Their argument was that I had to try something new and deal with my periods in a more efficient, \u2018sanitary way\u2019 (I use pads, also, I take out my own bathroom trash on my period and are sanitary about it) They thought tampons were more practical and less to deal with, yet my mother could not help me because \u201cIt had been so long that she forgot what it feels like.\u201d I refused to put in a tampon, saying that it made me uncomfortable and that I was not ready. They did not talk to me for a week until I put one in. (which I didn\u2019t) I got my period at sleep away camp 2 weeks later and wanted to make my parents proud. So I learned to put in a tampon with the help of a camp mom. Long story short, it was a disaster. Although I am glad I tried it I will probably not do it again. When I told my parents, they were not proud and just said that it was \u2018something that I needed to learn\u2018 even though I was completely fine before. I think it was totally unnecessary that my parents didn\u2019t talk to me for an entire week over a personal decision that shouldn\u2019t even concern them, but I can\u2019t help but think, were they in the right?

It\u2019s a silicone or rubber cup inserted into the vagina (much like a tampon), that just gathers the blood. Then you dump it out once every 12 hours, or more often as needed. No risk of TSS, which is great. When it works well it\u2019s so much better (more comfortable and cleaner) than a tampon, it\u2019s cheaper in the long term, it\u2019s a lot more environmentally friendly because it\u2019s reusable, and you\u2019ll never have to worry about disposal bc it\u2019s reusable. But the drawbacks are that the first one costs more than tampons (like $40-50). you have to be even more comfortable inserting things inside yourself than when using a tampon with applicator (there is no applicator), and it takes a while to learn how to use, and during that time the process can look like a crime scene.

The poor thing was horrified at the idea of internal supplies. I told her that was okay too. Ultimately it's up to the menstruating person what they prefer.

And either way, it's totally your choice whether to use tampons or not. And it can be uncomfortable without necessarily being a health problem. I just wanted to talk about vaginismus and vulvodynia because it's important for those things to be out there and for people to know about it.", "Nta, this is really creepy. Nobody gets a say in what sanitary products you use. Your parents requests are completely unreasonable and inappropriate, it is really weird that they are so hung up on this. Is there an adult in your life you can talk to about this? Because this is not normal.", "I'm in my 40s and have given birth multiple times. I prefer pads. I'll use a tampon to swim and sometimes to work out.\n\nThey're called \"sanitary pads.\" Of course they're sanitary!", "NTA. Also some people can't wear tampons literally because of their anatomy. It's different than the typical and they can't wear tampons or cups. \n\nAnd even if that's not the case. You don't like to wear them. That should have been the end of the discussion.", "NTA. This is a weird thing to get obsessive about.", "NTA I can't imagine not talking to my child for a week because they don't want to use a tampon, that's ridiculous, a lot of people can't wear tampons especially at the start - I still hate them and use pads only and I'm in my early 20's. For swimming I can see why pads would be an issue and tampons would be better for that specific activity, if you're worried about mess maybe put some shorts over your pad and swimming costume but TO BE CLEAR if YOU'RE worried about it. You're parents are out of line and the fact you had to ask another mum for help is sad, also disappointed that it sounds like your dad is equally treating you badly despite having no experience or knowledge of what he's talking about.", "NTA, as a transmasc (Kinda in the name-) I know that periods suck, so whatever way you can be comfortable during them is the best option for yourself. Like if you prefer pads or tampons, or even cups, just do what you feel comfortable doing, that's the important part. It's your body, and that's not really a valid way to stop you from using pads, ESPECIALLY if your taking out your own trash and being responsible about it. Just do what makes you comfortable.", "NTA- I\u2019m 32 and refuse to use tampons. It\u2019s really no one\u2019s business but my own. It\u2019s very strange they have such a strong opinion about it. \n\nThey would probably have a conniption when they learn about period undies, which I use for about half my period when it\u2019s lighter.", "Absolutely none of their business whether or not you use tampons. Just seems weird that they\u2019d care. They are right that if you\u2019re swimming, you need a tampon, not a pad. But only for swimming.\n\nI hated the applicators for tampons. Always managed to pinch myself with them. Then I found OB brand tampons, and those were much easier. There\u2019s no applicator, so you just insert it with your finger. Some people might find that gross, but I never pinched myself with them.\n\nAlso, have you tried a menstrual cup? Some women love them. Thinking that would be fine for swimming, too.", "NTA- My mom DIDN'T want me to wear tampons but I used them (with the help on my awesome big sister) because where I grew up swimming was a thing all summer.  As I grew older I realized I didn't like them and they were uncomfortable for me (guess what?  my un-aroused or birthing vagina is short).  \n\nYour period products should be your choice.  I wish period panties or menstrual cups existed when I was young because I would've been all over that.", "NTA but your parents are huge AH. It is not up to them how you handle your period.  They are narcissistic.", "its really bizarre for your parents to obsess with what you do and do not do with your genitals. NTA.\n\nthat being said though i really hope you dont swim on ur period using a pad.. its not like a swim diaper it doesnt keep it all in one place, youd just be getting blood in the water. id recommend trying one of the cups as theyre more comfortable and arguably more sanitary", "They are great parents, but yes, they can sometimes be very controlling. They are just very stubborn and sometimes can be pretty narrow minded, but they are great people overall.", "I am with you on this and by golly I am mad at OP's parents", "Honestly, I'd call this abuse. They clearly are as you say highly misinformed on what clean is and you should not be feeling ashamed for using whatever products you want to!! They are lucky you aren't boiling cups in the kitchen.", "yes there is. I have tried talking to her about it but she just suggested I should find a therapist. I have asked my parents multiple times for therapy, but they have procrastinated it for about 6 months.", "LMFAO", "I\u2019m not exactly sure what she uses, but I think it\u2018s something like birth control where it gradually slows down and stops over time. But it\u2019s been 12 years since she had her last period \ud83d\ude05", "I'm assuming it's some type of blood thinner. I know there used to be commercials for a type of birth control that gave you periods like twice a year. I asked my doctor about it (years ago, no idea what the pill is anymore) and she said it was basically a blood thinner that she only recommends to people with very heavy periods or non-stopping periods.", "Thank you so much! I will definitely use this!", "She's a young teenager who needs to be taught the proper way to care for herself.  Her parents dropped the ball on this one. She did nothing.", "I'm curious as to why you think she's being weird over it, could you explain?", "Thank you!", "On,  and ask your dad to give you 5 reasons that he personally found tampons to be better for him to use when on his period", "Thank you for the info!", "I actually have these things called period swimsuits that work just as good as pads if not, even better", "OP I have given you my input. If I am the family doctor, I would have given your parents a well deserved earful on the importance of respecting your choice", "No, they're not great. They are abusive. Ignoring you for a week is manipulation. Its disgusting behaviour.", "on that note, pads are way more sanitary than tampons. it's a lot harder to get sepsis with a pad", "No, they are abusive. This kind of behavior in reaction to something that is and always should be your choice is nothing short of emotional abuse. NTA. Forcing you to use tampons was bad enough. That was coercive and a violation of your bodily autonomy. To then refuse to speak to you for a week because you refuse to comply with their coercion is totally over the edge. The fact that you still think they're great people says that you don't really have an understanding of how badly you are being treated. Please talk to a counselor if you can.", "Also you don't forget how to use a tampon. It doesn't matter if it's a decade - the technology doesn't change. That's a weird lie.", "So are you swimming with a pad on or free bleeding in the pool? If it's a public pool and you're swimming without a tampon I'd say YTA", "No, they don't sound great at all.  Very controlling, very stubbon, pretty narrow minded... that's abusive, not great.", "Just to clarify, I'm not saying YOU need therapy (at least not based on what you've said here)  I think that the way your parents are obsessing over you using tampons is VERY troubling.  I think maybe they need therapy.", "I'd tell a female family member you trust, this is not normal.", "I'm about 90% sure that \"she\" is an older male internet pervert, because there is no way this is real, but sure", "she tried to put a tampon at a camp to \"make them proud\"", "Any time! I didn't have much info about vaginismus when I first learned that I had it, so I make a point of telling people just on the off chance that someone reads the comment and finds that it helps solve a mystery for them.", "I wouldn't describe them as abusive, although I'm not saying they aren't AH because they are. I think every parent has a reason for what they do and what they suggest, she should talk to them and explain why she wants and they should listen because it's her body.\n\nAlso if they punish you by not talking to you if you don't behave well, that's something bad and not good for your mental health and it will afect you a lot when you get older.", "You do understand that she's under high pressure from her parents and it can be incredibly hard to guard your boundaries when it comes to your parents. Also her mom didn't want to teach her, so she took another option when it presented itself (a woman at camp willing to help). She did nothing weird or wrong", "Not talking to your child for a week because they wouldn\u2019t put something in their vagina is abuse.", "\u201cI think you need to understand why your parents insist you shove something in your vagina.\u201d  \n\n\nNo.", "alright you win"]}
