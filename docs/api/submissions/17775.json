My mother (46 F) had her last period about 12 years ago due to a period-stopping medication. I decided that I was not going to use tampons, a personal preference, that BOTH of my parents did not approve of. Their argument was that I had to try something new and deal with my periods in a more efficient, \u2018sanitary way\u2019 (I use pads, also, I take out my own bathroom trash on my period and are sanitary about it) They thought tampons were more practical and less to deal with, yet my mother could not help me because \u201cIt had been so long that she forgot what it feels like.\u201d I refused to put in a tampon, saying that it made me uncomfortable and that I was not ready. They did not talk to me for a week until I put one in. (which I didn\u2019t) I got my period at sleep away camp 2 weeks later and wanted to make my parents proud. So I learned to put in a tampon with the help of a camp mom. Long story short, it was a disaster. Although I am glad I tried it I will probably not do it again. When I told my parents, they were not proud and just said that it was \u2018something that I needed to learn\u2018 even though I was completely fine before. I think it was totally unnecessary that my parents didn\u2019t talk to me for an entire week over a personal decision that shouldn\u2019t even concern them, but I can\u2019t help but think, were they in the right? Am I the asshole?\n\nNOTE: They allow me to use pads, but they want to find a \u2018better\u2019 \u2018alternative\u2019 for them.

No risk of TSS, which is great. When it works well it\u2019s so much better (more comfortable and cleaner) than a tampon, it\u2019s cheaper in the long term, it\u2019s a lot more environmentally friendly because it\u2019s reusable, and you\u2019ll never have to worry about disposal bc it\u2019s reusable. But the drawbacks are that the first one costs more than tampons (like $40-50). you have to be even more comfortable inserting things inside yourself than when using a tampon with applicator (there is no applicator), and it takes a while to learn how to use, and during that time the process can look like a crime scene.

The poor thing was horrified at the idea of internal supplies. I told her that was okay too. Ultimately it's up to the menstruating person what they prefer.

It's your choice what you put into your body in such a sensitive area. \n\nAlso, if tampons are very uncomfortable for you, you might want to look up vaginismus-- it's a condition that causes the muscles at the entrance of the vagina to seize up and cause discomfort or pain when trying to insert something. It can be associated with anxiety and/or previous trauma (note that not all genital trauma is sexual-- I got vaginismus from having lots of UTIs as a kid and having a traumatic catheter test!)

But only if you want to try them, not for your parents.\n\nAlso want to add, period swimwear is a sham.

I personally hate them. There are so many more options out there today. Use pads or if you want to try period pants. If you come to a point where you are comfortable to do so, try a cup (personal preference).

You could try to compromise and discuss the other numerous options you have such as a menstrual cup, period panties, or reusable/washable pads; but I have a feeling your parents wouldn't be great at being receptive to that conversation. It's really weird they have a preference you tbh", "NTA\n\nFor the longest time I was so uncomfortable with tampons.  I never used them after my first time trying. After a couple of years I decided to try it again because I was having a super heavy flow (my flow is usually light or medium, so I was not prepared). I decided I'd use a tampon and a pad. After that cycle i actually found tampons useful and more efficient.  I would use a liner and a tampon during my cycle. Luckily i dont have a period anymore, bit i still keep pads, liners, and pads with me just in case someone needs one. \n\nIt didn't work for me at first but later did. A few of my friends only use tampons (they hate pads), and other friends only ever use pads (they're uncomfortable with the thought of using a tampon). And that's perfectly fine. No one forced me to use a tampon, but i was still taught how to use one. And no one forced me to use it when my flow randomly got heavy, it was my personal choice. It should be common sense because it's my body and I get to choose how I want to deal with personal matters. \n\nFirst, your mom/parents should have taught you how to use one, \"it's been a long time\" isn't an excuse. She could have looked it up to refresh her memory and then given you the run-down of how to use the applicator. \n\nNo one in your family is entitled to tell you what to use for your period. Unless they have a weekly meeting where they dig through the trash to examine what people tossed, there's no situation that would cause them to encounter your tossed pads out in the open and there's no reason they should be uncomfortable with you using pads. Pads are also called \"sanitary pads\", so they're meant to be sanitary ways to manage your period. Their argument about pads not being sanitary is invalid. \n\nYou dont like tampons now, and that's fine. You might prefer using them in the future, and that's okay too. What matters is what you're comfortable with NOW. That is no one's choice but yours.", "NTA. Your parents are controlling psychos. Whether you use pads or tampons is NONE of their business. \n\nHave you tried the \"skinny\" kinds though? They might be more comfortable for you.", "NTA.

We have both organic, unbleached disposable and reusable cotton ones as well as period panties. \n\nShe also has a menstrual cup which doesn't put her at any risk of TSS and she uses that when she's swimming. I bought her a teen sized one and explained how to insert it and verbally guided her while giving her moral support. \nI believe I also hiked MY foot and demonstrated (fully clothed) so she could try multiple methods of insertion. And did all this with no pressure.  She really wanted to swim and I did not know that menstrual swimsuits existed. \n\nI guess I'm on the opposite end. She's 14 and has had her period for 2 years now, but I will not buy tampons or scented pads. I explained to her my reasons why and admitted many people think I am crunchy for my avoidance of bleach entering my or her body.  I did tell her if she wanted to try them it would be when she turns 16, but she agrees with me that it's best to avoid bleach and tampons. \n\nI just can not imagine forcing her to only use one method.

It's super inappropriate, unhinged behavior for them to even be discussing it. \n\nYou do not *need* to wear tampons. Use what works for you, and know that if it is super uncomfortable, that could be due to **COMPLETELY NORMAL** differences in anatomy, like a retroverted uterus, a low cervix, or even a condition in which penetration by anything- tampons included- is painful. None of that is your fault, and you can't change it with willpower. You can work with what you've got and find a comfortable solution for you. If you need a non-pad alternative, try period *discs* which sit much differently than tampons or period cups, and work better for retroversion, low cervix, or short vaginal canals. If you want to lower the amount of disposables, reusable pads are great. I recommend Aisle/Period brand for pads, Jockey for period panties, and the Ziggy period disc.
