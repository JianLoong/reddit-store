He should pay off his debts before he thinks he can afford a PS5 or any non-essential, expensive item. \n\nI imagine there was no payment plan discussed so maybe in his mind $200 is genuinely good enough, but decent people would appreciate the help you provided and not take advantage of it and would have started paying it back forever ago. Definitely wouldn't have blown $500 on a PS5 and think there's nothing wrong with it.", "NTA.\n\nIt is completely understandable why this would annoy you.\n\nHe seems to think he's on some kind of payment plan with you though and I would maybe have a conversation about that because he probably thinks it isn't completely reasonable that all his spare cash will come to you.", "NTA. Text him and try to get him to set up a payment plan. If nothing else, the texts will be all that you need to win a claim against him in small claims court because he'll be admitting he owes you that money. He's never going to pay you back unless you make him.", "Nope. NTA. That was a dick move for sure. Always get it in writing if you really want it back.. but you could always take him to small claims court regardless if he promised to pay you back initially.", "**NTA - but...**\n\nUnless you had a specific repayment plan/agreement this one is on you.  Yes, you have every reason to be mad at him, and yes, he is acting like an irresponsible child (this is probably what got him in this situation to begin with) but you are stuck.  \n\nI would recommend you sit down and get it in writing now how much he will be paying you back per month going forward until this loan is paid off.  And then take this whole situation for what it is - a really big lesson - do not loan money to anyone!!  God Luck!!!  \n\nPS - if you want to be petty - hide a game or controller - but it will only help you feel better!!", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to be upset.   It's not like there is a repayment schedule of $200 a month that he met.   He simply owes you the entire amount and  should be paying you back rather than spending it on luxury goods.", "INFO: Is there some agreement that he'll pay you X amount each month?", "NTA. He's TA. But seriously take your decision to heart. Never lend money again. And if your next bf has \"money issues\" dump him on the spot. Real men know how to manage their finances.", "NTA. Stop making this an issue; just sue him in small claims court and get it over with.", "good op you already learned one of the commandments of life, never lend money it ruins relationships, if you don't get anything in court damage his PlayStation, buy a pen drive killer it burns devices when plugged in and you can deny you had anything to do with that if there is no way to get your money back", "Oh god NTA. \n\nIf he has enough money to buy a PS5, he has enough money to be paying you back more quickly.

Unless you have a legal contract with him, just be happy he is paying you back and use it as a lesson learned. It sucks, but you never said when he had to pay you back, or by how much.", "NTA, it's so disrespectful to buy a luxury item like that when you owe someone money. Been in the same situation, drives me absolutely nuts.", "NTA. A PS5 is an expensive luxury, not an immediate life necessity for a person who needed a money loan. If he's only paying you $200 per month it'll take a year to get your money back. You're not a financial institution, you're his ex-girlfriend. Any responsible adult would try to get this over with as quickly as possible, but that's clearly not his priority.", "NTA. I'd be quite upset that he didn't pay me back. Ouch.", "NTA. He\u2019s being a selfish people user. I\u2019d think long and hard if this is someone you want to be more financially entangled with ie through marriage. He seems fairly irresponsible.", "NTA.  Paying you back should be his top priority after his bills are paid.", "He doesn't care to pay you back, especially if you two still live together after breakup. Take the smoke claims court you will win a judgment, then you have to figure out how to collect on the judgment just cuz you win doesn't mean you get paid.

But you'll likely have trouble if you don't have in writing when* he's supposed to pay you back. \nAnd if he has, for example,  a year to pay you back then until that year is up he gets to spend his excess money however he wants.", "NTA, at all.  Geez!", "NTA. My first thought was how nice it was of him to buy you a PS5, you might be able to resell it at a higher price to recover some of your loan to him.", "Not anymore he isn't because I'm getting that money back come hell or high water.", "That's how I feel but he disagrees obviously. As far as I'm concerned he has already had an entire year and never even tried to pay back a cent.", "\"As fast as possible\"\n\nNah. If I loan someone money I wouldn't expect them to live an ascetic life until they pay me back.\n\nIt should CERTAINLY take priority over a PS5 though.\n\nSorry, I forgot that this sub is not for moral judgement, but for mindless cheerleading.\n\nGO OP NTA YOU THE BEST GIRL DUMP THAT ASSHOLE!!!\n\nHappy now?", "He said $200/month minimum but \"if I have extra I'll pay more\". Obviously he has extra and is not paying more.", "I don't want ALL his spare cash but if he has $600 to buy a new console then he could put some of that toward actually paying back.", "I have several texts from him repeatedly saying he would pay it back and I have a paper signed by him when I originally loaned him the money that said he would pay it back after a few months at his new job.\n\nHe stayed at that job for only 2 months then worked 4 hours a day at door dash so at that time he genuinely didn't have the money to pay anything back.", "He said he would pay $200/month minimum but he also said \"If I have more I will pay more\". I know how much he makes and he is constantly telling me about the bonuses he gets at work.", "Of course I learned this the hard way. I should have known but he was full of empty promises and \"I love you\"s. At least now I know.", "He said he only has enough to pay back $200/month and obviously that is a lie. I tried multiple times while we were together to get him to agree to a payment plan and he only attempted to pay anything back after we already broke up and I said I would take him to small claims if he didn't pay me back.\n\nSo yes technically I guess we agreed to $200/month but he said \"If I have more I will pay more\".", "I broke up with him 2 months ago so marriage is not an issue.", "I hope you had this in writing, because this may well be worth taking him to small claims court for.  I think he's going to do his best to avoid paying you.  NTA\n\nEDIT - looks like you have it in writing that this is a loan he'd agreed to pay back AND evidence of prior payments.

Although... 2 months IS a couple of months. Good luck.", "NTA but unless you take extra measures, it sounds like you'll have to deal with him paying you whenever he feels like it.", ">He said he would pay $200/month minimum but he also said \"If I have more I will pay more\"\n\nDo you have this specific part in writing/texts?", "Everybody has to learn everything the hard way. It's just how we are. Dumb arrogant humans. The important part is that you have learned.", "This tends me toward YTA. If $200 a month was what he agreed upon, then live with it. I'm not sure why you feel the need to monitor the purchases of your ex-boyfriend. That's just going to stress you out.", "Is he making the $200 payments?", "Bullet dodged on your part. Good for you for not being a doormat. Sorry I missed that in the original post.", "Maybe have that drawn up? I don't know if it's possible but have the whole thing written up with the deadline and make him sign it, or you go to court immediately.

He makes more now than he ever made before so I'm sure he can afford it at this point.", "I'm not monitoring his purchases at all.\n\nHe literally walked in and said \"look what I bought!\".", "As of right now he has made 2 payments. I think he only paid that because he pays half rent and just added it on to that. Next month is the last month of rent and I don't think he will still pay after that.", "Don't worry about it. Easy to miss. I just thought you'd like to know he has already been kicked to the curb.", "Good for you. He\u2019s digging his own grave with his bad financial choices. Glad you had the foresight to not be thrown in the with him.", "As long as you don't have a contract you will likely waste your time", "my friend had to take someone to court for about $5000, he was a \u201cmechanic\u201d who took her car and said he was fixing it, added additional fees for additional \u201cproblems\u201d and in the end, when she went to check out what was going on, he had not fixed her car but had in fact stolen pieces off of it. Even though it was all in writing, and even though she won, it\u2019s been about 5 years and he has not even paid half of it back :/ court was surprisingly unhelpful.", "You have no contract therefore i don't think anyone will care.", "You talk of integrity as you call someone you don't know pathetic. You're a child.", "Never give money out and expect it back, they had a payment plan in place, they no longer are SO'S  there ROOMMATES now, and by what u just said u obviously have no mental health training whatsoever, Noone is entitle to other people money or possessions even of there in a relationship", "I hate to say it, but probably not \n\nYou need to have a serious conversation, all logic, no emotion, about about the payment expectations and how he hasn't met them. \n\nHe may try to bait you to get an emotional reaction. Hold steady and keep to the facts. \"You promised $200 per month and as of today, you have only paid $400 of the X amount you owe. We had an agreement and you are not holding to your end. I made this loan in good faith. This is hurting me financially. When will you pay the balance\".\n\nRinse and repeat. Put any agreement in writing.\n\nThis is a shitty way to learn a lesson about loaning money. Never \"loan\" more than you are comfortable \"giving as a gift\" in case things go pear shaped.\n\nBeen there. Sadly, lost a friendship over it. They would borrow and pay back until....they didn't. \n\nAfter months of chasing it, I told them id that I'd \"forgive you this debt and consider it a gift. However, I'm not loaning you any money again\". They said thank you and then a few months later asked for another loan. Nope. Reminded them of our conversation. They got mad and never contacted me again after.", "He has agreed multiple times in writing I have several texts. I'll write up a contract right now.", "Sounds like they DO have something in writing though.", "I have two checks with his name on them written out to him and multiple written signatures that he would pay back. How is that not a contract? I'm typing up something more official right now.", "Not true! It doesn\u2019t have to always be a written contract. The text messages and receipts will most likely be enough OP!", "What has this even got to do with MH training? \n\nNo one is entitled to a brand new console.
