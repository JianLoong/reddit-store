It's usually my oldest (17) or youngest (14) for a couple reasons but this time my wife decided that our middle daughter (16) will be giving up her room no matter what. My youngest also has a cat that my middle daughter is scared of.\n\nMy wife recently told the kids that my MIL is coming to stay with us for 6 weeks and announced that it's our middle daughter's turn to give up her room. My middle daughter complained but I talked to her about it and tried to come up with a compromise, and I tried to get my wife to agree that one of our older kids' rooms would be better for a few reasons. First, our middle daughter's room is not near a bathroom, MIL gets up multiple times at night, and she just hurt her ankle. Second, middle daughter's room is big enough that we could put an air mattress for one of the other kids. Our oldest daughter's room isn't big enough for that and our youngest daughter has a cat that middle is afraid of so she can't sleep in there. There's also the issue that I strongly think our middle daughter might be autistic and any change in routine is hard for her.\n\nThen I said that if our middle daughter sleeps on the couch, our youngest daughter has to keep the cat in her room at night. My youngest daughter refused because the cat will wake her up and want to play but I told her it's fair for middle to not want the cat harassing her while she sleeps and that she either keeps the cat in her room or she gives MIL her room.\n\nMy wife and youngest are saying this is unfair and I'm just trying to get middle out of giving up her room but I truly think this is a fair compromise. Middle will give up her room as long as the cat is away from her at night. I told middle if they keep the cat out at night, I will take her to sleep at my parent's house every night until my MIL leaves but my wife is refusing that too because her mom is already upset that middle likes my parents better (my parents have lived a half mile from her until she was born, MIL lives across the country.) and that this will make her think middle is sleeping there to get away from her.\n\nAITA for saying either my youngest gives up her room, keeps the cat in her room, or my middle sleeps at my parents house while my MIL is here?\n\nEdit: I wanted to say that \n\n1) I had no idea MIL would be staying for that long until my wife announced it to the kids\n\n2) I do not agree with the kids giving up their rooms, especially for that long, but that's for another post ", "created_utc": 1682868431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133utrs/aita_for_telling_my_youngest_daughter_that_she/", "score": 480, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once I proved it was affecting their health and more help was available once diagnosed they gave in but that took time. It then takes years for them to be assessed once they go on the waiting list. Usually four years is the average but they are trialing a new system which has less of a wait so we volunteered to use that. Even though it may not be fully affective as it doesn\u2019t evaluate them in different setting or even in person. Just over a screen when those on the spectrum may manage or hide their condition effectively in certain settings and definitely react differently in person and it\u2019s far more obvious then. Even then after they finally agreed to refer them for diagnosis it took over another year to be seen even on the new system. We are waiting on the results and have been told that takes another two months after the assessment has taken place. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "Seems like middle daughter is actually the one that gives her room up every time, at least held it it anyway. She\u2019s the one that has somebody else camping out in her room no matter if MIL is staying in the oldest or youngest\u2019s rooms.", "They didn\u2019t say that. They said it \u2018seems\u2019 that way meaning it\u2019s an assumption based on what we know from the post. And this is what this sub is for, it\u2019s a judgement sub. \n\nPlus the fact that this situation of the MIL kicking kids out of their bedrooms is a recurring thing in this family shows that he hasn\u2019t put his foot down for his kids in the past.", "OP must be one of those slime orb enemies in the starting areas of an RPG cuz I sure as hell ain't seeing any sorta spine her. Talk about a depressing post...", "1000% OP. You are the two adults in control of who stays in the house and for how long. Not the kids. Don\u2019t make this their problem. How deeply shitty.\n\nAnd if this is about your inability to have equity in your marriage, consider that it\u2019s not hurting you: it\u2019s deeply unsettling your children, which is (drumroll) super shitty for them.", "That is such a good solution. Bravo", "Yes, but these things can also creep up on you, especially if you're naive or haven't seen how toxic relationships work. You might meet someone you think is sane, date, marry, have kids, and slowly the crazy is getting revealed. Just a little bit here and there, until you're essentially trapped, in an unhappy marriage, pouring yourself into work because that's where you can find peace. It's a miserable situation.", "Change the pronouns around from he to she. Your comment is fucked up and victim blaming as hell. Not ok.", "I, unfortunately, have also seen people change, quite dramatically, with life circumstances.  A guy, I know, was married about 20 years, when the loss of his job  and problem finding another sunk him into a depression that was a total personality change. My heart broke for his family. Yes, they got him help. But a lot of damage was done, and some of him was changed forever.\n\nAnother had PTSD from military service crop up about 15 years into the marriage.  He changed.\n\nLife, itself, can tinker with people, quite dramatically.  The only question for the spouse, if whether to stay with this person, or not.", "oh god yes, totally", "Don't have kids with someone unless you're pretty certain they're not an asshole. If you do, you're at fault.", "Sure, let's try it:\n\n>Ok, but he didn't just suddenly become difficult overnight. She met him, they got together, they were a couple for however long, they got married, etc.\r  \n\r  \nAt some point OP decided that her husband was a sensible choice of partner to have children with. Three of them, no less.\r  \n\r  \nIf you knowingly bring children into the world with someone who makes people miserable, you're an asshole.\n\nI will stand by every word of this.\n\nIf you're in an abusive relationship, you're not to blame. We know how that works, we know how hard it is to escape, we shouldn't put the onus on the victim.\n\nIf you choose to bring children into an abusive relationship, then you absolutely are to blame. You are the one dragging innocent parties into it, people who would find it even harder to escape than you. People who are even more vulnerable than you. You are not the chief victim anymore, you have become an accomplice.\n\nUnless we are talking Fritzl-levels of lacking consent, then the children were your choice, which makes them your responsibility. Who else's responsibility would they be?", "Except for when the other person is deceptive and doesn't reveal their negative traits until after you're already trapped...", "Be pretty certain they're not an asshole. If, after five years of being with them through thick and thin, you're still not pretty certain, don't have kids with them.\n\nYou owe this to your children, who will be unable to get away if you don't. It is your responsibility."]}
