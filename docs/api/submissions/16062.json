It's usually my oldest (17) or youngest (14) for a couple reasons but this time my wife decided that our middle daughter (16) will be giving up her room no matter what. My youngest also has a cat that my middle daughter is scared of.\n\nMy wife recently told the kids that my MIL is coming to stay with us for 6 weeks and announced that it's our middle daughter's turn to give up her room. My middle daughter complained but I talked to her about it and tried to come up with a compromise, and I tried to get my wife to agree that one of our older kids' rooms would be better for a few reasons. First, our middle daughter's room is not near a bathroom, MIL gets up multiple times at night, and she just hurt her ankle. Second, middle daughter's room is big enough that we could put an air mattress for one of the other kids. Our oldest daughter's room isn't big enough for that and our youngest daughter has a cat that middle is afraid of so she can't sleep in there. There's also the issue that I strongly think our middle daughter might be autistic and any change in routine is hard for her.\n\nThen I said that if our middle daughter sleeps on the couch, our youngest daughter has to keep the cat in her room at night. My youngest daughter refused because the cat will wake her up and want to play but I told her it's fair for middle to not want the cat harassing her while she sleeps and that she either keeps the cat in her room or she gives MIL her room.\n\nMy wife and youngest are saying this is unfair and I'm just trying to get middle out of giving up her room but I truly think this is a fair compromise. Middle will give up her room as long as the cat is away from her at night. I told middle if they keep the cat out at night, I will take her to sleep at my parent's house every night until my MIL leaves but my wife is refusing that too because her mom is already upset that middle likes my parents better (my parents have lived a half mile from her until she was born, MIL lives across the country.) and that this will make her think middle is sleeping there to get away from her.\n\nAITA for saying either my youngest gives up her room, keeps the cat in her room, or my middle sleeps at my parents house while my MIL is here?\n\nEdit: I wanted to say that \n\n1) I had no idea MIL would be staying for that long until my wife announced it to the kids\n\n2) I do not agree with the kids giving up their rooms, especially for that long, but that's for another post ", "created_utc": 1682868431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133utrs/aita_for_telling_my_youngest_daughter_that_she/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That seems the most fair to all the kids (given that the oldest and youngest give up their rooms the most).
