It's usually my oldest (17) or youngest (14) for a couple reasons but this time my wife decided that our middle daughter (16) will be giving up her room no matter what. My youngest also has a cat that my middle daughter is scared of.\n\nMy wife recently told the kids that my MIL is coming to stay with us for 6 weeks and announced that it's our middle daughter's turn to give up her room. My middle daughter complained but I talked to her about it and tried to come up with a compromise, and I tried to get my wife to agree that one of our older kids' rooms would be better for a few reasons. First, our middle daughter's room is not near a bathroom, MIL gets up multiple times at night, and she just hurt her ankle. Second, middle daughter's room is big enough that we could put an air mattress for one of the other kids. Our oldest daughter's room isn't big enough for that and our youngest daughter has a cat that middle is afraid of so she can't sleep in there. There's also the issue that I strongly think our middle daughter might be autistic and any change in routine is hard for her.\n\nThen I said that if our middle daughter sleeps on the couch, our youngest daughter has to keep the cat in her room at night. My youngest daughter refused because the cat will wake her up and want to play but I told her it's fair for middle to not want the cat harassing her while she sleeps and that she either keeps the cat in her room or she gives MIL her room.\n\nMy wife and youngest are saying this is unfair and I'm just trying to get middle out of giving up her room but I truly think this is a fair compromise. Middle will give up her room as long as the cat is away from her at night. I told middle if they keep the cat out at night, I will take her to sleep at my parent's house every night until my MIL leaves but my wife is refusing that too because her mom is already upset that middle likes my parents better (my parents have lived a half mile from her until she was born, MIL lives across the country.) and that this will make her think middle is sleeping there to get away from her.\n\nAITA for saying either my youngest gives up her room, keeps the cat in her room, or my middle sleeps at my parents house while my MIL is here?\n\nEdit: I wanted to say that \n\n1) I had no idea MIL would be staying for that long until my wife announced it to the kids\n\n2) I do not agree with the kids giving up their rooms, especially for that long, but that's for another post ", "created_utc": 1682868431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133utrs/aita_for_telling_my_youngest_daughter_that_she/", "score": 1078, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It solves every issue here,  correct?", "ESH, please grow a backbone", "The whole situation is horrid.  Why would you have a pet that one of your children is afraid of??  Why is MIL visiting for 6 weeks when you don't have a spare room and can't accommodate her without upending the whole house?

My grandma wpuld NEVER come for 6 weeks during the school year and demand to displace a kid. What in the actual fuck were they thinking? You are the asshole for letting your wife bully your kids, esp middle daughter. The idea that your wife would force any of your daughters to sleep on the couch for 6 weeks AND let grandma wake them with bathroom trips.multiple times a night AND letting the cat roam the house to bug them all night is horrible. \n\nMy dude it is time to put your foot DOWN. No kids give up their rooms for grandma. Ever. And get your wife to marriage counselling, the fact that she would inform--not ask you--about a six week visit from MIL during the school year is straight up fucked.", "Yo. Six fuckin weeks is a long time to be kicked out of your room no matter who it is. Like that's a long time to not have a private space for a teenage girl.

Full power to send anyone out of the space at any time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's also not unreasonable to have youngest keep the cat in her room since it's her cat, and the reason for her not wanting the cat in her room is what the middle daughter will have to deal with on the couch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSix fuckin weeks man. Jesus Christ.", ">I told middle if they keep the cat out at night, I will take her to sleep at my parent's house every night until my MIL leaves but my wife is refusing that too because her mom is already upset that middle likes my parents better (my parents have lived a half mile from her until she was born, MIL lives across the country.) and that this will make her think middle is sleeping there to get away from her.\n\nBecause middle child will like her grandmother SO, SO MUCH when she is forced out of her own bedroom for SIX WEEKS. If your wife doesn't want middle daughter to hate her grandmother, then don't force her out of her own room!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFO: Has middle daughter been required to have another child share with her when her grandmother has visited before?

He states he 'suspects'. For all we know they are still in the stage of gathering info and statements,  waiting to see if its an anxiety or other reaction, speech and language may be involved to check things out there. Its a long long long and tough process to even get considered for a diagnosis , with so many fucking hoops to jump through. Often,  if you haven't checked everything else out first with the schools SENCO, you'll be sent back to that. The process can take years,  guys. YEARS. Plus kids aren't seriously put forward for ASD assessments until year 1/2 , so age 5/6 , due to a whole plethora of reasons ( with some exceptions and different circumstances), due to how differently they all develop.  We don't know if this has been pushed for for a while. \n\nSo please,  chill, and accept you got one piece of a big puzzle  and stop soapboxing about this.\n\nTo the actual issue, your wife needs to get a grip.

Of course  grandma isn't flavour of the month, it sounds like her  visits are hugely disruptive and upsetting. No one likes that.\n\nIf she insists on this, she should have your room as the invitee should host.  Wife can have sofa, you can either be nice and stay with her or crash at your parents.

Autism in itself does not need treatment. A child may have some struggles or difficulties that may require certain therapies, however. Some of these therapies may be hard to obtain without diagnosis, and in those cases, a diagnosis may be the best path forward. However, an autistic person who does not need outside services, only accommodation in some areas, absolutely does not need to be diagnosed. Many of us elect to be 'undiagnosed' as adults for insurance, immigration, or personal reasons. We don't like to be tracked and monitored, which is what the 'diagnose all autistics' mindset can lead to.
