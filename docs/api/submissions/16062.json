It's usually my oldest (17) or youngest (14) for a couple reasons but this time my wife decided that our middle daughter (16) will be giving up her room no matter what. My youngest also has a cat that my middle daughter is scared of.\n\nMy wife recently told the kids that my MIL is coming to stay with us for 6 weeks and announced that it's our middle daughter's turn to give up her room. My middle daughter complained but I talked to her about it and tried to come up with a compromise, and I tried to get my wife to agree that one of our older kids' rooms would be better for a few reasons. First, our middle daughter's room is not near a bathroom, MIL gets up multiple times at night, and she just hurt her ankle. Second, middle daughter's room is big enough that we could put an air mattress for one of the other kids. Our oldest daughter's room isn't big enough for that and our youngest daughter has a cat that middle is afraid of so she can't sleep in there. There's also the issue that I strongly think our middle daughter might be autistic and any change in routine is hard for her.\n\nThen I said that if our middle daughter sleeps on the couch, our youngest daughter has to keep the cat in her room at night. My youngest daughter refused because the cat will wake her up and want to play but I told her it's fair for middle to not want the cat harassing her while she sleeps and that she either keeps the cat in her room or she gives MIL her room.\n\nMy wife and youngest are saying this is unfair and I'm just trying to get middle out of giving up her room but I truly think this is a fair compromise. Middle will give up her room as long as the cat is away from her at night. I told middle if they keep the cat out at night, I will take her to sleep at my parent's house every night until my MIL leaves but my wife is refusing that too because her mom is already upset that middle likes my parents better (my parents have lived a half mile from her until she was born, MIL lives across the country.) and that this will make her think middle is sleeping there to get away from her.\n\nAITA for saying either my youngest gives up her room, keeps the cat in her room, or my middle sleeps at my parents house while my MIL is here?\n\nEdit: I wanted to say that \n\n1) I had no idea MIL would be staying for that long until my wife announced it to the kids\n\n2) I do not agree with the kids giving up their rooms, especially for that long, but that's for another post ", "created_utc": 1682868431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133utrs/aita_for_telling_my_youngest_daughter_that_she/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to put your foot down about this blatant disregard for you and how your kids feel. 6 weeks is too long and was not agreed upon by both of you.", "INFO: why can\u2019t you give up your room?", "MIL gets your room, wife sleeps on couch, and you sleep in middle\u2019s room on a blow up bed and make the 6 weeks into a core memory about the time you two got to be \u201croomies\u201d.", "This is demeaning. There may be many reasons they haven't gotten an evaluation. It may be just dad who thinks the middle daughter has autism, maybe dad tried to talk to mom and she was against an evaluation, maybe they don't have the money to get an evaluation, maybe it means traveling to a different part of the state/country to get evaluated... It seems like dad is trying to get the middle daughter out of giving up her room, so it isn't necessarily as drastic as you make it seem that NOBODY is taking into account the child's potential needs.", "dude this is the post to talk about those other things, it's like you're laying down and washing your hands of finding a solution", "ESH minus the kids and the cat.\n\nYou gotta ask your wife permission to make a second post? How about you put your foot down and tell her and your MIL to either stay at a hotel or take the couch. \n\nYou find out the same time as your kids that your MIL plans to stay for more than a month and disrupt your family's routine, and that's okay to you?\n\nHow about you  stand up for your kids if you aren't gonna stand up for yourself. Most of these posts real or not, wouldn't be posted if people weren't such cowards or weren't married to AHs.", "It's not \"for another post\" OP. Stop hiding because you're scared of the answers telling you that you suck. You came here asking for advice and opinions, so stop hiding as though you didn't ask for this. No matter what, YTA. The real question now is if you want to keep being one, or if you want to be a good father to your children enough to actually listen to what everyone is saying.", "Do all your kids a favor and get them locks for their bedrooms.  Let your wife and mil know that six weeks is to long to take the kids rooms.  She is welcome to the couch or can get a hotel.", "If put that in this post itself tbh", "No it isn\u2019t. Grow a spine. And get your daughter evaluated for fuck\u2019s sake. Wow.", "You keep saying that but don't make that other post. ESH", "Where is the other post you need more help", "That's where you're misunderstanding. That argument *is* what's important to this issue. Put your damn foot down and listen to what everyone here is saying. 6 weeks is an absolutely insane amount of time for any level of room displacement. She can stay in a hotel, on the couch, or kindly pound sand", "No ... because the kids are NOT.", "Around here a parent just need to make a request to the school district to have an assessment done.", "My (27 y/o) wife was recently diagnosed with autism because my in-laws were too neglectful to bother when she was a child. Trust me when I say your kid's life will be a lot harder if you don't get her evaluated ASAP. Her mental health and well-being are much more important than whatever your wife thinks", "So you\u2019re just going to let her suffer?", "Your wife is definitely a massive problem. 6 weeks is entirely too long for your child to be kicked on to the couch for. You need to put your foot down.", "your wife is an AH, and so are you for not having a backbone", "So what you\u2019re saying is, you have far, far bigger issues than this post.\n\nNo one here is going to be able to separate that issue plus the length of your MIL\u2019s visit to answer your specific question. \n\nESH- this whole situation is unsustainable.", "So lemme get this straight- you, without a spine, refuse to just help your child because your wife is a dictator? See how stupid that is? Jesus at this point just throw the whole marriage away.", "So your just a doormat? Poor kids fathers not even enough of a man to argue for them.", "You are her parent. If you think she needs medical care- such as being accessed for a disability- you get her medical care.\n\nYour wife doesn't get to unilaterally deny your child basic care", "Your wife has a longstanding habit then of steamrolling you and the kids then. Family pets are a family decision, because it's adding a new family member. Not a \"Mom wants to spoil one spesific child.\" A family member being on edge because of a pet is one of many reasons why you discuss family pets before getting them. (There is also the fact that cats cost money in terms of food, vet care, toys, litterbox and chore time. You need to know how the cats getting taken care of beforehand.) \n\nSix weeks is nuts to stay. Especially when it's dispositioning another family member. Your wife has gotten too much leverage and isn't treating anyone in the nuclear family like a equal. Not you her partner or showing respect to the kids.", "But then he'll be called abusive if he doesn't just agree with everything she wants.", "Assuming that OP and their wife sleep in the same room, that decision shouldn't be made by the wife unilaterally either. Wife should not be giving up other people's rooms.", "Unless the major decision is whether to have the child evaluated by medical professionals.", "Yup. Dude married a very difficult woman. If he ever gets the courage to divorce her, she will put him through hell, during and then ever after.", "He's willing to give up one of his children's rooms, so what makes him so special? If he doesn't want his MIL to take any room in the house he needs to actually stand firm in this decision.", "Ok, but she didn't just suddenly become difficult overnight. He met her, they got together, they were a couple for however long, they got married, etc.\n\nAt some point OP decided that his wife was a sensible choice of partner to have children with. Three of them, no less.\n\nIf you knowingly bring children into the world with someone who makes people miserable, you're an asshole.", "He will be the asshole if he gives up anyone's room for mother in law. She can sleep in the living room, a hotel, or in her own bed at her own house. He doesn't get to give up other people's rooms either."]}
