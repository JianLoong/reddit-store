I know she has the history of over stepping boundaries and of taking much more than she's actually given but she's never been rude or hostile basically she gets snarky when something happens that she doesn't like but she's never been rude. Also, my time where I live is up and I'm blessed to look forward to life changing money. I wanna help people but would prefer to do it on my own accord. Her family says I'm  conceited because I'm in a post to give to others and shouldn't care who gets my goods. For clarification, she has a job, food on her table etc. Shes not struggling and doesn't depend on charity.

They are thieves. They stole stuff from a charity!", "NTA I've never understood people who pick through donations when they are not low income or in distress. It's an incredibly greedy thing to do. Thank you for donating instead of reselling! You sound like a kind person who's boundaries have been repeatedly violated.", "NTA. What a thief. So gross", "NTA. She shouldn't have taken the clothes without asking, even if they were meant to be donated. They could have been intended for a women's shelter, which would need the clothes more than they do. \n\nIt was petty of you to make them return the clothes, but I'm going to assume the nonprofit needed them more than your roommate.", "NTA - oh boy they suck. Just because you were donating them to a non-profit does not entitle them to anything. They are filthy thieves.", "NTA-it's your stuff you decide what to do it...they don't get any say in that.", "[deleted]", "NTA.  If they don't want to be treated like thieves they shouldn't act like thieves.", "NTA - you were giving your property to a charity.  Your roommate stole the donation.
