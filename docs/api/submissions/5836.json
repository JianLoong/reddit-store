My brother (who usually never opens) it, decided to open it today, and while we were eating dinner, he decided to start reading out my diary in front of my parents. I flipped the fuck out on him, and told him that if he were to keep reading through my notes (personal information) that I was going to remove his devices from my iCloud account. That night, I took all my diary entries off the cloud. The next day, he did the same thing again at dinner, but this time with a more personal diary entry. (He must\u2019ve saved it, while it was still out on the cloud) I didn\u2019t flip out, or yell at him. I told him in the calmest way possible that I was gonna remove his devices from my iCloud account, and that there was nothing he could do to stop it.

It shouldn't be the job of anyone regardless of age to let family stab you in the back and still have theirs. Younger siblings don't get a free pass to be AH without consequences.\n\nAnd at 18, he should be able to figure out how to set up an apple account...\n\nYou can still forgive someone and love them but still give them consequences for their actions. \n\nThis issue doesn't sound like it will damage their relationship.
