Would they have the exact same reaction?\n\nBut he needs to understand that until he can earn back the trust, you may not be so willing to help or do things for him and that is he on his own for a while.\n\nAnd do not help him out for a while, let him deal with the issues and problems all on his own until he learns that lesson.", "NTA. He knew what would happen and still did it. Reading it in his own was bad enough, reading out loud was bizarre. Not sure how anyone can find stuff like this funny?", "NTA. Saw in OPs comments that his little brother is 18. That is old enough to know it is wrong to read someone else\u2019s diary. And also, what 18 year old can\u2019t setup an Apple ID?", "PLAY STUPID GAMES WIN STUPID PRIZES. I WOULDN'T HELP HIM DO SHIT.", "OP, please remove his access and don't feel bad at all. His PARENTS can setup an account for him.", "NTA Not only did he read your diary, but he read it out twice.", "NTA but also he 'doesn't know how' is he a child or is this weaponized incompetence? Because literally all you need to sign up is to enter an email address. If he's a child make him a kid's account through family sharing, and have your parents administer it.", "You\u2019d be surprised how much the clueless jokester brother can get away with when it comes to lack of life skills", "100% he could\u2019ve figured out if he wanted to. \n\nHe was leeching off his brother\u2019s Apple Music subscription, that\u2019s the reason he refused to make his own account.", ">Did he just....not believe you the first time? \n\nBased on his actions and the mom's reaction, no he probably didn't. He probably is used to pushing it and getting away with it because mom won't punish. \n\nHis reaction to op saying it's happening now is because he fully didn't expect to be held to task for his actions.\n\nA lot of people live that life, and make it to adulthood before someone rug pulls them.", "First I'm not defending your brother his actions, or even excusing your mother's lack of enforcing discipline towards him. Instead think about a 4 corner approach. 1. He did it for attention. 2. He didn't think you would get that mad and cut him out of the storage. 3. What all adolescent boys think he was going to get away it  wihich  stamps him an ass hole cut his storage off. 4. He did it on purpose and didn't care now this one needs immediate action, brand him ass hole, cut his storage off, then advise him you owe him another branding of an asshole and a embarrassing burn \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25. If it's 1 or 2 you need to find out why. Effective Communication comes from all parties involved or communication breaksdown then everyone gets branded an asshole and has their storage cut off. Remember he didn't cut it off from you no matter if he knew or not. Lastly if a 1 or 2 leave you feeling unsure then I advise you to take the higher ground and leave him with the notion that he better grow eyes in the  back of his head. You could always brand him ass hole later GOOD LUCK \ud83e\udd1e", "Awww", "NTA! Too bad, he brought it on himself.", "Maybe he can learn some manners after he figures out how to set up an account.", "Dude please ignore this person. Get therapy. Your job is not to cater to this child\u2019s whims and make his life easier.", "Yep.  My 3 yr old just pissed off my 5 yr old (after having already been corrected by me) then exactly 1 min later comes crying that the 5 yr old \"Doesn't want to talk to me!!\" Okay, well.....", "NTA. Play stupid game get stupid prizes.", "He won\u2019t because \u201cthat\u2019s just how he is\u201d \ud83d\ude44", "He's not a child. He's an evil little sh*t who got what he deserves.", "that you know of", "Dont be na\u00efve.  You really think he is not going to tell his friends?", "So you hope.", "Heh, I figured he won't because the idiot can't even set up an icloud account.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
