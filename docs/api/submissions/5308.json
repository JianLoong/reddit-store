This is just you affirming your boundaries and making sur you are not shorting a waitress because you can't say \"no\" to your date.", "Then when it's time to pay, just say separate checks.\n\nAnd let her cause a scene, they would have *her* escorted out for causing it, not you.", "No, see, 'cause then you're just a scammy asshole.", "If that's the law where he lives then yes that would be better.", "I'm the calmest guy lol, most people I know have never seen me raise my voice or anything.\n\nIt's just not worth the risk from my point of view. What if she leaves first? What if she physically doesn't let me leave? Etc", "Nope .. you have low self esteem and don't know how to stand up for yourself", "I know that standing up for myself doesn't mean taking advantage of other people. Revenge is how toddlers and religious fanatics express themselves, not healthy adults."]}
