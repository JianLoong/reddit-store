I live with roommates and I don't have a lot of money at the moment. I can afford necessities but I need to count my pennies before buying any luxuries.\n\nI have a cousin Jean f27 who I'm fairly close with. I don't have any siblings and I think of her as the sister I never had.\n\nLast year, I was in a much better financial position. It eventually went downhill due to me being unexpectedly laid off from my job and a bunch of surprise expenses, hence why I'm not doing so great now.\n\nLast year, Jean was in a tough spot as she had car problems and had to move back in with her parents after getting evicted from her apartment. She was working a minimum wage job and was really struggling.\n\nI paid the mechanic bill for her car which was around $300, and I loaned Jean an additional $900 to help her with her expenses. I know the whole deal about loaning family members money and wasn't too worried about whether or not she'd ever pay me back.\n\nJean paid me back $400 5 months later and told me she'd pay back the rest when she could but she never did. Once again, I don't mind. I know she needed the money. I'd feel absolutely evil if I watched her be unable to afford necessities when I could've helped.\n\nBut here's where I could be an asshole.\n\nA couple of months ago, Jean started a Hulu account that she pays for. She gave me the login and told me I can use it.\n\nLast week, I noticed that I couldn't log in to the account and I texted Jean to ask about it. She read the text but didn't respond for a few hours so I called her.\n\nHer boyfriend picked up and he told me that they changed the password, and explained that HE doesn't think it's reasonable that I get to use their Hulu without paying for it. He said if I want to share the account again, I should contribute to cover the cost of upgrading the subscription to unlimited devices.\n\nI told him that's fine but no thanks, I'd rather not then, I'll get my streaming fix elsewhere. \n\nI mightve come off as abrupt or blunt I guess because Jean later called me and accused me of being \"condescending and disrespectful\" to her boyfriend. I apologized and told her I didn't mean to come off that way, and repeated our conversation to her. \n\nJean said she was sorry but they can't let me freeload. I laughed and told Jean that she can't possibly be calling me a freeloader. She said I am if I'm just going to use her for the subscription. \n\nI told her that I thought we had a relationship where we helped each other out, and brought up the money I loaned her which she hadn't even paid back fully. Jean called me petty and said that doesn't make me entitled to use her account. I told her I don't even flipping care about the Hulu account. She said I'm materialistic for keeping score, and told me to leave her alone and hung up the phone.\n\nMy aunt and parents are now also saying I'm petty and telling me to apologise to Jean as I'm not treating her like a good family member.

It's not \"keeping score\" to remind her that she freaking owes you $500 (or that you gifted her $300). If you chance to talk to her bf again, ask if he's the one who's going to be setting up the repayment schedule. She should be paying you interest. This is ridiculous \"freeloading\" on her part. \n\nAnd until your aunt and parents make good on her debt for her, they have nothing to say on the matter.", "In a group chat I would just say - petty? Petty is owing someone (put amount here) and cutting off a hulu account. and just say - If I really wanted to be petty I would be taking her to small claims court go recover the rest of the money she owes me. NTA", "NTA. Jean has some nerve. Letting you use the Hulu is the least she could do. This is her boyfriend and I bet she didn\u2019t tell him how much she owes you. They said pay or no Hulu and you said fine no Hulu. You did nothing wrong. These people are nuts.", "NTA. And never ever loan her money again. \n\nIt's also gross that she's letting her boyfriend interfere in her relationships with others. I would distance myself from them.", "NTA. You\u2019re not be petty.  Call it a lesson learned and move on. Also remember everyone who took her side and make sure they\u2019re on your do not help list. The same thing will happen if you help them out.", "Obviously NTA. It would've been petty to ask her how she was paying for Hulu when she still owed you so much money. \n\nThe audacity of her to call you materialistic and petty when she's miffed over 10 bucks a month while owing you over half a grand. Ridiculous.", "NTA you help each other out, Jean should be able to see that.\nYou\u2019re not entitled to her account but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about.\nThe rest of your family are annoying af for suggesting you should apologise.", "NTA at all... Why is she spending money on a 'luxury' item such as Hulu when she still owes you money?  The least she could've done is share the account with you and NOT expect you to pay since she isn't repaying you the money.  You helped her out, now she should be polite and show her appreciation by sharing at the very least.  If she can afford to pay you back, she should.\n\nIt almost sounds like she is ashamed of not paying you back and is trying to make you out to be the 'bad' person, when really she is in the wrong for not repaying you, especially when you are now in a tight financial situation.  Or she's trying to write you off so that she doesn't have to repay you.  \n\nShe's the one being petty, NOT you.", "NTA.  I'd tell your parents and aunt thar you will apologize when your cousin finishes paying you back the $800 she still owes you.", "NTA they are. You certainly don\u2019t owe anyone an apology.", "NTA, tell her pay the money she owes you and you can then afford your own Hulu account", "Info: is it possible the boyfriend is now the one who is actually paying the bill for Hulu?  If so, then his stance is reasonable. He doesn't owe you anything.  If not, then it's not his place to have a say in this at all, and he should have handed the phone to his girlfriend.  Either way, it sounds like your cousin is just parroting the boyfriend's opinion, because her position doesn't make any sense at all.  If anything, it should be something like, we'll go halves on Hulu, and I'll pay your half as a part of my debt to you.", "NTA. You\u2019re not petty for bringing up the copious amount of money you lent her that she never even paid back after she called you a freeloader. It\u2019s not even about the money you lent or the Hulu account like you said, it was the audacity of her randomly accusing you of being a freeloader for using her Hulu account after all you\u2019ve done for her. If paying for unlimited screens was really the issue boyfriend could\u2019ve been way nicer instead of saying \u201cyou\u2019re using us and you should pay us if you want to use it since you\u2019re just mooching\u201d.", "NTA\n\n*Freeloader* \u2026\u2026 that\u2019s a little rich coming from\u2026\u2026", "NTA at all\u2026 but keep an eye on her it sounds like boyfriend is pulling the strings and manipulative.", "NTA Jean is a freeloader & a shitty friend", "??????????

Even for a year, you\u2019re looking at less than $200 max. And she still owes you $800. That\u2019s not being petty.\n\nIf she owed you like $10 and you wanted to bring it up or small stuff, eh. Maybe. \n\nYou should ask her for the money back (even if you never see it). Cause you don\u2019t deal with freeloaders.", "NTA.  Time for her to pay you back the money she owes.", "NTA.

What hypocritical, entitled behaviour from them both. I can only assume your aunt and parents have been told a different version of events.", "NTA- guess that means we\u2019re all freeloaders in my family as we literally share all streaming services between all of us. It\u2019s what we do for family. Your cousin is nuts and so is her bf. Like I\u2019ve done. Get a $30 firestick and jailbreak it. It took me like ~10 minutes to do so by watching a YouTube video on how to do it.", "INFO is the boyfriend paying for his use of the account?", "I'm going with NTA because I guess by their logic my family and friends are freeloaders, using my accounts that I was already paying for, without any expectation to help pay for it. Nah, fuck that. Get your money back and find better friends.\nI do the same thing with my friends, including lending them money when shtf. One of my friends had a tooth crack and needed an emergency extraction, paid me back in full the next month. The same friend has been lending me his car for a few months because mine is waiting on parts. Find friends that actually care.\n\nEdit: just read it properly and saw that it's your cousin. How are my friends better \"family\" than your actual family?", "NTA  but if you want to be over the top petty I would ask her for the money that she owes you  still... literally  the actions you said that  you  took are basic  questions  of why you were  kicked off and didn't seen rude or anything  at least to me...", "She's an AH for not paying what she owes you.\n\nYou're an AH for expecting her to add a permanent additional monthly cost to her budget and for implying that it is in any way comparable to loaning her money for a necessity when she was in a tight spot.\n\nESH\n\nEdited to add:\n\nTo the people declaring that Hulu doesn't charge for additional devices, here are some statements from the site:\n\n\"Hulu subscribers are able to stream from two different screens at one time.\" \n\n\"[...] but only two of them can be streaming simultaneously. If you attempt to stream from an additional device, you may see an error message on that screen.\"\n\n\"If you\u2019re a Live TV subscriber and need more than two screens, you have the option to get the Unlimited Screens Add-on.\"\n\n\"You can change your Home network up to four times per year. If you attempt to update your Home network a fifth time, you\u2019ll run into an error message.\"\n\n\"Our Live TV plans are intended for single-home use. If you have two houses, or plan to use Hulu in multiple locations, one of our other plans may be a better fit. If accessing live TV in both places is important to you, we\u2019d recommend signing up for a second Live TV account.\"", "I lean toward ESH.\n\nIf you're truly not bothered about non-repayment, that shouldn't have been something you threw in Jean's face. You're either cool with something or you aren't, and it's unfair to create an environment where somebody thinks everything is fine as you're holding that trump card in your pocket to pull out who knows when.\n\nJean should, of course, repay her debts even if there's no pressure to do so, and does need to refresh herself on what the definition of a freeloader is.\n\nI also think this could be a situation where the password change/no more sharing was more her BF's decision than hers, I'm not sure, but if the account sharing worked prior to his arrival in her life, he could be the factor behind the change. That might have been embarrassing for Jean to talk about- maybe she felt sharing that would put him in a bad light. It was him, after all, who said sharing would be fine if you contributed. That's possibly why she was dodging your phone calls as well.", "NTA.  It sounds like you were really generous to your cousin and she is not very grateful.  I will say in one area that both of you are the asshole, that is sharing the password.  Idk why but that is a big pet peeve of mine.  It is basically stealing so you should get your own account or not use the service.  The boyfriend is most wrong here because he has no involvement in the situation and shouldn't be making decisions for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

With that, you would like to set up a payment plan so that there is no misunderstanding about the money being a loan and not a gift. \n\nI would tell my family to kick rocks unless they want to pay the money owed, since everyone is in agreement about freeloaders.", "NTA. Jean can pay you back the rest of the money she owes.", "NTA.   I would ask her for a schedule to pay back the money she owes you so you don't have to worry about anyone being a freeloader or score keeper.", "NTA.", "NTA fortunately, you have learned that your family has no boundaries. When you have some more gray hair, you will also learn a saying\u2026this too shall pass. This boyfriend? Probably gonna pass. Periods of prosperity? This too shall pass. Periods where we have to dig in and just do what we can? This too shall pass.\n\nWhat will NEVER pass is how we treat people. Changing a password without a conversation? Asshole move. Calling you a freeloader? Also a dick move. Yeah, you have some on your side too, but you learned a very valuable piece of information at a time when it\u2019s not gonna hurt you. Count it as a win and see her at family get togethers.", "Sounds like someone is in her ear and it\u2019s causing her to feel differently than she did before. She\u2019s going to realize a lot of her relationships will change if she pulls the rug out from under them.", "Freeloading, keeping score, materialistic?? THEY made it about money not you. After such a response I would take her to small claims court for what she owes you. NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019d be more adamant about the money if she wants to be petty and start fights. Don\u2019t apologize. If anything SHE should be apologizing.", "NTA. Do not apologize. Do not give her more power. If you cave now, she\u2019ll keep hitting you up for money. Best to shut down that gravy train.", "NTA\n\nGross behavior by Jean. Never loan her money again. Something tells me she's the type who'll ask with no shame", "You are being petty.  The Hulu account has nothing to do with the loan at all.  She does not have to share the streaming service and in a lot of the different ones out there, some of them are coming down on the 'sharing accounts'.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin is a petty push over & your family needs to butt out.", "Sounds like this is only an issue because her boyfriend made it one. Unfortunate that she's in a shit relationship.  At least now you know where you stand.", "NTA\n\nJean is letting her boyfriend drive the decisions and this will continue to get deteriorate.", "NTA. Take her to small claims court and make sure your family knows the reason.", "NTA I'd remind the bf she still owes you $500", "NTA", "Can't wait for Netflix to make a show about this called \"Jean is Awful\"", "NTA. You are entirely in the right. If Jean had played her cards right, this is how she could have paid you back. What the...?", "Basic Hulu is $80/year. Say you split in half and pay $40/year. She owes you $800, that's equal to her paying your half for the next 20 years. NTA", "Man, it's not evil at all to not give the little that you have to someone just because they're doing worse. Don't fall into that trap, you need to put yourself first. You'd have $800 more if you did right now, and your relationship with Jean was - as you clearly see - not strengthened in any way by your act. Also, why did her whole family of aunts and parents that are harassing you let her down in that way?\n\nNTA, but you gotta value yourself #1", "NTA. Time to call in that debt. She owes you.", "I'd invoice her for the rest of the money", "NTA\n\n> I know the whole deal about loaning family members money and wasn't too worried about whether or not she'd ever pay me back.\n\nBased on this, Im assuming that you didnt have her sign anything promising to pay it back. Jean's boyfriend made the decision to change the password and got hurt when his plan for free cash backfired. I wouldn't be surprised if he made Jean make that call and Jean first felt personally offended after you called out her hypocrisy. \n\nThey're now mad at you for their own faults, and you lended them on good faith without a signature. Good luck getting your money back.", "It's time to take Jean to small claims court. NTA", "NTA. Heck, up the pettiness score and send her a bill for the rest of what she owes you!", "NTA\n\nAnd no, reminding her that she still owes you money is not petty. Taking her to small claims court will be petty, and something I would absolutely do.", "So you are materialistic for reminding, not even asking back the 800 dollar, but somehow does not take into account she is asking money for the hulu account.  NTA", "Sounds like the boyfriend  is a controlling asshole", "I think the real asshole here is the boyfriend. You cousin hopefully will find out sooner rather than later. Either way you are NTA.", "NTA but her boyfriend is. I am glad you hassled him.", "Tell them all you'll quit being petty when they hand over $800.  NTA.", "NTA but it seems like the BF is the TA here cause I bet it was his idea, and he seems controlling.", "NTA if you want to be petty then let her know you are taking her to small claims court. Suddenly sharing a $10 Hulu account won\u2019t seem so bad when faced with attorney fees and court ordered payments", "NTA go NC...", "NTA. Your cousin and her bf total AH", "NTA, jean and your family seem delusional for calling you petty. She's still owes you almost a thousand dollars and had the nerve to call you a free loader lmao.", "NTA - you\u2019re \u201cfreeloading\u201d using something they already pay for wether you use it or not, and she\u2019s not borrowing money from you, which you can\u2019t use while she uses it?\n\nYou\u2019re not petty. Its not petty to say \u201cyou owe me 800$ if you want want things to be even\u201d. I mean have you really used 800$ in streaming services? Jean just burnt a bridge.", "Remind her that when you were told what the new stipulations for sharing the account were, you said no thanks. Her boyfriend interpreted it as condescending and felt the need to tell her. And she decided to make it into an issue.\n\nEverything that happened after you said \u201cno thanks\u201d was caused by her. This new boyfriend is obviously a bad influence on her and was feeling salty about not being able to get you to subsidize her Hulu account which they probably struggle to afford.", "NTA but I definitely am getting major sus vibes from this boyfriend. He answers cousins phone, he thinks its unreasonable for op to be on the account, he's the one who was \"disrespected\" I don't wanna throw around abusive relationship accusations - but at a minimum these a major red flags", "NTA: \"Good idea! Give me the $500.00 you owe me and I'll use that to pay my part of the subscription.\"", "NTA. Fuck Jean, and fuck everybody saying you're the Petty Crocker in this situation.", "I\u2019d sue her ass in small claims court.", "NTA. She owes you that money and it\u2019s ridiculous for her to accuse you of \u201cfreeloading\u201d when she hasn\u2019t bothered to pay you back. If she can afford Hulu, she can afford a basic payment plan to start paying back what she owes you.", "You are NTA and now you know you can\u2019t trust Jean. She\u2019s chosen her BF over you and that is pretty unforgivable. I\u2019d cut her out. Any other relatives want to speak up always remember to say that she owes you $800 and maybe they should talk to her about that. Also\u2026:.how many months of Hulu did she owe you before that $800 would have been paid back. Anyway you are NTA.", "NTA personally I think they were trying to get you to pay for a better service and it backfired on them and now they\u2019re mad.", "NTA. Immediately call her on her debt so you can pay for your own Hulu. Sounds like her boyfriend is getting in her head\u2026", "NTA, I guess you know how she really is and how to handle her in the future. Hopefully, she doesn't come around asking for anymore favors. She burned you twice now, don't make it a third", "The boyfriend is waving a red flag.  Be there for your cousin. NTA", "Hulu's basic plan let's you use two screens at once. Boyfriend just wants a screen to himself. NTA.", "NTA- demand that she pay you back. If she has money for Hulu she should pay back her debts.", "NTA", "NTA for bringing up the amount, super the AH for calling after a few hours. Don\u2019t call people unless someone is dead or in the hospital! After 24 hours you can text again, and maybe call eventually. But calling is an emergency action, and not having Hulu is not an emergency", "INFO\n\nYou know Hulu only costs $2 a month if you subscribe on Black Friday, right?", "Yeah there are very few relationships, if any, that are healthy where a boyfriend will do something like that", "I thought if it's \"not keeping score\" why would they kick her off their Hulu?  Whichever direction you look at it OP is NTA and the cousin is sure starting to smell that way.", "Lol for real, that's not score keeping that's basic accounting. It's not \"I lent you $500 a ways back and you paid me back but you owe me this\" it's an outstanding debt. OP is being gracious letting it ride as it has.", "Get the money back, OP.", "I\u2019d be looking up small claims court to see if it worth doing", "She still owes him $800", "Bingo!", "Boyfriend gives off \"my girlfriend/mommy pays for everything and that's ten bux not being spent on meeeeeee\" energy.", "I bet Jean is lying or embellishing the story as well", "Or just take what hulu costs out of the $500 owed", "Especially since cutting her off the Hulu account doesn\u2019t reduce the cost of Hulu. It actually didn\u2019t effect them at all. Calling someone a freeloader and petty when you owe them $800 is crazy.", "That's a good possibility. She may feel guilty for not paying you back, but not guilty enough to actually pay the money back. So she creates a situation she can twist until she's able to convince herself that she doesn't have to pay you back anymore because you're \"taking advantage of her generosity\" and being petty. Everything the cousin said applies equally, if not moreso, to herself", "This. He sounds extremely controlling.", "I like to do math on stuff, so here we go.\n\nSince the boyfriend mentioned a need to upgrade plans, they must be on the   \n$7.99 plan. Three people using it. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt and for roundings sake assume $3/month for OP's part.\n\nOP gave her cousin a total of $1200, of which $400 was paid back. That leaves $800.\n\nThis is roughly 267 months, or 22 years and 3 months.\n\nIt's safe to say u/stunningaxolotl577 has more than covered her part for the forseeable future.", "Same here. My family and I share access to all streaming services. My son\u2019s dad and son\u2019s dad\u2019s girlfriend even use my Hulu/Disney+/ESPN2 bundled accounts and they live halfway across the country. \ud83e\udd23 Some people think my close relationship with them is weird, but we don\u2019t. They\u2019re definitely family to me and always will be! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc \n\nMy mom pays for Netflix and shares her account with me and also my adopted little sister. However, a couple weeks ago, a message popped up on everyone saying that the account has been used in many different locations and that we needed to verify which one was the primary and that the others wouldn\u2019t be able to use it anymore. I\u2019ve read about accounts of that happening on Reddit for several months, but it was initially just happening to Netflix subscribers not in the United States. I guess they got around to enforcing it for U.S. subscribers too. Hopefully none of the other streaming services try this! Netflix is also by far the most expensive one and is not anywhere near the best IMHO. Anyway! \n\nOh, and NTA!", "OP would be an asshole if she started the aggression in the interactions, but as far as she's laid it out she didn't (could be missing details but nothing points to that necessarily being the case)\n\nThe way it is laid out, it was offered freely then just abruptly cut off without a word, which is rude. Then when asked the boyfriend was an asshole about it. OP should be fine with not being on the account but given how rude the others were I don't think it is reasonable to act like OP was acting entitled so much as reacting to the way they did it", "I think its fair to bring it up when she's being accused of freeloading. Throwing it in her face out of nowhere sure, but this wasn't nowhere, it was more or less evidence the accusation was bullshit", "Lmao what? Calling isn\u2019t an \"emergency action\"", "You must live in some alternate reality lmfao", "Yup red flags galore. OP is the only NTA here, sucks that her cousin let her narcissist bf do that. I bet she never told him about the money you gave her.", "Right, like if op was regularly \u2018locking them out\u2019 because of screen restrictions then like they should have talked about it, I get that frustration but this is just not the move all around", "well clearly they changed it so that OP couldnt use it..", ">Hulu boyfriend crisis \n\nBwahahaha!!!!! I needed that laugh, so thanks.", "Yeah, reminds me of something I heard from the Smothers Brothers a long time ago\u2026\n\u201cPa\u2026 I found out my girl was after me for my money\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut son, you don\u2019t HAVE any money\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know. She was stupid too!\u201d", "Exactly. I was with a dude like this. Happy to take any help, but we could never help the \"losers who need to learn to pay their way\" when we were able. For example, I had a really bad life threatening illness that put me in the hospital for 2 months and off work for another 2 months and my family and friends helped us out financially a lot, but God forbid I loan my sister $20 for gas a couple days before her payday a year and a half later. OP is NTA, but I bet Jean's bf is.", "Op qualifies for Spotify student which comes with Hulu and starz for $5 a month.

And I think sharing passwords for the different streaming services makes perfect sense because otherwise, it begins to get super expensive and way more than I ever paid for cable or satellite TV. I wish there was an easier/more affordable way to get the services you want in a personalized bundle for a discount. Sorta like the Hulu/Disney+/ESPN2 one that I have now, but with all of the big ones as an option. \n\nAnd people should be allowed to share passwords especially between family members\u2014it\u2019s not like 50 different people in 50 different places trying to use the same account. I understand why that wouldn\u2019t be allowed. But come on! Often times, the non-paying person using the account wouldn\u2019t pay for it themselves because they either can\u2019t afford it or don\u2019t watch or care to watch enough stuff on that particular service to justify paying for it. So it\u2019s not like they\u2019re missing out on extra money by limiting use to the household paying the monthly bill.", "I\u2019m definitely not anywhere near 60 and know a lot of people that would call if they need to talk to me\u2026.as for it \"not being for someone else\u2019s convenience\"\u2026..you know you don\u2019t have to answer it. Blocking someone who dared to call you seems pretty extreme\u2026.just don\u2019t answer the phone and text them to say you\u2019re not available if you feel the need. Or literally let them leave a message. Just because someone calls doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re harassing you or being rude. That\u2019s what missed call log and voicemail is for. I leave my phone on silent all the time and check it when I feel like. I return calls or text when it\u2019s convenient for me\u2026which is the point of a phone. No different from when landlines were a thing. I\u2019m not from some obscure culture\u2026I\u2019ve lived in the US and Canada my whole life.

And 95% of the time  it\u2019s warranted. Unsolicited calls are seldom good news. Of course they can leave a message, but they can also text. Calling is a way of avoiding screening. There\u2019s no reason not to text someone saying \u201chey can I call? I wanted to talk about x.\u201d If you call without a preceding text, it\u2019s an attempt to get me to pickup without knowing the topic of conversation. Hard pass."]}
