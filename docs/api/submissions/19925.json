I live with roommates and I don't have a lot of money at the moment. I can afford necessities but I need to count my pennies before buying any luxuries.\n\nI have a cousin Jean f27 who I'm fairly close with. I don't have any siblings and I think of her as the sister I never had.\n\nLast year, I was in a much better financial position. It eventually went downhill due to me being unexpectedly laid off from my job and a bunch of surprise expenses, hence why I'm not doing so great now.\n\nLast year, Jean was in a tough spot as she had car problems and had to move back in with her parents after getting evicted from her apartment. She was working a minimum wage job and was really struggling.\n\nI paid the mechanic bill for her car which was around $300, and I loaned Jean an additional $900 to help her with her expenses. I know the whole deal about loaning family members money and wasn't too worried about whether or not she'd ever pay me back.\n\nJean paid me back $400 5 months later and told me she'd pay back the rest when she could but she never did. Once again, I don't mind. I know she needed the money. I'd feel absolutely evil if I watched her be unable to afford necessities when I could've helped.\n\nBut here's where I could be an asshole.\n\nA couple of months ago, Jean started a Hulu account that she pays for. She gave me the login and told me I can use it.\n\nLast week, I noticed that I couldn't log in to the account and I texted Jean to ask about it. She read the text but didn't respond for a few hours so I called her.\n\nHer boyfriend picked up and he told me that they changed the password, and explained that HE doesn't think it's reasonable that I get to use their Hulu without paying for it. He said if I want to share the account again, I should contribute to cover the cost of upgrading the subscription to unlimited devices.\n\nI told him that's fine but no thanks, I'd rather not then, I'll get my streaming fix elsewhere. \n\nI mightve come off as abrupt or blunt I guess because Jean later called me and accused me of being \"condescending and disrespectful\" to her boyfriend. I apologized and told her I didn't mean to come off that way, and repeated our conversation to her. \n\nJean said she was sorry but they can't let me freeload. I laughed and told Jean that she can't possibly be calling me a freeloader. She said I am if I'm just going to use her for the subscription. \n\nI told her that I thought we had a relationship where we helped each other out, and brought up the money I loaned her which she hadn't even paid back fully. Jean called me petty and said that doesn't make me entitled to use her account. I told her I don't even flipping care about the Hulu account. She said I'm materialistic for keeping score, and told me to leave her alone and hung up the phone.\n\nMy aunt and parents are now also saying I'm petty and telling me to apologise to Jean as I'm not treating her like a good family member.

It's not \"keeping score\" to remind her that she freaking owes you $500 (or that you gifted her $300). If you chance to talk to her bf again, ask if he's the one who's going to be setting up the repayment schedule. She should be paying you interest. This is ridiculous \"freeloading\" on her part. \n\nAnd until your aunt and parents make good on her debt for her, they have nothing to say on the matter.", "In a group chat I would just say - petty? Petty is owing someone (put amount here) and cutting off a hulu account. and just say - If I really wanted to be petty I would be taking her to small claims court go recover the rest of the money she owes me. NTA", "NTA. Jean has some nerve. Letting you use the Hulu is the least she could do. This is her boyfriend and I bet she didn\u2019t tell him how much she owes you. They said pay or no Hulu and you said fine no Hulu. You did nothing wrong. These people are nuts.", "NTA. And never ever loan her money again. \n\nIt's also gross that she's letting her boyfriend interfere in her relationships with others. I would distance myself from them.", "NTA. You\u2019re not be petty.  Call it a lesson learned and move on. Also remember everyone who took her side and make sure they\u2019re on your do not help list. The same thing will happen if you help them out.", "Obviously NTA. It would've been petty to ask her how she was paying for Hulu when she still owed you so much money. \n\nThe audacity of her to call you materialistic and petty when she's miffed over 10 bucks a month while owing you over half a grand. Ridiculous.", "NTA you help each other out, Jean should be able to see that.\nYou\u2019re not entitled to her account but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about.\nThe rest of your family are annoying af for suggesting you should apologise.", "NTA at all... Why is she spending money on a 'luxury' item such as Hulu when she still owes you money?  The least she could've done is share the account with you and NOT expect you to pay since she isn't repaying you the money.  You helped her out, now she should be polite and show her appreciation by sharing at the very least.  If she can afford to pay you back, she should.\n\nIt almost sounds like she is ashamed of not paying you back and is trying to make you out to be the 'bad' person, when really she is in the wrong for not repaying you, especially when you are now in a tight financial situation.  Or she's trying to write you off so that she doesn't have to repay you.  \n\nShe's the one being petty, NOT you.", "NTA.  I'd tell your parents and aunt thar you will apologize when your cousin finishes paying you back the $800 she still owes you.", "NTA they are. You certainly don\u2019t owe anyone an apology.", "NTA, tell her pay the money she owes you and you can then afford your own Hulu account", "Info: is it possible the boyfriend is now the one who is actually paying the bill for Hulu?  If so, then his stance is reasonable. He doesn't owe you anything.  If not, then it's not his place to have a say in this at all, and he should have handed the phone to his girlfriend.  Either way, it sounds like your cousin is just parroting the boyfriend's opinion, because her position doesn't make any sense at all.  If anything, it should be something like, we'll go halves on Hulu, and I'll pay your half as a part of my debt to you.", "NTA. You\u2019re not petty for bringing up the copious amount of money you lent her that she never even paid back after she called you a freeloader. It\u2019s not even about the money you lent or the Hulu account like you said, it was the audacity of her randomly accusing you of being a freeloader for using her Hulu account after all you\u2019ve done for her. If paying for unlimited screens was really the issue boyfriend could\u2019ve been way nicer instead of saying \u201cyou\u2019re using us and you should pay us if you want to use it since you\u2019re just mooching\u201d.", "NTA\n\n*Freeloader* \u2026\u2026 that\u2019s a little rich coming from\u2026\u2026", "NTA at all\u2026 but keep an eye on her it sounds like boyfriend is pulling the strings and manipulative.", "NTA Jean is a freeloader & a shitty friend", "??????????

Even for a year, you\u2019re looking at less than $200 max. And she still owes you $800. That\u2019s not being petty.\n\nIf she owed you like $10 and you wanted to bring it up or small stuff, eh. Maybe. \n\nYou should ask her for the money back (even if you never see it). Cause you don\u2019t deal with freeloaders.", "NTA.  Time for her to pay you back the money she owes.", "NTA.

What hypocritical, entitled behaviour from them both. I can only assume your aunt and parents have been told a different version of events.", "NTA- guess that means we\u2019re all freeloaders in my family as we literally share all streaming services between all of us. It\u2019s what we do for family. Your cousin is nuts and so is her bf. Like I\u2019ve done. Get a $30 firestick and jailbreak it. It took me like ~10 minutes to do so by watching a YouTube video on how to do it.", "INFO is the boyfriend paying for his use of the account?", "I'm going with NTA because I guess by their logic my family and friends are freeloaders, using my accounts that I was already paying for, without any expectation to help pay for it. Nah, fuck that. Get your money back and find better friends.\nI do the same thing with my friends, including lending them money when shtf. One of my friends had a tooth crack and needed an emergency extraction, paid me back in full the next month. The same friend has been lending me his car for a few months because mine is waiting on parts. Find friends that actually care.\n\nEdit: just read it properly and saw that it's your cousin. How are my friends better \"family\" than your actual family?", "NTA  but if you want to be over the top petty I would ask her for the money that she owes you  still... literally  the actions you said that  you  took are basic  questions  of why you were  kicked off and didn't seen rude or anything  at least to me...", "She's an AH for not paying what she owes you.\n\nYou're an AH for expecting her to add a permanent additional monthly cost to her budget and for implying that it is in any way comparable to loaning her money for a necessity when she was in a tight spot.\n\nESH\n\nEdited to add:\n\nTo the people declaring that Hulu doesn't charge for additional devices, here are some statements from the site:\n\n\"Hulu subscribers are able to stream from two different screens at one time.\" \n\n\"[...] but only two of them can be streaming simultaneously. If you attempt to stream from an additional device, you may see an error message on that screen.\"\n\n\"If you\u2019re a Live TV subscriber and need more than two screens, you have the option to get the Unlimited Screens Add-on.\"\n\n\"You can change your Home network up to four times per year. If you attempt to update your Home network a fifth time, you\u2019ll run into an error message.\"\n\n\"Our Live TV plans are intended for single-home use. If you have two houses, or plan to use Hulu in multiple locations, one of our other plans may be a better fit. If accessing live TV in both places is important to you, we\u2019d recommend signing up for a second Live TV account.\"", "I lean toward ESH.\n\nIf you're truly not bothered about non-repayment, that shouldn't have been something you threw in Jean's face. You're either cool with something or you aren't, and it's unfair to create an environment where somebody thinks everything is fine as you're holding that trump card in your pocket to pull out who knows when.\n\nJean should, of course, repay her debts even if there's no pressure to do so, and does need to refresh herself on what the definition of a freeloader is.\n\nI also think this could be a situation where the password change/no more sharing was more her BF's decision than hers, I'm not sure, but if the account sharing worked prior to his arrival in her life, he could be the factor behind the change. That might have been embarrassing for Jean to talk about- maybe she felt sharing that would put him in a bad light. It was him, after all, who said sharing would be fine if you contributed. That's possibly why she was dodging your phone calls as well.", "NTA.  It sounds like you were really generous to your cousin and she is not very grateful.  I will say in one area that both of you are the asshole, that is sharing the password.  Idk why but that is a big pet peeve of mine.  It is basically stealing so you should get your own account or not use the service.  The boyfriend is most wrong here because he has no involvement in the situation and shouldn't be making decisions for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She owes you 500 to 800 bucks (depending on how you want to play it) that she clearly is in no hurry to pay back and has the gall to call you a freeloader? Her bf seems to have convinced her to try to scam you for more cash to upgrade Hulu and you're well within your rights to respond by formalizing the debt since she no longer sees your relationship as friendly. Get your money and don't worry about the opinions of people who don't think you deserve any consideration for your previous kindness. Sure, you aren't 'entitled' to her account, but she isn't entitled to not pay you back under those circumstance. She started this, so she has no room to whine.", "How about they give you the password for All of their streaming accounts and let op keep them till the debt to op is covered, kind of like garnishing wages.

(Now if he is because she can't afford it, then it is his choice to allow people on it or not, and he doesn't owe you any favors.) Your cousin seems to be influenced by a controlling, selfish bf. I hope one day she sees that and leaves him.\n2. Pretty lame logic your cousin is trying to pass off. It's petty of you to remember the money she still hasn't paid you back and that you haven't given her a hard time. But her cutting you off with no warning is perfectly OK. It's hard to forget how she is willing to treat you.\n3. Also pretty lame of your cousin to drag her mom into trying to defend her and blame you and then (her or her aunt) dragging your parents into this, too. I'm guessing they are just inclined to placate your aunt or the squeaky wheel.

You were not petty.", "I think that the boyfriend was the one being weird about the account. It would have been better if she explained that to you upfront.  She does owe you money. Please keep in mind that while she continues to owe you money, she can still have boundaries. You can't expect to borrow or use whatever you want until it's paid off.

It just breeds unhealthy behavior.", "NTA - Jean needs to tell her man to stfu and let you use as much damn Hulu you want because of the literal $500 bucks she still owes you and you don't hound her about. Instead of seeing your kindness and paying it back, she's taken it as weakness and either her or the bf just decided this ridiculous Hulu power move to see if they can get you for even more money!??!?!

Reiterate that she\u2019s being a freeloader if she doesn\u2019t pay you back soon, as she\u2019s had more than enough time to save up.\n\nAlso, tell her parents and your parents about the situation with you loaning your cousin $900 to fix her car and she still hasn\u2019t repaid the remaining $500 as of yet. Ask her parents when she will be repaying you for this loan. Let everyone know what\u2019s going on because I\u2019m pretty sure your cousin is saying something completely different to her parents.", "NTA - \n\nPerhaps an odd observation unrelated, how long has she been with said boyfriend. If her behaviour has suddenly changed I'd be concerned about abuse. Abusers love to isolate victims from their friends and families. Since the Hulu incident escalated so quick I'd worry something more is happening", "NTA. Really? She snitched you off to her mom and your parents, did you tell them about the 800 bucks she owes you? I would put this link in the group chat.", "NTA. She\u2019s being awful.", "Yeah....her boyfriend sounds like a bad influence and she sounds easily manipulated. I'd make certain your aunt knows that $500 is owed and you are awaiting payment. It can come from her or her daughter. In the meantime, they aren't welcome where you are if they are going to behave like  fair weather friends.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAlthough I think the bigger issue here is that Jean is willing to trash her relationship with you to appease her boyfriend. You might wanna have a conversation with her about that.", "NTA. How new is their relationship? If you look at her like a sister then might want to look beyond this argument and see if she is in a coercive relationship.\n\nWhilst what they have done is not correct and you think it's out of character based on your previous relationship with her then it might be that the boyfriend is the actual problem.", "NTA. How does her boyfriend get to dictate anything that you and your cousin have worked out between yourselves?? It\u2019s none of his business and I have a feeling he isn\u2019t paying for the subscription himself. He probably wants to use it for his own devices or give the password to one of his loser friends.

She still owes you that money, whatever she thinks of it.", "Her boyfriend sounds like the asshole here, I bet Jean didn't even care til her boyfriend made it a big deal.", "NTA but you should take a second to think about how everything was fine until her boyfriend got involved. \n\nHow long have they been together?
