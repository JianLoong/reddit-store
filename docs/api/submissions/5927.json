My children (13M and 9M) were left home alone that night and were not in the vehicle. I travelled from IN to MD to pick them up and my ex-MIL was trying to rush a funeral. I had to drive back to IN so that my wife (34F) could keep an eye on my two step-children (15M and 12M.) Then I returned to MD the next day with my two children to attend their mom's funeral. It has been 3 months now and the ex-MIL is planning a 2nd funeral in NY in January (I'm assuming so that family members who couldn't travel for the MD funeral can have one.) Here's where it gets sticky:\n\nI have spoken to both of my sons and BOTH of them say they do not want to attend a 2nd funeral. SO the ex-MIL gets them on the phone and says \"It's not a funeral, it's a birthday party!\" I showed my boys her FB post stating that it was a funeral. She is manipulating my boys by saying things in a misleading way. I spoke with the Aunt (23F) and told her that the boys simply did not want to go and I'm not going to force them. And furthermore, after the expenditures I've taken on since October and just providing a Christmas for 4 boys, that it wasn't financially feasible to take another long trip at this time. Not to mention, it's in the middle of a school week for the boys! They said they would pay for the boys to come alone. The boys both said they would NOT be travelling without me.\n\nSoon after this revelation the Aunt exploded on me saying that it wasn't fair for HER that I won't budge on sending the kids alone and why do I have to be present when the boys visit! I asked her why it was fair that she is completely disregarding the wishes of the boys. She then screamed that she was going to take me to court. Well good luck, sister. For clarity, I have invited them ALL to come to Indiana to see them and have plans in the works to take a \"cousin tour\" this summer with the boys.

She should be dripping honey at this point, because I'm assuming they all get to see the boys at your pleasure (as always, consult a family lawyer to make sure they can't actually do anything.

OP probably should make sure all is square on that front. I know shit all about grandparent rights but the two things I think I know, is not all states have them but some do, and they require a pre-existing relationship between the grandparents and children.

Then, at the appropriate time, it's in the best interest of all involved for the kids to have a happy relationship with their mother's family. \n\nWhen some time passes they are likely to understand that they made a bad call but, in the meantime, people need to realise that grief undercuts rational behaviour.\n\nAdult behaviour is to realise that, monitor the  situation and when things calm, reassess.
