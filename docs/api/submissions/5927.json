My children (13M and 9M) were left home alone that night and were not in the vehicle. I travelled from IN to MD to pick them up and my ex-MIL was trying to rush a funeral. I had to drive back to IN so that my wife (34F) could keep an eye on my two step-children (15M and 12M.) Then I returned to MD the next day with my two children to attend their mom's funeral. It has been 3 months now and the ex-MIL is planning a 2nd funeral in NY in January (I'm assuming so that family members who couldn't travel for the MD funeral can have one.) Here's where it gets sticky:\n\nI have spoken to both of my sons and BOTH of them say they do not want to attend a 2nd funeral. SO the ex-MIL gets them on the phone and says \"It's not a funeral, it's a birthday party!\" I showed my boys her FB post stating that it was a funeral. She is manipulating my boys by saying things in a misleading way. I spoke with the Aunt (23F) and told her that the boys simply did not want to go and I'm not going to force them. And furthermore, after the expenditures I've taken on since October and just providing a Christmas for 4 boys, that it wasn't financially feasible to take another long trip at this time. Not to mention, it's in the middle of a school week for the boys! They said they would pay for the boys to come alone. The boys both said they would NOT be travelling without me.\n\nSoon after this revelation the Aunt exploded on me saying that it wasn't fair for HER that I won't budge on sending the kids alone and why do I have to be present when the boys visit! I asked her why it was fair that she is completely disregarding the wishes of the boys. She then screamed that she was going to take me to court. Well good luck, sister. For clarity, I have invited them ALL to come to Indiana to see them and have plans in the works to take a \"cousin tour\" this summer with the boys. I am not denying them the right to see them, just for this one specific instance.\n\nAnyway, AITA?!", "created_utc": 1672318847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy4uvf/aita_for_not_making_my_children_attend_a_2nd/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't even imagine the grief they're going through right now. No, they should absolutely not be forced to attend *any* funeral for their late mother. They should be allowed to grieve on their own terms, not forced to grieve in a way that is socially expected. I hope they are in some sort of support group or therapy. There's no good age to lose a parent, but 9 and 13 is an especially difficult age. Keep standing up for them against these manipulative family members, they need someone on their side.", "NTA. One funeral is enough, especially for young children. In my opinion. Thank you for hearing your kids and honoring their wishes.", "NTA- The boys don\u2019t want to go. It\u2019s traumatic, plus the stress of travel and missing school. They are the ones in the most grief.  They decide how they grieve. If the mom had not rushed the funeral (we\u2019re there religious reasons for this? If so, I give a pass), then people from NY would have had time to get there. Are the in-laws just reacting out of stress, or are they always like that? If the latter, good riddance. \n\nI\u2019m confused why your sons had to go from MD to IN and then right back. We\u2019re there no relatives on the east coast to take them in for a bit?", "NTA.  Who in their right mind would force two kid to endure a 2nd funeral for their mother? Especially months after the fact.  I would tell them it would be within your rights to cut contact if they don\u2019t stop harassing the kids about this.  They have taken insensitive to the next level.", "NTA. \n\nMy grandmother, due to some ridiculous family infighting, had 2 funerals.  I only went to one, and we were very close.  The 2nd one was on my birthday, and I had plans, and frankly didn't want to have to relive another funeral.  \n\nYour family wants them there for their own selfish reasons.  But if the boys don't want to go, it is their choice.", "NTA and I don't think the travel issues are the only problem. \n\nUnless it's culturally normal for the boys' family, I think it's a bit odd to have a second funeral, and possibly upsetting. The boys have already been to one funeral, and now need to be allowed to grieve in their own way in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nYour children said they didn't want to go. Any other reason pales in importance to that. Yes you have other reasons but the important one is that they don't want to go.\n\nThat their aunt is threatening to sue you for respecting your children's want to not go is strange. That she's gotten volatile over their need to have you with them when going is also strange. I'd be careful if I were you about them visiting their aunt in case she does something stupid in her grief (like kidnapping them).", "NTA. Your sons are on a healing path that is different from their relatives, and in addition to processing the loss of their mother, they are living with new siblings and removed from their schools and friends. They are not adults and need you to steer them through this. Additionally, they will do better if the drama and rhetoric around their mothers death can be deflected. Continue to focus on their massive adjustment while calmly protecting them from emotionally-driven intrusions from family who are also grieving.", "NTA you dont, nor shouldn't make them attend any funeral. different people grieve differently, and they should be offered every opportunity but left to themselves to decide if they feel its appropriate. at the end of the day its THEIR feelings, and to some extent, how they'll interact with their family, though I believe they should respect the childrens wishes as well.", "What isnt fair is that they are forcing your kids to revisit a recent trauma they arent ready to revisit yet.\n\nThey are actively trying to manipulate them into doing so anyway, guilt tripping you, and threathening you to get what they want.\n\nYou telling them the kids do not want to come and them, in response, only focusing on the financial issue and offering to help that, is very telling. They do not care about the kids, they most likely want them to be props at the funeral.\n\nThey are acting abusive, selfish, and the whole thing is disgusting. NTA, go LC/NC", "NTA. Clearly this aunt is full of shit and at 23 I\u2019m not surprised she\u2019s dumb enough to think she\u2019s got a leg to stand on in court. Ignore it, do what you can to have the boys go no-contact with her, and support them in the best way you see fit.", "NTA \nYour boys have been through enough. They are old enough to make up their minds about this. Thank YOU for listening to them.", "NTA\n\nYour sons have already gone to their mother's funeral and said their goodbyes. They clearly don't feel like going through those emotions all over again. They have the right to say no and that should be acceptable. Their aunt needs to get over herself and respect her nephews wishes.\nLosing their mom is hard enough, they don't need to deal with any more sadness and unnecessary drama.", "NTA for putting your children's welfare first. Attending one funeral is traumatic enough. And you are making sure that side of the family remain in touch with your boys, which is the right thing to do", "NTA, having a second funeral will only mess with their heads, grief is hard enough already. Also are in Australia cause I don't see the Aunt's case being heard anywhere but kangaroo court?", "NTA. I'm relieved your sons are away from that situation & that you're honoring their wishes to not attend.\n\nLying to children like that is IMO absolutely unhinged. I feel sick trying to imagine their experience, if XMIL's plan had succeeded. \"It's a birthday party! Nope, it's a funeral!\" If their feelings are so blatantly disregarded, I'd bet the rage-blowback you're getting is rooted more in their indignation of having to explain to others why they aren't there.\n\nI'm sorry you're having to deal with this OP but it sounds like you're handling it with your sons' best interests as priority. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nWhy should children live through a second funeral of their mom. They already mourned her.\n\nYour ex-in-laws sound very selfish and manipulative.", "NTA. One funeral is enough. Stay the course. The kids are old enough to make that decision and they have.", "NTA x 1000 - Your children said they don\u2019t want to go and you\u2019re standing by they. That is what a parent is supposed to do. Your ex-mil is a bully and is trying to guilt trip you into doing something for her ego. She\u2019s selfish.", "NTA. As any operations research student would say: It's not optimal(for the boys) nor feasible (for you and the boys)", "NTA and thank God you took your boys before your MIL so she couldn't use them to fish for sympathy", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your sons\u2019 loss. Grief hits us all differently, and they\u2019re entitled to display that how they like. Keep in mind that your ex wife\u2019s family are also grieving - try to take their words with a pinch of salt and while stating fire, respond with compassion.", "NTA.  \n\nUnfortunately you made the situation with the aunt more complex than it needed to be.  You should have just said 'The boys don't want to go and I'm not going to force them to go.'   End of discussion.\n\nBut you introduced the financial concern, and that's a problem that can be fixed.  So now from the aunt's perfective you're being unreasonable because they've solved the problem that you presented but you're still\nnot sending them.\n\nGo back to her and tell her that they don't want to attend even with you there.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.

Stick to your guns.", "NTA. You're not the asshole here. Your ex-MIL is trying to manipulate your kids and you're standing up for their wishes and what's best for them. It's not fair for her to try to force them to go to a second funeral when they don't want to, and it's completely reasonable for you to not be able to afford another trip right now. Plus, it's in the middle of a school week and it's not fair to pull them out of school for something they don't even want to do. You're being a good parent and doing what's best for your kids, and it's not fair for the aunt to try to push you around like that.", "NTA, the minute there was a LIE INVOLVED about the nature of the event, these people lost any moral high ground here if they even had any! And I don\u2019t think they ever did; your children have already been to one funeral, another one is not necessary for helping them grieve.

End of discussion.", "NTA\n\nI was 13 when I buried my mother. Thats was bad enough. \n\nBut 3 months later when I was desperately trying to move on every minute of every day? It would have shattered me to go through that again. \n\nAs sad as it sounds the first funeral done in grief is kind of easier. The grief numbs you to other things and you kind of robot through it. \n\nThe worst part though? Everyone staring. Walking in as the family to take our spots with my little sister and stepdad with EVERYONE staring at us. Not him. Us. \"Oh those poor little girls.\" \"Just look at those girls who lost their mother.\" \"They are so young.\" \"What are those poor little girls going to do now?\" It felt like everything and everyone was all about us poor little motherless girls than it was about my mom. \n\nMaking your boys go through that again honestly would be torture.
