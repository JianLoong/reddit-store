My children (13M and 9M) were left home alone that night and were not in the vehicle. I travelled from IN to MD to pick them up and my ex-MIL was trying to rush a funeral. I had to drive back to IN so that my wife (34F) could keep an eye on my two step-children (15M and 12M.) Then I returned to MD the next day with my two children to attend their mom's funeral. It has been 3 months now and the ex-MIL is planning a 2nd funeral in NY in January (I'm assuming so that family members who couldn't travel for the MD funeral can have one.) Here's where it gets sticky:\n\nI have spoken to both of my sons and BOTH of them say they do not want to attend a 2nd funeral. SO the ex-MIL gets them on the phone and says \"It's not a funeral, it's a birthday party!\" I showed my boys her FB post stating that it was a funeral. She is manipulating my boys by saying things in a misleading way. I spoke with the Aunt (23F) and told her that the boys simply did not want to go and I'm not going to force them. And furthermore, after the expenditures I've taken on since October and just providing a Christmas for 4 boys, that it wasn't financially feasible to take another long trip at this time. Not to mention, it's in the middle of a school week for the boys! They said they would pay for the boys to come alone. The boys both said they would NOT be travelling without me.\n\nSoon after this revelation the Aunt exploded on me saying that it wasn't fair for HER that I won't budge on sending the kids alone and why do I have to be present when the boys visit! I asked her why it was fair that she is completely disregarding the wishes of the boys. She then screamed that she was going to take me to court. Well good luck, sister. For clarity, I have invited them ALL to come to Indiana to see them and have plans in the works to take a \"cousin tour\" this summer with the boys.

Let alone lying to them to manipulate them into going. MIL genuinely sounds dangerous, I would keep someone like that out of my kid\u2019s life no question.", "RIGHT! It\u2019s the exact kind of connection that these kids might reasonably make, and asking them to travel so soon afterward, by themselves, would just be needlessly re-traumatizing.", "If the problem is no money, giving money solves problem. That's not the only problem though.", "Absolutely right here. We missed my MiL's funeral due to the lockdowns. We discussed having the wake she never got, but instead my husband and I just went to her burial site 18 months later and had our own private moment there with her. We didn't want to drag our family through another funeral just to make us feel better.", "Familial kidnapping is like the number one most common form of kidnapping.", "That is a scary thought and the Aunt\u2019s threats of litigation and the grandma trying to emotionally manipulate the boys by calling the funeral a birthday party do feel like desperate attempts to get the boys there without OP around. But I hope that\u2019s just my overthinking talking.", "Same situation with my in-laws.  My husband died 10 years ago and they only want to see the kids on their terms and at their house(s) that are in different states.  I have said many times they\u2019re welcome to visit whenever they want but instead they berate me for not bringing the kids to see them or spend the holidays with them and prioritizing my family, etc.  \n\nAs the sole parent of those children now, alllllll of the burden of their care and well-being is on your shoulders.  How dare anyone add more to that burden for their own needs and feelings.", "Agreed wtf", "For a short time but this was 2am", "1. In the middle of the night? \n2. Blanket statement that doesn't necessarily apply to all 13 year olds.\n3. Not legal in all places.\n4. In the middle of the night? I just hope they knew she was going out.", "And it's necessary to speculate on this right now why?", "They're lying out their ass.", "Ha. Same! I cried a bit reading through this. I was a full on grown ass adult and it ~~cut me off at the knees~~ leveled me for *years*. \n\nEchoing your sentiment. I'm so glad their dad is protecting them.\n\nEdit: wrong expression. I was not humiliated for years.", "Do you mean me? I heard about this case in my local news. It was an awful situation.\n\nETA I would post a link, but it gives her name. \u201cSpeed and alcohol were to blame.\u201d", "It doesn't matter and isn't any of your business.", "No, with the biological mother passed, the children automatically go to the biological father.\nAlso, the mother passed in October the children have been living in Indiana for roughly 2 months. So. Again, they live in indiana, so it has to be done in indiana.\nThere is litterally nothing legally the MIL and aunt can do but \"demand\" visitation. And he is already permitting visitation. He does not, in anyway, have to send them to MIL or Aunt. He doesn't have to let them take them out of his sight.", "Also, Mom passed in MD, MIL and Aunt are not in MD their in NY.", "NTA. Please call a family law attorney and get guidance on how to defend yourself against future \"grandparents rights\" suits from these people.", "NTA but if she has sent this in written format (email/text), save a screenshot (timestamps of text included). You might need them for when she tries to say \"he can't be dad and keep them in school!\"", " Could you explain the part about why you had to\nrush back to Indiana so your second wife could keep an eye on your step children, presumably her biological children? Did wife # 2 drive with you to MD? Surely her two children 15M and 12 M were not home alone in Indiana?", "NTA When my husband passed away we had a rushed funeral where we lived in CA because my MIL was in such a hurry to get back to her home in NM to have another one.  My children 7 & 10 attended the first funeral.  We did travel to NM, but they did not attend the second one. It was too much for them. They were supervised by a friend of the family.  Don't let your ex-in laws bully you or your kids. Your children are going through enough. Please protect them from the pushing and pulling.", "Info: on what grounds would she attempt to sue you? Sounds like for not forcing them to attend a second funeral and go through all that again? \n\nEven without that info wow NTA - your protecting your younglings on so many levels", "NTA. Your ex-SIL is being controlling and treating your kids like property rather than like people. The attempted deception is pretty telling. Stick to your guns, you're being a good dad here. The fact that you're letting your boys be part of the decision and standing up for their refusal to go will do wonders for their strength and confidence going forward. Violating kids' boundaries teaches them to fear establishing boundaries or speaking up for themselves. Respecting kids' boundaries teaches them the opposite.  \n\n\nETA: the legal threat should be treated seriously. Go strict NC with your ex's family while you consult a lawyer. Only resume contact if the lawyer can confirm it is safe to do so without giving away any legal ground.", "NTA at all. You are doing the right thing. Your aunt and ex-MIL are acting desperate bordering on creepy. \n\nI would say they are afraid of losing the ability to see the kids but you indicated they are welcome to come. \n\nI would def recommend keeping copies of things like them describing it as a birthday party and other communications, at least until you can see which way this is going to go if they are just grieving people who are acting out because they can't understand people don't grieve they way they do, or if there is something more nefarious going on.", "You are not the asshole, dear. Your former relatives-in-law are simply proving why they are better off as the \"former\" instead of the \"current\".", "NTA- they want to traumatise the boys again because it\u2019s convenient for them? Hell no", "NTA - By not making them go to a thing they don't want to go to you are respecting their autonomy as humans with emotions and feelings of their own, which is good. The other family members are being selfish in asking you to disregard their feelings, which is bad. Nobody needs two funerals, and frankly it may interrupt their grieving process if they have to go through that experience over again. I honestly feel like this is just a way for the ex-mil and aunt to get some attention and they're pissed they can't use your kids as props, because I've never ever heard of doing two funerals for the same person.", "NTA it\u2019s not bad enough seeing her dead once? And WTF it\u2019s a Fucking birthday party THATS FUCKING MESSED UP KIDS:COME IN THINKING ITS A BIRTHDAY PARTY JOKES ON YOU ITS YOUR DEAD FUCKING MOTHER", "NTA", "I told those boys that if they wanted to go, I would absolutely make it happen. They still said no.", "Not at all! They were in the care of my best friend. We did not know the trip was going to end up being a week as MIL rushed the funeral. Once we found that out, we made the decision to take her home while we returned for the funeral.", "She is under the impression that I am trying to withhold the boys from them, yet I have extended the invitation for a visit in my home. They expect me to ship the boys to them instead. That is what I am refusing.", "13 and 9. Yep, qualified to make lifelong decisions \nIn the 12th century.", "Thanks for the clarification- \n\nStill NTA\n\n1. Finances are tighter than typical due to above and beyond travel to accommodate an emergency- a tragic emergency. But there you were, doing the right thing by your children and getting them there - don\u2019t know if it was a school night that night but wow that\u2019s a hard blow and school reasonably needs to be back burnered for a few days if only from the blow \n\n2. They\u2019ve already attended the funeral- asking a child to reopen the wound for a laid to rest mother so other family members can see (edit typo) their children\u2019s pain? (Edit to add:) Alone?????? No thanks \n\n3. Miss school for said second funeral? Errr\u2026. Yeah no \n\n4. Detriment to the children reliving it. \n\n5. Birthday my not so hairy ass. \n\nAnd on and on - you\u2019re right to protect your children from this distress especially as it lines up with their own desires. \n\nI have a feeling that if they felt the need to go you\u2019d make it happen somehow. \n\n\u201cWe\u201d are  welcome to have as many funerals as they want - everyone grieves their own way and I am so terribly sorry for your children and extended family\u2019s loss. But \u201cwe\u201d can\u2019t force others to dance to \u201cour\u201d tune for same reason\n\nSorry so long - stay strong dad", "WTH.  Can't you read?  It's not a funeral, it's a *birthday party*! /s\n\n(Seriously, who tries to pass off such a dumb lie?)", "Can you imagine the boys thinking they were going to a birthday party and instead ending up at a funeral?  It would have been devastating for them.  This just reinforces that MIL was using them as props because she clearly has no concern for the boys' feelings.", "Not overnight though. We don't know the details of how long nd why etc but a 13 yo should not be home alone at 2am and in charge of a 9 yo.", "Yeah I was in the 90s too, but this isn't the 90s and it was 2am. I wouldn't have left my kids at that age at 2am.", "Kids can literally babysit young children at that age. Where I live they get their babysitting course at 11. I have been babysitting for 2 years, every weekend at that age. And so did every single of my friends. At other peoples houses and yes, sometimes up to 3-4 am.\n\nMaybe you wouldnt do it and thats your choice, but its totally ok to have a 13yrs old babysit a 9yr old in their own home late at night.", "Well sorry to announce to you that each friday and saturday nights hundreds of 13yr old are actually paid to do it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Does \u201c2am Friday\u201d mean Saturday morning? Or is Thursday evening a big party time in MD?", "I left those details deliberately vague. This post wasn't intended to be about my ex, but rather her family's handling of the situation.", "Thank you for your discretion.", "Understandable. And I really wasn't meaning to throw shade on her memory. Just establishing a foundation on whether you should fully and legally block your sons from their mothers family completely should they so wish. Doesn't seem like they have the greatest impression of them, and from the hints gleaned I can make some guesses as to why. I like to come on here and yell \"divorce him\" and \"Go NC\" but I really don't do so blindly. I dig sometimes and I strive for nuance. Hug your boys, let them cry when they need to, and maybe make some hot chocolate and play board games for a few days. Never let them play Risk though, that game always ends in fist fights in my experience."]}
