My children (13M and 9M) were left home alone that night and were not in the vehicle. I travelled from IN to MD to pick them up and my ex-MIL was trying to rush a funeral. I had to drive back to IN so that my wife (34F) could keep an eye on my two step-children (15M and 12M.) Then I returned to MD the next day with my two children to attend their mom's funeral. It has been 3 months now and the ex-MIL is planning a 2nd funeral in NY in January (I'm assuming so that family members who couldn't travel for the MD funeral can have one.) Here's where it gets sticky:\n\nI have spoken to both of my sons and BOTH of them say they do not want to attend a 2nd funeral. SO the ex-MIL gets them on the phone and says \"It's not a funeral, it's a birthday party!\" I showed my boys her FB post stating that it was a funeral. She is manipulating my boys by saying things in a misleading way. I spoke with the Aunt (23F) and told her that the boys simply did not want to go and I'm not going to force them. And furthermore, after the expenditures I've taken on since October and just providing a Christmas for 4 boys, that it wasn't financially feasible to take another long trip at this time. Not to mention, it's in the middle of a school week for the boys! They said they would pay for the boys to come alone. The boys both said they would NOT be travelling without me.\n\nSoon after this revelation the Aunt exploded on me saying that it wasn't fair for HER that I won't budge on sending the kids alone and why do I have to be present when the boys visit! I asked her why it was fair that she is completely disregarding the wishes of the boys. She then screamed that she was going to take me to court. Well good luck, sister. For clarity, I have invited them ALL to come to Indiana to see them and have plans in the works to take a \"cousin tour\" this summer with the boys.

Also wouldn't be surprised if they don't want to go on the \"cousin tour\".\n\nWith something so terrible as the loss of their mother, these kids come first - way before what ex-MIL or ex-SIL want.", "NTA, it's sad enough to go to one funeral. The boys' wishes should be respected.", "NTA. Your boys are traumatized and obviously want no part of this. They attended the original funeral. Enough. Screw the ex MIL and aunt and all the relatives. They probably just want the boys there for show. And DO NOT send the boys alone with those people.  OMG. So sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\n\nThe boys said their goodbyes.  They shouldn't be traumatized by being forced to attend a memorial service for Mom's people in NY who couldn't make it to the funeral.  If they wanted to go, that would be another story - but they don't.  \n\nEx's family is disgusting by trying to ambush them just so they can trot them out in NY.  Ex SIL is also dumb as bricks.  She should be dripping honey at this point, because I'm assuming they all get to see the boys at your pleasure (as always, consult a family lawyer to make sure they can't actually do anything.  At least their Grandparents, particularly if they did alot of caretaking).  They need to keep you happy with them if they want a relationship - at least bide their time until they're both adults.", "NTA - good for you standing up for what they want. I lost an absent parent in my teens and remember more than anything how awkward I felt sharing that emotion in a group setting, and I barely knew him. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted a 2nd one either.", "NTA  \nHow could you be? You're *not* forcing grieving children to do something they do not want to do.", "I don\u2019t blame you for not making them go they already been through enough NTA", "Ya, the boys are old enough to decide. If they were younger, then maybe I think you should encourage it. But they are old enough to understand and don't want to go.\n\n NTA, way to stick up for the boys", "NTA. The boys don't want to go. Period. No other explanation needed. I don't understand the whole having to get back immediately for your wife to watch your step kids. What does that mean (not that it's really relevant I'm just nosey because it doesn't make sense to the story)?", "> End of discussion\n\n\u201cMy sons just lost their mother and want to grieve in private. They have no interest in being props for a second funeral.\u201d\n\nOP should keep on being a good and attentive dad who understands his sons\u2019 needs", "Cutting off access is too far. But agree NTA", "Please don\u2019t lump all us 23yo\u2019s with her we\u2019re not all that dumb \ud83d\ude02", "I'm so sorry about your mom. \n\nI feel you on the staring though. I felt it for both my sister's and my father's funerals. Particularly my sister's.\n\nFunerals aren't for the dead, they are for the living.\n\nOP, you are NTA. The boys are astute enough to realize they do not want to retraumatize themselves, even if they don't fully realize that's what they are avoiding. Some really slow baseline healing has already begun whether they feel it or not, to make them relive the grief and pain all over again with a 2nd funeral, is absolutely abhorrent. Good on you on recognizing it should be their cho and then supporting that choice.", "On the initial trip to MD we thought we would just be getting the boys and returning home, not knowing ex MIL would rush the funeral. The other 2 boys we left at home with my best friend not knowing we would need to be gone for a week.", "NTA! As someone who had to do two funerals for my aunt because of a hurricane preventing burial. This is hard on adults (which we all were) I don\u2019t think children should be forced to grieve in public to make mom\u2019s family happy because this is all for show and nothing else at this point. This is ridiculous to but the kids through.", "So someone who threatens to take you to court to force your minor children to go to their mother's second funeral that they absolutely do not want to go to, are the kind of people you think children should continue to be around? Okay then", "She has no grounds to sue. Contrary to popular opinion you can't just sue because you feel like it, although of course if you have enough money you can always find a lawyer who will waste your money making a big old song dance about it to scare the other side. \n\nI'd be more concerned the threat of court is around custody and grandparent rights. OP probably should make sure all is square on that front. I know shit all about grandparent rights but the two things I think I know, is not all states have them but some do, and they require a pre-existing relationship between the grandparents and children. It sounds like the latter is satisfied so OP may need to make sure there isn't a basis here for MIL to force through visitation and potentially force them to attend future events.", "But why didn\u2019t you just stay the night, or was the return trip to IN a few days after getting to MD?", "\ud83d\udc4d are the kids not your current wife's kids? Usually funerals are within a few days. Not that it matters. Do you. As long as the kids truthfully don't want to go then don't make them.", "They're in the wrong but you need to consider they've just lost a daughter/sister.\n\nPeople make shitty decisions when they're grieving. Those kids are the last remnant of their daughters/sister legacy. The last proof she existed.\n\nGive them time to grieve then re-establish contact.", "My understanding of GPR is the same as yours, but given all the lawyers / judges I've worked with in my life, no judge in his right mind would force a child to attend a funeral that they adamantly did not want to go to, as it would be against the best interests of the child.\n\nSome people need to just grow up!", "This, be sure your kids are safely and fully under your care.\n\nNTA, you actually sound kinda great. Keep up the good parenting.", "The whole ordeal took place over a week. My wife made the I itial trip with me and we left our other 2 sons home with my best friend not knowing that the ex MIL was going to rush a funeral. The trip in the middle was to get my wife home with the other 2 boys.", "They lost a sister/daughter but those kids lost their mother. They are not props to be called on when it suits their grieving especially not when they are actively manipulating them to try and get them to do what they want.", "They will be given time to grieve, the time between now and when the kids turn 18 is plenty of time to grieve....tragic events gives you an excuse to be an AH, it doesn't mean you are owed forgiveness", "No, but if GPR are granted it'll be nigh on impossible to stop her forcing them to attend events held on \"her\" time.", "In most cases GP Rights are limited to grandparents who have acted as primary caretakers for an extended period of time, right? Like, if the parents were unable or unwilling to care for the kids, so the grandparents had to step in. At least, that's how it is in my state.", "Well, mean or not, I suspect there is a reason OP specified that it was a single car accident at 2am on a Friday night. That reads like \"how can I say she was being negligent without using those words\". Otherwise why not just say she died in an accident?", "Ok that makes a lot more sense. I was going to say driving so much in just 2 days should excuse you. \n\nI mean honestly no matter what you should be excused from going. Your boys shouldn\u2019t have to go through another funeral.", "Absolutely agree. Hence my clear statement that the father is NTA. I'm just pointing out that, whilst the family are the assholes, there are mitigating circumstances right now often not understood by people who have never lost a child or sister.\n\nWhat everyone needs now is some time to heal. Then, at the appropriate time, it's in the best interest of all involved for the kids to have a happy relationship with their mother's family. \n\nWhen some time passes they are likely to understand that they made a bad call but, in the meantime, people need to realise that grief undercuts rational behaviour.\n\nAdult behaviour is to realise that, monitor the  situation and when things calm, reassess. Unfortunately, it's a reality that AITA immediately jumps to extreme responses.\n\nHonestly, I suspect the family will likely calm down after the funeral.", "5 years of isolation for family who are grieving.\n\nI'm sure that's in the best interest of two kids who just lost their mother.\n\nMaintain perspective.", "I haven\u2019t lost a sister or living child but I have lost the grandmother who practically raised me until I was 11 when she passed. Grief absolutely causes people to act irrationally but if someone for any reason thinks manipulating my daughter is ok I will cut them out of her life because manipulation is never the answer. If they hadn\u2019t tried to use abusive tactics to get there way it would be a different story. Does it have to be the full 5 years? No, but that\u2019s the max length of time that OP has control over the relationship which is why I would have said it though I can\u2019t speak for the original person who said it", "I love how you said family when its a singular entitled aunt .\n\nAnd I would say that the best interest of children who just lost one parent is to not be around someone who is threatening to take them from their remaining parent. \n\nMaintain perspective.", "The family who threats their only parent to take him to court. Grow up. They are dangerous.", "The mother in law is also specifically referenced in the post.\n\nThere's no suggestion in the post that the aunt is threatening to take the child away from the parent. You've made that up. It's just an unspecified threat to take them to court made in the heat of the moment. It may be as simple as a naive belief that a judge will make them go to the funeral.\n\nI would agree with you that it's not in the best interest of the children to be around the grieving mother and aunt right now and I agree the father is NTA.\n \nWhen you start advocating for removing access for 5 years, when even the father wants to do no such thing, is where you've lost the plot.\n\nI'm out. Downvote as you will.", "Dangerous? Yeah you need to maintain perspective as well.", "Ex-MIL tried to manipulate OPs kids to go to the funeral by lying to them. Then OP was threatened with court battle over not forcing his kids to go there. If they are already coming up with this kind of crap it's hard to imagine what they will do next. They seem unstable no matter if they are grieving or not."]}
