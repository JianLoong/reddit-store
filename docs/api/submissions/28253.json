No.  No other adult needs his blessing to make their own decisions, not you, me, or any other woman, and if that bruises his ego, that's on him.\n\nHeck, I'm very close to my dad, he's the first person I run nearly all my major decisions by because I value his input, and I STILL told my fiance not to ask for his blessing before proposing.

My wife was not big on this either, but when we started getting serious I think we both kinda decided that doing some traditional stuff was not horrible.\n\nOne thing for all the people saying that this is archaic.  That may be true, but asking a woman's father's blessing is also kinda a route to understanding if you are about to make an ass of yourself.", "NAH - I know that this will probably be seen as controversial since the history of asking for one's daughter's hand in marriage is a sexist tradition. The thing is that there is a reason that this tradition hasn't died when it's felt dated for well over 50 years, if not longer.\n\nThe point of asking the parents (not just the father) for permission to marry is because it shows understanding that asking someone to marry you is also asking to join their family. Presumably, the person proposing has already asked their parents for their blessing, and asking the other party's parents is essentially respectfully acknowledging that you are imposing yourself on their family.\n\nThey don't owe you and your finance their permission for you to marry, and you sure as hell don't need it to get married. So I do feel that this is about showing respect.", "YTA. You're your own person, not an object to be given away.", "**NAH**.\n\nThis is just about different generations having different outlook of things.\n\nYour parents are NA for wanting him to ask for their blessing; as that is just a formality that shows them that your fianc\u00e9 is brave enough to stand up and show his face against authority for you.\n\nAnd you are NA for not agreeing that a blessing is necessary.\n\nBut you are an AH for mentioning the \"he did nothing to help\" when your boyfriend was homeless and then mentioning that you didn't really expect him to help.
