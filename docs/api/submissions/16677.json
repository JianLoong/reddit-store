She's lost her hair and wears a wig, and is never seen without it. \n\nSince her cancer diagnosis Ella has unfortunately become quite nasty. I understand she's scared and probably very angry about how her life has turned out, but she absolutely terrorises her cousins, particularly my 7 year old, \"Hayley\". We should've put a stop to this a long time ago, but it's hard to tell off a sick child and not look like the bad guy. \n\nThe kids were playing outside when we heard someone crying. Ella had dared Hayley to lick a muddy puddle, and gotten the rest of the kids to demand she did it. They were all egging her on and Ella had my sister's phone and was filming it. When the adults came outside I took Hayley and made clear she didn't have to do anything, and that this \"game\" stopped immediately. \n\nElla still had the phone and was filming us, and said \"maybe we'll make her do it later.\" Hayley was crying her eyes out. She let go of me, ran up to Ella, pulled her wig off and threw it into the puddle. Ella started screaming and ran to her parents. She was hyperventilating and screaming for her parents to stop everyone looking at her. \n\nThey took Ella into a room to calm her down, but my parents went mad at Hayley, saying taking Ella's wig off was a \"disgusting thing to do\". They said Hayley has \"no idea what Ella has to face every day\" (my dad has also survived cancer so this is quite personal to him). \n\nElla's parents came out and said their daughter doesn't want anyone to see her. They said Ella is \"traumatised\" by everyone seeing her without her hair. My sister called Hayley a \"horrible child\" and that \"only an evil person\" would think about taking a little girl with cancer's wig. \n\nI defended Hayley and said that Ella and the others were clearly bullying and tormenting her, but my sister said it's not her or her daughter's problem if Hayley can't handle \"girly teasing\". \n\nMy parents and my sister/BIL \"agreed\" that they want a written apology from Hayley to Ella, one which \"shows that she understands what a cruel thing she did\". I said that was not going to happen. \n\nWe left with Hayley but I'm still seething. I'm truly sorry that Ella is having to go through cancer. But she was tormenting my daughter, ganging up on her and filming the whole thing.

Also that you aren't mad at her. Then sit down and have a bowl of ice cream or a treat like that together and talk about her feelings and ways to deal with these situations. Also tell your parents that you are upset they aren't also defending your daughter who was being bullied and humiliated and it was being filmed to put on the internet so she'd get even more bullied. And then say if you aren't going to also realize she was hurt first and only reacted the only way a 7 yr old could think of then perhaps they needed a break from seeing all of you. One of my oncology appointments we had to sit in the area where people were getting IV chemotherapy. There was a mom with w kids in there, one of the kids was getting the chemo. We could clearly overhear them and she was making the younger child feel so awful I wanted to cry. She made him hold the bowl the other kid was throwing up into because (insert kid's name wants you to hold it so he feels better. Even the nurses were trying to intervene and take the bowl to hold and mom kept insisting it was brother's job that he always does to not be a bad boy. Also younger brother had to also help older brother at home after chemo with vomiting. And do his chores until he felt better, which the younger boy actually got some backbone and said so forever then because he never feels better enough to do them. (I wanted to applaud). And they discussed the treat they'd go get after chemo which older brother got to pick like always  (this I kind of agree with tbh). And little brother wanted to know why he couldn't pick dinner since older brother wouldn't feel good enough to eat it anyway which seemed reasonable and mom went off. Badly enough that I'm sure the people on the other side of the  building could hear her. I get she was under a lot of stress but the other kids needs and wants are also important and shouldn't be ignored nor should he have ever been put in charge of emesis containers and all the chores. Having a kid with cancer is scary. Having cancer is terrifying. My husband is constantly worried about mine and the effects my chemo is having on me, I have leukemia and take a daily chemo pill so not as difficult all at once as the IV chemo but it is every day no breaks with tons of the same side effects just slightly less severe. So very long story but keep standing up for your daughter. Having cancer as a kid doesn't mean they get to be complete bullies and jerks. Occasionally being overwhelmed and having a tantrum or anxiety attack absolutely but not bullying younger children.

We should've put a stop to this a long time ago, but it's hard to tell off a sick child and not look like the bad guy. \n\nYou have turned a blind eye to your 7 year old daughter being bullied by her cousin, who is two years older than her, because you didn't want to look like the \"bad guy\".  \n\n>Hayley was crying her eyes out. She let go of me, ran up to Ella, pulled her wig off and threw it into the puddle\n\nYour daughter was so fed up of being bullied and picked on, with no one defending her, protecting her, or standing up for her, as a *7 year old*, that she *did it herself* the only way she could in that moment.  \n\n>They took Ella into a room to calm her down, but my parents went mad at Hayley, saying taking Ella's wig off was a \"disgusting thing to do\". They said Hayley has \"no idea what Ella has to face every day\" (my dad has also survived cancer so this is quite personal to him). \n\nShe then, after *defending herself, at age 7*, was *punished verbally* by her *grandparents*. What did you do while your daughter was berated by your parents for trying to stand up for herself? \n\n>I defended Hayley and said that Ella and the others were clearly bullying and tormenting her, but my sister said it's not her or her daughter's problem if Hayley can't handle \"girly teasing\". \n\nWhat's good for the goose is good for the gander. If what she was doing (whilst she has cancer) was \"girly teasing\", then what she got in return (whilst she has cancer) is also \"girly teasing\". Her illness does not give her immunity from consequences.  \n\n>My parents and my sister/BIL \"agreed\" that they want a written apology from Hayley to Ella, one which \"shows that she understands what a cruel thing she did\". I said that was not going to happen. \n\nYour parents, sister and BIL can lick a puddle.  \n\n>We left with Hayley but I'm still seething. I'm truly sorry that Ella is having to go through cancer. But she was tormenting my daughter, ganging up on her and filming the whole thing. Hayley obviously shouldn't have taken the wig, but she was very upset and being bullied.  \n\nThe person you owe an apology to here is *your daughter*. You should have never allowed her to be bullied, let alone for *two fucking years*.  \nIt got so bad that your child, who is 7, had to take things into her own hands to try and protect herself and get the harrassment to stop.  \nOP, I mean this with the most kindness I can, that's *heartbreaking*. Your daughter has seen you ignore her being mistreated for two years. She didn't trust you to protect her, and why should she?  \n\n>Ella still had the phone and was filming us, and said \"maybe we'll make her do it later.\"\n\nEven Ella knows she can continue to bully your child the second you turn away. She even said it *in front of you*. That's why your daughter threw her wig in the puddle. She knew you, her mother, weren't going to protect her. So she had to try and make it stop herself.  \n\nAs for the bullying itself- teasing and being mean is one thing. \"Daring\" another child, especially a *younger* child to do something gross and humiliating, is another. It's then another thing entirely when that behaviour escalates into pressure and demanding that younger child to perform the act- including recruiting other children to partake in the taunting and pressuring of that child. Adding to that, the filming of that child doing the humiliating and gross act under duress is the cherry on this shit sundae.  \nYour child is *not safe* around these children. Your child *has not been safe* around these children for a long time.  \n\nStep up and be a mother to your daughter, OP. Protect her. Stop playing happy family, because this is not a happy family. This is a family that is letting your daughter be humiliated and pressured into doing something she isn't comfortable with, and that could hurt her. Want to know what other kinds of situations are similar?  \nOnes that are illegal and are often called *abuse*.  \nSo stop teaching your daughter that she doesn't matter, that her safety doesn't matter, and that if someone has a bad thing going on in their life, they can abuse her. Because that *is* what you're teaching her. And she *will* learn from this.  \n\nYour sister is potentially robbing her daughter of life just as much as the cancer is. She is teaching her daughter that her illness means she has no consequences, requires no responsibility or reflection on her actions, and can treat others without regard. She is stealing her daughter's chance to grow into a balanced, emotionally healthy individual, likely out of the intense fear of losing her daughter to cancer.  \nThis child isn't happy. This child is limitless, without boundaries, isn't being supported or guided- she is being provided anything and everything she wants, and is being treated as if made of glass. It undermines her strength, it denies her opportunities to grow and learn, and will mean that if she goes into remission, she will have to work relentlessly to undo the immense amount of awful values her parents instilled in her at a young age.  \n\nDon't let your daughter be exposed to her abusers again. Protect her. And apologise to her, explain why you are sorry, and tell her what you will do differently so that you will protect her in future.  \n\nESH but these kids.", "NTA she got what she deserved and honestly I would tell your sister and parents to have a look at that horrible video that your niece took and then take a long hard think about who owes who an apology. \n\nNext time you see them make it very clear that your child won\u2019t be apologising nor will she be allowed to play with their horrible daughter.

Hayley needs to know that first and foremost you support her and that just because going forward you'd like to see her practice handling things a little differently if she can, doesn't mean that girl gets an apology", "Cancer or not, Ella is a fucking dick.

You're NTA and thank you for standing up for your kid who clearly was standing up for themselves.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry your niece has cancer but that doesn\u2019t give her a free pass to bully and insult other people. I\u2019m sure her parents and your parents are not disciplining her because she has cancer but they aren\u2019t doing her any favors.  If she goes into remission, having no structure and rules will make for a horrible teenager. Your child is 7, and while throwing her cousin\u2019s wig in the puddle wasn\u2019t nice, it seems like a totally age appropriate response to someone who was tormenting her. Ella needs to apologize as well.", "NTA. Obviously it was wrong, but demanding that your daughter apologizes while making excuses for the cousin is incredibly wrong. I would demand that your sister send you the video. It sounds like everyone needs a reality check.", "Congrats. Ella is technically a violent coercive  child.  What she did is abuse. I imagine her being a violent offender as an adult. She\u2019s already starting and filming it. \n\nIf this was done amongst adults, charges would be laid against her.\n\nShe\u2019s fucking disgusting. I\u2019d cut ties with the entire family after she tried to make my child sick and publicly humiliated. And then was enabled by all the abusive disgusting adults around her. \n\nElla is deranged. So is the rest of your family. \n\nElla is sick in the head. Cancer is the least of your families worries. Especially with enabling parents like hers.\n\nElla displays sociopathic qualities.

I get that she is ill, but she was bullying your daughter to tears, and threatened to continue when you were \u201cnot around\u201d essentially, which is pretty nasty behavior.  It is so tricky when kids are sick, we tend to let them slide on basic stuff out of guilt.  But if she is well enough to,bully a child younger than her, she is well enough to understand that she brought the reaction upon herself and that it is never okay to bully anyone, especially if they are younger or more vulnerable than you.  The bully needs to apologize to your daughter, and to you, for disrespecting an adult trying to end the bullying by saying she would do it later. My guess, if the apology is sincere, your daughter would likely apologize for taking her wig, but she doesn\u2019t have to, but it could be nice. But the bully needs to apologize first.  I volunteered at Children\u2019s Hospital in LA, and rarely did I work with sick or dying kids that were lashing out, but most families were in therapy too. I would suggest they get some family therapy, as the child is lashing out and getting away with it, so essentially she is being told that the bad behavior is an acceptable form of coping, when in fact there are other ways that are healthier for everyone. And the parents need therapy too, this is incredibly difficult for the, they have no control and likely feel guilty, but letting their daughter harm others, is not an acceptable coping mechanism nor is is acceptable.", "NTA. Stand firm. Ella is not just a bully by but also a cyberbully, apparently.\n\nIt's a shame what Ella's going through, but it's no excuse for mistreating other people.

A former acquaintance of mine had cancer as a child. She was never told no, never taught to share, never disciplined because her mother had that \"don't discipline a sick kid\" mentality.\n\nLet me tell you that as an adult she is now friendless with not even her family wanting anything to do with her. She is physically and verbally abusive, especially towards strangers. She throws screeching temper tantrums if things aren't 100% as she demands. She has absolutely no self-awareness as to why everybody hates her and she genuinely believes that she is the victim, even in incidents she instigates. \n\nThis could easily be the future for \"Ella\" and her parents need a wake-up call.

I've gone through similar stuff as Hayley when I was a kid, imagine lick a dusty ping pong table instead of puddle.

Let her understand that she does have a hand in shaping the world around her, and she shaped this event, but she shaped it in a cruel way that snapped back and hurt her. That power was in her hands, and it will keep being in her hands: she can make her own life measurably better if she chooses better.", "The worst part about this to me (besides a child having cancer ofc) is how you OP kept bringing your kid. Considering how your family we\u2019re probably all bullies when they were younger they would definitely make you the bad guy for setting a boundary with Ella. But you still fucked up by putting your CHILD in that situation over and over again. \nThere were so many other things you could have done if you weren\u2019t worried about your image so much. Coming from someone with a mother who cared about what people thought over my safety and well being many times, it fucks with you. It\u2019s heartbreaking.  It causes A LOT of resentment. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to tell off a sick child and not look like the bad guy\u201d this is what I\u2019m basing this off of. You\u2019re playing into \u201ca sick child can do no wrong\u201d bs and all too worried about looking like a bad guy. You shouldn\u2019t worry about looking like a dick if your kid is in pain.\nYour child was in danger every time you let her cousin near her, not just physically, but the intense trauma your daughter is now gonna have to deal with for the rest of her life?? People think trauma when you\u2019re a kid doesn\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s the complete opposite. Borderline personality disorder, dissociative identity disorder, sociopathy are all mental illnesses that you develop from early and continuous childhood trauma. You need to apologize to your kid for the rest of her life, you failed her. Familial trauma is in my opinion one of the worst, it hits you the deepest and hardest. I hope she gets the support she deserves and needs now.\n\nYou are her family, family is the one group of people who are supposed to stand by you and protect you against the whole world. And no one protected her until now. Good on your for FINALLY getting your kid out of that horrible situation.\n\nNo you\u2019re not the asshole for not making Hayley apologize to the horribly raised child, but you are for being one of the reasons it went on for so long.", "Even IF such a thing as \u201egirly teasing\u201c existed, how comes humiliating someone is girly teasing but snatching a wig is not girly teasing? Like WHERE does OPs sister draw the line? At anything directed at her own daughter bc she has cancer? \n\nThey gotta sit ella down with a therapist and explain to her that her anger might be valid but she cant act out on innocent people.\n\nNTA, all the way.", "If that's just \"teasing\" then so was pulling off the wig.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not me or my daughters problem if Ella can\u2019t handle being bald\u201d", "Sounds like Ella fucked around and found out. Having cancer isn't an excuse to torment other children.", "Not only that, but Hayley only threw the wig in the puddle after Ella literally threatened in front of everyone to make her lick the puddle later!!! NTA NTA NTA!!!", "So now all the adults want Hayley to lick the mud and make Ella happy.", "Tell her it was just some harmless girly teasing as well. Why does she and her daughter get to be the gatekeepers of \"teasing\" if it's so harmless? Next time, Hailey can tease her directly by her standards.  NTA", "I bet their excuse is that they won\u2019t be parenting for long so why impose limits.\n\nWhich is a pretty morbid way to approach it. Like this little girl\u2019s life is a whole \u201cMake a Wish\u201d day.", "That would definitely teach Hayley a lesson to not stand up to the bullies. Way to go. This is no different from school principal making kids apologize to their bullies. And y'all wonder why bullying is so prevalent", "Hayley didn't do anything wrong. Ella is the one in the wrong. I don't care if she has cancer. Also the sister should stop medical expenses for Ella and let her go because there is no fixing a walking tumor.", "SERIOUSLY?!?  Are you kidding me?\n\nA 7 year old child who has been bullied and tormented for who knows how long (weeks? months?) is NOT a \"little monster\" for making a final stand against her bully.  What she did wasn't the right thing to do, but does NOT make her a monster.\n\nElla needs help. Even if she is only 9 yrs old; and especially since she is so young.  She needs to understand that being bald is not as bad as she is making it.  She needs her doctors and her family and possibly other cancer victims to help her understand that it sucks but she can choose to grow stronger through it OR she can grow weaker and meaner through it.  At this point, she and her family are choosing the latter.", "Having cancer and being a horrible human have nothing to do with one another. That child needs help but sadly she likely wont live long enough to actually get the help she needs.", "Because Ella has cancer, so she can only be a victim. /s\n\nSarcasm from me, but I do think this is probably her parents\u2019 and the grandparents\u2019 mindset. No, of course it isn\u2019t fair that she has to face cancer at such a young age, but that does not exempt her from being a decent person or facing consequences for her actions.", "\u201cGirly teasing\u201d is literally the worst to me as a woman and a teacher. It\u2019s insidious and people just brush it off because \u201cit\u2019s not that bad, it\u2019s not like the kid is physically hurt\u201d. No they aren\u2019t physically hurt at the moment but the things girls say or do to one another and others\u2026it\u2019s awful and it cuts deeply and often irreversibly. I know quite a few women my age (30s) who engaged or still engage in things that ultimately only hurt themselves (drugs, promiscuity as a way to try and feel better about themselves, things that result in physical scars, alcoholism, etc.) because of \u201cgirly teasing\u201d. I know a few others who are no longer with us because of years of \u201cgirly teasing\u201d that they felt like there was nothing else they could do. I shut it down when I see it or hear it in my classroom, the lunchroom, in the halls, wherever when I\u2019m teaching because I refuse to allow it. I\u2019ve been told by parents and a few other (usually older but not always) teachers that it\u2019s harmless and it helps \u201ctoughen them up\u201d.", "I love this! Honestly, who wouldn\u2019t rather have their hair get in a muddy puddle rather than their tongue? Obviously I understand it was traumatic and would be horrible in different circumstances, but I think it was deserved in this one.", "Oof, nothing quite like a Strongly Worded Letter.", "I was 9 in 1987. So I feel like a fossil.", "I can't believe I'm completely ok with being awful to a child with cancer. However, her parents are not helping her, the fact she was filming bullying her little cousin showed intention of deliberate humiliation, yeah I'm ok with it.", "Oh yeah I mean her parents definitely suck the most.  I get that they're probably scared and desperate and don't want to yell at their kid when she misbehaves, because who wants to yell at a little girl with cancer?  \n\nBut they're letting their (understandable) coddling and indulgence lead to behavior which harms other kids, and that's the point at which it becomes unacceptable.", "\u261d\ufe0f This is important.  An adult stepped in and said \"No. Stop.\"\n\nThe bully essentially said \"We'll wait until you are not here to protect her. THEN we'll do it.\"", "It really should.  Having cancer shouldn't be Ella's identity. Being a nice kid who unfortunately has cancer should be.", "I'm having a Mama Bear moment on your behalf! I would have *ripped that school and district a new one* if a school had done that to my kid! GRRR!"]}
