She's lost her hair and wears a wig, and is never seen without it. \n\nSince her cancer diagnosis Ella has unfortunately become quite nasty. I understand she's scared and probably very angry about how her life has turned out, but she absolutely terrorises her cousins, particularly my 7 year old, \"Hayley\". We should've put a stop to this a long time ago, but it's hard to tell off a sick child and not look like the bad guy. \n\nThe kids were playing outside when we heard someone crying. Ella had dared Hayley to lick a muddy puddle, and gotten the rest of the kids to demand she did it. They were all egging her on and Ella had my sister's phone and was filming it. When the adults came outside I took Hayley and made clear she didn't have to do anything, and that this \"game\" stopped immediately. \n\nElla still had the phone and was filming us, and said \"maybe we'll make her do it later.\" Hayley was crying her eyes out. She let go of me, ran up to Ella, pulled her wig off and threw it into the puddle. Ella started screaming and ran to her parents. She was hyperventilating and screaming for her parents to stop everyone looking at her. \n\nThey took Ella into a room to calm her down, but my parents went mad at Hayley, saying taking Ella's wig off was a \"disgusting thing to do\". They said Hayley has \"no idea what Ella has to face every day\" (my dad has also survived cancer so this is quite personal to him). \n\nElla's parents came out and said their daughter doesn't want anyone to see her. They said Ella is \"traumatised\" by everyone seeing her without her hair. My sister called Hayley a \"horrible child\" and that \"only an evil person\" would think about taking a little girl with cancer's wig. \n\nI defended Hayley and said that Ella and the others were clearly bullying and tormenting her, but my sister said it's not her or her daughter's problem if Hayley can't handle \"girly teasing\". \n\nMy parents and my sister/BIL \"agreed\" that they want a written apology from Hayley to Ella, one which \"shows that she understands what a cruel thing she did\". I said that was not going to happen. \n\nWe left with Hayley but I'm still seething. I'm truly sorry that Ella is having to go through cancer. But she was tormenting my daughter, ganging up on her and filming the whole thing. Hayley obviously shouldn't have taken the wig, but she was very upset and being bullied.", "created_utc": 1683532368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bhvtl/aita_for_not_making_my_daughter_apologise_for/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was threatening to force a child who is younger than her into doing something as disgusting as that while also constantly acting out towards her for no reason. It was completely fair that your daughter did that to her. Karma\u2019s a bitch.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter was being bullied and harassed by her cousin and her friends. Ella's behavior is unacceptable, and it's understandable that Hayley would react in such a way after being subjected to such cruelty. It's also not fair for your family to demand an apology from Hayley when she was clearly the victim in this situation. It's important to address the bullying behavior of Ella and her friends rather than blaming the victim. I hope that your family can work towards a solution that ensures the safety and well-being of all the children involved.", "NTA\n\nF*ck them and their shitty parenting. Having any illness goes not give you an automatic right to treat others like sh*t. You did the right thing.\n\nTell them Hayley isn't apologising until Ella apologises for being a bully. Simple as that. \n\nIf they stick by Ella then they've made their loyalties clear and I would remove them from your life. Your daughter will always play second fiddle to the golden child so there is no point competing.

This is not \"girly teasing\" and I'm guessing I know where the attitude towards others comes from.", "NTA\n\nCancer is not an excuse for not parenting.", "NTA. while i agree that it wasn\u2019t nice of hayley to grab the wig, she\u2019s a child who was defending herself. it seems like your parents and ella\u2019s parents are letting her get away with everything because she has cancer, which is not healthy. children who grow up without boundaries or consequences for their actions usually grow into entitled, selfish adults. just because she has cancer, that doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t be held responsible when misbehaving", "NTA. This was all caught on camera and they're saying your kid, who was being bullied and forced into doing something she didn't want to do, is the one at fault? Cut contact and give the exact reasoning why you cut contact because if they're going to do this level of bs, they're only going to make it so that if the cousin survives, she thinks she deserves anything she wants and will continue hurting your kid.", "No contact. No excuses, no explanations, no replies. \n\nOnly an evil person would think about excusing tormenting a child as \"girly teasing.\"\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA - she was a 7 year old getting bullied, she didn't react in the best of ways so maybe she should apologize. But, the parents of the bully should suggest to apologize first since the bully was overwhelmingly at fault.", "NTA. Your sister and BIL are (understandably) overprotective of Ella due to her cancer diagnosis, but it's gone beyond reason and is now impacting your daughter. \"But she has cancer\" is not a justification for horrible behavior, and the longer they continue to allow Ella free reign, the more twisted she'll grow up to become (as harsh as that sounds). As Hayley's father, you have a duty and an obligation to protect her\u2014regardless of the personal circumstances of the people hurting her.\n\nThink of things this way: how badly would you regret it if you allowed this continue, and as a result, your daughter got seriously hurt? Could you look her in the eye and say \"but Ella has cancer\" as a reason to justify inaction on your part?", "Let\u2019s talk about the fact this kid wanted to post your daughters humiliation online ? Nta", "NTA, tell the adults that you would apologise if all of them film themselves licking a muddy puddle and posting the video on social media.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is definitely not the one in the wrong here. I don\u2019t doubt Ella was traumatized because everyone saw her without her hair but actions have consequences unfortunately.", "NTA, I understand why your parents and sister/BIL are siding with Ella. She must be traumatized, but Ella needed to be taught a lesson, Have your family sit down and have a talk about Ella's behaviour. Please don't cave and enable this behaviour.", "OP, bad situation all the way around. \n\nShould she have pulled the wig off - NO. But one can understand the frustration level when no one makes it stop. Your daughter solved the situation albeit in a cruel manner. \n\nElla has become a cruel child in her own right, and a bully to boot. She has been given a terrible burden; full of pain, humiliation, fear, and the resulting anger. It does Not absolve her actions. \n\nAdults that did Not curtail this abusive behavior are ALL anal orifices. PERIOD. Don\u2019t play your cancer card grandpa. Don\u2019t play \u201cMy kid is sick so they can act with impunity.\u201d \n\nSomeone is going to have to be the bigger person. YOUR PARENTS should either remain neutral or BUTT OUT. Maybe y\u2019all can take a breath and come back together with cooler heads. \n\nIF I wrote a letter, big if here, it would be one of explanation of the situation, the escalation, and the aftermath. I might offer up alternate, APPROPRIATE, solutions to pulling off her wig. I believe that apologies are needed in both directions. \n\nBUT I do not agree with a child being a victim either. EVER. ( even in school, get hit?, hit back twice as hard - take the suspension. I stand by this , vote me down all you want - victim no more! That does not mean I believe in hitting, especially in hitting first, but in defense, yes.)\n\nEDIT: NTA times 1 billion - go mom!", "NTA. The apologies need to go both ways, Ella\u2019s parents and yours aren\u2019t doing her any favors by letting her pull the cancer card as an excuse for her behavior. If Ella\u2019s well enough to play - and behave like a bully- then she\u2019s well enough to learn the same lessons about kindness that other kids her age know. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound hard-hearted- it is excruciating to see your child suffer and to live daily with the fact that they might die. Our child had cancer, and I didn\u2019t breathe a full breath several months after chemo was over. It was devastating for our entire family. They weren\u2019t well enough to play while undergoing treatment, but we did expect them to treat others with decency and kindness. We didn\u2019t want to end up with a child that no one could tolerate if/when they recovered. I\u2019m very sorry you\u2019re all going through this, OP.", "NTA but no one looks good here.\nIt's a difficult situation with multiple factors to consider, but taking Ella's wig off was not an appropriate response, so in that sense, yes, Hayley's actions were wrong. However, Ella was bullying and tormenting Hayley, so it's not a clear-cut situation of one person being completely at fault. It's important to address the bullying and find a solution that is fair to everyone involved.", "NTA parents should nip it in the bud, yes your daughter probably shouldn\u2019t have done that. But, after the relentless teasing I see this as a justified last ditch effort to get Ella off her and I say that your daughter doesn\u2019t owe Ella any type of apology. Although to smoothen family relations maybe see if your sister are willing to do a thing where they both apologise to each other, but Ella have to offer the first apology", "NTA as a sister of a cancer victim, her parents are too lenient all \"bc she has cancer\" that is not doing Ella any good. Her Harrassing Hailey was traumatizing as well bc she was filming it.\n\nTo me there is no need to apologize for \"traumatizing\" it wouldn't have happened in the first place if Ella would have known how to behave. So it is actually your sister and her hb who are in the wrong !", "ohhh poor bully got to eat shit for once. sooooo sorry. sick or not has nothing to do with this.\n\nNTA", "ESH.\n\nY'all are terrible parents.\n\nYour sister is raising a bully with the cancer excuse.\n\nYou're letting your kid be bullied with the cancer excuse.\n\nYou all need to do better by your kids.", "NTA the only way your daughter stops being tortured is no contact. Block all of their numbers and move on.", "NTA\n\nThis wasn\u2019t \u2018girly teasing\u2019. That was happily trying to force/intimidate another child to do something humiliating and gross. What\u2019s particularly creepy is that she brought out a phone to film it (?) and had gotten the other kids involved. \n\nI can understand wanting to give your sick child everything you can to make the process easier but unfortunately in this case, your sister has raised a cruel and toxic bully.", "NTA for not making her apologize but YWBTA if you dont stop making Haley hang out with her cousin who bullies her. You admit she's been terrorizing Haley for a while now, why the hell have you been repeatedly subjecting your daughter to this? Its time to protect you daughter.", "having a cancer isn't an excuse for bullying nta and that kid got to learn how to behave \n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour dad using the cancer card isn't good either , i got it too and would never accept those kind of behavior she is a little bully", "NTA but your whole family is, especially the adults. It's true that Hayley wouldn't understand what Ella is going through, but she doesn't have to - she's only seven.\n\nWhat's disgusting is your parents turning a blind eye to Ella's cruel behavior, and turning against Hayley when she rightfully (yes, rightfully) retaliated.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s quite possible to tell off a sick child without being the bad guy. Their illness doesn\u2019t have anything to do with their choices in how they interact with other people. Your daughter retaliated against a bully: she\u2019s not in the wrong here. The irony that Ella wanted everyone to stop looking at her while trying to film your daughter humiliating herself cannot be understated. All of the \u201chorrible child\u201d, \u201cevil person\u201d, \u201cunderstands the cruel things she did\u201d can be quite accurately pointed in Ella\u2019s direction too.\n\nYou and your daughter don\u2019t need to apologise, but I think you do need to have a frank conversation about how Ella\u2019s illness has made her parents spoil her until she\u2019s a horrible bully. I\u2019d go low contact or no contact with them for a while, frankly. You and your daughter deserve better.", "ESH. I don\u2019t give a damn who started it and who finished it. \n\nTheir child is not being parented and needs discipline, cancer or not.\n\nParents for not parenting.\n\nGoing after the wig was a step too far and obviously she has trauma surrounding it, especially seeing it thrown in the puddle.\n\nThe clear solution is don\u2019t let your daughter around them until there\u2019s an actual change, and talk to your daughter about appropriate steps to take when being bullied, because she shouldn\u2019t stoop down to their level.", "ESH You know the bullying was going on for a long time, but you weren't going to stop allowing your daughter around the bully until now.  Your daughter being bullied is ok, until she blows up and get built wants an apology? Your daughter reached because she is out in this situation by you. Use their demand for an apology as a reason not to go back to family functions. Isn't this your chance to keep your daughter safe?", "ESH indeed, you should have put a stop to it a long time ago, so you're a bit of an a-hole yourself to let your daughter being bullied because you don't \"want to be the bad guy\".\n\nAnd all the other are a-hole obviously. Letting their daughter/grand-daughter being that awful to others is disgusting, pulling the cancer card like it's some sort of free pass to everything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My son was diagnosed with brain cancer  back on January, and you are right, kids can get a little nasty while dealing with all the changes in their body do to treatment and the illness itself, and its understandable but everything has a limit, my son started being mean to his sister, but it was my job to make him stop and make him understand that its not his sisters fault that he is sick.  i had to do my job as parent to dont invalidate my sons feelings but also to make sure he knows whats right and whats not. \n\ni also dont think your sister is an AH, i can see and some what understand why she is acting the way she is, which is not ok but i can understand what she is going through. \never since the day she found out about her daughter's diagnosed she lives with a fear that one day she might wake up and her little girl might not be there anymore. \nalso the lack of sleep; she is going through something really hard, because this unfortunate event in her daughters life has made a huge impact in her. seeing her daughter loose appetite, her hair, its harder on us a moms, than you can actually imagine. \ni can tell you that its really painful to see how your child is loosing his/her hair. \nmy son had beautiful curly hair, he has an afro, and seeing him loose his hair was really traumatic and painful. \ni can only imagine how she felt when her daughter lost her hair. \nlet me make clear that i dont justify her actions or way of reacting, but i do understand what she is going through.", "NTA - This may not be the best analogy but it's what came to mind.

If your parents and Ella's parents can't see this, I'm sorry, but they will suffer the consequences later on from the monster they are creating if Ella survives the cancer, which I hope she beats the cancer.

My cousins were clear from the get go, no one can say anything to their daughter and ignore her tantrums and basically give in to her every whim. BUT when things would get out of hand obviously no other parents were going to take this behaviour so obviously they were upset but learnt to deal with it. \n\nThe kids will most likely be playing together again next time you meet up but the adults will be still be seething. Cause that's the thing with kids they fight yet they are able to move on from it easily. So have the adults talk it out in a mature fashion. Say you understand your sister and Ella are going through a tough time but you as a parent can not allow such bullying to happen again. You'll have Hayley apologise for her actions but Ella will have to apologise as well for bullying her. If they still feel Ella deserves to be coddled this way and not have to answer for her actions, it would be best the kids don't hang out together again. \n\nDon't go NC when someone is terminally ill or going through cancer in your family. It's a tough time, stress and tension makes the AH sides of people just burst out but you'll honestly regret it later. From experience things do get better with time but you don't want to be the aunt or sister who went NC when their neice was extremely sick. Just saying.", "Honestly, this should be too comment. OP is def an AH for allowing the shitty behavior to continue and her sister is an AH for raising a bully and hiding behind an excuse. \n\nSeriously, who knowingly let\u2019s their child be bullied cancer or not."]}
