She's lost her hair and wears a wig, and is never seen without it. \n\nSince her cancer diagnosis Ella has unfortunately become quite nasty. I understand she's scared and probably very angry about how her life has turned out, but she absolutely terrorises her cousins, particularly my 7 year old, \"Hayley\". We should've put a stop to this a long time ago, but it's hard to tell off a sick child and not look like the bad guy. \n\nThe kids were playing outside when we heard someone crying. Ella had dared Hayley to lick a muddy puddle, and gotten the rest of the kids to demand she did it. They were all egging her on and Ella had my sister's phone and was filming it. When the adults came outside I took Hayley and made clear she didn't have to do anything, and that this \"game\" stopped immediately. \n\nElla still had the phone and was filming us, and said \"maybe we'll make her do it later.\" Hayley was crying her eyes out. She let go of me, ran up to Ella, pulled her wig off and threw it into the puddle. Ella started screaming and ran to her parents. She was hyperventilating and screaming for her parents to stop everyone looking at her. \n\nThey took Ella into a room to calm her down, but my parents went mad at Hayley, saying taking Ella's wig off was a \"disgusting thing to do\". They said Hayley has \"no idea what Ella has to face every day\" (my dad has also survived cancer so this is quite personal to him). \n\nElla's parents came out and said their daughter doesn't want anyone to see her. They said Ella is \"traumatised\" by everyone seeing her without her hair. My sister called Hayley a \"horrible child\" and that \"only an evil person\" would think about taking a little girl with cancer's wig. \n\nI defended Hayley and said that Ella and the others were clearly bullying and tormenting her, but my sister said it's not her or her daughter's problem if Hayley can't handle \"girly teasing\". \n\nMy parents and my sister/BIL \"agreed\" that they want a written apology from Hayley to Ella, one which \"shows that she understands what a cruel thing she did\". I said that was not going to happen. \n\nWe left with Hayley but I'm still seething. I'm truly sorry that Ella is having to go through cancer. But she was tormenting my daughter, ganging up on her and filming the whole thing.

Your sister and BIL are (understandably) overprotective of Ella due to her cancer diagnosis, but it's gone beyond reason and is now impacting your daughter. \"But she has cancer\" is not a justification for horrible behavior, and the longer they continue to allow Ella free reign, the more twisted she'll grow up to become (as harsh as that sounds). As Hayley's father, you have a duty and an obligation to protect her\u2014regardless of the personal circumstances of the people hurting her.\n\nThink of things this way: how badly would you regret it if you allowed this continue, and as a result, your daughter got seriously hurt?

No wonder she's found a very dysfunctional way to cope with her anger and her fear. I wonder if her parents encourage it. I wouldn't be surprised, they may be sharing the sentiments. \n\nThat said, nobody should be allowed to torment and bully someone else. Being terminally ill (assuming she's terminally ill and won't be able to beat the cancer) is not a ticket to be a monster for the while you're alive.

Privately though I'd tell your daughter that while you understand her feelings and that she was being bullied pulling the wig off and throwing it in the puddle was not appropriate and you hope she'll get you sooner if she's being bullied and let you handle it but not to physically retaliate herself. Also that you aren't mad at her. Then sit down and have a bowl of ice cream or a treat like that together and talk about her feelings and ways to deal with these situations. Also tell your parents that you are upset they aren't also defending your daughter who was being bullied and humiliated and it was being filmed to put on the internet so she'd get even more bullied. And then say if you aren't going to also realize she was hurt first and only reacted the only way a 7 yr old could think of then perhaps they needed a break from seeing all of you. One of my oncology appointments we had to sit in the area where people were getting IV chemotherapy. There was a mom with w kids in there, one of the kids was getting the chemo. We could clearly overhear them and she was making the younger child feel so awful I wanted to cry. She made him hold the bowl the other kid was throwing up into because (insert kid's name wants you to hold it so he feels better. Even the nurses were trying to intervene and take the bowl to hold and mom kept insisting it was brother's job that he always does to not be a bad boy. Also younger brother had to also help older brother at home after chemo with vomiting. And do his chores until he felt better, which the younger boy actually got some backbone and said so forever then because he never feels better enough to do them. (I wanted to applaud). And they discussed the treat they'd go get after chemo which older brother got to pick like always  (this I kind of agree with tbh). And little brother wanted to know why he couldn't pick dinner since older brother wouldn't feel good enough to eat it anyway which seemed reasonable and mom went off. Badly enough that I'm sure the people on the other side of the  building could hear her. I get she was under a lot of stress but the other kids needs and wants are also important and shouldn't be ignored nor should he have ever been put in charge of emesis containers and all the chores. Having a kid with cancer is scary. Having cancer is terrifying. My husband is constantly worried about mine and the effects my chemo is having on me, I have leukemia and take a daily chemo pill so not as difficult all at once as the IV chemo but it is every day no breaks with tons of the same side effects just slightly less severe. So very long story but keep standing up for your daughter. Having cancer as a kid doesn't mean they get to be complete bullies and jerks. Occasionally being overwhelmed and having a tantrum or anxiety attack absolutely but not bullying younger children.

She let go of me, ran up to Ella, pulled her wig off and threw it into the puddle\n\nYour daughter was so fed up of being bullied and picked on, with no one defending her, protecting her, or standing up for her, as a *7 year old*, that she *did it herself* the only way she could in that moment.  \n\n>They took Ella into a room to calm her down, but my parents went mad at Hayley, saying taking Ella's wig off was a \"disgusting thing to do\". They said Hayley has \"no idea what Ella has to face every day\" (my dad has also survived cancer so this is quite personal to him). \n\nShe then, after *defending herself, at age 7*, was *punished verbally* by her *grandparents*. What did you do while your daughter was berated by your parents for trying to stand up for herself? \n\n>I defended Hayley and said that Ella and the others were clearly bullying and tormenting her, but my sister said it's not her or her daughter's problem if Hayley can't handle \"girly teasing\". \n\nWhat's good for the goose is good for the gander. If what she was doing (whilst she has cancer) was \"girly teasing\", then what she got in return (whilst she has cancer) is also \"girly teasing\". Her illness does not give her immunity from consequences.  \n\n>My parents and my sister/BIL \"agreed\" that they want a written apology from Hayley to Ella, one which \"shows that she understands what a cruel thing she did\". I said that was not going to happen. \n\nYour parents, sister and BIL can lick a puddle.  \n\n>We left with Hayley but I'm still seething. I'm truly sorry that Ella is having to go through cancer. But she was tormenting my daughter, ganging up on her and filming the whole thing. Hayley obviously shouldn't have taken the wig, but she was very upset and being bullied.  \n\nThe person you owe an apology to here is *your daughter*. You should have never allowed her to be bullied, let alone for *two fucking years*.  \nIt got so bad that your child, who is 7, had to take things into her own hands to try and protect herself and get the harrassment to stop.  \nOP, I mean this with the most kindness I can, that's *heartbreaking*. Your daughter has seen you ignore her being mistreated for two years. She didn't trust you to protect her, and why should she?  \n\n>Ella still had the phone and was filming us, and said \"maybe we'll make her do it later.\"\n\nEven Ella knows she can continue to bully your child the second you turn away. She even said it *in front of you*. That's why your daughter threw her wig in the puddle. She knew you, her mother, weren't going to protect her. So she had to try and make it stop herself.  \n\nAs for the bullying itself- teasing and being mean is one thing. \"Daring\" another child, especially a *younger* child to do something gross and humiliating, is another. It's then another thing entirely when that behaviour escalates into pressure and demanding that younger child to perform the act- including recruiting other children to partake in the taunting and pressuring of that child. Adding to that, the filming of that child doing the humiliating and gross act under duress is the cherry on this shit sundae.  \nYour child is *not safe* around these children. Your child *has not been safe* around these children for a long time.  \n\nStep up and be a mother to your daughter, OP. Protect her. Stop playing happy family, because this is not a happy family. This is a family that is letting your daughter be humiliated and pressured into doing something she isn't comfortable with, and that could hurt her. Want to know what other kinds of situations are similar?  \nOnes that are illegal and are often called *abuse*.  \nSo stop teaching your daughter that she doesn't matter, that her safety doesn't matter, and that if someone has a bad thing going on in their life, they can abuse her. Because that *is* what you're teaching her. And she *will* learn from this.  \n\nYour sister is potentially robbing her daughter of life just as much as the cancer is. She is teaching her daughter that her illness means she has no consequences, requires no responsibility or reflection on her actions, and can treat others without regard. She is stealing her daughter's chance to grow into a balanced, emotionally healthy individual, likely out of the intense fear of losing her daughter to cancer.  \nThis child isn't happy. This child is limitless, without boundaries, isn't being supported or guided- she is being provided anything and everything she wants, and is being treated as if made of glass. It undermines her strength, it denies her opportunities to grow and learn, and will mean that if she goes into remission, she will have to work relentlessly to undo the immense amount of awful values her parents instilled in her at a young age.  \n\nDon't let your daughter be exposed to her abusers again.

They are raised to feel entitled and that includes Op's kid.\n\nI hope OP had a conversation with her kid about pulling the wig off her cousin's head because that's not okay either. They were not in a fight. OP was there and she could have walked away with her mother, but the kid decided to go and do a very shitty thing in my opinion. It's never okay to pull a kid's wig off of their head.", "This is peak Reddit. \"I don't like what they say and will cut them down to make myself look better.\" Easy yo say they are wrong, but rings hollow when you don't give a solution. So tell me what you do? Allow the mistreatment to keep happening? Not stand up for their child? You example is trying to undercut the seriousness of the situation: This could mess up both kids for life and the parents have no respect for anyone but themselves. So tell me, family or not, would you stay?", "I hope they keep it and watch it and realize that the cancer might go into remission but their daughter is going to grow up to be a shit.", "I hope it wasn't and was shown to the parents so they could hear their \"poor baby\" taking her jealousy and anger out on someone younger than her by bullying them. Just because she has cancer does not give her free reign to treat people whatever way she deems fit.\n\nOP, I doubt you will see this, but NTA, however, you should have a talk to your daughter about her actions. While they are understandable, they won't be condoned when she gets older, so you need to have a talk to her about how to stand up for and protect herself from bullies in the future.", "Except the times it mentions other kids.", "Maybe take a break.  But a huge permanent rupture?  Over the actions of a little girl and parents who are probably losing their minds with worry?  Look, nobody is sane in that situation.  So sure, step back, let things cool off.  But a permanent divorce over this seems too strong.", "100% and grandparents", "Do you have kids?  Kids do mean shit to each other because they are little savages.  Part of parenting is teaching them that behaving this way is unacceptable.  Now is a teachable moment for both girls.  But what are you suggesting they teach Hayley?  That being violent, destroying property and humiliating others is just fine, as long as your feelings are hurt?   That is a really, really bad lesson to teach.", "Hayley also needs to learn her behavior was not ok.  If OP justifies it, what does Hayley learn?  That she can be violent any time she feels bad?", "Shit, really? This is fucking awesome!", "Fork! Shirt!", "I think it would cause way more harm than good.", "Sounds like they need a big family meeting without the kids.  They need a plan to talk with both girls about bad behavior, and both girls need consequences.  Everybody needs to get on the same page and provide a united front that shows the girls that it's unacceptable to behave like this.", "Not all conflict is abuse.  Their situation does not sound parallel to yours.", "So if OP didn't address this for two years, how much of this problem is due to OP's poor conflict resolution skills?", "I mean.. OP can also tell her niece to not be a dick. Everyone noticed that Ella is acting out.. but nobody is correcting her or advising therapy. That makes all the grown ups suck in this story.", "I'm thinking it's the line where OP says they should have put a stop to this awhile ago but didn't want to look like the bad guy for doing that to a sick kid", "i guess for not telling ella off sooner for being a jerk just bc they think they'll look bad scolding a sick child, and maintaining contact with the family of AHs, which allowed hayley to be bullied by ella.", "Yes, I think both girls acted terribly and both girls need some consequences.", "Leave it bro is on a mission to defend Ella.", "That wasn't self-defense.  It was being vindictive.", "Kids can definitely know better and can be mean on purpose let\u2019s not pretend they can\u2019t . Even with the perfect education they might get rude or mean in certain situations so that\u2019s not true. And while it was nice to pull the wig off she was being bullied and it was not the first time it happened if adults have limits to what they can accept and stay calm how much do you think a 7 year old can handle ?", "Fuck around and find out.", "Yeah the wig thing definitely needs to be addressed as well, no doubt.", "Yup. The parents created this and probably from how the grandparents raised them. All of the adults are AHs here.", ">I hope OP had a conversation with her kid about pulling the wig off her cousin's head because that's not okay either.\n\nI think the point PP was trying to make is that OP needed to defend his kid in order to prevent this situation. Hayley lashed out and grabbed the wig because she was desperate - if the bullying had been responded to immediately by an adult when it was observed, she wouldn't have felt the need to do that.", "I keep offering a solution:  a meeting of the adults in which they hammer out common rules and consequences for both girls.", "Right? Her behavior is not going to just going to magically become pleasant if her cancer goes into remission.", "I bet they won't. Parents seldom stop parenting out of guilt when their child recovers, be it something like cancer or something like premature birth.\n\nThey're too busy trying to overcompensate for the discomfort their child went through, and their own feelings of guilt for not being able to prevent or fix it.\n\nI knew a family whose youngest daughter was diagnosed with leukemia and she was allowed to get away with murder because her parents were trying their best to keep everything afloat with her siblings, and her favorite gotcha line was \"I have cancer!\" It always got her what she wanted.\n\nShe's years into remission and she's still a horrendous little snit of a human being because they never had the heart to discipline her, they were too afraid her last memory of them would be scolding her for something she did, or that she'd pass away hating them, or she'd pass before they could make it up to her, like it was their fault she had cancer.", "[removed]", "I think Ella needs to start seeing a child psychologist ASAP. She is only escalating it sounds like. Obviously her parents refuse to correct or even parent she needs an authority figure to let her know her behavior is not okay. I am sure some of it is emotional turmoil whether fear, anger etc due to her sickness but she needs to learn healthy coping mechanisms.", "She's 7. Her emotional control is appropriate for her age, I'd say. She's not supposed to handle bullying like a 40 yo therapist.", "No..when I was bullied I was always told to \"be the bigger person\" and to \"just ignore the bullying\".   \nIt probably would have stopped had I hit the bullies where it hurt. Hayley knows the pressure point of her cousin. Is it a good thing to do in normal circumstances? No.. but Ella was bullying a 7 year old... quite hardcore actually. She deserved the pulling of the wig. Maybe she learns to not bully others. But she won't as long as mommy, daddy and her grandparents will excuse everything she does because she sadly had cancer.", "If they keep demanding that a seven years old apologizes for being bullied, it might not. No matter her motivations the little girl is being a malicious bully and her parents are supporting her, why would you stick around for that? Going LC unless it's a family emergency sounds reasonable, what is there to gain to visiting them aside from a bullied daughter?", "This isn't a one-off incident. Ella has been terrorizing her cousins for a while now and without any adult intervention. This isn't a \"take a break and then go back thing\". This is a \"stop going and only return if the issue gets addressed properly AND Hayley wants to go back\"-thing. While Ella deserves support, that shouldn't come in form of an even younger child she can treat as she pleases.", "You remind me of schools where both the bully and the victim are punished cause the victim pushed back.", "The little girl reacted out because she was being bullied and no one was supporting her. Should she got a talk about lines not to cross in retaliation? Sure. Should she also be allowed to talk out her emotions in a constructive manner? Sure.\n\nThat's about it.", "What do you suggest they teach Ella? That it's okay to be a raging little monster because she has cancer and a wrecked immune system and Hayley deserves a little misery too?\n\nHayley is 7 and her reaction was absolutely normal for a child her age. She will learn to better regulate her emotions, she can talk with her parents about how unsafe she felt and how she can do things differently moving forward that won't automatically mean she's isolated and left out of the group because she won't be their whipping girl.\n\nElla is 9 and is bullying smaller children to lick mud puddles so she can take a video on her phone. Again, what do you recommend she be taught to correct her behavior?", "This was Hayley\u2019s breaking point. Ella has been terrorizing her for more than just this incident as OP said in the post.", "That's what the point of my first sentence is. An explanation is not the same as a justification. You can acknowledge the why behind something while critiquing it, and growing from it.", "And again, what are Ella's parents teaching her?\n\nThat she's untouchable and above reproach because she's sick, so it's perfectly fine that she's constantly bullying her cousin?", "Sure is!", "I snorted coffee at this \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Someone call?", "What???", "Holy Motherforking Shirtballs!", "Maybe but OP's first priority is his children.", "Forcing your child to apologise for retaliating against a long-standing bully will do more harm than good.\n\nLetting the bullying continue will do more harm than good.\n\nWhat good are you trying to achieve anyway? The family looking peaceful on the outside? Or OP's daughter having stable mental health and not catching Weil's disease?", "Yeah we should have these kids work out their issues between themselves, in the thunder dome.\n\nThey aren't going to learn anything without old fashioned blood sport.", "Serious question, when the entire family except OP refuses to acknowledge that the niece is bullying the younger girl, how exactly do think a family meeting would go?", "Except Hayley didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She defended herself from a bully. If Hayley were my kid, she\u2019d be getting a trip to the ice cream parlor and be allowed to get the biggest bowl of ice cream known to man. I WISH I had had the balls to stand up to my bullies the way Hayley did here.", "You keep saying that but it is clear Hayley will never face consequences so now what ?", "Actually it is, so your suggesting OP should just let their child be bullied and abused? Because as it stands Ella's parents won't do anything nor will grandparents...with family like that who needs enemies? That's not fair or healthy for Haley, the only alternative is cut them off to protect her.", "Vindictive towards bullies is allowed.", "Nah it really wasn't. Ella was threatening Hayley to make her lick to puddle later. This was literally self defense. Maybe it will stop how that Hayley hit her cousin where it hurts the most.   \n\n\nEverybody here expecting a literal 7 year old to show more self control than most humans posses after being harassed and bullied by her cousin. F that.", "Nope. It was a reasonable response to a threat of future bullying. \n\nThe bully was stopped by OP and instead of being the least remorseful, she threatened the victim. Hailey was basically informed that whenever she was alone with her cousin, the bullying would resume.\n\nI have always taught my girls that violence is not OK - unless you need to defend yourself. If you do, I will not blame you. And one of them actually did draw blood once, at the age of 5 or so, being cornered by two boys who wanted to \"see her underwear\". Her knee hit one of their noses somehow...  Both me and the teacher said my girl did good and made the boys apologize. \n\nThe wig thing is appropriate in my opinion. Maybe it makes the bully think twice, realizing she is not invincible.", "I would agree, if the parents had handled this properly. None did, which shows that these kids never even had a chance to know what the right thing was.", "And if that can't happen? The other parents obviously don't think their kid did anything wrong? So what then? What if one party refuses to admit they are wrong and won't take responsibility?", "Yep, having cancer is no excuse to be an asshole", "I guarantee it's going to get worse, and her parents are gonna make the excuse about her surviving cancer.", "telling kids to just grin and bear it is the worst shit and just enabling abuse. its like sticking a cats nose in its piss, yeah it feels awful but sometimes it just has to be done. dont dish out what you cant take", "I think forced apologies are useless.  So take that off the table.\n\nSetting joint rules for behavior and having the adults enforce them consistently is the only thing that will keep both girls from growing up to be assholes.  Right now, all OP has taught her daughter is how to eat it and eat it until she explodes.  Not a great lesson for either parents or kids.", "So what's you answer?  Let both children and adults resort to violence any time their feelings get hurt?  That's how you end up with crazy people doing acts of mass violence.", "Ella was awful.  Ella definitely needs to hear that her behavior was way out of bounds, and she needs a consequence.   And so does Hayley.  Both girls were out of line.", "u/sir_thatguy, apparently.", "It's from The Good Place. You can't swear there so when you try to say \"fuck\" and \"shit\", it comes out as \"fork\" and \"shirt\".", "I think cutting kids off from their family is a drastic measure that harms them.  There are circumstances where it is really necessary.  But this is a little girl acting like a jerk, as little girls sometimes do.   Better to try and get the family on the same page than have Ella lose her grandparents, no?", "I didn't say that.  I think both sets of parents need to get on board with limits and consequences for both girls, because they were both awful.", "Worth a try, at least.", "She could have walked in the house.  She could have screamed for help.  She could have stood her ground in utter silence.  She had a lot of alternatives to ripping Ella's wig off.\n\nElla is 100% a jerk.  But Hayley is not an angel here either.", "Doesn't seem clear at all.   Has OP had a reasonable meeting of the adults?  Has she expressed a wish to set rules for both girls?  Has she accepted that Hayley was also in the wrong?  So far, all we have seen is her justifying her own daughter's bad behavior.  No wonder the other parents defended their daughter---it's a dysfunctional response all the way around.", "No, I am suggesting they all get together and discuss rules that will keep both girls safe.", "Ella thinks she was bullied by Hayley.  Ok if Ella goes and hurts her, then?\n\nThat kind of behavior just creates a cycle of violence.", "Why would op be telling his bullied child to apologize before she herself gets an apology for the countless times she was bullied? Don\u2019t go slap someone multiple times they play the everyone is wrong when you finally get punched", "Ohhhh, makes sense. Tysm for explaining!", "> Better to try and get the family on the same page than have Ella lose her grandparents, no?\n\nThe adults need to have a talk amongst themselves and hand out equitable punishments for both Ella and Hayley. \n\nThe problem is it appears none of the other adults see Ella in the wrong due to her cancer situation.", "Do you think her parents are setting limits? This girl was abusing the other girls around her, and the only consequences that she is seeing is being deprived of the company of the girl that she's abusing, not by her parents but by the victims father. The thing you are asking for is going to results in this girl abusing other little girls.", "Gotta be a jerk to stop the jerks.", "The bullying is not a one time event. It has been happening regularly. You choose to not read the part of the post that disprove your argument . Op directly says that she terrorize her cousins plural and her parents defend her at every turn . So why are you pretending they are reasonable and can just be talked with and listen ?", "Ella's parents and grandparents have already shown a lack of interest in doing that. OP has a right to protect their child from this toxic environment and due to Ella's parents lack of actual parenting the only option is removing them from their lives", "I don't disagree, but this is where the adults have to be adults and force both children to apologize. If the other girl wouldn't apologize, I wouldn't bring my daughter to play with her anymore. Even if it is my niece. I don't expect the kids to do the right thing, I expect the adults to. Both kids behaved poorly. Both have something to apologize for. Someone has to go first. This altercation was over. I wouldn't really disagree if it was done in self defense to stop it from happening, but that was over. The kid with cancer is the most awful here, but like I said, I was taught 2 wrongs don't make a right. All of these parents are awful. OP even let this go on prior.", "And then you have an entire society of assholes and people afraid of assholes.  Is that how you want to live?", "You only know one side of the story, of course.  But there is lots of ground between doing nothing and being violent or cutting everyone off.\n\nJesus, does nobody in this country have any conflict resolution skills at all?"]}
