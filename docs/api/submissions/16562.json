The prestige of a university means nothing nowadays,\u201d\n\nDefinitely debatable. It means something to those whose egos rely on that kind of validation, which is somewhat common among people of high academic caliber. Also, for certain professions, graduating from a name-brand institution gives you some instant credibility that plays a role in your job prospects, at least initially.", "She might've specifically been targeting op, or she dm'd several people the same thing to see who would bite and admit it.", "\u201cGet ready, rotten things usually come back around.\u201d\n\nWhat do you mean?", "This story is reposted weekly, she wasn\u2019t the victim of anything", "Things like what you described have an odd habit of coming back around and biting you in the ass down the road.

A world where we can passively sit around and wait for justice to magically descend upon corruption from heaven? \n\nNo. Taking a quick glance at some of the most powerful people who exploit others and have lived and died without retribution clearly demonstrates that in most cases, there is no karmic justice unless you actively demand it for yourself.\n\nAs such, there is and was no reason for me to believe that she would certainly \u201cdig her own hole\u201d in the future.", "...and she may have created the next school shooter, or woman who drives off a cliff with her kids, or Marjorie Taylor Greene, or something of the like.", "Amen!", "Ask yourself this.
