Didn't look for it until she got home, found out the ring must have fallen out of her training bag somewhere between the gym and home. Didn't tell me she'd lost her ring, I found out from my kids instead.\n\nHer wedding ring has strong sentimental value to me. I bought us matching gold bands when we married, and each year on our anniversary I go to a jeweller and have one diamond set into the band. Number fourteen was added a few months ago.\n\nIt's quite literally irreplaceable.\n\nShe'd come home while I was getting dinner ready, and she went straight to have a shower. When my kids told me she'd lost her ring, I immediately went searching for it. Emptied the training bag, checked the car, came up empty handed.\n\nI didn't say anything at dinner. She didn't say anything either. We both went to bed without speaking.\n\nI woke up this morning, made the lunch boxes for our kids, got ready for work, and she got up as I was leaving and asked me if I'm upset. I said I was upset about the ring, and left.\n\nThe ring is a thing, not a person, and therefore not as important as my wife or our relationship. But it's also a symbol, full of meaning, and it's infuriating to know it's gone and she didn't take better care of it, put it in her purse or somewhere more secure than rolling around loose in a gym bag.\n\nAITA for giving her the cold shoulder?", "created_utc": 1698830807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17l87mx/aita_for_giving_my_wife_the_silent_treatment_when/", "score": 619, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, the ring is special, you can feel upset about it, but how do you know your wife doesn't also feel really bad about it? Maybe she's planning on going to the gym later to look, or look in the car? You don't know because you're too busy having a sulky tantrum to talk.  \nMaybe she didn't say anything because she knew you'd react this way", "YTA - I understand you're upset but things like this happen. Objects get lost and yes, it sucks, but they're objects. I bet your wife feels horrible and sad and now not only is a precious object gone but also the person who is supposed to love and support her is being cold. Is that worth it?\n\nQuick story time: my dad gave my mum a necklace when my sister was born, my mum wore it a lot. One time they were travelling, mum taking care of us two toddlers. Somewhere at a rest stop while feeding us kids, one of us must have grabbed the necklace and torn it without her noticing. She realized hours later and my dad got so mad he told her she was too stupid to be trusted with jewellery and he'd never give her any jewellery ever again. He kept his promise until he died a few years later. This moment of grief and humiliation stuck with her so much, she told us the story several times over the years, mostly whenever we lost something. She was still sad about the loss of the necklace but even more still hurt by him being an ass to her. \n\nNow think: is THIS how you'd want to be remembered? As the jerk who made a painful situation worse?\n\nNo? Then go to your wife now, give her a hug. Go out together, look for the ring, you might just get lucky. You don't need to go out and buy a replacement, money doesn't grow on trees after all. But maybe for Christmas or her birthday, get her something nice, something that looks different to the lost ring, and tell her you'll together fill it with more beautiful memories.", "YTA\n\nThe silent treatment is juvenile.\n\nIt's also controlling behavior and a form of emotional abuse.\n\nWant a healthy relationship? Learn how to be angry and loving at the same time. It's possible.\n\nI wonder if your wife didn't tell you, because she knew you'd react like an AH from past experiences.", "Being a bit upset - yeah. The monetary (I assume 14 diamonds cost something) and the emotional value are lost, so yeah being upset is perfectly normal. \n\nBut silent treatment? Because of an accident? That's kind of a childish way to express yourself. \n\nAlso the main reason you seem to be angry for is that your wife doesn't seem to put the same emotional value to the rings as you do. It that respect I'd like to remind you that people are different and some people just don't emotionally attach to things while other people do. Nor one is right or wrong, just different. \n\nsoft ESH, you for the childish silent treatment, her for not understanding how much it means to you and not telling you sensitively first.", "If you realize it is an accident and she didn't intentionally lose it, why are you trying to keep her responsible for it? Do you hold resentment for her training or something else that in your opinion equates to \"if she wasn't going out of home she wouldn't have lost it\"? \n\nYTA, she is probably as upset about losing HER ring as you are. But you are putting the blame on her.", "YTA\n\nHow does the silent treatment enhance the situation? Is the ring less lost? Is your wife not bothered?\n\nTry having a conversation instead of expressing yourself like a child.", "INFO: Do you often give people/your wife the silent treatment when you're upset?\n\nYou should have heard the truth from your wife, not your kids. However if the silent treatment is something you often do, she might have put off telling you specifically to avoid getting the silent treatment from you. The silent treatment accomplished nothing. She probably already feels guilty for losing her ring, what does ignoring her accomplish? Ignoring her isn't gonna make the ring suddenly materialize. There are better ways to deal with your feelings than ignoring your wife. Accidents happen.", " *it's also a symbol, full of meaning, and it's infuriating to know it's gone and she didn't take better care of it,* \n\nA symbol of what?

Your marriage isn't dependent on a ring, it's the relationship you've built up with your wife and the trust that comes with it. This was an honest accident, she didn't mean to lose it. Her reluctance to bring up the subject with you suggests she knew you'd react badly and you have.", "Without more information ESH. The silent treatment is not *usually* really a good form of communication. It sounds like you guys are struggling in that department. \n\nYour wife is an AH for not telling you. Especially if she knew how important it was to you. Also she told the kids but not you? Then says nothing at dinner?\n\nI happen to agree that if it was truly loose in her gym bag that that's a bit disrespectful. Again, assuming she knows how important it is to you which I'm guessing she does. \n\nI will get downvotes though as no one else seems to agree that your wife not telling you or communicating is also kind of ah behavior\n\nPlease update us", "YTA \n\nYour wife probably didn\u2019t tell you until she was absolutely sure that she lost it. She could\u2019ve went back to the gym the next day to see if she can find it before telling you. You can be mad but the silent treatment is childish. You can express how you feel without it turning into a full blown argument.", "Yeah YTA.\n\nSilent treatment is childish and insolent behaviour. \n\n>It's quite literally irreplaceable.\n\nIf I maybe as childish as you, a gold band with 14 diamonds *is* replaceable. \n\n>it's also a symbol, full of meaning, and it's infuriating to know it's gone and she didn't take better care of it, put it in her purse or somewhere more secure than rolling around loose in a gym bag.\n\nIt's just a bloody ring, mate. You've invested a ridiculous amount of emotion in an object. You've put these mad feelings on it. You can't be giving silent treatment to your wife for that.\n\nIt's fine to be annoyed at the loss but the silent treatment and the way you're talking about it is a bit mad.", "Grownups don't \"give the silent treatment\".\n\nThey communicate and discuss and empathise like - you know - grownups.\n\nYTA.", "Things can be replaced.

Seriously, just grow up and communicate. What sort of relationship is this?", "Yup YTA, sometimes people make mistakes and things get lost. I can bet there are many other reasons as to why she avoided you other than just the ring\u2026 super cringe.", "YTA. Yep, it\u2019s just a ring man! Grow up. Keep that cold shoulder crap up over stuff like that and you\u2019ll be in danger of more then her just losing a ring.", "YTA \n\nSilent treatment is a form of abuse. People lose their wedding rings, people break them, shit happens no matter how much you try and keep them close and secure. You seem to be forgetting your wife and your love for each other is what is important and you acting like this is likely making her second guess this.", "The ring is not \"irreplaceable.\" You can go to the jeweler and buy another ring with 14 diamonds. Sure, it won't be cheap, but you can get another one. \n\nYTA the silent treatment is never ok in a marriage. She is probably terrified to tell you because she fears your emotional response. If you are willing to resort to the silent treatment, you probably respond immaturely to bad news. Give her a hug and tell her that it was an accident. Then go together to the training center to look for it.", "YTA it\u2019s absolutely replaceable and just a freaking ring.", "YTA\n\nLook at your reaction and think 8f there's a reason why your why didn't feel like she could tell you herself.", "YTA. Don't you think your wife is feeling bad enough as it is? It is annoying to the nth degree to loose a valuable object, but at the end of the day it is just an object. Your role is to be supportive of your wife. Giving her the silent treatment is never a good idea. It is certainly not strengthening your marriage. Neither are diamonds, even if they hadn't been lost.", "YTA. My husband came to me meekly today, because he already lost his wedding band, we got married Saturday. He has issues with his fingers swelling and shrinking. It slid off his finger and he doesn't know where.\n\nWas I mad? Very much so. His ring was custom, and one of a kind, we had materials included from milestones together on the inside. We have been together 12 years before being married. \n\nI lost my first engagement ring. I was sick, and my fingers swelled, so I took it off. I forgot where I put it. My partner was angry. Eventually, we found it, under a floormat in the car. He never made me feel bad over something I already felt guilty about.\n\nSilent treatment as an adult fixes nothing, and just adds to her guilt. Mistakes happen.", "YTA, my husband lost his ring while swimming in the sea, it was before our first wedding anniversary, he was sad, and so was I, we never once fought about it,\n\n If losing  ring is your biggest problem, you are one lucky man.", "YTA.\n\nI am one of those women who would hold something back like this because of how I know my husband would react.\n\nI am sure she is shattered inside; would do anything to have had it not disappear and is quietly desperate, wishing she could have felt like she could have come to you and gotten understanding, support and love. I am sure she has a broken heart.\n\nInstead she is coping as best as she could; trying to figure out if she could find it and worried about how you would react.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you will hear me on this, but your reaction is driving a wedge between you two. Of course you can be upset. But don\u2019t assume there isn\u2019t pain on her side.", "YTA\n\nMaybe she was planning on looking for it today.\n\nMaybe she knew you would be mad.\n\nMaybe a thousand things.\n\nBut no one knows because you decided to give her the silent treatment instead of talking to her.\n\nDo I think she should have told you? Yeah, a bit. But I can understand why she wouldn\u2019t if she knew you would act like this.", "NTA - Because if this had been the other way around. This group would have thought you were cheating. \n\nOP it sounds like what you are really upset about is the fact that the kids told you and not your wife. I agree that it is not the best way to find out. Is there any insurance that would cover it. Even the warranty might cover something. You should go and take a look. \n\nTalk to your wife. It a sad situation but not one to mess up a marriage over.", "YTA\nAbsolutely and unreservedly one.  You think she wanted to lose her ring?  Her ring btw, not yours.  The reason you found out from the kids is probably because she was afraid to tell you and I can see why.  Damn you are worst.", "YTA. You said it yourself - it's a thing and not as important as your wife and your relationship. How does the cold shoulder resolve anything?

She didn't lose it deliberately, and giving her the silent treatment is childish and petty.\n\nSince it was only yesterday, it may be that she was planning to contact the gym and talk to the other members of the class to see if anyone found it, before talking to you.\n\nIt's fine to be upset that it has been lost, but your way of showing that it childish and, give that it doesn't appear that she was particularly careless ( gym bag should have been safe), more than a little unreasonable", "YTA\n\nYou remind me of my BIL. Sister lost her ring and he freaked out. Refused to talk to her for almost two weeks. They have two twins that saw all of this. \n\nEmotional abuse is easily one of the worst kinds of abuse in my opinion. If you cut me I'll heal. But emotional damage can last a life time.\n\nEvery time I see my Sister I let her know that if she needs it, her and her children always have a place.\n\nHow you treat your spouse is the most important thing. A thing like a ring is at the bottom of the list. Are you sure you just aren't looking for an excuse to be angry?", "The cold shoulder for a day or 2 until you have gotten over your initial anger is probably better than the other unhealthy alternative of blowing up and potentially saying something that can not be unsaid.\n\nPlease don't stay silent for too long and have a calm conversation with your wife, and let her know how much that this has hurt you. At the same time, if you love her and want to stay with her, you will have to forgive her. I'm sure that she is absolutely mortified and furious with herself for being careless.", "Yes, YTA. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re upset. But things get lost. It doesn\u2019t mean she did something wrong. \n\nYou mentioned you\u2019ve been married 14 years.

A ring can be replaced; a memorial charm that was given by my she decreased grandmother could never be. Everyone assumed my best friend, who I'd known for a year, took it; I refused to believe (she is still my BFF 15 years later). Anyway. I finally found the necklace... in my apartment... inside a jar candle. Once I found it there, I remembered vaguely putting it in there because it had a lid, and I didn't want it to get thrown out while I was cleaning, and I didn't want to catch the chain cleaning which is why I'd not put it right back on. Things get lost dude. It's not intentional, and I'm sure your wife is hurting worse than you because she is the one who lost it. It's OK to be upset, but so icing your wife out for an honest mistake.", "YTA. I have to ask- is this the typical way that you respond to mistakes she makes?

This could help recover part of the cost.", "YTA\n\nUse your words, guy.  Throwing a grown up tantrum like this speaks volumes about why your wife didn't tell you.  Grow up.  It's a thing.

As you said, it\u2019s not even about the physical ring, so much as the fact that she lacked communication skills and respect.

It's just a ring. Go to your wife, tell her you overreacted, that you love her and that you feel horrible that she didn't feel she could tell you.

If he'd told her \"I'm really upset and don't want to say anything hurtful, so let's give each other some time.\" that would have been gathering one's thoughts to be able to communicate well later.\n\nNOT talking to your partner at all is abusive.", "The thing that bothers me is, that OP seems to be angry not for the secret so much as for the loss itself - which was an accident that happens to quite a lot of people honestly. And the other thing he seems to be angry about is her not being invested more emotionally in the symbolics of the ring the same way he is. \n\nIf he was angry only about the secret that would be reasonable - still silent treatment seems like a childish way of getting back at her in any case :D", "They probably saw how upset she was. I doubt she sat them down and formally informed them of the loss.  Kids just sort of hang around and see everything and would definitely see mom frantically searching for her lost ring.", "I agree with that", "That was after he started checking through her stuff so she could already tell he was pissed. Id stop speaking to my bf too if i could tell he was in that mood out of caution to not piss him off more.", "If that's the case then why not mention it? It seems like it'd be relevant.", "It's not *that* literal! OP isn't upset he has lost 14 diamonds.\n\nCos things get lost. That's life.

Is it not important enough to secure it? I\u2019m sorry but if I\u2019m taking my wedding band off, it\u2019s going into a zipped pocket in a locked locker, not rolling around loose in my gym bag.", "It is her wedding ring, why does she has to first apologize to her husband about it? Share and look for support for the loss and how disappointed she is, maybe some hope that she could still find it if they go back or look through every blouse and shoe and sock in her bag etc - sure, but why the first reaction you are looking for is that she has to apologize?", "Your comment literally says the fact that she didn\u2019t say anything is evidence of it not being an accident.", "He was not speaking to her because he was angry. He\u2019s told us that. We don\u2019t know why she wasn\u2019t speaking to him. It might have been because he was angry and she didn\u2019t want a fight.", "Sounds like she's scared of him almost. She's had the ring 14 years, not like she's careless with it often.", "After not losing it for fourteen years.", "Or she wanted a few minutes to figure out the best way to tell him so he didn't act like a petulant child and give her the silent treatment, rather than the kids blurting it out?", "Saying nothing is different than a silent treatment though. One is choosing to wait to communicate until you are in a better place, the other is maliciously withholding communication as punishment.", "She lost the ring, tried to hide it from him (the children were the ones to tell him) and didn't try to adress the issue since then, only asked if he's upset.", "Is it though?? RAGE inducing? Really? Because someone lost a ring by complete accident? It\u2019s not as though OP said she has a habit of being careless with it or lost it while doing something shitty. All we know from OP is it was an accident and she didn\u2019t tell him right away. The silent treatment isn\u2019t \u201ccooling down\u201d, it\u2019s punishing your partner for something that was completely accidental.", "No, OP called it silent treatment, that means he knows what he's doing.", "Maybe she wanted to take a shower first, or tell him after dinner when the kids were in bed. We don't know she wasn't going to tell him, we just know she didn't tell him immediately. It seems like she didn't ask the kids to lie to their dad, she just hadn't told him yet. If she knew it was going to start an argument or enrage him it was the more reasonable and mature course of action to wait until the kids had gone to bed. I don't know whey people are acting like she actively lied and tried to hide it. It sounds like it had been 5 minutes and she hadn't even had a chance to properly look for it before declaring it lost.", "That\u2019s assuming the silent treatment is something OP does regularly to her, which is a somewhat unfounded assumption.

It\u2019s easy to say things are replaceable when you\u2019re not the one who has to work to replace it. Yea things get lost. You shouldn\u2019t lose things such as a ring that symbolizes your love for your spouse. It\u2019s simple as. It\u2019s not hard to be mindful. My fianc\u00e9 is a vet. She does not work in an environment that\u2019s safe for an engagement ring. You know what she does? She puts it back in it\u2019s box, in her purse, and locks in in her locker. She doesn\u2019t just throw it willy nilly into her bag. You know why? Because it holds value to her and she respects the time and effort I put in to afford that ring to give to her.", "Not all abuse is violent and/or physical, and yes, ignoring your wife because you're upset with her actions is a form of retribution. The intent here is to punish her, make her feel bad, not \"take time for yourself\". And this is abuse.", "Ignoring someone due to malicious intent (i.e., to make them feel bad because you feel bad) is emotional abuse. Telling someone you feel bad and need a time out from talking to them is grown-up communication.", "I wouldn't even feel comfortable walking around with a 10k ring on my finger. I'd be wayyyy too worried I might lose it or something could happen to it. If you break or lose something that cost 300, it sucks but isn't the worst thing ever, but several thousand? Gosh no.", "FWIW, I'm American and it definitely isn't universal. My ring was about $100, which is definitely on the cheap side, but wearing one ring that costs multiple thousands of dollars seems insane to me.", "I think it should be normal to basically keep a potentially important or sentimental ring at home and wear anything else out. Rings can be lost and/or people try to rob you also. I always liked the ring but I remember telling him the expense gave me so much anxiety about wearing it\ud83d\ude15 nowadays people are getting smarter around here about blood diamonds and expensive rings in general (although I bet rich people still don\u2019t care). \n\nA lot of Americans own home safes that can be as small as a pouch or a small little keepsake box. It\u2019s mostly to prevent random people (workers, visitors) from the temptation. Plus they\u2019re usually fireproof so just in case of fire. But I agree that $300 is a max price range, I don\u2019t like wearing things that someone would wanna rob me for.", "I didn't say anything about losing items. I said hiding things. That could be anything. My point is that you cant be biased in favor of either OP or his wife based on your own head cannon.  I'm saying OP is justified to be upset based ONLY on the basic info provided: \"Spouse lost very expensive, very sentimental item and hid it.\" That's a situation where most people would be upset. I don't think most people would be giving their spouse the silent treatment for days over it though.", "Well silent treatment it childish.\n\n\nBut honestly, the wife knows how much the ring means to him, so if not invested for herself, she should be invested for him.\n\n\nIf I lost something my bf treasures a lot, I would be invested for him, despite having difficulty feeling any emotional investment for objects whatsoever.", "I mean - I\u2019d be damn mad if my wife lost something of such significant monetary value. Let alone something that is supposed to symbolise our marriage and commitment to one another. She does come off rather careless and callous in losing her ring + attitude to it (not telling her husband, telling her children instead). \n\nI say this as someone who loses my things rather often and am working on being more careful. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with the silent treatment necessarily but neither do I like how people are downplaying and dismissing OP\u2019s feelings but I think even if we don\u2019t align on the symbolics of such a thing - at least understand why something means so much to me and react accordingly?", "I wasn't insinuating that she sat them down and told them. But that maybe when she got home and was upset about it she possibly said something like 'Oh my God. I can't believe I lost my ring.' \n\nBut obviously she said something about it out loud if her kids heard her. Otherwise, how would they even know what the hell she was looking for?", "No, a ring with 14 diamonds on it was literally lost. Downplaying that as if it\u2019s some trivial novelty keychain with no emotional significance behind it is just ludicrous.", "Dude a ring with 14 diamonds is an insane amount of money. The ring I got my fianc\u00e9 only had 3, totaling 2 carats, and that shit was almost $6k.

Just throwing your 14 diamond wedding band into your gym bag? Not even securing it in a pocket? None of you have worked and saved up to buy an expensive ring and it shows lol.

I wouldn't be jumping to tell him either if that were the case especially if I hadn't looked absolutely everywhere for it and who's to say she directly told their kids they could've just seen her looking for it. There's a lot of different unanswered factors on her end bc he refused to be an adult and have a conversation with her.", "They were probably old enough to help her look. It's more telling to me that she didn't intend to maliciously hide this news, she probably hoped they'd find the ring in her car or something and it would be a non issue. When she didn't find it, she probably didn't tell OP right away because she knew he's flip out and she didn't know how to deliver the news, and if she could find it soon and fix her mistake (say, at the lost and found at the gym) maybe she could avoid having him blow up at her. Even if he found out via the kids, she still had a bit of time before they had to officially talk about it.\n\nFrom the post, OP seems more the type to fix blame than to fix problems, (YTA) so there's no point in telling him really because all he's gonna do is tell her how careless she is instead of helping her go look for it.", "Not worth the silent treatment", "This is entirely an assumption so bear with me, but I doubt mom knew the kids found out. They likely overheard her while she was frantically looking for it. No one expects a kid to be able to keep a secret. \n\nShould she have been the one to tell her husband, yes, absolutely.

We don\u2019t know if she had planned on telling him once she concluded she can\u2019t find it - kids pick up on that stuff way faster so it\u2019s pretty normal to hear that stuff from them when you come home before your partner gets a turn to speak.", "Or maybe she is hoping she can find it without needing to tell him in order to avoid this sort of reaction from him? \n\nHer not telling him immediately doesn't mean she went and fucked the ring off a bridge for a laugh ffs.", "Yes, not saying anything is evidence of something being omitted. That wasn\u2019t really in question.", "Right.

I just put it down a second and voila, lost for 3 hours. \n\nYou don't know if she put it in a pocket, maybe she did. Maybe the zip didn't close properly. Maybe she has a different coat with her without a zipping pocket. Maybe she got distracted and didn't zip it.
