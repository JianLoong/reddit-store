How many people you invite should be based on cost and comfort. If you want more people because you have a bigger family, that is very valid. If there was a cost concern, then of course you can't just add people, and if there is a venue issues, you work it out. She doesn't get to unilaterally decide what size wedding she wants, her objections have to be based in other factors (cost and space). \n\nAnd her attitude in general is bad. You shouldn't be getting middle of the night meltdowns, be afraid to make suggestions, and have entire days ruined because someone had an idea. This is alarming behavior, because you have to wonder if it is about a wedding, or if this is how she is around planning in general or big events, or big life moments. Buying a house could trigger this same kind of behavior, having kids, raising kids, kids getting in trouble, money issues, health emergencies, moving...there are going to be 25-50 major moments in your lives that will be bigger deals than your wedding, without the time and and joy that a wedding also brings. How is she going to handle those? \n\nYou have to talk to her, and definitely push out wedding planning at the very least.", "NTA, at least wait another year to start planning and all that, and definitely reconsider the relationship altogether.

She seems like a person who handles stress extremely poorly. Pushing the wedding back would just annoy her more and would mean that she would stress about it the same way once it came back around.\n\nYou need to communicate with her that she is so poorly handling her stress with the wedding that it is becoming unbearable to work with her on planning it. She could realize that and improve, or she could brush off the issue and keep up the poor stress management and lashing out; if she does the latter I think the wedding should be called off until you both can manage the stress of a big life event well together. \n\nBut you should bring up your issue with her stress management and give her a chance to work on that first before shutting everything down.", "NTA.\n\nBut you should put off the wedding.

In all honesty you should be glad she's showing you this now instead of after there are legal ties between you.

A wedding is about both of you, not just her.

We got engaged in the spring\n\nYou're a bit \"young\" to be getting married.... You're chaining yourself to a person before becoming a fully independent adult.. (presumably).\n\nThat's not the wisest move for either of you.\n\nDisagreements on wedding size are a common problem. You're specifically asking your fiance to accommodate and plan for MORE people. Some of that frustration is understandable.\n\nI'mma buck the trend slightly and say NAH. Pushing back the wedding is likely the responsible thing to do. How fiance reacts to that? who knows? A race to marriage is usually a red flag.\n\nWould your fiance be willing to compromise and change from a total number to a total \"family level\". EG each side invites parents, grands, siblings, and nieces/nephews?", "NTA You do realize this relationship is OVER, right ? Look at how you're describing her. Get out of there before you accidentally get her pregnant.", "NTA -  Swearing at me telling me thst she would just rather not have the wedding then have to invite more people.  - you should take her at her word and just say ok lets not have the wedding until you can be a reasonable person that I fell for. You can tell people their  behavior is unacceptable without being mean or rude. People can only treat you the way you allow them to.  Also if you cant stand the way she is acting maybe need to do some soul searching and make sure  that is the woman you want to spend the next 50 years with. \n\nPeople have a way of excusing behavior because they don't want confrontation. Oh she is just stressed about the wedding - no this is how she handles situations.

How many guests are you planning on having (I only see mention of family, but what about friends or family friends?) Have you guys had the budget talk, the finances talk, the housing talk, the child/child-free talk, the retirement talk, etc?\n\nFrom her side: Does she even want a wedding or would she rather go city hall and call it done? Planning a wedding is a lot more stressful than people realize, and if you have to take family into consideration even more so. Is she stressed about the wedding because it seems like a lot of changes all at once (left the school system and learning to navigate adult life and workplace life, got engaged, now have to plan a big event, learning to budget, etc.) or maybe because she has some insecurities about the future that you guys haven't touched on yet?\n\nBased on your initial statement that she's fresh out of college and you're still in college, I'm guessing that you're around the 20-22 range and she's around 22 to 24? You're both very young, you haven't really had a chance to experience adult life outside of the school system/schedule yet (keeping in mind that we're basically told what to do for the first 20-something years of our lives; leaving a system where we have guidance counsellors and educators to help guide us to suddenly learning how to navigate insurance payments on your own, workplace politics, pulling weight as a newbie in the workplace, etc and you might not be lucky enough to have a mentor/older brother/sister figure to help you out).

So yeah, this is who she is.  I would postpone if I were you, perhaps forever.", "Go to premarital counseling. \nHer cursing you out and not letting you speak without blowing up, not acceptable.

She needs anger management", "INFO: so how many people are you trying to invite exactly? And are you *actually* close with all these people or do you just want to invite them out of politeness?

But you two need to push back the wedding! You are clearly not ready to get married. Couples counseling (or marriage counseling) might be helpful. The day is just that - a day.

Because this is how this person handles stress. This way. It's this. So you have to ask yourself if this is the kind of partner you want when the inevitable happens and something stressful comes along again. I have been married 8 years, and there have been ups and downs and so many things we never expected to happen that are stressful and exhausting.

OP posted in his edit  that HER parents are paying the 25%.", "Wedding planning is only as stressful as you make it.  People are so convinced everything has to be perfect. Honestly weddings can be not stressful if you have the right partner and compromise.  A lot of brides want everything perfect which when it rains on the wedding day it automatically becomes ruined in their minds.  Honestly though to call him YTA nah.

Everyone should experience the combined workload of a full time job and mental load of running a home (meal planning, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, budgeting, laundry, getting out the door for work on time, scheduling car maintenance and doctor's appointments etc.). Then both people understand the effort and show the appropriate appreciation of their partner. Basically learn to be a self sufficient adult instead of treating your partner as a substitute parent.\n\nI completely agree with the rest of your comment though.", "The problem is she needs to say that and also, she shouldn't have gotten that mad at her mom that it ruined a whole day just because she suggested something. A simple \"we'll think about it\" or something would suffice in this situation", "If it is actually about the cost, then she needs to say so directly. Then have a conversation about re-evaluating the budget and budget distribution.\n\nIf it's about stress of scaling up to a larger wedding, then she should say so and ask OP to take more of a role in planning than he already is.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's either of those. I suspect she's either getting cold feet, and is lashing out instead of doing a runner OR she's got a very specific vision of the wedding in mind and is lashing out at anyone that suggests anything that goes against it.\n\nShe lashed out at her own mom over mom suggesting a possible venue.\n\nI also note that OP said she set the size of the guest list. And said in a way that suggests this was set unilaterally and not as a budget matter either.
