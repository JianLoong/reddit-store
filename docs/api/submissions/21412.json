How many people you invite should be based on cost and comfort. If you want more people because you have a bigger family, that is very valid. If there was a cost concern, then of course you can't just add people, and if there is a venue issues, you work it out. She doesn't get to unilaterally decide what size wedding she wants, her objections have to be based in other factors (cost and space). \n\nAnd her attitude in general is bad. You shouldn't be getting middle of the night meltdowns, be afraid to make suggestions, and have entire days ruined because someone had an idea. This is alarming behavior, because you have to wonder if it is about a wedding, or if this is how she is around planning in general or big events, or big life moments. Buying a house could trigger this same kind of behavior, having kids, raising kids, kids getting in trouble, money issues, health emergencies, moving...there are going to be 25-50 major moments in your lives that will be bigger deals than your wedding, without the time and and joy that a wedding also brings. How is she going to handle those? \n\nYou have to talk to her, and definitely push out wedding planning at the very least.", "NTA, at least wait another year to start planning and all that, and definitely reconsider the relationship altogether.

It doesn't matter how stressful wedding planning is or how long she's been planning her dream wedding.", "I don\u2019t think you would be the AH for doing that, but it wouldn\u2019t be helpful. She seems like a person who handles stress extremely poorly. Pushing the wedding back would just annoy her more and would mean that she would stress about it the same way once it came back around.\n\nYou need to communicate with her that she is so poorly handling her stress with the wedding that it is becoming unbearable to work with her on planning it. She could realize that and improve, or she could brush off the issue and keep up the poor stress management and lashing out; if she does the latter I think the wedding should be called off until you both can manage the stress of a big life event well together. \n\nBut you should bring up your issue with her stress management and give her a chance to work on that first before shutting everything down.", "NTA.\n\nBut you should put off the wedding.

In all honesty you should be glad she's showing you this now instead of after there are legal ties between you.

The appropriate response would be \u201cI\u2019m not sure we can afford to have everybody there,  it lets look at the budget and see if we can make it work\u201d.", "Had to scroll this far to see a practical mind. This is it. Weddings last a day or two. Debt stretches on for months, years\u2026.", "Screaming at OP because of it though is what makes her an asshole.  She also blew up at her mother for finding a venue and saying \"hey this might be someplace you might like\".  Girl is going nuts.", "Nope, 75% of wedding paid by his parents. 25% her.", "From the way she reacted to her mother\u2019s venue suggestion, I\u2019d say the bride is controlling the planning with an iron fist. I mean, if her own mother can\u2019t even make suggestions?", "I guess you didn't see the last where he mentions that any suggestions is met its histrionics.", "Seriously? Did you even read It?

She\u2019s being an AH.\n\nI did the vast majority of the planning for our wedding. I happen to have the knack for event planning/juggling moving parts, and I still found it quite stressful. I never once blew up at my (now) husband over it.\n\nI think that\u2019s because I realized the marriage was much more important than a party. If you\u2019re not mature enough to figure that out, you shouldn\u2019t get married.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that there\u2019s missing context, ie: OP might expect their fianc\u00e9e to take on the entire mental load and do all the planning while they\u2019re acting like mommy\u2019s helper instead of an equal partner with agency.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then E S H.

Just curious. I read it a bit like they were trying to offer suggestions.", "75% will be covered by my parents, 25% from here", "The only AH is the fianc\u00e9. Op is far from the AH. He\u2019s probably tried to help but ms psycho probably won\u2019t have it", "NTA. HIS family is paying for most of the wedding, she\u2019s just the one yelling because everything is not going her way.

The party can be really awesome and create lifelong memories. But money is likely tight if the whole thing is being paid for by a roughly 22-year-old with a just out of college salary.

And that does seem unhinged. \n\nAs for the reception place, you don't choose a place for your reception when you don't know how many people you're inviting. An overreaction, sure, but we don't know what all was said during this conversation or implied about the number of people. Or how much the mother has been inserting herself in the planning. \n\nWeddings are stressful and you're usually trying to please a lot of people.", "25% of a big wedding is a LOT for a young, just-graduated working professional.", "Jesus, just her? Cuz weddings are expensive af so 25% will still be a lot, especially if they invite even more people and have an expensive venue.\n\nI swear its all teens on here who dont understand adult relationships and dont understand money", "Giving \"suggestions\" isn't actually helpful though if you're not expecting to do any of the work to do those things.       \n\nIf you're doing a task and someone's looking over your shoulder, adding more things and critiquing, that's not something most people would appreciate.         \nHe doesn't mention doing or offering to do any of the legwork involved in planning a big event. \n\nShe obviously is TA for freaking out, but if she's doing it all alone and all he's doing is adding more things to her plate, then that's pretty unsupportive and frustrating, too.       \n\nThey definitely aren't ready to get married.", "The commenter is asking. It's a valid question.", "Is she stressed at the extra cost of a much bigger wedding than she budgeted for? 25% could still be alot if she's the only one working full time?", "The actual budget is fixed, right? Are you talking 50 people at a restaurant for a nice dinner vs. 250 people at a potluck at the park or something? Push the wedding until you either break up or you can contribute, too.", "WAIT!!!!  You're parents are covering 75% of the wedding and she's not letting you invite some of your family.. Seriously?  You need to push back the wedding date and insist on some premarital counselling before setting a new date.  Keep in mind potential spouses are on their BEST behavior pre-wedding.  You're already afraid of her temper and walking on eggshells--- it will get far worse over time.", "If you can't talk to her then you can't possibly marry her.\n\nIt is 1,000x better she blows a fuse than you marry her at this point.\n\nYeah, wedding planning is stressful, but not this stressful. \n\nMarriage has a lot of stress that is REAL and has impacts. You have been dating for a long time, but how much actual real-world stress have you gone through? How many difficult decisions have you had to make together where compromise was required from both of you. I'm not talking finals week stress or I have a bad roommate stress, or I have to change plans b/c of a work emergency. I'm talking the kind where you don't have a safty net to fall back on and really hard choices have to be made? \n\nRight now, you GF is failing this stress test miserably and you are too worried about making her mad than confronting her about it, which means you are failing the test too.", "It isn't going to be easier if you get married and she continues to blow up every time something doesn't go her way", "Oh no, her response to simmering she doesn't like is to blow a fuse? You seriously need to rethink & postpone the wedding seems like the wedding is the most important thing.", "Marriage is (theoretically) forever. \n\nIf her response to discussing issues is to blow up at everything, do you want to spend the rest of your life walking on eggshells?\n\nPerhaps this **is** just overstress from planning. But you need to have a conversation about that, and how this is not an acceptable way to work out conflict in a long term relationship. If those closest to her cannot assure you that this is an uncharacteristic behavior for her, I would think you should table the weddding planning for a while. NTA", "Let her blow a fuse then. Better a fuse than your life.", "She probably will but if she acts this unreasonably over a 1 day party, imagine what she'll be like when real life stress happens. Her method of handling \"challenges\" seems to be to bulldoze over everyone in her path; she needs to grow up a bit. Better to pump the brakes now and gain some perspective,  for both of you.", "It sounds like she's blowing fuses already. And it doesn't sound like she's enjoying the experience - maybe she would benefit from a break so you can tackle the planning at a later point. But marrying someone fast because they'd explode if you didn't, really isn't the way to get married.", "She's already blown a bunch. What's one more fuse on the pile?", "It sounds like a good idea though, waiting until after you\u2019ve graduated too.  It\u2019ll also give you more time to see if other stressful things will turn her into a harpy again", "Yeah man, take it from someone (35M) who\u2019s currently planning a wedding for next year - this isn\u2019t normal or healthy. It would be one thing if she was always like this and you accepted it. \n\n It\u2019s another thing entirely to be seeing a side of the person you are about to marry in one years\u2019 time that you\u2019ve never seen before. From everything you\u2019ve said here, you aren\u2019t ready to be married. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to ever rush a wedding, I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s such a trend with people. \n\nIt changes nothing in a relationship.

Don\u2019t marry her yet, for your own sanity.", "Don't get married to avoid a fight!", "You can\u2019t be afraid of her blowing a fuse. The alternative is doing exactly what she wants and not having an opinion for the rest of your life. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not what you want.", "That's a reason to do it, not to avoid it. If you can't propose a completely rational plan without her getting angry, you're in a toxic relationship and need to NOT GET MARRIED.", "Would you rather she blow a fuse later on down the line when you potentially come to the realization that marrying her was a mistake and you ask for a divorce, then need to hire a lawyer so that you two can figure out how to split money, home, car, custody if you have kids, alimony if it's required and child support?\n\nOr do you think maybe her blowing a fuse now before you waste potentially thousands of dollars on a wedding that will potentially end in divorce, then have to waste hundreds more dollars on divorce lawyers, and if you want kids only getting to have them half the time (more or less depending on custody)?", "Why the fuck are you trying to have your first failed marriage before you even graduate.   Wait a few years", "OP just posted his family is covering 75% of the wedding, so that makes the bride\u2019s behaviour even worse.", "Yes of course. I loved my micro budget wedding! Point is though that we leveraged all of our contacts and favours, and luckily knew some aspiring fashion school kid to see the dress etc etc. The financial agony of it is real, but 30 years later we\u2019re still together and looking at the great photos (by our friend who was aspiring pro photographer). So yes it\u2019s important", "And, of course, the very best way to express that is by screaming and swearing at her mother and her fiance.", "Sure\u2014that doesn\u2019t excuse her yelling and swearing at her fianc\u00e9. Who wants to marry someone like that?", "Right.  Also some people don't want 200 people staring at them all night. Also,  this was done over text message. Was she really screaming? Or was she being direct? Also,  what's her relationship with her mother like? My mom's suggestions on most things in my life cause me to clench my fists. Growing up in constant judgement creates some interesting dynamics between mothers and daughters. They both sound too immature to be getting married. Call it off, but let's not with the name calling and pointing fingers", "Omg 1000% this.  My husband broke his leg and has not been able to help around the house. I work full time and I try to keep up with everything.  I'm doing my best.  But,  he's always making comments like \"the stairs need to be vacuumed\" etc. I fucking know the stairs need to be vacuumed. I literally just finished walking the dog and am about to start dinner,  that comment isn't helpful. I flipped out at him after about 4 weeks of these stupid comments and this dumb man still doesn't understand how him micromanaging me while he does fucking nothing is irritating as hell. Anyway,  my point being,  it's a stressful situation for all involved,  and my fuse is way shorter than it's ever been in my decade of marriage to him. And rightfully so.", "Then the commenter should have asked for more info before making a judgment. She is not funding the entire thing, his parents are paying for 75% and they are paying the rest.", "Even if she is funding everything herself that is no excuse to treat OP and even her own mother this way.", "She's showing her true colors now.", "Well I mean if she\u2019s swearing at her fianc\u00e9 that pushes her more into the ah category than just immature.", "Sounds like *she* is paying the rest.", "That's why I judged ESH. At this point, postponing the wedding until they are both financially stable enough to fund everything they both want might be the best option.", "There's swearing, and there's swearing at. If she said \"You're an asshole,\" then yeah, she swore at him. If she said \"I don't want this fucking wedding,\" that's not *at* him."]}
