How many people you invite should be based on cost and comfort. If you want more people because you have a bigger family, that is very valid. If there was a cost concern, then of course you can't just add people, and if there is a venue issues, you work it out. She doesn't get to unilaterally decide what size wedding she wants, her objections have to be based in other factors (cost and space). \n\nAnd her attitude in general is bad. You shouldn't be getting middle of the night meltdowns, be afraid to make suggestions, and have entire days ruined because someone had an idea. This is alarming behavior, because you have to wonder if it is about a wedding, or if this is how she is around planning in general or big events, or big life moments. Buying a house could trigger this same kind of behavior, having kids, raising kids, kids getting in trouble, money issues, health emergencies, moving...there are going to be 25-50 major moments in your lives that will be bigger deals than your wedding, without the time and and joy that a wedding also brings. How is she going to handle those? \n\nYou have to talk to her, and definitely push out wedding planning at the very least.", "NTA, at least wait another year to start planning and all that, and definitely reconsider the relationship altogether.

She seems like a person who handles stress extremely poorly. Pushing the wedding back would just annoy her more and would mean that she would stress about it the same way once it came back around.\n\nYou need to communicate with her that she is so poorly handling her stress with the wedding that it is becoming unbearable to work with her on planning it. She could realize that and improve, or she could brush off the issue and keep up the poor stress management and lashing out; if she does the latter I think the wedding should be called off until you both can manage the stress of a big life event well together. \n\nBut you should bring up your issue with her stress management and give her a chance to work on that first before shutting everything down.", "NTA.\n\nBut you should put off the wedding.

In all honesty you should be glad she's showing you this now instead of after there are legal ties between you.

How much of this is she doing completely on her own without your opinions being taken into consideration? This seems to be a very volatile situation in which y'all are proved to not be compatible. A wedding is about both of you, not just her.
