It especially hurt because they knew he came from a toxic ex-wife who cheated on him more than 10X\u2019s. He is my best friend and healed wounds another created. It\u2019s the best relationship I could be in. He never hesitated with his trust towards me but I still worried. He believed me and knew they just did it to hurt me. He would do everything for me and vice versa. They tried to attack me every chance they got by sly comments and calling me lazy because (since we lived with my parents to help my parents with bills) my moms house was not always clean even though my nephews (there sons) lived there too. After that accusation of cheating incident and my brother in law telling me to leave my parents home (even though he doesn\u2019t live there) I cut my family off for good after falling into depression hard due to their bullying. They even once said to someone \u201cshe should just un-alive herself and get it over with if she\u2019s that depressed and stop being so dramatic\u201d which hurt me so bad. We moved away and are living the most positive life ever with our 3girls. My mother had a stroke 5yrs later and it brought us sisters to talking again, but I still have my guard up and my husband protects me 100% by making sure I stay positive and reassures me we don\u2019t need my sisters. \n\nI cry for a relationship with my sisters sometimes but I understand it is what it is. They go to the gym together and dinner but never invite me. Things will never be the same because the damage was just too great that some wounds cannot be healed. So I am there to help with my mom but things will never be the same again. NOW! I\u2019m pregnant and this is what we have always wanted because our girls are from prior toxic marriages. Now my sisters want me more into the holidays with them. Going to the home, presents, barbecues etc. but I\u2019m just not comfortable being close yet. I make up excuses every time by saying we have other plans or whatever. Especially when one of the problems was them singling my stepdaughter out in the past and I noticed they still do it. Like again they want us there for Christmas but no presents are for my stepdaughter. To not single her out I\u2019m avoiding the issue but they keep persisting. \n\nI\u2019m caught in the middle thinking this might be my parents last holiday with us all together but I\u2019m just to anxious to be around them. I don\u2019t want to be attacked and I feel like I walk on eggshells just being near them. My husband is saying \u201chell no!\u201d I\u2019m not going but I guess deep down inside of me I do want things to be normal.

Why would you do that to your family?\n\nAlso your sisters are likely setting you up for their next cruelty(what do you think they will do as a second act if the first was to try to convince your husband that you were cheating on him?  Will they try to convince him your fetus isn't his??)", "Nta. Protect yourself and your family. Family isn't always blood. I wouldn't give them the opportunity to hurt me or my SO and kids. They burned that bridge.", "I'm sorry you have been going through this for years. Please give yourself time to grieve and process the emotional impact. \n\nSometimes I make decisions based on the question, \"Will I regret if I do/don't do xyz?\" But in this case, you can maybe reframe any future regret by reminding yourself that you did the best that you could at that moment in time. This loops back to forgiving yourself and not going down the rabbit hole of shoulda/coulda/woulda.\n\nOnce you become a parent, the question that could help you most is, \"What's the healthiest choice for my child/children?\" That often narrows down the field considerably.

(He is bi polar alcoholic and refuses medication/treatment.   This was during one of his Manic episodes.  He cut contact with one sister over a perceived situation,  while the other sister cut him off after years of dealing with his Manic episodes.) \n\nMy husband and I live 5 hours from them.  We always go up for Christmas and celebrate as a family.  \n\nI was on the fence about asking them to please put all their differences aside for a few hours to celebrate Christmas,  or celebrate my son and family, then celebrate with my daughters.  \n\nWe decided on separate visits. The tension.  The 'fakeness'. Everyone is walking on eggshells so as not to accidentally set someone off. The uneasiness. The grandkids picking up on all the tension.  We just didn't want to force everyone together for the sake of some Big Happy Family illusion.  \n\nI'm not sure how involved your Parents are in all of this,  but they may very well be relieved to have a truly genuine, happy celebration, separate,  from all the tension amongst their children.", "NTA. Invite your parents to a Christmas with you. No sisters. Don't fall for their bs. Even if it's not on Christmas,  just have a Christmas with your family and your parents.", "Yes exactly. Thank you for seeing it the way I see it", "You have a great point. Yes I have been apart from my family because my parents do nothing about it. They state that it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want the drama while literally watching me suffer. I would never do that to my kids. I don\u2019t care what bridges I burn but my kids deserve respect. But when danger or they need help I\u2019m their first call, I guess that keeps me holding on worried when they might need me, but your right it might be just to prepare me for the next bullying phase", "Thank you so much", "My parents don\u2019t want to get involved and I would\u2019ve loved doing the whole \u201cone year Christmas/thanksgiving with one and another Christmas/thanksgiving with another\u201d but never have come to any of my invites in the 5yrs of my silence with my sisters. Even now that we\u2019re talking again. I\u2019m obviously not the child they wanted", "They won\u2019t come. I\u2019ve invited my parents over for every holiday and they never come.

We'll celebrate Christmas with you then. What can we bring?\"", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. It\u2019s not easy knowing your family who is supposed to be your \u201cride or die\u201d is your worst enemy.
