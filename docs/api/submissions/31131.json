This really upset my mother and resulted in a family argument. I was a little upset by her decision but chose to hide my opinion from her. I told her it was her day and she can make the decisions. I will be there to help and support my sister on her wedding day whether I\u2019m wearing a bridesmaids dress or not. \n\nShe is having 6 of her friends be bridesmaids. In an attempt to appease my mother, the bride asked me and my other sister to be \u201cher something blue.\u201d I was very confused by this, as she presented us with a gift, similar to how you would typically ask your bridal party. She wants us to wear matching blue dresses to the wedding but not participate in the ceremony.  I\u2019m worried that guests are going to think my sister and I are upset about not being bridesmaids so we secretly went and bought our own matching dresses.  The bridal party will be wearing maroon. \n\nThe bride is expecting me and my other sister to contribute our time and contribute financially to throw a wedding shower, bachelorette party, and help with the day of the wedding. I also watch the brides children regularly for free while she goes to work. She doesn\u2019t owe me anything for the free child care because I love spending time with my nieces and I want them to have a safe place to go. \n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t make sense that I am the first one she calls when she needs help or a babysitter, but I\u2019m not in her top 6 people to stand next to her on one of the most important days of her life. She trusts me every week to keep her kids safe/alive but not stand next to her on the alter? \n\nIf I can\u2019t be a bridesmaid, I would rather just be a regular guest and not have to wear a matching/expensive dress. \n\nIf I am not in the wedding, why am I obligated to do the traditional bridal party duties? I don\u2019t want to pay for or help with anything related to the wedding. I don\u2019t want to wear a matching blue dress. \n\nAm I the asshole?

I\u2019m offended for you that she excluded you even though she 1. Is your sister, 2. has you watch her kids for free 3. expects you to not only contribute your time and money to the wedding but then buy a dress you don\u2019t want to wear on top of that?? WOW. She already excluded you so you should absolutely put your foot down and tell her you\u2019re going to act just like any other guest since you\u2019ve been downgraded to one. When she asks for financial help and help with planning, say \u201cthat\u2019s what your bridesmaids are for and last I check, I\u2019m not one of them\u201d", "Mic drop. This is exactly the approach I would take.", "Cue the \u201cBUT ITS MY SPECIAL DAY\u201d outburst", "NTA. Decline all of it. Why are you expected to throw all of the parties if you\u2019re not In the wedding party? That\u2019d be a hard pass from me. You don\u2019t want me, but you want my money and time? Nope", "NTA. I'm sorry, but your sister is using you. People who plan parties they're not a part of are called party planners, and they get paid to do it. People who look after children outside of school are called babysitters or nannies, and they get paid to do it. \n\nThe something blue idea is just weird, and people will assume you and your other sister are upset and desperate to be in the bridal party.\n\nDon't be grateful for the scraps she's throwing at you. Say no to anything other than just being a regular guest - no planning or paying for the bachelorette or wedding shower, no showing up early/staying late on the day to help out.", "NTA. Your sister is trying to have it both ways. She doesn't want you as bridesmaids but wants your money. No.\n\nFirst, she doesn't get to tell you you're hosting a bridal shower; whoever offers, host it. You fidnt offer.\n\nSecond, MoH and bridesmaids organize the Bachelorette, which each woman pays her portion of and they split the brides portion. It's not a hosted event.\n\nThird, you're not her indentured servants for her to dictate that you're the help the day of the wedding.\n\nDon't be her something blue.", "NTA\n\nTell her that as a guest you will wear a dress if your own choosing - one which you find suitable to wear on other occasions. \n\nAnd when she asks for help with bridal party stuff - just redirect it to her bridal party. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be texting X about that? She\u2019s your MOH\u201d. \n\nShe has a large bridal party. Her sisters shouldn\u2019t be doing the work of the bridal party.", "NTA and fuuuu*k that lol what a cop out of her.", "NTA.\n\nMatching \"something blue\" dresses is cringe as fuck. No way.", "I always thought that the \"something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\" was about items that the bride was wearing herself.\n\nNTA.", "She's trying to have her cake and eat it,  too. You're not bridesmaid material but please fork over the cash and be at my beck and call as a babysitter.  Yeah, no. \n\nNTA \u0253ut make she understands you will just be a regular guess.  What does your other sister think?", "NTA silly dresses are worn by the bridal party not the guests", "NTA. She isn't really including you other than on the ordinary wedding guest level.  She is throwing you a crumb by suggesting you wear matching blue dresses. Why should you and your other sister contribute anything timewise or financially when you are not in the bridal party? She should ask her MOH and her bridesmaids to do this.", "You\u2019re NTA necessarily but if you really just want your sister to be happy on her day what\u2019s the harm in wearing a blue dress if it\u2019s what will make her happy? I think you should have another convo with her before it becomes a bigger issue, if you are as close as you say then you should have no problem asking her why you aren\u2019t part of the bridal party and how you have all the same responsibilities so it doesn\u2019t make sense to you. Clear and honest communication is best, don\u2019t just be mad and expect her to read your mind she may have no idea your upset about this. Give her a chance to fix it.\n\nEdit: It may be an aesthetic thing if her hubby has 6 groomsmen and can\u2019t find two more maybe she knows you as her sister love her and won\u2019t be mad if not included as a \u201cbridesmaid\u201d where her friends may be more sensitive if they were to be not included. Sister relationships are complex I just don\u2019t want you to tarnish your relationship over this if it may be a misunderstanding.", "NTA.  I googled it and the  blue crew is a new wedding trend.   I would ask to be a regular guest.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur mom is the biggest AH for causing drama.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"If I can\u2019t be a bridesmaid, I would rather just be a regular guest and not have to wear a matching/expensive dress.\" ... this is reasonable. Don't contribute financially, and step back from helping. Her bridesmaids can help.", "NTA- OP, I hope she takes your very reasonable answer of No, I don't wish to be Blue. There is zero reason for you or your Sister to PAY for anything other than a Wedding Gift. The 6 she chose to stand up for her are the ones to give a Bridal Shower and her Bachelorette Party, NOT you and your other sister. That's a Money Grab.  Good Luck!", ">If I am not in the wedding, why am I obligated to do the traditional bridal party duties? \n\nYou're not. You and your sister should tell her No. Don't pay for anything, don't organize anything, don't buy matching dresses and just attend as a regular guest. \n\nWhen she and/or your Mom throws a fit, ignore.\n\nYou're fully aware that she's not trying to include you, right? She's trying to get your Mom off her ass about not having you guys as bridesmaids.\n\nNTA", "NTA while it\u2019s not uncommon for family of the bride to help with the bridal shower and perhaps some on the day it sounds like her expectations go beyond that. It also seems clear the \u201csomething blue\u201d offer is just to appease mother and not genuine. I\u2019d decline and just support as a regular guest and offer to color coordinate for any family pictures.", "NTA. Seems like she\u2019s using you and your sis to bankroll the bridesmaids\u2019 usual expenses and duties\u2026", "That's perfect. \n\nI'd stress the \"regular guest\" part because I wouldn't be contributing to her shower and bachelorette party either. I'd be showing up at whatever I was invited to as a regular guest (ie: with a gift for the shower)", "Also, in the tradition of the something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, those things are supposed to go down the aisle with the bride, which would not be happening in this case", "To be fair, you can help and support at the wedding without having to pay for the woman's bachelorette party or wedding shower. You can just be there and help run errands etc. but why the hell you'd need to when the woman has SIX (what a ridiculously large number!) bridesmaids to do her bidding is beyond me!", "Yep. I initially had \"support you in any way that you need me to\" but figured that opened up \"please pay for my hen's night\" requests so I pared it back :)", "Exactly! I would also be dropping hints that when it comes to any showers, Bachelorette parties, or whatever else they decide the financial burden falls onto her picked 6.", "I once went to a wedding where there were 10 bridesmaids"]}
