One of my sisters is getting married in 6 months, to the father of her 2 young children. \n\nAt a recent family dinner, the bride informed me and my other sister that we were not going to be bridesmaids. This really upset my mother and resulted in a family argument. I was a little upset by her decision but chose to hide my opinion from her. I told her it was her day and she can make the decisions. I will be there to help and support my sister on her wedding day whether I\u2019m wearing a bridesmaids dress or not. \n\nShe is having 6 of her friends be bridesmaids. In an attempt to appease my mother, the bride asked me and my other sister to be \u201cher something blue.\u201d I was very confused by this, as she presented us with a gift, similar to how you would typically ask your bridal party. She wants us to wear matching blue dresses to the wedding but not participate in the ceremony.  I\u2019m worried that guests are going to think my sister and I are upset about not being bridesmaids so we secretly went and bought our own matching dresses.  The bridal party will be wearing maroon. \n\nThe bride is expecting me and my other sister to contribute our time and contribute financially to throw a wedding shower, bachelorette party, and help with the day of the wedding. I also watch the brides children regularly for free while she goes to work. She doesn\u2019t owe me anything for the free child care because I love spending time with my nieces and I want them to have a safe place to go. \n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t make sense that I am the first one she calls when she needs help or a babysitter, but I\u2019m not in her top 6 people to stand next to her on one of the most important days of her life. She trusts me every week to keep her kids safe/alive but not stand next to her on the alter? \n\nIf I can\u2019t be a bridesmaid, I would rather just be a regular guest and not have to wear a matching/expensive dress. \n\nIf I am not in the wedding, why am I obligated to do the traditional bridal party duties? I don\u2019t want to pay for or help with anything related to the wedding. I don\u2019t want to wear a matching blue dress. \n\nAm I the asshole?
