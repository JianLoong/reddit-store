Your sister was understandably terrified.\n\nI'd be very concerned about a 7 year old that could plan and execute such a thing, especially saying that she needs to be quite if she wants to 'escape the demons'. That's not normal.

These people would never be in my home again. Nope nope nope. Get that girl in therapy and send Auntie the bill.", "NTA.  My hackles were rising at \"boys will be boys.\"  Your little cousin sounds psychotic.  I would tell all the relatives who say you are overreacting to allow you to lock them in a closet and see how they like it.\n\nGood on you for standing up for your sister.", "NTA\n\nFuck respecting her son. She's a shitty parent who lets him bully other kids.\n\nNobody needs bullies like that. If she was a decent parent she'd see that he needs pulling into line.", "NTA- The brat had what was coming to him, and honestly with that kind of behavior I'm surprised there's no mention of incidents at school.", "SOOOOO NTA!  My parents had friends with a son who was about my age - I was about 7 or 8 at the time, and he was around 10.  It was expected that I would play with him when his idea of \"playing\" was for us to \"pretend to be cats\" and attack me, then hold me down and touch me between my legs and on my chest, saying he was scratching me with his \"claws.\" until I cried for him to get off. He would then tell me not to say anything, and that no one would believe me if I did. It took me YEARS of therapy to get over that - that I didn't start getting until I was in my 40s - especially since I had been dealing with another incident of molestation by another family friend at around the same time. Thankfully the visits stopped when the other party moved, but that attitude of \"boys will be boys\" is the reason why I spent so much of my childhood miserable.  Those types of actions need to be nipped in the bud IMMEDIATELY, and I hope your sister is in therapy now too for trauma counseling.  \n\nI still can't believe we're dealing with this \"boys will be boys\" attitude in 2023.  Jesus F-ing Christ.", "Should you have handled it differently? Maybe.\n\nDid you handle it about as well as you could have in the moment? I\u2019d say yes, particularly since neither your cousin nor aunt ended up locked inside any rooms or pieces of furniture. \n\nI\u2019m really glad your parents took your side and told your aunt she\u2019s not welcome. Maybe your cousin\u2019s just a little shit, and maybe he\u2019ll grow out of it one day (I\u2019d not feel too confident in that if he\u2019s mommy\u2019s precious angel face that can do no wrong), but it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s any positives that come from spending time around them in the present.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA. Your little cousin's actions were inexcusable and your aunt was wrong to enable it. Your reaction was understandable considering the situation and you were right to protect your sister. It's a parent's job to protect their children, and you did just that. Kudos for standing up for your little sister.", "NTA.  Your aunt and cousin are horrible.  The fact that your sister now has to sleep with either you or your parents shows she is far from okay with what happened.  Good job banning them from the house and kudos to your parents for backing you up.", "Nta. He locked her in a cupboard. At 7 I'd hope they atleast know that's wrong. The fact he told her to stay quiet from demons makes it sound like he knows. \nYour aunt should be held accountable as I'm sure if the shoe was on the other foot and it was her child she'd be furious", "Totally NTA. \n\nYour cousin has mildly traumatised your sister. What happens to your family at your home is only fair for you to choose how to handle.

You're the HERO.", "Absolutely NTA. Although if it had been me, after rescuing the 4yo, it might have played out a little differently: I *most likely* would have grabbed the 7yo & gave him a dose of his own \"medicine\" by shoving him into the cabinet even though I wouldn't have left him over a minute or two. Actions have consequences & the best way to learn that is to experience the feelings caused by those actions.", "NTA.. I would have spanked that kid.  The seven year old knows better than to do that to someone smaller than him that's the problem he's never had his butt spanked\n\n\nAnd before people go off on me I did have my butt  spanked as a child and I've turned out fine there's a difference in between giving a spanking and then doing harm", "Unless someone is on fire, screaming needs to be off the table. And from your description it sounds like screaming *might* be a thing with your family. Make a break with that. You\u2019re not an ah, but screaming at a 7yo is no bueno and will teach him to be someone who screams instead of communicating. Your aunt should have been supervising both children if she was the only adult home. She\u2019s the one to be angry with.

It\u2019s not a black and white circumstance in that this kid just needs his mom to say \u201chey, that\u2019s not nice be a better person\u201d one time and magically everything is resolved. It would be smart to intervene and do something sooner rather than later. There could be a lot more going on. A child\u2019s bad behavior isn\u2019t always just some product of shit parenting. \n\nThe goal/reason for therapy would be more to find out WHY he\u2019s doing this,  whats causing this, etc. and then go from there. It can also be helpful for the parents too. \n\nThere\u2019s really no harm in it tbh. It should absolutely be checked out by a professional. If he\u2019s acting out because his mother enables him, therapy would still be a great resource. Has nothing to do with being a \u201creplacement for parenting\u201d.", "Even when the little kid is literally torturing another (you'rye) child?", "This isn't a \"hands off parent\" situation though. This is an \"actively encouraging their kid to be awful\" one. And until and unless that changes no amount of therapy is going to make that kid normal while he remains in that environment.", "I don\u2019t think every child of a \u201chands off\u201d parent acts like this\u2026 but I think he exemplifies a child of permissive parents, who not only do not set boundaries but actively tear other boundaries down for their child\u2019s whimsy. \n\nLittle dude was bred with entitlement and frankly, it\u2019s would have been more surprising  if he hadn\u2019t ended up like this. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing a therapist can do to help if the parenting environment is one that lacks empathy for others, disregards boundaries and doesn\u2019t teach her son the concept of repercussions.", "Even every time. Don't scream at children. It helps nothing at all.\n\nYou don't have to scream to show displeasure or control a situation."]}
