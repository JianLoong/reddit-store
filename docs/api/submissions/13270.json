My parents had him pretty late (it was an accidental pregnancy), but we still love her. I\u2019ve always wanted a little sibling, and having her around is the best gift in the world. I\u2019m pretty protective of my sister.\n\nLast Tuesday, my aunt came over with her son. He\u2019s 7. my cousin is very entitled, and my aunt enables it by saying boys will be boys. My dad was working that day, and my mum had gone out to run some errands after my aunt offered to watch over the kids. \n\nI was out with my bf, but we decided to stop at my home to collect something. as I walked in, I couldn\u2019t find my little sister. I assumed she was in her room sleeping and greeted my aunt, and walked to my room. \n\nI walked past my little sister's room but couldn\u2019t find her there. I knew she was home because my mum had texted me. So I started panicking. I ran down to ask my aunt, and she said, \u201coh, she\u2019s probably playing somewhere with your cousin\u201d. I couldn\u2019t find him anywhere, but my bf heard sounds from the basement, and we found him there. \n\nHe was playing on his mum's phone and was giggling weirdly. I calmly asked him for my little sister, but he kept laughing. This is where I lost control. I screamed at him and asked him where my sister was. He got freaked out and started crying. \n\nHe pointed at the cupboard, and when I unlocked it, my little sister was in there crying silently because that little mtfker had locked her in and told her not to make a sound if she wanted to escape the demons. Obviously, any 4 yr old would be terrified. So I went off on my cousin, and my aunt heard this and came down. I ripped her a huge one, and she called me dramatic.\n\nI demanded her son apologise, but she told me to respect her son and that he was playing around. So I kicked them out of the house and banned them from ever coming again. \n\nMy mum arrived a few minutes later and was pissed after discovering what had happened. my parents screamed at my aunt and told her never to show up again. \n\nMy sister is doing well now. She\u2019s scared to sleep alone, so she sleeps with my parents or me. My grandparents heard about this and thought we overreacted because my cousin was just playing.

Your sister was understandably terrified.\n\nI'd be very concerned about a 7 year old that could plan and execute such a thing, especially saying that she needs to be quite if she wants to 'escape the demons'. That's not normal. I'd be worried about what he's exposed to if he can come out with that.\n\nSeems like the poor kid needs a whole lot of therapy!", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s really creepy\u2026the kid is only seven and he\u2019s that much of a sadist?\n\nYour sister is lucky to have you and I\u2019m glad your parents stood up for you both.", "NTA\n\nMercy, I truly hope your sister is ok. A loved one of mine was in similar circumstances as a child. He's severely  claustrophobic to this day.\n\nTo all those boys will be boys ahs, feel free to mention serial killers often display the same behavior. Have any cats disappeared from the neighborhood?", "NTA--- \"boys will be boys \" is how you end up with irresponsible, abusive men.", "NTA. These people would never be in my home again. Nope nope nope. Get that girl in therapy and send Auntie the bill.", "NTA.  My hackles were rising at \"boys will be boys.\"  Your little cousin sounds psychotic.  I would tell all the relatives who say you are overreacting to allow you to lock them in a closet and see how they like it.\n\nGood on you for standing up for your sister.", "NTA\n\nFuck respecting her son. She's a shitty parent who lets him bully other kids.\n\nNobody needs bullies like that. If she was a decent parent she'd see that he needs pulling into line.", "NTA- The brat had what was coming to him, and honestly with that kind of behavior I'm surprised there's no mention of incidents at school.", "SOOOOO NTA!  My parents had friends with a son who was about my age - I was about 7 or 8 at the time, and he was around 10.  It was expected that I would play with him when his idea of \"playing\" was for us to \"pretend to be cats\" and attack me, then hold me down and touch me between my legs and on my chest, saying he was scratching me with his \"claws.\" until I cried for him to get off. He would then tell me not to say anything, and that no one would believe me if I did. It took me YEARS of therapy to get over that - that I didn't start getting until I was in my 40s - especially since I had been dealing with another incident of molestation by another family friend at around the same time. Thankfully the visits stopped when the other party moved, but that attitude of \"boys will be boys\" is the reason why I spent so much of my childhood miserable.  Those types of actions need to be nipped in the bud IMMEDIATELY, and I hope your sister is in therapy now too for trauma counseling.  \n\nI still can't believe we're dealing with this \"boys will be boys\" attitude in 2023.  Jesus F-ing Christ.", "Should you have handled it differently? Maybe.\n\nDid you handle it about as well as you could have in the moment? I\u2019d say yes, particularly since neither your cousin nor aunt ended up locked inside any rooms or pieces of furniture. \n\nI\u2019m really glad your parents took your side and told your aunt she\u2019s not welcome. Maybe your cousin\u2019s just a little shit, and maybe he\u2019ll grow out of it one day (I\u2019d not feel too confident in that if he\u2019s mommy\u2019s precious angel face that can do no wrong), but it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s any positives that come from spending time around them in the present.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA. Your little cousin's actions were inexcusable and your aunt was wrong to enable it. Your reaction was understandable considering the situation and you were right to protect your sister. It's a parent's job to protect their children, and you did just that. Kudos for standing up for your little sister.", "NTA.  Your aunt and cousin are horrible.  The fact that your sister now has to sleep with either you or your parents shows she is far from okay with what happened.  Good job banning them from the house and kudos to your parents for backing you up.", "Nta. He locked her in a cupboard. At 7 I'd hope they atleast know that's wrong. The fact he told her to stay quiet from demons makes it sound like he knows. \nYour aunt should be held accountable as I'm sure if the shoe was on the other foot and it was her child she'd be furious", "Totally NTA. \n\nYour cousin has mildly traumatised your sister. What happens to your family at your home is only fair for you to choose how to handle. Great shoutout to your parents for understanding your side!", "Of course you're NTA.  \n\nNephew was giggling about locking his younger cousin in a closet.    Bully, and who know what pathologies he is going to be diagnosed with in the future.", "NTA. This is how children die.  She could have suffocated or 100 other things.  This wasn't a prank.", "NTA.", " NTA !", "NTA \n\nHonestly the aunt would have copped a slap from me after being told to respect her entitled brat.", "NTA anyone would of called the police", "NTA. Anyone saying YTA has something wrong with them. The girl was locked in a cupboard for crying out loud, had she been in there any longer she could have died by suffocation!", "NTA. And you\u2019re a good big sister", "NTA. If grandparents think you all are being \"overdramatic\", then maybe they shouldn't be allowed near your sister either since they apparently think it is fine for your monster of a cousin to do that to your 4 year old little sister with no punishment.", "You're NTA. You're the HERO.", "Absolutely NTA. Although if it had been me, after rescuing the 4yo, it might have played out a little differently: I *most likely* would have grabbed the 7yo & gave him a dose of his own \"medicine\" by shoving him into the cabinet even though I wouldn't have left him over a minute or two. Actions have consequences & the best way to learn that is to experience the feelings caused by those actions.", "NTA.. I would have spanked that kid.  The seven year old knows better than to do that to someone smaller than him that's the problem he's never had his butt spanked\n\n\nAnd before people go off on me I did have my butt  spanked as a child and I've turned out fine there's a difference in between giving a spanking and then doing harm", "Unless someone is on fire, screaming needs to be off the table. And from your description it sounds like screaming *might* be a thing with your family. Make a break with that. You\u2019re not an ah, but screaming at a 7yo is no bueno and will teach him to be someone who screams instead of communicating. Your aunt should have been supervising both children if she was the only adult home. She\u2019s the one to be angry with. Try to talk about it, sans screaming.", "Losing your temper and screaming at a child is never awesome. YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
