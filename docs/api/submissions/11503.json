I never will be.\u201d And I said \u201coh come onnnn a little flirting won\u2019t hurt!\u201d And she said \u201cFCK YOU!

You try losing the love of your life and get back to me.", "YTA-you were being insensitive, you obviously struck a nerve and instead of backing off and let her be, you kept going. it's obvious that it still hurts and what you said hurts her. and she doesn't have to find a man if she doesn't want another one, she obviously loved her husband deeply and doesn't want someone else.", "YTA.

OP poked again and again until sister lost her shit. Then OP wants to play the victim and whine about wasting money for the spa and her sister is mad at her\u2026. Yeah because OP pushed her. That is the definition of gaslighting. \n\nSister needs therapy, that is not healthy behavior- however OP should not assume she\u2019s her sisters therapist and she shouldn\u2019t be lighthearted about something obviously NOT lighthearted to her sister. \n\nI get more angry the more I think about it.", "YTA.

All I can say is how dare you.", "YTA it sounds like your sister hasn\u2019t accepted her husband\u2019s death or the \u201ctill death due us part\u201d part of the wedding vows.

I think her reaction was a form of panic.    She does approach A-H again with her \"jealous\" text--but again this seems to be part of her denial.\n\nGive her some grace, maybe try to enlist some family members(Parents?) who could persuade her to get that therapy.", "yta. lol. her reaction is kinda funny to me but if your sister wants to be widowed then let her. idk how it affects you if she fucks a new guy or not.", "YTA for not backing off.

Never heard of that.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have kept pushing her to take the ring off. And the joke was poor taste. But the way she acted was crazy. Everyone grieves differently, but refusing to take off a ring for anything ever is ridiculous. Does she not take it off when she bathes? If she goes swimming? Does the dishes? Washes her hands? How many life experiences is she willing to miss out on simply because she won\u2019t take the ring off?", "Yes you were insensitive, but the bigger issue is your sisters inability to move on after 12 years she needs therapy  her reaction is unhinged", "YTA do you have any empathy at all in that cold heart of yours?

It seems pretty unreasonable that she would be required to take her ring off.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like he died young and assumingly tragically.  She\u2019s put him on a pedestal.  Doesn\u2019t exactly sound healthy for someone who was widowed at 23 and is now 35.", "ESH. OP made a rather disturbing comment whereas the sister was just nuts, though to some extent I understand that people grieve in different ways.", "NTA, you\u2019ve tolerated this behavior for YEARS and your sister is living in a delusion people have been enabling.\n\nSide note, removing rings before the sauna is usually because the fingers can swell and that\u2019s often dangerous.", "I'm torn here. On the one hand it's been 12 years and it looks like she's holding on in a ridiculous manner. Is there a bad story to the husband's passing we should know about that justifies her reaction?", "Wow. What a complicated situation. Maybe it's time for the family to have an intervention and talk to your sister about seeing a therapist/grief counselor because it sounds like her life is at a standstill and she's not moving forward. 12 years is a long time to have not moved forward.\n\nI'm going with you're NTA. I think your suggestion was reasonable.", "NTA- she needs to see a therapist", "NTA.

It is solely her decision.\n\nDon\u2019t think your YTA, but you need to stop pressuring her about the subject.\n\nYou have your opinion and she has hers.\nJust let her have it and do not pressure her in to yours being right- it is sensitive and  truly up to her only", "YTA OP you\u2019d think over 12 years of your sister grieving, you\u2019d understand her feelings and stance. Have you nit been paying attention or are you that much of a narcissist?", "\u201cJokingly\u201d saying something hurtful and offensive does not make it less hurtful or offensive. YTA.", "Well. Seems your sister has still a lot of mourning to do. It\u2019s not really sounding healthy to me and maybe she needs help. Because well, she is not married anymore, how painful that might be. And not letting any space for new love after 12 years is pretty long. \n\nAlso: I never took off my wedding rong in a sauna. Typical American ingress to prevent lawsuits or so. \n\nYta for not paying attention to how sensitive this was for your sister.", "This sounds like it was written by a 14 year old", "Light YTA but mainly, your sister isn't well.\n\nYou went too far but her reaction was pretty unhinged. \n\nShe's fair to not want to try dating but the rest is pretty unstable.", "YTA, OP. How about you go to a family whose child was killed 10 years ago in a car crash and say \"well hey, you can have another one, right? C'mon, not gonna fool around a little bit and have another kid to replace the dead one?\"\n\nDoes that sound kinda effed up to you? It does to me too. So why would you say that to your sister? \n\nMaybe your next birthday present could be staying away and not calling her.", "You are SO the AH! It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 12 days, 12 months, 12 years, or 12 millennia, some people simply never get over losing someone they loved so much. I\u2019m willing to bet you know exactly how much your sister still loves and misses her husband. And I think you could have guessed how your sister would react to being told to take off her ring. The fact that you ended but scolding her and then joking about it makes as really just insane.", "YTA. She didn't want to take off her ring and give it to a stranger, yeah I wouldn't either. Not even if they worked there. The moment your sister said it's not coming off you should've just moved on to do something else. \n\nAlso, why are you joking about finding a good man? Your story implies she has a husband? So you're telling a married woman she doesn't have a good man, should get naked, flirt a bit and find a good man? How in the hell did you not think that would hurt? You insulted her husband, her marriage and her morals. Jeez.\n\nShe took this too far? No, you did.", "Quite obviously, your sister is probably reminded of her late husband on her birthday a little bit more than most days because they used to spend it together. He probably did really nice things for her too. Have some sympathy. Yta.", "I don\u2019t mean to be a cynic, but the way this was written just sounds a little fake", "This 100% didn't happen.", "Or the person wearing the wedding ring could have looked up the rules themselves?\n\nSo NTA here, a little joking on the side is fine. The sister sounds like an emotional wreck.", "Does your sauna require removing wedding rings?", "Some saunas are hotter than others. The one at my gym hovers at 180 American degrees. Metal gets extremely hot and can burn you quite badly especially if you are sitting on a higher bench where the hot air moves to.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.. truly. I couldn't imagine the pain, sorrow and loss. I hope considering that you're holding up okay. I'm so sorry", "Yeah exactly. People are excusing it as grieving but that doesn\u2019t excuse ridiculous behaviour like screaming and running out of a place. It\u2019s been a decade. Some decorum would have been expected after all this time. Op shouldn\u2019t have made that statement but she went to the effort of setting up a spa day and her sister decided to be stubborn over a simple request. It\u2019s not like the spa was gonna steal it\u2026 \nOP is TA for escalating it, her sister was TA till then", "Never had to take off my rings for a sauna", "I've been to many a spa, and I've never had to take off my wedding and engagement rings to go in a sauna.", "Depends really, if you regularly do sauna you know if your jewelry will be an issue or not. I keep my wedding ring on, i do warn people that enter with watches or non gold jewelry.", "And metal gets hot in a sauna and can cause burns. Every sauna I've been in prohibited any metal jewelry.", "I'm from Finland, the origin country of sauna and I've never seen people take off their rings in sauna. We go to sauna naked  - no swimsuit or towels even, but everyone still keeps their wedding rings on. (And our saunas are properly hot, like 80-100 degrees Celsius or 176-212 degrees Fahrenheit.)\n\nOf course there could be someone with medical condition that would require to remove their jewelry - but I've never heard or encountered anyone like that.", "Please don\u2019t cite the DSM if you don\u2019t have the background to understand it\u2019s usage and limitations. The DSM is a tool. It is not prescriptive nor a Bible of human behaviour. It can be very helpful in some clinical settings. However, it is also heavily criticized by ***psychologists*** for its rigidity, lack of nuance, and lack of cultural sensitivity. Some also argue that it is demeaning and unhelpful to reduce people to a diagnosis. It is also problematic to try to frame uniquely personal experiences (such as grief) as psychopathology.   \n\nThere is not nearly enough information in this post to try to armchair diagnose someone. If diagnosing mental disorders were as easy as following a checklist we would not need mental health professionals. This can cause actual harm to people.", "Yeah, I remember a similar one. It's like OP is trying to provoke a specific discussion. Details are rubbish too I've never encountered this is rule in any spa.", "That is even worse. A ring on a finger has the temperature of the finger. If the ring around the chain loses contact to the skin it gets hot... She may burn herself.\n\nI don't get this. I wore my ring(s) always in the sauna. I way never told to take it off.", "I figure at a spa they assume most people aren\u2019t there all the time if they aren\u2019t familiar with them. Better safe than sorry.", "How would the metal get hotter than her skin or anything else?", "Well it is a terminal condition", "I\u2019m a nurse and on our MRI screening forms it\u2019s actually says rings are ok to stay on. I\u2019ve also had surgeries where I said I can\u2019t remove certain piercings and they\u2019re ok with it (obv every situation is different). \n\nBut I feel like it\u2019s weird about the sauna rule. I\u2019ve been in saunas before and no one has cared about rings. I understand fingers swell but that should just be the assumed risk of entering. Swelling from a sauna is only temporary. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Surgeries no jewellery whatsover", "They will tape it over for surgery if the patient won't or can't remove it", "Well, I learnt my lesson with my thin silver necklace, took me few minutes to remove it pronto \ud83e\udd75", "I agree, she very obviously needs therapy. And since it's been 12 years...like, where was her family, the sister?? Did they not notice for 12 years that she's not coping and healing well?\n\nAll the talk about \"we'll be together forever one day and you'll look like and idiot\" sort of feels unsafe, like she might try to do something to herself.", "Or she can pass on the thing she doesn't want to do. No harm is done by that.", "My mom never remarried after my dad died. Some people really stay married for eternity.", "They don't insist you remove all jewellery for surgery with no exceptions. When I was married they taped my wedding and engagement ring for an op and in the last 6 months I've had two surgeries where they've taped my navel piercing. All 3 under GA. \n\nOn a different note I've been to lots of spas and while they often warn that jewellery may heat up I've never been to one that insists you remove it, but then I'm not in the US.", "I\u2019m not in the US either and frankly unless the jewelry was unable to be removed, it should\u2019ve been. On top of swelling during surgery, it brings extra bacteria into the sterile environment, can mess with imaging equipment such as X-rays MRIs and ECGs, and depending on the surgery vs location of piercing can cause electrical burns if they need to use electrocauterization. \n\nThere SO many additional risks to keeping jewelry on and it\u2019s really not necessary. I\u2019ve never met a doctor or surgeon (and I met a fair few) who would agree to a wedding ring staying on in surgery unless it was an incredibly simple otolaryngological or laparoscopic procedure and absolutely demanded by the patient.", "What does the tape do? Just curious", "This, especially the bacteria concern. Wedding/engagement rings are manky as fuck - in my country you are legally not allowed to wear them while working food service, because they get so gross and covered in bacteria that they're considered a health and safety violation. The number of people I've had to explain that to, because I'm engaged and they keep asking to see my ring at work (and then being surprised when I don't have it on at work).\n\nAlso, slightly off-topic: I'd also be a little concerned about, like - what if something happens to the ring someday? There are certain situations outside of work where I don't wear my ring, because it's an heirloom and the chances of something happening to it are way too high. She insists that nothing will ever make her take it off. So is she leaving it on to wash dishes, or other similar activities where it might slip off and get lost? And if she is... What if that *happens*?  \nOr is she avoiding every single activity where it might possibly get lost, just so she never has to take it off? Because if she's limiting her life and activities specifically to avoid removing it, that's a mental health concern.", "Probably prevents the jewellery being tugged on by accident", "But they didn't tease them about the ring they made horrifically inappropriate comments about their current life choices. This is not about the ring, it is not about something that happened 12 years ago, it is about today and whether she wants to be in another romantic relationship."]}
