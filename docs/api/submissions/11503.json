I never will be.\u201d And I said \u201coh come onnnn a little flirting won\u2019t hurt!\u201d And she said \u201cFCK YOU!

You try losing the love of your life and get back to me.", "YTA-you were being insensitive, you obviously struck a nerve and instead of backing off and let her be, you kept going. it's obvious that it still hurts and what you said hurts her. and she doesn't have to find a man if she doesn't want another one, she obviously loved her husband deeply and doesn't want someone else.", "YTA.

OP poked again and again until sister lost her shit. Then OP wants to play the victim and whine about wasting money for the spa and her sister is mad at her\u2026. Yeah because OP pushed her. That is the definition of gaslighting. \n\nSister needs therapy, that is not healthy behavior- however OP should not assume she\u2019s her sisters therapist and she shouldn\u2019t be lighthearted about something obviously NOT lighthearted to her sister. \n\nI get more angry the more I think about it.", "YTA. Some people find the love of their life early but tragically lose them too soon.  All I can say is how dare you.", "YTA it sounds like your sister hasn\u2019t accepted her husband\u2019s death or the \u201ctill death due us part\u201d part of the wedding vows.

I think her reaction was a form of panic.    She does approach A-H again with her \"jealous\" text--but again this seems to be part of her denial.\n\nGive her some grace, maybe try to enlist some family members(Parents?) who could persuade her to get that therapy.", "yta. lol. her reaction is kinda funny to me but if your sister wants to be widowed then let her. idk how it affects you if she fucks a new guy or not.", "YTA for not backing off.

Never heard of that.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have kept pushing her to take the ring off. And the joke was poor taste. But the way she acted was crazy. Everyone grieves differently, but refusing to take off a ring for anything ever is ridiculous. Does she not take it off when she bathes? If she goes swimming? Does the dishes? Washes her hands? How many life experiences is she willing to miss out on simply because she won\u2019t take the ring off?", "Yes you were insensitive, but the bigger issue is your sisters inability to move on after 12 years she needs therapy  her reaction is unhinged", "YTA do you have any empathy at all in that cold heart of yours?

It seems pretty unreasonable that she would be required to take her ring off.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like he died young and assumingly tragically.  She\u2019s put him on a pedestal.  Doesn\u2019t exactly sound healthy for someone who was widowed at 23 and is now 35.", "ESH. OP made a rather disturbing comment whereas the sister was just nuts, though to some extent I understand that people grieve in different ways.", "NTA, you\u2019ve tolerated this behavior for YEARS and your sister is living in a delusion people have been enabling.\n\nSide note, removing rings before the sauna is usually because the fingers can swell and that\u2019s often dangerous.", "I'm torn here. On the one hand it's been 12 years and it looks like she's holding on in a ridiculous manner. Is there a bad story to the husband's passing we should know about that justifies her reaction?", "Wow. What a complicated situation. Maybe it's time for the family to have an intervention and talk to your sister about seeing a therapist/grief counselor because it sounds like her life is at a standstill and she's not moving forward. 12 years is a long time to have not moved forward.\n\nI'm going with you're NTA. I think your suggestion was reasonable.", "NTA- she needs to see a therapist", "NTA.

I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be happy to tell you that they aren\u2019t mind readers and that trying to tell someone that they only get to grieve for a certain period of time is irresponsible.", "This was in no way an appropriate way to approach that concern.", "This seems like a non-issue that just exploded.", "And that's exactly why what OP said is wrong. Nothing about the sisters behavior is concerning. Neither OP or you understand what it's like to lose a spouse, and neither of you are mental health professionals qualified to say whether or not her grief is normal. And you're right - until you've experienced it, you can't imagine what it's like. Listen to the person who is telling you about their experience, like OP's sister.\n\nI stopped wearing my wedding ring about a year after my husband's death and eventually remarried, but not everyone has the same grief journey. If she wants to continue to wear her ring after 12 years and not date anyone else, that's perfectly normal and healthy.", "Don't disagree but OP didn't do anything that would help lead them to that professional help", "Probably because her sister and probably the rest of her family spend all their time pushing her to \u201cjust start dating again\u201d, a constant pressure that eventually results in a massive explosion. Because humans are complex creatures and no two humans will have the same emotional reaction to something.", "The sister drew a boundary only to have it stomped twice, in a very public setting and in a humiliating way. On top of that, many spa treatments can release pent up emotion and I'm sure she was sensitive about yet another birthday without her husband. And given how OP talks about her sister, I doubt this is the first time that boundary has been stomped. So no, I don't think that was an over-reaction in this context.", "People have the right to freak out about whatever they chose. Wedding rings are definitely sacred objects.", "Exactly", "From her comments it\u2019s very clear it\u2019s religion based. She thinks he\u2019s up in heaven waiting for her. Take as long as you like to move on. But if your reasons aren\u2019t based in reality no one but family will try and help you yo move in\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be together forever one day you\u2019ll see and then you\u2019ll look like a total dumbass\u201d Lolololol", "[removed]", "Okay. But I didn\u2019t make a judgment about the method, only mused about the possible rationale behind it.", "so what if she does not want to date anyone else. Like it\u2019s not anyone job to make her move on. The only person who can help her is herself. You can\u2019t save people they have to do it on their own. You also cannot force people to change either they have to do it on their own. There are many people who believe that even for their own pets. Maybe she believe that he is in heaven because it makes her feel better. Maybe she needs that belief to keep going in life. Who are you to judge anyone about what they believe in just because you don\u2019t have the same belief or agree with it?", "AH, typical. \u201cYou must be a teenager since you don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d \n\nWay older than 14. Old enough to know that assigning time limits to human emotions is a notion made in bad faith. \n\nOne day you\u2019ll grow up and realize that.\nToodaloo.", "sure...I just don't think people who behave like OP are actually motivated by concern.", "Her sister wasn\u2019t forcing her to do anything. She tried to nudge her to remove the ring for a few minutes and broaches the subject of dating in the future\u2026what a monster. Then her sister goes off in how they\u2019ll be together forever in heaven and that she\u2019s a dumbass. But ya glad her fake religion makes her feel better\u2026hasn\u2019t made her an asshole in this life or anything\n\nI\u2019d love to believe my cat is going to some magical paradise when he passes. Doesn\u2019t make it real", "Oh ok--way older--18 then. Got it.\n\nNo, it's just that you're apparently easily triggered and unknowledgeable.\n\nSaying that a grieving period is unhealthily long is not \"telling someone\" how long to grieve. Idc how long this woman grieves. Idc about anyone's unhealthy behaviors. But it is objectively unhealthy.", "OP was being mean about and the way she said it was way out of line. If OP said that to me I would be so mean back she would be crying for hours. She lucky her sister just left. There are something you don\u2019t say to people specially on their birthday. It\u2019s called tike and place it probably and most likely not the first time Op has tried to nudge or be pushy about it. \n\nIt was messed up of OP and very judgmental.  Not even more own sister would say that to me even though we hate each other. She would never say that to someone grieving regardless how many years it been. Yeah op could be down playing a lot of what they actually said in this post. We don\u2019t know if that was OP exact words that was said or not.", "Objectively unhealthy? Then you should be able to come up with any kind of source to back that up"]}
