I never will be.\u201d And I said \u201coh come onnnn a little flirting won\u2019t hurt!\u201d And she said \u201cFCK YOU!

You try losing the love of your life and get back to me.", "YTA-you were being insensitive, you obviously struck a nerve and instead of backing off and let her be, you kept going. it's obvious that it still hurts and what you said hurts her. and she doesn't have to find a man if she doesn't want another one, she obviously loved her husband deeply and doesn't want someone else.", "YTA.

OP poked again and again until sister lost her shit. Then OP wants to play the victim and whine about wasting money for the spa and her sister is mad at her\u2026. Yeah because OP pushed her. That is the definition of gaslighting. \n\nSister needs therapy, that is not healthy behavior- however OP should not assume she\u2019s her sisters therapist and she shouldn\u2019t be lighthearted about something obviously NOT lighthearted to her sister. \n\nI get more angry the more I think about it.", "YTA. Some people find the love of their life early but tragically lose them too soon.  All I can say is how dare you.", "YTA it sounds like your sister hasn\u2019t accepted her husband\u2019s death or the \u201ctill death due us part\u201d part of the wedding vows.

I think her reaction was a form of panic.    She does approach A-H again with her \"jealous\" text--but again this seems to be part of her denial.\n\nGive her some grace, maybe try to enlist some family members(Parents?) who could persuade her to get that therapy.", "yta. lol. her reaction is kinda funny to me but if your sister wants to be widowed then let her. idk how it affects you if she fucks a new guy or not.", "YTA for not backing off.

Never heard of that.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have kept pushing her to take the ring off. And the joke was poor taste. But the way she acted was crazy. Everyone grieves differently, but refusing to take off a ring for anything ever is ridiculous. Does she not take it off when she bathes? If she goes swimming? Does the dishes? Washes her hands? How many life experiences is she willing to miss out on simply because she won\u2019t take the ring off?", "Yes you were insensitive, but the bigger issue is your sisters inability to move on after 12 years she needs therapy  her reaction is unhinged", "YTA do you have any empathy at all in that cold heart of yours?

It seems pretty unreasonable that she would be required to take her ring off.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like he died young and assumingly tragically.  She\u2019s put him on a pedestal.  Doesn\u2019t exactly sound healthy for someone who was widowed at 23 and is now 35.", "ESH. OP made a rather disturbing comment whereas the sister was just nuts, though to some extent I understand that people grieve in different ways.", "NTA, you\u2019ve tolerated this behavior for YEARS and your sister is living in a delusion people have been enabling.\n\nSide note, removing rings before the sauna is usually because the fingers can swell and that\u2019s often dangerous.", "I'm torn here. On the one hand it's been 12 years and it looks like she's holding on in a ridiculous manner. Is there a bad story to the husband's passing we should know about that justifies her reaction?", "Wow. What a complicated situation. Maybe it's time for the family to have an intervention and talk to your sister about seeing a therapist/grief counselor because it sounds like her life is at a standstill and she's not moving forward. 12 years is a long time to have not moved forward.\n\nI'm going with you're NTA. I think your suggestion was reasonable.", "NTA- she needs to see a therapist", "NTA.

You have to dig deep if you take this out of the \"joke\"", "We have a sauna at home. I've never taken my ring off to use it, neither has my husband, no issues. This seems like H&S overkill to me.", "And then afterwards they go back to normal. No swelling is enough to cause any permanent damage. It\u2019s easy enough to just pop the finger in cold water if it swells a bit. I\u2019ve never known any spa to have this as a rule - only as an advisory and instructions on what to do if swelling does happen", "I ***hate*** saunas", "Never have I encountered this rule in any public sauna. Do you know a concrete place with that rule?", "180 is not even hot for a finish type of sauna. I have been to several in the 90C/200F range and rings don't get hot as they are in direct contact with your skin.\n\nDangling jewelry like large earrings or necklaces can become really hot and hurt you though.", "Funny, there's a different one I was thinking about.", "Some people aren\u2019t ready to move on from a loved one, even after 12 years. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Presumably, if OP is actually close with and cares about her sister she would have some understanding as to whether or not her sister actually wants to move on or not and should act accordingly. You may find this hard to believe but people are perfectly capable of living their lives without a partner, especially if they already found and lost someone they really loved. The sister does not need to move on if she does not want to and OP should have known those \u201cjokes\u201d would be inappropriate and cruel", "Depending on the sauna, no. You realise quite quickly that you made a mistake.", "This. I\u2019ve never been asked to take off my ring at a spa or massage place - nor would I trust to randomly hand my ring to a stranger (especially for them to walk away with it!).", "My mentioning PCBD here is not an attempt to diagnose the OP\u2019s sister. Of course we can\u2019t know from the limited context if she meets the diagnostic criteria. And on top of that, PCBD is controversial for pathologizing grief.\n\nI only mention it to counter claims that there\u2019s no such thing as grieving too long. There was enough consensus among psychologists to declare certain manifestations of prolonged grief as problematic.\n\n>Just because it\u2019s been 12 years doesn\u2019t mean anything.", "Thats what I was getting too. My parents never took their rings off, and I did not either, for many years. My thoughts were My husband put it there for it to remain, and so it did. I'm more lenient with myself now as our rings are titanium, and in age fingers do swell etc. Not often you see it off, but if it is theres a damn good reason.", "and I suspect it was known by all, sometimes people give gifts in the guise of manipulation. \n\nYou wanted that ring off her finger, You wanted her to date, but you never for one considered what she wanted.\n\nYTA", "Which is fine.", "How long are we allowed to grieve then? What time frame is appropriate in your completely unqualified opinion?", "Not just dismissive but outright bullying about it. She said no. Op kept pushing and pushing. You know this is not the first time.", "No. Absolutely not. Take all jewelry off at home and leave it there. Never, ever is jewelry allowed for operations, x-rays, MRIs, anything.", "Surgery they need to come off but they're OK in mri. I've taken my daughter for 7 MRIs this year and never took off my jewelery when I went in the mri suite with her.", "It\u2019s problematically long if it\u2019s negatively impacting your relationships, livelihood, ability to thrive, etc., after a year.\n\nI really don\u2019t understand the sentiment that endless grief is not problematic.", ">til death do ~~you~~ *us* part\n\nI know it\u2019s been watered down and genericized in meaning but it might help if you consider where that phrase actually came from. \n\n\u201c\u2018Til death do us part\u201d wasn\u2019t originally intended as a promise that the couple *planned* to remain together for life\u2026 it was an acknowledgment that a married couple HAD to stay together for life because the Catholic Church didn\u2019t recognize divorce. The meaning was simply that you\u2019d be permitted to marry again after your spouse\u2019s death, not that you had to. \n\nWith that lens, and having been raised in a Catholic family, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be concerned about if OP\u2019s sister chooses not to pursue a new romantic relationship. All of the widowed women in my family have lived the same way. When my dad died, my mom made it very clear that she had no interest in ever dating or marrying again because my dad was her \u201conce in a lifetime love\u201d and she still considers him her husband. OP and the rest of her family need to understand that the weight and interpretation that people give to their vows depends entirely on the individual, and their opinions don\u2019t matter and likely aren\u2019t wanted.", "Being \"concerned\" does not make you abuse them.", "Since you're not aware of the sister's religion and clearly her message indicates that she doesn't believe 'til death do us part'...maybe start by asking whether people are concerned over her being lonely or because they don't agree with her religion", "Yeah - my husband and I have a sauna. It's never been an issue. Not even an inkling that it might be. For either of us.", "I\u2019ve had MRIs and a CT scan and was provided with a locker and a key to ensure my belongings were safe. The spas I\u2019ve been to have also provided lockers. I don\u2019t have an item I\u2019m unwilling to remove, so I can\u2019t speak to the sauna thing, although I\u2019ve yet to encounter an employee standing guard at the sauna door. \n\nOP could have just asked what her sister could enjoy without taking off her ring while she went into the sauna. I\u2019m sure there would have been options. \n\nMaybe OPs sister needs therapy, but that was definitely not the venue for an intervention.", "I have worn my wedding bands during surgery. The nurse has always placed a bandaid or tape around them so they don't come off during the surgery.", "I was just wondering if it's possible to leave the jewellery on. Of course it's completely different situations, especially when one is sprung up on you and avoidable.", "YES THIS.", "Ah, the next x-rays will be fun... Got my tongue pierced and if my dentist wants an x-ray done, I've got to contact my piercer first. XD", "Oh good lord it's another atheist who was traumatized by Christianity and can't conceive of the possibility that religions other than Christianity exist and are fundamentally different from Christianity.", "It wasn't an errant comment, it was a cruel joke. And I'm guessing that her family (or at the very least, this sister) has been stomping all over her boundaries for years and she just about had it. Also, some familial relationships are not worth having, especially ones as disrespectful as this one.", "Is not going into a sauna impacting her livelihood? Or her ability to thrive? Don\u2019t be so ridiculous.", "My husband's grandmother was widowed in her early 30s. 5 kids together. She died (recently) in her mid 80s. As far as she was concerned, she was married. She still wore her ring, & got it adjusted when her knuckles swelled up from arthritis.", "how old was your mother? i'm guessing her husband didn't die when she was 23. This is a silly comparison", "From a theological perspective it was also to make clear that marriage (in Catholicism and most of Christianity) doesn\u2019t transcend death. It\u2019s something as a Catholic I\u2019ve always been a bit weirded out by.", "Exactly.  Then factor in the men available later in life.  Most men are married.  One friend told me dating in her twenties was like dining in a fine restaurant. Dating in her early fifties was like dumpster diving for a meal.  Staying single should not be a problem.", "Personally, I just don't like jewellery on when I go to the sauna. Especially not the 70\u00b0C/158\u00b0F Finnish ones. But that's me, and other people are of course different. :)", "My dad had to take his off for a surgery (the surgery was on his hand, so, yeah) but because he had worn it for over 20 years without taking it off it was hardcore stuck. Took a lot of patience and WD40 to wiggle it off his finger, and he had to get it slightly resized to he could get it back ON after the surgery was over and the swelling went down.", "The problem  is if they're using electro cautry during the surgery", "Omg\u2026 that response was directed at the question above, not in response to the original post.", "25, pregnant with me, so quite relatable.", "My thoughts exactly. I would bet that she is a Mormon as the belief is you marry for time and eternity, with marriage being a very important pillar life.", "The fact that shes 35 and plans on staying married to a dead man til she dies is fucked up and sad. Damn right her sister is pressuring her into dating other people, she'd be an awful sister if  she weren't.

Not every surgery is at the open heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd thus, there are different rules.", "> extra bacteria\n\nThis is what I've been told. I haven't had a real surgery yet (apart from getting wisdom teeth removed under \"twilight sleep\" (??? - not really GA, but you're also not completely there), but I wasn't wearing jewellery then.", "I'm 41 and not religious and wouldn't re marry or even date if my wife died. I'm well aware theres no one else for me lol\n\nI came to that conclusion when she had cancer a few years ago. Makes u think about things you would not normally think about", "No, the fact that you think a woman that is not interested in dating and getting married again should get pressured into it is fucked up and sad. She is her own person and she can decide damn well for herself if she wants to be in a relationship again.", "Hence my second paragraph. \n\nThough my point still stands, anything defined as surgery includes making an incision in the skin. Why add additional bacteria into what is supposed to be a sterile environment and increase the risk of infection? Most surgeries also use anesthesia which require ecg monitoring the entire time the patient is under.\n\nWhere I live, the blanket rule for all surgeries is no jewelry. The exceptions would be jewelry unable to be removed (in which case taped up), and again, otolaryngological and laparoscopic surgeries *and* only if the patient absolutely demanded."]}
