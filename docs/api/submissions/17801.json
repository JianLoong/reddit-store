He's going through a divorce right now and he's been very down. His ex-wife has the kids since she has family where my cousins grew up whereas me and the rest of his family lives in this city. Aside from work, he has a lot of free time. I am back in my home city since I live away for university and I'm staying for a week. \n\nMy whole schedule is packed. Seeing my friends, doing some hikes, spending time with my parents, studying etc. I'm very stretched with my time but I only ever come back a couple times a year for my brothers' birthdays. \n\nThe issue is: last night at midnight, my uncle came over wanting to hang out. I was about to head to bed because I had an early day today and I just wanted to sleep. I've seen my uncle a couple times already (I'm on visit day 5/7) and all he does is dump on me about his relationship and while I do listen to be supportive, it's really heavy stuff and I don't have enough time for it. So when he arrived, I asked him if he could come back tomorrow at dinner when I'm free and when my parents are awake. He said he understood and left and I went to bed. But today, my dad found out that I asked him to go home (he is staying a 10 minute drive) and he was very annoyed with me, calling me selfish and saying that my uncle rarely sees me and I should have invited him in. \n\nWas it that bad of me to ask him to go home? It was midnight and I was tired and he showed up completely unannounced.

Only AH in this case is your uncle and dad!", "NTA both your uncle and your dad are weird. You shouldn\u2019t have to be your uncles therapist", "NTA. It's not normal to go visiting at midnight and getting grumpy because that time doesn't suit the people you are visiting.", "NTA.\n\nYour uncle is desperate for someone to talk to, but it's not your responsibility and it's inappropriate for him to pressure you to be his victim. The time of night just makes it more ridiciulous.\n\nLet him be annoyed with you and call you selfish, it doesn't take a genius to realise that he's projecting his own selfishness. It's up to you whether you expect an apology from him or not, but do not apologise under any circumstances to him, not even just a socially calming empty one. Everyone in the family needs to fully internalise that your uncle is entirely to blame here.", "NTA. It was a bad time for you. It wasn't you acting selfish at all.", "NTA. As a woman your uncle's age who went through vaguely similar situations several times in my early twenties, a not-small percentage of older men--whether intentionally or not--have a tendency to take advantage of much younger women's feelings of obligation (family or work-related) to make use of their time in ways that are not entirely appropriate. It is *completely* innappropriate for a 52-year-old man to visit a 20-year-old female relative at midnight for any type of conversation, and I'm sorry but he's *fully* aware of that fact. I'm pretty livid that your father thinks what his brother is doing is ok instead of protecting you. Please continue to turn away these kinds of approaches. I'm proud of you for sticking up for yourself. It took me several awkward situations to realize that older men maneuvering me into spending time with them for what initially seemed like mildly odd but not-nefarious reasons, leveraging my sense of obligation, know what they are doing and that their motives aren't pure. If your uncle honestly just wanted to talk to your dad, fine, it would have been good to let him in. Sounds like he wanted to talk to *you*, however--alone, at midnight--and that is *seriously* not ok.", "NTA\n\nnext time let him in, wake up your dad and go to your room", "NTA Your dad and uncle are both strange people.", "NTA. He may mean well but they have unrealistic and inappropriate expectations for you. Coming over at midnight to hang out? You are not responsible for caring for your uncle - especially on demand.", "NTA.  Your uncle learned about your boundaries.", "NTA, and your father is much too free with the word \"selfish,\" and maybe you should stop spending time in his company till he learns to respect you and your boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m the same age as your uncle. I\u2019m sorry that he\u2019s going through a hard time. He should\u2019ve discerned that going yo your house at midnight was too late. \nI\u2019m unimpressed with your dad over this. You\u2019re not selfish at all. That\u2019s a ridiculous take.", "NTA you are not obligated to hang out with anyone who shows up uninvited at midnight. Tell your dad though, next time you\u2019re gonna wake him up and he can deal with them.", "NTA tell your dad you're not a counselor and if they wish to treat you as such, you will no be billing them at an hourly rate, whether it's 10 or 60 mins.", "YTA.\nEarlier into the post I thought you were living alone but if your parents, specially dad is present then you should have woken him up and asked him to handle the situation.\n\nWe need to be pragmatic but little more kind as well. He might have been feel alone and desperate. There is always fear such desperate people can lead to self harm. \nSeeing the comments saying you did good makes me understand why there are so many children doing self harm in western world. Not shaming western world here rest of the world has its share of problems while west bas some very nice achievements as well.\n\nYes people need to be civil and plan but we can cut some slack to the family members or desperate people when there is no risk of physical violence.\n\nSo your schedule is packed meeting your friends, doing hikes and spending time with parents!!! I don't think that's called packed schedule, that's called blissful life.\nAnd still you let a alone, struggling and most probably a desperate person go. You just need to wake your father up.\n\nYTA", "YTA possibly depending upon your uncle's normal behavior and how much of a red flag this was. People who are normally considerate don't suddenly drop by in the middle of the night to talk unless they really need help. I get the feeling that your father was concerned about him and this was more than a \"you should be polite to guests\" kind of response. \n\nIf in doubt and your dad wants someone in your household there to support your uncle when he shows up at midnight, maybe you can wake him up so he can talk to your uncle and you can continue going to bed as planned.", "Help me understand. You sent your uncle away from his brother's house, where you are staying as a guest? This is a YTA of biblical proportions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The uncle was there to hang out with his nephew, OP, not his brother. OP was going to bed and didn't want to hang out but suggested an alternative time. This doesn't make him an asshole. If the uncle had so desired he could have asked to see his brother, to which OP would probably have replied he's asleep and I don't want to wake him. Again, perfectly reasonable. Then the uncle could have said well I'll go and wake him. Sure that would have gone down well. But anyways... the point is he didn't ask for this, so it wasn't offered.\n\nImo OP is definitely NTA, but what really threw me is even if you disagree what in this whole scenario makes him an asshole of \"biblical proportion\" to you???

You're not his free therapist, and qualified therapists have office hours and don't take surprise midnight drop-ins.  Please suggest group therapy for people going through divorce.

Not sure, I am having a hard time giving a judgement on this one. \n\nFrom my understanding, it wasn't your house. It was your parents' house. Based on that, you're kind of TA. \n\nThe right thing would have been to let him in and go wake up your parents. Your uncle is your dad/mom 's sibling, it's only right it be their responsibility to take care of him when they insist he be let into the house any time of the day.\n\nYour uncle also sucks, because divorce or not, midnight is no hour to do an unannounced house call. \n\nYou don't have to be a therapist for your uncle and if it happens again in any discussion, you should delegate to your parents.
