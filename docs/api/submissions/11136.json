My mother and everyone else was overjoyed. My cousin didn\u2019t say much, neither did her mom, but I thought that\u2019s fair enough. Later on I was cuddling my daughter and being silly with her, and everyone was telling me how lovely she is and how lucky I am. \nMy cousin got up, left and slammed the door. Everyone said to let her sulk, so her mum took her side and said I was being super insensitive and should apologise. I told her I still haven\u2019t received an apology for their abortion and slut comments so I won\u2019t be apologising to anyone, so she left too. \n\nMy family is divided.

And it sounds like she doesnt like not having the attention of everyone around her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCongrats on the baby BTW", "NTA. You are owed an apology. A big one. No, that won't magically make her problems go away but my god... you're owed basic human decency. I also don't think you were rubbing anything in her face?? You showed your mum a scan photo. Unless there's a chunk of the story missing here, I cant see what you did wrong. They'd have found out about the baby anyway and then you'd have had it in the neck for not telling them.

You have nothing to do with her infertility; you are neither its cause nor withholding its solution. If she cannot even stand to be in a room when such news is announced, she should seek help.

Yes, that kind of thing leaves scars, I know too well, and I understand your resentment of her, which is wholly deserved.  She's now learning that she'll never have what you have, and that's a horrific pain, regardless of whether she was shitty to you as a teenager or not, and we're not judging based on something that happened years ago when you were kids, but rather what is happening NOW as you're adults, and while you don't have a close relationship, you admit that your families have made up mostly and you're at least cordial).*\n\nI would have said that your cousin is a bit of an asshole here, but her reaction and pain are very real, and very devastating, so I kinda get that reaction too.  All I ever wanted in life was to have kids. That was my ONLY real life's dream.  My wife is also not able to get pregnant, despite us trying for years and years and years, and even going through IVF unsuccessfully.  I can tell you that even for me, that pain is very real and I feel gutted every time I see some happy parent with their child, or even TB shows and moves that focus on a parent/child dynamic.  My wife feels even worse.  Being unable to get pregnant has led to depression and  horrible self esteem as she blames herself for what her body won't do (something completely out of her control). She even contemplated leaving me at one point because she was certain I, in her words, \"deserved someone who was whole and can give you that child you want\".  It's had a huge effect on her for a long time and only within the last couple years has she really been able to put that past her.\n\nMy point from all this is that neither of you did wrong here.  You are understandably happy, are doing normal parent things with a new child, and your family are understandably happy for you and showing that.  Your cousin, likewise, while seeming to have a shitty reaction, likely feels that loss and pain every time she sees you and your baby, or any parent/child out there, and I'm willing to bet takes it as a personal failure that she hasn't been able to get pregnant.  It's ultimately, however, something she needs to sort out on her own, that's the only way.\n\nCongrats on the new child... make the most of it, for those of us who will never have that chance.", "I think NTA but..   the only way you're in the wrong here is if there's more to the story and you have some bad feelings towards this family member and indulge in having children in a passive-aggressive way in front of her to make her feel bad. You're the only person that knows if that's your intention or not. As long as it's not you're totally in the good. Obviously, if somebody wants kids and can't have them it's very difficult and how much you accommodate that is up to you but you should be able to enjoy having young children and bringing them to the family.", "NTA Do not apologise for not doing anything wrong, or for things you have absolutely no control over. If you start doing that you will become a target for being lashed out on, a scapegoat. Be careful of the motives of those who are trying to make you say sorry for things you haven't done. Are they trying to control you, make you a doormat? Are they using you as a sacrifice to appease the feelings of others because they care more about the other person's feelings than yours? Do they want to look better in the other person's eyes so they don't care how much they hurt you in the process? If you do not agree with what other people are saying, always look to reasons why they might have said it. It is usually more than 'keep the peace', that is just their excuse to you to make you do what they want.", "You're NTA for being cuddly with your daughter but I think you A T A for revealing a pregnancy at someone else's celebration. I understand that this might be a rare occasion get together but you should have asked prior to the person being celebrated.\nYour cousin is being a spoiled brat by thinking her actions have no consequences. Her mom is too. They bullied you about your pregnancy and told you you should END A LIFE. Now that they know cousin is infertile they are hating everything to do with babies because they are jealous. They are especially jealous of you because they probably think they could have avoided the situation had you gone trough the termination of your pregnancy as they wanted.\nYour cousin had a ton of problems that could be dealt with with a ton of physiological treatment. The grieving for the end of her marriage, the grieving for the babies she won't have are the main ones, but I'm pretty sure she has way more issues that she's not dealing with.\nCongratulations on your pregnancy and hoping you have a safe delivery and a healthy baby! \ud83d\ude18", "ESH. I think teenagers tend to be awful in general, you all are 17 and your brains aren\u2019t fully formed, you tend to be ding dongs to each other without even realizing you\u2019re being \u201cactually\u201d mean, because life isn\u2019t real to you yet. Your cousin should definitely apologize to you in private, away from your daughter\u2019s ears. \n\nBut you\u2019re 23 and an adult now (though you\u2019ve got two more years for your prefrontal cortex to finish) and you\u2019re being very cruel on your own. It may be different in your culture, but in mine, showing your bebe scans at someone else\u2019s party, even if it IS the grandma, is attention-seeking and selfish (because 1. It\u2019s your mom\u2019s party, not yours, let her have the spotlight and 2. Nothing can compete with a new baby! So everyone else feels like their presents suck in comparison, like how you don\u2019t give a Bentley at a birthday, you give it after the party so no one feels like a sucky present-giver and the party remains Grandma\u2019s Birthday Party and not That Party Where OP Announced She Was Pregnant/Gave A Bentley). \n\nSo I agree with your family about being more sensitive, I don\u2019t know if you need to apologize.

This is no different. It\u2019s hard to know whether OP\u2019s approach could have benefited from more sensitivity because the details are lacking.

Mine would, actually, she did.  I told her on mothers\u2019 day.  And a few days later, her birthday, her coworkers gave her a cake, \u201cto grandma [my mom\u2019s name]\u201d.  She loved it.  For that matter, if one of my kids announced at a party for me, **I** would!", "Don\u2019t apologize, it doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything. It\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s infertile, if they couldn\u2019t treat you with respect and kindness when you had your first child then they don\u2019t deserve yours either.", "Probably a good thing she can\u2019t have kids. Can you imagine if her child got pregnant young how she would act towards them? NTA", "NTA Your child is a human being and the fact that you can have more isn't a comment on your cousin. Your daughter is allowed to exist in your family and you're allowed to make space for more without catering to your cousin's feelings.\n\nYou cousin should see a therapist if she can't be around children without becoming angry. She has issues she needs to deal with in a healthy manner.", "NTA- sometimes the best revenge truly is living well", "I mean you\u2019re NTA - but you didn\u2019t need to rub it in her face. It was petty. Transcending is always better.\n\nNo need to apologize for something you\u2019re excited about, but don\u2019t need to bring up bitterness and resentment from years ago", "NTA", "Honestly I\u2019m inclined to say soft ESH. She is in a tough situation but ultimately karma is coming for her. And showing off an ultrasound or enjoying a relationship with the child she shamed you for does not make you TA. Especially at your mother\u2019s party, her aunt. Not vice versa.\n\nHOWEVER. There have been countless threads here along the lines of \u201csomeone announced a pregnancy at an unrelated event even though they knew I was infertile/miscarried/etc, AITA for being upset\u201d and Reddit almost always sides with the poster. I feel like if you wanted to hurt her or get some payback, this was the way to do it, and that kinda makes you TA too. Not wrong, but still TA.", "NTA.\n\nAnd it doesn't count as an apology if you don't mean it.  I'm guessing that you wouldn't mean it.\n\nBesides, sharing the joy of your kids isn't anyone's problem except for your infertile cousin. Who will run into lots of fertile parents. And I think she would do well to attend therapy to get a handle on it.\n\nIt's not your problem to manage.", "Eh, I think ESH. \n\nIf you know someone is infertile, it\u2019s pretty shitty to make a huge deal about your pregnancy at a party that isn\u2019t yours. Would have been better to let her mom relay the information.\n\nI also think you need to understand your cousin was also 17 at the time you were pregnant. She was a child and was likely mimicking what she heard her parents say. \n\nCuddling your own child is totally fine, though.", "If you were playing with your daughter as a normal mother you were NTA. If you were going above what you normally do just to rub your cousin\u2018s face in dirt as payback of her cruel remarks, you were TA. You know what you did. When someone is cruel to you, like what you described your cousin and her mother did to you, your responsibility is to go no contact with them and not to let their craziness to bring out your worst behavior. A better option would have been to greet your cousin and Aunt politely, stay quiet, only speak to them when you are out of polite options, and say good-bye when they left the house. You were not obligated to engage in a personal conversation with them. Tell yourself you will be a mentally healthy adult in their presence so they can learn from your example. Let them be crazy by themselves.", "Nta", "NTA - even if your cousin wasn't a bully to you in high school, you wouldn't be the asshole in this situation. You are not responsible for her emotions or medical situation. If she had wanted to leave because it was hard for her, fine. But that's not your responsibility at all.", "NTA \n\nYour cousin's feelings are somewhat valid. She can be upset at the situation but it won't do her any good. If her goal is a relationship and having a child she needs to find a willing partner that will go through surrogacy and/or adoption.\n\nAs for your aunt, she can't demand an apology in the same vain for never apologizing to you for how her daughter treated you when pregnant. That's bs.", "NTA \n\nHow long are you supposed to hide your kids for?\n\nUntil they are 18?", "NTA.  Infertility sucks, but you don't get to hate on other people's happiness just because you are having a rough time.", "Reading these posts makes me feel so lucky to have my husband. I'm going through some medical things and had a possible infertile scare (it does not seem to be the case and we're not trying yet but the unknown is scary) so I asked him \"is this a deal breaker for you? Cause I'd like to know now if it is.\"\n\n\"Why would I fault you for something you have no control over? There's always adoption or surrogacy.\" *Goes back to playing video games*\n\nI wish more people were okay with adoption. I've never understood why people care so much about the child being biological to them. I hope to adopt someday. \n\nNTA - I can feel for your cousin for her situation, but you're not showing off. You still have your life to live and she does owe you an apology for the crap she said to you in high school. It's not like you put the photo an inch from her face and said \"looky looky! Don't you wish you could know how this feels?!\"", "Dealing with infertility is brutal, but you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to keep peace with the two of them at all, let them scramble.", "NTA. \n\nWhile there may be some people who are amazing who can't have kids, it doesn't apply to this situation. \n\n\nkarma. amazing.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to celebrate things despite her struggles. The way she acted is incredibly immature. Congrats on the pregnancy OP!", "This is what I was wondering and will determine if OP is the AH.", "How was OP a brat? All she did was announce she was pregnant.", "How the fuck is OP bullying someone with her pregnancy announcement?", "Why", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Cousin was a bully to her when they were kids. Cousin got what she deserved. Karma is a bitch.", "Thank you for this, truly\u2764 I've been struggling to conceive for a little while now, reading that comment and the \"karma\" thing did make me wince a bit.", "Karma isnt just consequence of any action but it was included actions from \"this & previous\" existences resulting in what happen in \"future\" exitences.\n\nIn general, people think of it as cause & effect. So yes you can disagreed with one religion. But you cannot tell others who believed the true essense of karma that they cannot talk about it.", "crazy how you\u2019re wrong about two different posts \ud83e\udd74", "Karma ..\nnoun. kar\u00b7\u200bma \u02c8k\u00e4r-m\u0259 also \u02c8k\u0259r- Synonyms of karma. often capitalized : the force generated by a person's actions held in Hinduism and Buddhism to perpetuate transmigration and in its ethical consequences to determine the nature of the person's next existence.\n\nBasically if you act like a snake in this lifetime you're gonna come back as a snake in your next lifetime.", "Love to see a clue about what is clearly a reference", "Nope cousin got what she deserved.", "I\u2019m infertile too and instead of making everybody else\u2019s problem I went to therapy and dealt with it. People should be able to enjoy babies without some unhealed infertile woman in the background doing the whole woe is me routine.", "So you know she didn\u2019t apologize but you don\u2019t care because you believe she needs to be coddled because of her infertility. I have been throughly insulted by my previous best friend who is infertile too. Some people need to learn that they cannot get away with being bullies just because of infertility or other problems.", "I only brought it up cause the rando responding to me was relying on her own kids to make a point about someone else (OP)\n\nThey should be able to, but this post reeks of one sided skewed attention seeking over stale teenage angst\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the infertility, but a partner abandoning her. Just wow.\n\nIt\u2019s gross and smug", "Where did I say she needed to be coddled? I just don\u2019t trust op is as innocent as they claim to be. \n\nThe reaction to thinking op might be sketchy is weird as hell, and peoples defences of her are bizarre and off puttingly based on their own personal stories and not the details of the post. \n\nCreepy af"]}
