I was subject to relentless bullying from classmates, teachers random adults. My cousin attended the same high school as me and was in the same year, and was considered popular among our peers. She was one of the people who bullied me most. She was relentless and made my life miserable along with her complicit mother (my aunt) who loved to make comments too.

My then boyfriend got a job and I did my degree online while working part time and we got through it. We are now married, and both have very well paying jobs. I now have a 6 year old and another baby on the way and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. My parents adore their granddaughter, and her great grandparents absolutely spoil her, and love it too. Our families eventually made up too through our grandparents though this is fairly recent, and I don\u2019t see my cousin that much as I do resent her. \n\nMy cousin is unable to get pregnant and is medically infertile. Her and her husband tried for a long time and her husband recently left her because he wants biological kids. She is understandably devastated. \n\nIt was my mothers birthday and the whole family attended the get together. I showed my mom the scans and revealed the pregnancy at the party. My mother and everyone else was overjoyed. My cousin didn\u2019t say much, neither did her mom, but I thought that\u2019s fair enough. Later on I was cuddling my daughter and being silly with her, and everyone was telling me how lovely she is and how lucky I am. \nMy cousin got up, left and slammed the door. Everyone said to let her sulk, so her mum took her side and said I was being super insensitive and should apologise. I told her I still haven\u2019t received an apology for their abortion and slut comments so I won\u2019t be apologising to anyone, so she left too. \n\nMy family is divided.

You have nothing to apologize for.  People say \"keep the peace\" because they are afraid of the other's anger/reactions.  That just allows bullies to keep being bullies.\n\nAll I can say to your cousin and aunt is, KARMA.", "It should NEVER  be on the bullied to apologize to keep the peace. Put the onus on the ones responsible for the lack of peace to begin with.\n\nNTA", "NTA sounds like you were just being a good mom (playing/cuddling your kid) and quiet frankly karma's a...well ya know. Don't appologize you're probably better off without either one in your life", "NTA, you shouldn't have to stop being a good mum when you're around your cousin and aunt. After what they did to you as a teenager maybe this is their punishment. Definitely don't apologise for showing your daughter love.", "NTA - I love it when people who go out of their way to make others feel like trash get their karma payback. First you are allowed to be happy with your family. Just because she cant have kids, doesnt mean that you have to hide your family. And it sounds like she doesnt like not having the attention of everyone around her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCongrats on the baby BTW", "NTA. You are owed an apology. A big one. No, that won't magically make her problems go away but my god... you're owed basic human decency. I also don't think you were rubbing anything in her face?? You showed your mum a scan photo. Unless there's a chunk of the story missing here, I cant see what you did wrong. They'd have found out about the baby anyway and then you'd have had it in the neck for not telling them. Looks to me like they were always going to find a way to make you feel shitty. \nCongratulations on your new pregnancy. Sending you lots of love and best wishes xxxx", "NTA. You have nothing to do with her infertility; you are neither its cause nor withholding its solution. If she cannot even stand to be in a room when such news is announced, she should seek help. You wanted to announce your pregnancy around family and you didn't know she would have this reaction. It's not like you got pregnant just to spite her in some form of petty revenge, you lived your life as you wanted to, so let her deal with her own feelings.", "I would avoid taking the kids around toxic people, why are you even wanting to interact with them after this? So your kids can get the same treatment?", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and only responded after your aunt attacked you yet again.\n\nI get that your cousin is dealing with a lot.  I understand why she left.  But for her mother to then say you needed to apologize\u2026 for what?  Doing normal life?", "Nta. Infertility probably isn't her fault and it isn't your fault either. You are showing off by having kids.", "NA\n\nt\n\nDON'T apologize for having a kid.

I would have told f***off", "Nta, you were at your moms birthday party, giving her a present that she'll be grandma again, it had nothing to do with your cousin, and she make it all about herself", "No way. NTA.\n\nWhy should you skirt around her feelings and be extra sensitive to her when she didn't give a rat's ass how you felt when she was being an AH?", "Awwww\u2026. Love it: karma strikes again\u2026\n\nNTA", "NAH - there is absolutely nothing wrong with what you have done, you have a new baby, you're supposed to do all those things.\n\n*(Note, I'm not going to revel in karma or whatever given her past treatment of you either, you were both kids, she was being a stupid kid acting without thinking. Yes, that kind of thing leaves scars, I know too well, and I understand your resentment of her, which is wholly deserved.  She's now learning that she'll never have what you have, and that's a horrific pain, regardless of whether she was shitty to you as a teenager or not, and we're not judging based on something that happened years ago when you were kids, but rather what is happening NOW as you're adults, and while you don't have a close relationship, you admit that your families have made up mostly and you're at least cordial).*\n\nI would have said that your cousin is a bit of an asshole here, but her reaction and pain are very real, and very devastating, so I kinda get that reaction too.  All I ever wanted in life was to have kids. That was my ONLY real life's dream.  My wife is also not able to get pregnant, despite us trying for years and years and years, and even going through IVF unsuccessfully.  I can tell you that even for me, that pain is very real and I feel gutted every time I see some happy parent with their child, or even TB shows and moves that focus on a parent/child dynamic.  My wife feels even worse.  Being unable to get pregnant has led to depression and  horrible self esteem as she blames herself for what her body won't do (something completely out of her control). She even contemplated leaving me at one point because she was certain I, in her words, \"deserved someone who was whole and can give you that child you want\".  It's had a huge effect on her for a long time and only within the last couple years has she really been able to put that past her.\n\nMy point from all this is that neither of you did wrong here.  You are understandably happy, are doing normal parent things with a new child, and your family are understandably happy for you and showing that.  Your cousin, likewise, while seeming to have a shitty reaction, likely feels that loss and pain every time she sees you and your baby, or any parent/child out there, and I'm willing to bet takes it as a personal failure that she hasn't been able to get pregnant.  It's ultimately, however, something she needs to sort out on her own, that's the only way.\n\nCongrats on the new child... make the most of it, for those of us who will never have that chance.", "I think NTA but..   the only way you're in the wrong here is if there's more to the story and you have some bad feelings towards this family member and indulge in having children in a passive-aggressive way in front of her to make her feel bad. You're the only person that knows if that's your intention or not. As long as it's not you're totally in the good. Obviously, if somebody wants kids and can't have them it's very difficult and how much you accommodate that is up to you but you should be able to enjoy having young children and bringing them to the family.", "NTA Do not apologise for not doing anything wrong, or for things you have absolutely no control over. If you start doing that you will become a target for being lashed out on, a scapegoat. Be careful of the motives of those who are trying to make you say sorry for things you haven't done. Are they trying to control you, make you a doormat? Are they using you as a sacrifice to appease the feelings of others because they care more about the other person's feelings than yours? Do they want to look better in the other person's eyes so they don't care how much they hurt you in the process? If you do not agree with what other people are saying, always look to reasons why they might have said it. It is usually more than 'keep the peace', that is just their excuse to you to make you do what they want.", "You're NTA for being cuddly with your daughter but I think you A T A for revealing a pregnancy at someone else's celebration. I understand that this might be a rare occasion get together but you should have asked prior to the person being celebrated.\nYour cousin is being a spoiled brat by thinking her actions have no consequences. Her mom is too. They bullied you about your pregnancy and told you you should END A LIFE. Now that they know cousin is infertile they are hating everything to do with babies because they are jealous. They are especially jealous of you because they probably think they could have avoided the situation had you gone trough the termination of your pregnancy as they wanted.\nYour cousin had a ton of problems that could be dealt with with a ton of physiological treatment. The grieving for the end of her marriage, the grieving for the babies she won't have are the main ones, but I'm pretty sure she has way more issues that she's not dealing with.\nCongratulations on your pregnancy and hoping you have a safe delivery and a healthy baby! \ud83d\ude18", "ESH. I think teenagers tend to be awful in general, you all are 17 and your brains aren\u2019t fully formed, you tend to be ding dongs to each other without even realizing you\u2019re being \u201cactually\u201d mean, because life isn\u2019t real to you yet. Your cousin should definitely apologize to you in private, away from your daughter\u2019s ears. \n\nBut you\u2019re 23 and an adult now (though you\u2019ve got two more years for your prefrontal cortex to finish) and you\u2019re being very cruel on your own. It may be different in your culture, but in mine, showing your bebe scans at someone else\u2019s party, even if it IS the grandma, is attention-seeking and selfish (because 1. It\u2019s your mom\u2019s party, not yours, let her have the spotlight and 2. Nothing can compete with a new baby! So everyone else feels like their presents suck in comparison, like how you don\u2019t give a Bentley at a birthday, you give it after the party so no one feels like a sucky present-giver and the party remains Grandma\u2019s Birthday Party and not That Party Where OP Announced She Was Pregnant/Gave A Bentley). \n\nSo I agree with your family about being more sensitive, I don\u2019t know if you need to apologize. But you can definitely be the grown up in this situation and be more thoughtful about announcing pregnancies at group gatherings when someone is going through fresh infertility.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
