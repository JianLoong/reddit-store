I was subject to relentless bullying from classmates, teachers random adults. My cousin attended the same high school as me and was in the same year, and was considered popular among our peers.

My parents ended up falling out with them over this so it was minimum contact for years. \n\nMy life was miserable because of them mostly but I got through it. My then boyfriend got a job and I did my degree online while working part time and we got through it. We are now married, and both have very well paying jobs.

Our families eventually made up too through our grandparents though this is fairly recent, and I don\u2019t see my cousin that much as I do resent her. \n\nMy cousin is unable to get pregnant and is medically infertile. Her and her husband tried for a long time and her husband recently left her because he wants biological kids. She is understandably devastated. \n\nIt was my mothers birthday and the whole family attended the get together. I showed my mom the scans and revealed the pregnancy at the party. My mother and everyone else was overjoyed. My cousin didn\u2019t say much, neither did her mom, but I thought that\u2019s fair enough. Later on I was cuddling my daughter and being silly with her, and everyone was telling me how lovely she is and how lucky I am. \nMy cousin got up, left and slammed the door. Everyone said to let her sulk, so her mum took her side and said I was being super insensitive and should apologise. I told her I still haven\u2019t received an apology for their abortion and slut comments so I won\u2019t be apologising to anyone, so she left too. \n\nMy family is divided.

And it sounds like she doesnt like not having the attention of everyone around her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCongrats on the baby BTW", "NTA. You are owed an apology. A big one. No, that won't magically make her problems go away but my god... you're owed basic human decency. I also don't think you were rubbing anything in her face?? You showed your mum a scan photo. Unless there's a chunk of the story missing here, I cant see what you did wrong. They'd have found out about the baby anyway and then you'd have had it in the neck for not telling them.

You have nothing to do with her infertility; you are neither its cause nor withholding its solution. If she cannot even stand to be in a room when such news is announced, she should seek help.

Yes, that kind of thing leaves scars, I know too well, and I understand your resentment of her, which is wholly deserved.  She's now learning that she'll never have what you have, and that's a horrific pain, regardless of whether she was shitty to you as a teenager or not, and we're not judging based on something that happened years ago when you were kids, but rather what is happening NOW as you're adults, and while you don't have a close relationship, you admit that your families have made up mostly and you're at least cordial).*\n\nI would have said that your cousin is a bit of an asshole here, but her reaction and pain are very real, and very devastating, so I kinda get that reaction too.  All I ever wanted in life was to have kids. That was my ONLY real life's dream.  My wife is also not able to get pregnant, despite us trying for years and years and years, and even going through IVF unsuccessfully.  I can tell you that even for me, that pain is very real and I feel gutted every time I see some happy parent with their child, or even TB shows and moves that focus on a parent/child dynamic.  My wife feels even worse.  Being unable to get pregnant has led to depression and  horrible self esteem as she blames herself for what her body won't do (something completely out of her control). She even contemplated leaving me at one point because she was certain I, in her words, \"deserved someone who was whole and can give you that child you want\".  It's had a huge effect on her for a long time and only within the last couple years has she really been able to put that past her.\n\nMy point from all this is that neither of you did wrong here.  You are understandably happy, are doing normal parent things with a new child, and your family are understandably happy for you and showing that.  Your cousin, likewise, while seeming to have a shitty reaction, likely feels that loss and pain every time she sees you and your baby, or any parent/child out there, and I'm willing to bet takes it as a personal failure that she hasn't been able to get pregnant.  It's ultimately, however, something she needs to sort out on her own, that's the only way.\n\nCongrats on the new child... make the most of it, for those of us who will never have that chance.", "I think NTA but..   the only way you're in the wrong here is if there's more to the story and you have some bad feelings towards this family member and indulge in having children in a passive-aggressive way in front of her to make her feel bad. You're the only person that knows if that's your intention or not. As long as it's not you're totally in the good. Obviously, if somebody wants kids and can't have them it's very difficult and how much you accommodate that is up to you but you should be able to enjoy having young children and bringing them to the family.", "NTA Do not apologise for not doing anything wrong, or for things you have absolutely no control over. If you start doing that you will become a target for being lashed out on, a scapegoat. Be careful of the motives of those who are trying to make you say sorry for things you haven't done. Are they trying to control you, make you a doormat? Are they using you as a sacrifice to appease the feelings of others because they care more about the other person's feelings than yours? Do they want to look better in the other person's eyes so they don't care how much they hurt you in the process? If you do not agree with what other people are saying, always look to reasons why they might have said it. It is usually more than 'keep the peace', that is just their excuse to you to make you do what they want.", "You're NTA for being cuddly with your daughter but I think you A T A for revealing a pregnancy at someone else's celebration. I understand that this might be a rare occasion get together but you should have asked prior to the person being celebrated.\nYour cousin is being a spoiled brat by thinking her actions have no consequences. Her mom is too. They bullied you about your pregnancy and told you you should END A LIFE. Now that they know cousin is infertile they are hating everything to do with babies because they are jealous. They are especially jealous of you because they probably think they could have avoided the situation had you gone trough the termination of your pregnancy as they wanted.\nYour cousin had a ton of problems that could be dealt with with a ton of physiological treatment. The grieving for the end of her marriage, the grieving for the babies she won't have are the main ones, but I'm pretty sure she has way more issues that she's not dealing with.\nCongratulations on your pregnancy and hoping you have a safe delivery and a healthy baby! \ud83d\ude18", "ESH. I think teenagers tend to be awful in general, you all are 17 and your brains aren\u2019t fully formed, you tend to be ding dongs to each other without even realizing you\u2019re being \u201cactually\u201d mean, because life isn\u2019t real to you yet. Your cousin should definitely apologize to you in private, away from your daughter\u2019s ears. \n\nBut you\u2019re 23 and an adult now (though you\u2019ve got two more years for your prefrontal cortex to finish) and you\u2019re being very cruel on your own. It may be different in your culture, but in mine, showing your bebe scans at someone else\u2019s party, even if it IS the grandma, is attention-seeking and selfish (because 1. It\u2019s your mom\u2019s party, not yours, let her have the spotlight and 2. Nothing can compete with a new baby! So everyone else feels like their presents suck in comparison, like how you don\u2019t give a Bentley at a birthday, you give it after the party so no one feels like a sucky present-giver and the party remains Grandma\u2019s Birthday Party and not That Party Where OP Announced She Was Pregnant/Gave A Bentley). \n\nSo I agree with your family about being more sensitive, I don\u2019t know if you need to apologize.

I would similarly say \u201cin my culture, you don\u2019t wear white to other people\u2019s weddings.\u201d I do not think that\u2019s the superior way, it\u2019s just hey if you\u2019re going to a western wedding, def don\u2019t wear white or people will think you\u2019re rude. \n\nYou have taken every single thing I said and thrown it into a completely different field altogether, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so heart set on finding me offensive, but I do think you could stand to have a little better reading comprehension - it would save you a lot of anger. < that was condescending, I will admit.", "Aw, thank you", "It's not extrapolations, I'm just telling you how you come across. I'm sorry if you don't like it.\n\nAnd by the way, you're condescending again in this very comment - point 2, to be specific. OP's an adult, but you somehow insist on treating her like she's a child who's just too dumb to realise what she's done. \n\nOh, and nice touch calling her mean and cruel. Way to make her feel guilty, then say \"but you shouldn't feel guilty about it, you're just not clever enough yet to understand what you're doing\".\n\nAlso, what makes you think I'm angry? I'm pointing out that you sound rude, I'm not sure why you immediately imagine that I'm foaming at the mouth and spitting with rage. My prefrontal cortex is fully formed, I'm perfectly capable of handling a debate. It baffles me when people think they're so important that they can somehow induce rage over the Internet \ud83d\ude44", "OP surprised her own mother. The cousin needs to be able to handle other people being pregnant. The cousin got upset at the pregnancy AND at OP playing with her daughter. \n\nShould OP not have told her mother, who was so happy to be told then, and stop playing with her own child? That's the compromise you keep talking about. That sounds an awful lot like hiding pregnancy and ignoring your own child.\n\n Totally centered around the cousin who is barely acting civil after years of abuse. Think we found the entitled Aunt.", "You're welcome.", "I will not. I believe in what I say and re read before adding comment. That\u2019s how I interpreted your comment and I will not delete it. Once again showing how entitled you are to what others do.", "You literally misread and you\u2019re calling it \u201cinterpreted?\u201d I said \u201cpregnancy announcement at a birthday party.\u201d I said nothing about hiding children. This is how information and rage gets spread and you\u2019re totally fine with it? Ok.\n\nFinally, you keep misusing the word \u201centitled.\u201d I am entitled to what other people do, in that I think I am allowed to do what they do. Is this wrong? I don\u2019t think so. Are you trying to say that you think I\u2019m \u201centitled for thinking birthday parties aren\u2019t baby announcement parties?\u201d Because that would be partially accurate, but it would depend on the cultural norms. Regardless, please look it up, because you\u2019re flinging it around willy-nilly and I have a strong suspicion you should be using \u201cthis person thinks differently from me and I can\u2019t respect that\u201d instead.", "Tbh I\u2019m done replying. You\u2019re not someone I want to engage with. Have a good day."]}
