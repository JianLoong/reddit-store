{"id": 8731, "submission_id": "10pi6rk", "title": "AITA for considering making my mom and sister homeless?", "selftext": "I (19 f) live with my mom (48 f) and little sister (15 f) in an apartment. I go to college, have a job, take care of all my responsibilities around the house, and pay rent. I clean up after myself and everyone else when she doesn't want to. Even though I pay rent, my mom still treats me like a child and expects me to follow all her rules. This included going to her church and church activities until I had to start working more and needed to change my schedule for college. The rules also include a curfew, and strict rules about going out or having people home. I have to ask permission and can be denied for any reason. Ex: I have a gf, and I'm not allowed to do anything more than hold her hand if I bring her over. We have to be watched and I'm not allowed over there unless someone else is home at both her house and mine. I've told her that I would like to be treated more as an adult but she refuses saying it's her house therefore her rules. I'm supposed to get child support to cover the cost of college but it goes straight to my mom for rent, so I think I should be treated more like a roommate because I technically am. My gf is moving to a city I've always loved for college in the fall, it's quite a few hours away, but it's beautiful and a lot warmer than it is here. I'm honestly considering moving down there with her. My job is easily transferable down there and I could enroll at the same college or take classes online. But if I move my mom will lose my child support and since the apartment has 3 bedrooms she could lose the apartment too. I don't want to leave them homeless, but I need some independence and would like to remain close to gf. My friend said I would be because my little sister did nothing wrong and needs a roof over her head.

Tell her as you are an adult, and because she has given you the ultimatum of \"it's her house and her rules\" , you believe that you should move out. Make sure to include that as you contribute to the bills but get treated as a child it is not a healthy environment for you.\n\nIf she argues and makes a scene and or threats, end the conversation on the spot and say \"I'm sorry you are unable to be an adult about this.\"\n\nMake sure you have all important documents (birth certificate social security card and anything else) in your possession first, as she might try to keep them from you.", "NTA\n\nDon't put your life on hold out of fear your mother is going to lose the child support.

It\u2019s time you get some independence. Sure, your sister didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but your mom will either need to pay the rent on her own or look into other options, including government assistance or cheaper housing.

You're not obligated to subvert your existence to supporting your mother. You would be the asshole if you did this overnight and she became homeless. But if you tell her about this, plan it out, and are firm, you would not be the asshole. Unless your mother is unable to work, she should find a way to support herself and your sister without your child support. \n\nI don't for a moment think this will be easy for you. It sounds like there's some deep homophobia here, so your moving out would have consequences for your future relationship with your family. If you want to do this, give her a firm date a short time in the future: two months. Enough time to find a job, not enough time to destroy your own life (hopefully).

But you are an adult now, you have a way out, and you don't have to let her continue. And when your sister is ready to move out too, she'll benefit a lot from having watched you do it, and having you to go to for support outside of mom's control.

Easy!", "If you at 19 are making more money  than your mother then she is purposely under employed. It is not your responsibility to support her household.

You are an adult and paying a portion of the rent so you should be able to live your own life as you want and have equal treatment.  Discuss this with your mother that you intend to move out since you are treated as a child at home despite paying your portion of rent and bills.  If there is no compromise from her then she absolutely knows what comes next and will be able to prepare for it.  If you just up and leave without any prior notification to her so that she can appropriately plan then I would say that you would indeed be the AH as their current plans are based around you being there necessitating a larger space and higher cost which you help offset.  With planning they can move to a smaller place within their budget since they would have all the facts.", "NTA - 1) Your an adult and should be able to move out of your mothers home 2) She is responsible for putting a roof over your sisters head not you 3) No reason to assume Mother couldn't find other accommodations so you would hardly be making them homeless 4) Sounds like you need to get out from an unhealthy environment for you.", "NTA - it's her job as an adult to provide for herself and her children.

Since you won't be going til the fall I would have that conversation NOW to give your mom the most time to make plans. She may decide to get a smaller apartment since she won't need the extra room and will have time to figure out the finances - if you're in the US and the support continues it should transfer to you. Be prepared for arguments, etc.. but just keep moving. If your mom presses you do not argue, defend or discuss. Just a gentle I'm sorry you feel that way, but I will be leaving in the fall.
