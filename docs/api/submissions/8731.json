I go to college, have a job, take care of all my responsibilities around the house, and pay rent. I clean up after myself and everyone else when she doesn't want to. Even though I pay rent, my mom still treats me like a child and expects me to follow all her rules. This included going to her church and church activities until I had to start working more and needed to change my schedule for college. The rules also include a curfew, and strict rules about going out or having people home. I have to ask permission and can be denied for any reason. Ex: I have a gf, and I'm not allowed to do anything more than hold her hand if I bring her over. We have to be watched and I'm not allowed over there unless someone else is home at both her house and mine. I've told her that I would like to be treated more as an adult but she refuses saying it's her house therefore her rules. I'm supposed to get child support to cover the cost of college but it goes straight to my mom for rent, so I think I should be treated more like a roommate because I technically am. My gf is moving to a city I've always loved for college in the fall, it's quite a few hours away, but it's beautiful and a lot warmer than it is here. I'm honestly considering moving down there with her. My job is easily transferable down there and I could enroll at the same college or take classes online. But if I move my mom will lose my child support and since the apartment has 3 bedrooms she could lose the apartment too. I don't want to leave them homeless, but I need some independence and would like to remain close to gf.
