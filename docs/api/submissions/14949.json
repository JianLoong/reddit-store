Adam is known to be kind of a dick when he\u2019s drunk so the first two times I let it slide but by the third, I was pissed. \n\nI messaged my boyfriend, I kindly told him how we all felt and hoped he could maybe talk to Adam in order the get this sorted out, we could then carry on enjoying our night.\n\nMy boyfriend told me to \u201cjust carry on with the game\u201d but every time I tried, guess who swooped in to cut me off like I was a split end?

The only thing I got from him was \u201cok see you later\u201d.\n\nThe place that we went clubbing was not safe. He was happy to leave me stranded and in danger trying to find my own way home, alone. And I know this because when I turned around he was in the club looking for his lads.\n\nI messaged the girls telling them I was going home and They convinced me just ignore him because why should I sacrifice the night I had spent so long planning.\n\nI went into the club and after having a small mental breakdown in the club toilets I came out and a group of out mutual friends came and danced with me. I made sure to stay at the opposite end of the club.\n\nI saw him in passing but he mostly just ignored me and if he wasn\u2019t ignoring me, he just gave me a dirty look and walked away with some of the guys.\n\nAITA for feeling under appreciated and hurt?
