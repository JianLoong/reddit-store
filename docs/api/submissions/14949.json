Adam is known to be kind of a dick when he\u2019s drunk so the first two times I let it slide but by the third, I was pissed. \n\nI messaged my boyfriend, I kindly told him how we all felt and hoped he could maybe talk to Adam in order the get this sorted out, we could then carry on enjoying our night.\n\nMy boyfriend told me to \u201cjust carry on with the game\u201d but every time I tried, guess who swooped in to cut me off like I was a split end?

I made sure to stay at the opposite end of the club.\n\nI saw him in passing but he mostly just ignored me and if he wasn\u2019t ignoring me, he just gave me a dirty look and walked away with some of the guys.\n\nAITA for feeling under appreciated and hurt?

He will reach out to her but she will be happily married. The end.", "Yes, and remember you ARE important to us. Look at all the responses!", "I am a Welsh woman. Tell him none of us want him there. We had a meeting and it was unanimous! \n\nNTA and please do come and visit our beautiful country again with someone who doesn't have such an ugly ass personality. \n\nSending you strength OP. And a big Welsh cwtch (hug). X", "From wales. Can confirm.", "Honey, enough is enough. Look at this as a learning experience, set him free to wallow in asshole land, and live your best life.", " like so many people of Reddit will. What I will tell you is this might be a red flag that you really need to keep a tight eye on.", "I\u2019m not from Wales, but my late grandmother is. If she were here today, she\u2019d fully agree with this. Nobody in Wales needs to be subjected to this guy. But then, nobody *anywhere* needs that really either. \n\nNTA OP. He\u2019s a prick and you deserve better. As for your bf, he and Adam deserve each other. I hope they make one another very (un)happy.", "YTA for that lie: \"I turn to my boyfriend for guidance and support.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are certainly not interested in his guidance. YOu just want to shirk the responsibilities that come with being an adult.", "Oml NTA!!! I don\u2019t mean to insult you when I say this, but your boyfriend sounds disgusting. He may not always be like this, but that kind of revolting, misogynistic behavior is telling and absolutely grounds to dump his sorry a$$. I don\u2019t say that automatically because I know it\u2019s much harder said than done but girl you deserve so much better. That\u2019s just such nasty behavior ugh \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA\u2026honey, please dump him.  You are soooo much better than him and you deserve so much more.", "NTA", "NTA. The key part here is him saying \"no one in that room thinks you\u2019re important.\" He can't know that. Those are his true feelings regarding you.\n\nDump his ass.", "He should be your ex boyfriend now. He has told you you're not important in words and actions.", "NTA- when people tell you who they are, you should listen", "Your ex is more of a jerk than Adam was. But they're both jerks.\n\nOP is NTA", "NTA. Dump the jerk! I am not autistic and let me tell you, any guy that says you are not important should be an EX. My jaw was on the floor when I read that!", "This dude has shown how little he cares about you. Nta. Please leave him in the dust.", "We only have OP opnion he was being misogynistic. Who is by her ownadmission autistic. What she says is adam interrupted some girls stories. With no real details in what ways. Was he asking questions, was he flirting? Was OP completly misconstruing the situation? \n\nTheres no details whatsover that any other girl was annoyed by it. As if they were OP would surely mention it in their post to support their POV.\n\nSo lets consider this. What really happened is one of OP's bf's friends was probably socializing with girls, OP misunderstood it and tried to get her boyfriend to confront one of his friends, during his birthday party, likely ruining the whole night, becasue she doesnt like him. BF refused as he was probaly confused by the whole thing or wanted to stay out of it (as their was likely already history between adam and OP she has decided not to mention, and you can maybe imagine why) ans then OP decided to strop off at thr night club becasue she wasnt gwtting her way, and when her boyfriend just said \"ok cool\" and didnt play into her drama thst makes him the bady guy? \n\nIts clear OP is at least an unrelaibke narrator in my opinion. I wonder what this night was actually like to somone else there. Im willing to bet Adam isnt misogynistic and was likely just more engaged with the the womens stories.\n\nIm willing to bet OP is a massive drama queen and ages ruined many events before and her bf is sick of it. Hence, why he just let her wander away.", "I don\u2019t think this guy even *likes* you, let alone *loves* you. It seems like he can hardly tolerate you. He literally told you point blank, to your face, that he doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re important. I\u2019d have dumped him on the spot.", "As I already said, we tried to talk with Adam previously but he ignored us, I turned to my boyfriend about how to a) handle it, or b) help me to fix it, there was no malice. Just a situation my autistic self didn\u2019t know how to handle and going to the person I thought I could go to for help.", "Yeah. He is fine not to give in to your bullying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I turned to my boyfriend about how to a) handle it,\" .. And he TOLD you howe to handle it .. you attacked him for doing that.", "Exactly.", "Exactly. Which makes the bf an enormous AH.", "He definitely didn\u2019t tell me how to handle it, he told me how to present the disrespect wasn\u2019t happening.", "YTA and Hes TA,\n\nIts his birthday and you let Adam cutting you off while speaking be the single biggest focus of your BFs 21st birthday. Instead of handling the situation yourself you tried to force your BF into the middle of you being mad at Adam while its your BFs 21st birthday. You all decide to go to the club and at this point Adam interrupting stories is no longer an issue but instead of letting you being upset die down you used the situation of being outside with your BF to bring up you being upset again. You chose your feelings of being upset that you were being cut off over the feelings of your BF having a fun drama free 21st birthday. IMO that to a certain extent makes YTA. After that happens your BFs words makes him an asshole. The older you get you realize that theres a time and place for everything and i dont think that was the right time. Yes Adam may have started this all but how you handled it made it worse.", "NTA-why are you still with someone that tells you you\u2019re not important?", "NTA and any bf who treats you like that should definitely be tossed! I know you don\u2019t like confrontation so wait for a time he\u2019s out, pack up your stuff and get out of there. I\u2019d also cancel the trip, that jerk doesn\u2019t deserve it or you!", "\"no one in that room thinks you\u2019re important\".  This is the cue to not let him hear your voice addressing him again.", "Have you considered the possibility that your boyfriend is a friend to Adam because they understand each other and share values?  Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t appear to value you though and treated you like an annoyance. Perhaps he wants a girlfriend, finds you attractive on his arm, likes that you go to a lot of trouble and expense  to please him so he hangs on to you and pretends to have something in common with you. How many Reddits have you read about people like that and the heartbreak that follows when they turn out to be uncaring and to not have your back. How many people get married or pregnant only to find out the partner has changed overnight.  \n\nLook at the difference between the way you care for him and how he cares for you.  How his friend behaves and how he defends that behavior; how he was willing to leave you in a risky spot that night.  \n\nThen ask yourself why you place such a much higher value on him than he places on you?  Do you really believe he is the best you can do?", "When your bf said no one in that room thinks you\u2019re important, \u201cPeople in that room\u201d includes himself. DUMP HIM!!", "Auti to auti: The way he's treating you is NOT NORMAL. He may try to act like it is and like you're being irrational because of your autism but a good boyfriend would take your feelings into consideration. Leave, he's not looking out for you and he clearly puts his friends above you when you should be equal with or even above them in certain cases. NTA, but seriously, leave.", "NTA. My boyfriend and I have an \"Adam\". Sounds so uncanny. Only difference is if my boyfriend reacted the way yours did he knows his stuff would be out in the rain. You did all this wonderful stuff for his birthday and he had the audacity to tell you that you weren't important? Nuh uh honey all that awesome stuff you do for him, you should do for you. Let he and Adam be together boo. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA but E-S-H if you stay with someone who treats you like that", "NTA\n\nThere's a joke that if 10 people sit down at a table with a Nazi, then there are 11 Nazis sat down at that table.\n\nYour BF just told you who he was.\n\nBelieve him.\n\nHe makes being single sound so much better.", "This is where being an asshole ends a relationship on the spot\n\nCancel that wales trip and OP can also cancel her relationship with him", "ESH.\n\nI assume a 21st is a \u201cmilestone\u201d birthday in the UK as it is in Australia.  This isn\u2019t just a regular event for the BF - only happens once.\n\nNow Adam was being an A H. I don\u2019t know why it had to be your BF out of everyone (male and female) at the party to police his behaviour but you made Adam\u2019s problem your boyfriends.  You texted him and then he (I assume texted back) \u201ccarry on\u201d.  So far so good for both of you.  You wanted him to act but it\u2019s his birthday so understandable he doesn\u2019t want to be the one when there are plenty of other adults present.\n\nHere\u2019s where you join the A H club.  You bring up the drama whilst waiting in line.  Why? He\u2019s stated his position on this and now you are literally starting a fight (cos that\u2019s what happened).  Then the whole drama of threatening to leave and it\u2019s unsafe.  That\u2019s again just drama and being an A H on an event that\u2019s not about you.  \n\nBoyfriend said some unkind things and sulked so he is an A H too, but remember if you hadn\u2019t of picked a fight you wouldn\u2019t have that unfold.\n\nESH.", "Assault isn't an acceptable response.", "Another Welshy here and agree we don\u2019t want him! OP more than welcome!", "The way you're more willing to believe in your own made up scenario than the one presented to you, and the fact that you hold OP being autistic against her is very telling. BTW, men interrupting women when they speak IS misogynistic. He did not give the women in that group the same respect to shut up and listen the way he did for the men. Only someone misogynistic will not see that.\n\nThe actual facts we do know from what OP said is that she organized the birthday celebration for her ungrateful (hopefully soon to be ex) boyfriend, and planned an additional trip to another country for him as well. You would think a decent boyfriend with such a thoughtful girlfriend at the very very least would want his own girlfriend comfortable and safe in the very party she organized. And regardless of the scenario, as the birthday boy and the one people would cater to the most, he had the power to tell Adam to stop being an obnoxious little shit without escalating the situation so that everyone is having fun.\n\nAlso he didn't just say \"ok cool\", he said \"No one there thinks you're that important.\", which is both cruel (Is she at the very least not important to him? Does her safety and comfort mean less than him having a good time?) and proven false by the way their other (girl) friends were able to comfort her and lighten up her mood enough to get her to dance.\n\nAnyway, NTA, OP. Find a man that will prioritize your comfort over him having fun.", "The fact your are perfectly willing to make OP exactly at her word really shows your gullibility, lack of emotional intelligence and ignorance. Do you not know anything about autism? You are aware that misunderstanding soscila mores are one of its main symtombs?\n\nReally interrupting a long stream of conciouness, with say a question or joke or comment is always misogynistic because theyre women? You must be fun at parties. Its more than likely he was just not paying attention to the mens stories or talking to someone else. Becasue sitting in a circle with the whole party telling stories one by one sounds frankly incredibly unbelievable and if true very boring and likely OP in her autism completely misunderstood what was happening socially. \n\nThe ACTUAL facts of the matter is OP tried to incite drama in incredily selfish ways to derail his party and make herself the centre of attention. Im willing to bet she only organised that trip to boast she did so (like she did in the post) about what a great girlfriend she is. Plus  Im willing to bet they live in England or elsewhere in thr UK. Going on holliday to Wales isnt that impressive.plus organising what seems like a small scale flat party and outting to a club (which seems to have been decided last minute, which really says alot about how good the party was that she supposedley spend so much effeort organising, plus the main activity seemed to be sittting in a circle telling stories, if we take her word for it. Sounds like a really badly and under irgansied party doesnt it?)\n\nI hope she is a soon to be ex gf too. He can do alot better and his life will be much calmer and peaceful without her. He can likely do much much better. Not someone who boasts about doing what actually seems like near the bare minimum and then stirs up unneccsary drama and deliberately putting her bf in the middle of it. He could day that to his friend, but your still assuming OP is a relaible narrator, its clear her BF didnt agree with her assesment of the situation. \n\nMake sure shes \"comfortable and safe\"? She out herself in potentially harms way and made herself uncomfortable. Neither of which are his problem. She is a grown women. Not a child. Shes outting her own desrire for drama before his having fun and having a good bday. Which isnt a sign of a good gf is it? Plus, \"No one there thinks you're that important\" acrually says alot doesnt it. It suggests the truth of the matter that she was putting herself first and as the most important, not what she suggests happned. And where exactly does it say the other women confroted her?  It dpesnt say that at all in the post. If they ahd she would have mentioned it to try and show she was in the right. The fact she doesnt and they didnt, shows just who they thought was in the right and who was in the wrong. Intresting isnt it? And that she calmed herself down to dance. \n\nYTA OP. Leave him for his sake so he can find a womne who prioritises him over needless drama."]}
