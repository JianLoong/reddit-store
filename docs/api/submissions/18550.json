I don't even get how you are benefitting from it? Because she gives you a lift here and there? I'm sure if you'd use Uber or car sharing on that occasions it'd still be cheaper for you.", "NTA \n\nIf she wants the car to be hers, then she needs to shoulder the bills for it. The most you should be expected to pay for it is gas on road trips. \n\nI thought your original idea was pretty good actually. That way she doesn\u2019t have to do all the driving. But like you said, fair enough. Still, it\u2019s her car and her bills.

Add in that this car will be only in her name, then she pays the costs.  Take that $100 she wanted you to spend and add that to your 401k or Roth IRA.  You'll get a better return on investment.", "NTA. You don't have to pay for a good or service you are unable to use. She is correct that she will be driving you around when you are doing things together and that benefits you. But that's a choice she is making and also benefits her as well. You have no obligation to pay for someone else's stuff. Unless you were a regular user, then the previous agreement stands", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't get to tell you how much utility you think you're getting for the car. \n\nNo idea why she isn't adding you as a named driver. It doesn't make her car any less hers, but I guess that's up to her.", "NTA, her car, her money, her problem. If it was me, I would stay well away from it. Your money, your benefits, your choice. She has no say in how you wish to spend your money.", "NTA.\n\nIf the car is in her name, and you plan on using public transport, then it is really on her to cover her own car expenses.  If if she gave you a ride from time to time.  However, if you start using the car as well, then of course you can contribute to some car expenses.\n\nA lot of people just fill up the gas tank or something if the use is sporadic and for short distances.\n\nSince the car is in her name, and you are not married, you have no right to any value of the car if she were to break up with you or sell the car.", "nta, stand your ground but in respectful manner. hopefully she\u2019ll understand", "NTA. \nDon't give her one thin dime. She's trying to grift you here, poorly. \nGive her the keys to the curb.", "NTA.

It is ridiculous for her to expect you to pay for part of the car if you aren\u2019t allowed to drive it.", "NTA, reminds me of my ex, her car was HERS, my car was ours.

Figure out how to proceed in a way both of you can live with.", "NTA.  Offer to chip in for gas now and again if she takes you places.  Like you said, why would you pay down toward a car that you can't drive.", "NTA what benefits for you is she talking about?", "NTA.  If I cant use it, I\u2019m not paying for it. \n\nBut, I\u2019ll give you five bucks when I need a ride.", "NTA. I don\u2019t make people pay everytime I give them a lift.

Transport?", "This is hard. You will still benefit - I'm assuming it will be used for joint trips, probably some shopping will be easier. But you will always be at her mercy - you will only be able to benefit from the car when she chooses, and she will also be benefitting. You will always have to go to her for a ride if needed. \n\nOn the other hand, she is paying for the whole car on her own, so I can see why she may want to prevent you from frequently borrowing it. If you're on the insurance, it'll be a lot easier for you to use without her. I don't think anyone is the asshole yet.

No. NTA.\n\nMy husband and I have been together for over 15 years and married for over 14 years. Everything we have is shared even though I'm the primary financial provider.

Do both of you chip in for groceries? Trips that BOTH of you benefit from... the same questions apply here. \n\nIt would be ridiculous for her paying for her car and you paying for public transport to end up at the same place; that's kind of what she's suggesting should happen here by her specific restrictions and \"deal\" SHE decided on.", "Sounds like she feels that what\u2019s hers is hers, and what\u2019s yours is also hers.   \n\nErgo she feels entitled to your pay rise and to your money.

But it would be good to emphasize that if you guys go shopping together or take a weekend trip, you\u2019ll pay for all of the gas for those excursions.

Never knew how to feel about that.", "The way I see it is it's about choice.\n\nYou choose that arrangement, and it works. So that's fine. OP isn't choosing here. Even if something is technically a benefit it should be up to him whether he wants to pay for that benefit.", "So you want the convenience without the cost then?", "For me this mine and your money has never really been a thing in my marriage. We equitably contributed to everything once we moved in together and then once engaged everything went in one pot. He drives me around and picks things up in his car. As the cost comes from our money then I contribute to the car. He uses it far more and utilises it alone 50% of the time but I benefit.", "Then he should not benefit.

I'll be fine paying petrol some times but why should I pay towards the actual cost of a car I cannot drive and no not need?\n\nAnd you didn't answer my question, if I decide to buy a new bed, should my partner be forced to pay towards it despite her saying she's happy with the current one?", "Isn't that what OP is doing?", "Then don't benefit from the car. Take public transport on your trips, for your shopping, for the gym. She's not asking you to pay for half of the car is she? She's asking for a contribution as you will benefit from it and it will ease your life\n \nNot equivalent as you are not paying for half the car. Why are you deciding on the bed when you both sleep in it in your shared home?", "No he'll be getting transport to the gym, for groceries, for trips away", "Okay then if I bought a new bed and asked my partner to pay a monthly cost towards it, should she have to pay despite her not wanting it or would you suggest she sleeps on the floor?\n\nAgain why should you have to pay for a forced benefit?\n\nIt absolutely is equivalent, why is my gf deciding on a car that she expects other people to pay towards?", "Are you throwing out the bed against her wishes then? In your shared home?", "Yes in the example I gave I would be replacing something because I wanted to then because my gf gets to sleep in it asking for a monthly fee towards it. Using your logic if my gf benefits from it (sleeps in the bed) she should contribute towards it or not use the benefit. Do you see how ridiculous you sound. If you force a benefit on someone, why should they pay?"]}
