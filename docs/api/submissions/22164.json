Most libraries you can call the children\u2019s department and give them a topic and they will put together a pack of 5-6 books on the subject and you can just pop in and pick it up. (This is for you to read to them, don\u2019t let the books be damaged.)  Pick a new topic every week - frogs, dance, etc, or ask the librarian most love a little creative freedom.\n\n4. Do you have access to paper and crayons? Ask them to draw something specific so they have a direction to go in. Maybe something related to the book theme that week.\n\n5. Songs - google songs with motions.\n\n6. The I-spy game (this works with lots of ages).\n\nIf you are enthusiastic about what you are doing normally you can corral that chaos energy into what you want them to do. (Don\u2019t forget to praise, praise, praise them with each activity.)

First off, how you refer to the kids. If that's your attitude you should be working with children. Period. \n\nNow there are other things you can do besides screen time. I taught gym classes to the same age group. When we coudn't go outside I had to do activities in the class. We played simple games like say simon says. I taught them easy stretches and exercises.
