At the beginning, he was very helpful since I was recovering and it would hurt to walk at some points. When he returned to work, I felt that the help declined. He went back to work a week after our baby was born. I had to do what I could. During our baby\u2019s nap, I would wash his bottles, wash clothes, clean the house. At times, I would cook if the baby wasn\u2019t awake. When he noticed I started doing more, he would leave clothes on the floor, his shoes in different places. I would try my best to keep the room clean and tidy so it would be messy or dirty for the baby. He had nothing to do when he would come from work because everything would get done. \n\nMy maternity leave ended in January and I returned to work. I would work from 4am to 10am or sometimes 12pm. I would be very tired since I would also have to bathe the baby and put him down for night time. I was exhausted and he would complain about how exhausted he was. I would still get home from work and wash bottles and do other chores around the house. He would still come home and do nothing. I would cry from exhaustion, I would plead for his help, and I would receive nothing. He would make promises and I would end up doing the things he would promise he would do. \n\nAt that point was done, I was drained and saw no other resort. So I told my mother in law, his mom. I told her he didn\u2019t help with the baby when he would home from work, he wouldn\u2019t wash any bottles, he wouldn\u2019t help me fold any laundry. Etc. It took his mom telling him something about helping for him to actually do it. Fast forward to now, baby is now a couple months older And we are slowly going back to the same issue.

However, no one gets to come home and do nothing, and no one gets to leave their stuff wherever in expectation that the other will clean up after them. Any of that crap, I'd leave it for him to pick up, or start trashing it tbh. And if you need to leave, leave the baby with him, and go - get a drink, get your hair and nails done, shop, or just drive. Stay out until the baby should be in bed or as long as you can.
