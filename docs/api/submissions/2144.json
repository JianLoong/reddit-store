{"id": 2144, "submission_id": "yt9dsl", "title": "AITA for asking my bridesmaid to cut her hair for my wedding?", "selftext": "I (mid 20's F) am getting married. My fianc\u00e9 (late 20's M) and I are paying for everything for our bridal party as we want their support without anyone getting in debt for us as we know not all our friends are in as good a financial position as we are. However, I'm having a problem with how much it's going to cost to do the hair of one of my bridesmaids.\n\nThe bridesmaid (Adie, early 20's F) has extremely long, thick hair, past her knees. I don't think she has ever cut her hair. Adie is the best man\u2019s (late 20's M) wife who also has extremely long hair. Due to the length of her hair, the hairdresser's that I am using has advised that to do Adie's hair, it's going to cost double due to the current length as they will need to dedicate just one person to do Adie's hair as it will take much longer to do her hair. Another stylist will be able to do the hair of the other 3 bridesmaids in the same amount of time. We had a trial and it took 50 minutes to do Adie's hair compared to the 20 minutes each for the others. It didn't look as nice as the others due to how much hair was braided up. I don't want to have to pay for additional person because Adie's hair is ridiculously long. Adie's husband had already said he will cut his hair so that he looked neat but won\u2019t say when its getting cut. I asked Adie to also cut her hair to at least her waist so that it's of similar length to my other bridesmaids.\n\nAdie was upset when I asked her to cut her hair as she got upset and told me that I was being insensitive asking her to cut her hair as I know that she doesn't cut her hair for cultural reasons. I honestly thought this was a reasonable request. It's my wedding, surely, she wants to make me happy. Adie said it was one step too far for her as I had already asked her to not use her rosemary hair oil as I didn't want her to smell like a woody scented hippie at the wedding - the stuff stinks, but she swears by it for her hair. Adie suggested that she did her own hair, but I said no as I want my bridesmaids to all look the same and she'd look different if she did her own hair. I asked if she would pay the \u00a3200 that I'm being charged extra for her hair, and she's refused saying they can't afford it. Adie has said that I'm being a bridezilla, but I disagree. I don't think I'm being unreasonably. Adie has since spoken with her husband, and he's now told my fianc\u00e9 that he won't be cutting his hair either and will be instead putting it back nicely. He wasn't happy that I was 'pushing' Adie to cutting her hair. Fianc\u00e9 isn't bothered because he just wants his friend next to him, but I'm upset that they're not willing to do this one thing.\n\nI thought I would come to reddit to ask if I am being the asshole in this situation, just for an outsider opinion. Am I being an asshole? I don't think I am because it's not unreasonable to ask someone to do something for my wedding, but Adie thinks I am as she doesn't cut her hair.\n\nEdit: Ok, I realise I'm the asshole. I'm going to call Adie later and apologise for asking her to cut hair but ask her if she would prefer to just be a guest as I would like to have my bridesmaids all look the same.\n\nEdit 2: Ok, I get it. I'm the asshole and that my apology plan doesn't sound great. I'm going to talk with Adie and revisit the idea of her doing her own hair and maybe look for another style that would work better for all the different hair lengths and types my bridesmaids have. While I would like my bridesmaids to all look the same, I know it wasn't right to ask her to cut her hair or kick her out of the wedding. I asked her to be a bridesmaid as her husband is the best man - we aren't very close, but they are a package deal and I know he wouldn't want to walk down the aisle with anyone else. I respect that these are his boundaries, and I should have respected that with Adie. I have asked her not to use the oil just due to the fact she can be heavy handed with it and one of my bridesmaids is really sensitive to smells and it can be strong. When I asked her not to wear it, she was ok with it as she understood and didn't want to cause the other bridesmaid a migraine.\n\nEdit 3: I have spoken with Adie; I have apologised for asking her to cut her hair. I have offered to take her and her husband out for dinner next week as a way to apologise for my lack of judgement. I have asked Adie if she was still open to doing her own hair, if not I would pay the extra money. Adie said she would prefer to do her own hair, and we have agreed to do some hair trials next weekend to see if we can find a style that suits her. Adie has advised that her husband is still upset that I asked her to cut her hair as he felt as if I was being pushy, but she said he will calm down in time. Adie and I are also going for lunch in the week so we can get to know each other better, her husband adores her as she's a lovely person and I should get to know her as they are a big part of my fianc\u00e9's life. Thank you for opening my eyes reddit to how I was being. I'm hoping I can forge a friendship with Adie and not damage my fianc\u00e9's relationship with her and her husband.", "created_utc": 1668265280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt9dsl/aita_for_asking_my_bridesmaid_to_cut_her_hair_for/", "score": 645, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't sound to be supportive of her culture and lifestyle. If you are, it doesn't show in this post. \n\n\"It's my wedding, surely, she wants to make me happy.\": Wow. Very entitled. I'm sure she does want you to be happy, but it's absolutely not up to any human but yourself to make you happy on your wedding day. I'd assume the main cause of happiness should be the impending marriage to the one you love?\n\nWithout even bringing cultural differences into it, asking someone who's been growing their hair out, and probably lovingly tending it, for their entire life just to please you is mind blowing honestly. Hair takes a long time to grow and insane effort to care for, and it's usually very important to the identity of someone who has it that long. \n\nTo ignore the cultural reasons for someone presumably very close to you (as you've chosen her as a bridesmaid right?) to keep themselves a certain way is pretty close to bigotry, tbh. \"Your culture means so little to me that I'm going to ask you to put it aside for aesthetics,\" basically.\n\nI think the best way forward (if Adie still wants to be involved) would be to flick through some bridal magazines together and find something she's able to do herself that will compliment your/your bridesmaids hair. \n\nOtherwise, perhaps there is another hairdresser who could do just Adie's hair who is less expensive? Or could you choose a new style for all your bridesmaids that will work/be easier and less expensive in Adies hair (would probably then also be cheaper for everyone else)? Or at least consider paying for the extra time OR working out a split of the $200 that Adie can afford. \n\nI'd bet Adie feels awful right now. While I appreciate that it's somewhat commendable of you to take on all the bridal party expenses, this is pretty common when the members are of different income brackets/lower income brackets than the bride and groom, so that the couple can have things at their desired price point. \n\nIt's even probably okay to ask Adie if she's able to pay any of the extra, but it's also okay for her to say no.\n\nWhat's not okay is to ask her to cut her hair.", "YTA.\n\nHair that long takes YEARS to grow.

No one but you does. Stop expecting the world to focus on you for something that billions of people do. Like you're the inventor of weddings. Jeez.

My fianc\u00e9 (late 20's M) and I are paying for everything for our bridal party as we want their support without anyone getting in debt for us as we know not all our friends are in as good a financial position as we are. However, I'm having a problem with how much it's going to cost to do the hair of one of my bridesmaids.\n\nThe bridesmaid (Adie, early 20's F) has extremely long, thick hair, past her knees. I don't think she has ever cut her hair. Adie is the best man\u2019s (late 20's M) wife who also has extremely long hair. Due to the length of her hair, the hairdresser's that I am using has advised that to do Adie's hair, it's going to cost double due to the current length as they will need to dedicate just one person to do Adie's hair as it will take much longer to do her hair. Another stylist will be able to do the hair of the other 3 bridesmaids in the same amount of time. We had a trial and it took 50 minutes to do Adie's hair compared to the 20 minutes each for the others. It didn't look as nice as the others due to how much hair was braided up. I don't want to have to pay for additional person because Adie's hair is ridiculously long. Adie's husband had already said he will cut his hair so that he looked neat but won\u2019t say when its getting cut. I asked Adie to also cut her hair to at least her waist so that it's of similar length to my other bridesmaids.  \n\nAdie was upset when I asked her to cut her hair as she got upset and told me that I was being insensitive asking her to cut her hair as I know that she doesn't cut her hair for cultural reasons. I honestly thought this was a reasonable request. It's my wedding, surely, she wants to make me happy. Adie said it was one step too far for her as I had already asked her to not use her rosemary hair oil as I didn't want her to smell like a woody scented hippie at the wedding - the stuff stinks, but she swears by it for her hair. Adie suggested that she did her own hair, but I said no as I want my bridesmaids to all look the same and she'd look different if she did her own hair. I asked if she would pay the \u00a3200 that I'm being charged extra for her hair, and she's refused saying they can't afford it. Adie has said that I'm being a bridezilla, but I disagree. I don't think I'm being unreasonably. Adie has since spoken with her husband, and he's now told my fianc\u00e9 that he won't be cutting his hair either and will be instead putting it back nicely. He wasn't happy that I was 'pushing' Adie to cutting her hair. Fianc\u00e9 isn't bothered because he just wants his friend next to him, but I'm upset that they're not willing to do this one thing.  \n\nI thought I would come to reddit to ask if I am being the asshole in this situation, just for an outsider opinion. Am I being an asshole? I don't think I am because it's not unreasonable to ask someone to do something for my wedding, but Adie thinks I am as she doesn't cut her hair.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
