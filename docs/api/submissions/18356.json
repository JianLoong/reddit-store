Her best friend was coming into town for a wedding and asked to stay with us for a night. I said ok. We have a *very* small one-bedroom apartment, but didn't have a problem with her sleeping on the couch for one night.\n\nLast night, my girlfriend said her friend was planning on extending her stay for an entire week, and asked whether she could stay with us. She said that getting an AirBnb for a week would cost like $700, which is too expensive for her friend to afford. I refused, for a few reasons.\n\n* Our space is small, and we run a small online business, so a lot of our space is occupied by inventory. There is very little free room in our space. With two cats, it's already very cramped.\n* Girlfriend asked whether they could put a blow-up mattress at the foot of the bed. I said no. We don't have air conditioning, so I sleep without clothes. If I sleep with clothes on, my clothing gets drenched, which really exacerbates my eczema. So, she can't sleep in the room with us.\n* The only other place for her to sleep would be the couch. I keep unorthodox hours, though, and am usually up working til about 3 a.m. So, her friend would have to sleep on the couch in the living room while I'm awake nearby. Allegedly, her friend falls asleep quick and is a deep sleeper. Regardless, it's a big accommodation to make because it means I can't do anything other than use my computer for that time.\n* Her friend can stay at my parent's house for free, because they have tons of extra room. They live about 45 minutes from us (we live in the city center). It's far. But we could lend her the car, and her friend could just drive into the city each day. In my view, driving 90 minutes a day is certainly worth it to get free housing for a week.\n* My girlfriend wouldn't be ok with me bringing a friend to stay with us for that long. When I made that point, she mentioned that her friend \"doesn't have a lot of money,\" and theoretically she would feel better about one of my friends staying with us if they couldn't afford to stay elsewhere. This seems pretty selective, because she's making an exception for her friend.\n* Her friend doesn't like me. It's one of those things where her friend doesn't think my girlfriend should be with me. I don't care that much about her judgements, but I'm even less open to her staying with us for that long when I know she dislikes me.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685256889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ttobt/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_girlfriends_best/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
