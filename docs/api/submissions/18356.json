If the genders were reversed and we were taking about a man who disparages your relationship wanting to SLEEP IN YOYR BEDROOM, this wouldn\u2019t even be a conversation.

You agreed to one night when that was the ask.

Nowhere in there am I expecting someone to inconvenience themselves for my sake.", "NTA because you\u2019ve gone out of your way to be accomodating and offered her the car and your parents place.

It is not reasonable to have an individual sleep at the foot of your bed for a week for all the reasons you\u2019ve listed. \n\nIf she cannot afford to pay for a hotel or air bnb she, she should stick to the original 1 night plan and save for a real vacation in the future.", "House guest are like fish- they go off after a few days. 2-3 days max for me dawg.

It is deniable, but not pleasant.\n\nThe fact the GF doesn't like you makes me wonder why should would want to stay with you for a week, unless sh is gong to use that time to sabotage you relationship.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If the friend can\u2019t afford the trip, she should wait until she can. One night is a favor; a week is an imposition.", "NTA. A week is too long. Why can\u2019t gf just stay with her friend in the Airbnb and make it a fun trip?", "NTA. This won't work. Point period. If you want to avoid drama, compromise by letting her stay 1-2 more nights, but then she has to leave. You offered a very good alternative, which as a friend, I would have preferred about intruding into a relationship in a cramped housing situation.", "Nta.  She shouldnt extend her trip if she doesnt have funds.  She could also explore a hotel which would be far less costly than an airbnb, or she could reduce the number of days shes staying so she can afford it.\n\nNo one should have to feel uncomfortable in their own place to accommodate a guest who doesnt like them", "NTA. Being able to host people is a wonderful gift to give. But the idea there is that you give them a room, not you give up your living situation to accommodate them. It sounds like hosting her for a week would be a major inconvenience to you, and could wind up costing you more than $700 in lost productivity.\n\nAlso, the last point really cemented it for me. If you are aware enough of how this person feels about you, then it\u2019s really rich to be asked to put them up for a week. Of course, refusing likely means your Gf will hear even more about how she shouldn\u2019t be with you.\n\nOne possible solution, and it\u2019s not really ideal, would be to offer to offset the cost of her friend getting an AirBnB near you guys. You said it would cost her $700\u2026what if you helped and made the cost to her $500, for instance? It could solve some of these problems for you.", "YTA. The real reason is the very last one.

So getting a hotel means the girlfriend will be paying for it completely. Is the girlfriend willing to pay that sort of money for a staycation in her own city?\n\nThe solution OP suggested is a bit weird, but there isn't a lot of possible solution when working with a budget of zero that isn't letting the friend stay in the tiny apartment for a week", "It's bizarre that a GF and friend are being difficult...\n\nSorry, I had to laugh at that.", "He didn't say the budget was zero, he said she couldn't afford to stay in an Airbnb by herself for $700.

Thank you.", "Came here to say the same thing. Girlfriend asked originally, didn't get the answer she wanted and then figured she would just take the agreement and plan to stay the whole week anyways. Gf did not care about if bf said yes or no.", "Are you seriously suggesting people don\u2019t have a right to live where they want to live because it might inconvenience broke, unwanted guests who actively disrespect the host until they suddenly need to sleep in their bedroom for a week to take a vacation they can\u2019t afford?", "I'm taking it that the friend found OPs post.", "WTF is wrong with you?", "It sounds like hosting him for a week would be a major inconvenience for you, and could cost you over $700 in lost productivity.", "Maybe the friend wants to drive a wedge between them this way?", "The idea that your gf wants him to sleep on your bedroom floor is weird. If it is an emergency yes,", "Oop found the gfs friend", "That could be completely untrue. You have no way of knowing. My best friend used to tell me she didn't like my husband. Didn't give a reason. Years later she admitted she said that because I wasn't spending enough time with her anymore cuz I was busy with my partner. It wasn't anything they had done to my friend or to me she just wanted more time with me but she didn't know how to ask.", "He should go stay with his parents for the week and let his girlfriend spend some time with her friend. Problem solved.", "Ikr", "NTA. If she can't afford a week long vacation, then she does not get a vacation.", "Also not really that different from a lot of Air B&Bs where you stay in someone's house (except this one is very generously free).", "Why?", "Someone asking to come sleep in your bedroom at the foot of your bed for a week when they have alternate free sleeping arrangements that would work better for the host and be reasonable for the guest is indeed being difficult.\n\nOP isn\u2019t a hotel or hostel. He\u2019s under no obligation to give out free board in his own bedroom for a week just because someone else can\u2019t afford to take a vacation trip they want to take without utilizing his small home for a week.\n\nIf there was a guest bedroom and more space it would be understandable. But there isn\u2019t.\n\nThe fact that this is a person who doesn\u2019t treat him or his relationship with respect is just all the more reason to refuse.", "I was joking.\n\nGF and their friends often give the bf a difficult time. It's not bizarre behavior but rather common. That is what I was laughing at."]}
