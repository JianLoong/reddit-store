She said that getting an AirBnb for a week would cost like $700, which is too expensive for her friend to afford. I refused, for a few reasons.\n\n* Our space is small, and we run a small online business, so a lot of our space is occupied by inventory. There is very little free room in our space.

If I sleep with clothes on, my clothing gets drenched, which really exacerbates my eczema. So, she can't sleep in the room with us.\n* The only other place for her to sleep would be the couch. I keep unorthodox hours, though, and am usually up working til about 3 a.m. So, her friend would have to sleep on the couch in the living room while I'm awake nearby.

They live about 45 minutes from us (we live in the city center). It's far. But we could lend her the car, and her friend could just drive into the city each day. In my view, driving 90 minutes a day is certainly worth it to get free housing for a week.\n* My girlfriend wouldn't be ok with me bringing a friend to stay with us for that long. When I made that point, she mentioned that her friend \"doesn't have a lot of money,\" and theoretically she would feel better about one of my friends staying with us if they couldn't afford to stay elsewhere.

If the friend can\u2019t afford the trip, she should wait until she can. One night is a favor; a week is an imposition.", "NTA. A week is too long. Why can\u2019t gf just stay with her friend in the Airbnb and make it a fun trip?", "NTA. This won't work. Point period. If you want to avoid drama, compromise by letting her stay 1-2 more nights, but then she has to leave. You offered a very good alternative, which as a friend, I would have preferred about intruding into a relationship in a cramped housing situation.", "Nta.  She shouldnt extend her trip if she doesnt have funds.  She could also explore a hotel which would be far less costly than an airbnb, or she could reduce the number of days shes staying so she can afford it.\n\nNo one should have to feel uncomfortable in their own place to accommodate a guest who doesnt like them", "NTA. Being able to host people is a wonderful gift to give. But the idea there is that you give them a room, not you give up your living situation to accommodate them. It sounds like hosting her for a week would be a major inconvenience to you, and could wind up costing you more than $700 in lost productivity.\n\nAlso, the last point really cemented it for me. If you are aware enough of how this person feels about you, then it\u2019s really rich to be asked to put them up for a week. Of course, refusing likely means your Gf will hear even more about how she shouldn\u2019t be with you.\n\nOne possible solution, and it\u2019s not really ideal, would be to offer to offset the cost of her friend getting an AirBnB near you guys. You said it would cost her $700\u2026what if you helped and made the cost to her $500, for instance? It could solve some of these problems for you.", "YTA. The real reason is the very last one.

Is the girlfriend willing to pay that sort of money for a staycation in her own city?\n\nThe solution OP suggested is a bit weird, but there isn't a lot of possible solution when working with a budget of zero that isn't letting the friend stay in the tiny apartment for a week", "It's bizarre that a GF and friend are being difficult...\n\nSorry, I had to laugh at that.", "He didn't say the budget was zero, he said she couldn't afford to stay in an Airbnb by herself for $700.

But there isn\u2019t.\n\nThe fact that this is a person who doesn\u2019t treat him or his relationship with respect is just all the more reason to refuse.", "I was joking.\n\nGF and their friends often give the bf a difficult time.

That is what I was laughing at.", "100% NTA", "NTA, if you can't afford it & have no other options, then don't go.", "Nta\nShe can get a room for a week at an Extended Stay for half of that", "45 min is nothing.

Plus you offered an elegant solution, free and including a car!", "If she doesn\u2019t have lot of money then why did she extend her stay which cost more money to do\u2026", "Answer is no get a hotel or go home.

Nope.", "***Her friend doesn't like me. It's one of those things where her friend doesn't think my girlfriend should be with me***\n\nthis is literally all that matters tbh. doesn't matter if you have a 10 bedroom house and billions of dollars and all the time in the world, you do n ot have to and absolutely should never do major favors for someone who openly treats you like shit or makes it clear they dislike you. Then you throw in it's about your relationship, not just a friend not liking you, she thinks you're not good enough for her friend so like...yeah why would you wanna help her?  \n\n\nI'd tell your GF \"she thinks I'm not good enough anyway and a no good boyfriend would say no so I'm just giving her what she expects\"", "NTA. Those are plenty reasons to refuse. That stay looks like a drama waiting to explode. Living with someone you like in a cramped space can be trying, forget about someone who can barely stand you. Just let her know immediately that the week stay is a no-go, so she can either ask someone else or know that she will be returning home immediately after the wedding. \n\nBtw, the solution to stay with your parents isn't really a great option even if free. They are complete strangers to her and as you said, she doesn't even like you.

They shouldn't use Airbnb as the only option for a one week stay.\n\nNTA", "No lie there..I was just looking at a vacation spot the wife and I frequent, and an AirBnB (off the beaten path) was over $2k more than the chain motel on the main street for the same amount of time.

It is just super weird arrangement that makes zero sense.", "I\u2019ve had multiple friends and even my grandma take up my fil\u2019s offer to stay with him.

You have a ton of really good points.

Your girl would get 1 on 1 ti.e with her friend, you get some quality time with your folks, and in a week, it goes back to normal. \n\nThink of it as an avoidacation!", "Honestly the last point ought to be first on the list. When my wife and I first got together there were a couple of people in our circle who were really against it. Fine, whatever - but when we eventually moved in together, they were not welcome in our home. Sure, see your friends, but I\u2019m not spending time where I live with someone who tries to break up my relationship.\n\nNTA", "I'm cracking up, yeah OP is going above and beyond.

Otherwise, living by \u201cthe no vote always wins\u201d rule in the event of a tie is a bit of a downer. A little flexibility goes a long way.", "If she doesn't have the money why the hell is she even going to stay a week?

I certainly don\u2019t see the hypocrisy; she expressed a clearly equitable guideline, even if it is a narrow path through it. \n\nI guess in your view they should just break up?", "Ain\u2019t gonna lie stoped downvoting after the fists response but let\u2019s move on I get you I don\u2019t agree but I get your standpoint.
