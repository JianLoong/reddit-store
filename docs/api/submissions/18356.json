Her best friend was coming into town for a wedding and asked to stay with us for a night. I said ok. We have a *very* small one-bedroom apartment, but didn't have a problem with her sleeping on the couch for one night.\n\nLast night, my girlfriend said her friend was planning on extending her stay for an entire week, and asked whether she could stay with us. She said that getting an AirBnb for a week would cost like $700, which is too expensive for her friend to afford. I refused, for a few reasons.\n\n* Our space is small, and we run a small online business, so a lot of our space is occupied by inventory. There is very little free room in our space. With two cats, it's already very cramped.\n* Girlfriend asked whether they could put a blow-up mattress at the foot of the bed. I said no. We don't have air conditioning, so I sleep without clothes. If I sleep with clothes on, my clothing gets drenched, which really exacerbates my eczema. So, she can't sleep in the room with us.\n* The only other place for her to sleep would be the couch. I keep unorthodox hours, though, and am usually up working til about 3 a.m. So, her friend would have to sleep on the couch in the living room while I'm awake nearby. Allegedly, her friend falls asleep quick and is a deep sleeper. Regardless, it's a big accommodation to make because it means I can't do anything other than use my computer for that time.\n* Her friend can stay at my parent's house for free, because they have tons of extra room. They live about 45 minutes from us (we live in the city center). It's far. But we could lend her the car, and her friend could just drive into the city each day. In my view, driving 90 minutes a day is certainly worth it to get free housing for a week.\n* My girlfriend wouldn't be ok with me bringing a friend to stay with us for that long. When I made that point, she mentioned that her friend \"doesn't have a lot of money,\" and theoretically she would feel better about one of my friends staying with us if they couldn't afford to stay elsewhere. This seems pretty selective, because she's making an exception for her friend.\n* Her friend doesn't like me. It's one of those things where her friend doesn't think my girlfriend should be with me. I don't care that much about her judgements, but I'm even less open to her staying with us for that long when I know she dislikes me.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685256889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ttobt/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_girlfriends_best/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s really nice that your parents are offering her to stay with them.", "NTA Your appartement clearly isn\u2019t suitable for guests and you even offered an alternative.", "NTA -  Valid points and if thats the rule for you its the rule for her friends  .", "NTA. I was trying to figure out how this might work for a couple of days until the last part. Does your girlfriend have the money to split the Airbnb with her for a girls' getaway?

Offering that she can stay at your parents house is very kind and a great compromise!", "NTA. it make\u2019s perfect sense why you don\u2019t want her to stay there. you even offered an alternative solution for the problem. i think you\u2019re being perfectly reasonable.", "NTA.

You dont have to agree, it will inconvenience you so in that regards N T A. But would i be willing to inconvenience myself for my girlfriends happiness for a week, without a doubt. If it would be at all possible for you to go home to your parents for a week that might be an option to make her happy and let her spend some time with her best friend.\nHonestly this would be something to make me rethink my relationship if my partner would be willing to inconvenience themselves for a few days for me to spend time with my best friend. But it doesnt make you an AH.", "NTA, cos you do get a vote after all. \nBut, there\u2019s an opportunity to be a bigger, more charitable man here, and that\u2019s always worth doing if you can. Maybe you sleep on the couch? Don\u2019t know if that works but it syncs with your late nights.  Take the high road if you can find it in your heart, it\u2019s just a few nights.", "YTA it's only a week. Suck it up. Maybe the friend doesn't like you because of things like this.\n\n Relationships are give and take and this seems like something your girlfriend really wants.", "Tell she can come stay with me", "ESH (a little bit). I like guests, so that colors my opinion, but I would suck it up and adjust my schedule for a week for my SO's BFF. Your girlfriend sucks for not reciprocating the invite for your friends, though I have to wonder why your friend coming wouldn't cause you the same problems. \n\nTry some breathable athletic wear for sleeping.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think your girlfriend is an asshole either.  But your boundaries are valid.", "Plus lending their car and this is to someone who doesn't like him!", "Waiting for the girlfriend to say that Op should give up the bed and he should sleep on the couch instead.", "He still has the same problems though even if he is on the sofa. They women would be confined to the bedroom until he wakes up because of the clothes and eczema. Would you really want someone you don\u2019t get on with staying with you? I wouldn\u2019t want that in a house, let alone a 1 bedroom flat.", ">Relationships are give and take \n\nBut not for the girlfriend as she wouldn't let op do the same", "But her gf is an AH because she wants her friend to stay with them and doesnt open the option to his friends.", "I think his gf is being unreasonable but it comes from an understandable place if she\u2019s really trying to help a friend in need.  \n\nI get your point about the hypocrisy.  To me it depends on how true the whole angle of this person being in need is.", "The thing is, her friend isn't in need. She was only in need of a one-night stay which OP said yes to. Wanting to extend her stay for a longer visit isn't actually a need.", "The friend shouldn't extend her trip if she can't afford it. Seems pretty straightforward.", "My Mum had a saying- \"guests, like fish, start to stink after 3 days\". I have a feeling this was the friends plan all along ....", "Nta- no you don\u2019t have the room and one night in such a small space is honestly way to much. Gf should not make decisions without you. Hopefully she didn\u2019t already agree to let friend stay.", "NTA, at all. If the genders were reversed and we were taking about a man who disparages your relationship wanting to SLEEP IN YOYR BEDROOM, this wouldn\u2019t even be a conversation. Your girlfriend is also an AH for being ok with violating your comfort and boundaries for a person who is also an AH and expects to stay with you after acting in that way towards you.", "NTA - she doesn\u2019t feel the same if the roles are reversed, she needs to know no means no. It impedes your daily operation and one day is already a compromise. Another compromise is your parents house and if she\u2019s unwilling then you don\u2019t need to discuss this any further.", "NTA.\n\nSay she can share the bedroom if you're allowed to continue to sleep naked, and if she makes any disparaging comments she has to make up for it with \"actions and not words\" (if you know what I mean). If your girlfriend blows up about that suggestion, say \"exactly\" and if she agrees to it, you have either *much* bigger problems, or an \"opportunity\", depending on your sexual/moral compass.\n\nAs far as sleeping on the couch; you can just say \"when you work, she works,\" and that's how she can avoid being a freeloader.\n\nBasically, make the trade-off for staying unacceptable, and that way they are the ones choosing not to have her stay.", "NTA. You agreed to one night when that was the ask. Now it seems like that ask was a \"shoe in the door\" for a much greater ask. \n\nIf I put myself in the perspective of a person who wants to stay in another town for a week, there's no way I'd ask a couple with pets in a 1BR to put me up for that time. If I can't afford the airbnb, I'd borrow that money. If nobody will lend it to me, my trip just has to be the short one I originally planned. Nowhere in there am I expecting someone to inconvenience themselves for my sake.", "NTA because you\u2019ve gone out of your way to be accomodating and offered her the car and your parents place. Maybe you could compromise and she stays over weekend though so your gf and she get good quality time.", "NAH you\u2019re allowed to not want people staying. Your partner is allowed to want to have a friend visit. \n\nYour solution isn\u2019t a solution - hey you can stay an hour away with strangers and just - come visit us during the day.  Your reasons really boil down to - I don\u2019t want your friends here, which is valid. \n\nIt\u2019sa pity they won\u2019t be able to catch up more - but that\u2019s the downside of having a small place you can\u2019t easily have friends over.", "If not an airbnb, then share a room at a backpackers hostel. They are usually cheap as chips and often in most city centres.", "The alternative isn't \"perfectly reasonable\". It's...weird. She wants to visit with her friend, not her friend's boyfriend's parents. These people are basically strangers to her. She would probably be uncomfortable staying in their home, from a social perspective, even if the accommodations are more comfortable physically. It's sorta generous (but not nearly as generous as OP going to stay with his parents or even sleep in the living room). I wouldn't take him up on this offer either. \n\nThat said, OP obviously isn't obligated to let her stay, for all of the reasons that he listed. But let's not pretend that this offer was a great solution.", "Is it more charitable when an alternative of an actual bedroom is being offered? I wouldn\u2019t sleep on the sofa for a week for a guest who has actively voiced not liking me.\n\nIt sounds like a recipe for disaster, especially if disturbed sleep over the course of a week is added to the mix.", "Relationships are give and take, but they\u2019re also about respecting your significant other\u2019s feelings. This doesn\u2019t sound like a good situation for anyone involved, from the guest whose sleep will ultimately be disturbed to the man walking on eggshells with someone in his home who has voiced not liking him.", "It's not a great solution, but it's a solution.\n\nIf I were OP, I'd refuse to be kicked out of my house to make room for someone who tells my partner they shouldn't be with me to spend a week with my partner either.", "It was perfectly reasonable to suit her accommodation budget, which appears to be zero.", "Or he can sleep at his parents...", "I don't think he should! A good solution might be the girlfriend splitting a hotel with her friend and making a staycation out of it. OP shouldn't be the one having to go out of his way to make this work. \n\nI just find it extremely odd that the comments are fawning over this bizarre alternative that no reasonable person would ever accept.", "Why? OP has gone out of their way to be very accommodating and make it almost free for someone who's struggling with money.\n\nIt's bizarre that the friend and GF are basically being as difficult as possible when they're being handed a great solution."]}
