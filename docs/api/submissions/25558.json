{"id": 25558, "submission_id": "161xo27", "title": "AITA for accidentally roping my co-worker into doing an interpretive dance at our work conference", "selftext": "I (28F) have worked with Kim (30F) for about three years. We\u2019re managers at the same level, and we manage different (but related) teams. For the last year and a half she has been taking modern dance classes, and talks about it a lot at work (this will be important later). \n\nKim and I get along well most of the time. One thing that bugs me is that she volunteers me for things without running it by me first. For example, I\u2019ll tell her I\u2019m taking a weekend seminar on something, and then she\u2019ll tell people that I will be doing a talk on this new thing I learned. I like sharing knowledge, but I don\u2019t always have the time and energy for the extra work; I have told her this several times. She always says that she is trying to help me have a higher profile in the company. \n\nWe are having a big conference/team building thing at the end of September that Kim and I, our bosses and about 150 employees will be attending. It\u2019s a multi-day event with training and roundtables, as well as some social events; Kim and I played a big part in the planning. Sure enough, Kim sent an email early last week to me, our directors, and a few other people saying that I had some really good insights on self-care strategies (we\u2019d been talking about it casually the previous week) and luckily there would be time for me to give a brief presentation on them during lunch on the 27th. This was not discussed with me.\n\nHere's where I might be the AH. I replied-all to the email, saying, \u201cFor sure! And I\u2019m so looking forward to the original interpretive dance inspired by our 2024 diversity strategy that Kim is going to perform during the conference closing festivities!\u201d I thought this was an obvious sarcastic comment, but apparently not. Kim texted me immediately asking WTF I was talking about, and I wrote back, \u201cOh, should I have checked with you before signing you up for that? My bad.\u201d Unfortunately, her boss did not understand that I was joking, and replied to the email saying that he was really impressed that she was bringing such creativity to the conference, and that he looked forward to seeing it. \n\nLong story short, Kim is now freaking out because she does not have an interpretive dance based on our diversity strategy prepared, she doesn\u2019t want to do such a dance in front of 150 people, and she doesn\u2019t feel like she can back out since her boss likes the idea. I offered to own up to the fact that I was making a sarcastic joke, but she doesn\u2019t want me to. I have apologized but I have to admit that I was laughing a bit while I did it, because this is ridiculous. If the consensus is that I\u2019m the AH, I will pay for her new leotard and buy her drinks at the conference. \r  \n", "created_utc": 1693062448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161xo27/aita_for_accidentally_roping_my_coworker_into/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Weird. She\u2019s basically forcing herself to do it at this point", "I'm going to say NTA, because it's so weird that people didn't get that it was a joke. It seems reasonable that you thought it was going to be a throwaway comment, and it wasn't really foreseeable that Kim would actually end up doing an interpretive dance in front of all your co-workers (although that is very funny)", "NTA. Get wrecked Kim.", "NTA and what you did is genius lol, because going forward she will (hopefully) think twice before signing you up for anything without consulting with you first.", "The least you can do is get her loaded before she does her interpretive dance! /s NTA, but I\u2019m shocked people took that seriously. Maybe it would have been better to let everyone know in the email you sent after Kim basically forced you to do a thing that \u201cKim was really nice to volunteer my services for the third year in a row, but I really don\u2019t feel up to the task, and that she would have known that, had she bothered to check with me before making a commitment for me.\u201d or something to that extent.", "This sounds like petty revenge to me. Instead of correcting the email stating that you were NOT going to do the thing she said you were going to do, you \u201cvolunteered\u201d her to do something as well.

I own the fact that I was being a bit of a sarcastic dick.", "I can't quite picture what it's going to be like, but I saw her sketching out some ideas yesterday - there were rainbow streamers involved.", "Ya, I don't really get that either. She said that she doesn't want her boss to know that she's involved in \"childish games,\" but this is clearly all on me, so I don't understand how fessing up to it would make her look bad.", "I can definitely see how it would come across that way, but it's not that serious. Kim isn't my boss and it's not like I'm forced to do the things she signs me up for. It's more of a minor irritation that I have to send around an email backing out of stuff that I never agreed to in the first place. I wouldn't involve HR in something like this. ESH here is fair, since I probably should have just continued to deal with her directly instead of making a joke. I never in a million years thought anyone would take it seriously, though.", "I actually suggested that she fake an injury when she shut down some other ideas to get out of this.

Not everyone listens to reason.

I also think this is an excellent opportunity to have a sit down eye to eye and pinky swear not to volunteer each other for things anymore without advance discussion.", "Europe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd there certainly can be made a case of it.", "I'm not an expert on European law, but if that's the case I find that absolutely wild. I'm an employment lawyer in Canada and we have pretty strict anti-harassment and human rights laws - this wouldn't come close to an incident justifying termination.", "Probably not termination - but certainly a reprimand,.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepends on the details.", "I'd be shocked if something like this resulted in any kind of discipline. OP made a joke and offered to own up to it but Kim said no.", "NTA. That should help her have a higher profile in the company.", "NTA\nWhy did you apologise?! You should have said,  well Kim,  you keep volunteering me for things so I'm just repaying the favour!

I hope someone records it.\n\nCore memory!", "She\u2019s trying to torpedo your career.\n\nShe wants upper management to see her as more of an executive and you as more of an \u201coutgoing\u201d manager, fit for your role.\n\nAll of that time and energy you\u2019ve been putting into her volunteered assignments isn\u2019t going into your job.\n\nShe\u2019s the asshole.

Kim was/is trying to sabotage you either by making you work on an extra project you never volunteered for or making you look like a bad team player if you ever refuse to present.

Apparently not, the journalist wrote a story for the local paper using \"resident pigeon expert\" as my colleagues official title. \n\nLocal people weren't happy that the local authority were wasting tax payers money on employing a \"resident pigeon expert\" and expressed this in many, many phone calls, emails and letters. I'm lucky, my boss thought it was hilarious, the colleague not so mych, It was over 20 years ago, still makes me laugh.\n\nMoral of the story is never to assume that people can detect sarcasm!", "Oh, that sounds awesome.  You need to either set up an honest, fantastic introduction for her, possibly including that you were sort of kidding, but her being such an exceptional employee that she stepped up to the challenge. Wait for her in the wings with that drink.  Agree with ThisisTheCaptain that I would have quit my job if I got that challenge.", "Feign an injury, done", "I assumed you would be TA based on the title but how else will she learn \u201cbeing volunteered for something without knowledge/permission is annoying af\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You have Kim a taste of her own medicine. She shouldn\u2019t volunteer you for things anymore.", "Think of it as the penis of karma releasing the seminal fluid of retribution...", "Fessing up would require you explain why, and that would make her look bad.  And rightly so.  You are good here!  \n\nBut make sure to speak up next time she volunteers you and say to the higher ups that you and she ever discussed that and you cannot add her proposed extra commitment to your plate.

You may be an AH in this but with good reason. It's a great solution to your problem.

Maybe justified AH but I\u2019m going with NTA because you simply did to her what she\u2019s repetitively done to you even after being asked not to.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t learn her lesson from this and continues to volunteer you in the future, just \u201creply all\u201d with \u201cno, I won\u2019t be doing that. Kim, please don\u2019t volunteer me for things without asking me first.\u201d Publicly calling her out might be the only way to get her attention.\n\nStanding O for the dance all the way though!", "This is a better plot line for a movie then anything Netflix has spat out in 3 years", "Just a thought...  Maybe her boss *didn't* misunderstand you...  Maybe he is also a victim of her tendency to voluntold (?grammar?) people for things and is taking it seriously in the hopes that it will teach her the same lesson...\n\nSide note:  I laughed so hard, I scared the cat.", "Did she learn to not poke the bear though?", "Omg yes", "Buy her the drinks before she \u201cdances.\u201d", "God, I hate interpretative dance!", "NTA. Clever comeback and she has the ability to back out. She is just choosing to not make waves since she may have to come clean to leadership about she has treated you.", "NTA\n\nJust tell her that you're trying to help her have a higher profile in the company.", "This is super funny!", "This is a possibility. I cannot imagine being a manager, reading this, and taking it seriously. On the other hand, I've met an unfortunate number of managers who lack common sense.
