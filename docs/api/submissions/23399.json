Hell no, don\u2019t do it & do not send any more gifts. She disrespected you and will continue to do so in the future.

Tell your parents to back off or you will stop having a good relationship with them and not talk to them in the future.

She acted shitty to you, why would you go visit her?", "Visiting her could lead her to believe there is a chance for your relationship, and your reasons for being there go beyond friendship. By not going you are realistically setting her expectations, while sending the panda let's her know you wish her well and she's in your thoughts while she is in hospital. Perfect solution. You are doing her a kindness by not leading her on. You are also an adult who gets to make his own choices your mum should respect that choice.

You are / were in a mess.  not giving her a mother chance is protecting you.  You don't want to return to that dark place.  you don't want to be hurt again.\n\nIf in the future, you can stomach seeing her, you probably should.  I think you deserve an apology for her for her behavior.  I think seeing her may give you some sense of closure.\n\nNTA"]}
