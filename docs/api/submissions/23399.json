They are willing to put you in an uncomfortable situation and chose their friendship over their own son.

Hell no, don\u2019t do it & do not send any more gifts. She disrespected you and will continue to do so in the future. You do not need her or want her in your future life and you do not any responsibility to see her or help her out and be there for her in this situation or any other! Tell your parents to back off or you will stop having a good relationship with them and not talk to them in the future. You and her are over and never getting back together and they need to see it and respect it. I guarantee mom is getting info from her friend who wants you back together. Do NOT engage!", "NTA.

She was a cheater and the relationship was over.", "NTA- it doesn\u2019t matter if she is your mums friends daughter or not. She acted shitty to you, why would you go visit her?", "Visiting her could lead her to believe there is a chance for your relationship, and your reasons for being there go beyond friendship. By not going you are realistically setting her expectations, while sending the panda let's her know you wish her well and she's in your thoughts while she is in hospital. Perfect solution. You are doing her a kindness by not leading her on. You are also an adult who gets to make his own choices your mum should respect that choice.

You are / were in a mess.  not giving her a mother chance is protecting you.  You don't want to return to that dark place.  you don't want to be hurt again.\n\nIf in the future, you can stomach seeing her, you probably should.

Sometimes you have to strip the connections away to get the meat of the problem out in the open. 'Mom, I don't like her or consider her a friend. I would just as soon visit a stranger in the hospital as her. Sending the panda is as nice as I am willing to be to her.'", "NTA, does your mom know the reason you all broke up?

However, she did feel remorse and apologize and since she is wealthy she doesn't have to use you for anything so it is most likely sincere.  Maybe she had to learn that a best friend makes te better lover and it helped her to realize it.  If you would like to be forgiven for your wrongs bc no one is perfect.  You should forgive her and visit.  This could also get her to reveal feelings later for a stronger bond in te future bc you taught her loyalty, love, and mercy leading by example.  Remember this friend.", "For what reason? So she can cry crocodile tears and try to apologize and win him back some more? He sent a thinking of you gift which is more than she was entitled to.

That shows a basic disregard of OP as a human being. \n\nThis is not a minor mistake.\n\nThe first thing you need to restore a relationship is acknowledge the extent of the betrayal. Chocolates don\u2019t do that (it\u2019s a bribe). The next thing you need to do is change behaviors. After that you need **time** to show the change is real. And you need **time** to restore trust.\n\nOP sent a stuffed animal with well wishes for healing. That is in itself an act of grace.", "NTA. I just love how some parents will tell you time and time again to \"be an individual\", \"stand your ground\", all that other crap, yet when you're old enough to have a legitimate reason for not wanting to do something they *immediately* resort to calling you childish and petty. I mean damn, you at least sent a stuffed animal, just because you dont want to see her doesnt mean you wish her harm.

Like how can felons get a chance if no one hires them.  My point is it makes him no better to get revenge by being cold when it's a life threatening situation.  2 wrongs don't make a right and you can't teach someone to change if you don't soften your heart.  Instead you harden their heart and they could get worse in te future hurting more ppl continuing te chain.", "No one has to agree.  It's his decision.  I'm just trying to provide another perspective.  Didn't spiderman teach you with great power comes great responsibility and now he is in te upper position.  So why abuse it like she did.  She will learn to keep abusing her upper hand with a new scar that no one cares even when it comes to tragedy so why should she.", "\ud83e\udd23 Your response suits your username!
