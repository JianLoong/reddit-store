I received some really great advice and some amazingly kind messages, so thank you again! I am getting a lot of update requests, so here it is.\n\nTo get this out of the way for everyone who wants a quick update, Ashley did end up coming on the ski trip. We had a great time, me especially as my engagement ring arrived and me and my bf are now officially engaged.\n\nA lot of people suggested we all sit down to discuss what's been going on, and we did. Ashley managed to say a lot of what she'd been saying to me to Amy. The conversation boiled down to, Ashley doesn't want an absent mother, but she wants a mother, not a friend. She wants a mum who drives her to ice skating with her friends, and sits in the stands to supervise, not one who comes onto the ice with them and tries to hang out. She says she does sometimes feel awkward at school, but she manages it most of the time, until her mum is around and then she is reminded that she's different. A lot more was said, but this was the main gist.\n\nAs for Amy, it turns out she has a lot of resentment towards our family, and even towards Ashley. She feels it's not fair that me and my parents focused so much on supporting Ashley rather than supporting Amy. She said instead of funding Ashley's education, my parents should have offered to pay for her to attend university after Ashley was born, or they should have done this instead of clearing Hugo's student loan debt. She said us caring about Ashley should have made us like her more but we all ignored her in favour of her baby, and now even her kid was abandoning her. I won't comment on this other than to say we were all shocked by what she said. \n\nThe outcome of the conversation was that Hugo and Amy decided never to tell Ashley that they almost didn't let her go on the ski trip. Ashley will start seeing a therapist to talk about what's been going on with her at home and at school, and bring her mother into some sessions if necessary. My parents have offered to fund it if it's not feasible for her parents to pay, but they're looking into it. \n\nAshley said Amy has been giving her a lot more space since she got home, and Hugo has been spending more time with her, and might start taking riding lessons with her (he played polo as a teen) for them to bond more doing something Ashley loves. Overall she seems a lot happier. Unfortunately, the things Amy said about our family have caused some issues between her and Hugo. Everyone is hoping they can work through it.\n\nSo, sort of an open ended update, but I'm really glad Ashley finally got to have the conversation she needed, and that she seems to be doing so well, because really that is all I've ever been hoping for. \n\nThank you again to everyone who took the time to comment!", "created_utc": 1673173207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106fwz5/update_my_brother_and_sil_asked_me_to_lie_to_my/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Thank you very much for the update. I am glad you could talk it out. \nEven though you don't want to go into detail about how Amy felt after Ashley was born, I think it is important. Amy's own life was on pause having a child so early, she doesn't have a career to go back to after Ashley grew up.\nI feel like she should have asked for support but I can see where she comes from.", "I am happy to read that Ashley got to have a real conversation and can focus on the future with help.\n\nI must say, that I am not surprised Amy feels this way. She was still a teenager after all, when she became a mom. And just because somebody is an adult according to the law. It doesn't make them an adult emotionally (nor brain wise, it is still developing at that age after all). Amy will need help as well, and I do mean therapy. I hope when Hugo and Amy figure that out, you all will be willing to help as well. Ashley deserves a healthy mother, with whom she can have a real healthy relationship with.", "Amy also needs to go to therapy. Because wow. The sense of entitlement here is overpowering wow. To expect your family to fund HER education and being jealous of her own daughter is verrrrryyyy, for the lack of a better word, disturbing. Yikes.", "That sounds like real progress.", "Wow Amy just sounds like the worst. \"I got knocked up young so your family should have paid for me to go to uni\"?", "Amy sounds unhinged why should your parents have payed for her education rather than there granchilds, it's clear she's jealous of her daughter which is disturbing and I think she should be the one therapy not the poor kid. To tell her daughter that she has resentment against her own daughter wow just wow", "Thanks for the update!", "YTA, (didn\u2019t read the post was too long)", "Amy bat shit crazy if she thinks the grandparents should fund her education instead of their grandchild.", "Amy is a bit of nut... she wanted her in laws to pay for her college?? In what world does she live", "I'm sorry but alot of woman have children young(me) I work may not be what I wanted to do but I do it cause it was my choice to have a child and I didn't expect anyone else to provide for me or my son for anything especially an education. She could of easily of got off her butt and get a job and go back to school 1000's of ppl do it every day. She shouldn't of told her daughter the things she did it's disgusting and she's sounds very entitled to expect everyone to be there for her and not her daughter", "Really sad if you think about it. Amy clearly was only an adult by law. She was not emotionally an adult and one could question if she was ready to be a mom. It is clear she never worked through those emotions and they turned into some very dark and ugly resentment. She needs help. And for Ashley's sake, I hope they all figure that out. Ashley does deserve a healthy relationship with her own mom after all.", "Seriously.  And if you did you\u2019d realize how fucking pompous and first world the OP is.  Ohhh Hugo played polo as a teen\u2026shut the fuck up"]}
