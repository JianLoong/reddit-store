I received some really great advice and some amazingly kind messages, so thank you again! I am getting a lot of update requests, so here it is.\n\nTo get this out of the way for everyone who wants a quick update, Ashley did end up coming on the ski trip. We had a great time, me especially as my engagement ring arrived and me and my bf are now officially engaged.\n\nA lot of people suggested we all sit down to discuss what's been going on, and we did. Ashley managed to say a lot of what she'd been saying to me to Amy. The conversation boiled down to, Ashley doesn't want an absent mother, but she wants a mother, not a friend. She wants a mum who drives her to ice skating with her friends, and sits in the stands to supervise, not one who comes onto the ice with them and tries to hang out. She says she does sometimes feel awkward at school, but she manages it most of the time, until her mum is around and then she is reminded that she's different. A lot more was said, but this was the main gist.\n\nAs for Amy, it turns out she has a lot of resentment towards our family, and even towards Ashley. She feels it's not fair that me and my parents focused so much on supporting Ashley rather than supporting Amy. She said instead of funding Ashley's education, my parents should have offered to pay for her to attend university after Ashley was born, or they should have done this instead of clearing Hugo's student loan debt. She said us caring about Ashley should have made us like her more but we all ignored her in favour of her baby, and now even her kid was abandoning her. I won't comment on this other than to say we were all shocked by what she said. \n\nThe outcome of the conversation was that Hugo and Amy decided never to tell Ashley that they almost didn't let her go on the ski trip. Ashley will start seeing a therapist to talk about what's been going on with her at home and at school, and bring her mother into some sessions if necessary. My parents have offered to fund it if it's not feasible for her parents to pay, but they're looking into it. \n\nAshley said Amy has been giving her a lot more space since she got home, and Hugo has been spending more time with her, and might start taking riding lessons with her (he played polo as a teen) for them to bond more doing something Ashley loves. Overall she seems a lot happier. Unfortunately, the things Amy said about our family have caused some issues between her and Hugo. Everyone is hoping they can work through it.\n\nSo, sort of an open ended update, but I'm really glad Ashley finally got to have the conversation she needed, and that she seems to be doing so well, because really that is all I've ever been hoping for. \n\nThank you again to everyone who took the time to comment!", "created_utc": 1673173207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106fwz5/update_my_brother_and_sil_asked_me_to_lie_to_my/", "score": 782, "replies": ["Thank you very much for the update. I am glad you could talk it out. \nEven though you don't want to go into detail about how Amy felt after Ashley was born, I think it is important. Amy's own life was on pause having a child so early, she doesn't have a career to go back to after Ashley grew up.\nI feel like she should have asked for support but I can see where she comes from.", "I am happy to read that Ashley got to have a real conversation and can focus on the future with help.\n\nI must say, that I am not surprised Amy feels this way. She was still a teenager after all, when she became a mom. And just because somebody is an adult according to the law. It doesn't make them an adult emotionally (nor brain wise, it is still developing at that age after all). Amy will need help as well, and I do mean therapy. I hope when Hugo and Amy figure that out, you all will be willing to help as well. Ashley deserves a healthy mother, with whom she can have a real healthy relationship with.", "Amy also needs to go to therapy. Because wow. The sense of entitlement here is overpowering wow. To expect your family to fund HER education and being jealous of her own daughter is verrrrryyyy, for the lack of a better word, disturbing. Yikes.", "That sounds like real progress.", "Wow Amy just sounds like the worst. \"I got knocked up young so your family should have paid for me to go to uni\"?", "Amy sounds unhinged why should your parents have payed for her education rather than there granchilds, it's clear she's jealous of her daughter which is disturbing and I think she should be the one therapy not the poor kid. To tell her daughter that she has resentment against her own daughter wow just wow", "Thanks for the update!", "YTA, (didn\u2019t read the post was too long)", "Amy bat shit crazy if she thinks the grandparents should fund her education instead of their grandchild.", "Amy is a bit of nut... she wanted her in laws to pay for her college?? In what world does she live", "I'm sorry but alot of woman have children young(me) I work may not be what I wanted to do but I do it cause it was my choice to have a child and I didn't expect anyone else to provide for me or my son for anything especially an education. She could of easily of got off her butt and get a job and go back to school 1000's of ppl do it every day. She shouldn't of told her daughter the things she did it's disgusting and she's sounds very entitled to expect everyone to be there for her and not her daughter", "Really sad if you think about it. Amy clearly was only an adult by law. She was not emotionally an adult and one could question if she was ready to be a mom. It is clear she never worked through those emotions and they turned into some very dark and ugly resentment. She needs help. And for Ashley's sake, I hope they all figure that out. Ashley does deserve a healthy relationship with her own mom after all.", "[removed]", "I think Amy needs a therapist more than Ashley does. She's upset at the wrong people over her situation.", "I really feel sorry for Amy. She is in a no-one win situation. Even here, so much hate toward Amy. Guess there's a lot of people walking on water here. Why didn't anyone in family offer to help Amy?", "Marrying into a rich family does not entitle you to those peoples money.  And before somebody hit me with the \u201cthey should want to give her that money\u201c response.  She has a whole husband, if she wants to go to school, then her and her husband should get together and figure out how to make that happen.  It\u2019s possible that if Hugo and Amy were making efforts in that direction the in-laws might see it and decide to help out but if they don\u2019t it still doesn\u2019t make them bad people.  I\u2018m more interested in Amy and Ashley improving their relationship.", "Congratulations on your engagement. And thanks for updating.", "Keep up the good work. At this rate Amy should be out of the picture in no time then you can swoop in steal her kid like you clearly want to.", "Lots to un pick here but a stand out to me is that Amy got pregnant by the son of a rich family and imagined that made her rich too. She expected to be living the lifestyle her daughter actually is and resents everyone for that not being the case. Chuck in some emotional immaturity and boredom and you have this. NTA still though your brother has some work to do.", "Congratulations on the engagement and thanks for the update!!\n\nI worry about Amy not getting therapy in this. I understand her comments about the family are... less than savory but I hope Hugo recognizes some key things that need to happen in his house for it not to burn down. \n\nShe needs something to actually fulfill her as a person. A career would probably do wonders for her because it sounds like she feels real isolated. \n\nSuper glad Ashley was able to clear some things up and communicate with her parents about boundaries.", "ESH\n\nLook at it from Amy's POV: rich kid Hugo (polo-playing!) knocked her up, derailed her education/job/life plans, got cut off by his AH parents (bc he didn't ditch not-so-rich Amy?), so she ended up isolated and short of money while he got his education keeping his future job opps open.\n\nHere she is 11 years later, Hugo's doing ok and reconciled with his parents, her daughter is at a swanky school paid for by said grandparents, but she (Amy) doesn't have the clothes/money/job/education to fit in with the other mothers. \n\nDo OP/Hugo's parents treat her like a gold-digger that 'trapped' their precious son? OP's developed a great relationship with Ashley but doesn't get on particularly well with Amy. I'm not saying she's perfect but she seems to me to be a lonely fish-out-of-water SAHM that no-one seems to have any sympathy for and nobody really tries to include. Her daughter is embarrassed by her, her husband doesn't seem to really see any problems, and the only one giving her love is the 4-yr-old.\n\nIf there's spare cash, I would hope Amy has a good hard think about getting some training/education, then a part-time job, till her son's old enough for her to go to full-time. Then if this - at best oblivious, at worst alienating - family dumps Amy out in the cold, she has some skills to start again.", "I feel for Amy. She had a baby as a teen (her age is never mentioned, which I find off), seems she got cut out of her own family as well as her partners' during a difficult time in her life, and threw herself into trying to be a great mum. Now Ashley is growing up and being, honestly, a cruel and self centred brat. OP's family obviously is financially able to help out with education, because they pay for their granddaughter, and they paid off their son's loans (after I assume they reconciled). But Amy's just left on her own? What support did she get as a teen mother? Sounds like she didn't get a chance for education or life experiences. She made a lot of sacrifices to have Ashley, and is just generally being dismissed/unvalued. \n\nI think Amy feels she got trapped by circumstances and doesn't even have the reward of being valued by her own daughter. I don't think it's entitled or unhinged of her to be resentful of her current situation. I think she could definitely benefit from therapy to process the emotions she's probably been repressing all these years.\n\nMight help if the family generally treated her like family. Because from OP's post, I get the sense that they probably don't do that.", "Thank you for the update.   I was wondering how it turned out.   Wow.  That is a lot to unpack.  There is a lot of built-up resentment and entitlement there, though.   If she wanted to go back to school, why didn't she go when your niece was younger?  Why did she expect your parents to fund HER education?   Did she ask for help or just expect it and then sit there getting mad because they didn't jump in to like she wanted them to?  I'm glad you guys sat down and talked about it, but wow.   Hopefully, everyone keeps working on it all.   And congrats on your engagement!", "It's kinda sad that Amy spills her guts about how she feels less than compared to Ashley and that side of the family *and* she identifies the parents funding things for Ashley as a source of hurt and then the response is for the parents to fund therapy only for Ashley when Amy is clearly in desperate need of therapy too. \n\nI get that Amy isn't their blood and she isn't entitled to their money for uni or anything else, but man that has to sting.", "If there's spare cash, I would hope Amy has a good hard think about getting some training/education, then a part-time job", "Why she is grown up.\n\nShe chose to have a child and do nothing for herself.\n\nIf she wants her life to change she needs to change it her self.\n\nWhat has been doing for the last 11 years.\n\nI get that the first fee years she was looking after Ashley but when Ashley started School, why didn't Amy start doing something for herself during those hours Ashley was at school.   \n\nIf she really wanted go back to school then she should talked to her husband and made a plan with him.    \n\nLots of women are raising and getting an education and working.", "Well maybe Hugo and Amy should be paying for Ashley's education instead of the in laws. Perhaps what they are doing with their money contributes to how Amy feels.", "Thank you :)", "Nobody treats Amy like she trapped Hugo, no one even thinks that happened. Hugo is a grown man, he wasn't trapped into making his own decisions. He was cut off by our parents because they didn't think they should be subsidising the life of a husband and father, they cut me off eventually too. \n\nAmy is not their child/grandchild, I'm not sure why she would expect them to pay for her education. Hugo is not entitled to have his further education paid for, that was a generous gift.", "She was 18 when she got pregnant, 19 when she had Ashley. What is off about that?", ">why should your parents have payed for her education rather than there granchilds\n\nWhy should they have paid for their child's education? Is that a serious question you're asking as if it's not something parents do for their children every day?", "People who downvoted... did your in laws paid for your education?", "And her husband.. why would she rather them pay for her school than his debts? If those debts they would have had to pay are cleared, they logically can take out more loans for her to go to school now.", "I did not mean to defend her but I can understand why she may feel like everybody's life goes on and she is left out. Her child grows up, her family has a job and she is in the same place she was before getting pregnant. It is not up to the family or anyone else to do something against it but maybe they can understand how she feels and offer her support if they wish.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like they can afford to pay for it.  But they are her parents and they are well within their rights to refuse the money.", "Where are Amy's Parents in all this ?\n\nDoes she have any family ?\n\nDoes Amy have a Job ?\n\nWhat is Amy's life like exactly ?", ">*Nobody treats Amy like she trapped Hugo, no one even thinks that happened*\n\nGood, glad to hear it. \n\n*not sure why she would expect them to pay for her education*\n\nDidn't say that; I meant, if there's now any spare money in Hugo/Amy household budget, she should go get training/education. She'd end up less isolated, with some outside friends/contacts, plus skills to take forward.", "It was a piece of missing information that seemed suspicious. Also good job disregarding 99% of my comment.", "I think you have them mixed up.  Amy is the daughter in law, not their daughter.  Ashley is their grand child.", "She still has her 4yo little boy to handle yet so I really do hope she gets help before she does the exact same thing to him. I think maybe trying to get a part time job while the kids are at school could help but I think now she's been home that long I don't think she would want to work. I think she may of gotten use it cause if she really wanted a job or a career she could of when Ashley was younger and then done some online classes. I think she's a very entitled person towards op family, like she thinks they owe her cause she gave them Ashley at a young age.", "Amy has an on/off relationship with her mum, sometimes they're close, then they fight and don't talk for months. I think she's only seen her dad sporadically throughout her life.\n\nAmy doesn't work, no. I think she had a short lived part time job right before she got pregnant with my nephew.\n\nOn a day to day basis, I don't know what her life is like. I live abroad, and I see her every couple of months when at my parents' or when I'm picking Ashley up/dropping her off. I imagine being a SAHM to two kids is exhausting, she dedicates herself to her family, but I don't know what her timetable is or anything like that.", "I just answered the question that I could. I don't know what support Amy received, I was 17 when she got pregnant. I also don't know what kind of relationship she had with her own mother at that time, so I really don't know if her mother was there for her physically or emotionally. I know when Ashley was young Amy didn't socialise much because she lost a lot of friends after dropping out, but that's really all I know about that time.", "Thank you for this information.", "You're literally only one year younger than her. Is that meant to be an explanation for why you've seemingly got zero relationship or interest in your sister in law? You don't know if she had support? You don't know if she talks to her mum? You don't know if your parents helped her out? Couldn't send her a friend request on FB and ask how she's doing? It's been eleven years. Never had a conversation with the woman?", "I know she has a on/off relationship with her mum now, so I don't know if they were on/off then. My parents bought a lot of baby stuff (cot, toys, pram, etc) for them. Hugo and Amy brought Ashley over every weekend when she was a baby and my parents babysat her when Hugo was going through exam periods at university while she was very young. \n\nI've obviously had conversations with Amy, but not long or deep ones because Amy doesn't like me, hasn't since we were teenagers. She does things like call me a hooker at dinner parties. She's Ashley's mother, so I don't fight with her and I don't ever say anything bad about her, but she quite clearly does not want to be my friend. Which is her prerogative.", "I\u2019m shocked by the comment section. While you can disagree with what Amy wants she was just sharing how she feels. She was a child when she got pregnant and now 11 years later, her kid is on the brink of becoming a teenager and being more independent and she\u2019s not in a good place because she went from a child to a mum and doesn\u2019t know who she is.", ">my parents should have offered to pay for her to attend university after Ashley was born, or they should have done this instead of clearing Hugo's student loan debt.\n\nI'm sorry; she thinks her in laws should have paid for her to go to university over paying for THEIR OWN SON'S student debt?\n\nShe's the one that needs to go to therapy.", "Wow. \n\nSo they are sending Ashly to therapy\u2026. I mean that\u2019s great that she get a place to went with a professional.\n\nBut damn I mean Ashly is Not then one most in need of a therapist in these two posts. \n\nAmy takes that prize by not just a mile but a whole marathon", "Amy seems to have developed the habit of blaming other people for her choices.", "I feel really sorry for Amy, she is surrounded by privileged people living privileged lives whilst she is left out on the side. \n\nHer daughter has been included in this privilege but she has not, which is one of the reasons her own daughter looks down on her as she sees that her mother is treated differently from the rest of them, I guess she was nothing more than the incubator and free child care.", "Amy needs therapy. I hope she gets it.", "I feel bad for Amy. Her child got sucked in by the lure of money, and it seems she'll never get her back.", "The entitlement", "So Amy and Hugo got cut off until your parents decided they wanted to be around the grandbaby? Was Amy just a walking womb? I feel for her.", "So, Amy's version of the problem is \"you should have funded my life instead of my child's\". Wow, that's some major entitlement. She needs more therapy than Ashley.", "Honestly this update makes me feel really sad for Amy. She ended up pregnant way to young and it sounds like she never got to go to post secondary, build her own career or develop her own identity. Her whole identity has been being a mom but now her daughter is pulling away from her. It sounds like Amy has always been an outsider to your family, and has probably been mostly ignored or treated badly, while you openly accepted her daughter and by the sounds of it spoiled her. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I feel sorry for Ashley too, because I relate to her. I was that teenager who was embarrassed by my parents and pulled away and never felt like I fit in with my peers. Honestly, they both need therapy to help resolve these issues. And OP, I think it would be nice if you tried to get to know Amy more and try to develop more of a relationship with her. Honestly, her life seems horrible and you and your family seem like a contributing factor.", "Thanks for the update. Amy sounds very immature and I hope she gets therapy too.", "I hope your family reflect on everything Amy said. Your parents left two teenagers to figured out How to raise their child without any support and only \"help\" when the child was already born. They should have support the mother of their grandchild and instead It looks like you ALL looked down on her and now are the \"heroes\" of their daugher's life because you pay a fancy school and fancy things and everything her parents do can't ever compare. Amy is a saint to even let you guys be so close of her daugher...", "Assuming Amy was the same age as OP's brother when she got pregnant, it's pretty clear that she never got a chance to go through early adulthood and learn how to be her own person outside of her identity as a mother and wife. That can fuck a person up. Maybe I'm being overly sympathetic, but it really just makes me sad. She got pregnant too young, and isn't emotionally mature enough to build a stable and healthy relationship with her daughter as she's growing. I agree with you, she needs to be in therapy.", "On the other hand, sometimes mom's get really left behind. For some, our families expect us to do all the caregiving and nurturing, but the love and all the financials of the family go to the husband and children. It can make a mom feel really lonely and unloved, taken for granted. I can really hear that here and it makes me sad for Amy.\n\nI really feel for Amy after reading this. Her husband needs to take what she says seriously and see how he can support his wife's personal growth. That's great that he wants to spend time with Ashley bit he needs to help Amy. It isn't the responsibility of the larger family, but it is definitely her husband's job in the relationship to ensure he supports her as much as she gives to everyone else.\n\nShe sounds really lonely. OP, this story isn't over. I hope you take some time to think about how this feels from Amy's point of view. If you have it in your heart to be a sympathetic ear to her, that might be nice.", "I think OP buried the lede on this one. Amy was 18 when she got pregnant, that's her first year of uni then she was isolated/drifted away from friends as a SAHM. It's no wonder that she has resentment issues. Is it really entitlement to want an education after being knocked up by a rich kid (polo) as a teen. On top of that her in-laws don't even seem to like her", "The lack of grace/sympathy you\u2019re extending to Amy is simply astounding. As other commenters have noted she had a child fairly young and at a pivotal developmental stage, to the detriment that she missed out on a lot of formative experiences which clearly she wishes she\u2019d had. I do agree that it\u2019s a bit much to expect to have had your in-laws fund your education, but at the same time the underlying issue shes expressing is that, to quote someone replying to you, she feels left behind. It's natural/fortunate for financially able grandparents and aunts/uncles to dote in their younger relatives but, to me the subtext here is that Ashley essentially feels like a broodmare who pushed out a kid and was then left to simply be \"Amy's mom.\" There are plenty of people for whom that would be sufficient but obviously for Ashley it's not. \n\nI'm really trying to walk the razor's edge of fairness here because I do agree at a high level with your assessment that she needs to work through this for herself rather than blaming others but I also think the tenor of your response is fairly callous and uncharitable.", "Not just entitled but so entitled it skews her thinking. She resents them paying off her husband\u2019s student loan debt when she benefits immensely from that generosity.", "Low and high ses people are always going to have a hard time in a relationship together because the culture of abundance and scarcity are so at odds. You will be so much happier on average if you have similar cultures. Wear a condom kids!", "This was my exact first thought too when reading this.", "Also, if the family paid to clear out Hugo's debt, how is that functionally different from paying for Amy's education? Similar amount of money, just one thing being paid off instead of the other. They would have been in the same financial position though. That seems more like a problem between Hugo and Amy.", "Agreed.  And to not even grasp that by clearing her husband\u2019s debt, that wd have cleared the way for her to go to school too.  And I cd never EVER imagine being jealous that my child received a benefit that would help them in life.  Honestly she needs therapy more than her daughter does.", "Yeah. Id jump at the chance to help my siblings\u2019 kids. My siblings\u2019 partners? Not so much.", "Yeah, I kind of get it but also don't. If OP's parents paid for Ashley's education and Hugo's loans, the family should have more spare money and could afford the college fees for Amy (of paying back government loans as OP stated).", "Was thinking the same thing.", "This 100%! \n\nIt\u2019s rather disgusting she feels that way. Being that they cleared Hugo\u2019s school debt, she could go back now. If she truly wanted to go to school and get a degree, she\u2019d find a way to do it on her own.", "This is true, but like her education, she can't sit there and wait for it to be given to her. She has to do the work to make it happen. If that means asking for help with payment after finding and scheduling, she will have to ask.", "I agree with you- also maybe she left forgotten as a person and only seen as a mum? It also seems like Amy felt that Ashley was treated as more part of OP\u2019s family then she was- which I can agree with. In-laws can often treat grandchildren better and forget the mothers.", ">Why didn\u2019t anyone in family offer to help Amy? \n\nNow or after Ashley was born? For the latter, did she *ask?* I would find it incredibly rude if I had a kid and my in-laws went \u201cWell, time to go back to school! We\u2019ll pay for it!\u201d \n\nAs for now\u2026that\u2019s something that needs a little more discussion than a \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you say so? We\u2019ll get right on funneling tens of thousands of dollars towards your education at the drop of a hat!\u201d \n\nAnd seriously - how greedy can you get? Your husbands student loans were paid off, removing a mountain of debt from the shoulders of her little family, and the response is \u201cthat should\u2019ve gone to me even though I never said anything to indicate that\u201d???", "She sounds like she has a difficult personality. I would personally resent having to consider someone who openly hated all of us family.", "I agree the demand is harsh but I also think Amy likely got that extreme demand from years of resentment and  been givin nothing. At 18 she had to give up her life and education, and while so did her husband, he still managed to get an education and 'rewarded' by it being payed off and reconnecting with his family while she still has a bad relationship with in-laws and her own. She likely just wants someone to acknowledge what she was able to do was hard and to be able to have some of her own expierances. Tbh, school was just an example, she just wants freedom.  Again I agree that's something her and her husband should discuss, but we can't ignore that the in-laws past bad actions which set the course of this family. Yeah Amy and Ashley's relationship should completely be the main focus,  I just think its unfair to view amy as simpley feeling \"entilted\" to the money .", "It takes 2 to get knocked up.", "This is my thinking. I honestly feel bad for Amy. Losing friends and family because of kids is hard. I hope Amy goes back to school and gets a real life soon. (Speaking as a STHM with no education because of kids and lack of support.)", ">but she doesn\u2019t have the clothes/money/education to fit in with the other mothers \n\nThis is such an incredibly selfish thing to be hung up on. \u201cMy in-laws are paying for an incredible educational opportunity for my daughter, which will inevitably open doors for her that only money can, but won\u2019t anything think about the fact that the other moms dress better than me??? Why isn\u2019t anyone helping fix that??? :(\u201c\n\nIf what you\u2019ve described is her real POV, she\u2019s incredibly greedy for thinking that getting knocked up by a rich dude means she deserves his family\u2019s money, which even *he* isn\u2019t getting right now. If they didn\u2019t treat her as a gold digger, they sure as hell should now that she essentially threw a mini-tantrum and said \u201cwhy didn\u2019t anyone, without me asking, offer to pay tens-of-thousands for me to get a degree instead of relieving us of crippling student loan debt or funding a great education for my child?? What about meeeeeee!\u201d", "I\u2019m guessing Amy feels detached from her family and not entirely a part of her husband\u2019s family.", "How is Ashley being \u201ccruel\u201d and a \u201cbrat\u201d? Not wanting your mom to hang out with your friends is perfectly normal. She isn\u2019t a brat for not wanting to be smothered, wtf?", "Why should her sacrifices be valued? It was Amy's decision to have a kid at that age - they live in the UK, abortion is accessible. You don't get to blame others for your choices. And Ashley was always supported by her grandparents and OP - which in turn made life easier for Amy. They are saving money on Ashley's education and don't have to pay loans as a family. Also she's not working and never really was according to OP.", "It takes two to tango. Maybe she thought by baby trapping someone rich she will get the easy life. Maybe it was just entitlement. We can't know unless OP says something.", "So my parents should not have bought anything for Ashley as a baby? Shouldn\u2019t have offered her a chance at a great education? I shouldn\u2019t have offered her the chance to pursue her interests? Amy wasn\u2019t born into privilege so Ashley shouldn\u2019t have opportunities? What parent doesn\u2019t want more choices for their child?", "They were cut off financially, they were always in contact with my parents. My parents still do not fund their lifestyle, just Ashley\u2019s (and my nephew\u2019s) education.", "Genuine question: if you didn\u2019t read it, why did you comment?", "It\u2019s probably triggered by the fact Ashley is getting more independent. Amy went from being a teenager to a mum and now 11 years later she doesn\u2019t know who she is, that\u2019s probably why she wants an education or job.", "I agree. Amy is not being a good mum, but I think a lot of women will recognise that feeling that suddenly you're pregnant and no one sees you as anything other than a birthing machine and a mother to a baby. Not only are your emotional and even physical needs overlooked, you're considered selfish for having needs - especially if those needs are in conflict with the baby's needs. \n\nIt sounds like she had a really difficult time and that no one was really emotionally there for her. Is she entitled to have college paid for? No of course not, but I can see why offers of potentially tens of thousands of dollars for the best part of 15 years to pay for your kid's education while your educational sacrifice isn't even noticed could be very difficult to bear.", "[removed]", "Stella Dallas vibes here", "Yeah. I feel sad for Amy. It sounds like she really made herself vulnerable, finally admitted that it's hard for her to see all these advantages go to her daughter while she (Amy) is only just barely tolerated by everyone, and now her daughter is starting to do the same thing...and everyone's response was to get the daughter therapy and horseback riding lessons.\n\nI wonder if Amy wasn't actually saying that she expected her education to be funded, but instead just pointing out that it was a possibility. It only never occurred to them because they only see her as an incubator/caregiver, and not an actual person.", "and being rich herself, OP does not get it", "Thank you. All these posts focusing on Amy's entitlement, are accepting OP's version at face value. Amy became pregnant to the son of rich parents who then cut them off. Was it because he got a girl pregnant or the wrong girl pregnant? Not clear, but what OP does make clear in her original post is that Amy's entire universe shrank down to being Ashley's mom at 18 and has stayed that small. Amy's communication sounds immature. Her life and development basically ended at 18, so that's pretty unsurprising. She focuses on money as the source of inclusion and love - because that's what OP's entire family, including OP, does. OP's parents cut Amy and Hugo off, then gradually began bringing everyone back into the fold via money (Hugo's student debt, Ashley's tuition), except Amy. OP loves Ashley and lavishes her with expensive gifts and trips that Ashley's own mother can't afford. Ashley attends a school where both she and Amy are an outsider to the rest of the wealthy families, and now Ashley's mocking Amy's clothes, which don't include a regular rotation of Birkins and other high end items. \n\nAmy's attachment to Ashley is unhealthy. Her emotional development sounds stunted, and she focuses on money because that's what everyone around her does. But Ashley is Amy's only lifeline to the rest of the world and has been since she was 18, and this family has systematically weaponized their wealth to cut that line off. Amy needs therapy and a way to find herself and a supportive community separate from her child and her in-laws .", "It still takes two to tango. Maybe it's her baby trapping him. We don't know. But she absolutely needs therapy.", "It's a sad situation in general, same way I feel about most teen/student mothers, so I get where the initial feeling of missing out comes from. I do think it is entitled to then hold that resentment against the family though. Of course grandparents focused on the baby---thats what grandparents DO. It's normal to wish that they would have given you some money/opportunities, but it also doesn't sound like she brought it up at all. So just expecting to be given money and feeling resentful for YEARS when you didn't get it is pretty entitled at worst, poor communication at best.", "And we don't know that she wasn't grateful for the help provided at first. She honestly could have been grateful for it but as time passed and she kept feeling slighted or ignored or looked over, it turned into resentment. A death of a thousand cuts.

However, acting this way specifically because they didn't pay for her tuition fees is ridiculous.\n\nContext for anyone not familiar with the UK student loans system: The vast majority of students take out student loans from the government. They arent like normal loans - they have no effect on credit rating and are written off after 30 years from graduation with no consequences. You don't repay if you're earning under ~\u00a325000 a year, and even then it's pro-rated at 9% of income over this threshold - if she earned \u00a31 over the threshold, she would pay back \u00a30.09 a year. Most students never repay in full.\n\nIf she went to uni 11-12 years ago, her tuition fees would have been \u00a33000 a year for a 3 year full-time course, or the equivalent for a part-time course depending on credits - so with this resentment being about the tuition fees according to Amy, she's ruining her family relationships over \u00a39000 she feels entitled to, for a loan that she likely would never have paid back anyway.", "Op maybe for Ashley and Hugo's  sake talk to your parents  to fund  therapy  for Amy too.

So I don\u2019t really see her point.  \n\nThat just massively sounds like entitlement to your families wealth to me.  Like there was no reason for her to expect money from your parents as 99% of the population here don\u2019t ever use private wealth to go to university.

I'm not trying to save her life from her life by spending time with her when I can, and I take her to do things we both enjoy and that I would probably do anyway, and when I'm at home, we text almost ever day.

Whether she is justified in feeling hurt or not, her feelings are valid.  Her isolation as a young mom is another part of the history. I think she can be grateful for what your parents have done for Ashley and still feel like your family left her isolated.  The fact that everyone sees it as normal that she would drop out of uni and Hugo would continue seems sexist to me. Maybe she could have taken loans and remained, but everyone seems to take it for granted that she was in charge of Ashley, Hugo wasn't.  Were your parents offering to  do child care or pay for it so she could stay in school?   It may seem entitled to others, but you have to be a t least a little sympathetic to her point of view.
