I received some really great advice and some amazingly kind messages, so thank you again! I am getting a lot of update requests, so here it is.\n\nTo get this out of the way for everyone who wants a quick update, Ashley did end up coming on the ski trip. We had a great time, me especially as my engagement ring arrived and me and my bf are now officially engaged.\n\nA lot of people suggested we all sit down to discuss what's been going on, and we did. Ashley managed to say a lot of what she'd been saying to me to Amy. The conversation boiled down to, Ashley doesn't want an absent mother, but she wants a mother, not a friend. She wants a mum who drives her to ice skating with her friends, and sits in the stands to supervise, not one who comes onto the ice with them and tries to hang out. She says she does sometimes feel awkward at school, but she manages it most of the time, until her mum is around and then she is reminded that she's different. A lot more was said, but this was the main gist.\n\nAs for Amy, it turns out she has a lot of resentment towards our family, and even towards Ashley. She feels it's not fair that me and my parents focused so much on supporting Ashley rather than supporting Amy. She said instead of funding Ashley's education, my parents should have offered to pay for her to attend university after Ashley was born, or they should have done this instead of clearing Hugo's student loan debt. She said us caring about Ashley should have made us like her more but we all ignored her in favour of her baby, and now even her kid was abandoning her. I won't comment on this other than to say we were all shocked by what she said. \n\nThe outcome of the conversation was that Hugo and Amy decided never to tell Ashley that they almost didn't let her go on the ski trip. Ashley will start seeing a therapist to talk about what's been going on with her at home and at school, and bring her mother into some sessions if necessary. My parents have offered to fund it if it's not feasible for her parents to pay, but they're looking into it. \n\nAshley said Amy has been giving her a lot more space since she got home, and Hugo has been spending more time with her, and might start taking riding lessons with her (he played polo as a teen) for them to bond more doing something Ashley loves. Overall she seems a lot happier. Unfortunately, the things Amy said about our family have caused some issues between her and Hugo. Everyone is hoping they can work through it.\n\nSo, sort of an open ended update, but I'm really glad Ashley finally got to have the conversation she needed, and that she seems to be doing so well, because really that is all I've ever been hoping for. \n\nThank you again to everyone who took the time to comment!", "created_utc": 1673173207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106fwz5/update_my_brother_and_sil_asked_me_to_lie_to_my/", "score": 1502, "replies": ["Thank you very much for the update. I am glad you could talk it out. \nEven though you don't want to go into detail about how Amy felt after Ashley was born, I think it is important. Amy's own life was on pause having a child so early, she doesn't have a career to go back to after Ashley grew up.\nI feel like she should have asked for support but I can see where she comes from.", "I am happy to read that Ashley got to have a real conversation and can focus on the future with help.\n\nI must say, that I am not surprised Amy feels this way. She was still a teenager after all, when she became a mom. And just because somebody is an adult according to the law. It doesn't make them an adult emotionally (nor brain wise, it is still developing at that age after all). Amy will need help as well, and I do mean therapy. I hope when Hugo and Amy figure that out, you all will be willing to help as well. Ashley deserves a healthy mother, with whom she can have a real healthy relationship with.", "Amy also needs to go to therapy. Because wow. The sense of entitlement here is overpowering wow. To expect your family to fund HER education and being jealous of her own daughter is verrrrryyyy, for the lack of a better word, disturbing. Yikes.", "That sounds like real progress.", "Wow Amy just sounds like the worst. \"I got knocked up young so your family should have paid for me to go to uni\"?", "Amy sounds unhinged why should your parents have payed for her education rather than there granchilds, it's clear she's jealous of her daughter which is disturbing and I think she should be the one therapy not the poor kid. To tell her daughter that she has resentment against her own daughter wow just wow", "Thanks for the update!", "YTA, (didn\u2019t read the post was too long)", "Amy bat shit crazy if she thinks the grandparents should fund her education instead of their grandchild.", "Amy is a bit of nut... she wanted her in laws to pay for her college?? In what world does she live", "I'm sorry but alot of woman have children young(me) I work may not be what I wanted to do but I do it cause it was my choice to have a child and I didn't expect anyone else to provide for me or my son for anything especially an education. She could of easily of got off her butt and get a job and go back to school 1000's of ppl do it every day. She shouldn't of told her daughter the things she did it's disgusting and she's sounds very entitled to expect everyone to be there for her and not her daughter", "Really sad if you think about it. Amy clearly was only an adult by law. She was not emotionally an adult and one could question if she was ready to be a mom. It is clear she never worked through those emotions and they turned into some very dark and ugly resentment. She needs help. And for Ashley's sake, I hope they all figure that out. Ashley does deserve a healthy relationship with her own mom after all.", "[removed]", "I think Amy needs a therapist more than Ashley does. She's upset at the wrong people over her situation.", "I really feel sorry for Amy. She is in a no-one win situation. Even here, so much hate toward Amy. Guess there's a lot of people walking on water here. Why didn't anyone in family offer to help Amy?", "Marrying into a rich family does not entitle you to those peoples money.  And before somebody hit me with the \u201cthey should want to give her that money\u201c response.  She has a whole husband, if she wants to go to school, then her and her husband should get together and figure out how to make that happen.  It\u2019s possible that if Hugo and Amy were making efforts in that direction the in-laws might see it and decide to help out but if they don\u2019t it still doesn\u2019t make them bad people.  I\u2018m more interested in Amy and Ashley improving their relationship.", "Congratulations on your engagement. And thanks for updating.", "Keep up the good work. At this rate Amy should be out of the picture in no time then you can swoop in steal her kid like you clearly want to.", "Lots to un pick here but a stand out to me is that Amy got pregnant by the son of a rich family and imagined that made her rich too. She expected to be living the lifestyle her daughter actually is and resents everyone for that not being the case. Chuck in some emotional immaturity and boredom and you have this. NTA still though your brother has some work to do.", "Congratulations on the engagement and thanks for the update!!\n\nI worry about Amy not getting therapy in this. I understand her comments about the family are... less than savory but I hope Hugo recognizes some key things that need to happen in his house for it not to burn down. \n\nShe needs something to actually fulfill her as a person. A career would probably do wonders for her because it sounds like she feels real isolated. \n\nSuper glad Ashley was able to clear some things up and communicate with her parents about boundaries.", "ESH\n\nLook at it from Amy's POV: rich kid Hugo (polo-playing!) knocked her up, derailed her education/job/life plans, got cut off by his AH parents (bc he didn't ditch not-so-rich Amy?), so she ended up isolated and short of money while he got his education keeping his future job opps open.\n\nHere she is 11 years later, Hugo's doing ok and reconciled with his parents, her daughter is at a swanky school paid for by said grandparents, but she (Amy) doesn't have the clothes/money/job/education to fit in with the other mothers. \n\nDo OP/Hugo's parents treat her like a gold-digger that 'trapped' their precious son? OP's developed a great relationship with Ashley but doesn't get on particularly well with Amy. I'm not saying she's perfect but she seems to me to be a lonely fish-out-of-water SAHM that no-one seems to have any sympathy for and nobody really tries to include. Her daughter is embarrassed by her, her husband doesn't seem to really see any problems, and the only one giving her love is the 4-yr-old.\n\nIf there's spare cash, I would hope Amy has a good hard think about getting some training/education, then a part-time job, till her son's old enough for her to go to full-time. Then if this - at best oblivious, at worst alienating - family dumps Amy out in the cold, she has some skills to start again.", "I feel for Amy. She had a baby as a teen (her age is never mentioned, which I find off), seems she got cut out of her own family as well as her partners' during a difficult time in her life, and threw herself into trying to be a great mum. Now Ashley is growing up and being, honestly, a cruel and self centred brat. OP's family obviously is financially able to help out with education, because they pay for their granddaughter, and they paid off their son's loans (after I assume they reconciled). But Amy's just left on her own? What support did she get as a teen mother? Sounds like she didn't get a chance for education or life experiences. She made a lot of sacrifices to have Ashley, and is just generally being dismissed/unvalued. \n\nI think Amy feels she got trapped by circumstances and doesn't even have the reward of being valued by her own daughter. I don't think it's entitled or unhinged of her to be resentful of her current situation. I think she could definitely benefit from therapy to process the emotions she's probably been repressing all these years.\n\nMight help if the family generally treated her like family. Because from OP's post, I get the sense that they probably don't do that.", "Thank you for the update.   I was wondering how it turned out.   Wow.  That is a lot to unpack.  There is a lot of built-up resentment and entitlement there, though.   If she wanted to go back to school, why didn't she go when your niece was younger?  Why did she expect your parents to fund HER education?   Did she ask for help or just expect it and then sit there getting mad because they didn't jump in to like she wanted them to?  I'm glad you guys sat down and talked about it, but wow.   Hopefully, everyone keeps working on it all.   And congrats on your engagement!", "It's kinda sad that Amy spills her guts about how she feels less than compared to Ashley and that side of the family *and* she identifies the parents funding things for Ashley as a source of hurt and then the response is for the parents to fund therapy only for Ashley when Amy is clearly in desperate need of therapy too. \n\nI get that Amy isn't their blood and she isn't entitled to their money for uni or anything else, but man that has to sting.", "If there's spare cash, I would hope Amy has a good hard think about getting some training/education, then a part-time job", "Why she is grown up.\n\nShe chose to have a child and do nothing for herself.\n\nIf she wants her life to change she needs to change it her self.\n\nWhat has been doing for the last 11 years.\n\nI get that the first fee years she was looking after Ashley but when Ashley started School, why didn't Amy start doing something for herself during those hours Ashley was at school.   \n\nIf she really wanted go back to school then she should talked to her husband and made a plan with him.    \n\nLots of women are raising and getting an education and working.", "Well maybe Hugo and Amy should be paying for Ashley's education instead of the in laws. Perhaps what they are doing with their money contributes to how Amy feels.", "Thank you :)", "Nobody treats Amy like she trapped Hugo, no one even thinks that happened. Hugo is a grown man, he wasn't trapped into making his own decisions. He was cut off by our parents because they didn't think they should be subsidising the life of a husband and father, they cut me off eventually too. \n\nAmy is not their child/grandchild, I'm not sure why she would expect them to pay for her education. Hugo is not entitled to have his further education paid for, that was a generous gift.", "She was 18 when she got pregnant, 19 when she had Ashley. What is off about that?", ">why should your parents have payed for her education rather than there granchilds\n\nWhy should they have paid for their child's education? Is that a serious question you're asking as if it's not something parents do for their children every day?", "People who downvoted... did your in laws paid for your education?", "And her husband.. why would she rather them pay for her school than his debts? If those debts they would have had to pay are cleared, they logically can take out more loans for her to go to school now.", "I did not mean to defend her but I can understand why she may feel like everybody's life goes on and she is left out. Her child grows up, her family has a job and she is in the same place she was before getting pregnant. It is not up to the family or anyone else to do something against it but maybe they can understand how she feels and offer her support if they wish.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like they can afford to pay for it.  But they are her parents and they are well within their rights to refuse the money.", "Where are Amy's Parents in all this ?\n\nDoes she have any family ?\n\nDoes Amy have a Job ?\n\nWhat is Amy's life like exactly ?", ">*Nobody treats Amy like she trapped Hugo, no one even thinks that happened*\n\nGood, glad to hear it. \n\n*not sure why she would expect them to pay for her education*\n\nDidn't say that; I meant, if there's now any spare money in Hugo/Amy household budget, she should go get training/education. She'd end up less isolated, with some outside friends/contacts, plus skills to take forward.", "It was a piece of missing information that seemed suspicious. Also good job disregarding 99% of my comment.", "I think you have them mixed up.  Amy is the daughter in law, not their daughter.  Ashley is their grand child.", "She still has her 4yo little boy to handle yet so I really do hope she gets help before she does the exact same thing to him. I think maybe trying to get a part time job while the kids are at school could help but I think now she's been home that long I don't think she would want to work. I think she may of gotten use it cause if she really wanted a job or a career she could of when Ashley was younger and then done some online classes. I think she's a very entitled person towards op family, like she thinks they owe her cause she gave them Ashley at a young age.", "Amy has an on/off relationship with her mum, sometimes they're close, then they fight and don't talk for months. I think she's only seen her dad sporadically throughout her life.\n\nAmy doesn't work, no. I think she had a short lived part time job right before she got pregnant with my nephew.\n\nOn a day to day basis, I don't know what her life is like. I live abroad, and I see her every couple of months when at my parents' or when I'm picking Ashley up/dropping her off. I imagine being a SAHM to two kids is exhausting, she dedicates herself to her family, but I don't know what her timetable is or anything like that.", "I just answered the question that I could. I don't know what support Amy received, I was 17 when she got pregnant. I also don't know what kind of relationship she had with her own mother at that time, so I really don't know if her mother was there for her physically or emotionally. I know when Ashley was young Amy didn't socialise much because she lost a lot of friends after dropping out, but that's really all I know about that time.", "Thank you for this information.", "You're literally only one year younger than her. Is that meant to be an explanation for why you've seemingly got zero relationship or interest in your sister in law? You don't know if she had support? You don't know if she talks to her mum? You don't know if your parents helped her out? Couldn't send her a friend request on FB and ask how she's doing? It's been eleven years. Never had a conversation with the woman?", "I know she has a on/off relationship with her mum now, so I don't know if they were on/off then. My parents bought a lot of baby stuff (cot, toys, pram, etc) for them. Hugo and Amy brought Ashley over every weekend when she was a baby and my parents babysat her when Hugo was going through exam periods at university while she was very young. \n\nI've obviously had conversations with Amy, but not long or deep ones because Amy doesn't like me, hasn't since we were teenagers. She does things like call me a hooker at dinner parties. She's Ashley's mother, so I don't fight with her and I don't ever say anything bad about her, but she quite clearly does not want to be my friend. Which is her prerogative.", "I\u2019m shocked by the comment section. While you can disagree with what Amy wants she was just sharing how she feels. She was a child when she got pregnant and now 11 years later, her kid is on the brink of becoming a teenager and being more independent and she\u2019s not in a good place because she went from a child to a mum and doesn\u2019t know who she is.", ">my parents should have offered to pay for her to attend university after Ashley was born, or they should have done this instead of clearing Hugo's student loan debt.\n\nI'm sorry; she thinks her in laws should have paid for her to go to university over paying for THEIR OWN SON'S student debt?\n\nShe's the one that needs to go to therapy.", "Wow. \n\nSo they are sending Ashly to therapy\u2026. I mean that\u2019s great that she get a place to went with a professional.\n\nBut damn I mean Ashly is Not then one most in need of a therapist in these two posts. \n\nAmy takes that prize by not just a mile but a whole marathon", "Amy seems to have developed the habit of blaming other people for her choices.", "I feel really sorry for Amy, she is surrounded by privileged people living privileged lives whilst she is left out on the side. \n\nHer daughter has been included in this privilege but she has not, which is one of the reasons her own daughter looks down on her as she sees that her mother is treated differently from the rest of them, I guess she was nothing more than the incubator and free child care.", "Amy needs therapy. I hope she gets it.", "I feel bad for Amy. Her child got sucked in by the lure of money, and it seems she'll never get her back.", "The entitlement", "So Amy and Hugo got cut off until your parents decided they wanted to be around the grandbaby? Was Amy just a walking womb? I feel for her.", "So, Amy's version of the problem is \"you should have funded my life instead of my child's\". Wow, that's some major entitlement. She needs more therapy than Ashley.", "Honestly this update makes me feel really sad for Amy. She ended up pregnant way to young and it sounds like she never got to go to post secondary, build her own career or develop her own identity. Her whole identity has been being a mom but now her daughter is pulling away from her. It sounds like Amy has always been an outsider to your family, and has probably been mostly ignored or treated badly, while you openly accepted her daughter and by the sounds of it spoiled her. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I feel sorry for Ashley too, because I relate to her. I was that teenager who was embarrassed by my parents and pulled away and never felt like I fit in with my peers. Honestly, they both need therapy to help resolve these issues. And OP, I think it would be nice if you tried to get to know Amy more and try to develop more of a relationship with her. Honestly, her life seems horrible and you and your family seem like a contributing factor.", "Thanks for the update. Amy sounds very immature and I hope she gets therapy too.", "I hope your family reflect on everything Amy said. Your parents left two teenagers to figured out How to raise their child without any support and only \"help\" when the child was already born. They should have support the mother of their grandchild and instead It looks like you ALL looked down on her and now are the \"heroes\" of their daugher's life because you pay a fancy school and fancy things and everything her parents do can't ever compare. Amy is a saint to even let you guys be so close of her daugher...", "Assuming Amy was the same age as OP's brother when she got pregnant, it's pretty clear that she never got a chance to go through early adulthood and learn how to be her own person outside of her identity as a mother and wife. That can fuck a person up. Maybe I'm being overly sympathetic, but it really just makes me sad. She got pregnant too young, and isn't emotionally mature enough to build a stable and healthy relationship with her daughter as she's growing. I agree with you, she needs to be in therapy.", "On the other hand, sometimes mom's get really left behind. For some, our families expect us to do all the caregiving and nurturing, but the love and all the financials of the family go to the husband and children. It can make a mom feel really lonely and unloved, taken for granted. I can really hear that here and it makes me sad for Amy.\n\nI really feel for Amy after reading this. Her husband needs to take what she says seriously and see how he can support his wife's personal growth. That's great that he wants to spend time with Ashley bit he needs to help Amy. It isn't the responsibility of the larger family, but it is definitely her husband's job in the relationship to ensure he supports her as much as she gives to everyone else.\n\nShe sounds really lonely. OP, this story isn't over. I hope you take some time to think about how this feels from Amy's point of view. If you have it in your heart to be a sympathetic ear to her, that might be nice.", "I think OP buried the lede on this one. Amy was 18 when she got pregnant, that's her first year of uni then she was isolated/drifted away from friends as a SAHM. It's no wonder that she has resentment issues. Is it really entitlement to want an education after being knocked up by a rich kid (polo) as a teen. On top of that her in-laws don't even seem to like her", "The lack of grace/sympathy you\u2019re extending to Amy is simply astounding. As other commenters have noted she had a child fairly young and at a pivotal developmental stage, to the detriment that she missed out on a lot of formative experiences which clearly she wishes she\u2019d had. I do agree that it\u2019s a bit much to expect to have had your in-laws fund your education, but at the same time the underlying issue shes expressing is that, to quote someone replying to you, she feels left behind. It's natural/fortunate for financially able grandparents and aunts/uncles to dote in their younger relatives but, to me the subtext here is that Ashley essentially feels like a broodmare who pushed out a kid and was then left to simply be \"Amy's mom.\" There are plenty of people for whom that would be sufficient but obviously for Ashley it's not. \n\nI'm really trying to walk the razor's edge of fairness here because I do agree at a high level with your assessment that she needs to work through this for herself rather than blaming others but I also think the tenor of your response is fairly callous and uncharitable.", "Not just entitled but so entitled it skews her thinking. She resents them paying off her husband\u2019s student loan debt when she benefits immensely from that generosity.", "Low and high ses people are always going to have a hard time in a relationship together because the culture of abundance and scarcity are so at odds. You will be so much happier on average if you have similar cultures. Wear a condom kids!", "This was my exact first thought too when reading this.", "Also, if the family paid to clear out Hugo's debt, how is that functionally different from paying for Amy's education? Similar amount of money, just one thing being paid off instead of the other. They would have been in the same financial position though. That seems more like a problem between Hugo and Amy.", "Agreed.  And to not even grasp that by clearing her husband\u2019s debt, that wd have cleared the way for her to go to school too.  And I cd never EVER imagine being jealous that my child received a benefit that would help them in life.  Honestly she needs therapy more than her daughter does.", "Yeah. Id jump at the chance to help my siblings\u2019 kids. My siblings\u2019 partners? Not so much.", "Yeah, I kind of get it but also don't. If OP's parents paid for Ashley's education and Hugo's loans, the family should have more spare money and could afford the college fees for Amy (of paying back government loans as OP stated).", "Was thinking the same thing.", "This 100%! \n\nIt\u2019s rather disgusting she feels that way. Being that they cleared Hugo\u2019s school debt, she could go back now. If she truly wanted to go to school and get a degree, she\u2019d find a way to do it on her own.", "This is true, but like her education, she can't sit there and wait for it to be given to her. She has to do the work to make it happen. If that means asking for help with payment after finding and scheduling, she will have to ask.", "I agree with you- also maybe she left forgotten as a person and only seen as a mum? It also seems like Amy felt that Ashley was treated as more part of OP\u2019s family then she was- which I can agree with. In-laws can often treat grandchildren better and forget the mothers.", ">Why didn\u2019t anyone in family offer to help Amy? \n\nNow or after Ashley was born? For the latter, did she *ask?* I would find it incredibly rude if I had a kid and my in-laws went \u201cWell, time to go back to school! We\u2019ll pay for it!\u201d \n\nAs for now\u2026that\u2019s something that needs a little more discussion than a \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you say so? We\u2019ll get right on funneling tens of thousands of dollars towards your education at the drop of a hat!\u201d \n\nAnd seriously - how greedy can you get? Your husbands student loans were paid off, removing a mountain of debt from the shoulders of her little family, and the response is \u201cthat should\u2019ve gone to me even though I never said anything to indicate that\u201d???", "She sounds like she has a difficult personality. I would personally resent having to consider someone who openly hated all of us family.", "I agree the demand is harsh but I also think Amy likely got that extreme demand from years of resentment and  been givin nothing. At 18 she had to give up her life and education, and while so did her husband, he still managed to get an education and 'rewarded' by it being payed off and reconnecting with his family while she still has a bad relationship with in-laws and her own. She likely just wants someone to acknowledge what she was able to do was hard and to be able to have some of her own expierances. Tbh, school was just an example, she just wants freedom.  Again I agree that's something her and her husband should discuss, but we can't ignore that the in-laws past bad actions which set the course of this family. Yeah Amy and Ashley's relationship should completely be the main focus,  I just think its unfair to view amy as simpley feeling \"entilted\" to the money .", "It takes 2 to get knocked up.", "This is my thinking. I honestly feel bad for Amy. Losing friends and family because of kids is hard. I hope Amy goes back to school and gets a real life soon. (Speaking as a STHM with no education because of kids and lack of support.)", ">but she doesn\u2019t have the clothes/money/education to fit in with the other mothers \n\nThis is such an incredibly selfish thing to be hung up on. \u201cMy in-laws are paying for an incredible educational opportunity for my daughter, which will inevitably open doors for her that only money can, but won\u2019t anything think about the fact that the other moms dress better than me??? Why isn\u2019t anyone helping fix that??? :(\u201c\n\nIf what you\u2019ve described is her real POV, she\u2019s incredibly greedy for thinking that getting knocked up by a rich dude means she deserves his family\u2019s money, which even *he* isn\u2019t getting right now. If they didn\u2019t treat her as a gold digger, they sure as hell should now that she essentially threw a mini-tantrum and said \u201cwhy didn\u2019t anyone, without me asking, offer to pay tens-of-thousands for me to get a degree instead of relieving us of crippling student loan debt or funding a great education for my child?? What about meeeeeee!\u201d", "I\u2019m guessing Amy feels detached from her family and not entirely a part of her husband\u2019s family.", "How is Ashley being \u201ccruel\u201d and a \u201cbrat\u201d? Not wanting your mom to hang out with your friends is perfectly normal. She isn\u2019t a brat for not wanting to be smothered, wtf?", "Why should her sacrifices be valued? It was Amy's decision to have a kid at that age - they live in the UK, abortion is accessible. You don't get to blame others for your choices. And Ashley was always supported by her grandparents and OP - which in turn made life easier for Amy. They are saving money on Ashley's education and don't have to pay loans as a family. Also she's not working and never really was according to OP.", "It takes two to tango. Maybe she thought by baby trapping someone rich she will get the easy life. Maybe it was just entitlement. We can't know unless OP says something.", "So my parents should not have bought anything for Ashley as a baby? Shouldn\u2019t have offered her a chance at a great education? I shouldn\u2019t have offered her the chance to pursue her interests? Amy wasn\u2019t born into privilege so Ashley shouldn\u2019t have opportunities? What parent doesn\u2019t want more choices for their child?", "They were cut off financially, they were always in contact with my parents. My parents still do not fund their lifestyle, just Ashley\u2019s (and my nephew\u2019s) education.", "Genuine question: if you didn\u2019t read it, why did you comment?", "It\u2019s probably triggered by the fact Ashley is getting more independent. Amy went from being a teenager to a mum and now 11 years later she doesn\u2019t know who she is, that\u2019s probably why she wants an education or job.", "I agree. Amy is not being a good mum, but I think a lot of women will recognise that feeling that suddenly you're pregnant and no one sees you as anything other than a birthing machine and a mother to a baby. Not only are your emotional and even physical needs overlooked, you're considered selfish for having needs - especially if those needs are in conflict with the baby's needs. \n\nIt sounds like she had a really difficult time and that no one was really emotionally there for her.

I feel sad for Amy. It sounds like she really made herself vulnerable, finally admitted that it's hard for her to see all these advantages go to her daughter while she (Amy) is only just barely tolerated by everyone, and now her daughter is starting to do the same thing...and everyone's response was to get the daughter therapy and horseback riding lessons.\n\nI wonder if Amy wasn't actually saying that she expected her education to be funded, but instead just pointing out that it was a possibility. It only never occurred to them because they only see her as an incubator/caregiver, and not an actual person.", "and being rich herself, OP does not get it", "Thank you. All these posts focusing on Amy's entitlement, are accepting OP's version at face value. Amy became pregnant to the son of rich parents who then cut them off. Was it because he got a girl pregnant or the wrong girl pregnant? Not clear, but what OP does make clear in her original post is that Amy's entire universe shrank down to being Ashley's mom at 18 and has stayed that small. Amy's communication sounds immature. Her life and development basically ended at 18, so that's pretty unsurprising. She focuses on money as the source of inclusion and love - because that's what OP's entire family, including OP, does. OP's parents cut Amy and Hugo off, then gradually began bringing everyone back into the fold via money (Hugo's student debt, Ashley's tuition), except Amy. OP loves Ashley and lavishes her with expensive gifts and trips that Ashley's own mother can't afford. Ashley attends a school where both she and Amy are an outsider to the rest of the wealthy families, and now Ashley's mocking Amy's clothes, which don't include a regular rotation of Birkins and other high end items. \n\nAmy's attachment to Ashley is unhealthy. Her emotional development sounds stunted, and she focuses on money because that's what everyone around her does. But Ashley is Amy's only lifeline to the rest of the world and has been since she was 18, and this family has systematically weaponized their wealth to cut that line off. Amy needs therapy and a way to find herself and a supportive community separate from her child and her in-laws .", "It still takes two to tango. Maybe it's her baby trapping him. We don't know. But she absolutely needs therapy.", "It's a sad situation in general, same way I feel about most teen/student mothers, so I get where the initial feeling of missing out comes from. I do think it is entitled to then hold that resentment against the family though. Of course grandparents focused on the baby---thats what grandparents DO. It's normal to wish that they would have given you some money/opportunities, but it also doesn't sound like she brought it up at all. So just expecting to be given money and feeling resentful for YEARS when you didn't get it is pretty entitled at worst, poor communication at best.", "And we don't know that she wasn't grateful for the help provided at first. She honestly could have been grateful for it but as time passed and she kept feeling slighted or ignored or looked over, it turned into resentment. A death of a thousand cuts.

And more than that, she *wanted* that for me, she worked for me to have everything she didn\u2019t and could even dream of. To me, that\u2019s what mothers do, they want better for their kids and they\u2019re glad when they get it. They don\u2019t seethe that no one offered it to them.

However, acting this way specifically because they didn't pay for her tuition fees is ridiculous.\n\nContext for anyone not familiar with the UK student loans system: The vast majority of students take out student loans from the government. They arent like normal loans - they have no effect on credit rating and are written off after 30 years from graduation with no consequences. You don't repay if you're earning under ~\u00a325000 a year, and even then it's pro-rated at 9% of income over this threshold - if she earned \u00a31 over the threshold, she would pay back \u00a30.09 a year. Most students never repay in full.\n\nIf she went to uni 11-12 years ago, her tuition fees would have been \u00a33000 a year for a 3 year full-time course, or the equivalent for a part-time course depending on credits - so with this resentment being about the tuition fees according to Amy, she's ruining her family relationships over \u00a39000 she feels entitled to, for a loan that she likely would never have paid back anyway.", "Op maybe for Ashley and Hugo's  sake talk to your parents  to fund  therapy  for Amy too.

She is the one who needs therapy, like right now, not Ashley.", "Congratulations on your engagement! I wish you all the best. \n\nThank you for updating us. I think you're a great aunt.\n\nI don't think your parents did anything wrong in the past. Amy just wanted them to support her in the way they didn't support you or Hugo, so how could she have gotten something even their own children didn't? Your parents and Amy simply have a different idea of what support should look like but she isn't entitled to blame them for that. I think she blames and resents them because her life was hard long before she met Hugo, and always wanted a family she never had. It's up to Hugo and herself to form that family though, and not your parents. \n\nAmy's frustration is misplaced, and I think Hugo is shocked to hear that. It's probably mostly about the resentment about their differences, and now she sees Ashley getting what Hugo did growing up while Amy herself doesn't.\n\nBut Amy didn't grow up with your parents - they met her as an adult - and your parents don't support adults, just children. Your parents saw Amy and Hugo as adults. You and Hugo were adults when you moved out and formed your own relationships. All of these adults were equally not financially supported by your parents. Ashley is a child so they support her.\n\nKnowing this, how could have your parents ever supported Amy? \n\nThis is just who they are. And they have the right to be so.\n\nI hope Amy understands that.", "Wow, I can\u2019t imagine resenting my child for having things I didn\u2019t. I want my son to have everything I couldn\u2019t have as a child and more.

I say this as someone who grew up with a mom that was jealous of the attention/support her parents (my grandparents) gave me, even though I was a child and they also did a lot for her. The resentment drove a wedge between me and my mother, and between my mother and her parents and I am no contact with her now as an adult (for a mix of reasons).", "I wonder is she feel she sacrificed her education while it sounds like Hugo got to further his education. I can understand her being mad at the isolation that came with being a 20 year old mom who gave up her financial goals in life. It\u2019s definitely warped her thinking process, but it\u2019s hard to blame her if she truly was the stay home mom and never had a choice in how she shaped her life and step family relationships from 19-24.", "Any is the one on need of therapy. Jfc, imagine thinking uour boyfriend's family should fund your education. The entitlement is disgusting. Fucking hell.", "Is Amy a narcissist?", "I'm happy that it's now working out for your family but this is really a prime example why very young people shouldn't get kids", "A lot of people are coming down super hard on Amy, and that's understandable.

Hugo as his husband should be trying to make her happy and fulfilled but seems to be as lost as her. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t go to therapy it\u2019s not going to end well for her and her family.", "I hope Amy gets the chance to get her degree. Maybe it will take the pressure off Ashley if she's occupied in some other fulfilling way.", "Amy was totally right. I couldn't comment on original post but yall just wanted your brother's kid.... not his partner.  Why send the kid to a high class school when the kid herself knows her parents can't afford????

Being jealous over her daughter to the point it ruining their relationship is not healthy. Saying her parents should have paid for her to go to school not clear your brother their son college debt. Wow did she get pregnant on purpose so they pay for her?", "Amy needs to stop making everything about her. I understand wanting to go to university, but seriously I would love for my family to pay for the things your family does. It sounds like she's decided on a narrative that everyone screws her over all the time and now she looks into every action from you guys as a way to prove her point.  Viewing her daughter as competition is a problem. Ashley picks up on that, whether Amy sees it or not.", "There is nothing stopping Amy from going to college and finding herself. Your parents don't owe her in financing her education. They were generous enough to pay for your brother and niece's education. Your brother and SIL should figure out how to fund her education. Maybe Amy needs to develop herself to be a happier individual.", "I can feel empathy for this teen who was thrust unexpectedly into adult parenthood, especially since your parents cut off your brother at the beginning.  She must have felt overwhelmed and scared.  She is an adult now, however, and needs to come to terms with the self-destructive feelings she's dealing with.  More than Ashley, Amy needs a therapist to help guide her through to a healthy relationship with all of you.", "> Unfortunately, the things Amy said about our family have caused some issues between her and Hugo\n\nI would imagine so, it just sounds like she is jealous of her own child recieving things she wanted. It is easy to hold jealousy, but to hold it to this extent as to not want her to go on trips or self insert herself into her daughters life is wild to me. She too needs to see someone about these feelings. I hope it all works out.", "How toxic. I hope Amy gets a divorce when kid reaches majority. How terrible it'd be to be tied to these people.", "Hugo should\u2019ve taken care of Amy not his family. Amy held it down taking care of his child while he\u2019s went to school and he should\u2019ve given her the same opportunity\n\nadults experience the same feelings of being left out and othered as kids.

Co-sign on therapy", "Yes Amy needs help but from her young teenage pregnancy she was pidgeoned in to one role. Mom. And though well supported in that role, she may have been forgotten as a person that had dreams and aspirations.  That's where resentment starts.  I hope therapy helps and then she gets a chance to go back to school or pursue a career or something that makes her feel whole again.", "It sounds weirdly competitive between mother and daughter and the daughter doesn\u2019t even know there was a competition. Amy definitely needs professional support to address these issues", "I think Amy ought to be cut some slack. She was a teenage mum, and added to this the wealth disparity can be a real obstacle. I\u2019ve seen in couples with such disparities there can be friction because the poorer person struggles with feelings of inadequacy and especially that they\u2019re not bringing very much to the table\u2026 and the better off person brushes it off - \u201cthere\u2019s no need to feel that way\u201d. Maybe the instinct is to pretend it\u2019s not an issue, because to acknowledge makes them feel like they\u2019re not being generous.

This is clearly ESH, and this update confirms my suspicions. \n\nI very much am getting that this is a very rich family that Amy married into. And it very much seems like the rich family looks down on her. She is absolutely right to be upset that they didn\u2019t pay for her to go to uni (which it seems like would not have been hard), and she has every right to feel left out. She probably feels left out by her daughter too, which makes it all worse,", "This is so true. I hope they learn from this situation with Ashley and listen more to each other - starting with Amy. The update shows they still don\u2019t seem to be hearing Amy.", "Amy's life did not pause.  It changed.", "Exactly! Amy needs to start advocating for herself and stop blaming everyone else.", "As a mom who had a daughter at 18, I admit that I have very little sympathy for Amy. She\u2019s resentful of her daughter and husband for receiving support from their family that benefits her! If she really wanted to go to school, she could have made it a priority but chose not to. Now if, Hugo prevented her from doing that, then it\u2019s a different story but the resentment towards her daughter is disheartening and explains why the daughter doesn\u2019t want her around.", "I don\u2019t feel sorry for her at all. She\u2019s an adult responsible for herself. If she wasn\u2019t happy, she could\u2019ve left and did her own thing. It is literally insane. She expected her husbands family to pay for anything for her. And she\u2019s literally jealous of her own child! That shows the type of person she really is and I don\u2019t even know how Hugo could stay with someone like her.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. She chose to have that child. It is absolutely insane that she literally expected his family to pay for anything for her. They are not her parents. She chose to sleep with someone and have a child. She should be thankful for everything she has because she wouldn\u2019t have anything if it wasn\u2019t for OPS parents.", "I really hope that Hugo is supporting his wife getting into therapy as well. There's not enough info to say what his role in all this is, but given that he was surprised by her feelings in this chat, I'm guessing for whatever reason she never felt safe expressing herself to him. (Which again, a guess. I don't know these people.)\n\nBut yeah, it's clear that Amy feels like she's been reduced to \"Mom\" and is trying to process how much she clearly doesn't like that. Even OP is more focused on how she is as a mother (commenting on how she can't understand how Amy can resent her own child) and focuses primarily on their niece. Amy isn't a person to these people, she's just a mother -- she probably feels like a shadow.\n\nThe whole thing just feels like a big mess, and I suspect Amy didn't leave that conversation feeling any more emotionally supported than when this started.", "OP's family probably was like: our son/brother you got some commoner pregnant? why couldn't he have found a girl who also played polo growing up?", "The place where Amy loses me is in her choices. She sets herself up as a rival to OP by continuing to accept her financial support but treating her like crap. She accepts the financial support from her in-laws but is mad they don\u2019t give it to her. She wants to be best friends with an 11-year-old and gets mad when her daughter doesn\u2019t reciprocate. \n\nAnd no where do we see Amy accepting any responsibility for anything. None of her problems are something she feels she should have to deal with. Amy wants OP to fix her relationship with Ashley by lying to Ashley. She wants her in-laws to fix her identity crisis by redirecting their gifts from her children to her. I\u2019d love to know what Amy thinks is her own responsibility to fix.", "She was 18 when she got pregnant, 19 by the time she had Ashley.", "Aw I wish I\u2019d had Richard Gilmore as a dad, he had good jokes. My dad\u2019s are cringe.", "Amy also resents her daughter and her daughter picks up on that.", "Amy would definitely benefit from therapy, and I hope she and Hugo look into it.\n\nI don't think she got pregnant on purpose. I've never thought of her as particularly conniving.", "Exactly! It\u2019s like the prince knocked up the maid, tried to stand by her in a cottage and now they\u2019re trying to wheedle him and the kids away to the castle with their gold. If my daughter dissed me for being the poor mum at her fancy school my husband would have seriously threatened to bounce her right into state school and make her take college loans!!  Rich people!", "This is what I believe that the people who are calling Amy entitled are missing. She got pregnant young and became isolated socially and put her life on hold to care for the child. During which, her husband essentially was able to continue living his life. He got to finish his education and most likely had more of a social life than her.\n\nHas anybody even bothered to make sure Amy isn't suffering from depression? She could be having problems with her mental health which can explain the illogical behavior. IMHO, she needs therapy including marriage counseling.", "I wrote this at 2am my time but I stand by most of what I said. I am not lacking empathy because I do see that she was barely an adult when she had Ashley and married Hugo. I was about to ask where her parents are but I then read somewhere that her family cut her off. Which is really heartbreaking in itself. So ya my heart goes out to her on that aspect. \n\nBut that does not entitle her to her in laws money. They paid off Hugo\u2019s debt (their child) and are providing for her children\u2019s future (their grandchildren). As a PARENT she should be grateful. It\u2019s obvious that she is stuck in a state of attested development and is lashing out at the wrong people. Hence why needs therapy.", "My ex was also upset that I used 10k my parents gave me to pay off my student loans rather using it in a way that she directly benefited from. The older I get the more I realize how much I can't stand entitlement.", "Well we only get OP\u2019s view and she lives abroad so we don\u2019t know if Amy and Hugo have had this discussion (it doesn\u2019t seem like it for how Hugo has reacted in the aftermath) but that is an issue between spouses. Not resenting the IL\u2019s for providing for her children nor resenting her daughter. Her foundation of resentment I feel is at the wrong people.", "What is ses?", "If she had asked, maybe but just because they could doesn\u2019t mean they should. She is their daughter in law, not their daughter. She is not entitled to their money. And if I\u2019m correct, most of Reddit tends to usually say no one is entitled to anyone\u2019s money.", "It really is telling that the family\u2019s response was to only offer to pay for therapy for Ashley. They didn\u2019t even mention therapy for Amy despite acknowledging that it would benefit her too.", "Whose inlaws pay for them to go to uni? Amy is entitled, made a bad decision at a young age, but is now old enough to grow up and take responsibility for herself.", "Not really go back to school it sounds like from the money situation. Fully paid off their sons debt and school costs for the grandchild( reason being the parents could not afford it). She was a stay at home mom with no support or what sounds like even money to help her dreams. Could she  have more vocally voiced them? Sure. Do I blame her for that? No.", "That\u2019s what I forgot to put in my comment, which I wrote at 2am my time and couldn\u2019t go to sleep so I came to Reddit lol (sidebar: I kept hearing noises at my sisters house and it was freaking me out because the dogs were chillin and I thought I was insane. But I digress). \n\nWhatever Amy feels that she missed out on is an issue between her and her husband. Whether or not that was communicated we don\u2019t know. But for Amy to have resentment against her in laws for not paying or helping her pay for her own future is mind boggling. And being envious of her daughter\u2019s prospects screams immaturity which makes sense because she was barely an adult when she had Ashley. And man kids pick up on energy it\u2019s insane and who knows how long Ashley has felt the negative energy from her mom. \n\nMy point is: Amy isn\u2019t entitled to any money from her in laws. If she had asked for help, then maybe I can see that somewhat. And I am sad that her identity has been shaped into only a mom. But that\u2019s between her and husband. Not against her child.", "Don\u2019t get why you were down voted, you are absolutely right. The second daughter started school, she could\u2019ve got a job or went back to school. She just wants to complain about everything. And think she\u2019s entitled to everything.", "Did them cutting him off also mean he paid for his own education and they didn\u2019t just decide later that he\u2019s been a good boy so we will pay for it? If not they didn\u2019t really cut him off.", "Can they easily afford to? She\u2019s the mother of their grandchildren, why is it so hard to imagine them paying for it since it sounds like they can?\n\nMore importantly, why didn\u2019t Hugo help her go to uni?\n\nIt absolutely sounds like you all look down on her despite your best attempts to hide it.", "I completely agree with you. She is not their child and it is absolutely ridiculous that she expected them to pay for her schooling or anything in the first place. It shows her true colors that she is literally jealous of her own daughter. If that was me, I would be so freaking happy, and so thankful to have such amazing grandparents that love my child, and treat my child so good. I actually do have amazing grandparents for my children, not rich like yours tho, but they are really amazing and I am really thankful.", "I don\u2019t think the in-laws did anything wrong.  But I do agree that mom needs her own identity.  I\u2019m the oldest of four and my mom had me at 18.  Her life revolved around us and our activities growing up and now she\u2019s a empty nester(dad died last year) and she doesn\u2019t know who she is as person.  This however is something she should address with her husband.  If it\u2019s a financial issue the he should talk to his parents about help.  It\u2019s just weird to expect it from them and to call them bad people for not offering.", "Well, insulting your SIL by calling her a hooker is NOT the way to gain the love of your in-laws. \n\nIf this story is true, then it sounds like Hugo and Amy need marriage counseling and Amy needs a therapist.", "She said she didn\u2019t want her mom to chaperone her because she dresses badly and embarrasses her.

That is awful.", "Did you miss how she talked to her mom?", "Is that great education the reason you misspell niece in your username?", "My parents paid off my SILs student loans when she married into the family. Why is that so weird? They are a newly married couple and you would want them to start life off on the best possible footing. They also covered all our weddings and some startup money to cover initial expenses.

But I couldn\u2019t get through the re-boot without his character - just too sad.", "I dislike this solely because of the \"she's not being a good mum\" comment. The mom shaming in our society is so overused and misplaced. She's clearly not being a bad parent, she's overly involved and smothering her daughter with too much attention. She's listening and starting to back off, which are signs of her being a good parent - taking the feedback and changing. That's not a bad mother. She's fed, clothed, loved, attended to. There's barely mention of dad except he's starting to spend more time with daughter, so where's the \"bad dad\" comments?\n\nOtherwise I am fully on board with you for everything else. Being a parent is hard, there's no direction manual and you basically run off instincts until someone gives you course correction which sounds like what happened here. It's even harder when you become a parent as a late teen/early 20 something. You haven't finished growing up psychologically and now you have to sacrifice your personhood to raise a new human. Amy definitely needs counseling and some empathy and also some correction on her entitlement expectations, but who knows how much money has been thrown at them over the years along with comments about how she's not doing anything to better herself? That can get untangled and fixed via some therapy, and it sounds like they're receptive to getting help which is refreshing for a change. \n\nBest wishes to them all and kudos to OP for being so involved in her niece's life, what a treasure \u2764\ufe0f", "Was indeed very eye opening to finally have doctors listen to me when I was pregnant and then immediately dismiss my concerns after I went home after a c section and started being extremely nauseous and throwing up. (super fun after having your abdomen sliced open a few days previously btw)\n\nFinally they prescribed antibiotics and I started feeling better.  But I have to wonder if my milk would have come in if they had fucking listened to me earlier and not just said \"it's normal to feel like shit after a c section\"", "I get that it has been difficult to see your partner go to college, and then your child going to private school, all while you had to give up your college dream after high school. But they absolved Hugo's loans *and* with Ashley's education paid for, what makes it difficult for Amy to go to college *now*? A lot of people go to college at an older age. When I went to university, one of our classmates was a elderly woman who had to quit school due to WWII. She always wanted to be a veterinarian, so she decided to study for it during her pension, even if it was to late to actually become a veterinarian.\n\nMore importantly, why do OP's parents have to pay for her education? Where are *her own parents*? Shouldn't she be mad *at them*? Cruel to say maybe, but OP's parents don't have to finance their son's *partner*. Sure, OP's parents really dropped the ball with cutting Hugo of completely, but that doesn't entitle *her* to their money. She should target her anger at the people who let her down, which (on a financial ground) are not OP's parents, is not OP, and definitely is not *Ashley*.", "I don't know about that \"help\", OP mentioned that her parents cut off her brother and SIL when they married. It seems they let two college age kids to flounder then paid off the debt later on. \n\nI'll admit that her definition of \"cut off\" is also a bit odd. It seems like her parents didn't give them any financial aid but gave them toddler supplies and occasionally looked after Ashley", "Indeed. She is lashing at the wrong people. Where is Hugo in all this? He should be doing what he can to help his wife get her life back on track.", "And where is the support for Amy to work through her feelings? Where are the attempts to show her that she is valued and a part of the family? Ashley is getting therapy and riding lessons.

I understood that my parents struggled paying bills so it made little sense, as an adult, to expect them to pay for something like college. I took two years off after high school to pay for my education, although they did offer (and I accepted) some help in the first year. After that it was all from working/awards.\n\nI think I've read about it being required by law for parents to pay for children's higher education in some places, but I'm not sure if that's true or how much it even costs for them.", "He took out student loans to pay for his education. When he was finished, my parents said they were proud of what he\u2019d managed to achieve (studying, working to support a family, getting a graduate job, taking responsibility) and as a gift they paid off the debt.

I could afford to, I love him a lot, he\u2019s very valuable to be, but I don\u2019t, because he\u2019s a grown adult, if he wants a car, he needs to buy one. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s financially feasible for Hugo to pay the fees upfront, but in the UK uni is government funded, she can go any time she wants and will pay the loan back when she earns enough to afford it. It\u2019s not inaccessible to her with or without my parents", "But Amy\u2019s idea of being around is hanging out on the ice with the eleven-year-olds while they are ice skating. That\u2019s not going to make her fit in either.

Ashley\u2019s requests for her mom to lay off and give her some independence with her friends fell on deaf ears numerous times, so she went about it in a mean way because she\u2019s eleven and is still learning. She was also punished for this, as she should have been. Canceling a ski trip as Amy wanted was a gross overreaction and shows immaturity on her part. She\u2019s the parent, and she sounds jealous of her own daughter\u2019s opportunities.", "Yes. Literally, at the finishing school I went to, they told us real ladies never spell a whole sentence corectly. It's so we don't ruin our marriage prospekts by being coming off too intelligent.\n\nAlso could have been a quick typing oversight that I didn't bother to correct because this is a throwaway account.\n\nI'll bet you the price of university tuition you can't guess which explanation is true ;)", "Yes, in the UK everyone is entitled to a student loan for their first degree. It is the cheapest loan anyone will ever have and, whilst people get caught up in the fact it\u2019s a loan, it doesn\u2019t impact credit score in the slightest - it isn\u2019t counted as debt when applying for a mortgage for example - and you also only start paying it back after you start earning a certain amount annually. It\u2019s automatically paid from your salary too so it never even hits your account, for me it\u2019s just \u00a395 a month taken from my paycheck that I never see.\n\nDue to this system, very few people who want to go to university in the UK can\u2019t afford to. It\u2019s not perfect (perfect would it be being totally free) but it\u2019s much, much better than in the US. It enables a lot of people from low income households be able to go to whichever university they choose due to their grades and talent, not having to factor in which costs the least.", "Most likely not an option because she dropped out and didn't get to complete her degree after getting pregnant/having the baby. Which would make her ineligible for future education funds. Her husband, of course, got to finish his education and retain all the same opportunities in life as his childless friends. Amy probably lost all her friends in this transition too. His parents cut him off right at the time when the obvious result would be that Amy has no choice but to stay at home with the baby for the next few years, and give up her own education and future prospects. Because nobody expects the husband to do that. And they wouldn't have had funds for a nanny or daycare. \n\nI think Amy should've been more proactive about getting her life back many years ago, after her kid started full time school. But that said, it's pretty clear her husband's wealthy family has zero empathy for her. Just no understanding of her situation and sacrifices whatsoever. They are shocked just shocked oh so surprised to hear about her true feelings now (including her own husband!) because they've never truly considered her in all this. To everyone calling her entitled. I bet most of you would feel the same way in her place. She was isolated at a very young age, and has spent her entire adult life with everyone around her (her husband, her kid, all her kid's friends, etc.) living in a different world financially. Again, yes, she should have looked into getting a job earlier, but it's not easy without a degree, which she didn't have funds to access. She should have asked for those funds, but was probably too embarrassed to ask his family for money for herself. Especially when they knew she had to drop out and chose that time to cut off financial help, so they made it clear they don't value her education or future right from the beginning. They have always treated her like that's what she's worth to them, an unpaid nanny to their beloved spoiled grandchild.

My grandparents employed it my entire life, and my in-laws have attempted to. As an adult, I've been very careful to avoid asking for or taking money from either.

Proves my point further.\n\nI am not saying they have to, but that they should if they can. It\u2019s not entitlement when the parents clearly throw money around to show favor.\n\nAlso, this is referring to when they were still young teens. Amy\u2019s complaint is they didn\u2019t do it at the time, not now.", "What does that even mean? In what capacity are they NOT treating Amy like family?\n\nOPs point is that they\u2019re not treating her like they are HER parents or grandparents and they\u2019re NOT. If my child got married I would find it extremely uncomfortable, strange, weird and entitled if THEIR (my child) spouse thought I should pay for THEIR (the spouses) education.\n\nBased on comments from OP, they have helped support Amy by helping to support their grandchild and removing the burden of their son\u2019s loans on the household. As well as being active in Ashley\u2019s life and helping with childcare.\n\nIt sounds like Amy got a bunch excuses as to why her life doesn\u2019t look the way it does. According to OP Amy could have gone to college too (Hugo went and took out loans), what was Amy doing during this time? It seems like the parents would have been more than happy to pay / help with child care. \n\nAmy may have thought she won the lotto, but was sadly mistaken she OPs parents (rightly so) cut him off because he was an adult.", "This is what it sounds like to me. She thought she hit a jackpot and was perplexed when Hugo\u2019s parents were clear that they weren\u2019t going to basically spend their money supporting a grown man and his family.", "It does not sound like a financial thing to me, or that she wants money now - she wanted to go to uni, and for grandparents to fund that, so she could support herself and her family. Whether that expectation is entitled is a different conversation, but at no point does it sound like Amy just wanted grandparents to fund her lifestyle forever. It honestly sounds more like she wanted emotional support at a tough time, and this is one of the ways she can point to and say she didn't receive it.", "I think the shock came when his wife said that his parents should have paid for her education instead of his and there daughter.", "They got married not long after Ashley was born.\n\nI don\u2019t think she baby trapped Hugo. Despite some of her behaviour I\u2019ve never considered her that conniving", "Hey you might want to double-check that bit about loans getting cancelled at a certain age. This has changed and is now measured through the time since you took out loans (pg loan rules differ).", "Sorry, OP, you're being blind. Your grandparents have bought Ashley, you stood there while  this 11 year old disrespected her mom and did nothing. Amy has every right to seethe over a family that only sees her offspring and her (useless) spouse. and treats her like trash.", "I think once a person starts making adult decisions they need to be treated like an adult. It wasn\u2019t because he had a child. It was because he became a father and a husband. Who had his own HOUSEHOLD to support. At what point do parents stop being responsible for their kids expenses?! It\u2019s ridiculous to think you can go and establish and entire household and then expect your parents to still pay for you. And the parents decided at the end to gift him the cost of his student loans. You never know. They probably thought they were going to be throwing money down the drain trying to pay for his college and wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d ever finish. Furthermore, I\u2019m still not sure how them helping THEIR CHILD. Means they have to pay for their spouses child.\n\nAlso, they cut off THEIR son, they never cut off Amy as Amy was never their responsibility. So again, even if I follow your argument about them cutting off their son, Amy would still have had the same opportunity she had before.\n\nHahah, so basically, it\u2019s a come up to say you married into a rich family so now they should be supporting you..got it. I guess gold digging is a normal expectation in the Uk. Will keep that in mind.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 parents are extremely wealthy and prestigious (like diplomats) and it has never crossed my mind they would pay off my student loans. I don\u2019t even expect HIM to pay off my student loans. The topic literally never comes up. \n\nI guess we all have our own standards that we live by.", "No, it is completely unreasonable to expect your in-laws to fund your education.  That's absurd."]}
