I received some really great advice and some amazingly kind messages, so thank you again! I am getting a lot of update requests, so here it is.\n\nTo get this out of the way for everyone who wants a quick update, Ashley did end up coming on the ski trip. We had a great time, me especially as my engagement ring arrived and me and my bf are now officially engaged.\n\nA lot of people suggested we all sit down to discuss what's been going on, and we did. Ashley managed to say a lot of what she'd been saying to me to Amy. The conversation boiled down to, Ashley doesn't want an absent mother, but she wants a mother, not a friend. She wants a mum who drives her to ice skating with her friends, and sits in the stands to supervise, not one who comes onto the ice with them and tries to hang out. She says she does sometimes feel awkward at school, but she manages it most of the time, until her mum is around and then she is reminded that she's different. A lot more was said, but this was the main gist.\n\nAs for Amy, it turns out she has a lot of resentment towards our family, and even towards Ashley. She feels it's not fair that me and my parents focused so much on supporting Ashley rather than supporting Amy. She said instead of funding Ashley's education, my parents should have offered to pay for her to attend university after Ashley was born, or they should have done this instead of clearing Hugo's student loan debt. She said us caring about Ashley should have made us like her more but we all ignored her in favour of her baby, and now even her kid was abandoning her. I won't comment on this other than to say we were all shocked by what she said. \n\nThe outcome of the conversation was that Hugo and Amy decided never to tell Ashley that they almost didn't let her go on the ski trip. Ashley will start seeing a therapist to talk about what's been going on with her at home and at school, and bring her mother into some sessions if necessary. My parents have offered to fund it if it's not feasible for her parents to pay, but they're looking into it. \n\nAshley said Amy has been giving her a lot more space since she got home, and Hugo has been spending more time with her, and might start taking riding lessons with her (he played polo as a teen) for them to bond more doing something Ashley loves. Overall she seems a lot happier. Unfortunately, the things Amy said about our family have caused some issues between her and Hugo. Everyone is hoping they can work through it.\n\nSo, sort of an open ended update, but I'm really glad Ashley finally got to have the conversation she needed, and that she seems to be doing so well, because really that is all I've ever been hoping for. \n\nThank you again to everyone who took the time to comment!", "created_utc": 1673173207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106fwz5/update_my_brother_and_sil_asked_me_to_lie_to_my/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Thank you very much for the update. I am glad you could talk it out. \nEven though you don't want to go into detail about how Amy felt after Ashley was born, I think it is important. Amy's own life was on pause having a child so early, she doesn't have a career to go back to after Ashley grew up.\nI feel like she should have asked for support but I can see where she comes from.", "I am happy to read that Ashley got to have a real conversation and can focus on the future with help.\n\nI must say, that I am not surprised Amy feels this way. She was still a teenager after all, when she became a mom. And just because somebody is an adult according to the law. It doesn't make them an adult emotionally (nor brain wise, it is still developing at that age after all). Amy will need help as well, and I do mean therapy. I hope when Hugo and Amy figure that out, you all will be willing to help as well. Ashley deserves a healthy mother, with whom she can have a real healthy relationship with.", "Amy also needs to go to therapy. Because wow. The sense of entitlement here is overpowering wow. To expect your family to fund HER education and being jealous of her own daughter is verrrrryyyy, for the lack of a better word, disturbing. Yikes.", "That sounds like real progress.", "Wow Amy just sounds like the worst. \"I got knocked up young so your family should have paid for me to go to uni\"?", "Amy sounds unhinged why should your parents have payed for her education rather than there granchilds, it's clear she's jealous of her daughter which is disturbing and I think she should be the one therapy not the poor kid. To tell her daughter that she has resentment against her own daughter wow just wow", "Thanks for the update!", "YTA, (didn\u2019t read the post was too long)", "Amy bat shit crazy if she thinks the grandparents should fund her education instead of their grandchild.", "Amy is a bit of nut... she wanted her in laws to pay for her college?? In what world does she live", "I'm sorry but alot of woman have children young(me) I work may not be what I wanted to do but I do it cause it was my choice to have a child and I didn't expect anyone else to provide for me or my son for anything especially an education. She could of easily of got off her butt and get a job and go back to school 1000's of ppl do it every day. She shouldn't of told her daughter the things she did it's disgusting and she's sounds very entitled to expect everyone to be there for her and not her daughter", "Really sad if you think about it. Amy clearly was only an adult by law. She was not emotionally an adult and one could question if she was ready to be a mom. It is clear she never worked through those emotions and they turned into some very dark and ugly resentment. She needs help. And for Ashley's sake, I hope they all figure that out. Ashley does deserve a healthy relationship with her own mom after all.", "Seriously.  And if you did you\u2019d realize how fucking pompous and first world the OP is.  Ohhh Hugo played polo as a teen\u2026shut the fuck up", "I think Amy needs a therapist more than Ashley does. She's upset at the wrong people over her situation.", "I really feel sorry for Amy. She is in a no-one win situation. Even here, so much hate toward Amy. Guess there's a lot of people walking on water here. Why didn't anyone in family offer to help Amy?", "Marrying into a rich family does not entitle you to those peoples money.  And before somebody hit me with the \u201cthey should want to give her that money\u201c response.  She has a whole husband, if she wants to go to school, then her and her husband should get together and figure out how to make that happen.  It\u2019s possible that if Hugo and Amy were making efforts in that direction the in-laws might see it and decide to help out but if they don\u2019t it still doesn\u2019t make them bad people.  I\u2018m more interested in Amy and Ashley improving their relationship.", "Congratulations on your engagement. And thanks for updating.", "Keep up the good work. At this rate Amy should be out of the picture in no time then you can swoop in steal her kid like you clearly want to.", "Lots to un pick here but a stand out to me is that Amy got pregnant by the son of a rich family and imagined that made her rich too. She expected to be living the lifestyle her daughter actually is and resents everyone for that not being the case. Chuck in some emotional immaturity and boredom and you have this. NTA still though your brother has some work to do.", "Congratulations on the engagement and thanks for the update!!\n\nI worry about Amy not getting therapy in this. I understand her comments about the family are... less than savory but I hope Hugo recognizes some key things that need to happen in his house for it not to burn down. \n\nShe needs something to actually fulfill her as a person. A career would probably do wonders for her because it sounds like she feels real isolated. \n\nSuper glad Ashley was able to clear some things up and communicate with her parents about boundaries.", "ESH\n\nLook at it from Amy's POV: rich kid Hugo (polo-playing!) knocked her up, derailed her education/job/life plans, got cut off by his AH parents (bc he didn't ditch not-so-rich Amy?), so she ended up isolated and short of money while he got his education keeping his future job opps open.\n\nHere she is 11 years later, Hugo's doing ok and reconciled with his parents, her daughter is at a swanky school paid for by said grandparents, but she (Amy) doesn't have the clothes/money/job/education to fit in with the other mothers. \n\nDo OP/Hugo's parents treat her like a gold-digger that 'trapped' their precious son? OP's developed a great relationship with Ashley but doesn't get on particularly well with Amy. I'm not saying she's perfect but she seems to me to be a lonely fish-out-of-water SAHM that no-one seems to have any sympathy for and nobody really tries to include. Her daughter is embarrassed by her, her husband doesn't seem to really see any problems, and the only one giving her love is the 4-yr-old.\n\nIf there's spare cash, I would hope Amy has a good hard think about getting some training/education, then a part-time job, till her son's old enough for her to go to full-time. Then if this - at best oblivious, at worst alienating - family dumps Amy out in the cold, she has some skills to start again.", "I feel for Amy. She had a baby as a teen (her age is never mentioned, which I find off), seems she got cut out of her own family as well as her partners' during a difficult time in her life, and threw herself into trying to be a great mum. Now Ashley is growing up and being, honestly, a cruel and self centred brat. OP's family obviously is financially able to help out with education, because they pay for their granddaughter, and they paid off their son's loans (after I assume they reconciled). But Amy's just left on her own? What support did she get as a teen mother? Sounds like she didn't get a chance for education or life experiences. She made a lot of sacrifices to have Ashley, and is just generally being dismissed/unvalued. \n\nI think Amy feels she got trapped by circumstances and doesn't even have the reward of being valued by her own daughter. I don't think it's entitled or unhinged of her to be resentful of her current situation. I think she could definitely benefit from therapy to process the emotions she's probably been repressing all these years.\n\nMight help if the family generally treated her like family. Because from OP's post, I get the sense that they probably don't do that.", "Thank you for the update.   I was wondering how it turned out.   Wow.  That is a lot to unpack.  There is a lot of built-up resentment and entitlement there, though.   If she wanted to go back to school, why didn't she go when your niece was younger?  Why did she expect your parents to fund HER education?   Did she ask for help or just expect it and then sit there getting mad because they didn't jump in to like she wanted them to?  I'm glad you guys sat down and talked about it, but wow.   Hopefully, everyone keeps working on it all.   And congrats on your engagement!", "It's kinda sad that Amy spills her guts about how she feels less than compared to Ashley and that side of the family *and* she identifies the parents funding things for Ashley as a source of hurt and then the response is for the parents to fund therapy only for Ashley when Amy is clearly in desperate need of therapy too. \n\nI get that Amy isn't their blood and she isn't entitled to their money for uni or anything else, but man that has to sting.", "If there's spare cash, I would hope Amy has a good hard think about getting some training/education, then a part-time job", "Why she is grown up.\n\nShe chose to have a child and do nothing for herself.\n\nIf she wants her life to change she needs to change it her self.\n\nWhat has been doing for the last 11 years.\n\nI get that the first fee years she was looking after Ashley but when Ashley started School, why didn't Amy start doing something for herself during those hours Ashley was at school.   \n\nIf she really wanted go back to school then she should talked to her husband and made a plan with him.    \n\nLots of women are raising and getting an education and working.", "Well maybe Hugo and Amy should be paying for Ashley's education instead of the in laws. Perhaps what they are doing with their money contributes to how Amy feels.", "Thank you :)", "Nobody treats Amy like she trapped Hugo, no one even thinks that happened. Hugo is a grown man, he wasn't trapped into making his own decisions. He was cut off by our parents because they didn't think they should be subsidising the life of a husband and father, they cut me off eventually too. \n\nAmy is not their child/grandchild, I'm not sure why she would expect them to pay for her education. Hugo is not entitled to have his further education paid for, that was a generous gift.", "She was 18 when she got pregnant, 19 when she had Ashley. What is off about that?", ">why should your parents have payed for her education rather than there granchilds\n\nWhy should they have paid for their child's education? Is that a serious question you're asking as if it's not something parents do for their children every day?", "People who downvoted... did your in laws paid for your education?", "And her husband.. why would she rather them pay for her school than his debts? If those debts they would have had to pay are cleared, they logically can take out more loans for her to go to school now.", "I did not mean to defend her but I can understand why she may feel like everybody's life goes on and she is left out. Her child grows up, her family has a job and she is in the same place she was before getting pregnant. It is not up to the family or anyone else to do something against it but maybe they can understand how she feels and offer her support if they wish.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like they can afford to pay for it.  But they are her parents and they are well within their rights to refuse the money.", "Where are Amy's Parents in all this ?\n\nDoes she have any family ?\n\nDoes Amy have a Job ?\n\nWhat is Amy's life like exactly ?", ">*Nobody treats Amy like she trapped Hugo, no one even thinks that happened*\n\nGood, glad to hear it. \n\n*not sure why she would expect them to pay for her education*\n\nDidn't say that; I meant, if there's now any spare money in Hugo/Amy household budget, she should go get training/education. She'd end up less isolated, with some outside friends/contacts, plus skills to take forward.", "It was a piece of missing information that seemed suspicious. Also good job disregarding 99% of my comment.", "I think you have them mixed up.  Amy is the daughter in law, not their daughter.  Ashley is their grand child.", "She still has her 4yo little boy to handle yet so I really do hope she gets help before she does the exact same thing to him. I think maybe trying to get a part time job while the kids are at school could help but I think now she's been home that long I don't think she would want to work. I think she may of gotten use it cause if she really wanted a job or a career she could of when Ashley was younger and then done some online classes. I think she's a very entitled person towards op family, like she thinks they owe her cause she gave them Ashley at a young age.", "Amy has an on/off relationship with her mum, sometimes they're close, then they fight and don't talk for months. I think she's only seen her dad sporadically throughout her life.\n\nAmy doesn't work, no. I think she had a short lived part time job right before she got pregnant with my nephew.\n\nOn a day to day basis, I don't know what her life is like. I live abroad, and I see her every couple of months when at my parents' or when I'm picking Ashley up/dropping her off. I imagine being a SAHM to two kids is exhausting, she dedicates herself to her family, but I don't know what her timetable is or anything like that.", "I just answered the question that I could. I don't know what support Amy received, I was 17 when she got pregnant. I also don't know what kind of relationship she had with her own mother at that time, so I really don't know if her mother was there for her physically or emotionally. I know when Ashley was young Amy didn't socialise much because she lost a lot of friends after dropping out, but that's really all I know about that time.", "Thank you for this information.", "You're literally only one year younger than her. Is that meant to be an explanation for why you've seemingly got zero relationship or interest in your sister in law? You don't know if she had support? You don't know if she talks to her mum? You don't know if your parents helped her out? Couldn't send her a friend request on FB and ask how she's doing? It's been eleven years. Never had a conversation with the woman?", "I know she has a on/off relationship with her mum now, so I don't know if they were on/off then. My parents bought a lot of baby stuff (cot, toys, pram, etc) for them. Hugo and Amy brought Ashley over every weekend when she was a baby and my parents babysat her when Hugo was going through exam periods at university while she was very young. \n\nI've obviously had conversations with Amy, but not long or deep ones because Amy doesn't like me, hasn't seen we were teenagers. She does things like call me a hooker at dinner parties. She's Ashley's mother, so I don't fight with her and I don't ever say anything bad about her, but she quite clearly does not want to be my friend. Which is her prerogative."]}
