Her explanation that she was just storing the tray in the trash but then asked you to take out the trash makes no earthly sense. You should keep an eye out for other signs of cognitive decline, like not being able to read menus (\"you know what I like, just order something for me\") and signs, acting like she's never heard a familiar word before, or storing other things in the wrong place. Also, look for signs her temper is rising and she's quick to become angry in uncharacteristic ways. See if over time you can convince her to try to see a memory specialist or neurologist if these oddities keep happening.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA.\n\nMom is being ridiculous.

Are you inclined to call the equivalent of child protective services?", "NTA. No sane person would assume it was still needed and dig it out of the trash. And you don't put something into the trash temporarily, you put it anywhere else but trash. I get messy, I get that things get dirty and maintaining the house clean when you're looking after a child is very hard but this is straight up being filthy.
