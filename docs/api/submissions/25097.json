We decided to order a chocolate layer cake from a bakery for the party and I asked my coworker John (M58) to order the cake, which he did. We all agreed to split the money for the cake and the other food as well. Two days ago I, John and our coworker Carter (M20) went to pick up the cake and buy some drinks and snacks for the upcoming party. When we arrived at the bakery, we got a strawberry cheesecake instead of a chocolate cake. I was confused and John admitted that he ordered a cheesecake, because he thought a cheesecake was a better option, due to the hot weather. This annoyed me, but since it was too late to order a new cake, we paid for the cake and left. \n\nOutside of the bakery Carter called out John for purposely ordering the wrong cake behind our backs and that it was infuriating, because everyone at work agreed to get a chocolate cake. He also demanded his money back, since he didn\u02bct agree to pay for a \u201cnasty cheesecake\u201d\nJohn told Carter to get over it and that cheesecake tastes good. Carter kept asking why he ordered the wrong cake and that he should have told us this before so we could get another cake. John got angry and screamed at Carter to let it go and that it\u02bcs not a big deal. Carter got angry too, opened the box with the cake in it and threw it on the ground for screaming at him. I was sick of this childish behavior, so I just walked to my car and left without them.\n\nSince we didn\u02bct have a cake anymore, I bought a baking mix and baked brownies instead. Not as good as a professionally made cake, but they were still tasty. When I brought the brownies to the party yesterday, my coworkers and our boss thankfully enjoyed them too. I told John and Carter that they won\u02bct get any, since they were acting childish and almost ruined the party. John said I was being unfair and said that he shouldn\u02bct get excluded, because Carter threw the cake, but I didn\u2019t care and just handed out the brownies to my other coworkers. Was I being unfair/an asshole for not giving him brownies?", "created_utc": 1692540437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wcczq/aita_for_not_sharing_brownies_with_my_coworkers/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All around. \n\nBottom line - no one cares it it is cake or cheesecake.  \n\nAnd the goal was a pleasant gathering for the leaving employees and your pettiness overlapped into the event - people just want to do their jobs and go home and not deal with all this weird garbage you are bringing to your workplace.", "The question here to me is what was your goal? Showing your colleagues that they were wrong with their whole drama and quarrel between them and therefor punishing them for it? Then you achieved what you aimed for. \n\nOr should the goal have been to make this a memorable event for the other two colleagues who are leaving? Serving a cake they\u2019d like (I assume)?\nIn that case no, you did not achieve your goal. \n\nIf it was me in your shoes I\u2019d think you could have shone had you just stood up and showed everyone that you\u2019re not giving into that quarrel but instead make this about them (your colleagues who are leaving) and not about the other two or showing your \u201cholier than though\u201d attitude.
