{"id": 24221, "submission_id": "15m1ug3", "title": "AITA for not telling my roommate I own the house?", "selftext": "Brief backstory: About a year ago my last remaining grandparent passed away and my father inherited all assets, including a house. I had been saving for a nice down payment (at least 50%) so I could have a lower mortgage payment each month, thus allowing me to save money for travel. When my father inherited this house, which he had no interest in moving into yet, he offered to sell it to me for slightly below market rate, with the caveat that he and my stepmother could eventually move into the basement apartment. I agreed, because they're both incredible people who are not at all invasive and would give me my privacy if they lived there. So I paid a 60% down payment, financed the rest, and moved in. \n\nPresent day: About six months ago I started considering renting out the finished basement apartment. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a small kitchenette (sink, fridge, microwave, but no oven). A friend of mine said his brother was moving to my city and needed a place. He's a brand new teacher and doesn't make great money, so he needed a place that wasn't expensive. I offered to let him rent my basement for way less than market rate ($650) which would include utilities. He readily accepted and signed a year long lease.\n\nWell a few days ago he asked if he could start paying the landlord directly instead of giving me rent money each month. I was under the impression my friend had told him I own the house, so I was confused and I told him we don't have a landlord and that I'm the owner. He got very upset and screamed at me for \"lying for over six months\" and \"taking advantage of him\" by making him pay so much in rent. For the record, an apartment similar to the one in my house would be well over twice what he's paying me, closer to three times for something as nice. He asked how much of my mortgage he's covering and I said \"Why does that matter? You're getting a nice, quiet place to live, access to a full kitchen and laundry room, and you're paying an amount that you can afford. My personal finances aren't really a factor here.\" He stormed out of the room and slammed the basement door. He's still not speaking to me.\n\nI asked a few other friends and some family members, and most said I'm wrong for having him cover my mortgage payments. Only a few say I'm in the right. So AITA for having my roommate cover $650 of my $775/month mortgage?\n\nETA: He has a lease so I won't be evicting him over this alone. If he does any damage or becomes hostile, I'll look at the eviction process. But for now, he will remain unless he chooses to break the lease (which I'd allow him to do if he wants). \n\n\nHe also didn\u2019t bother to read the lease before signing. The lease clearly states I\u2019m the homeowner. I didn\u2019t trick him or keep info from him. He simply didn\u2019t read what he was signing.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t get the house for almost free as some people choose to believe. My father sold it to me for about 75% of its value, more or less as an advance on \u201crent\u201d he and my stepmother will pay when they move in here in a few years. We already agreed they won\u2019t pay monthly rent but will contribute to utilities and groceries at that time. I also made a 60% down payment so I have quite a bit invested, as well at paying about $1500/month out of pocket for taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, etc.", "created_utc": 1691546957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15m1ug3/aita_for_not_telling_my_roommate_i_own_the_house/", "score": 19043, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Second, you clearly thought your friend told him you owned the house, I mean why else would he give you his rent? Third, your friends need to learn how renting works.

Come to think of it didn\u2019t you also sign the lease as the landlord?\nEdit to add judgement NTA", "NTA", "Its none of his business and owning a house is a lot more than a mortgage and has nothing to do with market rate on a rental.    \n\n\nIf I pay of my house and choose to rent it would I offer it to free? No\n\nIs he going to pay half if the HVAC goes out or if you have a busted pipe , replacing old appliances.\n\nHe's coming from a spot of inexperience with being an adult and paying for adult stuff\n\nI would tell him that you understand he is upset and you are happy to let him out of the lease so he can find a place where he feels more comfortable.  But if he chooses to stay he better have your rent come next due date with a smile.\n\nNext time rent to strangers - never friends or friends of friends or family", "NTA.

That's a sweet setup. I'd easily pay to have that. 2 bedrooms, 1 for sleeping and the other for hobbies and/or extra storage.

The owner eventually decided to sell the place, so i moved back home", "He is renting a cheap space and it\u2019s none of his business what you use the money for.

The house will be paid off one day. Would you be ripping someone off to charge rent?", "He is not your roommate. He is your tenant and you owe him no explanation. If you didn\u2019t have a mortgage would that mean he is entitled to live for free? One\u2019s mortgage has no bearing on what you SHOULD charge for rent. Market factors and personal preference guide this. You also didn\u2019t need to disclose anything. NTA", "NTA, you can own the house outright and rent rooms for a profit. Let him know he\u2019s free to break the lease and look for a cheaper place.", "NTA\n\nWhat is wrong with your family and friends?  Are you supposed to let someone live rent-free in your place? Even if it were for your friend instead of for his brother this would be an extremely entitled attitude.  And you are even offering at roughly half market rate.  After the lease is up let him go find another place.  Raise rent up to near market levels for any new lease since he has decided unilaterally that you are ripping him off. I'd consider cheap rent a favor in itself if I were in his shoes.", "NTA, it\u2019s irrelevant that you own it. It\u2019s a roommate lease. Not a friendship issue.", "NTA. Ask them what their problem is. You were planning on renting it out. You found someone to rent it to and you gave a lowered rent because it was through a friend. The renting was always going to happen. So why not to an acquaintance at a lowered rent as opposed to a stranger for a market rate? Where is the difference in this other than they get a deal? \"Am I not allowed to rent it out? Because I own it? What are you trying to say here?\" Frankly, it sounds like they're just salty you have the option and they don't. So it's better to villainize you as 'a greedy landlord' instead of just a poor tenant. \n\nConversely, you can also invite this person to go look at rental rates in the surrounding area and come back to you when he finds anything lower than what you're offering.", "I don't understand how anyone thinks you are in the wrong here. Does this person expect to live in your house for free? What am I missing? \n\nNTA.", "NTA - Give him a month to find a better arrangement... bet he stays.", "NTA. Talk to your friend about their brother's behaviour. \n\nAlso you're a landlord and they are your tenant. You are not roommates. This is important to remember because your rights and responsibilities are very different than if you're roommates.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. It\u2019s not your fault of the renter failed to his due diligence over who he was paying rent to. Also, you are allowed to make a reasonable profit on the space you are renting. You are renting the space at below market rates, which is what should matter to him, not how much of your mortgage his rent makes up. \n\nYou were 100% correct that your personal finances aren\u2019t his business.", "NTA. He's already getting 50% off the market rate. Your huge deposit is why your mortgage is so low and isn't any of his business. You aren't obligated to subsidize his housing any more than you already are.", "He is a manipulator and a bully. Recognize he has no intention of being honest or fair or civil from now on.", "You\u2019re kinda TA, if you\u2019re renting from your home it shouldn\u2019t be more than half your mortgage. If someone had a high paying corp job sure fine, but to a teacher? It\u2019s your life and choice but it\u2019s a real dick move. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night if it were me. You can do what you want but I think you kinda suck for that.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s paying well below market rate and the amount you\u2019re \u201cpaying in rent\u201d shouldn\u2019t impact this as it\u2019s your house. Would he expect to live there for free if you had already paid off the house and had no monthly payment?", "NTA, why does it matter if his rent is covering your mortgage? His rent would probably be covering the mortgage of a different landlord as well. Using that logic to get mad at you is dumb. He should be grateful you are giving him a deal. You could be fully covering your mortgage and have extra money on top of that if you did market value instead of the deal you are giving him.", "NTA\n\nTell the freeloader they can look for another rental. It is totally irrelevant who owns the property. They signed a lease and it\u2019s a binding legal document. If they don\u2019t like the terms, they can opt to not renew. I\u2019d also look into eviction requirements. There may be future shenanigans. \n\nNo good deed goes unpunished.", "Kick him out", "Nta but why did he even want to pay the landlord directly?", "NTA. Why shouldn't you make money from renting the apartment? Your friend knew you were the owner. More importantly, you weren't going to let him live there for free. That dude is a drama king IMO", "NTA - not your fault he didn't realise you were the owner/landlord, I'm assuming your name was the landlord on the lease agreement.  You're also NTA for having him pay rent no matter how much of your mortgage it covers, he's got a very decent apartment at a reasonable rent.", "Nta, what would have been the difference if there was a landlord and he was paying off their mortgage instead? Is he upset because you have a house and he\u2019s just starting his career? His reaction doesn\u2019t make sense.", "NTA", "NTA.  Whether his rent is more or less than your mortgage should be of no consequence to him. He agreed to the rate and signed a lease and that's all that matters. It would be no different if the renter was your sibling", "NTA - why are ppl looking at it as if he\u2019s paying your mortgage directly. What it is, is you\u2019re the landlord and he\u2019s paying you his rent, and where that money goes is no body\u2019s business but the landlords. If the money doesn\u2019t go into the mortgage where should it go? Back into his own pocket? He\u2019s a renter so he has to pay rent, anyone trying to argue their way out of paying rent is just delusional.", "OMG are they freaking serious?! What is they think people do when they rent? They cover the landlord's mortgage payment!\n\nYou are definitely NTA and quite honestly, do not renew the lease with this person. How entitled can one person be? I rented an Airbnb for a few months when I was new to the area. More precisely, I rented a bedroom. Yes, I had access to the kitchen, shared bathroom with whoever else were guests, shared laundry room, and pool, but still...bedroom, for more than you're charging for a finished basement apartment. It sounds like your renter is going to get sticker shock when he moves out.\n\nTell everyone who thinks you're ripping the guy off to check the market rate for the area then go kick rocks. Were you supposed to let him stay for free?!\n\nAgain, NTA but I think I'd start looking for smarter friends.", "Hard NTA. Never thought I'd be siding with a landlord on Reddit, but you haven't done nothing wrong. Your tenant and your friends seem to be too focused on the mortgage part, do they think normal landlords don't have mortgages to pay as well?", "NTA and wtf? We're renting a house and didn't even think to ask our landlord how much they're paying in mortgage. Who the hell thinks rent depends on the owner's mortgage?", "if he is mad, let him out of the lease and get a new tenant and charge market rates", "NTA. Dude expects you to let him live there for $300 a month or something? Some people don\u2019t realize how good they have it.", "He would pay much more anywhere else. What difference does it make to him? I would invite him to leave if he doesn\u2019t like it. Your friends don\u2019t seem to get it either.", "NTA...As a former realtor, that's how most rental property investors get to continue investing. They eventually get to a point to where the property more than pays for itself. \n\nI'm more concerned that this person seems entitled and has a temper, and HE'S A TEACHER. If your friends are around the same age as you and don't own property or know any investors, they don't have enough life experience to judge your actions on this matter. I'm certain, if put in the same position, most would agree with you.", "NTA,Sounds like he's got issues with the wonders of capitalism and ownership.None of your finances are his biz and he's way out of line", "No. NTA at all. He is renting a space in your house. It\u2019s the same as if he was renting from a faceless mystery landlord. Of course he\u2019s covering part of your mortgage. What does he think happens with any rent he has ever paid? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what percentage he\u2019s paying and you don\u2019t need to say anything about that. It\u2019s none of his business. He\u2019s getting a much lower than average rent for the area. That\u2019s all that matters. Tell him you will let him out of his lease if he\u2019s that unhappy about it but if he wants to stay he needs to get over it.", "NTA It sounds to me like he either thought that you were a renter who was trying to sublet part of the house to cover your bills or something else hinky was going on and he was calling your bluff by asking about the landlord. He was caught out when you told him the truth and threw that bit about paying your mortgage out there before thinking things through. He probably realizes how stupid that was and is keeping his head down.", "NTA. But you should have been clear in the lease signing process that you are the live-in landlord. Can't assume anything in legal situations", "NTA and I have no idea why he would react in such a dramatic way. A good deal is a good deal. I don't know why who he pays rent to matters.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re renting out the downstairs apartment to him a a super low rental price, how is it you\u2019re taking advantage? And who gives a shit whose mortgage it pays? \n\nPfft! Offer to let him go since it\u2019s such a big deal. He can find a place to rent elsewhere.", "NTA. I dont understand why there r other ppl who said to u that he shldnt cover your mortgage. N he isnt even covering the full mortgage also. So what did they expect u to do? Let him live there for free?? Wtf.", "NTA - your family and friends are completely wrong. So, are they saying that if the same landlord buys two identical houses next to each other and one has a $1000 payment and one has a $10,000 payment he should rent one for $500 and the other one for $5000 regardless of what market rents are? That is just silly. When you rent out property you own it is a business activity and you will also have future expenses. You are supposed to make a profit, otherwise why would you do it?", "NTA - the whole purpose of renting is to cover your mortgage!", "NTA. It has nothing to do with how much your mortgage is. (If your mortgage was $0, would he expect to stay there for free?) What matters is the market rate, and are there even any places in the US where you can find a safe, clean 2-br apartment for $650?", "NTA.

How much you have financed is irrelevant.", "Wow what an ungrateful asshole. The roommate. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s paying your mortgage. Rent is rent regardless of who it goes to. He\u2019s getting a below market price. Why he thinks you owe him any favors is beyond me. He\u2019s not your friend or relative. Even if he were he\u2019s still getting a deal. People who think you\u2019re an asshole can rent to him at a lower rate then.", "Utilities are included! That is a steal! \n\nNTA \n\nAnd why was he wanting to pay the landlord directly?

Either your friend is unbalanced it there is way more to this story.", "NTA. He\u2019s gonna say something like well you should lower it so we are both paying half. But here\u2019s the difference.

What are you supposed to do in his mind, give it to him rent free?  Um, big NO.", "Nta....does he think he's not paying the owners mortgage if he's renting an apartment in a building or renting a house? He's getting really cheap rent. He should be happy. Even in the small town I live in where houses and apartments are on the cheaper side of most places in this country $650 isn't going to get you much. MAYBE a tiny one bedroom of a shitty apartment and it won't include electric and stuff. He sounds like an entitled ass. If he brings it up again tell him if he finds something cheaper then he's welcome to leave. He's forgetting, that may be moat of your mortgage payment, but you're also covering electric, water, trash, I'm assuming WiFi /cable. So in reality he's NOT covering most of it.

I had been saving for a nice down payment (at least 50%) so I could have a lower mortgage payment each month, thus allowing me to save money for travel. When my father inherited this house, which he had no interest in moving into yet, he offered to sell it to me for well below market rate, with the caveat that he and my stepmother could eventually move into the basement apartment. I agreed, because they're both incredible people who are not at all invasive and would give me my privacy if they lived there. So he sold it to me and I moved in.\n\nPresent day: About six months ago I started considering renting out the finished basement apartment. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a small kitchenette (sink, fridge, microwave, but no oven). A friend of mine said his brother was moving to my city and needed a place. He's a brand new teacher and doesn't make great money, so he needed a place that wasn't expensive. I offered to let him rent my basement for way less than market rate ($650) which would include utilities. He readily accepted and signed a year long lease. \n\nWell a few days ago he asked if he could start paying the landlord directly instead of giving me rent money each month. I was under the impression my friend had told him I own the house, so I was confused and I told him we don't have a landlord and that I'm the owner. He got very upset and screamed at me for \"lying for over six months\" and \"taking advantage of him\" by making him pay so much in rent. For the record, an apartment similar to the one in my house would be well over twice what he's paying me, closer to three times for something as nice. He asked how much of my mortgage he's covering and I said \"Why does that matter? You're getting a nice, quiet place to live, access to a full kitchen and laundry room, and you're paying an amount that you can afford. My personal finances aren't really a factor here.\" He stormed out of the room and slammed the basement door. He's still not speaking to me. \n\nI asked a few other friends and some family members, and most said I'm wrong for having him cover my mortgage payments. Only a few say I'm in the right. So AITA for having my roommate cover $650 of my $775/month mortgage? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Personally, I don't understand the problem and him being mad about it sounds stupid. He's a renter.

Renters seem to have this idea that the mortgage payment is what housing coasts, period. If they were paying all of that, plus the mortgage, rents would be way higher in the situation OP is describing. \n\nAlso, not everyone wants to own a house, or is capable of doing so. If you aren\u2019t sure where you want to live, or you don\u2019t want the responsibility for upkeep & repairs, or you\u2019re not planning to stay where you are working\u2026then buying a house isn\u2019t going to be a good option. When you own, you can\u2019t just up and move. \n\nI hate the current situation of housing shortage making it expensive & difficult to find a place to live. But that situation is NOT being caused by landlords like OP. People like to rag on landlords, but they don\u2019t go after, for example, the mega-rich foreigners or the private equity companies that are currently buying up massive numbers of not just apartment complexes, but formerly private foreclosed-on homes, all over the country, and turning them into overpriced rentals that will never come on the market again for occupant ownership. \n\nInstead, they pick on someone like the OP, who is simply trying to make sure he can provide for his parents in future when they need him, and have something to show for his years of work maintaining the property, and who, while doing so, is keeping a living unit available for someone at less than market rate.\n\nYeah, we need a solution to the housing crisis, but people who think there is a magic solution where nobody has to be paid for building and maintaining actual homes, are naive and don\u2019t understand reality. Why on earth they think someone like OP owes it to them to take on 100% of the responsibility and cost of providing housing for someone else is beyond me to understand.", "I have no idea.

He's either helping paying OPs mortgage, or another landlord's. That how rent works. He seems like he'd have no issues paying money to a corporation, why would he have issues paying OP.\n\nAlso, if OP was just giving out a free apartment to be nice, it would probably go to someone in a worse situation.", "That's interesting, I'd much prefer dealing with the owner directly. I guess the disconnect makes it easier for some people.", "I think its more about the owners protecting themselves, especially if they live on the same property. Obviously a lot of landlords are shitty as hell, but can you imagine being a nice one like OP or the lady using a management company mentioned above, and your neighbours/tenants know on your door and bitch to you about every single thing whenever they want regardless of it's level of important. Also from my side, I've preferred agents, they have more formal obligations as an actual business and service provider (at least the country where I live) which means they can't be as shady as scummy landlords when something needs to get done. Had an issue with our toilet and it was fixed the same week at no charge because it was shortly after we moved in which meant it was a prior issue and in no way our fault.", "The rent is also for upkeep of the house and property, and don\u2019t forget property taxes.
