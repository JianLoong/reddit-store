I had been saving for a nice down payment (at least 50%) so I could have a lower mortgage payment each month, thus allowing me to save money for travel. When my father inherited this house, which he had no interest in moving into yet, he offered to sell it to me for well below market rate, with the caveat that he and my stepmother could eventually move into the basement apartment. I agreed, because they're both incredible people who are not at all invasive and would give me my privacy if they lived there. So he sold it to me and I moved in.\n\nPresent day: About six months ago I started considering renting out the finished basement apartment. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a small kitchenette (sink, fridge, microwave, but no oven). A friend of mine said his brother was moving to my city and needed a place. He's a brand new teacher and doesn't make great money, so he needed a place that wasn't expensive. I offered to let him rent my basement for way less than market rate ($650) which would include utilities. He readily accepted and signed a year long lease.\n\nWell a few days ago he asked if he could start paying the landlord directly instead of giving me rent money each month. I was under the impression my friend had told him I own the house, so I was confused and I told him we don't have a landlord and that I'm the owner. He got very upset and screamed at me for \"lying for over six months\" and \"taking advantage of him\" by making him pay so much in rent. For the record, an apartment similar to the one in my house would be well over twice what he's paying me, closer to three times for something as nice. He asked how much of my mortgage he's covering and I said \"Why does that matter? You're getting a nice, quiet place to live, access to a full kitchen and laundry room, and you're paying an amount that you can afford. My personal finances aren't really a factor here.\" He stormed out of the room and slammed the basement door. He's still not speaking to me.\n\nI asked a few other friends and some family members, and most said I'm wrong for having him cover my mortgage payments. Only a few say I'm in the right. So AITA for having my roommate cover $650 of my $775/month mortgage?\n\nETA: He has a lease so I won't be evicting him over this alone. If he does any damage or becomes hostile, I'll look at the eviction process. But for now, he will remain unless he chooses to break the lease (which I'd allow him to do if he wants)", "created_utc": 1691546957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15m1ug3/aita_for_not_telling_my_roommate_i_own_the_house/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Second, you clearly thought your friend told him you owned the house, I mean why else would he give you his rent? Third, your friends need to learn how renting works. Of course the rent goes towards the owner\u2019s mortgage (most of the time anyway), and why does it matter if you use it to pay your mortgage or stick it in your travel fund? He\u2019s still paying the same every month.", "NTA\n\nIf he\u2019s so unhappy offer to break his lease and let him find another place to live.

You don\u2019t need that a-hole let his ungrateful a$$ find another place to live. You are NTA and actually nice for what you\u2019ve done.", "NTA. Also he's not paying that much off your mortgage. Utilities are coming out of that also.", "Why did he want to change the way payment was made? Was he looking to take over and get you out? Hahahaha. Come to think of it didn\u2019t you also sign the lease as the landlord?\nEdit to add judgement NTA", "NTA", "Its none of his business and owning a house is a lot more than a mortgage and has nothing to do with market rate on a rental.    \n\n\nIf I pay of my house and choose to rent it would I offer it to free? No\n\nIs he going to pay half if the HVAC goes out or if you have a busted pipe , replacing old appliances.\n\nHe's coming from a spot of inexperience with being an adult and paying for adult stuff\n\nI would tell him that you understand he is upset and you are happy to let him out of the lease so he can find a place where he feels more comfortable.  But if he chooses to stay he better have your rent come next due date with a smile.\n\nNext time rent to strangers - never friends or friends of friends or family", "NTA. He's paying a good price, doesn't matter how that factors into your finances (and just how does he think renting anywhere else works?). \n\nSounds like he's also forgetting that he's not paying for the home owners insurance or the utilities.", "NTA, $650/month plus utilities? That's a sweet setup. I'd easily pay to have that. 2 bedrooms, 1 for sleeping and the other for hobbies and/or extra storage. In fact, I had a similar setup 20 years where I was a caretaker of a 2bed, 1 bed condo. The owner eventually decided to sell the place, so i moved back home", "He is renting a cheap space and it\u2019s none of his business what you use the money for. It would be just as accurate to say that you use the rental income for expenses rather than mortgage. NTA but he is and he\u2019s treating you badly considering the discount he\u2019s enjoying", "Omg NTA at all. He assumed. And you\u2019re not taking advantage. You\u2019re charging him next to nothing.", "NTA\n\nDoesn't matter who owns the property he would still be paying rent.

The amount you\u2019re asking is more than fair for an apartment of that size. It doesn\u2019t matter what your mortgage payment is and you owe him no explanation.", "He\u2019s being ridiculous. The house will be paid off one day. Would you be ripping someone off to charge rent?", "He is not your roommate. He is your tenant and you owe him no explanation. If you didn\u2019t have a mortgage would that mean he is entitled to live for free? One\u2019s mortgage has no bearing on what you SHOULD charge for rent. Market factors and personal preference guide this. You also didn\u2019t need to disclose anything. NTA", "NTA, you can own the house outright and rent rooms for a profit. Let him know he\u2019s free to break the lease and look for a cheaper place.", "NTA\n\nWhat is wrong with your family and friends?  Are you supposed to let someone live rent-free in your place? Even if it were for your friend instead of for his brother this would be an extremely entitled attitude.  And you are even offering at roughly half market rate.  After the lease is up let him go find another place.  Raise rent up to near market levels for any new lease since he has decided unilaterally that you are ripping him off. I'd consider cheap rent a favor in itself if I were in his shoes.", "NTA, it\u2019s irrelevant that you own it. It\u2019s a roommate lease. Not a friendship issue.", "NTA. Ask them what their problem is. You were planning on renting it out. You found someone to rent it to and you gave a lowered rent because it was through a friend. The renting was always going to happen. So why not to an acquaintance at a lowered rent as opposed to a stranger for a market rate? Where is the difference in this other than they get a deal? \"Am I not allowed to rent it out? Because I own it? What are you trying to say here?\" Frankly, it sounds like they're just salty you have the option and they don't. So it's better to villainize you as 'a greedy landlord' instead of just a poor tenant. \n\nConversely, you can also invite this person to go look at rental rates in the surrounding area and come back to you when he finds anything lower than what you're offering.", "I don't understand how anyone thinks you are in the wrong here. Does this person expect to live in your house for free? What am I missing? \n\nNTA.", "NTA - Give him a month to find a better arrangement... bet he stays.", "NTA. Talk to your friend about their brother's behaviour. \n\nAlso you're a landlord and they are your tenant. You are not roommates. This is important to remember because your rights and responsibilities are very different than if you're roommates.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. It\u2019s not your fault of the renter failed to his due diligence over who he was paying rent to. Also, you are allowed to make a reasonable profit on the space you are renting. You are renting the space at below market rates, which is what should matter to him, not how much of your mortgage his rent makes up. \n\nYou were 100% correct that your personal finances aren\u2019t his business.", "NTA. He's already getting 50% off the market rate. Your huge deposit is why your mortgage is so low and isn't any of his business. You aren't obligated to subsidize his housing any more than you already are.", "He is a manipulator and a bully. Recognize he has no intention of being honest or fair or civil from now on.", "You\u2019re kinda TA, if you\u2019re renting from your home it shouldn\u2019t be more than half your mortgage. If someone had a high paying corp job sure fine, but to a teacher? It\u2019s your life and choice but it\u2019s a real dick move. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night if it were me. You can do what you want but I think you kinda suck for that.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s paying well below market rate and the amount you\u2019re \u201cpaying in rent\u201d shouldn\u2019t impact this as it\u2019s your house. Would he expect to live there for free if you had already paid off the house and had no monthly payment?", "NTA, why does it matter if his rent is covering your mortgage? His rent would probably be covering the mortgage of a different landlord as well. Using that logic to get mad at you is dumb. He should be grateful you are giving him a deal. You could be fully covering your mortgage and have extra money on top of that if you did market value instead of the deal you are giving him.", "NTA\n\nTell the freeloader they can look for another rental. It is totally irrelevant who owns the property. They signed a lease and it\u2019s a binding legal document. If they don\u2019t like the terms, they can opt to not renew. I\u2019d also look into eviction requirements. There may be future shenanigans. \n\nNo good deed goes unpunished.", "Kick him out", "Nta but why did he even want to pay the landlord directly?", "NTA. Why shouldn't you make money from renting the apartment? Your friend knew you were the owner. More importantly, you weren't going to let him live there for free. That dude is a drama king IMO", "NTA - not your fault he didn't realise you were the owner/landlord, I'm assuming your name was the landlord on the lease agreement.  You're also NTA for having him pay rent no matter how much of your mortgage it covers, he's got a very decent apartment at a reasonable rent.", "Nta, what would have been the difference if there was a landlord and he was paying off their mortgage instead? Is he upset because you have a house and he\u2019s just starting his career? His reaction doesn\u2019t make sense.", "NTA", "NTA.  Whether his rent is more or less than your mortgage should be of no consequence to him. He agreed to the rate and signed a lease and that's all that matters. It would be no different if the renter was your sibling", "NTA - why are ppl looking at it as if he\u2019s paying your mortgage directly. What it is, is you\u2019re the landlord and he\u2019s paying you his rent, and where that money goes is no body\u2019s business but the landlords. If the money doesn\u2019t go into the mortgage where should it go? Back into his own pocket? He\u2019s a renter so he has to pay rent, anyone trying to argue their way out of paying rent is just delusional.", "OMG are they freaking serious?! What is they think people do when they rent? They cover the landlord's mortgage payment!\n\nYou are definitely NTA and quite honestly, do not renew the lease with this person. How entitled can one person be? I rented an Airbnb for a few months when I was new to the area. More precisely, I rented a bedroom. Yes, I had access to the kitchen, shared bathroom with whoever else were guests, shared laundry room, and pool, but still...bedroom, for more than you're charging for a finished basement apartment. It sounds like your renter is going to get sticker shock when he moves out.\n\nTell everyone who thinks you're ripping the guy off to check the market rate for the area then go kick rocks. Were you supposed to let him stay for free?!\n\nAgain, NTA but I think I'd start looking for smarter friends.", "Hard NTA. Never thought I'd be siding with a landlord on Reddit, but you haven't done nothing wrong. Your tenant and your friends seem to be too focused on the mortgage part, do they think normal landlords don't have mortgages to pay as well?", "NTA and wtf? We're renting a house and didn't even think to ask our landlord how much they're paying in mortgage. Who the hell thinks rent depends on the owner's mortgage?", "if he is mad, let him out of the lease and get a new tenant and charge market rates", "NTA. Dude expects you to let him live there for $300 a month or something? Some people don\u2019t realize how good they have it.", "He would pay much more anywhere else. What difference does it make to him? I would invite him to leave if he doesn\u2019t like it. Your friends don\u2019t seem to get it either.", "NTA...As a former realtor, that's how most rental property investors get to continue investing. They eventually get to a point to where the property more than pays for itself. \n\nI'm more concerned that this person seems entitled and has a temper, and HE'S A TEACHER. If your friends are around the same age as you and don't own property or know any investors, they don't have enough life experience to judge your actions on this matter. I'm certain, if put in the same position, most would agree with you.", "NTA,Sounds like he's got issues with the wonders of capitalism and ownership.None of your finances are his biz and he's way out of line", "No. NTA at all. He is renting a space in your house. It\u2019s the same as if he was renting from a faceless mystery landlord. Of course he\u2019s covering part of your mortgage. What does he think happens with any rent he has ever paid? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what percentage he\u2019s paying and you don\u2019t need to say anything about that. It\u2019s none of his business. He\u2019s getting a much lower than average rent for the area. That\u2019s all that matters. Tell him you will let him out of his lease if he\u2019s that unhappy about it but if he wants to stay he needs to get over it.", "NTA It sounds to me like he either thought that you were a renter who was trying to sublet part of the house to cover your bills or something else hinky was going on and he was calling your bluff by asking about the landlord. He was caught out when you told him the truth and threw that bit about paying your mortgage out there before thinking things through. He probably realizes how stupid that was and is keeping his head down.", "NTA. But you should have been clear in the lease signing process that you are the live-in landlord. Can't assume anything in legal situations", "NTA and I have no idea why he would react in such a dramatic way. A good deal is a good deal. I don't know why who he pays rent to matters.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re renting out the downstairs apartment to him a a super low rental price, how is it you\u2019re taking advantage? And who gives a shit whose mortgage it pays? \n\nPfft! Offer to let him go since it\u2019s such a big deal. He can find a place to rent elsewhere.", "NTA. I dont understand why there r other ppl who said to u that he shldnt cover your mortgage. N he isnt even covering the full mortgage also. So what did they expect u to do? Let him live there for free?? Wtf.", "NTA - your family and friends are completely wrong. So, are they saying that if the same landlord buys two identical houses next to each other and one has a $1000 payment and one has a $10,000 payment he should rent one for $500 and the other one for $5000 regardless of what market rents are? That is just silly. When you rent out property you own it is a business activity and you will also have future expenses. You are supposed to make a profit, otherwise why would you do it?", "NTA - the whole purpose of renting is to cover your mortgage!", "NTA. It has nothing to do with how much your mortgage is. (If your mortgage was $0, would he expect to stay there for free?) What matters is the market rate, and are there even any places in the US where you can find a safe, clean 2-br apartment for $650?", "NTA. The guy sounds like he's really immature and inexperienced.", "NTA i would not let him renew that lease.", "You should be charging market rate for the unit. How much you have financed is irrelevant.", "Wow what an ungrateful asshole. The roommate. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s paying your mortgage. Rent is rent regardless of who it goes to. He\u2019s getting a below market price. Why he thinks you owe him any favors is beyond me. He\u2019s not your friend or relative. Even if he were he\u2019s still getting a deal. People who think you\u2019re an asshole can rent to him at a lower rate then.", "Utilities are included! That is a steal! \n\nNTA \n\nAnd why was he wanting to pay the landlord directly? There is something fishy. It might be that he was thinking of trying to kick you out.", "NTA-May want to let your friend know their brother is biting the hand that offered him a good deal.  They may give their brother a reality check about what is out there.", "Fuck no. Market value is the cost.", "Absolutely NTA.  Either your friend is unbalanced it there is way more to this story.", "NTA. He\u2019s gonna say something like well you should lower it so we are both paying half. But here\u2019s the difference. He\u2019s not a friend, he\u2019s a brother of a friend. And your not over charging him. Yea he probably could get away with less but ultimately if it\u2019s still cheaper than other places. Without a bunch of neighbors and headaches that come with an apartment. He can leave if he doesn\u2019t like it but tell him your not entertaining this conversation anymore", "NTA. Why is he ok with paying some mysterious \"landlord\", but not you as a landlord? Who did he think he was signing a lease with?", "Wow, the cojones on this one.   I'd give him notice; if he thinks he can find a better deal, let him. \n\n$650 for a two bedroom with utilities included??   I don't think you could get that good a deal in Oklahoma.", "NTA", "NTA - You are charging less than market rate, what difference is it to him if you own it or not.  It is not his business.  What are you supposed to do in his mind, give it to him rent free?  Um, big NO.", "Nta....does he think he's not paying the owners mortgage if he's renting an apartment in a building or renting a house? He's getting really cheap rent. He should be happy. Even in the small town I live in where houses and apartments are on the cheaper side of most places in this country $650 isn't going to get you much. MAYBE a tiny one bedroom of a shitty apartment and it won't include electric and stuff. He sounds like an entitled ass. If he brings it up again tell him if he finds something cheaper then he's welcome to leave. He's forgetting, that may be moat of your mortgage payment, but you're also covering electric, water, trash, I'm assuming WiFi /cable. So in reality he's NOT covering most of it. He's paying his share of the bills for things he's using.", "NTA as other comments have said, let him \u201cfind something better\u201d", "NTA kick him to the curb.  Find another tenant that will be grateful for the affordable rent", "NTA. You have every right to rent the basement apartment at full market rate, let alone at the deal you are giving him. Tell him that you are perfectly willing to let him out of his lease immediately if he is unhappy with the arrangement. You can then rent it out at $1000 a month. \n\nDo your friends think that if you had no mortgage that it would be only fair to let people live there for free?", "NTA. Set up an LLC and stop renting for so far under market value. Either way don\u2019t renew with him since he will surely find a better deal elsewhere.", "NTA-  your mortgage has nothing to do with his rent.", "Definitely NTA, who cares who the landlord is, he is getting a great deal on rent.

He knows he has a sweetheart deal, a 2 bedroom apartment for 650 and that includes utilities?  Anytime he wants to look around the market and find another apartment, he's welcome to it.  \n\nDoes he think if he had an apartment in a new building his rent wouldn't be helping cover the mortgage payment for that building?  If he doesn't, then he is very naive.  Let him act however he wants.  If he keeps up the attitude, don't renew his lease.  Make sure if you go that route, you provide him timely notification you won't be renewing the lease.", "NTA\n\nTell him you\u2019re happy to break the lease without penalty if he\u2019d prefer to live elsewhere.\n\nAnd advertise at market rate when the lease is up.", "NTA. it's absolutely *none of his business* how much of your mortgage he might be paying. he's made the deal based on the information/please presented to him, regardless of who owns the house or any other factors. \n\noffe4 to break the lease (or 2 months notice) for him if he thinks he can find somewhere comparable for the same amount or less! I'm sure you could easily get another renter in at that price.\n\nyeah, keep an eye on him. he's the AH. also.. don't become friends with him. keep it on a very business like basis.", "What a weird thing to get upset over. Why does it matter if he is paying towards your mortgage or some other person's mortgage? He's getting a great deal on rent and the bonus of a live in landlord in case there are maintenance issues.

Why would he be mad that you are the landlord? Don\u2019t tell him anything about your mortgage that\u2019s mot his business. And you don\u2019t owe him a decrease in rent based on your mortgage payments, Infact he owes you rent based on market value of the space he is renting.", "So by his logic, if you owned the house outright he shouldn't have to pay any rent because you dont have a mortage?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had been saving for a nice down payment (at least 50%) so I could have a lower mortgage payment each month, thus allowing me to save money for travel. When my father inherited this house, which he had no interest in moving into yet, he offered to sell it to me for well below market rate, with the caveat that he and my stepmother could eventually move into the basement apartment. I agreed, because they're both incredible people who are not at all invasive and would give me my privacy if they lived there. So he sold it to me and I moved in.\n\nPresent day: About six months ago I started considering renting out the finished basement apartment. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a small kitchenette (sink, fridge, microwave, but no oven). A friend of mine said his brother was moving to my city and needed a place. He's a brand new teacher and doesn't make great money, so he needed a place that wasn't expensive. I offered to let him rent my basement for way less than market rate ($650) which would include utilities. He readily accepted and signed a year long lease. \n\nWell a few days ago he asked if he could start paying the landlord directly instead of giving me rent money each month. I was under the impression my friend had told him I own the house, so I was confused and I told him we don't have a landlord and that I'm the owner. He got very upset and screamed at me for \"lying for over six months\" and \"taking advantage of him\" by making him pay so much in rent. For the record, an apartment similar to the one in my house would be well over twice what he's paying me, closer to three times for something as nice. He asked how much of my mortgage he's covering and I said \"Why does that matter? You're getting a nice, quiet place to live, access to a full kitchen and laundry room, and you're paying an amount that you can afford. My personal finances aren't really a factor here.\" He stormed out of the room and slammed the basement door. He's still not speaking to me. \n\nI asked a few other friends and some family members, and most said I'm wrong for having him cover my mortgage payments. Only a few say I'm in the right. So AITA for having my roommate cover $650 of my $775/month mortgage? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your financial situation is not his business.", "NTA - what does this guy think landlords do with rent money? Give it to charity?", "My name is on it. But he assumed it is because I was the primary and lived there before he moved in, thus making it a sublease. He\u2019s not very experienced in life yet and made a lot of assumptions.", "If he wants to break the lease, I\u2019d let him do it with no penalty. I could make at least $1000/month if I rented to a stranger. I mostly gave him the discount because he\u2019s my friend\u2019s brother, and teachers have a lot working against them so I thought he deserved a break. He teaches in a low income area and ends up spending money out of his own pocket to make sure his students have what they need.", "OP, this.  Do this.", "It\u2019s something about adding the payments to some online account so he has boost his credit score with rental payments. Or that\u2019s what his brother/my friend told me.", "The tenant sounds really ungrateful and entitled.\n\nI also wonder if he may also be jealous of OP? They are of similar ages but only one is a homeowner/landlord.", "He knows he couldn\u2019t afford even a shared room if I wasn\u2019t doing him a favor. The only reason he was able to accept a job in this city was because I offered deeply discounted rent.", "My family and friends think I should take it easy on him because he\u2019s a teacher and is doing a good thing for kids. But I thought I was taking it easy by giving him cheap rent.", "And I would raise the rent to 1,000 for his troubles.", "That's incredibly ridiculous. It's $650 all together including bills. For a two bedroom apartment. Where I'm from two bedrooms are upwards of $900-$1500 plus you pay your own bills except maybe water. The dude is getting a steal and where exactly do you think rent goes normally? Most landlords use it to cover mortgages, taxes, housing repairs, ECT. That's just common sense. \n\nI'm not sure where you got that if a landlord is renting from their home it should be half a mortgage but that's wrong. A landlord can charge whatever they wish, and he's charging way less than market value. The tenant, because he's not a roommate, doesn't have to live there. The tenant is free to break the lease any time, Op has already stated that. As it is, if the tenant decides to leave I guarantee you he will not find a better deal in which he has bills paid, has access to an in home washer and dryer, and doesn't have to deal with four neighbors on all sides. Plus, considering his utilities are included in that $650 that means his rent is maybe $200-300 a month and his utilities make it equal to $650 and holy shit that's a fantastic deal pretty much anywhere.", "It is $650. That is ridiculously low. I paid more than that for a tiny basement apartment 15 years ago. I have no idea how much my landlord\u2019s mortgage was and I didn\u2019t care.", "It's more than half the mortgage, but we don't know if it's more than half of the monthly costs to maintain the house - which is mortgage, insurance, taxes, electricity, water, heat, internet, repairs, etc. Since OP didn't provide a full accounting of household costs (and they shouldn't have to), for all we know it's less than half the total cost of the property every month.", "But it's all bills included. So dude isn't paying for the water, electric, Wi-Fi, or gas. I'd jump on 650 rent idgaf what my landlord does with it.", "100%. OP should tell him to look for something better. I would love to pay that price right now for housing.", "That was my thought too. In my mind the amount I paid for a down payment is my part of the \u201crent.\u201d Plus I am paying the rest of the mortgage along with providing amenities he would have to pay for elsewhere. But my friends and family think I should be splitting the mortgage equally so he\u2019s not paying more, so that had me questioning myself.", "I\u2019m only friends with his brother. And he thinks he\u2019s an absolute moron for being mad over cheap rent. He came over here yesterday and basically told his brother what an idiot he is, which made me laugh since I could hear him from upstairs.", "Agreed, it\u2019s not like paying a different landlord instead of OP would change the fact that it\u2019s cover part of the owners costs. That\u2019s the whole point of renting to people", "Agreed. Where I\u2019m from two people costs about 100$ in each utility a month, water is roughly 250 every two months, so that\u2019s about 400 give or take a month on bills depending what bills she\u2019s including (wifi, water, gas/energy, power etc) and rent.  \n\nThat\u2019s an amazing deal.", "My guess is he wanted to find out how much renting the whole house would be. Maybe he has friends he wants to move in, and was going to complain to the landlord to get OP out.", "Maybe he thought he could convince the \"landlord\" to move OP to the basement so he could have the rest of the house .", "I was in a shithole little house for $650/month two bed in Oklahoma utilities not included. This was 2012/2013 so definitely can\u2019t now!", "I\u2019m covering almost $300/month just in satellite TV and gigabit internet alone. Which he has full access to.", "Part of me wishes I could, but he does have a lease. I hope he looks at what\u2019s out there and realizes $650/month is a good deal. Aside from this incident, he\u2019s been a great roommate.", "Right. He could be charging between 1\u00bd-2 mortgage payments a month", "This right here. Tell him you're sorry he was under the wrong impression and you'd be happy to let him out of the lease early. See how quick he backtracks. \n\nYour mortgage is low because you have significant equity. If it was paid off you'd have no mortgage. Does that mean he should get to live there rent free? Hell no.", "Let's not get crazy here, market rate is for the soulless and greedy", "Hahahah what an amazing point!\n\n$650 for a two bedroom is unheard of. The cheapest two bedroom I\u2019ve ever had in my life was back in 2013 and it cost $1350 per month!!!", "Me too. Right when I started reading it.", "They aren't friends. The tenant is the brother of one of the OP's friends. \nA lease was signed. Unless the OP created an LLC for this, it is believable that OPs name and signature is also on the lease. NTA", "I think he should call his bluff as well. He could probably get market rent quickly and easily anyway.", "No idea. He\u2019s 21 and had never lived in a \u201creal\u201d rental situation. Only his parents home and dorms, as he just graduated in December.", "Sounds like it. It boggles the mind that he\u2019s mad at you for his misunderstanding of the situation. Maybe if he goes out and looks at other places, he\u2019ll realize how good a deal he has and will stop being a jerk.", "You\u2019ve been more than fair to him and not many would be so generous. If he can see that he\u2019s benefited from this arrangement then perhaps it\u2019s time to find a new tenant.", "That\u2019s a thing now. But he still didn\u2019t have to be a jerk about it", "Then maybe he needs to pull his head out of his backside and realize that you're doing him a favor, you're potentially losing out on income because of it, and he's very lucky that he knew someone with a home who had a basement they were willing to rent out on the cheap so he could live where he worked and be able to have a decent place. Personally, I don't understand the problem and him being mad about it sounds stupid. He's a renter. He is ALWAYS going to be paying off someone's mortgage, including his own if he ever saves up enough for a home. Why is it worse to help pay off a friend's who's doing you a favor than a strangers? What exactly does he expect? Seriously. Ask him that. \"Do you think I should just let you live here for free because I'm paying off my mortgage? Like, what do you expect, dude?\"", "Unless they plan on paying his bills they can keep their dumb opinions to themselves.\n\nLiterally everyone has to pay rent or a mortgage. That's how the world works. Doesn't matter your profession.", "Nope. Those family and friends are wrong. Don't listen to them. If he thinks you're taking advantage of him, he's free to break the lease (you said you'd let him) and go pay way more than he's paying living in your house. He's actually the one trying to take advantage of you. Don't let him.\n\nNTA", "What you are paying for the mortgage has zero to do with rent you collect. Hell, this isn\u2019t even a friend. Tell him he\u2019s free to move out if he doesn\u2019t like it but he is not free to correlate your finances with his.", "Your friends and family are wrong, your personal finances have nothing to do with his.    He needed a place to stay and you made an offer that he would not be able to match elsewhere.  He can improve his credit score by paying a couple of credit cards regularly.   Or maybe he wants to pay for his own internet service?", "Although I think this is totally unnecessary as you are giving this guy a sweet deal, you could list out the monetary value of the amenities you\u2019re paying for, similar to what some companies do when showing potential employees their compensation package.", "Your friends and family are wrong. You've already discounted the rent for this young man.   As long as you're reporting the rental income you're fine. Let him know that since you can easily rent the apartment for 1K a month if he wants to break the lease  you'll be fine with that and not charge him any sort of penalty.", "You\u2019ve also got upkeep and taxes. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you you deserve less because you got a break in life. Take all those gifts and maximize it so you can be generous elsewhere, spread the love. It\u2019s none of this guys business and if it was discovered earlier, he\u2019d likely not be living there. NTA but your friends don\u2019t want you better off than you are, that\u2019s a problem.", "If that\u2019s what they\u2019re thinking then he should also split utilities. It\u2019ll end up being the same or more.", "I'm  sorry but whomever doesn't  agree with ypu is delusional,  they can think whatever they want doesn't mean that's the right thing or that they have the right to judge you", "Well, at least you have him on your side. Good grief, I can't imagine going through life so dense.", "That's what i mean. He's being an entitled dick.", "Suggest that he check out apartment listings to see what a comparable place would cost. Where I live, $650/month for a two bedroom is a steal.", "I did not create an LLC or anything. Although I did have an attorney write the lease, I made sure it included no penalty for breaking it early as long as I'm given 45 days notice. I can definitely make the payments without a roommate but wanted to be able to save more each month simply because I like to travel, and I'm also taking on the financial responsibility of repairs and such since I do own the house.", "Maybe he needs to go back and live with mommy and daddy again.", "One of the reasons I gave him such a deep discount was that his salary is too low as a first year teacher, so I wanted to make sure he had enough to pay his bills and help his students, all of whom are from very low income families who can\u2019t afford basic supplies sometimes. And I want him to be able to actually save some money for emergencies.", "I\u2019m going to give him a few more days to stew, then try talking to him.", "You're also paying everything other household bill for things he's using as well.", "You are well within your right to charge whatever you wish for rent. If it's too high, no one will rent. \nDon't apologize, you've done nothing wrong \nI'm betting the tenant now feels an imbalance in your relationship. I.e. you're not \"equals\" any longer. \nEither tenant will work through this or they'll give notice and move.", "His brother did suggest that. \ud83d\ude02", "So not only are you giving him a break, but you're enabling him to help his students as well? What an ingrate.", "Which is very generous of you. I don't think that should be faulted. But I also just am sitting here boggling over these 'friends' getting on your back about it. It's boggling that they seem to expect you to just... let him move in rent free? That's the only other option I can see, since 'discounted rent' seems so offensive to them.", "Point out to him, and your friends and family, how much income you are losing per year by renting to him at less than market value. That is money that you could be saving towards your retirement, looking after your family, saving for your future. Your end of the finances is no one\u2019s business but your own. NTA", "I\u2019m certainly trying to help him help them. He got a job as a sub between January and May, before this school year began, and his class was 80% girls. Some of whom were using rolled up toilet paper as pads because they/their family couldn\u2019t afford sanitary products. So he bought a ton of products for them to use and take home. Before a few days ago I thought he was a really good person."]}
