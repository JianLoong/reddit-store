{"id": 24221, "submission_id": "15m1ug3", "title": "AITA for not telling my roommate I own the house?", "selftext": "Brief backstory: About a year ago my last remaining grandparent passed away and my father inherited all assets, including a house. I had been saving for a nice down payment (at least 50%) so I could have a lower mortgage payment each month, thus allowing me to save money for travel. When my father inherited this house, which he had no interest in moving into yet, he offered to sell it to me for well below market rate, with the caveat that he and my stepmother could eventually move into the basement apartment. I agreed, because they're both incredible people who are not at all invasive and would give me my privacy if they lived there. So he sold it to me and I moved in.\n\nPresent day: About six months ago I started considering renting out the finished basement apartment. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a small kitchenette (sink, fridge, microwave, but no oven). A friend of mine said his brother was moving to my city and needed a place. He's a brand new teacher and doesn't make great money, so he needed a place that wasn't expensive. I offered to let him rent my basement for way less than market rate ($650) which would include utilities. He readily accepted and signed a year long lease.\n\nWell a few days ago he asked if he could start paying the landlord directly instead of giving me rent money each month. I was under the impression my friend had told him I own the house, so I was confused and I told him we don't have a landlord and that I'm the owner. He got very upset and screamed at me for \"lying for over six months\" and \"taking advantage of him\" by making him pay so much in rent. For the record, an apartment similar to the one in my house would be well over twice what he's paying me, closer to three times for something as nice. He asked how much of my mortgage he's covering and I said \"Why does that matter? You're getting a nice, quiet place to live, access to a full kitchen and laundry room, and you're paying an amount that you can afford. My personal finances aren't really a factor here.\" He stormed out of the room and slammed the basement door. He's still not speaking to me.\n\nI asked a few other friends and some family members, and most said I'm wrong for having him cover my mortgage payments. Only a few say I'm in the right. So AITA for having my roommate cover $650 of my $775/month mortgage?\n\nETA: He has a lease so I won't be evicting him over this alone. If he does any damage or becomes hostile, I'll look at the eviction process. But for now, he will remain unless he chooses to break the lease (which I'd allow him to do if he wants). \nHe also didn\u2019t bother to read the lease before signing. The lease clearly states I\u2019m the homeowner. I didn\u2019t trick him or keep info from him. He simply didn\u2019t read what he was signing.", "created_utc": 1691546957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15m1ug3/aita_for_not_telling_my_roommate_i_own_the_house/", "score": 1669, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When he breaks the lease, you really need to increase the rent.", "NTA. The purpose of having a rental property like yours is to cut your mortgage down! Many people do this intentionally because it\u2019s a smart financial move.

Second, you clearly thought your friend told him you owned the house, I mean why else would he give you his rent? Third, your friends need to learn how renting works. Of course the rent goes towards the owner\u2019s mortgage (most of the time anyway), and why does it matter if you use it to pay your mortgage or stick it in your travel fund? He\u2019s still paying the same every month.", "NTA\n\nIf he\u2019s so unhappy offer to break his lease and let him find another place to live.

You don\u2019t need that a-hole let his ungrateful a$$ find another place to live. You are NTA and actually nice for what you\u2019ve done.", "NTA. Also he's not paying that much off your mortgage. Utilities are coming out of that also.", "Why did he want to change the way payment was made? Was he looking to take over and get you out? Hahahaha. Come to think of it didn\u2019t you also sign the lease as the landlord?\nEdit to add judgement NTA", "NTA", "Its none of his business and owning a house is a lot more than a mortgage and has nothing to do with market rate on a rental.    \n\n\nIf I pay of my house and choose to rent it would I offer it to free? No\n\nIs he going to pay half if the HVAC goes out or if you have a busted pipe , replacing old appliances.\n\nHe's coming from a spot of inexperience with being an adult and paying for adult stuff\n\nI would tell him that you understand he is upset and you are happy to let him out of the lease so he can find a place where he feels more comfortable.  But if he chooses to stay he better have your rent come next due date with a smile.\n\nNext time rent to strangers - never friends or friends of friends or family", "NTA. He's paying a good price, doesn't matter how that factors into your finances (and just how does he think renting anywhere else works?). \n\nSounds like he's also forgetting that he's not paying for the home owners insurance or the utilities.", "NTA, $650/month plus utilities? That's a sweet setup. I'd easily pay to have that. 2 bedrooms, 1 for sleeping and the other for hobbies and/or extra storage. In fact, I had a similar setup 20 years where I was a caretaker of a 2bed, 1 bed condo. The owner eventually decided to sell the place, so i moved back home", "He is renting a cheap space and it\u2019s none of his business what you use the money for. It would be just as accurate to say that you use the rental income for expenses rather than mortgage. NTA but he is and he\u2019s treating you badly considering the discount he\u2019s enjoying", "Omg NTA at all. He assumed. And you\u2019re not taking advantage. You\u2019re charging him next to nothing.", "NTA\n\nDoesn't matter who owns the property he would still be paying rent. He is paying well below market value he should be happy instead he could possibly have to move and PAY MORE.", "Seems like you're being more than fair, but if your tenant doesn't like the deal he's getting from you, he's welcome to find another place to live at the end of his lease.\n\nTBH, any tenant is usually covering a good portion of the owner's mortgage, if not all (or more), so he's getting off easy.\n\nNTA", "NTA. The amount you\u2019re asking is more than fair for an apartment of that size. It doesn\u2019t matter what your mortgage payment is and you owe him no explanation.", "He\u2019s being ridiculous. The house will be paid off one day. Would you be ripping someone off to charge rent?", "He is not your roommate. He is your tenant and you owe him no explanation. If you didn\u2019t have a mortgage would that mean he is entitled to live for free? One\u2019s mortgage has no bearing on what you SHOULD charge for rent. Market factors and personal preference guide this. You also didn\u2019t need to disclose anything. NTA", "NTA, you can own the house outright and rent rooms for a profit. Let him know he\u2019s free to break the lease and look for a cheaper place.", "NTA\n\nWhat is wrong with your family and friends?  Are you supposed to let someone live rent-free in your place? Even if it were for your friend instead of for his brother this would be an extremely entitled attitude.  And you are even offering at roughly half market rate.  After the lease is up let him go find another place.  Raise rent up to near market levels for any new lease since he has decided unilaterally that you are ripping him off. I'd consider cheap rent a favor in itself if I were in his shoes.", "NTA, it\u2019s irrelevant that you own it. It\u2019s a roommate lease. Not a friendship issue.", "NTA. Ask them what their problem is. You were planning on renting it out. You found someone to rent it to and you gave a lowered rent because it was through a friend. The renting was always going to happen. So why not to an acquaintance at a lowered rent as opposed to a stranger for a market rate? Where is the difference in this other than they get a deal? \"Am I not allowed to rent it out? Because I own it? What are you trying to say here?\" Frankly, it sounds like they're just salty you have the option and they don't. So it's better to villainize you as 'a greedy landlord' instead of just a poor tenant. \n\nConversely, you can also invite this person to go look at rental rates in the surrounding area and come back to you when he finds anything lower than what you're offering.", "I don't understand how anyone thinks you are in the wrong here. Does this person expect to live in your house for free? What am I missing? \n\nNTA.", "NTA - Give him a month to find a better arrangement... bet he stays.", "NTA. Talk to your friend about their brother's behaviour. \n\nAlso you're a landlord and they are your tenant. You are not roommates. This is important to remember because your rights and responsibilities are very different than if you're roommates.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. It\u2019s not your fault of the renter failed to his due diligence over who he was paying rent to. Also, you are allowed to make a reasonable profit on the space you are renting. You are renting the space at below market rates, which is what should matter to him, not how much of your mortgage his rent makes up. \n\nYou were 100% correct that your personal finances aren\u2019t his business.", "NTA. He's already getting 50% off the market rate. Your huge deposit is why your mortgage is so low and isn't any of his business. You aren't obligated to subsidize his housing any more than you already are.", "He is a manipulator and a bully. Recognize he has no intention of being honest or fair or civil from now on.", "You\u2019re kinda TA, if you\u2019re renting from your home it shouldn\u2019t be more than half your mortgage. If someone had a high paying corp job sure fine, but to a teacher? It\u2019s your life and choice but it\u2019s a real dick move. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night if it were me. You can do what you want but I think you kinda suck for that.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s paying well below market rate and the amount you\u2019re \u201cpaying in rent\u201d shouldn\u2019t impact this as it\u2019s your house. Would he expect to live there for free if you had already paid off the house and had no monthly payment?", "NTA, why does it matter if his rent is covering your mortgage? His rent would probably be covering the mortgage of a different landlord as well. Using that logic to get mad at you is dumb. He should be grateful you are giving him a deal. You could be fully covering your mortgage and have extra money on top of that if you did market value instead of the deal you are giving him.", "NTA\n\nTell the freeloader they can look for another rental. It is totally irrelevant who owns the property. They signed a lease and it\u2019s a binding legal document. If they don\u2019t like the terms, they can opt to not renew. I\u2019d also look into eviction requirements. There may be future shenanigans. \n\nNo good deed goes unpunished.", "Kick him out", "Nta but why did he even want to pay the landlord directly?", "NTA. Why shouldn't you make money from renting the apartment? Your friend knew you were the owner. More importantly, you weren't going to let him live there for free. That dude is a drama king IMO", "NTA - not your fault he didn't realise you were the owner/landlord, I'm assuming your name was the landlord on the lease agreement.  You're also NTA for having him pay rent no matter how much of your mortgage it covers, he's got a very decent apartment at a reasonable rent.", "Nta, what would have been the difference if there was a landlord and he was paying off their mortgage instead? Is he upset because you have a house and he\u2019s just starting his career? His reaction doesn\u2019t make sense.", "NTA", "NTA.  Whether his rent is more or less than your mortgage should be of no consequence to him. He agreed to the rate and signed a lease and that's all that matters. It would be no different if the renter was your sibling", "NTA - why are ppl looking at it as if he\u2019s paying your mortgage directly. What it is, is you\u2019re the landlord and he\u2019s paying you his rent, and where that money goes is no body\u2019s business but the landlords. If the money doesn\u2019t go into the mortgage where should it go? Back into his own pocket? He\u2019s a renter so he has to pay rent, anyone trying to argue their way out of paying rent is just delusional.", "OMG are they freaking serious?! What is they think people do when they rent? They cover the landlord's mortgage payment!\n\nYou are definitely NTA and quite honestly, do not renew the lease with this person. How entitled can one person be? I rented an Airbnb for a few months when I was new to the area. More precisely, I rented a bedroom. Yes, I had access to the kitchen, shared bathroom with whoever else were guests, shared laundry room, and pool, but still...bedroom, for more than you're charging for a finished basement apartment. It sounds like your renter is going to get sticker shock when he moves out.\n\nTell everyone who thinks you're ripping the guy off to check the market rate for the area then go kick rocks. Were you supposed to let him stay for free?!\n\nAgain, NTA but I think I'd start looking for smarter friends.", "Hard NTA. Never thought I'd be siding with a landlord on Reddit, but you haven't done nothing wrong. Your tenant and your friends seem to be too focused on the mortgage part, do they think normal landlords don't have mortgages to pay as well?", "NTA and wtf? We're renting a house and didn't even think to ask our landlord how much they're paying in mortgage. Who the hell thinks rent depends on the owner's mortgage?", "if he is mad, let him out of the lease and get a new tenant and charge market rates", "NTA. Dude expects you to let him live there for $300 a month or something? Some people don\u2019t realize how good they have it.", "He would pay much more anywhere else. What difference does it make to him? I would invite him to leave if he doesn\u2019t like it. Your friends don\u2019t seem to get it either.", "NTA...As a former realtor, that's how most rental property investors get to continue investing. They eventually get to a point to where the property more than pays for itself. \n\nI'm more concerned that this person seems entitled and has a temper, and HE'S A TEACHER. If your friends are around the same age as you and don't own property or know any investors, they don't have enough life experience to judge your actions on this matter. I'm certain, if put in the same position, most would agree with you.", "NTA,Sounds like he's got issues with the wonders of capitalism and ownership.None of your finances are his biz and he's way out of line", "No. NTA at all. He is renting a space in your house. It\u2019s the same as if he was renting from a faceless mystery landlord. Of course he\u2019s covering part of your mortgage. What does he think happens with any rent he has ever paid? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what percentage he\u2019s paying and you don\u2019t need to say anything about that. It\u2019s none of his business. He\u2019s getting a much lower than average rent for the area. That\u2019s all that matters. Tell him you will let him out of his lease if he\u2019s that unhappy about it but if he wants to stay he needs to get over it.", "NTA It sounds to me like he either thought that you were a renter who was trying to sublet part of the house to cover your bills or something else hinky was going on and he was calling your bluff by asking about the landlord. He was caught out when you told him the truth and threw that bit about paying your mortgage out there before thinking things through. He probably realizes how stupid that was and is keeping his head down.", "NTA. But you should have been clear in the lease signing process that you are the live-in landlord. Can't assume anything in legal situations", "NTA and I have no idea why he would react in such a dramatic way. A good deal is a good deal. I don't know why who he pays rent to matters.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re renting out the downstairs apartment to him a a super low rental price, how is it you\u2019re taking advantage? And who gives a shit whose mortgage it pays? \n\nPfft! Offer to let him go since it\u2019s such a big deal. He can find a place to rent elsewhere.", "NTA. I dont understand why there r other ppl who said to u that he shldnt cover your mortgage. N he isnt even covering the full mortgage also. So what did they expect u to do? Let him live there for free?? Wtf.", "NTA - your family and friends are completely wrong. So, are they saying that if the same landlord buys two identical houses next to each other and one has a $1000 payment and one has a $10,000 payment he should rent one for $500 and the other one for $5000 regardless of what market rents are? That is just silly. When you rent out property you own it is a business activity and you will also have future expenses. You are supposed to make a profit, otherwise why would you do it?", "NTA - the whole purpose of renting is to cover your mortgage!", "NTA. It has nothing to do with how much your mortgage is. (If your mortgage was $0, would he expect to stay there for free?) What matters is the market rate, and are there even any places in the US where you can find a safe, clean 2-br apartment for $650?", "NTA. The guy sounds like he's really immature and inexperienced.", "NTA i would not let him renew that lease.", "You should be charging market rate for the unit. How much you have financed is irrelevant.", "Wow what an ungrateful asshole. The roommate. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s paying your mortgage. Rent is rent regardless of who it goes to. He\u2019s getting a below market price. Why he thinks you owe him any favors is beyond me. He\u2019s not your friend or relative. Even if he were he\u2019s still getting a deal. People who think you\u2019re an asshole can rent to him at a lower rate then.", "Utilities are included! That is a steal! \n\nNTA \n\nAnd why was he wanting to pay the landlord directly? There is something fishy. It might be that he was thinking of trying to kick you out.", "NTA-May want to let your friend know their brother is biting the hand that offered him a good deal.  They may give their brother a reality check about what is out there.", "Fuck no. Market value is the cost.", "Absolutely NTA.  Either your friend is unbalanced it there is way more to this story.", "NTA. He\u2019s gonna say something like well you should lower it so we are both paying half. But here\u2019s the difference. He\u2019s not a friend, he\u2019s a brother of a friend. And your not over charging him. Yea he probably could get away with less but ultimately if it\u2019s still cheaper than other places. Without a bunch of neighbors and headaches that come with an apartment. He can leave if he doesn\u2019t like it but tell him your not entertaining this conversation anymore", "NTA. Why is he ok with paying some mysterious \"landlord\", but not you as a landlord? Who did he think he was signing a lease with?", "Wow, the cojones on this one.   I'd give him notice; if he thinks he can find a better deal, let him. \n\n$650 for a two bedroom with utilities included??   I don't think you could get that good a deal in Oklahoma.", "NTA", "NTA - You are charging less than market rate, what difference is it to him if you own it or not.  It is not his business.  What are you supposed to do in his mind, give it to him rent free?  Um, big NO.", "Nta....does he think he's not paying the owners mortgage if he's renting an apartment in a building or renting a house? He's getting really cheap rent. He should be happy. Even in the small town I live in where houses and apartments are on the cheaper side of most places in this country $650 isn't going to get you much. MAYBE a tiny one bedroom of a shitty apartment and it won't include electric and stuff. He sounds like an entitled ass. If he brings it up again tell him if he finds something cheaper then he's welcome to leave. He's forgetting, that may be moat of your mortgage payment, but you're also covering electric, water, trash, I'm assuming WiFi /cable. So in reality he's NOT covering most of it. He's paying his share of the bills for things he's using.", "NTA as other comments have said, let him \u201cfind something better\u201d", "NTA kick him to the curb.  Find another tenant that will be grateful for the affordable rent", "NTA. You have every right to rent the basement apartment at full market rate, let alone at the deal you are giving him. Tell him that you are perfectly willing to let him out of his lease immediately if he is unhappy with the arrangement. You can then rent it out at $1000 a month. \n\nDo your friends think that if you had no mortgage that it would be only fair to let people live there for free?", "NTA. Set up an LLC and stop renting for so far under market value. Either way don\u2019t renew with him since he will surely find a better deal elsewhere.", "NTA-  your mortgage has nothing to do with his rent.", "Definitely NTA, who cares who the landlord is, he is getting a great deal on rent.

He knows he has a sweetheart deal, a 2 bedroom apartment for 650 and that includes utilities?  Anytime he wants to look around the market and find another apartment, he's welcome to it.  \n\nDoes he think if he had an apartment in a new building his rent wouldn't be helping cover the mortgage payment for that building?  If he doesn't, then he is very naive.  Let him act however he wants.  If he keeps up the attitude, don't renew his lease.  Make sure if you go that route, you provide him timely notification you won't be renewing the lease.", "NTA\n\nTell him you\u2019re happy to break the lease without penalty if he\u2019d prefer to live elsewhere.\n\nAnd advertise at market rate when the lease is up.", "NTA. it's absolutely *none of his business* how much of your mortgage he might be paying. he's made the deal based on the information/lease presented to him, regardless of who owns the house or any other factors. \n\noffer to break the lease (or 2 months notice) for him if he thinks he can find somewhere comparable for the same amount or less! I'm sure you could easily get another renter in at that price.\n\nyeah, keep an eye on him. he's the AH. also.. don't become friends with him. keep it on a very business like basis.", "What a weird thing to get upset over.

Why would he be mad that you are the landlord? Don\u2019t tell him anything about your mortgage that\u2019s mot his business.

I had been saving for a nice down payment (at least 50%) so I could have a lower mortgage payment each month, thus allowing me to save money for travel. When my father inherited this house, which he had no interest in moving into yet, he offered to sell it to me for well below market rate, with the caveat that he and my stepmother could eventually move into the basement apartment. I agreed, because they're both incredible people who are not at all invasive and would give me my privacy if they lived there. So he sold it to me and I moved in.\n\nPresent day: About six months ago I started considering renting out the finished basement apartment. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a small kitchenette (sink, fridge, microwave, but no oven). A friend of mine said his brother was moving to my city and needed a place. He's a brand new teacher and doesn't make great money, so he needed a place that wasn't expensive. I offered to let him rent my basement for way less than market rate ($650) which would include utilities. He readily accepted and signed a year long lease. \n\nWell a few days ago he asked if he could start paying the landlord directly instead of giving me rent money each month. I was under the impression my friend had told him I own the house, so I was confused and I told him we don't have a landlord and that I'm the owner. He got very upset and screamed at me for \"lying for over six months\" and \"taking advantage of him\" by making him pay so much in rent. For the record, an apartment similar to the one in my house would be well over twice what he's paying me, closer to three times for something as nice. He asked how much of my mortgage he's covering and I said \"Why does that matter? You're getting a nice, quiet place to live, access to a full kitchen and laundry room, and you're paying an amount that you can afford. My personal finances aren't really a factor here.\" He stormed out of the room and slammed the basement door. He's still not speaking to me. \n\nI asked a few other friends and some family members, and most said I'm wrong for having him cover my mortgage payments. Only a few say I'm in the right. So AITA for having my roommate cover $650 of my $775/month mortgage? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's just common sense. \n\nI'm not sure where you got that if a landlord is renting from their home it should be half a mortgage but that's wrong. A landlord can charge whatever they wish, and he's charging way less than market value. The tenant, because he's not a roommate, doesn't have to live there. The tenant is free to break the lease any time, Op has already stated that. As it is, if the tenant decides to leave I guarantee you he will not find a better deal in which he has bills paid, has access to an in home washer and dryer, and doesn't have to deal with four neighbors on all sides. Plus, considering his utilities are included in that $650 that means his rent is maybe $200-300 a month and his utilities make it equal to $650 and holy shit that's a fantastic deal pretty much anywhere.", "It is $650.

Personally, I don't understand the problem and him being mad about it sounds stupid. He's a renter. He is ALWAYS going to be paying off someone's mortgage, including his own if he ever saves up enough for a home. Why is it worse to help pay off a friend's who's doing you a favor than a strangers?

You've already discounted the rent for this young man.   As long as you're reporting the rental income you're fine.

RIGHT?", "You\u2019re more than fair! \n\nMaybe they can offer cheap rentals and accept underpaid jobs for the sake of being fair. \n\nI\u2019d reply, well knock yourself out, nobody is stopping you taking them in.", "Socialism? Oh man he needs to talk to some of my husband\u2019s colleagues from former socialist regimes in Eastern Europe.  I know capitalism is a bitch, but talk to these people and they will laugh in your face very bitterly about our ignorance of the conditions they fled.", "It includes utilities?!? More than fair!", "Fair enough then. That's on him.", "I wonder if he had an agenda behind wanting direct contact with the landlord (when he thought they were someone different). i.e. Was he going to try and make a complaint to get you kicked out, thinking he could then lease your place instead (is it nicer?).", "It's too late with this tenant, but next time, you may want to consider doing what my SIL did.  She hired a property management company to collect the rent and act as a point of contact for the tenants.  The building had 3 units.  She lived in one of them, and nobody knew she was the owner.  She said the management company's fees were worth it.", "Their lawyer created a lease agreement, but you think they\u2019re not reporting the income?", "> And I want him to be able to actually save some money for emergencies.\n\nAnd he is paying rent so that you can save some money for emergencies for the house. Home expenses go beyond mortgage, taxes, and utilities. There insurance, there's setting aside money in case of emergency repairs, there's annual upkeep (tree trimming, roof/gutter cleaning, pest control), there's appliance repair/replacement, and who knows what else, especially if the house is older.", "Can you Update us on how it go with him", "Plus taxes, insurance, repairs, it can add up quickly.", "God I hate defending a landlord. Makes me feel dirty.", "Yep, and until someone is a homeowner they vastly underestimate the cost of home ownership. Surprise, your water heater died!  Guess you\u2019re out a few thousand dollars.", "OP, if you read the above, please consult a lawyer instead of taking above advice. As an owner occupant in my state, I was advised an LLC would do nothing if I am the sole officer of an LLC for a building I own, live in, and rent out. I believe he used the term \"not at arm's length\" and thus the LLC would be meaningless.", "And the house. And that's assuming OP doesn't do anything to pierce the veil. There are times when an LLC is appropriate but it isn't a must do.", "This. \ud83d\udcaf", "The dude in the story is paying less than the mortgage payment. So property taxes, maintenance fees, and utilities are all being paid by OP. That's probably more or less an even split -- OP gets the asset at the end because they also put up a ton of cash at the beginning. I also hate landlords, but this situation does actually seem fair.", "Totally!  This is nuts, what is wrong with people?  Property upkeep is no joke, he needs to also save for potential property repairs over time.  Not all landlords are slumlords. ei this person who is giving a friends relative a deal and this is the thanks?  Pfft.  Tenants.", ">So you think people should just pay for other people to live for free?\n\nImagine if we lived in a society where everyone who wanted a home could afford to buy it, and where home ownership was affordable for everyone on a single income. Imagine if instead of renting form a landlord or corp, rentals were through a non-profit. Tenants paid rent to cover the mortgage, repairs, and other bills, and anything left over was either spent on improvements or rebated to the tenants. \n\nRenters are still paying for their space, but in a non-profit system there isn't someone earning money off it.\n\nImagine having a system in place where everyone's housing needs are met without someone having to profit from a basic need instead of our current system that creates housing crisis after housing crisis. A system which is pretty much just people who already have more money getting to take money from people who have less, and not because they labored, not because they're talented or smart, not because they innovated, for no other reason than they already have more money than someone else.", "His bro is great. Very practical lol", "This is truly the answer. He is a child and doesn't understand how the world works yet. I bet he was trying to use some low income teacher program to buy the house out from under you.", "I have to say, your friend ist a really good Person (a real Keeper). \n\nNot only is He (so it seems) the only Person with a good brain (He Sees all the Things you do for his bro) but He also Stands by your Side to Help you.\n\nOnly keep Close the Friends Like him because the other peoples have shown their real greedy face.\n\nLike 'Oh OP you oooown the hooouuse, so Like you can Rent it to him for freeee'. 'what?! You greedy little OP, you want Money? Hoooow dare you'", "I really like this jerk's brother.", "There are a lot of places where, even with a lease, a landlord that lives on the property can give 30 days\u2019 notice to leave. It\u2019s a similar loophole to the one stating that a landlord can give 30 days if they\u2019re moving into the property. \n\nHowever, the person saying that you also suck is incorrect. You did inform him that you are his landlord when you gave him his lease, a legal binding document that stated you were the landlord. I\u2019m sure he has his own copy even. He\u2019s had the info available to him for six months. Hell, if I did want to pay a landlord directly, I\u2019d check my lease first! Guy is an idiot. \n\nAs for my own opinion on it, the only person I would go halves on a mortgage with is a spouse. This is a rental situation. You could charge more than your mortgage to make a profit and not be wrong! Stop talking to these people about your finances.", "And stupidity. My freshman year of high school, the school was short staffed. My 9th grade English lit class teacher was the home economics teacher. She assigned The Call of The Wild and gave us vocabulary words to define (srsly?). The kicker was she didn't know what some of the words meant herself. That alone prevented me from taking home ec. Always wanted to know how to used a sewing machine, too. How can you learn from someone that didn't even look up the assigned words before she gave them to us?", "Can confirm. I teach high school marching band. There's a reason the percussion staff imploded and has been completely replaced multiple times since I've been doing this (The band kid stereotypes remain true post high school), while me and the Winds/Visual/Guard staff have been consistent for years, only changing as life situations change.", "I\u2019ll keep my fingers crossed for you \u263a\ufe0f", "Oh gosh I know the feeling. I\u2019m sorry for your run of bad luck with the repairs.  I\u2019ve been there, done that.  We had this happen over the span of the last 4 years along with several pet deaths and deaths of parents and aunts and uncles and cousins.  One after another after another. Having the repairs being needed during supply chain shortages has been extra stressful. You have my complete empathy and I hope things look up for you soon.", "I thought as much! Thanks for clarifying.", "Well, yeah. You\u2019re right about that.", "That\u2019s when those Eastern European people find out that they weren\u2019t in a socialist country. Seriously. Even the classic example of communism, the Soviet Union, wasn\u2019t actually socialist for almost any time at all.\n\nIt was mostly an excuse used to steal from the masses to support the oligarchy. Sort of feudal-capitalism.\n\nMeanwhile countries with actual democratic & socialist policies are the ones with the happiest citizens & longest life expectancies.\n\nYour Eastern European friends would be like the conservative Cubans in Miami: mistreated, but misguided.", "This. And to complement: suggest researching what options he would have for the exact price he is paying. And that you expect an apology if he figures out the best option is to stay put. NTA", "Don't bother with this line of thought. The renter has dug in, generally people do not want to admit when they are wrong, and is upset at the balance of power shifting.\n\nJust tell the renter you are willing to break the lease, but research apartments or similar housing beforehand. Renter will should see the deal he is getting and walk it back tail between his legs. If he doesn't just break the lease, he is not worth the hassle.", "I\u2019m not sure what his motive was, except that he wanted to be able to add his payments to some app so he could boost his credit score. I guess that requires paying into some kind of system many landlords use? I don\u2019t know for sure.", "Definitely.", "OP is only technically a landlord. More importantly, OP is someone who was helping out a friend\u2019s brother by offering him a place to stay at well below market rate.", "Lol", "Home *maintenance* has costs as well.", "furthermore in some circumstances the LLC removes you from being able to treat a tenant as a lodger for the purposes of removing said lodger.", "That is a beautiful write up truly, but this isn\u2019t the landlord\u2019s fault that we\u2019re in this rent and lease holding pattern.

They can make a killing whether the economy is inflating or contracting, all they need is movement.", "This is the issue with short staffing and no money in education because you end up putting unqualified teachers in places they aren\u2019t experts in. Lord help anyone who takes math with someone who doesn\u2019t have it as a teachable. You never know though they might have been really strong as a home economics teacher! Though I would have at least used an answer key before assigning work I had no idea about lol\u2026..", "False equivalency. She's not an English lit teacher. What should she know about teaching it?in fact she teaches home economics so she might just maybe know a bit about it.

Not rocket surgery.", "Off topic from the AITA thread but - Teach yourself sewing. I did and found a fun hobby. \nStart with small things then work up from there. What is the worst that can happen?
