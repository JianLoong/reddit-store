I have multiple allergies + I'm a picky eater so we usually either cook separately or I cook 2 portions of a dish. That evening we cooked separately. He made spicy pasta with veggies and I just boiled noodles. When we sat at the table I brought a bottle of ketchup. He looked at me like I'm an alien and said \"you're not seriously planning on adding ketchup to pasta, are you?\". I said \"Yes, I am\". \n\nThen he loudly said ewww and made a disgusted face. I didn't say anything as I tried to not pay attention and just eat in peace. He then started making puking noises while staring at me eating.\n\nI asked him what his problem was and he called my dish disgusting. I told him if he doesn't like it then he's free to stop looking at it. He made a scene accusing me of being disgusting and eating disgusting food. He told me to throw it away and eat normal food which only made me mad. Throw away perfectly normal and fine food?! Because you don't like the combination? Is it really that big of a deal to eat pasta with ketchup???\n\nAt that point I had enough so I got up and went to eat in another room. When I returned he accused me of being an asshole and leaving him when he was \"just joking\". I almost lost it there. It's a conflict over freaking noodles with ketchup. We haven't spoken after I left.\n\nI vented to my 2 best friends about the situation and they both said they agree with him and that ketchup with pasta is disgusting and I should eat something else (?). I don't feel like an asshole here, but now I'm starting to doubt.\n\n\nSo AITA here?", "created_utc": 1681381777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kk7i1/aita_for_refusing_to_get_rid_of_my_pasta_with/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do people care so much what other people eat?", "This may be a very, very unpopular opinion, but NAH. \n\nI also have food allergies and can be a picky eater. As a child, think like 4 years old, I used to put ketchup on spaghetti too. At the time, I abhorred the smell/taste/texture of actual tomato sauce and was also having reactions to certain brands that we, my family and I, hadn\u2019t realized contained things I\u2019m allergic to in them. That being said, once I found a sauce that I wasn\u2019t allergic to, I very quickly outgrew using the ketchup as a sauce because the taste was too strong for me. It\u2019s basically like dumping a dump truck of sugar and vinegar on pasta and calling it a day. To this day I can still remember the flavor and, ngl it\u2019s traumatizing. Thus, while OP isn\u2019t a jerk for using the ketchup, as it is her prerogative, I can empathize with the bf.\n\nAlso, I find it interesting how so many people assume the bf\u2019s reaction is staged because of the retching sounds. For all we know it actually wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve already mentioned my past with doing what OP did, and how the taste was traumatizing. If I saw someone eating ketchup on pasta right in front of me, I\u2019d probably break out in sweats and start getting a bad taste in my mouth, involuntarily. Whether I started retching or not is an unknown at this point. Sometimes the memories of stuff are just enough to make people retch in that way, just like how some people throw up when they are having panic attacks, PTSD, or extreme social anxiety. And a taste is associated with memory.\n\nYes, assuming it wasn\u2019t faked, the bf probably should\u2019ve eaten elsewhere once he figured out he couldn\u2019t handle it instead of continuing the actions there and bothering OP. However, I am not convinced that people wouldn\u2019t have still been against him if he did that.

We already put all kind of shit in pasta and pizza anyway.", "Same . I was adopted by Italian family so I grew up in Italian household. I am revolted by this. But I\u2019d never say anything rude to them. If a close friend I might enquire and see if maybe then just never had real homemade sauce . Jarred sauce does taste like ketchup and it\u2019s gross to me. NTA.", "I do like this comment. I used to be a pretty picky eater growing up, but as I grew older I trained myself to start being more adventurous with food and flavor. It opened my world up to a ton of possibilities.", "Meh, most times I like my pasta with my nana's amazing homemade sauce \\[recipe\\] and sometimes I just want a little bit of butter and sweet/tangy ketchup (even knowing it wouldn't take long to beef up a jar of sauce), it's a comfort food to me and don't find it terrible at all.", "No such thing as eating as a child also ppl might have sensory issues or allergies", "Milk is a liquid that is supposed to be for baby mammals.

Strain the beans. Do you want the remaining sauce on pasta?", "I like it too.

I like a good hearty pasta sauce (I did not as a child), I also like ketchup on pasta (I did as a child). Sadly, one I have to hide, and one people accept.

OP clearly states she has allergies plus is a picky eater.  So picky she's eating plain noodles and then putting ketchup on them.  So again, both of them are essentially 4 year olds in adult bodies.  He shouldn't act rude about what she eats.  He is also probably exhausted by the two meal prep thing, the constant having to find a restaurant that has chicken tenders or plain noodles, etc.  Living with a picky eater means you have to do much more than just ignore or be polite about what they're eating, it impacts every single meal you have together, very tiresome.", "Ketchup is just tomatoes, vinegar, sugar and whatever complimentary spices you want.", "You\u2019re the one extrapolating that that\u2019s all she will eat.
