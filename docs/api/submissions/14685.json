I have multiple allergies + I'm a picky eater so we usually either cook separately or I cook 2 portions of a dish. That evening we cooked separately. He made spicy pasta with veggies and I just boiled noodles. When we sat at the table I brought a bottle of ketchup. He looked at me like I'm an alien and said \"you're not seriously planning on adding ketchup to pasta, are you?\". I said \"Yes, I am\". \n\nThen he loudly said ewww and made a disgusted face. I didn't say anything as I tried to not pay attention and just eat in peace. He then started making puking noises while staring at me eating.\n\nI asked him what his problem was and he called my dish disgusting. I told him if he doesn't like it then he's free to stop looking at it. He made a scene accusing me of being disgusting and eating disgusting food. He told me to throw it away and eat normal food which only made me mad. Throw away perfectly normal and fine food?! Because you don't like the combination? Is it really that big of a deal to eat pasta with ketchup???\n\nAt that point I had enough so I got up and went to eat in another room. When I returned he accused me of being an asshole and leaving him when he was \"just joking\". I almost lost it there. It's a conflict over freaking noodles with ketchup. We haven't spoken after I left.\n\nI vented to my 2 best friends about the situation and they both said they agree with him and that ketchup with pasta is disgusting and I should eat something else (?).

Why do people care so much what other people eat?", "Edit: Changing my judgement to NTA given potentially new info. Saying \u201cjust joking\u201d is trying to downplay the situation and immature on the bf\u2019s part. That being said: I stand by what so said earlier too, which is why I am leaving it down below. To sum it up: People can have involuntary reactions to memories (tastes, smells, etc.) that can include gagging/vomiting. Don\u2019t always assume people are doing it just to make you angry. Sometimes it cannot be helped, no matter how much we try.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPrevious Statements\n\nI also have food allergies and can be a picky eater. As a child, think like 4 years old, I used to put ketchup on spaghetti too. At the time, I abhorred the smell/taste/texture of actual tomato sauce and was also having reactions to certain brands that we, my family and I, hadn\u2019t realized contained things I\u2019m allergic to in them. That being said, once I found a sauce that I wasn\u2019t allergic to, I very quickly outgrew using the ketchup as a sauce because the taste was too strong for me. It\u2019s basically like dumping a dump truck of sugar and vinegar on pasta and calling it a day. To this day I can still remember the flavor and, ngl it\u2019s traumatizing. Thus, while OP isn\u2019t a jerk for using the ketchup, as it is her prerogative, I can empathize with the bf.\n\nAlso, I find it interesting how so many people assume the bf\u2019s reaction is staged because of the retching sounds. For all we know it actually wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve already mentioned my past with doing what OP did, and how the taste was traumatizing. If I saw someone eating ketchup on pasta right in front of me, I\u2019d probably break out in sweats and start getting a bad taste in my mouth, involuntarily. Whether I started retching or not is an unknown at this point. Sometimes the memories of stuff are just enough to make people retch in that way, just like how some people throw up when they are having panic attacks, PTSD, or extreme social anxiety. And a taste is associated with memory.\n\nYes, assuming it wasn\u2019t faked, the bf probably should\u2019ve eaten elsewhere once he figured out he couldn\u2019t handle it instead of continuing the actions there and bothering OP. However, I am not convinced that people wouldn\u2019t have still been against him if he did that. IMO, it\u2019s not up to everyone else to police what are or are not legitimate emotional responses, just like it\u2019s not up to anyone to police what someone eats.

And there are better ways to dress up plain pasta to make it more palatable.\n\nHowever! That being said, if YOU like it and find it tasty enough to get down and fill your belly, I don't see an issue with it. So, NTA for that.\n\nNow, putting on my \"Mom/Grandma for a minute\" hat.\n\nHon, ketchup and pasta isn't all that healthy. So, YTA for NOT taking care of yourself properly. Not because you put ketchup over pasta. But, because you are willfully neglecting YOURSELF. Don't care about your BF at this stage, he can go kick rocks. But, YOU, you really do need to take a hard look at how you are treating yourself. Like, I get the feeling you are not really big on prioritizing yourself and your needs, not to mention your overall health. As someone who is dying from NOT taking care of themselves very well when she was younger, I can tell you that it's a huge mistake NOT to prioritize yourself!\n\nI have to make a lot of things completely from scratch. Ketchup being one of them. Guess what? My homemade ketchup is pretty darned tasty on fries, hamburgers and especially darned tasty on some plain noodles. (I watched my daughter toss some on her elbow noodles and was curious, so I tried a bite. Holy heck balls! Add some parm and gosh it was scrumptious!) And it is ridiculously easy to make and store. (Pub mustard is even easier to make and tons of fun! Like a middle school chemistry experiment, but edible!)\n\nMy point is, Hon, focus on you and what YOU need to be healthy. Being a picky eater is fine, however, refine that \"picky eater\" thing to prioritize your health. Because your kidneys, liver and your endocrine systems will thank you. So will your uterus; because diet impacts your reproductive system functions, up to and including the severity of your period cramps and flow.\n\nMy strongest recommendation to you would be, if you have insurance coverage for it, go have your doctor pull a CBC with differential and a full Renal and Thyroid panel. Yes, the 3 are a bit repetitive in certain areas, but they will present a broader picture of what is going on with your internal organs and chemistry. Might even start shedding some light on just \\*why\\* you are a picky eater. (My gastric system is an asshole. I'm a \"picky eater\" because it literally HURTS like hell if I am not. If I were to eat a Mcdonald's cheeseburger, it would land me in the ER. It's gotten to where now I can take one bite of something and just \\*know\\* if it's going to hurt me, just by the taste alone. Isn't that fun at family gatherings!)\n\nMy next strongest recommendation to you is to lose the disrespectful boyfriend if he can't STFU and let you be you.\n\nFollowed closely by do not be afraid to experiment with cooking to YOUR tastes. (Want my ketchup recipe??) One of my favorite go to things to make when I am feeling especially lazy is some angel hair pasta tossed with a can of Hunt's Basil and Garlic diced tomatoes. Sprinkle on a little parmesan cheese and you have yourself a tasty snack or dinner side dish. Another favorite in my house is pasta tossed with a bit of butter, a dash of garlic and a sprinkle of basil. We've been known to toss in some frozen peas and carrots at the end of making it, just for some variety.  Point being, if YOU like it and it is providing adequate nutrition for YOUR needs, bloody go for it!\n\nHon, if you want, I will send you my ketchup recipe. Along with some of my favorite links to some simple recipe sites. You might say \"I hate cooking!\". OK, but, we all have to eat. And being a woman, your body has significant Nutrional needs that are going to suffer with just commercial ketchup and noodles. And, Hon, cooking isn't about a hated chore. Cooking is about TAKING CARE OF \\*YOU\\* and \\*YOUR\\* BODY. Which means, cooking is about caring and respecting YOURSELF, not about a hated chore.\n\nPart of what the issue is, IMO, is that you have a bunch of people surrounding you who couldn't care less about YOU and what YOU might need. When is the last time someone you know actually sat down with you and said \"I'm worried about you. Are you OK?\". I'm betting everything is all about them or all about your BF, never about you. Let me guess, you are always putting what you want to do or need secondary to what he wants or what others want? Don't do that!\n\nBabygirl! You are 23! Technically, a half-grown cub! Learning to take care of yourself! This means FOCUSING on YOURSELF! Your BF is \\*26\\* and has had time to figure out how to take care of himself, YOU do NOT need to do that for him! And he most certainly does NOT need to try to tell you what is best for YOU, he doesn't know that! No one does! Only YOU can figure that out and answer that question.\n\nNow, Hon, I am going to give you a big virtual hug here and tell you to STOP PUTTING EVERYONE ELSE AHEAD OF YOURSELF! YOU know what your body needs and if you don't, it will tell you! Part of finding out how to listen effectively to your body will be going for that well checkup and blood work.  And maybe checking out some therapy to help you put down some hard personal boundaries as well as how to yeet boundary stompers out of your sphere of influence.\n\nLove and hugs, Hon.", "YTA, that is just disgusting, you are free to eat tho, but I would probably also gag if I saw anyone in front of me eating noodles with ketchup", "Nta If you said those things about his food, everyone would be on his side because \"its normal food what's wrong with you,\" but because its something not usual or not what is a typical combo is a sin to eat it.

I personally wouldn't like it, but that's the point it's not my food, and it is what you like. My brother used to add ketchup to his Mac and Cheese, and I lightly teased him, but for the most part, I just ate my food, and he ate his. I know it's common for people to eat it like that, but I PERSONALLY don't like it. The shaming and the fake gagging noises are too much from him. Food is subjective because we all have different tastes in foods. I love mushrooms, and my brother hates them, so I compromise and put them on the side when I cook, or sometimes he'll just pick them out. Nobody should ever make you feel bad for what you eat and how you choose to eat it. \n\nWhen I was younger, I was obsessed with peas and would literally eat a warm bowl of just peas. My dad hated peas, and he would laugh a little he would make me some even when he didn't quite understand it. My mom did the same, so I must have gotten it from her. I hated cooked carrots (raw were fine) due to the texture, and my mom would pick them out for me. I no longer have that problem and enjoy them now, but nobody shamed me for my  tastes, nor would I shame others because food is different for everyone. \n\nThe only time I got strange looks was when I was having my birthday at sizzlers and had a steak and free chocolate mousse they gave me. I didn't want the mousse to get warm, so I took a bite of steak and then a spoonful of mousse, and weirdly enough, it didn't taste bad. My parents, of course, made a face and laughed along with me cause it was good-natured fun, and they thought I was silly. That's how it should be. He wasn't joking he was being a super judgemental asshole. It's one thing to tease but another to constantly make gagging noises and use shaming words to make you feel bad for your choices. \n\nI once ate mustard on a hotdog bun without the hotdog. I don't normally eat mustard, and to be fair, I was drunk, but I actually enjoyed it a lot. Was it weird in the moment? Yes. Did anyone shame me? No. They just thought it was funny cause i was drunk. People would be surprised what ingredients are used in food to amplify the flavor. Some people use coffee to rub on meats (which I realize is more common now for some people, but at the time, I was surprised) and some of the best foods I have eaten was from mixing stuff I didn't think would work together but actually made something 10 times better. \n\nI personally have very sensitive taste, so I do like flavor in food, but I get overwhelmed with over salted stuff, sweet stuff, and overly cooked meat and vegetables. My mom was an amazing cook, but because of her smoking, she over peppered food cause her taste was dull.  Eventually, she started peppering it extra on her own plate instead of when she's cooking cause many of us were having a hard time eating it.
