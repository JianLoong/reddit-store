I have multiple allergies + I'm a picky eater so we usually either cook separately or I cook 2 portions of a dish. That evening we cooked separately. He made spicy pasta with veggies and I just boiled noodles. When we sat at the table I brought a bottle of ketchup. He looked at me like I'm an alien and said \"you're not seriously planning on adding ketchup to pasta, are you?\". I said \"Yes, I am\". \n\nThen he loudly said ewww and made a disgusted face. I didn't say anything as I tried to not pay attention and just eat in peace. He then started making puking noises while staring at me eating.\n\nI asked him what his problem was and he called my dish disgusting. I told him if he doesn't like it then he's free to stop looking at it. He made a scene accusing me of being disgusting and eating disgusting food. He told me to throw it away and eat normal food which only made me mad. Throw away perfectly normal and fine food?! Because you don't like the combination? Is it really that big of a deal to eat pasta with ketchup???\n\nAt that point I had enough so I got up and went to eat in another room. When I returned he accused me of being an asshole and leaving him when he was \"just joking\". I almost lost it there. It's a conflict over freaking noodles with ketchup. We haven't spoken after I left.\n\nI vented to my 2 best friends about the situation and they both said they agree with him and that ketchup with pasta is disgusting and I should eat something else (?). I don't feel like an asshole here, but now I'm starting to doubt.\n\n\nSo AITA here?", "created_utc": 1681381777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kk7i1/aita_for_refusing_to_get_rid_of_my_pasta_with/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do people care so much what other people eat?", "This may be a very, very unpopular opinion, but NAH. \n\nI also have food allergies and can be a picky eater. As a child, think like 4 years old, I used to put ketchup on spaghetti too. At the time, I abhorred the smell/taste/texture of actual tomato sauce and was also having reactions to certain brands that we, my family and I, hadn\u2019t realized contained things I\u2019m allergic to in them. That being said, once I found a sauce that I wasn\u2019t allergic to, I very quickly outgrew using the ketchup as a sauce because the taste was too strong for me. It\u2019s basically like dumping a dump truck of sugar and vinegar on pasta and calling it a day. To this day I can still remember the flavor and, ngl it\u2019s traumatizing. Thus, while OP isn\u2019t a jerk for using the ketchup, as it is her prerogative, I can empathize with the bf.\n\nAlso, I find it interesting how so many people assume the bf\u2019s reaction is staged because of the retching sounds. For all we know it actually wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve already mentioned my past with doing what OP did, and how the taste was traumatizing. If I saw someone eating ketchup on pasta right in front of me, I\u2019d probably break out in sweats and start getting a bad taste in my mouth, involuntarily. Whether I started retching or not is an unknown at this point. Sometimes the memories of stuff are just enough to make people retch in that way, just like how some people throw up when they are having panic attacks, PTSD, or extreme social anxiety. And a taste is associated with memory.\n\nYes, assuming it wasn\u2019t faked, the bf probably should\u2019ve eaten elsewhere once he figured out he couldn\u2019t handle it instead of continuing the actions there and bothering OP. However, I am not convinced that people wouldn\u2019t have still been against him if he did that.

For example. Yesterday I saw a  post about someone who ate a pepperoni pizza with chocolate on top.  If he doesn't like it he can look away", "Um, well, basically, ketchup is sweetened tomato sauce. And there are better ways to dress up plain pasta to make it more palatable.\n\nHowever! That being said, if YOU like it and find it tasty enough to get down and fill your belly, I don't see an issue with it. So, NTA for that.\n\nNow, putting on my \"Mom/Grandma for a minute\" hat.\n\nHon, ketchup and pasta isn't all that healthy. So, YTA for NOT taking care of yourself properly. Not because you put ketchup over pasta. But, because you are willfully neglecting YOURSELF. Don't care about your BF at this stage, he can go kick rocks. But, YOU, you really do need to take a hard look at how you are treating yourself. Like, I get the feeling you are not really big on prioritizing yourself and your needs, not to mention your overall health. As someone who is dying from NOT taking care of themselves very well when she was younger, I can tell you that it's a huge mistake NOT to prioritize yourself!\n\nI have to make a lot of things completely from scratch. Ketchup being one of them. Guess what? My homemade ketchup is pretty darned tasty on fries, hamburgers and especially darned tasty on some plain noodles. (I watched my daughter toss some on her elbow noodles and was curious, so I tried a bite. Holy heck balls! Add some parm and gosh it was scrumptious!) And it is ridiculously easy to make and store. (Pub mustard is even easier to make and tons of fun! Like a middle school chemistry experiment, but edible!)\n\nMy point is, Hon, focus on you and what YOU need to be healthy. Being a picky eater is fine, however, refine that \"picky eater\" thing to prioritize your health. Because your kidneys, liver and your endocrine systems will thank you. So will your uterus; because diet impacts your reproductive system functions, up to and including the severity of your period cramps and flow.\n\nMy strongest recommendation to you would be, if you have insurance coverage for it, go have your doctor pull a CBC with differential and a full Renal and Thyroid panel. Yes, the 3 are a bit repetitive in certain areas, but they will present a broader picture of what is going on with your internal organs and chemistry. Might even start shedding some light on just \\*why\\* you are a picky eater. (My gastric system is an asshole. I'm a \"picky eater\" because it literally HURTS like hell if I am not. If I were to eat a Mcdonald's cheeseburger, it would land me in the ER. It's gotten to where now I can take one bite of something and just \\*know\\* if it's going to hurt me, just by the taste alone. Isn't that fun at family gatherings!)\n\nMy next strongest recommendation to you is to lose the disrespectful boyfriend if he can't STFU and let you be you.\n\nFollowed closely by do not be afraid to experiment with cooking to YOUR tastes. (Want my ketchup recipe??) One of my favorite go to things to make when I am feeling especially lazy is some angel hair pasta tossed with a can of Hunt's Basil and Garlic diced tomatoes. Sprinkle on a little parmesan cheese and you have yourself a tasty snack or dinner side dish. Another favorite in my house is pasta tossed with a bit of butter, a dash of garlic and a sprinkle of basil. We've been known to toss in some frozen peas and carrots at the end of making it, just for some variety.  Point being, if YOU like it and it is providing adequate nutrition for YOUR needs, bloody go for it!\n\nHon, if you want, I will send you my ketchup recipe. Along with some of my favorite links to some simple recipe sites. You might say \"I hate cooking!\". OK, but, we all have to eat. And being a woman, your body has significant Nutrional needs that are going to suffer with just commercial ketchup and noodles. And, Hon, cooking isn't about a hated chore. Cooking is about TAKING CARE OF \\*YOU\\* and \\*YOUR\\* BODY. Which means, cooking is about caring and respecting YOURSELF, not about a hated chore.\n\nPart of what the issue is, IMO, is that you have a bunch of people surrounding you who couldn't care less about YOU and what YOU might need. When is the last time someone you know actually sat down with you and said \"I'm worried about you. Are you OK?\". I'm betting everything is all about them or all about your BF, never about you. Let me guess, you are always putting what you want to do or need secondary to what he wants or what others want? Don't do that!\n\nBabygirl! You are 23! Technically, a half-grown cub! Learning to take care of yourself! This means FOCUSING on YOURSELF! Your BF is \\*26\\* and has had time to figure out how to take care of himself, YOU do NOT need to do that for him! And he most certainly does NOT need to try to tell you what is best for YOU, he doesn't know that! No one does! Only YOU can figure that out and answer that question.\n\nNow, Hon, I am going to give you a big virtual hug here and tell you to STOP PUTTING EVERYONE ELSE AHEAD OF YOURSELF! YOU know what your body needs and if you don't, it will tell you! Part of finding out how to listen effectively to your body will be going for that well checkup and blood work.  And maybe checking out some therapy to help you put down some hard personal boundaries as well as how to yeet boundary stompers out of your sphere of influence.\n\nLove and hugs, Hon.", "YTA, that is just disgusting, you are free to eat tho, but I would probably also gag if I saw anyone in front of me eating noodles with ketchup", "Nta If you said those things about his food, everyone would be on his side because \"its normal food what's wrong with you,\" but because its something not usual or not what is a typical combo is a sin to eat it.

That's being said...that's just nasty.", "NTA, eat what you like but ditch the negative asshole you are dating!", "NTA and, even though I know my ancestors would find the combo criminal, I love ketchup on pasta with some garlic salt and olive oil. I actually ate it last night with saut\u00e9ed garlic and it was bomb. I get that he might find it gross, many do, but he was extremely rude and then tried to gaslight you about it.", "You have the right to put ketchup on whatever you want\u2026 I guess. It\u2019s not a choice I would make, but you certainly should be able to eat your meal in peace. Therefore NTA.", "NTA.\n\nHe's free to have an opinion, but he's not free to control your food choices and he sure as Hell wasn't raised right if he thinks *making puking sounds* and bullying you to throw away *your meal* is the right way to behave at dinnertime.\n\nI wouldn't be happy with how easily he thought that this would fly. Your friends need to stfu. It's not about whether noodles and ketchup is acceptable. It's about his attitude and controlling nature.", "That\u2019s really gross. But NTA at all, you can eat what you want and it shouldn\u2019t be this bigger deal. \nMy partner eats weird combinations sometimes too, (not as bad as that) but I just don\u2019t eat it and leave them to eat whatever", "He wasn't just joking. Does he do anything else like that, then try to claim he wasn't?", "Okay, I have a confession. I put ranch and sprinkle cheese on my noodles and call it poor man\u2019s Alfredo. And it\u2019s really good. Anyway, NTA.", "NTA I feel like people with an expansive pallete don't realise that being a picky eater, for whatever reason, IS NOT FUN. It sucks. Mealtimes are constant sources of stress. Eating outside of the home is a fucking sacrifice of time, money and comfort for the sake of social or professional commitments. So, if your boyfriend doesn't care about you enough to deal with you eating a simple dish in front of him, dump the AH because life is too short to out up with someone who treats you like shit just because he doesn't like your food.", "Think it\u2019s a discussing combination personally. But your choice. Eat what you want", "ESH, though him loads more. For you it\u2019s just the picky eating that makes you a tiny AH. Adult picky eaters are so hard to be around, and pasta with ketchup is already bad as a children\u2019s dish. But he completely overreacted, and since he chose you as a partner while knowing how you eat, he has no right to complain.", "NTA. Ketchup on pasta is a monstrosity, but you're the one stuck eating it. (Seriously, gagging and fake vomiting? Why are you dating a 5 year old?)", "Gag me", "Definitely NTA. You eat what you wanna eat even if it might be disgusting to others. In my household, we use to put ketchup on our rice and I loved it a lot. I also really liked putting fries inside of a hot dog and dipped it in ranch in elementary school and all my classmates were super grossed out by it and said I had disgusting taste in food. \n\nYour boyfriend is the asshole for being so immature.", "NTA. \n\nHave you tried noodles with tomato sauces and butter? It\u2019s pretty good.", "NTA. What the actual fuck is wrong with him and your friends. I'm a bit of a picky eater myself, and do tend to make 'weird' food choices but those around me just accept it. If they don't like it, they might say something, but they won't actively be a dick like your bf was. \n\nPasta and ketchup is quite nice. It's literally a tomato sauce with pasta, what is people's issue-? Is that not what a typical pasta dish looks like?", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think I would enjoy ketchup on pasta, but I would never tell someone else they can\u2019t eat what they want. The only person who is disgusting is your bf.", "I used to put strawberry jam and shredded cheese on my toast. NTA.", "NTA, it's not for me but it's not like you shoved fistfuls of it down his throat. My little brother used to eat ketchup sandwiches, which are exactly what you think they are, so I got used to non-standard combinations early on....", "Look I\u2019m Italian and even though your taste kills my culture just a bit, I have to say that\u2019s what makes the world great.. the fact that we all like different things. Acting like this he just shows his parents didn\u2019t educate him in any level of life. You are no AH and you might even want to look for better friends, since you don\u2019t seem to be free to be yourself with the current ones. Good luck and enjoy whatever food makes you happy!", "Sketti\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt'd be different if you were making HIM eat like you are...but you're not. While that's not my own cup of tea, to each their own with their likes and taste preferences in food.", "Your food selection is a bit childish but you are still an adult human, able to make their own decisions. NTA but your BF is", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d never eat it but I wouldn\u2019t eat tomatoes in any form.", "NTA. Keep the ketchup, dump the asshole.", "While that does sound absolutely vile (ketchup is straight up banned in my house it\u2019s disgusting), you\u2019re NTA, your bf behaved like a prat in this situation.", "As someone who has eaten and enjoyed spaghetti with Nutella, NTA", "Your not the ass!\nI love my noodles with ketchup and cheese. Its easy and I like it.\nWhat also tastes good in addition some sausages or the like roasted in the pan also in veggie sausage~\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t yuck my yum\u201d\n\nEveryone has different tastes. Sounds like you shoulder the burden of multiple dishes to work around your allergies which is more concessions for him than it sound like he deserves.\n\nKeep on eating what makes you happy.\nKeep", "Yes, it\u2019s gross but making barf noises and harping on it are worse.", "NTA. A lot of people grew up eating that as a struggle meal and it\u2019s comfort food. \n\nIt is extremely immature of your bf to make faces and gagging sounds about another person\u2019s meal. I would not allow my kids to act that way, never mind a whole adult.", ">He then started making puking noises while staring at me eating.\n\nFam, are you _sure_ your boyfriend\u2019s not just two 7 year olds in a trenchcoat?\n\nKetchup on pasta is the most tame thing I\u2019ve ever fuckin heard for food, \u201cfood crime\u201d or not. I have fries and mayo (it\u2019s literally egg and chips and no one can convince me otherwise, shit\u2019s good) regularly, a friend of mine dips her pizza in ketchup (that\u2019s good too) I\u2019ve had ketchup on rice in the past (not so nice, but hey) If it tastes good, and you don\u2019t waste the food, and it doesn\u2019t trigger allergies in someone else, so what?\n\nMy brain literally cannot fathom how you would be the AH in this situation. NTA, NTA a million times over. Tell your boyfriend (and friends, for that matter) to grow up.", "Couldn't have said it better.\nIt's a food crime.\nFood crimes don't make a person TA as long as the perpetrator inflicts them on herself only.\nBoyfriend was offensive and disgusting with his retching noises, then went full asshole for blaming OP for not wanting to sit through that.\n\nNTA OP and revel in your food crimes.", "This all the way. He's TA, you're NTA... but like... wow... check your menu, it's broken hahaha", "Really I love the combination of baked beans mayo and ketchup in pasta,I was in boarding school and everyone loved ketchup on their noodles, my sibling add ketchup to their pasta. I didn't know that was an ewww thing....you really learn new things everyday(mind completely blown)", "Based on her food choices I would say they might both be 9.", "To be fair to OP, it\u2019s hard to have good taste in men when the pickings are slim \ud83d\ude02", "It's basically just sugar and vinegar pasta with a small amount of tomato.", "Man, banana ketchup is so good, though.", "I\u2019ve always wanted to try banana ketchup! Where can I buy it from?", "I'm Scandinavian and these comments are wild! It's really common for children and picky eaters, while also being the most common \"starving student\" meal", "Yeah, I'm like... I don't understand. Spaghetti is what ketchup is for! What do all these weird internet people use it for? Fake blood?", "I have never met someone who does this.", "This is not information you need to render a judgment", "She LIKES the ketchup. Food doesn\u2019t have an age. What she eats has ZERO effect on anyone else. Get over it.", "* disgusting", "OP, NTA\n\nKetchup is not that far from normal tomato sauce, the only huge difference is that ketchup has a little bit of vinegar to it. \n\nThere is no way in hell it's that big of a deal, or else y'all are just sensitive AF \ud83e\udd23", "10/10", "Being judgemental about what someone else is actively trying to eat is an AH move; don't judge what others like to consume. Most people have eaten something others may call weird at one point or another; their food, their taste buds, their choice.", "It was my after school meal when I was a kid and my parents weren't home. It's a lot like spaghetti-o's with a little more tang to it. I never understood why people find the combo gross. Japanese use Ketchup all the time in their cooking - in lieu of tomato paste. The vinegar adds more depth to the tomatoes.", "I still do.\n\nLike, not a ton of ketchup. Just a little to add some acidity and sweetness to counter the cheese I put on it. It's my go-to lazy meal.\n\nRice pasta, tiny bit of ketchup, some cheese, maybe some frozen veggies I steamed in the microwave.\n\nI wouldn't serve it to anyone else, but it's, you know, fine.", "You have strange tastes but it's no cheese off my pasta.\n\n(I dip quartered apples in melted blue cheese, so who am I to judge anyway?)", "I don't know why you are being downvoted, I couldn't care lass about what other like to eat even if it sounds super weird to me. \n\nIt's not like we get any harm from people eating what they want, right?", "reddit out here advocating for a breakup over ketchup and poor communication", "Dude what", "?", "Ketchup is too sweet plus it's cold. Different texture too. It's not the tomatoes that make it gross!", "Ketchup has very little tomatoes. It's mostly sugar and vinegar. Most US brands have tomatoes as the third ingredient behind vinegar and corn sugar.", "I adore mushroom ketchup...", ">Not saying I would do it because i am just not a fan of ketchup in general but the combination really isn\u2019t that wild. \n\nI wouldn't call it *wild*, it's just ketchup *on it's own* doesn't have the right balance for pasta sauce. The Salt, Sour & Sweet profiles are out of whack. It would be like adding salt to your bacon or sprinkling splenda onto your cheesecake.\n\nMix that ketchup with a little mayo and ideally a pinch of basil and you have a tenfold improvement. The salt sour and sweet are put into balance, the oil in the mayo improves the mouthfeel, and the optional basil stops the flavour from having only one dimension.", "you\u2019ve got to be kidding me. they taste nothing alike. that\u2019s like saying ice cream and camembert taste the same because they\u2019re both basically milk.", "Ketchup has lots of sugar in it too.", "Dawg they may both be tomato based, and I may love both, but ketchup does not belong on pasta. It just doesn't. Noooo.", "Never understood why people care so much about what others eat. If it's something they enjoy, then so be it. Especially considering they cooked separately.\n\nFor me, I used to eat sunny side eggs over rice with ketchup and soy sauce growing up", "Was about to say - this just sounds like Napolitan pasta to me??", "Sounds like a lazy primavera, also sounds amazing", "(it was a joke - they agree with you)", "My aunt used to eat ketchup on pumpkin pie.", "My boyfriend hates drinking milk and I love it. He often jokes when he sees me drinking milk. I laugh at it, because it is harmless teasing. Once, he had eaten something too spicy and couldn't get the spice out of his mouth, so I offered him a sip of my milk and he took it. The face he made was so funny, it was my turn to laugh.\n\nI think most people can tell the difference between a joke or 2 and people like OP's BF who made puking noises and said she should throw out her food.", "I've seen people online saying that putting ketchup on rice is disgusting and a heinous crime - but I love it. And that's my business. I'm not making anyone else eat it! Each to their own and all that.", "Today it could be what she eats which may be minor but tomorrow could what she dresses as or the family that comes in her lives.

If he doesn't like what she is eating now, then he can offer to make something better according to her health needs.", "I think it's normal to not eat like an 8 year old. This would be a huge red flag for me.", "It is absolutely not like putting salt on bacon or Splenda on cheesecake. Noodles are neutral.", "By all means, absolutely. I was only agreeing that we can change our tastebuds over time. In my case I can now enjoy food I would have hated", "Have you looked at commercial spaghetti sauce?", "hmm croissant aux amandes !\n\n(recipe for non-French: croissant from the day before, stuffed with almond cream and sprinkled with almond slivers and then slightly baked)", "Why bother... What? Care? Be grossed out?\n\nI don't need to be eating that to find it disgusting. The sight, sounds, and smells are enough for that.", "Yeah and the vinegar and sugar are playing a big role here. The taste and texture are very different. \n\nBy your logic, orange juice and milk are similar since it's mostly water, sugar and various flavourings.", "Ehhh ketchup and tomato sauce are much closer. \n\nMore like comparing half and half with  milk.", "I think you're getting downvoted out of spite here. Ketchup is versatile AF and vinegar isn't used nearly as much in North American cooking, so ketchup can be used to add a little something to so many dishes.", "I think people just imagine huge amounts of ketchup, which would be gross. \n\nLike yeah if you use ketchup like you use tomato sauce it's going to be nasty."]}
