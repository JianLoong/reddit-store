Acutal. Fuck?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "Dude is a grown ass man. Can get their own food and rub themselves. If he wants to be cute and do something he can stop poking you, let you sleep, make breakfast, and serve you in bed/at the table. You\u2019re NTA for sure.", "If I were OP I'd just put a basket of fruit snacks and a bottle of ibuprofen on his bedside table and sleep in another room.", "Right! This is grounds for midnight murder", "yep. if you\u2019ve got a guest room, get up and go sleep in there the next time he pokes you. if you don\u2019t, but you can manage the couch, go sleep there. no matter what, do not give this overgrown child what he asks for. this is, frankly, infuriating. ugh. nta.", ">leave it in the fridge to heat up\n\nWhat?", "Weaponized incompetence right here. It sounds like either a control issue or a payback issue. You need to sit him down and find out exactly what is going on here. Maybe he's sick of driving you to work but is afraid to tell you so he's getting back at you in these weird ways?\n\n\nJust a guess, but go have that discussion. And tell him you're not making him food or whatever else he wants in the middle of the night. He's not a child.\n\n\nAlternately, you could bring him some warm milk in a sippy cup next time he asks.\n\n\nNTA", "Jesus, even after a certain age the parent would not put up with that behavior. This is, possibly literally, infantile.", "Same. My number one pet peeve is being woken up, and if my husband ever tried to wake me up for such nonsense I would seriously contemplate my relationship.\n\nHowever, he is a mature adult and will get a snack if he\u2019s hungry or take an ibuprofen if he\u2019s sore. \n\nNTA for sure.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. \n\nIt also seems like the husband may be annoyed that he has to drive OP to work, and is trying to hold that over OP\u2019s head. Not being able to sleep in because you have to take your spouse to work is very different than waking someone up in the middle of the night for a snack and back rub. I\u2019m curious if he holds it over OP\u2019s head that he drives her to work to guilt her into doing other stuff for him.\n\nI would figure out if there was some other way to deal with the back pain, such as a heating pad or a massage chair/cushion.", "Very true. I can't have my cats in my bedroom when i go to sleep ( 1 wants to sing me the song of his people the whole night and the other NEEDS the door open around 4am). They learned there's no cheating around this rule. My father used to do this to my mom (back to OP's story) and she took her time to wise up. It is more about using your spouse and the high of that controlling over them than the actual need ( that is easily done by oneself - food exists free in the kitchen, painkillers too). NTA and please understand that if he has to be \"paid\" like this for his waking up earlier to drive you, you can always find other arrangements that could work better for you that would not involve you slaving/catering to his \"needs\" in the middle of your sleep. You do deserve better, like a good night's sleep and respect.", "He wants a mommy. NTA.", "This! Many people don't drive for good reasons. When you enter into a relationship knowing someone doesn't drive, you can't hang it over their heads and use it to get what you want. There's a big difference between driving your spouse to work and disrupting their sleep schedule for things you can do for yourself.  Op definitely NTA.", "That's not always feasible, though. Myself, I'm disabled and it's not safe for me to drive on my own. Also, the fact he's holding this one thing over her head is awful and wrong, and he can suck it up and drive his spouse to work if she can't do it herself. Because I'm also guessing, from his behavior here, he's not good for much else. Not helpful around the house, given his entitlement with this.", ">Wake him up to get you a snack\u2026back rub \u201cbecause that\u2019s what we do now apparently\u201d After a couple of times he\u2019ll get the message\n\nShe's not the asshole, but she's already waking him up with her snoring and to drive her to work. You want her to wake him up even more?", "its ridiculous even for a small child (beyond baby with bottle) but at least understandable but an adult then wtf.", "What the fuck is this. OPs husband is not a child who doesn't understand the concept of sleeping, he is a grown fucking ass man. Nobody should have to tell him that if he is hungry in the middle of the night that he has to make the food himself. That is not something that needs to be communicated that is basic common sense.", "This is the worst take ever\ud83d\ude02", "So OP can just wake up early to take the bus and he can get his own snackies in the night like a big boy.", "He can damn well put them himself.", "Like put it on the fridge so it didn't go bad, then heat it up when he's ready for it", "I think they meant that the husband should have food in the fridge to later grab and heat up in the middle of the night when he\u2019s hungry", "My ex husband did this literally for years just to torture me and I let him because I was his wife. I didn't find out till after the divorce that he just thought it was funny or he was bored.", "Mashed bananas and children's Motrin for the back pain.", "Love this so much! The sippy cup\u2026. Lord that\u2019s funny", "It could be that he wants her exhausted and feeling guilty so she\u2019ll quit. Solves his problem. She rubs his back bc he\u2019s guilted her with the wife card AND no car rides to work AND those ribs are more readily available", "Or - God forbid - he acts his age and makes his own appointment with a doctor to have it checked out.", "Honestly OP would get the same amount of sleep as she is right now if she just woke up earlier to take public transportation.  But it'd be uninterrupted at least.", "Maybe you've got a nicer mum than mine, mine wouldn't have made me snacks in the middle of the night. She'd have told me to go back to bed. (She did massage my knees though, when they were hurting, which sometimes happened at night).", "Yeahhh they're comparing a job to making a snack at 3am? \n\nWorst. Take. Ever.", "Yeah sleep deprivation is actual torture and an abuse tactic to keep victims in their control."]}
