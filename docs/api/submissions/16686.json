This just started about a week ago, and I didn't do it every time.  last night,  he wanted me to microwave his leftovers at 3 a,  and I did it just so he would stop saying he was hungry. I'm going to stick to telling him no and not do it.\n\nEdit 2: I get panic attacks when I drive. I am thinking of getting lessons at a driving school, but it's hard when they are so expensive, and I am not sure how they would deal with the panic attacks.\n\nEdit 3: he is not a cat. Thanks everyone. I was standing my ground about not doing it and I wanted to make sure I was right. It's good to know so many agree with me. Chances are he will try again and when I say no he will stop. Or will stop now that we had the argument about it. I don't plan on giving in to him being childish about this.
