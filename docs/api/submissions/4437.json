Hubby & I have 2 kids together (2 & 8.) Stepson & girlfriends relationship has been extremely toxic, up until recent their drama has not involved anyone else in the family and we always accepted his decision to get back together with her, he's a grown up and we've never tried to tell him not to be with her. During their most recent breakup (October) the drama started to involve my 8yr old. She showed up to a school event, doesn't have kids at that school. When I asked my stepson, he replied and told me \"I knew this would be a problem, she's done this before.\" This raised my concern. I told him to tell her just leave us out of it. He did, and sent me the screenshots telling her to stay away. She claimed her friend/roommate has kids that go to that school. Ok, fine. Then he calls me about a week later asking when his siblings sports practice nights are because she called him aww asking how his siblings practice is going (he described it as a taunting tone.) I asked how this girl knew what/when/where my child's sport practice was. He said he has no clue, but he was going to show up just in case she tries to \"pull some shit.\" At this point, my Mommy alarms are going off. So, we explain to our 8yo to keep an eye out and if they see this girl to alert us immediately. Of course, this scared my 8yo and we had to explain that sometimes people can be dangerous or want to cause harm and to be aware and definitely let us know if this girls shows up anywhere. They got back together a few weeks ago. He said this girl bought Christmas presents for my kids and he wants to bring her to our house in Christmas. Mind you, this girl hasn't been to our house or seen us (aside from the school event and possibly sports event) for over a yr and before that she rarely came inside when she came over, she sat in the truck while he came inside (her choice.) We asked our 8yr old and reply was \"no way, I don't want her here\" which is understandable. we told him that right now isn't a good idea, and possibly down the road we can revisit. I just don't think it's right that we just had to explain to our 8yr old to watch out for this person, then turn around and say oh it's ok now, she has gifts for you so she's coming over on Christmas even though you said you don't want her here. Of course, Stepson said we jumped the gun before we knew anything about the situation and he won't come if she can't come (he's always invited and very much loved.) He also said we're being stupid about this and of course his father is a horrible person.

She got everyone presents, and I think it\u2019s a safe bet she knows what 8yo likes!\u201d\n\nHelllll no. Protect your children from this unhinged train wreck, and clearly your step son can not be trusted to protect his little sister.", "NTA, go with your instincts on this one. If the girlfriend was dangerous enough to \u201cwatch out for\u201d recently, that risk hasn\u2019t just disappeared just because she\u2019s (probably temporarily, from the sounds of their previous history) back in your stepson\u2019s life. \n\nAlso good to set the example for your younger kids that sketchy people don\u2019t suddenly become non-sketchy as long as they bring gifts. Stay strong, OP. Your stepson is going to have to get over this.", "NTA op. Your stepson shouldn't have let it get to that concerning point in the first place. This woman is somehow using the siblings in her games with your stepson already. Don't give her even more power to do so. Tell him you'll miss him this year and hopefully you'll see him next year since this is his choice.", "NTA. You're a good mother, and following your gut on this is the right call. Plus, it was a house decision, your 8yo involved. The girl sounds like a walking red flag, and your step son is never going to willingly cut her from his life completely. She's visited before, but stayed in the car. Gave you no ground for trust, and now trying to invite herself into your home with gifts and 'good intentions' is fishy. If your step son is happy in this relationship (even though he clearly isn't) he can stay with her for the holidays, and it's no skin off your nose. He's an adult and can decide for himself. Like he did with getting back with her over and over. They're stuck on a broken record, but that doesn't mean you should endanger your family by placing blind trust into her, just because step son says so.", "NTA and you have every right to be concerned. His GF sounds like a bad movie waiting to happen. I would also notify the school", "NTA \n\nShe sounds unhinged and downright scary to be around.", "NTA \n\nStrange behavior and you don't know her well enough to invite her over - especially when your 8 year old feels uncomfortable. \n\nI say you explain that the 8 yr old doesn't feel comfortable and Christmas is for the kids, but maybe invite the two of them out so you can get to know her better ? \n\nMost of the behavior and what you've heard about her is negative, and your older son is largely responsible for that. But, that doesn't mean that you can't meet her at a different time&place \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, and would almost have law enforcement involved.\n\nHer showing up to your 8 year old's school unannounced and without permission is entirely inappropriate and frankly troubling.\n\nThat does not demonstrate trustworthy behavior or judgement, nor does she need to be in your home around young kids to cause drama.\n\nFrankly, a restraining order doesn't seem out of line.", "NTA. Given her past creepy behavior, I wouldn't want her around either. If stepson doesn't want to attend without her, I get it. He wants to be with his SO on the holiday and that's legit. But that doesn't give him the right to bring creepy people around his family either.", "NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to let anyone in your house you don\u2019t want to. That being said\u2026 it feels like your stepson isn\u2019t giving you all the info. I\u2019ve dated guys who would string me along and allude to wanting me at events, so I would go, and then they would act like I was some stalker when their friends or family would point out how weird it was that I was there, but didn\u2019t come WITH the guy. I feel like we don\u2019t have the full story. But even so, you\u2019re NTA. And good for you for letting your 8yo set that boundary and being respectful of it.", "NTA. Safe adults don't behave this way around children, and you're teaching your daughter that. Even if I don't jump to a sinister conclusion, at the very least it sounds like she's trying to ingrain herself in the younger kids' lives to try and keep her relationship with your son. That's creepy and toxic. Definitely keep her away.", "2 words: Restraining Order.", "Nope. NTA. This lady is not stable, and their relationship is a mess. She has already shown she's not afraid to use other people, kid people, in the quest of whatever it is she's doing in the relationship. So no. Either stepson comes solo, or he and GF can have a happy christmas on their own.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" and he won't come if she can't come\".. So he is a good partner, and is handling you AHs well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrepare to get old and die alone.", "I won't die alone, lol. But, you suggest I let her come over regardless of her behaviour towards a young child? Even though the young one is uncomfortable with her being here after what happened so recently? I genuinely want to hear your thoughts on this. I want him to come over, as much as he wants. I just don't want her to come in with him. She never has before, so why should this time be different?", "He\u2019s a great partner who paints his GF as a danger to small children, that low bar is tripping people in Hell.", "Do not listen to this person , follow your  gut.. if stepson wants to have a shit show relationship so be but you ( and your kids ) don\u2019t have to be in the circus.", "NTA but i think you know that. safety first.", "NTA\n\nI think you are setting a great example for your 8 y/o by not allowing her to come to your family's Christmas gathering after y'all have already explained the situation to your kid. I feel it's important for your kids to see that bad/weird actions are not ok and that if they ever feel a situation is uncomfortable or has a bad vibe, to stay away from it and be hesitant in the future.\n\nDefinitely think there may be some manipulation going on by the gf on the stepson. He even had weird feelings about what she was doing at one point in the story so how did he flip it around on you and his father so quickly? Coincidence? I think not.", "In agreement. My ex and I had a big breakup before we got married. He told his family (none of whom I really knew at the time) that we broke up because I was \u201cpsycho.\u201d Made things very awkward when we got back together. Once I found out why, I insisted he fess up and tell the truth. Ended up having a great relationship with all of my in-laws.", "NTA.", "NTA", "Stepson ignores all her suspicious behavior when he is lured back into the relationship. They will break up again soon."]}
