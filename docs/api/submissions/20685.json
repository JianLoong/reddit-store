It\u2019s caused obvious problems in the past but we have worked through it. \n\nThe last 2years we have been able to move on & coexist really well within my family bc I thought it was understood what our dynamic is supposed to be.\r  \nLast week he texted me asking if I wanted to meet up & get coffee.

We have a history of getting into it & I don\u2019t want to put myself in any situation where that could happen again, 2. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to be hanging out with my sister\u2019s husband by ourselves, and 3. I don\u2019t particularly like him & we have legitimately nothing in common so it just doesn\u2019t feel natural for us to hangout. \r  \r  \n I told him that while I appreciate his offer, I don\u2019t think we need to hangout. I said it doesn't feel like an appropriate relationship to have with an in-law IMO & things have been good lately so I don\u2019t think we need to make this relationship any deeper & risk messing anything up. \r  \n  \nHe was so upset with me & said that he will need to \u201creflect and think about how this will impact things moving forward bc I cannot accept a sort of false reality where we pretend things are good when they are not.\u201d He said he will be setting a new boundary with me & now my family is really worried he is going to withhold my nephews from me as \u2018punishment.\u2019 (Yes he\u2019s that type)\r  \n  \nI just wanted to set a clear boundary of what I am comfortable with & I don\u2019t think I should feel any sort of obligation to hangout with him just bc he got married into my family.\r\n\r  \nI\u2019d also like to add I have 5 other siblings that he has never asked to hangout with alone, only me. AND I have a SIL who has been a part of my family for 9 years now, who I adore her, but we\u2019ve only ever spent alone time together less than 3 times. \r  \n\r\nIt\u2019s now turned into a big problem between me & my sister bc I refused to spend time with her husband. I told her this was my attempt at keeping the peace & meant no harm by it. \n\nI shared with her that I would feel more comfortable if we went through her if there are any future problems between him and I & she told me she does not want to be in the middle.\r  \r  \nI made it clear that this does not mean I have any issues with him, I just want us to continue to maintain our relationship the way it is & grow from there. \n\nHanging out individually is not something I am comfortable with & I was trying to set a boundary with him. AITA for not wanting to hangout with my sister\u2019s husband alone?\n\nEdit: We\u2019ve met several times to discuss \u2018our problems\u2019 and it alway just comes down to being fundamentally different. He also is constantly trying to convert me to his beliefs and blaming me for our issues when I won\u2019t budge. I\u2019m not mad but I don\u2019t want to engage or put myself in another situation like that.\n\nEdit x2: A lot of people have suggested him possibly wanting a romantic relationship with me and I can say with confidence that is not the vibe at all.

I can't think of a good reason for you to hang out with your BIL alone without your spouses or your nephews there and if you are getting a bad vibe, usually trusting your gut is best.", "NTA i think it\u2019s super weird that your sister \u2018doesn\u2019t want to be in the middle\u2019 like she should be meditating.", "NTA. You're just not into him, and that should be allowed. Your sister picked him out, not you. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with a sister and her BIL hanging out if they have that sort of relationship, but you don't have that kind, and don't want that kind, and that should be ok. \n\nMaybe ask your sister what he even wanted to talk about.", "NTA \n\nHe sounds like a master manipulator and his attempt to withhold your nephews unless you fold to his will is abusive.  Steer clear.", "NTA\n\nIt was fine for him to offer, but I don't look to hang out one on one with other people's husband's either.  Like if you're my friend in addition to being someone's husband, that's one thing.  But if our relationship is \"You're married to someone I love\", then I don't generally see the need to hang out when your spouse isn't there.  And you declined politely enough.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with not being interested in getting to know him as more than an in-law.  Cool if you were interested in deeping that relationship, but it's also perfectly fine to keep things where they are at.  You don't have to want to be besties with everyone.", "Nta.  He feels he has the right to set boundaries but you do not have the right to set your own boundaries.  There is something off here with this guy. Keep your distance.  You owe him nothing.  He sounds very creepy and I would not trust him or agree to be alone e with him.", "NTA, why do you all need to hang out 1:1 if you are cordial at family events? Also 5 others siblings and you\u2019re the one he wants to bond with the most. Also he doesn\u2019t want the nephews there?? Y\u2019all don\u2019t find that suspicious???", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t listen to the incels saying Y T A because you have no obligation to hang out with someone just because they want to.

Do not be alone with him under any circumstances.", "NTA. The only time either of my brothers-in-law wanted to meet with me one on one was if they needed my van. This happened exactly once with each of them. They were buying large items as a surprise for my sisters. One-on-one time wasn't a thing. This sounds weird to me.", "NTA\n\nYou are right, it is not appropriate to hangout with your sisters husband.  He asked, you said no.", "What?  No.  NTA.  It's highly suspicous that he suddenly wants to hang out with you alone.  That in of itself would make me say no if I was in your shoes.  Your boundaries are on point, and absolutely correct.  You already know you two don't get along.  There is no reason to spend one on one time with him.  Besides it sounds like one huge recipe for disaster in more ways than one.", "NTA. It's weird that he wants to spend time with you alone. I wouldn't do it. You don't have to be best friends, you can be cordial at events and it's ok to only want that. He is not entitled to a relationship with you just because he married your sister.", "How odd and uncomfortable. NTA", "NTA\n\nYikes! I can\u2019t imagine hanging out with any of my BILs for even 5 minutes \ud83d\ude2c They are all awful!", "NTA! He sounds like someone who likes to create problems and argue for sport. If that's the case all you can do is avoid him.", "Sounds like he knew you'd say no so he'd have an excuse to \"set new boundaries\". I'm guessing he's a narcissist?", "Nta, your sister is the gate to her family, it\u2019s her job to be in the middle here, she brought him into your life..  Very bizarre request too.\n\nAlso your sister has equal say her nephews so she\u2019d have to back him in any revenge which is why he is definitely her problem not yours", "I love how you set a boundary, he then scribbles it out and blackmails you  with his new super secret squirrel boundary. \n\nLet him set it, then agree to see him alone *if* he signs off (in writing) on your War and Peace sized list of topics and behaviors that are not to be talked about our done. And send it to the family GC so everyone knows what's going on. \n\nNTA there is no hate like Christian love", "NTA. \n\nHonestly, if you don\u2019t vibe with someone that\u2019s okay. Some people have developed this weird idea that everyone has to be friends with everyone. \n\nAs long as y\u2019all are cordial like you\u2019ve said then there really shouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "NTA.

Regardless it sounds like he wants to meet one-on-one to try to bend your will and see things his way. Even if I'm wrong about what the fundamental differences are, you're not obligated to be besties with every in-law you have. I don't see anything wrong with a woman theoretically hanging out solo with her BIL, but I understand why you don't want to. You're entitled to your own opinions and he's going to have to live with that.", "NTA, he doesn't want his wife there, he doesn't want his sons there, he's only reaching out to a younger sibling who doesn't bend to his will? This seems sus to me", "NTA", "NTA given your history, but hanging out alone with an BIL/SIL of any gender isn\u2019t necessarily inappropriate or weird. I have a big family and have plenty of one-on-one time with my in laws, but we\u2019re comfortable with it. It\u2019s ok if you\u2019re not, i just want to make it clear that it\u2019s not inappropriate. You\u2019re family", "NTA. BIL sounds like a creepy creep.", "NTA. Super weird. I would never go for coffee alone with my BIL.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve never socialized with any of my siblings\u2019 spouses 1-on-1. It sounds like this dude just can\u2019t rest until you admit he\u2019s right about everything. Sounds exhausting and toxic.", "Nta and that's weird. I've known my brother in law since we were 12. In nearly two decades of marriage plus childhood/adolescence I've never once hung out with him one on one beyond stuff like picking him up from the airport. And I actually like the guy! Amnesty is all you're going for and if you have reached that then why mess it up.", "NTA, That situation seems so uncomfortable.   I wonder why he feels that he needs this?  It's not for you, it's for him.  Guilt? Power? Control?", "NTA \n\nHonestly, it sounded to me like he wants more than a brother/sister-in-law relationship.   Has he ever indicated that he might want a romantic relationship, or if anything in his beliefs, say it's OK for a man to have more than one woman?\n\nStick to your boundary.  Don't  spend any time with this man unless another family is present.", "NTA. \n\nPersonally I see nothing wrong with hanging out with an in law alone. Once you\u2019re married, you\u2019re literally family. But if you\u2019re not comfortable, thats not a bad thing.\n\nHowever, it sounds like maybe he wants to fix the relationship. Maybe he wanted to get coffee with you so the two of you could talk through your problems. It sounds like he\u2019s sick of the fake civility and wants to have an actual relationship. That doesn\u2019t make him an AH, either.\n\nEdit: this was pre-edit for additional information, so vote goes from NAH to NTA", "It sounds to me like he's trying to reach out to you to solve the issues you have.  Perhaps with your sister's encouragement.  It must be hard for her that you don't get along.  I certainly agree you are entitled to your boundaries but I'm not sure why you're not willing to even try.  So I'm going with YTA>", "YTA. There\u2019s no info in this post that suggests you feel unsafe meeting your BIL in a coffee shop or something, you just don\u2019t want to put in the effort. You\u2019re allowed to set boundaries, but setting a firm, \u201cI have no interest in getting to know you better,\u201d boundary with your sister\u2019s spouse just because you don\u2019t like him is a guarantee of future family strife.

We don\u2019t necessarily see eye to eye on everything but the banter is enjoyable. \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being close to sibs in-law.

I don't think he's looking for that.  He is looking for power over you.  That is scary.", "NTA. It seems like your BIL takes you having different beliefs to his own as a personal attack on his character.

He won't accept less than getting what he wants. I bet he's also very narcissistic as well and can't stand the thought of someone not liking him.

Unless she's controlled too of course.\n\nObviously, your comfort level doesn't matter to this guy and he's not mature enough to accept a polite no at face value.\n\nGood luck dealing with him at family gatherings.

That is the power to make misogynistic, racist, bigoted, etc men expose themselves.  For whatever reason, there are women that exist that make these men immediately show their true colors.

Based on you saying he's the type to withhold the kids from events, he likely wanted to get coffee to either start something or he thought he could gaslight/manipulate you into doing what he wants; ie taking the blame for any small slight he thinks happened and demanding the right to dictate your behavior in future. \n\nHe sounds like he has a personality disorder and is likely, at the very least, emotionally abusing your sister. \n\nIf he REALLY wants to find common ground then he'd agree to meeting with a neutral mediator, but he probably won't because its not on his terms.", "NTA. It's giving Ken and Barbie killers vibe. As long as you aren't being mean or belittling his feelings are not your problem.

For all the \u201cYTA\u201d individuals: they haven\u2019t even met and this guy is already instigating some sort of conflict.

I love them like actual siblings but we are way different ages, have way different interests and are just generally in different places in life. I can have conversations with them 1 v 1 at a family event and totally get along. \n\nYou do not seem to really have that kind of relationship though and have described quite a bit of tension between the two of you. It\u2019s not weird or offensive at all that you don\u2019t expect or don\u2019t want to have a bond like that with him. You guys are allowed to have differing opinions while remaining civil but not being best friends. He\u2019s 30, he should realize that as an adult and respect your decision.

And if you said yes, he could have then lied about what happened when you met and create drama. \n\nI think you need to involve all of your siblings into this, not just your sister. Yes, it's her husband, but they all should be saying why is is like this with you and why is he so set in meeting with you specifically, but not with anyone else. \n\nIf he wants to withhold your nephews, as sad as it may be, let him.

He\u2019s not only married, he\u2019s married to your sister.   Your role with him is that if both of you are amicable, you can enjoy light conversation in a family setting, then go your separate ways and live your own lives.

I am possibly being extremely biased but it just seems really weird to want to meet alone. Typically people hardcore in their faith don\u2019t seek out the opposite sex alone. Group settings, sure. If it were religious I would expect him to urge your sister or broker a meeting with a female from his congregation. \n\nThe faith thing seems like a righteous excuse to save face for whatever the hell he actually wants.  \n\nUNLESS he was always going to just leverage your nephews as a means to convert you, in attempt to insulate your sister and her children away from anyone not in the faith.
