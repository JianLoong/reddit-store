It\u2019s caused obvious problems in the past but we have worked through it. \n\nThe last 2years we have been able to move on & coexist really well within my family bc I thought it was understood what our dynamic is supposed to be.\r  \nLast week he texted me asking if I wanted to meet up & get coffee.

We have a history of getting into it & I don\u2019t want to put myself in any situation where that could happen again, 2. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to be hanging out with my sister\u2019s husband by ourselves, and 3. I don\u2019t particularly like him & we have legitimately nothing in common so it just doesn\u2019t feel natural for us to hangout. \r  \r  \n I told him that while I appreciate his offer, I don\u2019t think we need to hangout. I said it doesn't feel like an appropriate relationship to have with an in-law IMO & things have been good lately so I don\u2019t think we need to make this relationship any deeper & risk messing anything up. \r  \n  \nHe was so upset with me & said that he will need to \u201creflect and think about how this will impact things moving forward bc I cannot accept a sort of false reality where we pretend things are good when they are not.\u201d He said he will be setting a new boundary with me & now my family is really worried he is going to withhold my nephews from me as \u2018punishment.\u2019 (Yes he\u2019s that type)\r  \n  \nI just wanted to set a clear boundary of what I am comfortable with & I don\u2019t think I should feel any sort of obligation to hangout with him just bc he got married into my family.\r\n\r  \nI\u2019d also like to add I have 5 other siblings that he has never asked to hangout with alone, only me. AND I have a SIL who has been a part of my family for 9 years now, who I adore her, but we\u2019ve only ever spent alone time together less than 3 times. \r  \n\r\nIt\u2019s now turned into a big problem between me & my sister bc I refused to spend time with her husband. I told her this was my attempt at keeping the peace & meant no harm by it. \n\nI shared with her that I would feel more comfortable if we went through her if there are any future problems between him and I & she told me she does not want to be in the middle.\r  \r  \nI made it clear that this does not mean I have any issues with him, I just want us to continue to maintain our relationship the way it is & grow from there. \n\nHanging out individually is not something I am comfortable with & I was trying to set a boundary with him. AITA for not wanting to hangout with my sister\u2019s husband alone?\n\nEdit: We\u2019ve met several times to discuss \u2018our problems\u2019 and it alway just comes down to being fundamentally different. He also is constantly trying to convert me to his beliefs and blaming me for our issues when I won\u2019t budge. I\u2019m not mad but I don\u2019t want to engage or put myself in another situation like that.\n\nEdit x2: A lot of people have suggested him possibly wanting a romantic relationship with me and I can say with confidence that is not the vibe at all.

I can't think of a good reason for you to hang out with your BIL alone without your spouses or your nephews there and if you are getting a bad vibe, usually trusting your gut is best.", "NTA i think it\u2019s super weird that your sister \u2018doesn\u2019t want to be in the middle\u2019 like she should be meditating.", "NTA. You're just not into him, and that should be allowed. Your sister picked him out, not you. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with a sister and her BIL hanging out if they have that sort of relationship, but you don't have that kind, and don't want that kind, and that should be ok. \n\nMaybe ask your sister what he even wanted to talk about.", "NTA \n\nHe sounds like a master manipulator and his attempt to withhold your nephews unless you fold to his will is abusive.  Steer clear.", "NTA\n\nIt was fine for him to offer, but I don't look to hang out one on one with other people's husband's either.  Like if you're my friend in addition to being someone's husband, that's one thing.  But if our relationship is \"You're married to someone I love\", then I don't generally see the need to hang out when your spouse isn't there.  And you declined politely enough.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with not being interested in getting to know him as more than an in-law.  Cool if you were interested in deeping that relationship, but it's also perfectly fine to keep things where they are at.  You don't have to want to be besties with everyone.", "Nta.  He feels he has the right to set boundaries but you do not have the right to set your own boundaries.  There is something off here with this guy. Keep your distance.  You owe him nothing.  He sounds very creepy and I would not trust him or agree to be alone e with him.", "NTA, why do you all need to hang out 1:1 if you are cordial at family events? Also 5 others siblings and you\u2019re the one he wants to bond with the most. Also he doesn\u2019t want the nephews there?? Y\u2019all don\u2019t find that suspicious???", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t listen to the incels saying Y T A because you have no obligation to hang out with someone just because they want to.

Do not be alone with him under any circumstances.", "NTA. The only time either of my brothers-in-law wanted to meet with me one on one was if they needed my van. This happened exactly once with each of them. They were buying large items as a surprise for my sisters. One-on-one time wasn't a thing. This sounds weird to me.", "NTA\n\nYou are right, it is not appropriate to hangout with your sisters husband.  He asked, you said no.", "What?  No.  NTA.  It's highly suspicous that he suddenly wants to hang out with you alone.  That in of itself would make me say no if I was in your shoes.  Your boundaries are on point, and absolutely correct.  You already know you two don't get along.  There is no reason to spend one on one time with him.  Besides it sounds like one huge recipe for disaster in more ways than one.", "NTA. It's weird that he wants to spend time with you alone. I wouldn't do it. You don't have to be best friends, you can be cordial at events and it's ok to only want that. He is not entitled to a relationship with you just because he married your sister.", "How odd and uncomfortable. NTA", "NTA\n\nYikes! I can\u2019t imagine hanging out with any of my BILs for even 5 minutes \ud83d\ude2c They are all awful!", "NTA! He sounds like someone who likes to create problems and argue for sport. If that's the case all you can do is avoid him.", "Sounds like he knew you'd say no so he'd have an excuse to \"set new boundaries\". I'm guessing he's a narcissist?", "Nta, your sister is the gate to her family, it\u2019s her job to be in the middle here, she brought him into your life..  Very bizarre request too.\n\nAlso your sister has equal say her nephews so she\u2019d have to back him in any revenge which is why he is definitely her problem not yours", "I love how you set a boundary, he then scribbles it out and blackmails you  with his new super secret squirrel boundary. \n\nLet him set it, then agree to see him alone *if* he signs off (in writing) on your War and Peace sized list of topics and behaviors that are not to be talked about our done. And send it to the family GC so everyone knows what's going on. \n\nNTA there is no hate like Christian love", "NTA. \n\nHonestly, if you don\u2019t vibe with someone that\u2019s okay. Some people have developed this weird idea that everyone has to be friends with everyone. \n\nAs long as y\u2019all are cordial like you\u2019ve said then there really shouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "NTA.

Regardless it sounds like he wants to meet one-on-one to try to bend your will and see things his way. Even if I'm wrong about what the fundamental differences are, you're not obligated to be besties with every in-law you have. I don't see anything wrong with a woman theoretically hanging out solo with her BIL, but I understand why you don't want to. You're entitled to your own opinions and he's going to have to live with that.", "NTA, he doesn't want his wife there, he doesn't want his sons there, he's only reaching out to a younger sibling who doesn't bend to his will? This seems sus to me", "NTA", "NTA given your history, but hanging out alone with an BIL/SIL of any gender isn\u2019t necessarily inappropriate or weird. I have a big family and have plenty of one-on-one time with my in laws, but we\u2019re comfortable with it. It\u2019s ok if you\u2019re not, i just want to make it clear that it\u2019s not inappropriate. You\u2019re family", "NTA. BIL sounds like a creepy creep.", "NTA. Super weird. I would never go for coffee alone with my BIL.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve never socialized with any of my siblings\u2019 spouses 1-on-1. It sounds like this dude just can\u2019t rest until you admit he\u2019s right about everything. Sounds exhausting and toxic.", "Nta and that's weird. I've known my brother in law since we were 12. In nearly two decades of marriage plus childhood/adolescence I've never once hung out with him one on one beyond stuff like picking him up from the airport. And I actually like the guy! Amnesty is all you're going for and if you have reached that then why mess it up.", "NTA, That situation seems so uncomfortable.   I wonder why he feels that he needs this?  It's not for you, it's for him.  Guilt? Power? Control?", "NTA \n\nHonestly, it sounded to me like he wants more than a brother/sister-in-law relationship.   Has he ever indicated that he might want a romantic relationship, or if anything in his beliefs, say it's OK for a man to have more than one woman?\n\nStick to your boundary.  Don't  spend any time with this man unless another family is present.", "NTA. \n\nPersonally I see nothing wrong with hanging out with an in law alone. Once you\u2019re married, you\u2019re literally family. But if you\u2019re not comfortable, thats not a bad thing.\n\nHowever, it sounds like maybe he wants to fix the relationship. Maybe he wanted to get coffee with you so the two of you could talk through your problems. It sounds like he\u2019s sick of the fake civility and wants to have an actual relationship. That doesn\u2019t make him an AH, either.\n\nEdit: this was pre-edit for additional information, so vote goes from NAH to NTA", "It sounds to me like he's trying to reach out to you to solve the issues you have.  Perhaps with your sister's encouragement.  It must be hard for her that you don't get along.  I certainly agree you are entitled to your boundaries but I'm not sure why you're not willing to even try.  So I'm going with YTA>", "YTA. There\u2019s no info in this post that suggests you feel unsafe meeting your BIL in a coffee shop or something, you just don\u2019t want to put in the effort. You\u2019re allowed to set boundaries, but setting a firm, \u201cI have no interest in getting to know you better,\u201d boundary with your sister\u2019s spouse just because you don\u2019t like him is a guarantee of future family strife.

I have brothers in law I adore, and they've never insisted on alone time with me. Some have been in my life since I was a small child.\n\nAlso, your sister *is* \"the middle\". She's literally the only link between the two of you.", "NTA.  He can't let go that you won't convert to his beliefs.  Zealots are like that.  Say it directly that you don't want a relationship where all he does is try to proselytize you.  He's going to distance the kids from you regardless.", "NTA. I really like my in laws and we get along well when we all hang out as a family, but I have no desire to hang out with them outside of with my nilbings and/or siblings and would be surprised if they ever asked.\nIt's really weird to me that this guy would be so intense about having to be friends with each other. You can be polite without having to \"fake\" positivity. \nAlso a great pro tip I recently heard: if he brings up any intense things while you're around family, you can exclaim \"what a bizarre statement to bring up whilst we're sitting here eating/at a birthday/hanging out\" and move on the conversation.", "NTA It might not be romantic but he is wanting something. Weather it's to try and convert you or set up something else. Your sister should shut this down immediately. The fact that she doesn't see this as over stepping your boundaries is concerning. If your parents are still in the picture I would let them know that these meetings are not going to happen now or ever and they need to get your sister on board with that also. He seems very controlling and maybe thinks you need to be controlled since you are a single female. I would stand very firm. If he brings having contact with nephew into this, do not give in. This is manipulation. If he is willing to use his child to get what he wants then face the fact that you won't have that much time with nephew.", "NTA. He sounds creepy. I know you said he doesn\u2019t want a romantic relationship, so I won\u2019t go that route but you can be creepy in other ways.

My husband has one brother.  I\u2019ve been married 26 years, my older sister longer than that, my younger sister a little bit less but she\u2019s had two husbands.  My husband\u2019s brother got married the same year we did just a month later than us, so in over two and half decades I cannot think of any time, ever, that I\u2019ve been alone with any of my BIL\u2019s one on one.  My older sister\u2019s husband once dropped me off at my hotel when my younger sister got married, but even then, my nephews were with him.\n\nI\u2019d find it really weird if any of them asked me out for coffee for one-on-one time.  I\u2019d call either sister and ask WTH was up before agreeing to anything.  Unless any of the BILs specifically said it was to plan a surprise party for my sisters or husband or something and even that can be a fucking phone call.  \n\nYour sister sounds completely unhelpful and your BIL unhinged.  \n\nAlso, if he can get your compliance by withholding the nephews on this, he will just use that cudgel on you whenever he feels like he needs to make you conform to his wishes.  Everything about this is scary and sus as all get out.  I would not only never spend alone time with this man, I would wonder about anyone who says it is normal that he is asking this as your BIL.\n\nIf this man ever does get you alone, please record the interaction on your phone, every single time.  Trust me on this, you will need to do so, but the best way to proceed is to just not meet him one on one and tell your sister that you have no intention of hanging out with this man as YOU are not married to him.  You would never have chosen this person to be in your life and polite kindness is more than enough to meet the demands of being a sister-in-law.\n\nYour sister should be handling this.  \n\nShe thrust this man into your life whether you wanted him there or not.  You are polite and that is all you need to be.  If he wants more than that, your sister needs to find out why and tell him to stop, not you.  The fact that she won\u2019t is really problematic.  She already forced you to even know this man, the least she could is grow a spine and keep him from harassing you.  WTH is WRONG with her, anyway?", "Absolutely NTA.  I don\u2019t know WTH he is trying to do, but I trust your gut that it\u2019s no bueno.  I have had four  BILs in my life and not a one tried to force me to spend alone time.

So red flag no. 2 -  incongruence. \n\nThird red flag is that an invitation to coffee (probably precipitated by some escalation of the issue) is reframed by op as an obligation to \u201chang out\u201d, rather than exactly what he said it was - to find common ground (also indicating there are unresolved issues)  red flag three - exaggeration.\n\n(Note she also says she \u201cadores\u201d her sister in law who she has hung out with one on one once every three years)\n\nRed flag number four: passive aggressive behaviour - instead of saying \u201cno I don\u2019t want to because I don\u2019t like you\u201d upon being invited, she tries to \u201cdeflect\u201d by trying to bring her sisters kids into the whole  thing. Using kiddies as shields. Then uses this as further justification for why her BIL is an AH, when his whole intention was to talk with her.\n\nShe actually sounds like a nightmare imo. She obviously doesn\u2019t like him but doesn\u2019t have the courage to say it. Instead she\u2019s trying to manipulate her family into believing that the BIL has done something wrong, other than being dislike by her.", "No contest imo. The married person is a lot more likely to take \"no\" for an answer.", "She also says he tries to push his beliefs into her and they disagree fundamentally on these beliefs. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to think he wants to meet to continue pushing his views on her and she\u2019s not obligated to listen to that. I think it\u2019s fair for her to want to keep her distance in order to maintain peace.", "I dunno, I mean she levels a lot of accusations but provides no explanation\u2026 that\u2019s why I think there\u2019s a fair bit more to this story than op is letting kn."]}
