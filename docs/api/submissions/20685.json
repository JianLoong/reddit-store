I can't think of a good reason for you to hang out with your BIL alone without your spouses or your nephews there and if you are getting a bad vibe, usually trusting your gut is best.", "NTA i think it\u2019s super weird that your sister \u2018doesn\u2019t want to be in the middle\u2019 like she should be meditating.", "NTA. You're just not into him, and that should be allowed. Your sister picked him out, not you. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with a sister and her BIL hanging out if they have that sort of relationship, but you don't have that kind, and don't want that kind, and that should be ok. \n\nMaybe ask your sister what he even wanted to talk about.", "NTA \n\nHe sounds like a master manipulator and his attempt to withhold your nephews unless you fold to his will is abusive.  Steer clear.", "NTA\n\nIt was fine for him to offer, but I don't look to hang out one on one with other people's husband's either.  Like if you're my friend in addition to being someone's husband, that's one thing.  But if our relationship is \"You're married to someone I love\", then I don't generally see the need to hang out when your spouse isn't there.  And you declined politely enough.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with not being interested in getting to know him as more than an in-law.  Cool if you were interested in deeping that relationship, but it's also perfectly fine to keep things where they are at.  You don't have to want to be besties with everyone.", "Nta.  He feels he has the right to set boundaries but you do not have the right to set your own boundaries.  There is something off here with this guy. Keep your distance.  You owe him nothing.  He sounds very creepy and I would not trust him or agree to be alone e with him.", "NTA, why do you all need to hang out 1:1 if you are cordial at family events? Also 5 others siblings and you\u2019re the one he wants to bond with the most. Also he doesn\u2019t want the nephews there?? Y\u2019all don\u2019t find that suspicious???", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t listen to the incels saying Y T A because you have no obligation to hang out with someone just because they want to. No means no whether it\u2019s opposite sex, familial, or strangers. \n\nIf he\u2019s going to prevent you from seeing his kids because of that so be it.", "NTA. This dude is being sus. Do not be alone with him under any circumstances.", "NTA. The only time either of my brothers-in-law wanted to meet with me one on one was if they needed my van. This happened exactly once with each of them. They were buying large items as a surprise for my sisters. One-on-one time wasn't a thing. This sounds weird to me.", "NTA\n\nYou are right, it is not appropriate to hangout with your sisters husband.  He asked, you said no.", "What?  No.  NTA.  It's highly suspicous that he suddenly wants to hang out with you alone.  That in of itself would make me say no if I was in your shoes.  Your boundaries are on point, and absolutely correct.  You already know you two don't get along.  There is no reason to spend one on one time with him.  Besides it sounds like one huge recipe for disaster in more ways than one.", "NTA. It's weird that he wants to spend time with you alone. I wouldn't do it. You don't have to be best friends, you can be cordial at events and it's ok to only want that. He is not entitled to a relationship with you just because he married your sister.", "How odd and uncomfortable. NTA", "NTA\n\nYikes! I can\u2019t imagine hanging out with any of my BILs for even 5 minutes \ud83d\ude2c They are all awful!", "NTA! He sounds like someone who likes to create problems and argue for sport. If that's the case all you can do is avoid him.", "Sounds like he knew you'd say no so he'd have an excuse to \"set new boundaries\". I'm guessing he's a narcissist?", "Nta, your sister is the gate to her family, it\u2019s her job to be in the middle here, she brought him into your life..  Very bizarre request too.\n\nAlso your sister has equal say her nephews so she\u2019d have to back him in any revenge which is why he is definitely her problem not yours", "I love how you set a boundary, he then scribbles it out and blackmails you  with his new super secret squirrel boundary. \n\nLet him set it, then agree to see him alone *if* he signs off (in writing) on your War and Peace sized list of topics and behaviors that are not to be talked about our done. And send it to the family GC so everyone knows what's going on. \n\nNTA there is no hate like Christian love", "NTA. \n\nHonestly, if you don\u2019t vibe with someone that\u2019s okay. Some people have developed this weird idea that everyone has to be friends with everyone. \n\nAs long as y\u2019all are cordial like you\u2019ve said then there really shouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "NTA. Everything he is saying is manipulative. He does not want to \"connect and find common ground\" he wants to berate you into what he wants.", "NTA\n\nIf I had to guess, he's very religious (and you're not) and/or has a different political alignment than you and is very vocal about it. Regardless it sounds like he wants to meet one-on-one to try to bend your will and see things his way. Even if I'm wrong about what the fundamental differences are, you're not obligated to be besties with every in-law you have. I don't see anything wrong with a woman theoretically hanging out solo with her BIL, but I understand why you don't want to. You're entitled to your own opinions and he's going to have to live with that.", "NTA, he doesn't want his wife there, he doesn't want his sons there, he's only reaching out to a younger sibling who doesn't bend to his will? This seems sus to me", "NTA", "NTA given your history, but hanging out alone with an BIL/SIL of any gender isn\u2019t necessarily inappropriate or weird. I have a big family and have plenty of one-on-one time with my in laws, but we\u2019re comfortable with it. It\u2019s ok if you\u2019re not, i just want to make it clear that it\u2019s not inappropriate. You\u2019re family", "NTA. BIL sounds like a creepy creep.", "NTA. Super weird. I would never go for coffee alone with my BIL.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve never socialized with any of my siblings\u2019 spouses 1-on-1. It sounds like this dude just can\u2019t rest until you admit he\u2019s right about everything. Sounds exhausting and toxic.", "Nta and that's weird. I've known my brother in law since we were 12. In nearly two decades of marriage plus childhood/adolescence I've never once hung out with him one on one beyond stuff like picking him up from the airport. And I actually like the guy! Amnesty is all you're going for and if you have reached that then why mess it up.", "NTA, That situation seems so uncomfortable.   I wonder why he feels that he needs this?  It's not for you, it's for him.  Guilt? Power? Control?", "NTA \n\nHonestly, it sounded to me like he wants more than a brother/sister-in-law relationship.   Has he ever indicated that he might want a romantic relationship, or if anything in his beliefs, say it's OK for a man to have more than one woman?\n\nStick to your boundary.  Don't  spend any time with this man unless another family is present.", "NTA. \n\nPersonally I see nothing wrong with hanging out with an in law alone. Once you\u2019re married, you\u2019re literally family. But if you\u2019re not comfortable, thats not a bad thing.\n\nHowever, it sounds like maybe he wants to fix the relationship. Maybe he wanted to get coffee with you so the two of you could talk through your problems. It sounds like he\u2019s sick of the fake civility and wants to have an actual relationship. That doesn\u2019t make him an AH, either.\n\nEdit: this was pre-edit for additional information, so vote goes from NAH to NTA", "It sounds to me like he's trying to reach out to you to solve the issues you have.  Perhaps with your sister's encouragement.  It must be hard for her that you don't get along.  I certainly agree you are entitled to your boundaries but I'm not sure why you're not willing to even try.  So I'm going with YTA>", "YTA. There\u2019s no info in this post that suggests you feel unsafe meeting your BIL in a coffee shop or something, you just don\u2019t want to put in the effort. You\u2019re allowed to set boundaries, but setting a firm, \u201cI have no interest in getting to know you better,\u201d boundary with your sister\u2019s spouse just because you don\u2019t like him is a guarantee of future family strife. The adult thing to do is to try to work out disagreements.", "YTA.
