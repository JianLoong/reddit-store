{"id": 2382, "submission_id": "yw1h0b", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend that she's too heavy?", "selftext": "So for context, I've always been a skinny dude and the only form of exercise I do is take long walks regularly. According to my girlfriend, she is considered obese by bmi standards. She has always been insecure about her body but I always make sure to let her know I'm attracted to her and love her the way she is and feel the same when she loses and gains weight. \n\nOne day we were at an outdoor party with a lot of friends and friends of friends. She was drinking, pretty much everyone was drinking. Neither of us was completely drunk I think. In the midst of it all she came up to me and playfully asked me to pick her up. I playfully, shoved her away and jokingly told her the food in my hand was more important than her right now. \n\nShe was laughing and came back and held on to me and kept telling me to pick her up. I kept on saying \"no\" and \"get off me\". It was all playful at this point. At first she laughing and giggling but then she started whining and that's when I realized she really wanted me pick her up. \n\nI knew I couldn't do it and she knew it too. So, at this I playfully told her, \"but you're too heavy for me to pick up\". She immediately let go of me but forced a laugh and stole a piece of my food. \n\nI noticed a few people were glancing and looking all awkward probably because they heard what I said. She was quiet the way back home and she said it was because she was sleepy. \n\nBut after we woke up the next day she started crying and said I humiliated her. I told her she wouldn't stop asking me to carry her and we both know it was an impossible task. She said that I could've said it any other way.\n\nA mutual friend of ours, who I found later witnessed the whole thing and who my gf probably vented to the whole day, contacted me and said I should apologize to my gf because this really hurt her. She also said I should've said something like \"sorry babe I'm too weak\" instead of being an asshole and insulting my gf while she only wanted to have fun. I also talked to another friend of mine about this and he agreed with the mutual friend's opinion.\n\nI'm gonna sit down with my gf tonight to apologize and tell her I was wrong and try to make it up to her. I'm doing it because I know she is hurt because of it and I love her, but I do not feel like an asshole. I don't get why I have to say \"I'm too weak\" and insult myself when she is the one who wouldn't let go or stop asking me to pick her up. \n\nBoth things are true, she's heavy and I'm weak, I don't understand why everyone seems to feel like one is okay for me to say and the other isn't. I tried to be tactful and playful with how I said no in the beginning but she wouldn't let me go. \n\nSo, am I really an asshole for telling her \"you're too heavy\" in this situation?", "created_utc": 1668528421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw1h0b/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_shes_too_heavy/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's how couples can get through these things. But she should be mad at herself. Remind her that no means no, and not just for sex. She needs to listen to you and your actual words even when she in not intuitive enough to read your emotions. \n\nI mean, what did she want here? What did she think was going to happen?

People on reddit think consent only matters when a woman is denied that basic human right.", "Complicated, so going ESH.\n\nYou asked a specific question. Why should you insult yourself? Let me ask you a very clear question: Is your pride more important than your girlfriend's feelings? Let me tell you, I've been with my partner since 2004 and I can tell you I'd rather hurt my own feelings than hers any day. I'm not saying to some abusive standard, but knowing how words can hurt her, I'd never choose to do that if I have the opportunity. I'll get over it, but when your partner hits you in your insecurity, it lingers.\n\nYes, your gf shouldn't have been pushing for this. And you did try to handle it better with your food \"being more important\" to try and diffuse the conversation. I think people aren't recognizing that, but the answer you did give was incredibly hurtful. It hit her in a place she's more insecure about than you are about your strength. Do you understand that? These aren't equal \"insults.\"\n\nI'm not about to say you all have a drinking problem. People say stupid things when they're drunk but if she's this vulnerable around this issue, she needs to avoid conversations of weight and the like when she's drinking. She's an AH here for putting herself in a lose-lose situation. It would have been more embarrassing for everyone if you tried to lift her and failed, likely would have drawn more attention. And she wouldn't recognize or take your no or subtle diffusion as an answer. If this keeps up, you might want to start priming answers such as \"Oh not while we're drinking!\" Or try and create funny answers like \"You know I only pick you up if I'm putting you on a bed, and I don't see a bed right here!\" to try to bring levity into the situation that people can laugh at the joke rather than attention to weight.\n\nRegardless, you hurt her feelings. Isn't that worth apologizing over? How is this even a question? I'm baffled that guys don't realize they shouldn't hurt their partner's feelings. WTF, this is really simple relationship 101 sort of stuff.

Or maybe she was feeling bad about being overweight &wanted to humiliate you by making you feel \"weak\".  \n\nIn my opinion your girlfriend is 100% the cause of her own hurt and humiliation.  You were sitting there, minding your own business, she comes over with her nonsense and you tried to redirect the conversation several times but she insisted.\n\nSure, you can apologize for not using different words to make her stop asking you to do something she knows you cannot do.  but the real issue is why was she instigate the issue by insisting you pick her up, in front of friends, when she knows it was an impossibility?", "Soft YTA, next time say \u201cSorry but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of picking you up right now.\u201d", "Iv been the heavy girl in this situation and I'm say NTA. \n\nSit down and talk about joining dance classes or something, together than can slim her down and strengthen you up and bond in the mean time. I feel like you love each other but her weight is an issue for her. \n\nIf you were to chose to mention dance classes, concentrate on how you'd like to be strong enough to lift her at your wedding dance or something. If you'd like to obviously, but if you get her moving more, and happier! Her weight will naturally fall off and you will naturally get stronger too. :)", "NTA.\n\nMaybe you weren't tactful, but sometimes you have to be straight with people. Your girlfriend wasn't picking up your hints. As you'd both been drinking, she probably wasn't thinking straight (why she stupidly kept bugging you), and there's a chance you might have sounded unintentionally blunt. Who knows? Your girlfriend has hang-ups about her body, so for sure, she's projecting her insecurity - that's the issue rather than you. You ultimately did the right thing because it would have been far more embarrassing for your girlfriend if you tried and failed to pick her up. I think it was just one of those unfortunate mishaps where someone's feelings got hurt, but it can be resolved if you talk to one another and apologise.\n\nI definitely disagree with the friend who thought you should have said you were weak. No way! I'm a woman, and I think that's patronising and sexist to you and your girlfriend. You aren't weak because you can't pick up somebody heavier than you, even if that person is a woman. Sheesh. Edit: Also, saying this still wouldn't have helped because it would still translate to your girlfriend as, \"you're too weak because I'm heavy\".", "NTA- you made other excuses that you can't do it and then she double down and found out the truth.  She should realize that she brought this situation onto herself.", "NTA. Maybe you didn\u2019t have the perfect words and I can see why your girlfriend might be upset, but she pushed the issue and kinda walked herself right in there. But you are doing right by apologizing.", "I somehow feel that the gf would not have gotten the hint with that phrasing. You're beating around the bush. \nAlthough saying your drunk is valid excuse. Some people are pushy.", "I'm sorry but, \"owned up to being weaker\"? Why does he have to put himself down when she knew that he couldn't pick her up and kept pushing the issue? What he said was blunt and I can understand why it would have hurt her feelings but what exactly did she expect to happen? Can you imagine if he did try and pick her up and couldn't do it? How would that have been different? \n\nBc he was basically forced into the situation, I'm gonna go with NTA. Things can be said better but come on....", "Why does he have to \"own up to being weaker\" when she is the one who created the situation and kept pushing it? If he went straight to that the first time she asked, I could see that, but she's the one who kept pushing it. And he tried not saying anything at all, he tried deflecting, but she wouldn't let it go.", "\"You should allow your significant other to gaslight you into self-deprecation\"\n\nYep", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "This is the best response. \nShe shouldn't have kept pushing you, but there were a bunch of other ways to get out of this without embarrassing her (or you).", "If they are both wrong judgement should be ESH.", "It feels like he fell for a trap, so he sucks for falling for it, but she sucks for setting it. ESH it\u2019s the moral equivalent of does this make me look fat?", "Lol yeah if someone said  they\u2019re too weak to pick me up, I\u2019d 100% interpret that as \u201cbecause I\u2019m too heavy.\u201d Literally any of my female friends would have interpreted it that way. Eta: but I\u2019d also never ask someone to pick me up. I\u2019m an able bodied adult. And I don\u2019t hang around women that would act like that and haven\u2019t for years. \n\nThey mean the same thing. They\u2019re interpreted the same. Everyone saying otherwise is being silly. It was a no win situation for OP.", "She kept pushing him, so eventually he told her the truth. He repeatedly tried declining without explaining why, and she kept insisting. She forced him into that position. \n\nIf you keep publicly pushing someone to respond to something like that, you don\u2019t get to be mad when they give you the truth.", "So\u2026he wasn\u2019t saying it in a Beatles kinda way?", "Op said \u201cNO\u201d multiple times. He had to tell her to get off of him. She wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer which you acknowledge. Additionally, they both inebriated. \n\nAfter saying \u201cno\u201d multiple times, telling her to get of him, physically pushing her away from him, her not taking no for an answer, and them being intoxicated, you really believe OP saying what you said he should have said to pulsar ended it after him saying no multiple times.", "I agree. I also fear that the hollow apology planned is going to make things that much worse. \n\nTrying to make someone \"feel better\" without fully understanding matters is tricky. Even more so if it's already a sensitive issue like weight. \n\nIf you apologize know why and mean it.", "But isn't the partner hurting his feelings by forcing him to say something self deprecating about himself? Why is that ok? I can understand an ESH ruling, but it definitely isn't YTA.", "You actually will hurt your own feelings in the long run. Doesn't matter if you believe it or not, if you say something about yourself, it'll stick. That's just how brains work. \n\nNEVER say anything bad about yourself because it's just you hurting yourself and it WILL catch up to you", "but like...if she knows he can't pick her up then why ask him? as some type of weird test? what was she trying to gain by this and why did she need or want to be picked up?", "He\u2019s the Ahole for the comment.", "Our partners aren't forcing us to say or do anything. We have choices. Dude \\*knows\\* that she's insecure about her body and weight. He literally opens the story with that. So there's no way he doesn't know that saying she's too heavy for him to pick up isn't going to hurt her feelings. There were any number of ways he could have frame the issue, but he chose the one way that was guaranteed to hurt her feelings, and he did it in front of their friends. \n\nI wavered between E S H and Y T A, but, ultimately, her pestering him to pick her up sounds more mildly annoying than full on AH.", "I can\\`t pick my wife up, she knows that, I know that. If she asked me in public, at a party and persisted I would find a better way of telling her no, than telling her she is too heavy. Why? Because it would upset her feelings if I said it out loud in front of a bunch of people and I think it\\`s pretty obvious telling someone that, at a party, in front of a bunch of people is an Assholeish thing to do. The english language is full of words and phrases that don\\`t offend. He chose the ones that did.", "I mean, isn't saying \"no\" multiple times a way for him to frame the issue? What was he supposed to say that wasn't either rude to her or self deprecating to him?  \n\n\nYou wrote \"You're not going to hurt your own feelings saying something deprecating about yourself.\" This is absolutely not true. He may well be insecure about his strength, and being essentially manipulated into stating that he is weak is also not ok.", ">I wavered between E S H and Y T A, but, ultimately, her pestering him to pick her up sounds more mildly annoying than full on AH.\n\nNah, this is where you lose me. As a former fat person myself, I know the value of tact and I'm a man but would have been hurt if someone said this to me the way OP expressed it. But she knew damn well he couldn't pick her up, and she pushed him to anyway *expecting him to poke fun at his own weakness to spare her feelings.* She was forcing him into a situation where he was supposed to be self depreciating and everyone would have had a chuckle at his expense, and then got mad when he didn't respond as anticipated. He should have worded it another way, but NTA because it never should have happened in the first place.", "i completely agree and also he did say the first time that his food was more important and tried to diffuse and deflect and move on and she came back and asked again. it's honestly just a very awkward situation but i'd argue her persistence made it awkward.", "I agree. He tried to give her an out, and she continued to be weird about it. This is on her.", "It may have made it awkward but still think there is a better choice of words/actions that are significantly better then what he chose when talking to someone you apparently love.", "but the first words he chose were humorous and fine and she persisted."]}
