People have it in their mind that you are the ones who left, so it's on you to visit them. That isn't correct,but they think like that. \n\nWhat you said is correct. If they want to see your family, they can come. That is a healthy boundary. We all need to learn to set and maintain healthy boundaries with family. Watch youtubes to learn how. Make sure your husband does it with his family, too, and that you both are on the same page and have each other's backs when family starts pressuring you to do what's convenient for them. \n\nAs an experienced milso, I'm going to tell you that you should lower your expectations for the visit. Don't expect everyone to act as you would act if you were them. Be accepting of their own quirks and emotions or lack thereof. \n\nPart of your boundaries, especially with close family can be that you take turns Visiting each other or that you vacation together- at a vacation destination that you all fly to and meet up there, like a cruise. \n\nAnother great advice- Do not let them guilt you into doing what they want. Just say, \"I'm not comfortable with that.\"  Or \"That doesn't sound like an equitable compromise to me.\" \n\nIf you set your expectations too high, you will just be setting yourself up for disappointment. And, not everyone is as excited for new babies as you expect them to be, either. Keep your expectations in check. \n\nBe ready for them to do annoying things, like try to give your kids large gifts that won't fit in luggage, make thoughtless comments about the military or politics, and give you unsolicited advice. \n\nYou should already know this stuff, because this is a post made all the time on milso groups. \n\nBon voyage", "NTA we went through this early in our marriage.  A week isn't enough unless people will participate.  So we would do 1 d as y eith my family and 1 day with his, 1 day with my friends 1 day with his. If people can't come then it's their loss. Spend the rest of your time with each other", "NTA - It's your vacation and you shouldn't have to run yourself ragged running around trying to fit into everyone else's schedules, it is simply unreasonable. They have had plenty of notice, so if they want to see you and value your friendship they should be able to make the effort to come to you when you're nearby.", "NTA, it is unreasonable to expect you all to drive around to see family when you all are the ones visiting. They can make the drive to see yall, if they want to, if not, too bad", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, thank you and your husband for your service to our country as a military family. It's understandable that you want to spend some quality time with your family and reconnect with your spouse during your vacation. You are not in the wrong for setting boundaries and letting people know that you won't be able to visit everyone during your limited time off.  \nIt's important to remember that it's your vacation, and you have the right to spend it how you want. You've already made plans to visit some friends and family, and you've let everyone know your availability and location. **It's not your responsibility to cater to everyone's requests and drive long hours to visit them.**  \nFurthermore, it's unfair for people to expect you to do all the traveling and not make any effort to come to you. They should understand that you have limited time and resources, and they should be willing to meet you halfway.  \nIn conclusion, don't feel guilty for setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs during your vacation. Stick to your decision and enjoy the time with the people who make the effort to come to you.", "NTA-thank you both for your husband\u2019s service. \n\nYou probably could have handled it a little better, but you\u2019re well within your right to say no.

Plus, each invite may not know about the others (unless is a group message), so they may not realize they are taking ALL your time. Their invites aren\u2019t unkind. They are offering to host your family, which probably involves great deal of preparation if done thoughtfully. People are generally very short-sighted.", "INFO: Are you staying with some family? If so, that might be the reason others aren't inviting themselves to come to a house where you're just a guest. \n\nWhy wouldn't you plan one \"event\" and just invite others to join?", "NTA I think you made the best choice considering the circumstances. I have a close family friend who lives away from us now and when her family comes back to town, they usually send out a message letting people know that they\u2019ll be at a particular bar or park or something for a set period of time and to please join them if you\u2019d like to catch up. That leaves it up to all of us to decide whether we care enough to go and see them and allows them to spend their visiting time wisely (ie not driving around).", "NTA. I was overseas for some time so coming home was a big thing. Of course, everyone wants you to come to them. The proble is, as you know, that results in no vacation, just driving everywhere.\n\nSecond time home, I went to specific family members homes and told the wider family I would be at those houses only. Most understood. Some came. A few did say \"come drive to us, we are only an hour away\" and were a bit sad to be turned down. They knew when where I would be though, so its a two way street\n\nThird visit home I told no one and just enjoyed myself. Gave a parents and siblings a surprise visit. Everyone got pissy when they later found out I was back, but downtime is important. they got over it. \n\nTotally NTA subby.

My experience was being stationed in germany for my entire contract and when I would go home on leave I would go for like 3 to 4 weeks at a time because I was on another continent and travel was expensive.

So I get it and people who demand this should be informed of the hardship they are asking and weather you inform them in a nice way or the fun way.

You are traveling a lot, with your kids, and have limited time and a wedding to go to.  They can all come to you, and if not, you'll see them next time.", "NTA as someone who has been there, done that. It gets old. I traveled 10hrs back home and you can't drive 30 mins to me? OK \ud83e\udee0", "NTA\n\nThey are trying to take away the \"vacation\" part of your vacation. You are not obligated to drive and see every Tom, Dick and Harry that misses you. You need some rest and relaxation on your vacation. Driving everywhere isn't going to do that for you and they need to understand. If they can't make it to where you are at, then they just won't see you. It's not a big deal. Disappointing yes, but not the end of the world.", "NTA - I live 1200 miles from a good bit of my family and my wife's family.\n\nI let them know when we're coming and that if we can drive 1200 miles to be in the same state then they can drive the 125 miles to my vacation location.", "NTA\n\nI hope you are not Filipino.  Because if you are, not only are you expected to go out of your way to visit them, you are also expected to take them (and their random family members you've never heard off) out to dinner.  And yes, I am Filipino.", "NTA", "NTA my wife and I live on the other side of the country from our families. I swear it feels like I spend my whole summer either driving or sitting in a random relative's living room.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, thank you for your family\u2019s service. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s serving but I appreciate you guys.\n\nSecond, I\u2019ve been a military brat my whole life. So, my family has experienced this *exact* scenario. Every trip to see relatives quickly becomes tiresome. Sure, some trips are surprise visits. HOWEVER, most people know where we stay and most live in the same city as where we\u2019re temporarily staying.\n\nWe can make exceptions for the elderly and people experiencing financial hardships. But we know how the rest feel when they put the responsibility on us to always come see them.\n\nBecause of that, we\u2019ve all reached a point of deciding to not go above and beyond like before. If we don\u2019t want to be exhausted and immediately hate the trip, then we won\u2019t drive all around to see everybody. And you should do the same too.", "NTA\n\n\"Sorry, it won't be possible for us to travel the extra distance to be sit you at your home.  We're only in Town for a week and already have multiple days planned out and can't accomodations everyone's desire to have us visit separately.  If you're interested in traveling to Town to meet up with us, we currently don't have set plans for Date1 or Date2.\"", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve been in the identical situation and I know exactly where you are coming from.  It got to the stage where coming home was more of a chore.  You travel hundreds upon hundreds, even thousands of miles yet they can\u2019t be bothered to travel the last few miles to see you.  I feel your pain and heartily endorse you setting firm rules.  Enjoy your vacation as much as you can.", "Every time I visited back to Dublin from Berlin, I would let family know I'd be at X location on Y date for Z hours. Did the same with most friends as well but at different times/locations.", "Military spouse(ret.) here.  NO NOT let people tell you how to spend your precious family leave.  I used to go home with my kids to visit for 2 weeks.  My parents would throw a big BBQ so I could see many of my family and friends in one place.  Other than that if they wanted to see me they had to come to me.  I was not going to chase all over the state.  Once I set that rule my vacation was much more enjoyable for me and my kiddos.  Stick to your guns and have fun!", "NTA. I grew up in a military family, and then married someone in the military. \n\nHere\u2019s what my mom would do (and I continued to do): Ask your parents (or in-laws, other kind relatives, friends, whoever) if you can host a bbq (or pizza party, potluck, whatever) at their home one afternoon. Spread the news amongst your family and friends that this is when they can see you.\n\nYou\u2019ll still get a few complaints from people who are too lazy to come to you or who legitimately can\u2019t make it work around their work schedule. You tell them, \u201cOh no! I\u2019m so sorry we won\u2019t be able to see each other this time. We\u2019ll see you next time we\u2019re home. Or you come see us!\u201d", "NTA - If you spend all your time driving around to see everyone, you will need a vacation after your \"vacation\" to recuperate.\n\nLet them come to you if they're able.  If not, they can see you next time you're back.", "NTA but I think it is a case by case on the family members. For example I am disabled and can\u2019t drive so I would need family to come to me or I couldn\u2019t see them. The same may be the case for elderly family members or those with young babies. So I think potentially NTA for family members too", "NTA.  This is a problem for everyone who travels \"home\" - family and friends sit on their arses and expect individual tailored visits.  It isn't possible, either physically or financially. I know people who've crossed the world to go \"home\" and not told their family and friends they're going to be in the old country.  Just visited old haunts and y'know, had a *holiday.*\n\nI have no idea why people expect returning travellers to do this.  Laziness?  Can't be bothered to make that small effort?  No clue.", "NTA NTA NTA!!! When me and my family visit our home country (we immigrated quite literally to the other side of the world) it grinds me the wrong way that our family expect us to travel everywhere to see them. nobody EVER comes to us. Its exhausting, tiring, and honestly a waste of time. We literally fly 24+ hours to get there. We are expecting to go to everyone. I fuckin hate it. Its your vacation. no hard feelings if they come, but they shouldn't be upset if you don't go to them. its just ridiculous in my opinion.", "The holiday will be ruined for all of you if you are stuck in a car travelling here there and everywhere. My brother and SIL booked an apartment when they travelled home and had one day for our side of the family and one for hers. We could all meet up and see them and nieces and nephews and have a great time snd it meant the rest of the time they could have an actual holiday. It worked and no one got stressed   Good luck and NTA", "NTA\n\nSometimes family sucks.\n\nI don\u2019t live in the same part of the country as my family. It\u2019s over 24 hours of driving away. \n\nThe last time I went back to visit on my own, my family had known for MONTHS when I was arriving and how long I was staying. My brother couldn\u2019t even be bothered to save one of his days off to see me. In fact, he took a day off work and took my niece and nephew out of town to do something with the other side of his family. \n\nThis was the common pattern. \n\nI use my time off. Pay to travel to see them. And no one will do anything with me. \n\nNo one has ever taken time off work to come see me. No one has ever paid to travel to me. They take plenty of time off to go on various trips, but I\u2019M the only one expected to use my time off to see family. \n\nSo. I don\u2019t bother anymore. While I would enjoy seeing them, it is a waste of my time because I go and then am stuck sitting at my parents house with nothing to do. If I\u2019m going to sit around and do nothing, I can do that at MY home or I can go somewhere new. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your family isn\u2019t valuing your time and effort.

We are going back home on vacation\n\nNTA - This is literally half my childhood.  We were posted from OK to FL to MT to MA to KS to NE and each summer would drive on the Interstates back to MO to visit family for two weeks.  We would try to squeeze in a trip to the zoo or an amusement park in that time.\n\nI had endless roadtrips with family and friends after HS and college too.  Finally, in middle-age, when driving on my own, I am able to visit all the little out of the way places that were passed by decades ago.\n\nYou have to set the line and call the shots and not be shoved out of your own vacations!!!\n\nNote: Years later, when my dad retired from the military and we settled in a city a day's drive away - how many of those in-laws made the effort to visit us?  ONE.", "NTA I was thinking the title was like taking leave. Vacations are for vacationing not for making others happy.", "This is a very old fashioned idea. I spent my entire childhood in the backseat of a Chevy being carted around with my two sisters every time we went to our home town. It was so f*cking annoying. My parents were aggravated and exhausted by the end of the vacation. \n\nBeing kind by giving plenty of notice and an open invite is enough. \n\nNTA", "NTA. We live on the other side of the country from most friends and family and that\u2019s our rule. We came 2800 miles to see people, y\u2019all can come a couple hours to us. No hard feelings if you can\u2019t/don\u2019t, but do NOT expect us to travel even more.", "NTA. Don't do it! My wife and I moved 2000 miles away from most of our families 20+ years ago, and so many of our vacations were spent going up to the state where they all lived and splitting out time between multiple houses, unpacking, repacking, driving, etc. (there were 4 different houses, with 3 sets of parents, and siblings all at least an hour and a half apart) We finally reached a point at which we were just \"look we're going to be HERE for x amount of time. Come and see us. Then we'll be HERE, and you can come and see us.\" We love going back to our home state and seeing people, but we want to enjoy our vacation. We rent places, centrally located to all of them, that have room for people to come and visit, even spend the night, but there has to be some compromise. We traveled a long way to be here, surely you can drive and hour and a half to this nice place we've arranged for so we don't have to uproot ourselves every other day.", "We are now retired military. I\u2019m not sure why people think we should have visited them when we were home. It always happened. We\u2019d travel home and they want us to travel to them. Even if it\u2019s 30 min away. I never had an answer for this. My goal was spend time with our parents/immediate families. Make that your priority no matter what.\n\nEdit: NTA!", "And we will usually have a friend/family members organize a get together to prevent us from a new thing daily. We will meet at this location, date, times, love to see everyone! Then it\u2019s on them.", "This.  A friend moved from the US to South Korea,  Whenever they are back in town, they of course have special plans with really good friends and fam.  And then they have one or two \"at Bar X on Y date\" nights so all the other people got a chance to say hi, without them running ragged all week.", "NTA former military wife here and I made the mistake of letting everyone know we were coming home once. I never made that mistake again. When we would visit I would quietly let those we were closest to know we were in town and that was it. If I had time I\u2019d reach out to others to meet up somewhere in town for like dinner or something but otherwise I didn\u2019t make coming home a big production. I\u2019m almost 15 years into living away from home and have stuck to that same strategy. it works beautifully. I also make it very clear that if we can come 1,000 miles to see everyone then anyone who wants to see us can come to us. I\u2019m happy to meet somewhere in my hometown, which happens to be a massive city in Florida, but I will not go out of my way to drive 2-4 hours to see someone and my husband and won\u2019t subject our kids to endless driving on their vacation. If we can make it work and feel like it then sure but that will be at our discretion when we\u2019re there I will not specifically schedule that kind of a drive in. My suggestion to you is grow a thick skin and get used to pissing some people off when you don\u2019t come to them. You have. You came however far you traveled to get home. You don\u2019t need to go a single mile further if you don\u2019t want to. My attitude is that anyone unwilling to drive a little or schedule the time to see us isn\u2019t worth more than the effort I\u2019ve already put in to get to where they are.", "I have military family. If they are remotely in our region one of us hosts a big family weekend so they can get the most bang for buck. The wedding is location specific but u agree, people can come to you (unless we\u2019re talking about blind meemaw in a wheelchair)", "NTA, at all", "For them to drive hours?  OPs family is already traveling from far away, the rest of them can drive the last few miles.", "Yup when I lived two hours away from my hometown whenever one of my two best friends who lived across the country came home to visit I\u2019d purposely schedule my time to go stay at my mom\u2019s a few days to see them. I made no demands on their time outside of say a dinner or something like that but I would tell them, \u201cI\u2019ll come these days and stay at my mom\u2019s while you\u2019re in town. I\u2019d love to plan something even if it\u2019s a lunch or dinner so I can see you.\u201d I know their families so I\u2019d often just join them in spending time with their family. Those 2 hours is the closest I\u2019ve lived to my hometown in 15 years. I currently live 1,100 miles away from home and prior to the last town I lived in i was 1,000 miles away from home so I totally understand the time constraints people have with coming home. Now that one of my best friends has moved back to my hometown she usually just comes and spends time with us at my mom\u2019s house when we visit and we try to schedule fun things to do together with our kids so it all works out well.", "NTA\n\n> the rest of our family and friends are asking us to drive 2-4 hours to come and visit them\n\nThis is a problem where people don\u2019t always realize that it\u2019s not one person asking you to drive 2-4 hours - it\u2019s a LOT.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a lot to put on someone who is already traveling to begin with.", "NTA.\nAs a person who has worked away from home for extended periods for many years, what I ended up doing was to organise a big bbq one day when I was back, all family welcome to come visit. \nThat way everyone gets caught up at once, there's no arguments about you being the reason they didnt catch up and you don't end up chasing family members to fit their schedules for your whole break and then go back to work more tired than before your break started.", "NTA!!!\n\nNavy family here. We\u2019ve spent most of my spouses career OCONUS.  My family is on the west coast and my parents have the room for us to stay with the kids having space for themselves.

I\u2019m not spending an extra $5k on tickets to share a room you can barely walk in.", "Stick to your guns.

You need to accept that these people who don't care enough to see you to make the drive really don't care that much.

When you have gotten home, you might want to communicate to these people who didn't show up that you now know how much to value them and wish them a good life.", "This happened in my family snd i never understood it either.

I live in another country B and every time I return to my original one  A it's the same to the point my parents come visit me in my new country B due to my needing a vacation after the vacation spent there  in A if I go visit. \n\nNTA\n\nOrganize a get together ( barbecue or something if you want) so they can all come and see you and the kids during your stay.
