Former military spouse here, and the best advice I got from other wives and husbands was that we made the majority of the effort. They can drive that 20 minute drive compared to your hours long/days long drive. It's the VERY least. We tried what you were going to do at first, but it was just too much.

Stick to your plan and make the most of it.", "NTA, it's absolutely unreasonable to have you drive hours to various locales.\n\nWhy can't everyone just meet up in one location? Restaurant or something?", "NTA. We are a military fam, too. Visiting family is not a vacation. And, this is very common. People have it in their mind that you are the ones who left, so it's on you to visit them. That isn't correct,but they think like that. \n\nWhat you said is correct. If they want to see your family, they can come. That is a healthy boundary. We all need to learn to set and maintain healthy boundaries with family. Watch youtubes to learn how. Make sure your husband does it with his family, too, and that you both are on the same page and have each other's backs when family starts pressuring you to do what's convenient for them. \n\nAs an experienced milso, I'm going to tell you that you should lower your expectations for the visit. Don't expect everyone to act as you would act if you were them. Be accepting of their own quirks and emotions or lack thereof. \n\nPart of your boundaries, especially with close family can be that you take turns Visiting each other or that you vacation together- at a vacation destination that you all fly to and meet up there, like a cruise. \n\nAnother great advice- Do not let them guilt you into doing what they want. Just say, \"I'm not comfortable with that.\"  Or \"That doesn't sound like an equitable compromise to me.\" \n\nIf you set your expectations too high, you will just be setting yourself up for disappointment. And, not everyone is as excited for new babies as you expect them to be, either. Keep your expectations in check. \n\nBe ready for them to do annoying things, like try to give your kids large gifts that won't fit in luggage, make thoughtless comments about the military or politics, and give you unsolicited advice. \n\nYou should already know this stuff, because this is a post made all the time on milso groups. \n\nBon voyage", "NTA we went through this early in our marriage.  A week isn't enough unless people will participate.  So we would do 1 d as y eith my family and 1 day with his, 1 day with my friends 1 day with his. If people can't come then it's their loss. Spend the rest of your time with each other", "NTA - It's your vacation and you shouldn't have to run yourself ragged running around trying to fit into everyone else's schedules, it is simply unreasonable. They have had plenty of notice, so if they want to see you and value your friendship they should be able to make the effort to come to you when you're nearby.", "NTA, it is unreasonable to expect you all to drive around to see family when you all are the ones visiting. They can make the drive to see yall, if they want to, if not, too bad", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, thank you and your husband for your service to our country as a military family. It's understandable that you want to spend some quality time with your family and reconnect with your spouse during your vacation. You are not in the wrong for setting boundaries and letting people know that you won't be able to visit everyone during your limited time off.  \nIt's important to remember that it's your vacation, and you have the right to spend it how you want. You've already made plans to visit some friends and family, and you've let everyone know your availability and location. **It's not your responsibility to cater to everyone's requests and drive long hours to visit them.**  \nFurthermore, it's unfair for people to expect you to do all the traveling and not make any effort to come to you. They should understand that you have limited time and resources, and they should be willing to meet you halfway.  \nIn conclusion, don't feel guilty for setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs during your vacation. Stick to your decision and enjoy the time with the people who make the effort to come to you.", "NTA-thank you both for your husband\u2019s service. \n\nYou probably could have handled it a little better, but you\u2019re well within your right to say no. I think I would have just responded to each invitation with, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but we just can\u2019t make the drive with everything else we have going on.\u201d I don\u2019t think you can really tell them they have to come to you because it starts to sound like a demand. Plus, each invite may not know about the others (unless is a group message), so they may not realize they are taking ALL your time. Their invites aren\u2019t unkind. They are offering to host your family, which probably involves great deal of preparation if done thoughtfully. People are generally very short-sighted.", "INFO: Are you staying with some family? If so, that might be the reason others aren't inviting themselves to come to a house where you're a a guest. \n\nWhy wouldn't you plan one \"event\" and just invite others to join?", "NTA I think you made the best choice considering the circumstances. I have a close family friend who lives away from us now and when her family comes back to town, they usually send out a message letting people know that they\u2019ll be at a particular bar or park or something for a set period of time and to please join them if you\u2019d like to catch up. That leaves it up to all of us to decide whether we care enough to go and see them and allows them to spend their visiting time wisely (ie not driving around).", "NTA. I was overseas for some time so coming home was a big thing. Of course, everyone wants you to come to them. The proble is, as you know, that results in no vacation, just driving everywhere.\n\nSecond time home, I went to specific family members homes and told the wider family I would be at those houses only. Most understood. Some came. A few did say \"come drive to us, we are only an hour away\" and were a bit sad to be turned down. They knew when where I would be though, so its a two way street\n\nThird visit home I told no one and just enjoyed myself. Gave a parents and siblings a surprise visit. Everyone got pissy when they later found out I was back, but downtime is important. they got over it. \n\nTotally NTA subby. Your vacation is yours, not to spend on visiting everyone, especially when most of them wont even make the effort to come to you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
