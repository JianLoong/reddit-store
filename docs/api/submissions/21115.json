I saw a lot of awful things, and a lot of shocking ones, but the worst call I ever saw was a mother who had accidentally rolled on top of her baby while sleeping and suffocated him. By the time she woke up and called us and we arrived, there were no signs of life. I will never forget the sound of that mothers screams as long as I live. Anyway, fast forward about six years and my husband and I just had our first baby, a little girl. My pregnancy had several complications, and things were very stressful. I started having nightmares that I rolled over on my own baby before she was even born, I used to wake up screaming and sobbing.\nMy SIL has always been a huge bed sharing advocate, always pushing the \u201cSafe Sleep 7\u201d. I\u2019ve never tried to discuss it with her because I know I won\u2019t change her mind, I\u2019ve watched others try. Anyway, during my third trimester she saw me online shopping for a bassinet and told me that it was a waste of money and would turn into an \u201cexpensive dirty clothes hamper\u201d. I kept the conversation light and just said, \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see.\u201d When baby girl was born, I sent a pic of her swaddled in her bassinet her first night home to my husbands family group chat and SIL responded, \u201cYeah, I remember swearing I wouldn\u2019t bed share lol. Just wait.\u201d \nWell, it\u2019s been 4 months and we\u2019ve still stuck with safe sleep. It hasn\u2019t been easy, as my daughter is a pretty rough sleeper. I mentioned to my MIL the other day how much I was looking forward to being able to start sleep training soon (before anyone loses their shit, relax, we will not be doing cry-it-out, there\u2019s other ways) so that way we can all get some more sleep. My SIL was in the other room but the door was open and she chimed in, \u201cIdk why you\u2019re fighting bed sharing so hard. Just stop torturing yourself by trying to avoid admitting you were wrong.\u201d\nIdk if it was the lack of sleep, the stress of my recent work project or the tone of her voice, but I kind of snapped. I turned around and said, \u201cYeah, well, seeing one dead baby from bed sharing was enough for me.\u201d\nShe got quiet, then freaked out, shouting that I was basically accusing her of endangering her children and started screaming that she\u2019d been bedsharing with all three of them and they were perfectly fine. My husband is backing me 110% but his family told me bringing up a dead baby was a low blow. Maybe it WAS a little bit harsh, but I can\u2019t even begin to explain how that one call kinda messed me up.

It sounds like SHE is the one who can\u2019t admit she was wrong. You tried to avoid the topic with her and she\u2019s the one who kept pushing the issue. There was no low blow about it, she pushed it and you were honest with her. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. There are few things worse than a parent who believes their way is the only correct way and that everyone else is doing it wrong. I'm glad you put her in her place, although I'm sorry you had to relive that trauma just to get her to shut up.", "NTA.  I think you're probably having a bit of PTSD from seeing that dead baby so maybe it came out a little bit harsh, so that's probably hard to regulate, but I think she kept pressing you and it was fine to just be honest.\n\nI'm sorry you experienced the trauma of that poor woman and the child she lost, I can't imagine something worse.  I'm so sorry.", "NTA. You have a valid perspective based on personal observation. She pushed and pushed and pushed, you responded.", "Absolutely NTA. She kept sharing repeatedly and aggressively sharing unsolicited opinions about YOUR parenting choices. She wasn\u2019t talking about her own. She was telling you what you should do. And arguing with you about it. You honestly answered her question about how she didn\u2019t know why you were fighting it so hard. Welp. Now she knows. This is classic FAFO. \n\nAlso you are doing a great job, mama. Good luck with sleep training. We did it too moms on call style and we stuck with it and we\u2019re so happy in the end. You\u2019re gonna be fine.", "NTA. She needed to drop the issue. It\u2019s a parent\u2019s choice if they want to co sleep and any possible risks that come with it. You also have trauma around the subject, and I don\u2019t see how using it to explain why you are choosing to not do something is a low blow to your SIL.", "NTA and you don\u2019t have to explain or defend your position to your overbearing SIL.", "NTA...\n\nAT\nALL", "Nta She needs to mind her own business.  Nobody likes the parenting police.", "Totally NTA. Been working crime scene investigations for almost 15 years. Also worked as a death investigator for the area medical examiner.  Will never ever co sleep for the exact same reason, but with years of first hand stories to back it up.", "No need to apologise for your trauma. She was the one baiting you over and over with her unrequested opinions. Classic case of farq around and find out. NTA", "NTA. We cosleep but we don\u2019t take it lightly and didn\u2019t start until our baby was 6 months old. It took us a very long time to even be comfortable with it, knowing that it\u2019s an incredibly risky sleeping situation. \n\nFor you having to have gone through that call as an EMT would be life changing. I can totally understand the trauma around seeing that happen, and I assume your SIL knows about it too. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if she is going to make different choices for her family but she needs to respect that you might make different choices, and not belittle them. I know lots of people who do ABCs and a few who bedshare. Bedsharing is statistically considered an unsafe/riskier option and IDGAF about the safe sleep 7; there\u2019s no way that\u2019s always going to be enough. \n\nIf she is going to make a risky choice then fine, but don\u2019t push it on to others and then get pissy when someone refuses to validate your lifestyle by mimicking it. \n\nP.S. I do like HeySleepyBaby on ig for gentle sleep practices if you are exploring different methods. Sending you guys all the Sleepy dust!!! Congrats on your new baby. And take care of yourself especially if you have any PPA. It\u2019s a hard time period.", "NTA", "Your SIL sounds like an sanctimonious AH. NTA. She kept pushing her views on your parenting.", "NTA from a parent who lost a child from someone rolling over on him", "Look, bringing up one instance of a parent suffocating their child (usually this involves some kind of drug or alcohol) to justify your actions was absolutely a low blow. \n\nEven in your post, you call the bassinet \u201csafe sleep\u201d when there\u2019s multiple methods of \u201csafe\u201d sleep. I say that because SIDS happens in cribs all the time too.  Bedsharing is biologically normal especially when breastfeeding. \n\nBUT\u2026.she does need to mind her own business. For many many parents, bedsharing is what gets everyone sleep. For some parents, bedsharing causes major anxiety which leads to even worse sleep. \n\nA great in between is a sidecar crib to keep baby on their own surface but close to you to touch and let baby sleep better. Either way, it\u2019s completely your choice. \n\nThe better response would be that you appreciate her input but bedsharing doesn\u2019t work for your family and you prefer to try something else. If she keeps bringing it up, tell her you don\u2019t care for her input and to move on. \n\nAs a side note, self soothing and sleep is developmental. Just like you can\u2019t force a baby to walk early, you can\u2019t force a baby to sleep long stretches. \n\nOverall, super soft YTA for the dead baby thing but N T A for doing what works for your family. \n\nBoth methods are safe.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She said she never shamed SIL or tried to talk her out of it, but SIL had some weird point to prove and couldn\u2019t drop it, basically criticizing OPs parenting methods (which seem to be doing great). Anyone would snap at the constant nagging, and OP clearly has gone through some trauma.
