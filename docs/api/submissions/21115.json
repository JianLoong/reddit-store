It took us a very long time to even be comfortable with it, knowing that it\u2019s an incredibly risky sleeping situation. \n\nFor you having to have gone through that call as an EMT would be life changing. I can totally understand the trauma around seeing that happen, and I assume your SIL knows about it too. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if she is going to make different choices for her family but she needs to respect that you might make different choices, and not belittle them. I know lots of people who do ABCs and a few who bedshare. Bedsharing is statistically considered an unsafe/riskier option and IDGAF about the safe sleep 7; there\u2019s no way that\u2019s always going to be enough. \n\nIf she is going to make a risky choice then fine, but don\u2019t push it on to others and then get pissy when someone refuses to validate your lifestyle by mimicking it. \n\nP.S. I do like HeySleepyBaby on ig for gentle sleep practices if you are exploring different methods. Sending you guys all the Sleepy dust!!! Congrats on your new baby. And take care of yourself especially if you have any PPA. It\u2019s a hard time period.", "NTA", "Your SIL sounds like an sanctimonious AH. NTA. She kept pushing her views on your parenting.", "NTA from a parent who lost a child from someone rolling over on him", "Look, bringing up one instance of a parent suffocating their child (usually this involves some kind of drug or alcohol) to justify your actions was absolutely a low blow. \n\nEven in your post, you call the bassinet \u201csafe sleep\u201d when there\u2019s multiple methods of \u201csafe\u201d sleep. I say that because SIDS happens in cribs all the time too.  Bedsharing is biologically normal especially when breastfeeding. \n\nBUT\u2026.she does need to mind her own business. For many many parents, bedsharing is what gets everyone sleep. For some parents, bedsharing causes major anxiety which leads to even worse sleep. \n\nA great in between is a sidecar crib to keep baby on their own surface but close to you to touch and let baby sleep better. Either way, it\u2019s completely your choice. \n\nThe better response would be that you appreciate her input but bedsharing doesn\u2019t work for your family and you prefer to try something else. If she keeps bringing it up, tell her you don\u2019t care for her input and to move on. \n\nAs a side note, self soothing and sleep is developmental. Just like you can\u2019t force a baby to walk early, you can\u2019t force a baby to sleep long stretches. \n\nOverall, super soft YTA for the dead baby thing but N T A for doing what works for your family. \n\nBoth methods are safe.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Anyone would snap at the constant nagging, and OP clearly has gone through some trauma. Clearly the dead baby comment wasn\u2019t even directed at SIL because her kids are fine, it was just a general concern that op has of what can happen. If SIL took it personally that\u2019s on her.", "NTA. Every training on SIDS/ SUIDS mentions an unsafe sleep environment as a contributing factor in most cases. If she wants to make a big deal about not admitting you're wrong, I don't think it's out of line to point out that what she's advocating for is, in fact, dangerous.", "NTA:\nFirst off, your SIL is projecting and acting out of a place of embarrassment. Even if you take all the medical/legitimate evidence against co-sleeping out of this equation, she had a huge foot in her mouth moment because all along you\u2019ve had aincredibly legitimate reason to not co-sleep based on your own experience. She backed herself into a corner and her self-preservation mode took over in the form of lashing out. \n\nSecond, I think without realizing it, when people feel strongly, particularly about things like parenting, nutrition, health, etc., they can become very pushy for whatever cause their advocating for and not respectful of others choices. This sounds exactly what is going on with your SIL.  Part of being a mature adult is \u201creading the room\u201d and recognizing when others aren\u2019t open to whatever they\u2019re advocating for. Your SIL has had several chances to \u201cread the room\u201d and just like you\u2019ve been respectful and aware that you\u2019re not going to change her mind about co-sleeping, she\u2019s not going to change your mind either. \n\nThird, you in no way insinuated that she was endangering her kids. Don\u2019t be gaslit into being the bad person here. The reality is she took a risk with co-sleeping and you personally saw that risk firsthand. It doesn\u2019t sound like you made it personal like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to endanger my baby like you did.\u201d You were simply stating reality: that co-sleeping can have life-ending consequences.

All I could think was \"wow I'm glad I woke up cause I feel like I could have really hurt her if I rolled over\".", "NTA. She's insecure and knows deep down babies die from bed sharing. She wants you to be like her so she doesn't have to feel guilty about it. \n\nI never bed shared with my babies. Sure it's hard. But too many babies die like that and survivors bias doesn't fix that. Bed sharing being popular around the world doesn't make it safe. \n\n\nHowever...this is not just about bed sharing as it is about letting people parent the way they want to parent. I have had bed sharing friends and they can do what they want, it's not my business. She was wrong to push this on you. It's not her child or her business. She needs to get over herself and leave you alone.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have ever had to deal with the badgering about your safe, reasonable and very common parenting decision.  She should have gotten back into her lane about 5 months ago.  \n\nI think you have shown remarkable restraint in not telling her off much sooner. \n\nI am terribly sorry you have to live with the memory of that heartbreaking and traumatic callout and I hope you will consider talking to someone about it now that having your own baby has made it so immediate for you again.  \n\nI hope your wonderlump takes well to the sleep training.", "Definitely NTA. Bed sharing is dangerous, which you well know. It seems to,me that it\u2019s also very impractical. Soon, you will be able to move your little one out of the bassinet into a crib in their own room. Kids thrive on routine. If they have their own crib in their own room, they can have a reasonable bedtime. If their bedtime is say 8 pm or even earlier, they\u2019ll get enough sleep even if they wake up early. The rest of the evening is time for you to do chores or just relax for a few. Then you can go to your own bed and sleep without worrying about rolling over on your child or making noise and waking them up. That\u2019s more restful for you. If you bed share, does that mean the child can\u2019t go to sleep until you\u2019re there? If so, then either your evening is cut short or the child goes to bed late and may not get as much sleep.", "NTA and I absolutely did bedshare - I just don't pretend there are no risks.

Okay, cool. Still safe. Then he decided he wouldn\u2019t sleep on his back. At all. Rock him to sleep, sing a million songs, watch a season of a show on mute, it\u2019s 4am?

For what it\u2019s worth, I did try to make sure the positions were as safe as I could; boppy pillow tucked around us both so neither of us would move/roll while wedged into the couch at an angle, or leaving his arms out of the swaddle so they\u2019d act as anchors while he laid on that boppy. \n\nWell little mister is nearly 4 now, still as crazy a sleeper as ever, and still sleeps on that same boppy pillow he\u2019s had from birth. \n\nYour SIL ought to know better as a parent than to push her situation onto others, I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t appreciate it either.
