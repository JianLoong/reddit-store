It took us a very long time to even be comfortable with it, knowing that it\u2019s an incredibly risky sleeping situation. \n\nFor you having to have gone through that call as an EMT would be life changing. I can totally understand the trauma around seeing that happen, and I assume your SIL knows about it too. \n\nIt\u2019s fine if she is going to make different choices for her family but she needs to respect that you might make different choices, and not belittle them. I know lots of people who do ABCs and a few who bedshare. Bedsharing is statistically considered an unsafe/riskier option and IDGAF about the safe sleep 7; there\u2019s no way that\u2019s always going to be enough. \n\nIf she is going to make a risky choice then fine, but don\u2019t push it on to others and then get pissy when someone refuses to validate your lifestyle by mimicking it. \n\nP.S. I do like HeySleepyBaby on ig for gentle sleep practices if you are exploring different methods. Sending you guys all the Sleepy dust!!! Congrats on your new baby.

I say that because SIDS happens in cribs all the time too.  Bedsharing is biologically normal especially when breastfeeding. \n\nBUT\u2026.she does need to mind her own business. For many many parents, bedsharing is what gets everyone sleep. For some parents, bedsharing causes major anxiety which leads to even worse sleep. \n\nA great in between is a sidecar crib to keep baby on their own surface but close to you to touch and let baby sleep better. Either way, it\u2019s completely your choice. \n\nThe better response would be that you appreciate her input but bedsharing doesn\u2019t work for your family and you prefer to try something else. If she keeps bringing it up, tell her you don\u2019t care for her input and to move on. \n\nAs a side note, self soothing and sleep is developmental. Just like you can\u2019t force a baby to walk early, you can\u2019t force a baby to sleep long stretches. \n\nOverall, super soft YTA for the dead baby thing but N T A for doing what works for your family. \n\nBoth methods are safe.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If SIL took it personally that\u2019s on her.", "NTA. Every training on SIDS/ SUIDS mentions an unsafe sleep environment as a contributing factor in most cases. If she wants to make a big deal about not admitting you're wrong, I don't think it's out of line to point out that what she's advocating for is, in fact, dangerous.", "NTA:\nFirst off, your SIL is projecting and acting out of a place of embarrassment. Even if you take all the medical/legitimate evidence against co-sleeping out of this equation, she had a huge foot in her mouth moment because all along you\u2019ve had aincredibly legitimate reason to not co-sleep based on your own experience. She backed herself into a corner and her self-preservation mode took over in the form of lashing out. \n\nSecond, I think without realizing it, when people feel strongly, particularly about things like parenting, nutrition, health, etc., they can become very pushy for whatever cause their advocating for and not respectful of others choices. This sounds exactly what is going on with your SIL.  Part of being a mature adult is \u201creading the room\u201d and recognizing when others aren\u2019t open to whatever they\u2019re advocating for. Your SIL has had several chances to \u201cread the room\u201d and just like you\u2019ve been respectful and aware that you\u2019re not going to change her mind about co-sleeping, she\u2019s not going to change your mind either. \n\nThird, you in no way insinuated that she was endangering her kids. Don\u2019t be gaslit into being the bad person here. The reality is she took a risk with co-sleeping and you personally saw that risk firsthand. It doesn\u2019t sound like you made it personal like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to endanger my baby like you did.\u201d You were simply stating reality: that co-sleeping can have life-ending consequences.

Bed sharing being popular around the world doesn't make it safe. \n\n\nHowever...this is not just about bed sharing as it is about letting people parent the way they want to parent.

Bed sharing is dangerous, which you well know. It seems to,me that it\u2019s also very impractical. Soon, you will be able to move your little one out of the bassinet into a crib in their own room. Kids thrive on routine. If they have their own crib in their own room, they can have a reasonable bedtime. If their bedtime is say 8 pm or even earlier, they\u2019ll get enough sleep even if they wake up early. The rest of the evening is time for you to do chores or just relax for a few. Then you can go to your own bed and sleep without worrying about rolling over on your child or making noise and waking them up. That\u2019s more restful for you.

Or get up every 20 minutes for another night. It would be incredibly unsafe as I will fall asleep holding him, I\u2019m certain. So I put him on the bed next to me. Did I sleep? Hell no. But I rested. My eyes were shut and my body was resting. Every time I\u2019ve ended up bed sharing (the few nights it\u2019s been a necessity) has been the same. I honestly don\u2019t understand how a mother can roll onto her baby and suffocate it. Every time I\u2019ve \u201cwoken\u201d up in exactly the same position. I haven\u2019t moved a muscle. Down to my little finger being pointing in the same direction. If he breathes loudly or sighs I\u2019m instantly awake. It\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t like bed sharing, for me I just don\u2019t get any \u201creal\u201d sleep.\n\nEveryone is different. Every baby is different. If I could feel rested enough when bed sharing I would honestly switch to it so quickly. My baby is a bad sleeper. An average night is 7 wake ups. He\u2019s 6 months. 7 is a massive improvement on where he was.\n\nBasically, don\u2019t judge others. And don\u2019t think your better because you don\u2019t bedshare (yet). You\u2019re incredibly lucky to have not hit the levels of exhaustion that make it necessary.\n\nAlso, what are the sleep training methods that aren\u2019t basically cry it out? I\u2019ve been desperately trying to find ones that aren\u2019t \u201ccry it out whilst sitting next to baby\u201d or \u201ccry it out but with a timer\u201d?! Please, honestly, if you know of something that will help me, please let me know. If I leave him to cry whilst sitting next to him, or picking him up when he cries, or giving it a timer etc etc he gets himself so upset (whilst I\u2019m holding him and comforting him and trying to calm him down!!) that he makes himself throw up.
