She fucked around and she found out. Comparing you by potential salary is ridiculous and childish. You removed yourself from the situation and then she followed you to instigate it further. You're NTA for reminding her that she didn't like being treated like shit and is now making someone else feel like shit. Bullied or not. She's the asshole.", "NTA. She is no better than those girls. Truth hurts. Yes, dead animals in the mailbox is horrible. So is bullying your stepdaughter for years just to make yourself feel better.", "NTA. She is a bully. You were just pointing it out. The truth hurts. The fact that she didn\u2019t stuff dead animals into your belongings doesn\u2019t make her less of a bully. Her bullying is psychological than physical. About time she got called out.", "NTA. Sounds like you're giving her a dose of the truth. If she doesn't like being called a bully, she shouldn't be a bully.", "NTA.  She is abusive and a bully.  I would go out to breakfast with just your dad and explain to him how his wife treats you and makes you feel.  Tell him these are the reasons why you will no longer be visiting. \n\nUltimately he is the biggest ahole because his job is to protect and stand up for you as his child, yet he is continually allowing his wife to abuse you and has no spine to stick up for you.", "NTA\n\nShe's a grown ass adult. If she's using you as some kind of punching bag, she shouldn't be surprised when you decide you're tired of her shit.", "NTA. Stepmother shouldn't dish it out if she can't take it.", "NTA. Sounds like she wasn\u2019t bullied but maybe retaliated against.", "NTA\n\nShe is being a bully. I\u2019m assuming by your wording that she had been in your life for at least some time while you were a minor. That makes this exponentially inappropriate of her\u2014 on top of treating any person like that.", "NTA. \n\nWhere is your dad in all of this? Has he tried to stop her horrible behavior?", "NTA. Good luck in graduate school, your future sounds bright and promising and I'm happy for you!!", "Maybe laying it out so starkly will make her look at her behavior.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nGood luck with your studies. Work hard and get away as soon as you can. I presume your father accepts this behavior towards you so screw all of them.\n\nStart referring to your father's wife as the step-bully from now on.", "Certainly sounds like you two have some issues to work out.\n\nIt also sounds like you cannot wait to pounce on her, this doesn\u2019t sound one sided. Example from your post - your family is fawning over the cousin, but you singled out stepmom. Everyone was failing to acknowledge you, yet you single her out. Why is that? Then she comes upstairs, and according to you just randomly picks a fight about how you treat dad.  No precursor, no reason, just out of the blue. Cmon, tell the story straight, that makes zero sense at all!\n\nDon\u2019t know what creates all this on her end (It isn\u2019t narcissism, by the way, that would be putting you down to put **herself** on a pedestal, and that\u2019s not what you describe at all) or yours, but the friction is sad to read about and I do hope you two bury it and find a better way forward.\n\nESH, it really feels like you both need to take a deep breath and reset.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They get abused for bread crumbs. The only way to get a lot of money as a nurse is to do travel during pandemic. And you need at least a year of floor experience before you can travel (2 normally, but things are a little crazy right now). If things fizzle out by the time she's eligible to travel, she won't be getting filthy rich. And who knows if she's even interested in the nomadic lifestyle.
