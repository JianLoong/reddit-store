The truth hurts. The fact that she didn\u2019t stuff dead animals into your belongings doesn\u2019t make her less of a bully. Her bullying is psychological than physical.

I would go out to breakfast with just your dad and explain to him how his wife treats you and makes you feel.  Tell him these are the reasons why you will no longer be visiting. \n\nUltimately he is the biggest ahole because his job is to protect and stand up for you as his child, yet he is continually allowing his wife to abuse you and has no spine to stick up for you.", "NTA\n\nShe's a grown ass adult.

Sounds like she wasn\u2019t bullied but maybe retaliated against.", "NTA\n\nShe is being a bully.

Then she comes upstairs, and according to you just randomly picks a fight about how you treat dad.  No precursor, no reason, just out of the blue. Cmon, tell the story straight, that makes zero sense at all!\n\nDon\u2019t know what creates all this on her end (It isn\u2019t narcissism, by the way, that would be putting you down to put **herself** on a pedestal, and that\u2019s not what you describe at all) or yours, but the friction is sad to read about and I do hope you two bury it and find a better way forward.\n\nESH, it really feels like you both need to take a deep breath and reset.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They get abused for bread crumbs. The only way to get a lot of money as a nurse is to do travel during pandemic.

If things fizzle out by the time she's eligible to travel, she won't be getting filthy rich. And who knows if she's even interested in the nomadic lifestyle.

I'd ask if she maybe did something to deserve the ridicule and torture from the girls. The way she acts now could be how she was then. Gaslighting and narcissistic. Reminds me of the high school reunion episode of 30 Rock. Liz thought she was bullied and in fact she was the bully the whole time. She traumatized her classmates. But you had to defend yourself.

It's a recognized pattern refered to as the \"cycle of abuse.\" While typically this refers to domestic or parental abuse incentivizing reciprocal behaviour that out lasts the relationship, lasting aggression issues, or the normalization of abuse as a method of relationship management, this can also describe former victims of bullying who go on to take out their issues on unaffiliated parties.\n\nYour step-mom treats you like shit, mocks your interests, and then starts a random fight with you even though you've done fucking nothing to justify her actions.
