I (19F) recently started dating Bryce (21M). The other night, we went to hang out with a bunch of his friends and a few of mine at someone's apartment. Everyone was a bit tipsy but I didn't drink because I was driving us home. We were playing stupid party games like charades and truth or dare, and it was Bryce's turn to ask me a question. I said Truth, and he asked me what my body count was. I don't really think it's a huge deal, so I answered honestly (mid single digits). He made a face and said \"eesh, slut alert!\" There was a huge chorus of laughter as he reenacted a sex act, pretending to be me. I was honestly so angry and embarrassed and didn't know what to do. A part of me was considering just getting up and leaving but I completely saw red and fired back.\n\nI asked Bryce what his body count was in retaliation and he answered with a number significantly HIGHER THAN MINE. And as he said it, he made this stupid smug little face as if he was daring me to say something. I then made a face of my own and said \"yikes, all that practice definitely hasn't helped. 30 seconds if we're being generous?\" He got really quiet and no one said anything except for my best friend, who cracked up. I just got up and grabbed my stuff to go and he followed saying nothing. It was truly painfully awkward leaving and no one said a word, but I honestly didn't care because it felt like he brought it upon himself. He stayed silent for the first few minutes of the drive home but blew up at me eventually. I called him a hypocrite because he had said done essentially the same thing to me moments before, but he said it was different because he was drunk and was \"only kidding\". I said \"well I was kidding too. So that makes it okay, right?\" He wouldn't stop screaming about how he was drunk and it was a joke and woke bitches like me need to learn how to take a fucking joke. I just silently pulled up to his building and eventually he left the car in a fury.\n\nMy best friend, bless her heart, says that what I did was awesome and I should dump him immediately. But when I told my other friends, they said that I went way too far and that it was different because it was mostly his friends there and he wasn't in a right state of mind to even know what he was saying. He honestly wasn't even that drunk, but I do feel bad for embarrassing him in front of everyone. He's been texting me non-stop with screenshots of his friends relentlessly calling him bad in bed and that he has a micropenis. I still think he's an asshole for embarassing ME in front of everyone, but I do think it's different because it wasn't my friends. I haven't answered any of his texts or calls, but it's getting to the point where I probably should. I want to reconcile because I do feel guilty, but I don't know if he even thinks he did anything wrong.

I (19F) recently started dating Bryce (21M). The other night, we went to hang out with a bunch of his friends and a few of mine at someone's apartment. Everyone was a bit tipsy but I didn't drink because I was driving us home. We were playing stupid party games like charades and truth or dare, and it was Bryce's turn to ask me a question. I said Truth, and he asked me what my body count was. I don't really think it's a huge deal, so I answered honestly (mid single digits). He made a face and said \"eesh, slut alert!\" There was a huge chorus of laughter as he reenacted a sex act, pretending to be me. I was honestly so angry and embarrassed and didn't know what to do. A part of me was considering just getting up and leaving but I completely saw red and fired back.\n\nI asked Bryce what his body count was in retaliation and he answered with a number significantly HIGHER THAN MINE. And as he said it, he made this stupid smug little face as if he was daring me to say something. I then made a face of my own and said \"yikes, all that practice definitely hasn't helped. 30 seconds if we're being generous?\" He got really quiet and no one said anything except for my best friend, who cracked up. I just got up and grabbed my stuff to go and he followed saying nothing. It was truly painfully awkward leaving and no one said a word, but I honestly didn't care because it felt like he brought it upon himself. He stayed silent for the first few minutes of the drive home but blew up at me eventually. I called him a hypocrite because he had said done essentially the same thing to me moments before, but he said it was different because he was drunk and was \"only kidding\". I said \"well I was kidding too. So that makes it okay, right?\" He wouldn't stop screaming about how he was drunk and it was a joke and woke bitches like me need to learn how to take a fucking joke. I just silently pulled up to his building and eventually he left the car in a fury.\n\nMy best friend, bless her heart, says that what I did was awesome and I should dump him immediately. But when I told my other friends, they said that I went way too far and that it was different because it was mostly his friends there and he wasn't in a right state of mind to even know what he was saying. He honestly wasn't even that drunk, but I do feel bad for embarrassing him in front of everyone. He's been texting me non-stop with screenshots of his friends relentlessly calling him bad in bed and that he has a micropenis. I still think he's an asshole for embarassing ME in front of everyone, but I do think it's different because it wasn't my friends. I haven't answered any of his texts or calls, but it's getting to the point where I probably should.

You sound very mature and thoughtful, just in general but especially for your age. Notice though, that while you are tempted to apologize because you feel guilty and don't want to be in a fight with him, he still will not apologize. When you told him why you were upset, he attacked your character rather than your logic/argument. He refused to recognize your hurt and invalidated your feelings with insults, again, just attacking your character.

And my biggest pitfall was \"well I know them well, and they can't be manipulative/abusive because I don't think they're really masterminding a big abusive scheme, they're just saying what they think\". So in case you're like me at all, it does NOT matter if they intend to or even know they are being manipulative. Id even say most manipulative people don't know thats what theyre doing. A large part of their toxicity comes from refusing to hold themselves accountable or self reflect.\n\nSo, considering this, do you want to be with someone who does not apologize or respect your feelings/opinions? Someone who will tear you down and insult you when you get into disagreements and blame your upset on you \"being too woke\" or just too flawed as a person?\n\nEveryone has the capability to change, and relationships can go through strife, this is true.

It probably would\u2019ve been more classy to not respond like that but he did need to be put in his place.", "Explain please", "absolutely not, he slutshamed her in public and she stood up for herself", "also, fuck everyone in both of the friend groups except for your best friend, cause why tf would they laugh at your expense, and switch up when you react?? i'm sorry for being rude about ur friends, but baby you deserve better", "Him being mean to you in front of HIS friends is a tactic. Yes. He expected you to just sit there and take it because if you did, it would show all his friends he was in the power position. The fact that you retaliated and now his friends are making fun of him instead blew his plan out of the water. This will not change. Ask me how I know. Dump him now and give your BFF hug because she's got you. Not so much for your other friends. Oh. And him being drunk is not an excuse. That's who he really is.", "Ngl he\u2019s probably used to dating insecure women who would take it laying down. Honestly get a better man he showed his true colors. Let me ask you this. If you had a daughter would you want her to go through this? So why should you?", "He THOUGHT he was going to show everyone that you would eat his shit with a smile.  Good for you showing him that is toxic. \n\nFind a man not an insecure rat.", "NTA.  He called you a slut and a bitch, and you want to stay with him?  He brought this on himself.", "He slut shamed you and called you woke. He is a misogynist with the usual double standards and doesn't respect you. He was drunk, but he said what he meant.", "You were not toxic - you responded to his bullshit perfectly. You were not being juvenile either - he tried to shame you and you, quite rightly, called him out on his misogynistic double standards. You should not have to sit there and take that sort of attitude. And don\u2019t even get me started on his appalling behaviour in the car - although I will say that him blaming it on the booze is unacceptable: if you need to excuse or try to justify your behaviour on outside influences, you know you shouldn\u2019t have done what you did. He will probably behave similarly the next time he\u2019s drunk and the next etc. Please don\u2019t continue a relationship with him - a good man who truly respects you won\u2019t try to make you feel ashamed of your past.", "1. Leave him. He's a bully and sexist as all get-out and you don't need that in your life.\n2. Don't play stupid \"truth or dare\" games, especially when anyone in the group has been drinking. They rarely end well because invariably (well, almost invariably) someone will push it toward private information, and then people get embarrassed (not in a fun way), feelings are hurt, relationships can be damaged, and it all goes to hell. Don't do it.\n3. Finally, NTA.", "It was basically a form of negging, really obnoxiously. It was to pander to his friends and make him look good, and bring your self esteem down. And if he makes you feel bad about your \u201ccount\u201d you\u2019ll be anxious to leave him and \u201cincrease\u201d it\n\nEdit: dump him. He\u2019s immature and cruel", "Well if you stay with him, you are taking it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He called you a woke bitch. You need to actually wake up to what kind of a person he is. Drunk people and kids always tell the truth.", "Nta \n\n\nIn all those texts and calls, has he apologized even once? Or is he just trying to make you feel guilty for embarrassing him? \n\n\nConsider why it\u2019s better for you to be embarrassed in front of his friends than him? Why is it okay for only you to be the butt of the joke? And sorry bout it, but the reason his friends are still teasing him is bc he confirmed your accusation by getting emotional instead of just laughing and brushing it off.", "NTA Please Please don't reconcile if you do it sends the message you okay with his behaviour and he WILL up the anty for next time because he isn't forgetting this.", "I disagree that you were being toxic at all. Your point was to educate him on how it feels to be judged by someone who is supposed to care for you. If nobody stands up to bullies, they become empowered and become even worse bullies. Maybe next time, he\u2019ll think twice. Thank you for standing up to him. Any friends that tell you otherwise are not friends.", "Oh honey, take it from an old lady who was raised by a pack of wild drag queens in my youth. You were anything but toxic or even juvenile. You just had a much better comeback, and he got exactly what he deserved, NTA.", "Yea it might\u2019ve been a little toxic for sure but honestly it was super justified and you absolutely ended it. \n\nWhat he said was so much more toxic and he was the one who started it. What he said was so horrible and unnecessary and the fact he did it in public was so much worse. The fact that he\u2019s a hypocrite besides just puts the final nail in the coffin tbh.", "Your friends that say you were ta have internalized misogyny and need to evolve past that. NTA", "Standing up for yourself, especially in a single moment, isn't toxic babe. What's toxic is him starting this shit show in the first place, in public or not. If this is how he acts now, infront of people, imagine how much worse it'll be in the future behind closed doors.\n\nI look forward to you informing us you dumped him.", "Thanks!", ">Because usually i am NOT that quick\n\nYour bf rubbed off on you.", "Don't you dare apologize to him and reconcile. I promise if you do, in 10 years, you'll look back and kick yourself for letting this shit slide. The only good friend you got is the one that backed you up. Keep her for life. He wanted to knock you down in front of his friends. He deserves every bit of the bullshit they're giving him.", "I especially liked how her friends told her that he didn't know what he was saying because he was drunk, but he somehow magically understood what *she* was saying. Definitely on board with the 'dump him' crowd.", "What a shock that the AH has AH friends. I\u2019m impressed by OP.", "This tactic is abuse. I have a close friend going through a divorce and this was one of the tactics he used (there are many more coming). He also gaslit you saying it was just a joke but was clearly to entertain his friends and earn kudos with them. The he called you woke, which is effing beyond. \n\nYou need to leave him and block him. And warn others that he is an emotionally abusive ahole. I'd ghost him. Or shame him for the abuse. Eff that guy.", "And he has a double standard. Your sexual past makes you a sl*t but he throws his higher \"count\" in your face as if it's ok for men but not for women. His use of \"woke\" to describe a woman who isn't subservient, is quite telling. Run and don't look back.", "She hit him with an epic UNO reverse card. He'll be in the burn unit for weeks because of her lol.", "Wish I could upvote you numerous times.", "I'm so impressed too. I would have NEVER come up with a response so good so quickly.  I definitely think of them way after the fact. But I'm not shocked that AH had friends. AHs like to hang with other AHs. Luckily OP has her BFF. She's a keeper. \n\nEdit. You said what a shocker AH has AH friends. Haha yeah misread that. Not a shocker at all that his friends are also AHs.", "Thankyou!!!!!"]}
