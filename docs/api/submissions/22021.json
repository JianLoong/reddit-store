I love her dearly.\n\nHer mother (my mil) passed away in January. They were close and it's been hard for her, especially as her dad passed away a long time ago when she was little and she doesn't have any siblings. She feels like she needs to keep her \"family history\" alive which has led into a hoarding situation. Basically, when her mother passed, my wife had a hard time letting go. We emptied the mil's house and managed to sell it, but my wife insisted on keeping several boxes of \"family heirlooms\" (dish wear, lamps, books etc. mostly useless things but important to her) and ordinary things that belonged to her mother (dresses, shoes, pillows, albums etc).\n\nFor months, these boxes filled our storage room, an entire wall of our living room, one corner of my office, two kitchen cabinets and our shed. I get that she's sad, but I've repeatedly asked her to sort through these boxes because we can't keep on living like this. She said she wasn't ready to throw/give away things that had been dear to her mother and asked me to give her more time. Mind you, her mother died in January so it's been months already.\n\nYesterday when she was at work, I finally had enough. I went through the boxes myself. I threw away everything that was useless and burnt everything (but photos) that was made out of paper or similar material. I managed to empty out the shed and clear my office of her things.\n\nI did expect her to be a bit upset, but she went livid when she got home. She kept crying for hours and wouldn't speak to me. Now she's saying she wants me to go to my parents' because she \"can't stand to look at me\". I pointed out we own this house together and that she can't just kick me out. I understand she needs time, but I need my living space. And ultimately I was just trying to help her to move on.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nedit: Okay so I want to clear up some things: I didn't throw away *everything*. I only cleared up the shed and my office, the two places I use the most. She still has plenty of boxes elsewhere in the house. And I didn't *burn* everything either.

You didn't help her to move on, you took away her way to have a satisfying conclusion of her grief when she goes over those boxes and memories and decides what to keep and what not. You are an incredibly selfish person and I can't believe you don't realize it. It's been half a year only since her ONLY PARENT THAT SHE GREW UP WITH AND ONLY IMMEDIATE LIVING FAMILY passed away. People get hit by the parents passing away and sometimes it can take years to go over it (and not completely). \n\nYou threw it and BURNED IT AWAY? Are you for real?

YTA", "YTA. \n\nI would try to breakdown all the reasons why this was a horrible, cruel thing for you to do, but I think you might actually be too smooth-brained for any of it to sink in, so I won\u2019t waste my time.", "YTA. Sorry, but if I had a SO and they did this to me, I\u2019ll divorce them, hell, this is literally *property damage*, considering you BURNT things that weren\u2019t even yours to begin with and that should warrant police being involved. \n\nThere is no time limit for grief, many people would go as far as for the rest of their lives to grief someone so close, like their parent. Hell, I keep my paternal grandfather\u2019s watch that I got as some sort of an inheritance in a box, which is kept safe in my shelf, and I refuse to wear it over grief and regret for not calling him on his birthday just before he died (and mind you, I was not informed about his health).

If she wasn\u2019t ready to let things go you could have gotten a storage unit. It\u2019s so incredibly painful to go through things that you inherit from a loved one who has passed. As her husband of eight years that loves her so deeply you could have had some compassion for her.\n\nI understand the frustration of the hoarding situation, my parents have a major issue with keeping useless things to the point of mildly hoarding and I\u2019m constantly bugging them about going through it all which I agree can be extremely stressful. \n\nBut in your situation, it\u2019s only been a few months. She had to empty her mothers house and sell it quickly, which can be somewhat traumatic alongside losing someone as important as a mother. Simply getting rid of things she cherished without her consent was toxic and selfish. \n\nAs you point out, the house belongs to both of you and she has the right to keep things there.

I get that she's sad, but I've repeatedly asked her to sort through these boxes because we can't keep on living like this. She said she wasn't ready to throw/give away things that had been dear to her mother and asked me to give her more time. Mind you, her mother died in January so it's been months already.\n\nYesterday when she was at work, I finally had enough. I went through the boxes myself. I threw away everything that was useless and burnt everything (but photos) that was made out of paper or similar material. I managed to empty out the shed and clear my office of her things.\n\nI did expect her to be a bit upset, but she went livid when she got home. She kept crying for hours and wouldn't speak to me. Now she's saying she wants me to go to my parents' because she \"can't stand to look at me\". I pointed out we own this house together and that she can't just kick me out.

Your wife was essentially hoarding her parents' possessions as she didn't want to let them go but was storing them in places that only impacted you and not her.  That was not fair to you.

Your wife is obviously struggling with their deaths and getting rid of the stuff without her invlovement is just going to make the road to acceptance much harder.  What you should have done is move all the stuff out of the shed and your office, and placed it in a shared area like the living room.  Then when your wife came home sit her down and tell her you two need to figure out what to do with this stuff once and for all.  Keep the important things but surely she doesn't need her mother's shirt she saw her wear once on a Tuesday.", "ESH except you can't really say a woman trapped in untreated grief and a man trapped in a burgeoning hoard are assholes exactly. More like life can be cruel?\n\nYou're trying to stay married and you've inadvertently ended up living with a hoarder as her grief has gotten stuck. Insist on a grief counselor and an OCD therapist. If she refuses treatment, try a legal separation into two separate living situations. If you really want to stay married to this person and she won't get treatment or it doesn't work (and if this flowers into full hoarding the treatment outcomes aren't great) your choice may be to live in a hoard or buy/rent a separate space. \n\nLastly I would have recommended a visit to a divorce attorney. Living in a hoard, with someone who's treatment resistant, is miserable. I've seen a family member go through it.

If she continued being unreasonable, then NAH.", "NTA - I have a sister that bought a huge storage shed when my mother passed and put tons of her stuff in there.

You should not have burned anything without consulting her and that was wrong, but it is understandable given her lack of action.

Yeah, I'd never trust someone who did something like this, again. Pretty sure what you did was also illegal, because inheritance isn't shared marital property.

What I do know, from my own experiences on both sides of the issue, is that when you're dealing with something you really don't want to deal with, six months becomes a year quite easily, which becomes two years quite easily, and so on. Hoarding behavior, regardless of it's motivation, very rarely clears up on it's own with time, because in a way it's actually a method of trying to exert control over or avoid dealing with loss.
