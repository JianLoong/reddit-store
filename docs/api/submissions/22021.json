I love her dearly.\n\nHer mother (my mil) passed away in January. They were close and it's been hard for her, especially as her dad passed away a long time ago when she was little and she doesn't have any siblings. She feels like she needs to keep her \"family history\" alive which has led into a hoarding situation. Basically, when her mother passed, my wife had a hard time letting go. We emptied the mil's house and managed to sell it, but my wife insisted on keeping several boxes of \"family heirlooms\" (dish wear, lamps, books etc. mostly useless things but important to her) and ordinary things that belonged to her mother (dresses, shoes, pillows, albums etc).\n\nFor months, these boxes filled our storage room, an entire wall of our living room, one corner of my office, two kitchen cabinets and our shed. I get that she's sad, but I've repeatedly asked her to sort through these boxes because we can't keep on living like this. She said she wasn't ready to throw/give away things that had been dear to her mother and asked me to give her more time. Mind you, her mother died in January so it's been months already.\n\nYesterday when she was at work, I finally had enough. I went through the boxes myself. I threw away everything that was useless and burnt everything (but photos) that was made out of paper or similar material. I managed to empty out the shed and clear my office of her things.\n\nI did expect her to be a bit upset, but she went livid when she got home. She kept crying for hours and wouldn't speak to me. Now she's saying she wants me to go to my parents' because she \"can't stand to look at me\". I pointed out we own this house together and that she can't just kick me out. I understand she needs time, but I need my living space. And ultimately I was just trying to help her to move on.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nedit: Okay so I want to clear up some things: I didn't throw away *everything*. I only cleared up the shed and my office, the two places I use the most. She still has plenty of boxes elsewhere in the house. And I didn't *burn* everything either.

People get hit by the parents passing away and sometimes it can take years to go over it (and not completely). \n\nYou threw it and BURNED IT AWAY? Are you for real?

There is no time limit on grief. If she wasn't ready to go through them, she wasn't. Who are you to decide it's been enough time? Have you any empathy? You burned the paper items?

If she wasn\u2019t ready to let things go you could have gotten a storage unit. It\u2019s so incredibly painful to go through things that you inherit from a loved one who has passed.

I love her dearly.\n\nHer mother (my mil) passed away in January. They were close and it's been hard for her, especially as her dad passed away a long time ago when she was little and she doesn't have any siblings. She feels like she needs to keep her \"family history\" alive which has led into a hoarding situation. Basically, when her mother passed, my wife had a hard time letting go. We emptied the mil's house and managed to sell it, but my wife insisted on keeping several boxes of \"family heirlooms\" (dish wear, lamps, books etc. mostly useless things but important to her) and ordinary things that belonged to her mother (dresses, shoes, pillows, albums etc).\n\nFor months, these boxes filled our storage room, an entire wall of our living room, one corner of my office, two kitchen cabinets and our shed. I get that she's sad, but I've repeatedly asked her to sort through these boxes because we can't keep on living like this. She said she wasn't ready to throw/give away things that had been dear to her mother and asked me to give her more time. Mind you, her mother died in January so it's been months already.\n\nYesterday when she was at work, I finally had enough. I went through the boxes myself. I threw away everything that was useless and burnt everything (but photos) that was made out of paper or similar material. I managed to empty out the shed and clear my office of her things.\n\nI did expect her to be a bit upset, but she went livid when she got home. She kept crying for hours and wouldn't speak to me. Now she's saying she wants me to go to my parents' because she \"can't stand to look at me\". I pointed out we own this house together and that she can't just kick me out. I understand she needs time, but I need my living space. And ultimately I was just trying to help her to move on.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why bother having a discussion or engaging in therapy when you can go ahead and destroy someone's entire life like it meant nothing at all.

Good luck to you.", "ESH but you more than her.  Your wife was essentially hoarding her parents' possessions as she didn't want to let them go but was storing them in places that only impacted you and not her.  That was not fair to you.  You should not have destroyed anything, even if they were useless scrap paper with no significance.  Your wife is obviously struggling with their deaths and getting rid of the stuff without her invlovement is just going to make the road to acceptance much harder.  What you should have done is move all the stuff out of the shed and your office, and placed it in a shared area like the living room.  Then when your wife came home sit her down and tell her you two need to figure out what to do with this stuff once and for all.  Keep the important things but surely she doesn't need her mother's shirt she saw her wear once on a Tuesday.", "ESH except you can't really say a woman trapped in untreated grief and a man trapped in a burgeoning hoard are assholes exactly. More like life can be cruel?\n\nYou're trying to stay married and you've inadvertently ended up living with a hoarder as her grief has gotten stuck. Insist on a grief counselor and an OCD therapist. If she refuses treatment, try a legal separation into two separate living situations. If you really want to stay married to this person and she won't get treatment or it doesn't work (and if this flowers into full hoarding the treatment outcomes aren't great) your choice may be to live in a hoard or buy/rent a separate space. \n\nLastly I would have recommended a visit to a divorce attorney.

As we went through everything, she told me something she remembered about it, smiled, and put it in the pile of things to be disposed of. She said the memories of those things were important. Not the things themselves. And she didn\u2019t need the latter to maintain the former.

This is where I think you have a legit gripe - its unreasonable to turn your home into a storage unit for months because the wife refuses to deal with the situation. Burning things without consulting her? That's pretty asshole.

This can't be real.", "YTA. I completely understand how frustrating & helpless you feel living in a hoarding situation. I know it\u2019s bad.\nBut in my experience (as a reformed former hoarder) this is a mental health issue for your wife. My hoarding kicked in too after a death of someone very close & I felt completely powerless, shocked & devastated. What it took for me to sort it out was me WANTING to sort it out. If someone had come and took it & burnt it, I would have been devastated. I would have hoarded the rest of the stuff to the extreme. You did it behind her back & took her power away which is not really the way to go with hoarders. \n\nI do appreciate how horrid it is to live like this & I doubt your wife is enjoying it either, it\u2019s really not nice. You just drown in the clutter & it seems too big to sort through because of the emotional attachment. The only advice I would have given you (before you blew the whole thing up) would be to seek help and advice from a mental health charity specialising in hoarding, on how to move forward. Burning papers was totally unnecessary. The way forward is you and your wife TOGETHER going through and photographing each piece before disposal, not setting it on fire for god sake. Again, I know you shouldn\u2019t have to live like this. But you\u2019ve massively broken her trust while she\u2019s grieving & if she stays with you there will be an awful lot of resentment.\n\nIt CAN get better. She CAN get better. But not when you take control in such an aggressive way. Totally understand your frustration but you must know this wasn\u2019t the right approach. \n\nIncidentally, I got past my hoarding when I kicked my partner out & ended my relationship. The hoarding started because of a shock bereavement (suicide of someone very dear to me) but I am sure it continued and escalated because my relationship was so dire & I\u2019d been totally unsupported while I grieved & the resentment was terrible. I wasn\u2019t in the headspace to clear house when I was living with such an insensitive pr1ck. I threw him out & something in my head snapped,  I worked flat out for a fortnight, my home was & still is pretty much immaculate.", "Why would you do that to her? Just WHY?

Up until this point in the story I thought he was going to say he moved them to a different location or something but throwing them away while she\u2019s at work and ***burning*** nearly everything? What the fuck man lmao\n\nIt\u2019s even worse that he acknowledged that he knew it was important to her", "His wife has NO FAMILY. The thing that finally made me cry when my hated MIL passed was when my son got upset because \"daddy's an orphan now\".", "Also, he either has no empathy or doesn\u2019t like his parents.

She lost her parent and they sold the house -- she essentially has no parents and only the marital house and he decided to RUB THAT IN HER FACE! I'm fuming here!", "It was punishment for her not listening to him and going through the boxers sooner. In his eyes he's justified and if it hurt her, that was to teach a lesson. \n\nEmotionally Abusive. 0 empathy.", "This. Him labeling her as a hoarder from the get go made me so angry. She wasn\u2019t continuously piling up stuff and bringing in more and more junk. She just wanted the boxes of things of her mother\u2019s life. He was using the term to try to justify the need to forcibly remove the stuff. This post belongs on AmITheDevil.", "I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my dad several years ago and was struggling to part with any of his clothes.  I picked out some my favorite pieces that I would see him in often and my mom made them into a quilt.  It's so nice to have something I can use and appreciate and have the memories associated with.  I really do recommend. <3", "The worst part about that line is the wife doesn\u2019t have parents to go to so she essentially has no where else to go to be away from her husband while he can but won\u2019t leave", "His wife lost her Mom five months ago.  This equals no time for grief and processing. Not only are you the AH but I would wager that you still have both parents and have never lost a close friend.

I can\u2019t believe your marriage will survive this", "Seriously it's so outlandish I hope it isn't real.", "The moment I gasped out loud and dropped my jaw was when OP said they *burned* things. I mean, wow!", "So sorry for your loss. My dad died in Nov 2021 and I\u2019m still heartbroken. If anyone burned his things\u2026. I don\u2019t even know what I would do.

It's been five years. Grief takes time.", "Agree.  It took my wife over 3 years to move on from the loss of a loved one.  She needed the space, we gave it to her, and it worked out.  OP is overly impatient, inconsiderate and a bit selfish.  \n\nOP is YTA", "It's been 5 years for me, and everything's still in his closet. I like to bury my face in his shirts. They still smell like him. \n\nMy deepest sympathies to you.", "I have stuff from my beloved. He passed away 4 years ago, there's no time limit. \ud83d\udc9c", "But that would cost an ungodly $12 a month! A clearly outrageous sum. No, clearly burning his grieving wife's inherited posessions is the best solution.\n\nI cannot imagine how selfish you would have to be to think like this, fuck if you're annoyed by all the stuff take charge and offer to help, don't burn their stuff like an absolute monster", "I think the real issue here is that OP is mad that his wife is focusing on something/someone that isn't him. That was a real problem for him, and after 6 months of not being the sole focus of her attention, he'd had enough. Time to get rid of anything that reminds her of that other thing that's not him, so she can go back to what's important: focusing on him.", "He could have also just been a fucking adult and had a conversation with his wife and said \u201cHoney, we really need to begin going through these things and organizing them. We can\u2019t just live amongst these stacks of boxes\u201d and then helped her sort through the stuff.", "Even if it had been a year or even 2+ years, it would not excuse what he did. You can't put a timeline on healing from the loss of someone close to you let alone a parent you're close to. It just isn't possible. Everyone grieves differently and takes different lengths of time to mend themselves back together. But no matter how long they may need to take, they will always have a scar there where they once were whole and nobody can take that from them or make it better. I still grieve my dad and cry from missing him and it's been 17 years. My husband lost his mom a year ago and he still is processing his grief. Never and I mean NEVER in a million years would I do to my husband what OP did to his wife. OP is just plain heartless.", "That blows my mind (heh). Our sons are grown with their own homes, and we still have some of their things stored in boxes here at \"home-home\" (as we all refer to it). I can't imagine getting rid of their stuff...happy to hang on as long as they need or want us to.", "And who know what important family history or information was lost when OP burned the papers.", "I have a little toothpick holder. It has some chipped edges and can actually be a little dangerous if you're not careful (sharp) but it sat on my parents counter as long as I could remember and even though we're not regular toothpick users, it still is in my kitchen and always will be.", "It's the little things... I have the plastic stamp dispenser my grandfather used.  I'm sure it cost less than 25 cents when he bought it, but he used it, and then my mother used it, and now I'm using it.  To anyone else it's an old ugly discolored plastic stamp dispenser.  To me it's Grandpa and Mom.", "So much this. When my MIL passed, we had 60 days to clear out her apartment (she was in assisted living). I was a SAHM, so I did the bulk of the clearing. Even though I hated her, and she hated me more, it was still hard. My now-ex was her only child, and had no other living family except our three children. So many things that I could have just tossed out I put into boxes for him to go through himself, because I didn't know if it was something that would be of significance to him. She's been gone 11 years, and I don't think he's gone through those boxes yet.   \nOP is definitely the AH, and just all around mean.", "Wow, that's unbelievable. What a jerk...I hope she dumped him instead", "Especially if it\u2019s hot where OP is right now. That would mean he specifically built the fire to burn the things his wife cherishes. That\u2019s so malicious and cruel.", "Yeah, this is.... Pathological levels of *not okay*", "I hope he never marries again. He shouldn\u2019t inflict himself on some unsuspecting woman.", "Yeah. Most AITA can be fixed with an apology and an acceptance of being in the doghouse for a bit.  \n\nBut there is quite literally nothing he can do to fix this.  Nothing.\n\nDivorce is the only same solution here.", "I agree. I rarely immediately think \u201cDIVORCE!!\u201d but I absolutely did this time. How can she ever trust him again? He loves her so much that he had such a hard time dealing with a few crowded areas that he set the items on fire?! This was intentionally cruel. He wanted to make sure she couldn\u2019t retrieve them from a bin or such. Burning is so final!", "Yeah, these emotionally abusive types never stop.", "I don\u2019t ever \u201chope\u201d for anyone to separate but she literally has no fucking family I hope she divorces his ass.

I'm sure it varies widely by location, but WOW.  I'm in the Boston area, and I don't know of anywhere you can get a 5x10 unit for less than around $100 a month.", "I live in a lcol/mcol and the cheapest storage unit here runs about $100 a month. Yes he still should\u2019ve prioritized it but it isn\u2019t cheap either Mz", "Yes. A divorce lawyer is a lot more expensive. Or general asshole tax", "For a whole year after I lost my mom I would look at the moon at night and wish to die.  For him to not jus throw away, BUT TO BURN, treasured items of hers, I\u2019d be gone.", "It's been almost 10 years since my mom passed.

It\u2019s been almost 19 years and I still have 3 or 4 boxes of her things. Never in a million years would my husband suggest getting rid of anything much less do it behind my back.", "I was the same way with the tissues after my mom died. Especially because the smallest things could set me off. Hell, I'd see a TV commercial that she liked and would start sobbing.", "Some of my mother's things are still in my guest room.  She died more than 20 years ago.  My theory is that if she comes back she'll need them (I know she's not coming back) and if she doesn't, anyone who stays with me who fits into them can have what they want.  So far her grandkids have made a huge dent into what was left, and I know she'd love that.", "Did you also get the recipie?", "Or poetry, stories, maybe even the wife's report cards that her mom might've saved. All things that she'll never know because SHE didn't get to go through it herself.", "You\u2019re exactly right. She lost her mother young, and her father even younger. OP definitely sucks!", "You summed it up really well. Finding something like an old checkbook cleaning out the closet at my parents' house and seeing all of the receipts in my mom's handwriting will give me a rush of memories, sights, smells, sounds, even tastes from my childhood when she was alive. It's about more than just the object itself. I really hope this is a fake one.", "I don't know what the waste management is like where OP is, but I'm struggling to comprehend why burning what he deemed unwanted paper was the first option? Like, was a garbage/recycling bin not an option (where it could have been retrieved).\n\n\nAs I typed this I realised that no, OP wanted a final solution. This doesn't have much to do with 'cluttering everything to do with control, doesn't it?", "\u201cIt\u2019s been months! Months, I tell you! Shouldn\u2019t she be over this??\u201d My father died 20 years ago and I still have a hard time looking through some of his things but my god, I\u2019m so grateful that I HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO SO.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a great deal of stuff, but that\u2019s what happens when BOTH parents are dead, FFS. If his parents were dead, he\u2019d have a ton of shit in their house too. What an absolute asshole.", "No, OP says they sold the house\u2026I hope all the money went into the wife\u2019s account and not a joint account as he had no right to it unless it was left to him in his MIL\u2019s will.", "There is absolutely no rush.  At 5 years I am still trudging along.  There are days that I just close the door to the storage room and walk away.  \n\nDismantling a shared life alone is a real bitch.", "There is absolutely no need for you to rush and clean the closet.

Also, feel free to hang on to what you want. Loss takes time and no one has the same amount of time.

She put her makeup on downstairs, and upstairs had a small closet beside a dresser. On top of the dresser was a table runner, that had a jewlery box, jewlery chest, and a dish for rings and pins. She would get ready here every day, morning at the dresser, and all of her silk night outfits and church clothes in her closet. \n\nMy great grandfather lived for 8 years after her passing, and he never cleaned her closet or bedside table out. His children sort of made him clean other areas of the house and he did feel better. He kept the closet, dresser, and her bedside table set up (current night reading book on top and bible inside the drawer) for years, eventually changing what was on top and what was inside the dresser. He gave away some jewlery from that box to their kids and some grandkids, but he never gave away any of her clothes. It never felt right to him.
