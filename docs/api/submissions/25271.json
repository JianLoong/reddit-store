I was in the bathroom and by the time I got to the door, there wasn\u2019t anyone there. This happened again about 10 minutes later and again I wasn\u2019t able to catch who did it. \nAbout an hour later, I heard what seemed like someone trying to enter my apartment (the handle was violently jiggled.)\n\nI have two dogs. I am currently mourning the loss of my partner who died a few weeks ago. My two  dogs are still confused and waiting for him to come home. When they heard someone trying to open  the door, I think they assumed it was my partner. They excitedly ran to the door and it broke my heart. I ran to the door too to see who was at the door. I opened my door to see three guys briskly walking away. I ran up to them and went off on them. \n\nI yelled, \u201cwhat the fuck are doing?\u201d They all just stared at me. So I asked \u201cwhy did you try entering my apartment?\u201d One of the guys said \u201cbro what are you talking about?\u201d  I said, \u201ccut the bullshit, I know it was you.\u201d Another one of the guys said \u201cokay you got us.\u201d So I said, okay well I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d\n\nThe guy said, \u201cfor what? Playing a prank?\u201d I said, \u201cfor trying to break into my apartment and harassing me.\u201d One of the guys said, \u201cbro you can\u2019t be fucking serious. It\u2019s literally not that deep. Also, my bro lied. We weren\u2019t the ones who knocked on your door. So chill the fuck out.\u201d I told them no I wouldn\u2019t be chilling out and that I was calling the police.\u201d One of the guys said \u201cthe fuck you are psycho.\u201d And ran off. The others followed. \n\nI did call the police and they took a report, but the building doesn\u2019t have cameras in the halls for \u201cprivacy reasons\u201d so there wasn\u2019t much they could do. I thought everything was done with until Monday when the manager of the building asked to meet with me. She is saying that one of the guys filed a complaint about me saying that I was harassing him and his friends  and yelling unreasonably at him. Dude is asking for a apology. \n\nAita here?\n\nEdit: to address some common comments.\n\nI had a long talk with the manager. She knows everything that happened. She thinks I\u2019m over reacting and tried to talk me out of keeping the police involved. \n\nAlso, I am not allowed to install a ring camera.", "created_utc": 1692723056, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ybgq5/aita_for_going_off_on_people_trying_to_enter_my/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if it was a prank, it was a dangerous and terrifying one. Imagine if you had been armed, or if they had actually gotten in. No sensible adult would do this.\n\nFile a complaint as well with your building manager and tell her you feel uncomfortable apologizing to the man who harassed you and tried to break into your home. Provide the police report if necessary. I would also suggest a doorbell camera if your building manager refuses to put in cameras in the hallways. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.

These are college students who should know better.

They're marketed to people who travel, to put on their hotel room doors, I've seen them on amazon. Get one of those and if the alarm goes off enough times that might keep people from jiggling it. \n\nMaybe you can get one of those \"ring\" devices, though that might be forbidden due to the no cameras policy.

I get you were angry, I would be too if someone basically tried getting into my apartment. Your dogs\u2019 reaction was so sad. I think everything combined, it was just too much. It would be for anyone. So NAH, but do not call the police next time, and is there a rule about fake cameras? You can hang a fake ring doorbell without hooking it up to your phone, with permission of the manager of course. I wish you the very best.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, your situation may be different depending on your state and local policy. \n\nYou can also install a camera inside your unit facing the door. This would capture any attempts to turn the knob. \n\nYour building manager is justifying bad behavior on other tenants behalf. She cannot force you to apologize.
