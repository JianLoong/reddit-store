To this day if I heard the people that bullied me died in a fire I would do a little dance. \n\nTell you're teacher she has a duty of care to keep students safe and placing you with the people who harass and assault you (that's what bullying is called when you're not in school) is not taking your well being into consideration. \n\nDon't work with them. Do it on your own if you have to.

It's a win/win. You don't have to work with your bullies, and they get penalized for bullying you.

There can be no team effort with bullies.", "NTA but you should have a conversation with your teacher about being bullied. If she doesnt listen go to the principals office and ask what you should do. It isnt acceptable. What does your parents say?", "NTA for the bullies. They're lucky they *only* lost 10 points. I would have done the entire thing, documented their lack of contribution, and left them staring down a big fat \"F\" on the project.\n\nI'm curious what you said to your teacher, though. Any half-decent teacher would recognize that in the real world, you would have actual recourse for dealing with hostile coworkers.", "NTA honestly I don't understand how teachers still don't see bullying for what it is. It's ignorant of your teacher to diminish your experiences just because your teacher doesn't see what's going on. Why do teachers STILL do this? Lol \n\nI swear teachers never know what's going on and then when somebody tells them, they don't believe or care. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA - Sorry for what happened to you \nYour teacher is wrong \nThe bullies get what they deserve", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hate school group projects.  I fully understand that adults have to learn to work with co-workers/ people they dislike. If the there is a big enough problem, adults go to their manager or HR. You went to your teacher with a problem and her suggestions were to ignore their bullying and make a team effort with them.  Absolutely no help at all!  If my kid came to me with this concern, you can bet your ass that I would be on the phone with the teacher ASAP. The teacher/school needs to fix that bullying situation and my student's project will not be docked 10 points off the top.", "NTA and your teacher is an idiot.", "Their parents donate a lot of money to the school and are very wealthy they can do whatever they want unfortunately", "Trust me snitching would only make it worse, I'm moving school soon anyway so I'm just trying to survive the next 6 weeks with his little drama as possible", "wtf seriously, it's like in a drama. Good luck op  with your next school!", "I was bullied for 12 yrs. That is not snitching. That is a teacher who obviously doesnt notice what is going on in the class and should be aware of it!
