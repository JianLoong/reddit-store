You wrote the letter so many years ago in terms of growth, maturity, etc. It was an opportunity to reflect on it and remind yourself of your young tribulations (which we all take with a grain of salt as adults unless they were abusive). Your mom has taken that opportunity and will make it about herself (according to you), so just bite the bullet and call her out.", "This is something my mother absolutely would do.
