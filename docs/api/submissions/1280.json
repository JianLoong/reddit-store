We like recycling the candles we have at home, by remelting the wax and making more not for profit but because we enjoy it and we read a study showing that all those candles are supposedly bad for the environment, so we recycle what we can. My father, 39, doesn't like this hobby as much as we do, because according to him it's a waste of electricity and for a country in an energy crisis, he thinks it's unwise to spend so much energy on melting the wax, which takes quite some time to melt.\n\nThe issue is that the way he makes his tea, it takes a long time to 'properly infuse the flavour'. He has the heat very high, for a long time, and he has tea every single day, while I make candles around once every two-three months. My mother pointed this out to me and was very annoyed when my father came into the room today, complaining heavily about the mess this was going to make and the energy consumption, proceeding to argue with him and shout back about his tea. This eventually resulted in my father throwing out his tea, me spilling scalding hot wax onto my hand and an argument between my parents. \n\nMy brother, 21, told me that I shouldn't have made the candles, that I should know my father doesn't like it, that it wastes a lot of my time which I could spend studying (note, I do study quite a lot, it's not that I'm an unmotivated student). He also said that both my parents are currently very busy with work and are on edge with everything, and my candles really threw them over the edge. I understand that perhaps it is time-consuming, but I do enjoy it, and so does my mother, who encouraged me to make them. I told my brother as much, and he's currently very irritated with me and not speaking. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667585616, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym63bj/aita_for_making_candles/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
