Does he have to watch his son solo on the weekends that he has free so you can go do something on your own? Can you go spend thousands of dollars on something you want to go do without him?\n\nSorry, missing that trip is the cost of being a parent. Dude needs to grow up and get his priorities straight. NTA.", "NTA You have to reorder your priorities when you become a parent. Your child and family come first. And, they definitely come before a social club and a two week road trip.", "NTA. Going on 2 week motorcycle road trips whenever you want is one of many freedoms you give up when you have a child. And that's ignoring what a dubious financial decision it is.", "I'm pregnant, and if my partner ever had the audacity to tell me he is up and leaving me and our newborn for two weeks, he would not have a home to come back to.\n\nI can go off about priorities, and partnership, but you know all that.\n\nSo instead, I suggest you telling him you're going on a two week trip and he will have to stay home with your baby.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your boyfriend needs to start accepting the responsibility of fatherhood", "NTA. When you have children, the children and their wellbeing has to be prioritized over your own wants and needs as a parent. Your boyfriend wanted to go off on a trip that was both financially ill-advised and saddled you with an unreasonable burden (not to mention put you in financial jeopardy by not being able to work without him for childcare). It's too bad that he couldn't recognize on his own that he shouldn't go, but as long as he's not still holding it against you, I would just count it as a lesson learned early on in parenthood and let it go.", "NTA - He didn't have the money to go on the trip. That is not your fault. \n\nIf he is giving you a hard time about this or making you feel bad, then you and he need to have a serious conversation about him taking personal responsibility for his finances and financial commitments. You should not have to \"be the bad guy\" or the \"nagging girlfriend\" every time he wants to do something that is financially irresponsible.", "NTA\n\nWhen you have kids your priorities need to change, and this trip would have put him further into debt, so he couldn't really afford it in the first place. I'm glad he came to this decision on his own after you had a talk about it, shows maturity on his part.", "NTA. Welcome to parenthood.", "\"I knew he was upset he missed this once in a lifetime trip with his friends.\"\n\nnta, as you get older you'll probably notice how these \"once in a lifetime\" trips happen rather frequently and there will be plenty of future opportunities.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like the right time for him to be doing all of this. If he loves his family, he'll be understanding and won't hold a grudge for cancelling his trip. There will be plenty of time in the future to go on motorcycle trips.", "NTA. Adulting is hard, but he's a father now so it's time he got used it. Don't say \"you made him miss a trip \" because the reality is that he should have made that decision on his own.", "NTA\n\nHe's a father now, his family needs to be a higher priority.", "NTA\n\n\nHe is a father and equally responsible for the child. \"Informing you\" doesn't work.", "NTA. When you have a kid you have to learn to sacrifice things. The club may be fun for him but at what cost ? Spending no time with his family and being in debt ?", "NTA. He can be sad about missing out, but when you're already in debt, living with your girlfriend's mom, and have a baby at home, you don't get to just fuck off for an expensive (and dangerous) 2 week vacation.", "NTA\n\nyour son is his son too. Your bf shouldnt be spending weekends away from the family when you have a young child to look after and he shouldn't be spending money you dont have. So what if he's sad he missed out on a trip, he is not a schoolkid.", "NTA.  When you become a parent your priorities must change.  The child comes first.  That's not saying people need to give up everything they enjoy, but they do have to rearrange things to accommodate everyone involved as best they can.", "NTA. He\u2019s a dad, he needs to take this seriously. Of course he can still have hobbies but he needs to ensure also that he is financially in a good space and responsible", "NTA You didn't make him miss his trip. He chose to become a parent too and with that comes sacrifices. Sometimes it means choosing between spending your money on something you need vs want. Or having to choose between staying home vs a vacation. \nI wanted to add this time goes by faster than you realize. I'm now married with teenagers that have their own active lives. We spend family time together but my husband and I do have a lot of freedom (and more funds) to go do all those fun things we haven't been able to for a long time. We are enjoying ourselves but sometimes I miss those baby days. Soak it all up, enjoy it for the time that it is, and tell your man to do the same.", "NTA.  He chose to be a father than being selfish.", "NTA things like this are a part of growing up and prioritizing responsibilities before fun. In a few years when your son is a bit older and y\u2019all are in a more stable position maybe he can rejoin. Right now though it is inconsiderate of him to take two weeks for a motorcycle trip and spend money he doesn\u2019t have on a motorcycle club. \n\nI don\u2019t think he should lose the bike though because it is probably more fuel efficient for his back and forth to work.", "NTA.

You've tolerated a lot of his MC commitments, but there is a limit.", "Info: Is this his kid aswell? I noticed you only referred to him as \"your son\".", "NTA\n\nYour kid is less than a year old. Your boyfriend has to learn that he's a parent now and that his kid needs to come first, whether that's physically looking after him while you're working or whether it's financial help. How on Earth was he even going to afford it anyway if it was going to be \"a few grand\" and he was already \"a few grand\" in debt?", "NTA.  These are the things you give up when you have responsibilities; like a newborn and debt.  It\u2019s sad yes, but if he wants to be do fun things he sure as shit better have his priorities taken care of.", "NTA. Responsibilities. To you, to your kid. It sucks but maybe when he gets his shite together he can rejoin the club.", "I would rephrase that last paragraph.  You are both young enough for that to NOT be the last opportunity of a \"lifetime\" for a trip like that.  You may not see this now, but bumps like these are part of growing up and being a partner in a relationship with a child.  You should let him know how proud you are of him in making a decision for the family instead of just himself.  Then you both should sit down and mutually set your goals.  Which in time would include him being able to eventually spend more time in a motorcycle club.  That time just doesn't happen to be right now.

He had a kid, his priorities should change.  That said, he shouldn\u2019t have to give up hobbies or passions.  You two need to talk and allow space to both live your lives while collectively handling your responsibilities.", "NTA, I may have let him go on  the trip and then asked him to stop, but he was putting the club above family and it was taking to much time and money.\n\nEach person should have a hobby, but having to spend a certain amount of time a month makes it a job, not a hobby.", "NAH.  When you have kids you tend to lose out on stuff you did as a no kids adult.  Your bf made the right choice to save his money for his kid and gave up something he loves for it.", "NAH he can make this trip later, you shouldn't feel bad for acting like an adult.
