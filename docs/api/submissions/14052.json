She's an only child and also the first and only grandchild to my parents. Ever since she was younger my brother, SIL and parents gave her every and anything she wanted, never said no to her, you get the gist. \n\nDue to this now at 15 she is NIGHTMARE to deal with. Everyone just basically gives her whatever she wants because you know, \"she's the baby\".\n\nMy husband (42M) and I are child free by choice. We both have good careers and do very well for ourselves. I've always had an expensive taste when it came to clothing, jewelry, bags etc. (Important for later).\n\nA few weeks ago my husband and I went over to my parents house for a family lunch. My brother, SIL and niece were there too. The conversations were mainly catered around my niece because her birthday was approaching. My parents asked her what she wanted for her birthday this year?\n\nShe told them that she wanted this specific designer bag worth around $2,200 usd. My parents were completely taken aback and kind of started laughing telling my niece that's a bit excessive and there's no way they're spending that kind of money on a bag.\n\nMy niece then turned to my husband and I and said \"well you guys can get it for me then, you're rich but yet you always get me cheap gifts\". My husband and I were both taken aback (the gifts we get her aren't \"cheap\" at all) at how ungrateful and rude she was acting. And also the sheer audacity of a 15 year old demanding I get her a thousand dollar bag.\n\nMy SIL jumped in the conversation saying how I have all these bags, and \"flaunting\" then around my niece is only going to make her want them. So pretty much saying, I made my bed lie in it and get her the bag.\n\nI think they left the conversation think they guilt tripped me into getting her the bag, well they were wrong. I hopped on one of those designer dupe wholesale websites, ordered the bag for like $60 usd. The bag came in like 2 weeks later, I wrapped the gift and brought it to my niece's birthday party.\n\nFast forward she saw mine and my husband gift and got super excited, she opened her gift  and immediately her face dropped. She turned red in the face (you could tell the bag was a dupe). She asked us \"what is this, is this a joke?\" I said \"no, this is your gift. Maybe in the future you should be grateful for the gifts we get you. It's not the price that matter, it's the thought\".\n\nMy niece started crying calling us \"cheap\" and \"embarrassing\", my SIL had some not so nice words either. My brother, SIL and parents are upset because I \"let down\" my niece, and think I should apologize. I think she needed to be humbled, and that her parents should encourage her to apologize for my husband and I for demanding us to buy her the bag in the first place.

I would've been like, \"Excuse me?\" No one is entitled to gifts, especially obnoxiously expensive ones at 15. And SIL, I can buy expensive bags because I work hard for them. Maybe you should be teaching your daughter the same.\"\n\nSo ESH b/c the dupe didn't teach her a lesson and just caused an argument. Grandparents and parents are AHs because spoiling your children lead to this: spoiled, rude, entitled brats that expect everything to be handed to them w/o having to put in any work.", "ESH.  The proper way to \"humble\" this child was to tell her she was spoiled and entitled and that you would not be getting her a $2000 bag and if a \"cheap\" gift wasn't good enough for her, you wouldn't get her a gift at all.  You could have chosen that road, the road filled with truth and integrity.  Instead, you played games with her and \"Haha\" you won.  Now she just thinks you're assholes and hasn't learned a darn thing.  She's probably right, even if she is a spoiled brat.  Your brother and SIL are terrible parents for raising her to be an entitled brat.  You don't have to defend yourself for buying yourself nice things, you've earned it.  You know how they say two wrongs do not make a right?  Two assholes just equals two assholes.", "INFO: how, specifically, did you think buying her a knock off that would obviously just be thrown away was going to \u201chumble her?\u201d", "Just stop buying her anything altogether.", "This will probably be an unpopular opinion but I think ESH.  Your niece and her family are much more TA than you are.  But the way you handled it seemed like you were at her maturity level rather than acting like an adult.  As an adult, you should be able to set boundaries, clearly tell her no, and get her something that you consider reasonable (or don't get her anything and tell her politely sorry that you couldn't meet her expectations).  Or, you know, politely decline the birthday party.", "ESH. Does that humble her? How? They spoiled her, so they are AHs for sure. But, your gift helped nothing. Humbling her would be taking her to volunteer at a women's shelter or to feed the homeless. Your gift did nothing to teach her anything, especially since it was a thoughtless gift. So, you can't even say the thought is what matters.", "I swear these posts always feel fake based on the sheer audacity of everyone involved. Your niece for demanding a $2000 purse, her parents for backing her that she not only deserves one but that you should be the one to purchase it because obviously she'd never have wanted one without you flaunting yours /s, and her grandparents for contributing to the creation of this human seagull shouting \"Mine! Mine! Mine!\"\n\nPretty sure most people are going to say NAH after you painted such a horrible picture of all of them because, from my observations, that's how it works here. But, damn, your response comes off as both petty and pious, and I could just hear your \"triumphant\"  voice as you taught her this critical life lesson. \n\nYou could have done it with a simple \"I'm sorry. I don't think a 15 year old girl needs a $2000 bag. And I really don't like being pressured to get it for her while also being told what we gave her in the past wasn't appreciated. If you keep pushing it, then it's time for us to go and we'll just take a pass on the birthday celebration this year.\" Then follow through because providing an audience for this behavior for 15 years contributed to who she is now.\n\nESH. Your niece is exactly what your family mindlessly created. Thank you. I appreciate a story where I don't think I like anyone involved so there's no need to pick sides.", "You all sound just awful so I am going to blame the grandparents for creating this circle of shit.", "NTA You buying yourself luxury items does not mean your niece is entitled to your money & it doesn't mean you're flaunting it either. If your niece wants to invest her own money into a designer bag that is her choice but she doesn't get to demand one as a gift.\n\nPersonally, I wait for designers to have major sales before purchasing from them; I love high quality handbags but I'm not willing to spend more than a mortgage payment on one bag. The last one I bought was a $3k bag for $600 because it was a discontinued look (last year's color palate) & the store had 50% off for enrolling in their promotional email list.", "\"I'm sorry, sister, but your daughter is both rude and entitled, so Ill ask you to let me know in advance if she's coming to a social event, because I am not going to talk to her again.\"", "Nta. Why in the world would anyone give a teenager a 2k bag???", "ESH.  That child has obviously been failed by her parents and grandparents, but you aren't doing her any favors either by playing a prank on her at her birthday party.  Telling her \"it's not the price, it's the thought\" after deliberately giving her a prank gift is not the flex you think it is.", "I wouldn't call you an asshole but I also wouldn't have gone so far as to try and turn the gift into a teachable moment in the way that you did. Might have been more poignant to give her $100 in cash and tell her it's to start a fund to buy the bag she wants or use it for something she would rather. If you're able to drive the same point home with a child without applying your own emotions to it, always do that instead.", "NTA. Not sure how that would humble her though. Sounds like nothing changed in her our SIL expectations.", "NTA\n\nBut I would not say you teached her a lesson. I think you did it for the schadenfreude, which is somehow understanable. As others already said the parents need to take the \r  \nresponsibility and teach her how to be humble and greatful.", "NTA, you work hard for your money which you used to buy an expensive bag you like, which obviously you want to use cuz like YOU BOUGHT IT. Rude of SIL to expect you to have to buy your niece a bag too. When my mom had designer bags when i was 16, she told me i can get one too when i get a good job and work hard for it. I didn\u2019t resent her for not buying me one, just saw it as okay cool you bought yours so I\u2019m gonna buy mine. I got a job at McDonald\u2019s on weekends, saved for a few months, then my mom took me to the outlet mall and i bought one of the cheaper designer bags myself. As an adult she told me that even though she could easily afford to get me designer bag, she felt that since i was young i needed to learn the value of money so i can manage my own money better as an adult. She also said it\u2019s because when you buy your own things, you take care of them better because you know how hard you worked for those things.", "NTA, they can buy the bag for her themselves if they are so keen on a 15yo having a 2000 dollar bag...", "Definitely NTA. Everyone else, especially the niece are TA. Next time, just give her candy or nothing at all.", "NTA\n\nThe kid is a spoiled brat, she needs to face reality", "You are 40 years old and you are pranking a teenager? Pranks are so stupid and you just wasted $60.00. Must be nice to be able to do that.\nThe kid is spoiled, but it\u2019s not up to you to adjust her attitude- and at 15 they are full of attitude.\nYTA", "Esh. Yta for getting her a bag you knew she'd hate. She's an ah for being a brat. You didn't humble anyone you just created drama for the whole family to deal with. Should have got her a card with a handwritten poem about how much you love your niece if \"the thought\" is what truly counts here.", "NTA. This child needs to learn that money doesn't grow on trees.", "NTA.\nNiece & SIL are a piece of work, that\u2019s for sure.", "NTA.  My take on this is different from many - I think the real issue is your sister is jealous of the amount of money you have.  I find that when one sibling (especially a younger one) has more money than the other siblings or parents, the jealousy is expressed in weird ways - for example, when your sister said you \"flaunt\" your designer bags.  From my viewpoint, I think you should have just told your niece (in front of everyone) that you cannot justify (or whatever verb) spending over $1,000 on a gift for a teenager.  This sends a message to both your niece and your sister.  It also tells them that while you may have the money, you spend it wisely.", "Esh. Jeez stop buying her stuff. Tell her why. And stop. Don\u2019t argue it. When anyone starts arguing with you, leave.", "ESH - Everybody in this story sounds toxic. Your niece is clearly a spoiled AH who is being enabled. Your sister is also an AH for trying to shame and guilt you into buying this. Youre an AH for for playing this prank on her. Does this girl need to learn a lesson, yes. Was this funny, also yes. Your niece will not be humbled by this and it only caused animosity.", "ESH, its not your place to \"teach her a lesson\" you embarrassed her and had to get one over on a child to make yourself feel better.", "NTA - you were too generous with the fake hand bag, next time I'd give just a birthday card with $20 in it - or nothing at all in it (especially this if she doesn't apologize).  Your B and SIL handled that all wrong and are teaching their daughter material items are more important than the thought of the gift.", "NTA\n\nEverybody else in an asshole though. Maybe next time get her a miniature version of whatever she wants. Imagine how shocked she'd be to get a bag that's suitable for a doll.", "For all of those that are saying that it's not your place to teach her a lesson.\nWell somebody has to and clearly her parents are not doing it. \nNTA", "nta at all!  the entitlement of them thinking its your job to provide expensive gifts.  i personally after this wouldnt get her a gift now at all going forward.  tell her to get a job.", ">I think they left the conversation think they guilt tripped me into getting her the bag, well they were wrong.\n\nInfo: Did you at any point tell them you weren't getting the bag? Or did you just sit there and let them assume they'd convinced you?", "Info don\u2019t you find it kind of pathetic to have like a feud with a literal teenager at your age ?", "My goodness. OP I think you're the only one in your family with any sense. NTA, that was a tactful lesson. \n\nThe kid being a nightmare is bad enough but what's up with the parents?", "ESH.  The child seems like a monster of her parents\u2019 creation.  Trying to check her rather than having an uncomfortable conversation with her parents was petty, passive aggressive, and won\u2019t do anything good.  You\u2019re better off skipping the party, or showing up without a gift, than doing what you did.", "NTA, the girl is entitled. It\u2019s the thought that counts. Your family is setting her up for failure trying to get her whatever she wants. If she wants a $2,000 bag then she can start working to get one when she\u2019s older.", "NTA", "NTA at all but don\u2019t hold your breath regarding the apology. They\u2019re AHs who raised an even bigger AH. They will always blame others.", "NTA she's a brat", ">My SIL jumped in the conversation saying how I have all these bags, and \"flaunting\" then around my niece is only going to make her want them.\n\nScrew her. You have all of them because you've worked hard for them. You didn't just get stuff handed to you because you said so like in the case of your niece. This child is the pure definition of spoiled brat. And why the hell is it your responsibility to spend over $2000 on a bag for her? Tell your sister in law to buy the bag if she wants her spoiled child to have it so bad. \n\nNTA 100%. Your entire family sounds like they are all spoiled and entitled beyond belief. A $2,200 bag for a 15 year old? I owe about that much left on a car loan I've been paying off for the past 4 years. And everyone just expecting you to pay that much for something she'll just flaunt around for a few months until the next one comes out that I guarantee you she'll say \"Looks even better\". Hell, I grew up in a family were hamburger helper was considered a gourmet meal and was happy just to be fed something edible.", "ESH, although your niece has the excuse of being young. Yes, she was being spoiled and rude and ungrateful. You had absolutely no obligation or reason to get her the real bag and it probably would have been bad to do so.\n\nBut I fail to see how getting her a dupe \"teaches her a lesson\"? I don't know how this would be meant to teach her that it's the \"thought that counts\" when your thought with this gift was to disappoint and embarrass her. If anything it's going to hammer in her incorrect notion that you're cheap, and she's going to connect you not giving her huge expensive gifts with you being mean on purpose - because in this case, you were being mean on purpose. It's also going to teach her that the price *does* matter, because the cheap bag isn't even a useful gift for her since she probably doesn't want to carry around a fake.\n\nI don't think you wanted to teach her a lesson, I think you wanted to hurt her feelings and embarrass her as a punishment. It was unkind and unhelpful.", "NTA", "NTA. She deserved to be brought down a few pegs. If everyone feels so bad for this spoiled teen, you should get a fund together to buy the bag and heal her poor, broken, entitled heart.", "ESH. You really think pranking a 15 year old on their birthday is a mature way to handle yourself?", "I think instead of getting niece a tangible gift at all, I would have donated the entire price of the real designer bag to a charity that helps kids in 3rd world countries, maybe one that provides meals for kids in orphanages. And then given her a certificate of some sort: \u201c$xxxx has been donated in your name to xxxx charity.\u201d There are plenty like that, both religious and not, and maybe she would have seen how selfish she was being, demanding a bag of that price when there are kids who don\u2019t even get meals every day.", "ESH For buying her a prank gift that taught her nothing, for your parents and her parents for teaching her to be entitled and ungrateful. When she made the remark about you only getting her \"cheap\" gifts you should have told her she wouldn't be getting anything from here on out since she is behaving ungrateful and spoiled. If you really felt like you had to get her something then donate to a charity in her name.", "ESH. She sounds like Carmelita Spats, but saying \"it's not the price that matters, it's the thought\" is sorta of invalidated when you're deliberately getting her something she'll dislike. \n\nYou could have called out the behavior when it was brought up and been up front about *not* getting her the item, and use that as a great time to call out selfish behavior.\n\nInstead, you played games. I don't think it was your conscious INTENT to play games, but you went about it in a slightly passive aggressive way that doesn't really teach the lesson you want it to. I don't think you're the asshole in the sense that you *let down* your niece, as you would have by saying you wouldn't get it either - but I do think YTA for how you handled it. So, ESH.", "ESH. \n\nYou don't have to get her an expensive gift if you don't want to. But it's not your job to punish your niece for her character flaws. (Or for existing, given that you make a point of being childfree and seem jealous of the attention she gets.) Adults should not be in the business of \"humbling\" kids - if you find her annoying to be around, just avoid her. \n\nYou and your niece sound like perfect matches for each other, to be honest.", "ESH. Why didn't you buy her a replica.  A well made one ? That she'd be walking around for a long time thinking it was the original one. By giving her a bad fake one she figured it out in a sec and you just looked like an AH for everyone.", "Why tf didn't you get her a nice dupe to show her that she could still have a nice bag that isn't $2k? Or give nothing at all because you can't be demanded to buy stuff for other people.  ESH, but you more so because you're an adult. It's good you're child free because that is spiteful childhood behavior.", "ESH, but this child and her parents are a bit more TA than you. If I ever reacted that way to receiving a gift, my parents would have been seething. Those parents need to teach her to be a little more grateful for what she receives from others.

Totally cringeworthy.", "NTA and stop buying her gifts altogether until she learns how to be less selfish", "YTA\n\nUnpopular. \n\nIt wasn't your place to humble her. She is 15, and a minor. It was really immature to spend money on a fake bag just to prove a point that wasn't yours to make.", "ESH why are so many people posting here treating kids like adults and retaliating as if they were?

You dotn owe your niece anything just because you can afford it. A 2k bag for a kid is outrageous. Her parents are doing a sh*t job raising her. I wonder where that entitlement came from in your niece as it doesn't seem you are like that or your parents? Is broehr jsut an absolute doormat and SIL was raised entitled?", "NTA\n\nSo this 15 year old knows the price is $2200 and expects it? I don't agree that aunts and uncles should be getting better presents than the parents. It's just a birthday, something around $50 should be more than enough.

Though perhaps its just a proxy for your sister, which kind of makes it worse.\n\nYou also don't have to apologize for not buying the handbag.  I wonder if you heard the concerns there wrong, and rather than disappointing the ask is that you apologize for the surprisingly immature prank.  You don't seem to enjoy these people though so why bother showing up.  Especially since if you are unwilling to be mature in your relationship with this teen in a direct way, you're not even bothering to utilize the minimum influence you might have if your relationship is deeper than what's portrayed here.\n\nYour niece learned nothing and is now probably being reinforced by her parents coddling.  Possibly you and your sibling and digging in your heels over childhood resentments and tweaking each other.  Your parents seem more interested in just keeping the superficial peace rather than helping your niece understand words have impact and reminding her mother of that too.\n\nBut you win i guess!  You were able to make your niece cry!  You sure put her in her place for that little portion of victory and so sweet it was in public too.  And you got to make a public statement at the party so that you could be absolutely sure that everyone knew your intent to publicly surprise shame your niece rather than have a real conversation!  You sound like you feel pretty good about it and had fun with it.  I'm sure it improved family relationships all around.  Hopefully the anticipation you enjoyed makes up for that.", "ESH.

She's an only child and also the first and only grandchild to my parents. Ever since she was younger my brother, SIL and parents gave her every and anything she wanted, never said no to her, you get the gist. \n\nDue to this now at 15 she is NIGHTMARE to deal with. Everyone just basically gives her whatever she wants because you know, \"she's the baby\".\n\nMy husband (42M) and I are child free by choice. We both have good careers and do very well for ourselves. I've always had an expensive taste when it came to clothing, jewelry, bags etc. (Important for later).\n\nA few weeks ago my husband and I went over to my parents house for a family lunch. My brother, SIL and niece were there too. The conversations were mainly catered around my niece because her birthday was approaching. My parents asked her what she wanted for her birthday this year?\n\nShe told them that she wanted this specific designer bag worth around $2,200 usd. My parents were completely taken aback and kind of started laughing telling my niece that's a bit excessive and there's no way they're spending that kind of money on a bag.\n\nMy niece then turned to my husband and I and said \"well you guys can get it for me then, you're rich but yet you always get me cheap gifts\". My husband and I were both taken aback (the gifts we get her aren't \"cheap\" at all) at how ungrateful and rude she was acting. And also the sheer audacity of a 15 year old demanding I get her a thousand dollar bag.\n\nMy SIL jumped in the conversation saying how I have all these bags, and \"flaunting\" then around my niece is only going to make her want them. So pretty much saying, I made my bed lie in it and get her the bag.\n\nI think they left the conversation think they guilt tripped me into getting her the bag, well they were wrong. I hopped on one of those designer dupe wholesale websites, ordered the bag for like $60 usd. The bag came in like 2 weeks later, I wrapped the gift and brought it to my niece's birthday party.\n\nFast forward she saw mine and my husband gift and got super excited, she opened her gift  and immediately her face dropped. She turned red in the face (you could tell the bag was a dupe). She asked us \"what is this, is this a joke?\" I said \"no, this is your gift. Maybe in the future you should be grateful for the gifts we get you. It's not the price that matter, it's the thought\".\n\nMy niece started crying calling us \"cheap\" and \"embarrassing\", my SIL had some not so nice words either. My brother, SIL and parents are upset because I \"let down\" my niece, and think I should apologize. I think she needed to be humbled, and that her parents should encourage her to apologize for my husband and I for demanding us to buy her the bag in the first place.
