Yikes...", "NTA - you married a really selfish possessive guy.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a control tactic, please do not fall for it.

He doesn't want to go. If this were him, he'd go on a boys trip and not look back. He literally just wants you to miss out and be as miserable as him, and that is not acceptable. A decent father and husband would be happy that his wife and child were going to enjoy something that they want, not be jealous of it.\n\nHe's manipulating you in the hopes that it will ruin your trip or you won't go.

Our daughter has also never been on a plane or to Disney.\n\nMy husband had previously expressed to my mother that he does not like Disney, he told me he would not be able to get off work, he told me we could not afford it, he said he would not enjoy being there with my sister and mom and would just be a crab ass anyways.\n\nWhen they first invited me and I happily accepted, he and I got into a huge fight.  My mom eventually offered to pay for him and add him to the trip, or even to buy a plane ticket for a day, so he could come one day and see our daughter at Disney. He declined the invite for the same aforementioned reasons. \n\nBut yet, he's still upset. I cant bring it up without him blowing up.  I get that he's jealous, but if the shoe was on the other foot and his dad had planned a \"guys\" trip with the kids, I would be supportive. \n\nThe trip is next week and I'm feeling very guilty because I was getting excited/planning outfits, packing, and whatnot. He asked me to not even talk about it so he can pretend it's not happening. \n\nI feel like I should just cancel and not go.\n\nAITA for accepting the invite to a trip without him? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
