And one where a step sibling/sibling crashed the car of their minor siblings and the younger one was basically told to get over it when she wanted to go to the police and report it cause her insurance would only hel if it had been reported stolen meaning possible jail time for sibling and the parents weren\u2019t willing to fix it.", "The car is in the grandfather's name, and he approves what they did.", "Why not? She did nothing wrong in this situation. Punishing the child just seems like a power play because your authority feels threatened.", "Great way to lose custody of daughter to grandparents.", "He's the brother they're referring to", "It\u2019s not favoritism that he gifted the car to his own relative and didn\u2019t got one for a stranger who\u2019s coincidentally is the son of the partner of the son. Yeah this is something unfair in every patchwork family, but farther relatives aren\u2019t obligated to see stepgrandkids the same as actual grandkids. They can\u2019t leave them out entirely, but they aren\u2019t obligated to have the same relationship to those kids either. Bet the daughter won\u2019t get as nice present as her Step-Brother from his grandparents either.", "Truck nutz only exist to offend with passive-aggression.\n\nShow me where pink is meant to offend if the person with the pink thing LIKES pink.", "Paint job for a car if your doing it yourself which it sounds like this family can easily do is rather cheap the paint isn\u2019t really that expensive.  What you pay for in painting a car is the labor, which in this case was free.", "This sub is rediculous.", "I'd hate pink, but love a beetle! (purple would be okay).", "So what would have been the proper course of action for grandfather? Just a reminder, this was not a brand new car, it was a vehicle that has been in the family for many years and was passed down to OP's niece.\n\nFavoring one grandchild over the other is problematic only in context-less social vacuum. Grandfather wanted to give that car, the one that has been in the family for quite a while, to his granddaughter. Did he have to also buy, pull out of his magical closet or otherwise conjure a car for his step-grandson? Just so it is fair? Is he not allowed to gift something of his to one of his grandkids if he possesses only one of it and therefore cannot give a similar thing to that kid's sibling?\n\nTo add to this, what is the nature of relationship between the grandfather and grandchildren? What if one of them visits every week and shows affection, while the other barely acknowledges the man's existence? These things we don't know, but outside the context-less social vacuum they will factor in decision.\n\nFor clarification, we do not live in a context-less social vacuum. \n\nOP is NTA, and grandfather is NTA as well.", "A sick I\u2019ve but my thug is I don\u2019t think you should try to force people to have the relationship with your two children that you want. He got married and has a step child but that doesn\u2019t mean that the grandparents have the same relationship with the young man that they have other their granddaughter. Also I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to think that you can keep things completely even with all the children. You just don\u2019t always get the exact same thing as your siblings all the time.", "Step nephew hasn't said anything, his father feels that his siblings treated his step son completely differently and HE has a problem with it. Why are you telling the step nephew to grow up? \n\nSecondly let's not pretend any different, a guy driving around in a pink car is going to feel silly and also likely to be laughed at. The Op and siblings intentionally made it pink to make the car more the daughters because they were clearly upset the brother forced the car to be shared. They also believe making it pink makes it more hers and that the step son won't drive it.\n\nI have a friend who rented a car, we were driving around in a convertible that was yellow and had morons stop and laugh at us for being gay... because people can literally be that fucking stupid. A car more often driven by women and in a 'girly' colour made people assume we were gay, but sure, the step son will have zero issues in the real world driving around in a pink car.", ">Truck nutz only exist to offend \n\nSource please?", "It\u2019s always weird seeing people so obsessed with their own authority. Why would the daughter get punished? It was a surprise and she did nothing wrong. Furthermore, the car was given to her by her grandfather. That makes it her car, not her parents\u2019 property. Her dad can be angry all he wants, but punishing her is nonsensical and would simply be a way to assuage his hurt pride.", "Really? I got the opposite impression. It may be that stepson gets some preferential treatment from OP\u2019s brother as a balance to all of the favor OP\u2019s niece receives from his side of the family, but more likely I think OP\u2019s brother is just trying to keep the peace in his home. Again, sucks all around.", "Because the elder comes from a place of power, and how they treat their progeny affects how the family treats them. \n\nIf grandpa excludes grand kid a, then every one else takes their social quest on how to treat kid a.", "The last paragraph says Dad is now buying stepson a car, which he should've just done in the first place", "[removed]", "My mother's mother died when she was a small child and she gained a stepmother around age 10-11. My mother always considered her to be her mother and she was only ever Grandma to me. There was never any feeling of different treatment among the grandchildren of Grandpa's first children and those he had with her.", "I've only ever seen it once IRL but I was immediately in love. You should definitely do it.", "Do it!", "No, I never said the color pink was offensive. I just think the customization was done to drive off the step sibling. If the niece had bought the car herself, I would have a completely different opinion.", "Your step-sister. Depending on the history, the two might not even see each other as siblings. It's absolutely entitled to think you would be owed something by family you don't really belong to.", "No one mentioned the step son though, this is the parent of both children who felt like the gift was sending a message, it's the brother of OP who asked them to share and the brother of OP who was upset about the colour change. It doesn't matter if the siblings see each other as siblings and no one has mentioned the step son expecting or being entitled at all. It's OPs brother who clearly feels his children are being treated differently."]}
