The step-nephew just doesn't want to drive a pink car. Sucks to suck.", "So he can walk or get the bus instead if he's too insecure to drive a FREE pink car.", "I think we found the step brother or the dad. \ud83e\udd23", "It\u2019s.not.his.car! \nWhat part of that don\u2019t you understand? He has NO say in anything done to the car because he is borrowing it sometimes and that\u2019s it. If he wants his own car he can buy it or have his grandparents buy it.", "You raise a good point. I had my dad's Toyota Camry until I had enough money to buy my own vehicle. I didn't like it, it was too small but I had to make do or walk. \n\nHowever, one more counterpoint: Why didn't the Grandfather just simply work with the step-kid and help out pick his own vehicle? The Grandfather is a major car nerd. He could've helped out a little bit. This whole scenario just smells... favoritism in a weird way. Because the two of em shares the fucking car. I just think I would've gave the elder son a little heads up.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I thought I understood that the idea of fairness would be towards the fact that both kids should have some form of input. But they don't in reality if one of the kids is mooching off of the other kid. \n\nSo my way is dumb got it. Cool.", "Exactly! It wasn\u2019t given to him. She\u2019s being nice and letting him use it. So he can either deal with pink for the privilege of having access to a car, or he can ask to borrow someone else\u2019s car. Why don\u2019t his Mum or stepdad share their cars? It\u2019s not up to her father who drives HER car.", "It's about the intent of the gift. The person giving intends the gift for one person, and permitted the vehicle be modified to suit that person. What the father wanted for the vehicle is irrelevant to the gifter. What the person the father has decreed will share the gift wants is also irrelevant to the gifter, and quite appropriately so.", "That's good advice. His parents should take it. Seeing as none of them bought him one.", "Get this clear: the father is requiring that the gift to one child be shared with the other child. \n\nThere's inherent unfairness in that bullshit.", "Okay, I guess my way is dumb.", "Okay."]}
