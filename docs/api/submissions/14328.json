I had my dad's Toyota Camry until I had enough money to buy my own vehicle. I didn't like it, it was too small but I had to make do or walk. \n\nHowever, one more counterpoint: Why didn't the Grandfather just simply work with the step-kid and help out pick his own vehicle? The Grandfather is a major car nerd. He could've helped out a little bit. This whole scenario just smells... favoritism in a weird way. Because the two of em shares the fucking car.

The brother, however, is a very large AH for making her share a gift that was given TO HER with the stepbrother.\n\nThat being said, since it's still in your father's name, has he put her on his insurance? That is CRITICAL. I knew someone whose daughter started driving one of their cars, they did not tell the insurance company she was doing it, and she had an accident.

He should have bought his stepson a car in the first place instead of forcing his daughter to share her gift that was meant for her alone.

I don't think I've ever owned a car over 3k and I'm 33. You don't need a nice car. It's a gift.

It didn't occur to me for even a moment that these people I couldn't really care if they existed or not got me a house. I had 4 grandparents, I had 2 parents. I got what they gave me. \n\nThere are so many factors. Like did the grandkids help raise both since babies? Or did they just get a kid into the family the last 4 years and people actually expect them to care this much? \n\nPersonally anyone that didn't raise me or me help raise them is family adjacent at best. I struggle forming connections with people I spend zero time with and haven't known long versus significant people in my life.

I can't think anyone objectively cares as much about step parents families as easily as their own withour significant time it's so alien to me as a base concept. \n\nHalf the threads on aita are shitty step parents trying to force a family on others as they fucked someone and want it to be perfect.
