I've been doing my best to support her through her treatment, like driving her to the hospital, helping her find accommodation, even waking up at 4 am to pick her up from the airport after visiting her family. I've provided a shoulder to lean on, accompanied her to hospital visits, and never asked for anything in return. My intention has always been to offer genuine support during this challenging time. I've never kept track of the things I've done for her, and I've never expected anything in return.\n\nRecently, things took an unexpected turn, and I'm questioning whether I was in the wrong. After spending a day helping her move into a new place near the hospital, she asked me to grab some groceries for her that evening (which she will pay me back for), including a specific instant meal from a particular supermarket. While discussing it, she suggested I try the meal as well and I said sure and I got two portions.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, there came a time when I was calculating the receipts for the total she owed me for the groceries. Whilst I was doing that, she said to me to remember to take off my portion of the meal from the grand total. In that moment, I felt a bit disheartened when she insisted that I should pay for my own meal. I expressed disappointment and said why can't she treat me for this once and that I've supported her during this difficult time. I haven't kept track of anything because it's not about the expenses it's more about the reciprocity, feeling recognized, appreciated, and, in a way, looking after each other. She argued for a bit before agreeing to cover it, with her main reason being that she's not working right now and has a limited budget.\n\nSince that incident, the atmosphere between us has been a bit strange. I want to emphasize that it's not about the money \u2013 I understand her financial situation and have never asked for a penny back for my efforts, she would have paid hundred in taxi fares if it wasn\u2019t for me. It felt to me like as if my help has gone unappreciated and the friendship is extremely one-sided.\n\nI still want to be there for her, but I can't shake off the feeling that maybe I mishandled the situation. So AITA for bringing up reciprocity and implying shat she should cover for my dinner, which was only around $5, given the circumstances? I'm torn, and I could use some outside perspectives.", "created_utc": 1700750326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1822kdb/aita_for_bringing_up_reciprocity_in_supporting_my/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I told her she should have covered for my meal. \n\nI'm questioning whether this might make me the asshole as it could be perceived as insensitive or placing undue emphasis on the financial aspect, given her current health and financial situation.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Covering your $5 dinner is something she should have just done given all the help you've provided. A little bit of reciprocation should be expected in a friendship and goes a long way. It's not like you're asking for a big grand gesture or anything. Her covering that meal is really a bare minimum level of expectation.", "NTA. She isn't valuing your time at all. \n\nAlthough it's very sad what she's going through, it sounds like she is using this supposed friendship to her advantage. Otherwise she wouldn't have pointedly asked for you to cover the food that she suggested you try when you were doing all her food shopping.\n\nYou said you've only been friends for 6 months. Does she have other friends and family near by? You'd think there are people who have been in her life longer who could lend a hand. You shouldn't be expected to endlessly sacrifice for someone you've known for less than a year, or anyone for that matter. \n\nIt's easy to act like \"It's not about the money\" when you're the one benefitting from it. She is disregarding how much money you've spent on her, and fixating on the one time it went the other way. That's a clear sign of a user. You need to set boundaries and limitations here. Tell her what you will and will not do, what you need reimbursement for, and stick to your guns.", "NTA \n\nBut it\u2019s not about the $5 meal. What do *you* get out of this friendship? Answer that question truthfully and honestly. Are you doing all this stuff just out of a sense of obligation to her, or because she gives you something intangible in return?", "NTA. \n\nThis was a tiny thing she could have done out of appreciation. Obviously, she\u2019s dealing with a lot but somewhere in all that there is room for appreciation and acknowledgement. Hopefully, upon reflection, she\u2019ll be more appreciative moving forward.\n\nAs for you, you made your point. Give her space to process and do better. If she wants to be weird about it that\u2019s on her.", "NTA at all!\n\nYou sound like an angel doing all this for someone you only just met and it's a shame that she can't seem to see that.\n\nI think you should scale back your help and support of her. She's not deserving of all the time, energy and money you've put into her.\n\nThis is crazy to me on all levels. Cancel and help and all that aside, even if I had gone grocery shopping, if I recommend my friend to try something, I'm going to get it for them.", "NTA\n\nI want to say give her a pass because of what she\u2019s been going through, but pointedly demanding you deduct the cost is super petty.", "NTA.  Maybe it wasn't worth saying because it is just 5$ but I hear you.  I am a bit confused about timeline.  If you met right before she was diagnosed so it was a brand new friendship, so basically your whole relationship has been you being her support person?  Is this right? Doesn't she have any long time friends that she has had for many years?  Why are you the person doing all this stuff?  It is a bit too much. The role you are taking on is the role of a longtime friend or a best friend.  Not the role of someone she just met.  Yes, her mentioning to make sure you deducted your $5 dinner means that she does not want to reciprocate.  It does sound like you are being used.", "NTA As someone who has gone through cancer treatments twice now I know how anxiety ridden it can be.  Your friend may be experiencing this when it comes to her expenses and health etc and in the moment got caught up in that feeling over the $5 expense.  I am hoping that is the case and your friend will realize their error after they have some time do decompress.", "NTA. I think your expectation was more than reasonable.", "NTA we all want to know our kindness is valued . You were her support system and even when I understand money is tight for her right now it would have still be a nice gesture to show gratitude . We like to help others but after a while they take it for granted .", "NTA You've been an incredible friend to her during a difficult period, so it's fair to ask for a little reciprocity, particularly for a small expense like dinner.", "NTA.  If it was me I probably wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it (I do hate any sort of \u201cconfrontation\u201d though) but it would certainly have made me question the friendship at that point.  It\u2019s disappointing when you find yourself being taken for granted and it may be time to start withdrawing from relationship if it\u2019s just based on you doing things for her with no apparent appreciation for your efforts.", "NTA - it was the least she could do after all you have done for her. She can call an Uber next time.", "NTA maybe not be so available in the future?  I get her situation is hard for her but showing appreciation for being helped is just entitled of her.  She is not entitled and you are not obligated.  Good luck", "NTA. Realize that you aren't her friend but her staff, her Uber, her Uber eats. Does she pay for your gas? Does she do anything to show her appreciation?\n\nI've been where your \"friend\" has been except I was still working. There is no excuse for being inconsiderate.", "I can imagine things are very hard for your friend and maybe she doesn't have bandwidth for this right now. At the same time, you've only know her for 6 months. Where are her other friends? Is it possible she doesn't have other friends because she has a history of using people up? Also, is she reimbursing you for the gas you've spent driving her to and from the airport, hospital appointments, grocery, etc? If not, then I think it's very stingy of her to NOT repay you for gas you wouldn't otherwise have spent (not to mention your time: if she'd had to get Uber or taxis, she'd have spent FAR more), but makes sure she charges you back for a $5 meal. Yes, maybe the $5 is hard for her, but I think her being unwilling to spend even such a small amount to reciprocate suggests a view of you as being her servant rather than her friend.", "NTA, it\u2019s clear that you were feeling the lack of reciprocity in the relationship and it was probably was simmering under the surface.  It\u2019s exhausting to give all of yourself to someone and not feel cared for in a relationship.  All it may take is some nice words of concern about what is going on in your life, a statement of \u201cI\u2019m here for you too\u201d.  So unfortunately that feeling came out in this instance.  I\u2019m sure she is on limited budget and I don\u2019t think this would have been an issue if you felt this friendship wasn\u2019t a one way street", "NTA. You\u2019ve done a lot for your friend without expecting anything in return. The least she could have done is buy you a cheap meal. I think she might be taking advantage of your generosity", "NTA Asking you to pay for your $5 meal was disingenuous. You've bent over backwards to help your friend in her time of need. She suggested you get the meal while you were doing HER groceries and join you for dinner. If she intended for you to buy your own meal she should have said so in the first place.", "NTA Given that you've been offering such sincere support during a trying time, it makes perfect sense that you would want some recognition and reciprocity in a friendship.", "NTA. She is using you. She will regret not having your services anymore over the sake of one meal. \n\nI know you probably feel a lot of sympathy for her but please do not let yourself be taken advantage of like this- you matter too.", "My therapist had a good way of illustrating to me why I often feel like my relationships end up one sided - in a funny coincidence to this story, she compared it to a rainy day jar or a social bank account. \n\nIn this metaphor she said that the emphasis was not to compare pennies to pennies of effort, but to see who was making more deposits and who is making more withdrawals over time. In this scenario, making deposits is equivalent to doing something for the friendship, a kindness we can expect from a friend, and making withdrawals is leaning on the friendship by asking for support or it could also be asking for your understanding when they've done something to upset you, using their social capital to smooth things over.\n\nIf you're making more deposits into the friendship, but they are making more withdrawals, evaluate that - not a one to one, but a trend over time. If they are making deposits and withdrawals, and you're making deposits, but when you ask to make withdrawals, they are hesitant or unsupportive or unwilling, there is something to that - they see you as an additive source for them to keep them in the black and balanced, but are unwilling to help when you're in the red \n\nAs a people-pleaser, this made me hesitant because it makes friendships seem transactional, but she said to look at it more as stock than transaction for transaction, is your relationship balance growing over time, is it staying the same, and is that because of equal withdrawals and deposits on both sides, or is it because one person's making deposits and one person's only making withdrawals and so it's pretty stagnant. \n\nYou can do nice things for no reason, and it seems like you have, but it's also okay to take stock and realize that you are feeding a garden that someone else is plundering without helping (a garden works really well for this metaphor if a rainy day jar seems too transactional or you're like me and love plants) - who is tending the garden, and if you're putting in all of the labor and someone else's only reaping all of the fruit without helping the labor, it's okay to acknowledge that and want some of the fruit for yourself, or want to sometimes rely on their help without having to beg for it. If you're not going to get that from this garden, you may have to search for a new garden - or a supplementary garden because you realize that right now you can't get what you need from this garden to sustain yourself, but maybe you could down the line.\n\n\nEdit: with this in mind, NTA, It's okay to bring up that you feel like the balance isn't in the middle, and even if she doesn't have money right now, she could show appreciation in other ways, but it doesn't seem like she is at the moment, or even meaningfully acknowledging how much driving her or grocery shopping for her is really meaningful time that you're spending for her. Obviously she's going through a lot so maybe she can't financially always be square, but she could be making it up to you in other ways, her friendship, her support, her listening, but you wouldn't feel this way if you felt like she was being a five-star friend in other ways. Obviously we can't be on all the time, and cancer takes out a lot of us, but friendship is about making each other better and you should also be able to bring something up like that without feeling like you'll be met with weirdness. It's also unfortunate that this has happened so early on in your friendship, you didn't have time to build up that social capital to feel like she's done so much for you so now you can do so much for her without pouring your cup empty. Hopefully if your friendship lasts, she can repay your friendship emotionally and supportively in the future.", "NTA\n\nIf you did for me what you did for her I\u2019d be bending over backwards to try to make up for it. That she not only didn\u2019t offer you the meal, but actually went through the trouble of reminding you to take it off the final number, is a kick in the gut. The only outcome is that, of course, you feel unappreciated and unvalued.", "NAH, honestly. I understand why you felt how you felt, and probably would have felt the same. She is probably in survival mode right now though, don't have a lot of money and tons of medical bills, so maybe she is just not seeing this from your perspective. But you were right to speak up instead of letting this rot. I am not sure it's really the best time to have another \"what about reciprocity\" talk though. Maybe wait till she is out of the woods. Then she'll be able to breathe and take a look around, realize how much she owes you (and i don't mean money).", "Don\u2019t let $5 prevent you from helping someone n need.", ">She argued for a bit before agreeing to cover it, with her main reason being that she's not working right now and has a limited budget.\n\nYTA. Not for bringing it up, it's a fair and honest convern. But given her reasons, I think you should have conceded on this one immediately because the conflict was over money.\n\n>I want to emphasize that it's not about the money\n\nThat's not what came out. This is what came out: \"why can't she treat me for this once and that I've supported her during this difficult time.\" You used a social relationship to ask for something about money. That's icky to a lot of people, and someone with a limited budget is probably going to have a shorter tolerance for it. So I think you should have let it go, and let the seed germinate in your friend's mind that she should do a good turn for you, *LATER*. On her own initiative.", "NTA! They should have got your meal. Absolutely! And probably a lot more.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s important to remember when you do charitable acts that they are selfless. You shouldn\u2019t do them to ever expect anything. You should do them because you love the person, believe they are suffering and need help, etc. Not working and having an illness can mean you\u2019re managing your every penny. \n\nKindness is its own reward as the saying goes. \n\nWhen you said \u201c..feeling recognized, appreciated, and, in a way, looking after each other\u201d it sounds like you\u2019re missing that feeling in other aspects of your life. I don\u2019t want to judge, you\u2019ve done many wonderful things. What I\u2019m suggesting is you reflect inward as you WHY you really did all this stuff. Is it because you love this person or are there elements of you doing it to fill a void in your life. People pleasers often think they should be treated the way they treat others but many people don\u2019t share the same values and it can place you in situations where you\u2019re taken advantage of. People pleasers are often are taken advantage of. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re very kind and extremely generous with your time and efforts. I hope you find relationships that make you feel as recognized and appreciated as you make others feel.", "I\u2019m going to get downvoted to hell about this but here I go. Yes, YTA. Five bucks may not be much for you but to someone going through cancer and not working, $5 can be a big deal. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been a good friend and have gone above and beyond to be supportive. If your friend isn\u2019t showing gratitude then let me say: thank you. Cancer is a lonely battle and a strong social system is so important to getting through the diagnosis. A person going through cancer may not be at their best - they are scared literally for their life. Her lack of appreciation may not be her natural state because her battle is causing her to retreat in and become more focused on herself. \n\nYou may need to decide if this friendship is right for you, or choose to do less for/with your friend. Caretaker burnout is a real thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
