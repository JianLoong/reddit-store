Ann few days after she found out the gender in Dec, Ann made a post about names she was considering, one of them was my little angel girls name. Tears came to my eyes seeing the shape of my little girls name. I was so confused why my cousin would even think of using it. \nI messaged Ann her know that would make me really uncomfortable. Ann was super understanding and said she was only considering it bc her \u201cgranny suggested it as a way to honor her mom and its a family name\u201d which did not surprise me.

I told her how I felt & asked her to please stop pushing the name on Ann and she just gaslit me and said I was \u201cdisrespecting my elders\u201d \nA day or so after the family event,  I made a Tiktok video about it. I did not use their names. It got under 800 views. \nMy aunt Gloria found the video a few days ago. Gloria made facebook post \u201cwarning me\u201d to never post about her again. \nThere was no name calling but I was a condescending bi*** in my comments on her post.

Yes, it's true that no one owns a name, but in this situation, I think a little compassion on their part would have been appropriate. There are so many beautiful names out there; they could have easily compiled a list without the one name that belonged to your daughter. Your little girl mattered, OP, and I am so sorry for your loss.", "Sorry to be harsh op, but *you* are the one who feels entitled to your grandmother\u2019s name. Also, because it\u2019s your grandmother\u2019s name that means *it\u2019s a family name*.  This is not about hurting you, it\u2019s about them honoring your grandmother\u2019s memory. YTA.", "YTA. I understand this entire thing is very painful to you. The loss of a child is unbearable. That said you don't own this name. Your family should understand this is hurtful but they don't care for whatever reason. \n\nAt this point you need to stop engaging these people and let things simmer down. They may or may not name their child this name.", "Sorry but YTA my daughter is named after my granny\u2019s granny\u2026 so is my cousin, so is my great uncle \u2026 no one owns a name", "I am very sorry for your loss. I can\u2019t imagine losing a baby, and I don\u2019t know how I would ever get over it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be hard but I do think that your cousin can name her daughter after her grandmother. They are very insensitive how they approached it I think, she could have talked to you about it and they should not dismiss your feelings or your loss. But I think for you to make a video and post it online and to feel like you own a name that is a family name because your grandmother also had that name does make you in the wrong. I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole though.", "Our son (19) died in November. Obviously, we are all devastated. OP, you are right - you are not meant to live without your kids. There is nothing in nature that prepares us to survive that loss. I know I am forever changed, as are you. \n\nOur middle son (18) informed us a few months ago that his gf is pregnant. He plans to name his child after his brother (as a middle name). He wanted to do a first name, but he knew that would be too hard for me. \n\nI know the difference is that he's using the name to honor my deceased child (his brother), and your cousin was only considering it for the same reason you did - bc of the grandmother. \n\nBecause I understand how hard it would be to hear the name all the time, I'm going to say softly, ESH.  Only bc I also know that if my son had chosen to use his brother's name as a first name for his child, I would just have to find a way to deal with it. And as hard as it is, you would have to also if this cousin (or a future family member) chooses to use the grandmother's name. \n I am fortunate that my son considered my feelings in using the name where your family did not. Your aunt sucks for not even attempting to pretend to understand your feelings. \n\nIt seems your cousin understood the difficulty you would face, and I am glad she ended up picking something else. Perhaps try working on name exposure in therapy in case a future relative chooses to honor the grandmother with the name. That way you can hear the name without crumbling. \n\nSo sorry for your loss. I wish you peace and healing.", "People don\u2019t own names, even when it\u2019s sad.\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\nStop seeing these people. \nYou made the TikTok, you can\u2019t control the responses.\n\nI have 8 first cousins with the exact same first name as me. It\u2019s our grandma\u2019s name.", "YTA in my opinion. \nYou don't own the name and are not entitled to it forever. What happened with your baby is ofc devastating. But that does not mean this name should be vetoed for the rest of your family forever. \nIt's great that she chose a different name but someone might still use it, so you should prepare yourself for that.", "NTA. I have a feeling that if your cousin came to you to respectfully discuss the name that it wouldn\u2019t have been as painful. Having the name added to a list of names as if it was just an option that didn\u2019t carry some sort of weight was wrong and dismissive of what you have gone through.\n\nI have a child who has the same name as a cousins ex-boyfriend that she had dated for years. I knew something bad had happened between them but didn\u2019t know the extent. I didn\u2019t even throw that name around without mentioning it to her first to be sure there wasn\u2019t any pain or trauma associated with that name. Family shouldn\u2019t want to cause each other pain and should address sensitive subjects with love and understanding.  I\u2019m sorry that wasn\u2019t done for you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and thankful your cousin went with another name.", "ESH.  In spite of what you think, your grandmother\u2019s name is a family name.  Anyone has the right to use it.  If your cousin wants to use it to honor her great grandmother that is perfectly fair.  That\u2019s not to say that I can\u2019t bother you or being up the feelings surrounding losing your daughter who was named after grandma/great grandma too.  Your aunt definitely suck because she\u2019s being obnoxious.  If she had just nicely pointed out that Audrey was her granddaughter\u2019s grandmother too, it would have been fine.

Now, it's ESH instead of YTA, because it appears you did ask them not to choose that name and their reaction was to choose it anyway, but since it's your grandmother's name, that's well within their right to use for the same reasons. Your gatekeeping of the name sucks, but your aunt's possessiveness of the name in spite of you also sucks.", "NTA. Your aunt is a d-bag though, and I feel bad for your cousin. (And you, of course, you\u2019ve experienced something that no parent should ever have to endure.) But it sounds as though your aunt was pushing this name on your cousin\u2019s child, even after she didn\u2019t want it. If your cousin had actually been keen on the name, or expressed interest in it on her own, I would be hurt- but also understanding, as it\u2019s what your grandmother went by, or a modified version of that. I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019d push for \u201cAudrey\u201d and not \u201cAudra\u201d if that was her mother\u2019s name though, it sounds like she\u2019s just trying to hurt you by doing that. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for the loss of your daughter, my heart goes out to you truly. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, maybe a little petty for the TikTok, but it\u2019s not like any of it was wrong, or made up, or a lie. Your aunt basically did the same exact thing on Facebook, but she doesn\u2019t see that she was actually wrong for any of this. It\u2019s so strange that she kept pushing for it, even after Ann said she was using another name, like why are you still bringing this up?!\n\nI don\u2019t understand people saying Y T A here, like yes of course you\u2019re not \u201centitled\u201d to the name, but I think you know that. Hell, I named my daughter after my partner\u2019s grandmother who is very much still alive and well. We asked her if it would be okay with her first, and she loved the idea so that\u2019s what we went with. It wasn\u2019t exactly a \u201cfamily name\u201d until now, she\u2019s the only one with the name, aside from our daughter. BUT we\u2019re the first of her grandkids to have a girl, I wouldn\u2019t be at all shocked if there\u2019s another baby girl in his family that gets named the same thing in the coming years, and I don\u2019t mind that. It\u2019s a lot different for you, you unfortunately lost your daughter, and clearly your family is aware. It was really insensitive of your aunt to suggest it in the first place, knowing what she knows. That really changes things, and I think had they asked you instead of you just seeing it on Facebook, it would be a different situation. I\u2019m sure that was just shocking to see and I can\u2019t imagine. Good luck with your terrible aunt, OP. (And I\u2019m glad your cousin chose a different name for her baby.

It\u2019s not the norm for Aunt\u2019s who aren\u2019t close to visit in the hospital when a baby is born, and very much not the norm when the baby is critically ill - random Aunt Gloria is doomed if she stays away, and doomed if she visits and annoys you in those precious few days.

But she kept pushing, ignoring my feelings and telling me was my \u201celder\u201d \nLiterally that was her only response!! \u201cIm your elder!!\u201d Like huh??? \nAnd months later finally seeing my totally anonymous tiktok and make a post instead of talking to me about it??? \nThey are all cut off now.", "It IS a family name. It\u2019s the aunt\u2019s mother/cousin\u2019s great-grandmother.", "THIS ! Is the problem. The name IS being used. My daughter being dead doesnt mean she disappeared and we all forgot. She was a person, she mattered and she still does. She was and is still part of mine and my families life every day. Even if she isnt here.", " \u201cNot even actively being used?\u201d What an awful thing to say.", "YTA", "Fixed (:", "I need to go back through and edit it. I didn\u2019t realize that stuff is hard for some people to read.", "That's what I'm thinking, why would you want your own daughter compared to her dead cousin. Awful situation and really feel for OP", "I'm not saying I don't understand that bit but the association with a child that is already deceased is the line for me. How little respect you must have for your own family's grief to push that button. It can't be used as a middle name or hyphenated? I've seen almost this exact same scenario on AITA and it got voted the other way...", "Thank you, I\u2019m so tired of everything being gaslighting, when it doesn\u2019t fit the definition. Gaslighting it feels is losing its meaning, it just means lying at this point", "Her aunt's mom and her cousins grandma also died. Gloria and Ann seem like they have shitty personalities, but they have every right to use the name.", "Aunts mom also died!", "But it's also Ann's grabdmothers name.", "my brother and my cousin have the same name, named after no one. just happened that both my mother and aunt chose the same name without knowing, and when they knew both said they didn't want to change so we just call them by their full name when they're together. At first it seems unusual, but then you get used to it", "I have the same first name as my cousin, it\u2019s really no big deal. My parents didn\u2019t share the middle name and neither did my cousin\u2019s parents, but they both picked a top 20 name\u2026 so by coincidence we have the same first and middle name, and only found out by talking about our names when we were 10. We thought it was pretty funny. \n\nThere\u2019s also a tradition in my family of giving the eldest son this particular name, they go by their middle names. Some all the time, some only for family events. That one is pretty lame but it still doesn\u2019t hinder everyday life. \n\nWRT op though, I think all this depends on how close she is with those cousins and how often they see each other. With some of mine they live clear across the country or on the other side of the world. It wouldn\u2019t make any difference to me on a daily basis what they call their kids.", "I share an exact same first name with 8 first cousins, our grandmother\u2019s name.", "I think they\u2019re second cousins. If this was OP\u2019s sibling\u2019s kid it would be off\u2014but I have lots of cousins and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use a name because someone I saw a few times a year had a kid with the same name.", "No OP is hurt that her family had so little respect for her. If they cared about her they wouldn't have suggested that name. It's called kindness.", "They\u2019re not naming for her daughter. They\u2019re potentially naming for the grandmother.", "I know it\u2019s a rhetorical question, of course they wouldn\u2019t have considered using the name if your daughter had lived longer. I don\u2019t blame you for being hurt. It seems as though your daughter doesn\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d to them - or at least no to G. I don\u2019t know if explaining this to G would have helped or not, she seems to struggle with empathy.", "AITA for not wanting to use my cousin's name is the question, and she is. Her reasoning is perfectly valid and Gloria and Ann seem really insensivitive, but it doesn't change that Gloria was her daughter too.", "The aunt suggesting the name lost her mom there seems to be no regard for her or her feelings either. Like I understand they seem to be shitty people but that doesn\u2019t change the facts of what\u2019s been presented to the sub for judgement.", "What\u2019s also out of your control is if that name is ever used again. It\u2019s a family name because it was the name of family. It\u2019s a family name because your grandma and your daughter had it. Don\u2019t feel guilty for using it. Seek therapy for your grief.", "Within a year of my paternal grandmother\u2019s passing, she had three namesakes. Had something happened to one, she would have still had two. Our tradition is that a child born within the year gets the name of the deceased. And there\u2019s an obligation until someone gives the name period.\n\nMy oldest daughter is named for my great-grandmother. She almost died at two months and is still severely disabled. Family members still give the name. I have no issue with it.\n\nMy aunt named her second stillborn baby \u201cHope\u201d. My sister named my beautiful niece Hope as well. My aunt has never said a word. \n\nI know it hurts. But this is normal. You weren\u2019t the only one who loved your grandmother and wanted to honour her. The name is going to be used again within your family. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting down votes. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "So you made a Tik tok about her but she can\u2019t make a Facebook post about you? You\u2019re knee deep in this muck trying to perpetuate it. She owes you an apply before you\u2019ll take down your post but the same isn\u2019t required of you? You all suck", "And your aunts mom being dead?", "She said Ann understood, so it's only Granny Gloria who's pushing the issue.", "An elderly lady dying is not the same tragedy as a new born dying", "It\u2019s very different. \nThere is nothing worse than losing a child.", "True, but this is very very cold. Having to share a name with your recently dead cousin is not nice. There are tons of names, could even take grandma's second name. Insistence of taking a dead kid name is just cold and lack basic empathy (and respect)", "But why would Ann want a constant reminder of a dead child when she looked at her daughter? The name is off-limits now, NTA", "Yeah of course there are families with naming traditions. Those traditions don\u2019t appear to exist in OPs family though. Snd it\u2019s ok to break traditions if they cause a loved and valued family member pain.", "Ok cool. Sounds like that\u2019s normal in your family. That tradition doesn\u2019t seem to exist in OPs family.", "Even if it was your cousin\u2019s dead baby\u2019s name? And you knew she was really upset about it?", "Why? My paternal grandmother had three namesakes within a year of her death. She\u2019ll likely have many more in the years to come. My great-grandmother had a namesake 30 days after she died, and there have been others born over the years. \n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t the answer be \u2018yes, of course\u2019? They weren\u2019t considering naming the baby for OP\u2019s child, but for their mutual grandmother!", "So after the incident at xmas and Glroia commented on another status where Ann was talking about more names she liked and said \u201ci thought you were using Audrey?\u201d Or something along those lines. I messaged her and told her how i felt. And her only response was that i \u201cshouldnt talk to her that way shes my elder\u201d like girl come tf on im almost 30 i can message you and tell you your actions hurt me. Lol shes just your standard self serving boomer when it comes down to it.", "Losing a parent at an old age is not the same loss as s new born baby and you know it.", "I do go to therapy! Child loss isnt fluid and doesn\u2019t go away. People think you go to therapy and \u201cget over it\u201d and \u201cmove on\u201d and you do in a lot of ways. But we were not meant to walk the earth without our kids. Its not natural or normal. Life \u201cgoes on\u201d for me, but just missing a part. I feel happiness but there is always something missing. I think it just really hurt that after i shared my feelings and wasnt rude my aunt kept publicly suggesting it like it was cousins dream baby name and i was keeping her from using it.", "My cousin and I both gave our sons the same name. They are both named after their grandfathers who passed on dads side. \n\nMy cousin asked if I was okay. I turned around and jokes to cousin and grandma \u201cyou\u2019ll have one less name to remember.\u201d", "Stop commenting the same thing as if that\u2019s normal in every family. It sounds like a very specific tradition in your family that does not exist in this family.", "And you\u2019re a self serving entitled millennial. It was her mothers name, why can\u2019t anyone else in the family use it. She doesn\u2019t owe you anything.", "Losing anyone at any ages fkn sucks doesn\u2019t matter how old they are.", "I\u2019m not saying you need to move on or get over it I know greif and child loss aren\u2019t fluid. But you don\u2019t own a name. You can be hurt that your aunt wasn\u2019t as kind as you would like but she wanted her mother honored the same way you wanted that same woman honored. Your feelings are your own and you were keeping her from choosing it, only an asshole is going to choose it after you made them feel like such shit for even considering the same name despite sharing the same relation to the same loved one.", "Of course it sucks but you\u2019re being disingenuous if you can\u2019t admit that a parent dying in old age is a different experience to losing a new born. We grow up knowing our parents will leave us. We have our whole lives to prepare. No one expects their new born to die.", "I agree. my cousin is my aunts granddaughter. So she doesn\u2019t have the same relation i have. I wasnt mean about it until the snarky comment was made at xmas. Ty for your perspective!", "But your aunt does have the close relation. Hence, she wanted that same woman, honored it doesn\u2019t matter your cousin\u2019s relation. I didn\u2019t know my great great grandmother, but I still honor her with my daughters name, see how that works. You became the asshole when you were rude in an email and then took it to Tiktok and here especially since the child isn\u2019t even named that so you\u2019re still dwelling on it after the fact that\u2019s why I think you need more therapy.", "For the record, I knew and loved my great-grandmother quite well. And my kids are very close with their great-grandfather. It\u2019s quite possible that the relationship was closer than you realized or meant more to your cousin than you knew.", "Its being dwelled on again she made a post about me on facebook yesterday. Months later after the baby had already been names something different. She could\u2019ve just messaged me and i likely wouldve taken it down as long as she apologized. \nMy cousin also has added my husband on snapchat twice now, and added him onto her private story were she post her nudes for sale. Which js just bonkers.\nAt this point i now know they have no regard for my feelings and i cut them all off.\nMy dad will no longer be inviting them to functions.", "It\u2019s being dwelled on BECAUSE you made a tiktok talking shit. Her mother was also a living breathing person who is no longer alive and you seem to have no regard for that.", "those are irrelevant to the question you asked in the post.", "Op you\u2019re so much better than me because I would whoop her ass for that omgggg"]}
