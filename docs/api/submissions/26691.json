It also doesn't sound as if your cousin even wants the name in the first place. No you do not own the name but gosh they could have a little grace and decorum about the whole situation. NTA", "My daughters name was Audrey and Audrey wasn\u2019t even my grandmother\u2019s legal name. Her legal name was Audra and i was 100% okay with that being used. i was also okay with Audrey as a middle name. \n\nCousin did pick another name in the end. I also let cousin know when this all first happened if she truly wanted to use the name i would respect that bc i understood. I wasnt even really upset with my cousin at all. \n\nThe Tiktok wasn\u2019t a bullying post, it was a question for the grieving parents community on the platform. I didn\u2019t use any names.  \n\nIts just the struggle i will face with my dad, and his other siblings of them constantly trying to get me to just forget about the way i was treated. I can \u201cforgive\u201d but I wont forget.\n\nI go to therapy regularly. I feel like the people on here saying \u201cgo to therapy\u201d don\u2019t realize therapy is not a way to get over trauma, its a way to process it and learn how to recognize feelings and move past them when needed. Trauma is not a switch you turn on and off. Its a side effect from an event that stays with you forever. \n\nMy feelings about Audreys death when I was 21 and now when I\u2019m 27 are completely different and will continue to change. \n\nThe grief of losing a child never ever goes away. No matter how much therapy you do or how many times people tell you to \u201cget over it\u201d. \n\nGood parents have a deep routed connection with their kids and living without one of them, is like never ever being able to take in a full breath after coming up from underwater. The sun shines, and it feels warm and comforting on your skin, but you always wonder how it would\u2019ve felt on your childs skin. When my second daughter giggles, it makes me so happy, but there is always this tiny thought in my head \u201chow would Audreys giggle sound?\u201d\n\nIt hurts that Audrey seemed to have meant nothing to my aunt. Yeah Gloria was an ass my whole life, but that wasn\u2019t something I realized until i started asking people why she never showed at the hospital and i started remembering her snide comments from my childhood. And when she did all this - I saw her for who she is finally. But its still a big part of life I have to let go off. Bc she wasn\u2019t all bad all the time. Gloria was just good at hiding who she really was.", "NTA. Your aunt and cousin should have been more sensitive to your loss and not put that name on the list. Yes, it's true that no one owns a name, but in this situation, I think a little compassion on their part would have been appropriate. There are so many beautiful names out there; they could have easily compiled a list without the one name that belonged to your daughter. Your little girl mattered, OP, and I am so sorry for your loss.", "Sorry to be harsh op, but *you* are the one who feels entitled to your grandmother\u2019s name. Also, because it\u2019s your grandmother\u2019s name that means *it\u2019s a family name*.  This is not about hurting you, it\u2019s about them honoring your grandmother\u2019s memory. YTA.", "YTA. I understand this entire thing is very painful to you. The loss of a child is unbearable. That said you don't own this name. Your family should understand this is hurtful but they don't care for whatever reason. \n\nAt this point you need to stop engaging these people and let things simmer down. They may or may not name their child this name.", "Sorry but YTA my daughter is named after my granny\u2019s granny\u2026 so is my cousin, so is my great uncle \u2026 no one owns a name", "I am very sorry for your loss. I can\u2019t imagine losing a baby, and I don\u2019t know how I would ever get over it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be hard but I do think that your cousin can name her daughter after her grandmother. They are very insensitive how they approached it I think, she could have talked to you about it and they should not dismiss your feelings or your loss. But I think for you to make a video and post it online and to feel like you own a name that is a family name because your grandmother also had that name does make you in the wrong. I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole though.", "Our son (19) died in November. Obviously, we are all devastated. OP, you are right - you are not meant to live without your kids. There is nothing in nature that prepares us to survive that loss. I know I am forever changed, as are you. \n\nOur middle son (18) informed us a few months ago that his gf is pregnant. He plans to name his child after his brother (as a middle name). He wanted to do a first name, but he knew that would be too hard for me. \n\nI know the difference is that he's using the name to honor my deceased child (his brother), and your cousin was only considering it for the same reason you did - bc of the grandmother. \n\nBecause I understand how hard it would be to hear the name all the time, I'm going to say softly, ESH.  Only bc I also know that if my son had chosen to use his brother's name as a first name for his child, I would just have to find a way to deal with it. And as hard as it is, you would have to also if this cousin (or a future family member) chooses to use the grandmother's name. \n I am fortunate that my son considered my feelings in using the name where your family did not. Your aunt sucks for not even attempting to pretend to understand your feelings. \n\nIt seems your cousin understood the difficulty you would face, and I am glad she ended up picking something else. Perhaps try working on name exposure in therapy in case a future relative chooses to honor the grandmother with the name. That way you can hear the name without crumbling. \n\nSo sorry for your loss. I wish you peace and healing.", "People don\u2019t own names, even when it\u2019s sad.\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\nStop seeing these people. \nYou made the TikTok, you can\u2019t control the responses.\n\nI have 8 first cousins with the exact same first name as me. It\u2019s our grandma\u2019s name.", "YTA in my opinion. \nYou don't own the name and are not entitled to it forever. What happened with your baby is ofc devastating. But that does not mean this name should be vetoed for the rest of your family forever. \nIt's great that she chose a different name but someone might still use it, so you should prepare yourself for that.", "NTA. I have a feeling that if your cousin came to you to respectfully discuss the name that it wouldn\u2019t have been as painful. Having the name added to a list of names as if it was just an option that didn\u2019t carry some sort of weight was wrong and dismissive of what you have gone through.\n\nI have a child who has the same name as a cousins ex-boyfriend that she had dated for years. I knew something bad had happened between them but didn\u2019t know the extent. I didn\u2019t even throw that name around without mentioning it to her first to be sure there wasn\u2019t any pain or trauma associated with that name. Family shouldn\u2019t want to cause each other pain and should address sensitive subjects with love and understanding.  I\u2019m sorry that wasn\u2019t done for you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and thankful your cousin went with another name.", "ESH.  In spite of what you think, your grandmother\u2019s name is a family name.  Anyone has the right to use it.  If your cousin wants to use it to honor her great grandmother that is perfectly fair.  That\u2019s not to say that I can\u2019t bother you or being up the feelings surrounding losing your daughter who was named after grandma/great grandma too.  Your aunt definitely suck because she\u2019s being obnoxious.  If she had just nicely pointed out that Audrey was her granddaughter\u2019s grandmother too, it would have been fine.

Now, it's ESH instead of YTA, because it appears you did ask them not to choose that name and their reaction was to choose it anyway, but since it's your grandmother's name, that's well within their right to use for the same reasons. Your gatekeeping of the name sucks, but your aunt's possessiveness of the name in spite of you also sucks.", "NTA. Your aunt is a d-bag though, and I feel bad for your cousin. (And you, of course, you\u2019ve experienced something that no parent should ever have to endure.) But it sounds as though your aunt was pushing this name on your cousin\u2019s child, even after she didn\u2019t want it. If your cousin had actually been keen on the name, or expressed interest in it on her own, I would be hurt- but also understanding, as it\u2019s what your grandmother went by, or a modified version of that. I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019d push for \u201cAudrey\u201d and not \u201cAudra\u201d if that was her mother\u2019s name though, it sounds like she\u2019s just trying to hurt you by doing that. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for the loss of your daughter, my heart goes out to you truly. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, maybe a little petty for the TikTok, but it\u2019s not like any of it was wrong, or made up, or a lie. Your aunt basically did the same exact thing on Facebook, but she doesn\u2019t see that she was actually wrong for any of this. It\u2019s so strange that she kept pushing for it, even after Ann said she was using another name, like why are you still bringing this up?!\n\nI don\u2019t understand people saying Y T A here, like yes of course you\u2019re not \u201centitled\u201d to the name, but I think you know that. Hell, I named my daughter after my partner\u2019s grandmother who is very much still alive and well. We asked her if it would be okay with her first, and she loved the idea so that\u2019s what we went with. It wasn\u2019t exactly a \u201cfamily name\u201d until now, she\u2019s the only one with the name, aside from our daughter. BUT we\u2019re the first of her grandkids to have a girl, I wouldn\u2019t be at all shocked if there\u2019s another baby girl in his family that gets named the same thing in the coming years, and I don\u2019t mind that. It\u2019s a lot different for you, you unfortunately lost your daughter, and clearly your family is aware. It was really insensitive of your aunt to suggest it in the first place, knowing what she knows. That really changes things, and I think had they asked you instead of you just seeing it on Facebook, it would be a different situation. I\u2019m sure that was just shocking to see and I can\u2019t imagine. Good luck with your terrible aunt, OP. (And I\u2019m glad your cousin chose a different name for her baby.

It\u2019s not the norm for Aunt\u2019s who aren\u2019t close to visit in the hospital when a baby is born, and very much not the norm when the baby is critically ill - random Aunt Gloria is doomed if she stays away, and doomed if she visits and annoys you in those precious few days.

Since she did not, while it is tragic, having the cousin's kid called Audrey would mean that name is kept in the family.\n\nOP is, naturally, distraught, and the aunt hasn't handled things in the best way, but that doesn't mean the cousin shouldn't name her kid that.", "\"A true elder knows that respect goes both ways...and offers it first.\"", "\"Some antiques are treasures, others are just old trash.\"", "\"Some people grow old & wise, others just grow old.\"", "\"Everything ages. Not everything ages well.\"", "Yup. One side of the family is now going on 50+ people but we all meet up annually so they're all just \"cousins\" and \"younger cousins\"", "I am on the fence here somewhat but just to point out, OP lost the child 6 years ago so not so \u201crecently deceased\u201d. I\u2019m sure that the pain is absolutely still there but I\u2019m not sure if the grandmothers name should be off limits forever. It\u2019s a tough situation but there was some time between this.", "Also Ann doesn't, she's chill about it anyway. It's someone else pushing for it.", "I think it is implied by the relatives who took Gloria's side.", "Yes. I've read most of those books and that one was sooooo fucked up!", "Yes I know , not trying to spoil it for others....", "THIS THIS THIS", "Thanks for your help today lol", "Let's not forget that people who I'm migrated to New England invented vampires when women who died of consumption didn't fully decompose after being buried *in the middle of winter in New England*... literally where Bram Stoker got the idea.", "My niece was stillborn. We knew her. The bond she had with my SIL was them knowing each other.\n\nDamn when I met her, she was perfect and I don\u2019t like babies. She had my brother\u2019s nose.", "reminds me of that scene in the 1st My Big Fat Greet Wedding movie where all of the (dozens of) cousins are Anita, Diane, and Nick \ud83d\ude02 https://youtu.be/5JkQvRdvhG8?si=0EIEq\\_c\\_TQGcKqCI&t=31", "Wow. People are morons! When my cousin passed, my aunt said that had she not had other children she had to push forward for, she may have given up. I couldn\u2019t imagine the immeasurable hole in your heart. Good luck w everything in the future!", "The difference here was the OP\u2019s daughter lived 4 days so she would have had both a birth certificate as well as a death certificate. In the NICU her crib would have her name on the incubator. PS so sorry for your loss. My sister lost 2 and my niece lost her 7 month old due to CHD.", "Thank you and yes, my older boys and my husband were definitely why I bothered getting up in the morning at first, before I started to find the will to do it for my own sake."]}
