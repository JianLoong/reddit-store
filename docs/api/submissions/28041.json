I offered to let them come back to our hotel room as long as everyone agreed to stay relatively quiet. \n\nMy husband, myself, and six others came back to our room. We all shared a bottle of wine, talked until about 1 A.M., then they left and we went to sleep. \n\nI woke up today - a week later - and had received a text from my sister saying she didn\u2019t appreciate that I hosted an \u201cafter party\u201d of my own.

If you and your husband decided not to join the afterparty, that\u2019s fine. All you had to do was to turn it down and chill by yourselves or however you and your husband wanted to end the night. But you actually INVITED other people to join you when they had the choice to go do their own chill night cap or join your sisters\u2019 afterparty. As you said, you \u201coffered to let them come back to our hotel room\u201d. You literally hosted your own afterparty. Not cool.", "YTA, you literally did! It's about showing face and dealing with it or telling them directly that it's not your kind of party and respectfully exit. Golden child energy is 100%. Asking your mom whether youa re the golden child.. you can probably see why that's wrong right? Or maybe not.", "YTA. If you\u2019re going to not attend her after party fine, don\u2019t also invite the same people and host your own gathering.", "YTA\n\nNot wanting to attend her afterparty, fine. I get that. Cracking a bottle with your hubby back at the hotel, fine. *Inviting guests to your party when they're already invited to hers, as* ***part of her wedding celebration,*** *is not fine.* You did exactly what she accused you of. You could be right and those folks may have not gone to her shindig no matter what, but this was really poor behavior.", "INFO:  Can you give some examples of the golden child antics she's referring to?  Has something similar to this happened before?", "I can't believe you even have to ask. Of course, YTA. So, so massively the asshole.", "YTA hosting guests of a wedding during a wedding event is tacky and rude. If you didn\u2019t want to go have more drunken antics what the fuck is staying up till 1 drinking?", "YTA sorry but if you wanted to catch up with these people and party, you should\u2019ve either stayed for the after party or gotten together the next day. Doing this the way you did was tacky and excluded your sister on her wedding day. \n\nLook at it this way, you are having a birthday party and a large group of your friends decide with, your sister prompting, that they were going to go have a party and not invite you. You would feel like crap for that and that\u2019s just a birthday.\n\nAs for the golden child comment, you said yourself that your parents always celebrated you for the three As (athletics, arts, academics). That\u2019s where she was feeling second best and then you decided on her wedding day, to throw a party with some of her friends. I can definitely see how that would make her feel second best again.\n\nApologize to her and I would suggest working on your relationship with her if you want to have one. It\u2019s usually is situations like this where someone goes LC/NC for their own mental health.", "YTA..   if you wanted to chill, go do it yourself, don't invite your sisters guests to join you. That is literally a horrible thing to do", "YTA. if you don\u2019t want to go to her party that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t talk other guests into coming with you. It\u2019s her day.", "I don\u2019t get it - if people are already leaving the wedding and they decide to have a small gathering, how is it even op\u2019s fault?

Honestly thought you were saying people left the reception itself to go with y'all. Also didn't realize that after reception parties were common?\n\nIf only a few people wanted to stay up even later partying then that was going to be the case, whether with y'all or not. I am curious though if she found out that you had people with you because one of the 2 people she didn't invite after brought up the fact they weren't invited to hers. \n\nCan't really comment on the golden child remark since we don't know your lives. But I'd recommend figuring out whether and why she's feeling that way/lashing out with that for the sake of your relationship with her.", "NTA\n\nYour sister's wedding ended when the reception was over.  She doesn't get to make decisions for others, and if they wanted a chilled night cap they probably would have skipped the post wedding celebration anyway.", "NTA. I've never heard of a party after the reception. In my experience the reception generally ends close to midnight, and then people head to bed, or, as you did have a drink to just chill at the end of the night", "NTA...\n\nEveryone went to the ceremony. Everyone went to the reception. The bride and groom decided to keep partying elsewhere, and invited a handful of people along for more drunken shenanigans. \n\nAn invitation is not a summons.\n\nYou had a babysitter to send home. You were more up for conversation and a few social drinks. Others agreed that they'd rather wind down the night than amp it up. And one bottle of wine between 8 people? If split evenly, no one even had a full glass. So clearly, these people weren't likely to be heading out to a bar/club for cocktails, shots, and music you feel more than hear regardless of your room being on offer as a gathering space or not.\n\nAnd her after party was a secret? Why? That's pretty much how you assure yourself a tiny guest list. And the non-invitees will find out about it later, guaranteed. The bride sounds like a drama queen.", "NTA, if your sister is going to be upset with anyone it should be the guests that came to your room instead of with her. She can't hold you accountable for what others chose to do with their time.", "NTA.\n\n\nAll the people involved didn't want to go to the main party anyway.\nYou didn't \"steal\" anyone. If they hadn't gone to your hotel room they would've gone to bed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The thing that really annoyed her was despite me being an introvert, I still had a pretty large group of friends. There was a lot of jealousy there I think, but this was back in high school. I thought we had moved on from that \u2014 it\u2019s been years and I haven\u2019t spoken to many of those people in just as long. High school friendships (while some are still very important to me) aren\u2019t something I would hold a grudge over. \n\nI will say though, I do live out of state now and I think that caused some of the anger in this situation. A lot of family and friends hadn\u2019t seen us in a while and were eager to catch up with my husband and I, and see our children. She was annoyed about that and mentioned it over the phone, but that was more of a side issue.", "This 100%..", "This. TIL that a post-reception after party is \"customary\"?? I did not know this.

She's especially frustrated that she's been left out of a party that is literally on her wedding day.  With her planned guests.  I think it's valid that she's upset.  \n\nI think you could have been more mindful about who you invited to your after party.  You should have anticipated that she would feel as though you'd stolen her guests.  Remember that she hoped to have plans with these guests.  She'd probably made these plans way in advance.  \n\nTo see them go home because they're tired might hurt her feelings a little, but she'd likely understand.  But to see that you and many of her planned guests met up together for a gathering during her after party.  I can see how she'd find that hurtful.  You could have been more considerate about this.  Inviting one or two people to drink with you would have been ok.  Inviting six created a party that was twice the size of her own party.

Your relationships with friends has nothing to do with being a golden child.", "I mentioned these issues between my sister and I because I felt like they were the most relevant. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t have many stories about my parents treating me differently other than general parental comparisons that we all endure. My parents pretty consistently joked that I somehow was the child who got the three A\u2019s \u2014 academics, athletics, and art - when they\u2019re usually spread among the kids. That\u2019s the only thing I can think of as something that might have rubbed her the wrong way, but this was just praise for me, not meant as a slight towards her.", "\"My parents joked that I got all the talents and my siblings got none, but that's not a slight on my siblings.\" You've 100% proven, in this one comment, that you were the golden child and it was not fair to her.", "Lol to paraphrase\u2026my parents said I\u2019m perfect at anything but I have no clue how that means I\u2019m the golden child\u2026"]}
