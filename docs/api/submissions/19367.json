There is absolutely nothing funny about sexualizing your teenage granddaughter.", "NTA, but perhaps you should have a talk with your sister about your niece's Internet postings. My bet is that 49K of those followers are adult men.", "NTA. \n\nYour grandpa is why we used to rescue girls when they hugged that creepy uncle. \n\nUntil someone wakes him up, he's going to keep trying to letch onto young girls inappropriately.

You\u2019re absolutely correct, that is beyond creepy and weird - especially from your nieces GRANDFATHER! I would have gone off too. Good for you to stand up for your niece.
