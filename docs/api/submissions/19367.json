I just sat on the couch eating my cereal as if I hadn\u2019t seen a thing. \n\nGrandpa\u2019s chair was right by the front door, so I would give him a hug on the way out. Until that fateful day!! When I leaned down to hug him, my braid fell over my shoulder. He grabbed my braid, tugged it, and grunted \u201cyour hair makes me so horny\u201d. Like WTF grandpa!! \n\nAfter that, when I came over, I\u2019d call my friend and she\u2019d open the garage door. That way I could get to the rest of the house and not have to go near grandpa.", "I don't think it's dementia because I doubt he'd know what Onlyfans is... idk, one of my parents' work colleague was recently rescued in his house and he thought we were still in 2019.", "Abusers don\u2019t give a shit and will revert to \u201cStop being so sensitive, I don\u2019t have to explain a joke. Everyone else gets it!\u201d\n\nThe best way to deal with abusive individuals is to limit interaction and maintain strong consistent boundaries if needed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support any adult man sexualizing a young girl. I\u2019m not willing to minimize that kind of behavior.\u201d", "Yeah ask him to explain in detail at the family dinner, what exactly will he look at on her onlyfans? what parts? make him explain. He will probably not get it but the other idiots defending him might perhaps wake up and realize how perverted and predatory he is.  \n\n\n100% NTA", "It definitely doesn't sound like anything a reasonable adult could accept, so that means they are not reasonable adults. They are simply gross in their acceptance of gross behavior.", "Thank you", "I mean when my grandpa got dementia he would go around telling people he used to be a farmer in Cuba. He was a journalist from Brooklyn.", "oh my GODDDDDDDDDD \n\nno one cares at all about what you have to say. HUSH \n\nLiterally 39085378729832802 other comments say the same shit. Stop attention seeking", "Because this unfortunately IS a gendered thing.", "no your right that\u2019s definitely the same as your own grandfather wanting to bone you", "Make your own post if you want to complain instead of trying to make this post about you. You're also not a teenager who's being sexualized by her family member", "It's all patriarchy baby, fight the system not the people!", "i\u2019d be willing to bet at least 25k of them are grown men. there\u2019s no innocent reason for a grown man to follow a teenage girl on social media.", "Doesn't matter *how*, it matters that she'll have 50 thousand eyeballs staring at her, commenting, and probably trying to contact her via other means. The internet is filled with creeps. I don't think that those 50k followers are all fellow tweens.", "She was probably so uncomfortable that she stayed silent and in the background. That's what I did when similar things happened to me.", "Why?", "One of the first signs is the deterioration of the filters. They will start blurting out whatever comes to mind.", "Reporting bot account", "That\u2019s why you don\u2019t do it in a hostile way. You act like you are genuinely confused and their ego compels them to try usually.\n\nThe absolute best way is to avoid them and establish boundaries but sometimes life puts you with them and embarrassing them even for a second is usually a good way to ensure they don\u2019t bring it up around you for the time being.", "I would agree with not calling it reasonable. I was just pointing out the reason it happens.", "It\u2019s like, we\u2019re talking about predatory men right now because that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in this situation. There\u2019s a time and a place for discussion on predatory women and it\u2019s not on a post about an old man being creepy.", "Wow, must have hit the target.", "How? This is something that happens to and by both genders.", "I didn\u2019t say it was the same.", "Not wanting to be uncomfortably sexualised requires an age limit as well as being exclusive to one gender.\n\nAm I on r/teenagers?", "I'm sorry for the experiences that led you to this worldview and sincerely wish you a safe and happy life in the future.", "Probably not.  Fortunately, contacts and allowing comments are something parents are able to control, while someone staring at a screen image does not actually suck the soul out of the original.", "Very true, so depressing. I hope OP just tries to empower her, she deserves a grandfather that's not a total creep.", "Right omg leave it to a bunch of basement dwelling redditors to jump on a comment \"wOmEn Do It ToO\" \n\nYeah we know.

YES, all objectification/ undesired sexualization deserves to be called out, especially when it\u2019s of minors. NO, a post about a 70 yr old man sexualizing his *granddaughter* whole family members actively brush it off as \u201cthat\u2019s just who he is\u201d isn\u2019t the fucking place to talk about how \u2018actually, old women do it too\u2019!", "The issue isn't talking about predatory men here and not women.

But broadly painting a brush to just hate on a specific group in its entirety like you did is sad", "But it is *men* not this individual man. If any other man at the table had decided to start sexualizing the kiddies, it would have been accepted too. That's why \"creepy uncle\" is a trope. It's a systemic issues based on the assumption that men naturally have sexual humor and that it's normal to do so.", "Well, to be fair, everyone except for OP was giving the grandad a pass. That included women. Women were also problematic in the described situation. I would even go as far as saying that *to a certain extent* ('a certain extent' being important), making excuses for predators is, in itself, predatory - and in that sense, there were both male and female predators present.   \n\n\nAlso, you're making broad, unfounded accusations towards all men, yet you're loudly complaining when someone says a single word about women, or tries to hint that maybe it's not as simple as \"all men bad\".

That's... incredibly odd.", ">But it is men not this individual man.\n\nNo, the issue is assholes/predators/whatever you want to call them. This man, OPs father, is an asshole. Any other man who sexualized OPs niece, also an asshole. The men who defended OPs father, also all assholes.\n\nBut so are the women who defended OPs father. And so are women that sexualize young men.\n\nAnd yes, creepy uncle is a trope. But so is women ogling the pool boy. The issue in both of these tropes is the creepiness, not that it's men or women.\n\nAnd yet, if there were a post about a woman creeping on some younger guy, and I made a comment about all women, based solely off that one instance, I'd be an asshole. Because it's wrong to paint all women with that same brush, just as it's wrong to paint all men with that same brush.", "And sad"]}
