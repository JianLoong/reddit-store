Your niece is a very lucky person to have you in her life.  It is not normal and should be shamed at every opportunity.  Good on you!!!", "NTA he is being inappropriate. Especially asking about OFs. Not sure how any reasonable adult could stomach that being said to a minor.", "NTA, but a little shocked parents are happy when a teenage daughter has 50k TikTok fans. That's just not healthy", "NTA my father who is newly the same age would NEVER make that kind of comments, for two reasons\n\n1) he isn\u2019t an arsehole\n\n2) he isn\u2019t a closet pedo", "Predator behavior. There is absolutely nothing funny about sexualizing your teenage granddaughter.", "NTA, but perhaps you should have a talk with your sister about your niece's Internet postings. My bet is that 49K of those followers are adult men.", "NTA. \n\nYour grandpa is why we used to rescue girls when they hugged that creepy uncle. \n\nUntil someone wakes him up, he's going to keep trying to letch onto young girls inappropriately. As long as he keeps doing so, PLEASE keep standing up for her and pointing out his inappropriate behavior.", "ESH, your old man is an AH for making creepy comments about teen girls.\n\nYou\u2019re an AH for not sucker punching him after the OF comment.\n\nEdit: oh yah, your brother is an AH too for letting his daughter\u2019s TikTok get out of control.", "NTA.  Ask everyone out loud when they think a kid is old enough for her grandfather to sexualize her and see what they think the recommended age is. \n\nIt\u2019s never.", "A classic way of making them uncomfortable is to put on a clueless/questioning face and say. \"I don't get it, can you please explain the joke for me\" and keep asking questions (in a non aggressive way) when they try to normalise the behaviour.", "NTA \n\nYour dad is objectifying your daughter. It sounds very creepy.", "NTA. Barf.", "NTA. \n\nAnd it's hugely valuable for young women that the men in their families do stand up in this kind of way\\*\n\n(\\*Unless she directly asks you not to, in which case maybe don't, or at least make clear that your comments are about \\*you\\* finding his behavior offensive and inappropriate, not about her directly)\n\n. Another time, if anyone suggests you are making family gatherings awkward, a response such as 'No, Dad's inappropriate, creepy comments are making it awkward. Are you really OK with an elderly man sexualising a 16 year old, especially one who is his own granddaughter?'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they say he's joking, then try 'Really? Jokes are funny. Explain to me exactly how that's funny' \n\nMy dad turned 77 this year. I have \\*never\\* heard him make any comments of that kind because he knows they would totally inappropriate - Heck, my sisters and I were teens 20mumble years ago and it wasn't appropriate then, let alone now.", "Just to add - if your dad was just monumentally clueless then his reaction when you pointed out how inappropriate it was would be \"OMG, I never saw it that way \" He's be mortified, embarrassed and he would stop. Because that's how people who genuinely didn't know their language or comments were inappropriate w but who weren't trying to offend or behave inappropriately would respond. Maybe not instantly, because anger is often a response to being embraced, but as as soon as they have had time to calm down.", "If this is a new development, I wonder if dad is developing dementia?\n\nIf he's always been inappropriate, then obviously NTA.\n\nIf it could be dementia, you're still NTA, but it might be worthwhile highlighting this to your family.\n\nRegardless, granddaughter should not be left alone with grandfather.", "NTA\n\nand her parents are ok with this? disgusting", "Absolutely NTA, my dad is in his 70s and though he doesn\u2019t have granddaughters, there are plenty of cousins with young girls, my dad doesn\u2019t make any comments like that about family. You\u2019re absolutely correct, that is beyond creepy and weird - especially from your nieces GRANDFATHER! I would have gone off too. Good for you to stand up for your niece. Your family is more worried about dad\u2019s feelings than making your niece feel protected. Stand your ground OP!", "ugh men get a free pass for literally anything NTA", "Disagree on two fronts.  Sucker punching is assault, so OP is not an asshole there.  Brother isn\u2019t an asshole either.  She\u2019s 16 and more than capable of managing her following.  Brother should be prepared to help his daughter anytime she asks, however.", "Yes, it's always the men. \n\nPs. Women can get away with a loooot more when it comes to sexualizing younger people. But let's not have that discussion", "*Me being constantly sexualised by older women as a barista and not making such a blanket statement:* Too right sista!", "OP needs to assert dominance or else the comments will continue & no one will take him seriously . Maybe a wedgie or a throwing a pint of beer in his face would be more appropriate the next time it happens.", "No, I wouldn\u2019t even go that far.  Maybe speaking loudly so everyone can hear what the creep is saying will get the job done.  But any physical action will make OP the asshole.", "Really? If I was OP\u2019s brother, I would have curbed stomped my dad at Thanksgiving dinner for making a comment like that about my daughter. If OP\u2019s brother was in attendance during that dinner then he\u2019s definitely an AH for not defending his daughter."]}
