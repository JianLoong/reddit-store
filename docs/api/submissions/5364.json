Unless OP is down for the cause it's perfectly reasonable for him to keep the peace in that relationship.\n\nBesides, how she wants him to use the wealth \"for the betterment of society\" is probably a subjective thing at best. Someone should take a hard look at how Grandpa has done his business dealings. Are they racist and whatever-phobic as implied here? If not then bug off.

I did read it \ud83d\ude18\n\nSo first: it doesn't sound like his mind would be open, but I don't know him (and I assume you don't either) and we can not definitely say either way.\n\nSecond: the OP didn't say which causes they want to support. If they're suggesting something like a LGBTQ charity, I can see him not even considering it because it doesn't align with his views. But what if it's for a children's school lunch program or something else that isn't as divisive? Or what if they want to make a foundation in his name, and he gets to have an input on the charity? So maybe his mind doesn't even need to be changed. These vital details are missing, and could make a massive impact on whether or not they even have a shot at getting his money.", "The others are AH too for the same reasons.", "Well I'm black so yeah I'd choose not to have a racist grandpa in my life. Infact I already cut out the racist family members from my life. Their money isn't worth it.", "I'd tell them if they're feeling so strongly about this, they can sell what grandpa gave them and invest it in bettering the world how they see fit.", ">My parents are threatening to cut me out of a 6 figure inheritance because I'm not willing to put up with racist, sexist, and classist bullshit.\n\nMy response was 'Go ahead.',\n\n\nGood FOR YOU. I am a POC and even I will not say Op sucks for not playing this game to get all they can.\n\nYou do you", "I'm with you on this. If the grandfather is a multi-millionaire/billionaire, having that money and those options means that I could use my life and money for good and to fight for the benefit of society instead of just \"getting by.\" If the grandfather isn't giving the money to family members, I can only imagine what kind of horrifying causes he'd be donating to. \n\nSo if my own life gets better, and I am able to make the world a better place while avoiding grandpa giving money to fellow racists, I don't see the problem.", "Thanks", "Thanks", "It's not about leeway, it's about likelihood to change. Sure, you can try to stand your ground and make your point towards someone who's 90, but the probability of success is so ridiculously low, that I wonder what the point is....\n\nFor example, my grandpa didn't vote, he wasn't on any internet forums, his views didn't really impact anyone except the immediate family who he told about them. So we all rolled out eyes and went on about our day, and let him have his views until he died.", "I mean true that... But still it sounds easy on paper (or digitally, whatever) but let the guy have his damn gift! The sister and cousins have already gotten their advantage, thats why they are free to do whatever.", "And they suck more considering they have got everything they want whilst op hasn't", "So it should be ESH then", "Well, I respect you for that decision, but I think it\u2019s fucking stupid.", "Yep. Bet they will all give reasons on why they can't.", "What if they do? Would that change your opinion?", "Agree. Grandpa is 80. His time left is most likely short. OP isn't going around defending Grandpa's beliefs or anything like that - he wants his inheritance. It's a tough world. Good for him for getting that house.", "'*I'll put up with racism and homophobia for a quick payday*' is not the flex you think it is.\n\nIt's literally the root of all evil.", "Absolutely, you would never change a 90years old view at this point.\n\nBut 82 years old today were 60 in the 2000. I think it is becoming more difficult to justify this kind of behaviour. Of course if someone has been an awful racist their whole life, they won't change at 80 or 90 years of age.", "Yep! They're all AH. especially now that they got what they wanted they suddenly have a conscience.", "They all suck the same cause they are all doing the same thing. They waited to try to get grandpa to change til after they got what they wanted. Op wants to do the same, they're all shitty people and this mindset (while popular) is a damn good reason as to why the world is so shitty today. If a lot more people stopped letting those in power do what they want just cause they want their money the world would be a different place.", "True.. I'll edit and change my judgement.", "Moral high horse riding on hypothetical wealth is very easy", "What's stupid is that people are against racism except for when money is involved.\n\nI choose not to be bought.", ">But 82 years old today were 60 in the 2000.\n\nI'm just rewatching Friends, which was made in late 90s early 2000s. I think you're overestimating how progressive that time period was.\n\nAnd also again, it's not about justification, it's about being realistic about what you can and cannot change. If the grandpa didn't become progressive 30 years ago, he definitely won't suddenly become progressive now. So what would be the point of OP foregoing free money.", "Again, I respect that, that\u2019s a strong fortitude. I\u2019d choose the house, though. In fact, I wish OP\u2019s grandpa was my grandpa.", "I wouldn't forego the free money either. In fact I stated he is not the AH.\n\nI understand what you are saying. But we can't let this happen much longer no? We can't just give up on people being racist and homophobic and telling ourselves they can't change now. Of course they won't change now, but it is becoming unacceptable to let them get to this point.\n\nUnfortunately, it is way easier to get away with it if you have that kind of money.", ">But we can't let this happen much longer no?\n\nI honestly don't think there will ever be a world entirely without racism and homophobia. But we can definitely do better than now, though I think it's more effective to focus on the newer generations, and just let the old ones die out \ud83d\ude0a"]}
