We never got along with each other and she always felt like she was trying to put a wedge between my friends and me. She has also done things like dated all my ex-boyfriends (?) and has done and said some pretty mean things about me to my face and behind my back. I have brought this up with my friends but they always have brushed it off and said that it's just us getting to know each and figuring things out.\n\nThe argument was about a credit card bill that she had racked up on my credit card. I had \"lost\" that credit card about three days before that and while it was lost Jelena was coming over with new designer clothing, new jewellery, etc. I found it strange that she could afford all of this since she was never rich and had money issues in the past. When this was happening, I decided to call my bank to cut my credit cards but they told me why would I, since I was purchasing so many things with it, such as a brand new Alexander McQueen Peplum Leather Biker Jacket ($5,455). Now I was shocked and told him that my credit card was stolen and for him to just cut the the cards. \n\nAfter, my friends and I decided to go out and Jelena was there. When I saw her I was shocked and asked her where she got that jacket and how was she able to afford it. She was gagged and tried to explain herself saying the that it was a gift to her finding it in a second had store. Now I called her out on the lie and told her that when I was on the phone with my bank that they had mentioned that exact jacket. In a corner she just decided to come clean and say she \"found\" the card on the floor and just picked it up. Now I was pissed and started arguing with her till things got physical and our friend head to pull us apart.\n\nAfter that I told her and them that if she doesn't pay me back that I'm going to press charges against her for stealing and left. Now my friends are blowing up my phone asking my to forgive her and to not press charges and that it was just a mistake.

This would be a perfect opportunity to exact justice and dispose of a pest at the same time. NTA", "NTA  If your 'friends' don't want you to press charges they can pay you the money themselves. What? They don't want to? Then they don't want her cleared very much, do they?", "NTA. That is far from a \u201cmistake.\u201d", "NTA\n\nFile a police report with your local police report immediately.  You may need to submit a copy of that report to avoid being responsible for the fraudulent charges on your card.", "Just pass GO and head straight to the police to file charges. Someone who deliberately does something like this knows it is stealing and does not care. Her lack of a moral compass is not your fault and should never have been your problem. As for your equally useless \"friends\" who defend her, take this situation for the blessing it is and Dump Them And Get New Friends because they are NOT, and I suspect never truly were, your friends. Being without friends for a while is ALWAYS better than being around toxic people who do not care for you. See the cops and clean house.\n\nNTA", "NTA Hey, I'm the forgiving type but that was pretty sleazy.  There is nothing in here that says you don't deserve your money back in one form or another.  Go through with your threat.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGive her 24 hours to give you back the money, then make a police report. Or make it 24 seconds - she KNOWLINGLY did this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Now my friends are blowing up my phone asking my to forgive her and to not press charges and that it was just a mistake.\" .. Ask them if THEY are going to repay you ... tell them it is either that, or shut up.", "NTA. She committed a serious crime. It goes without saying that you don\u2019t just start using a credit card you found on the floor. And as she knows you, it would\u2019ve been easy for her to return it. I encourage you to report her.", "NTA. I wouldn't even wait for her to repay you. If she stole your money she probably lying doesn't have any to repay you. Even if she did that could take months. In the meantime your card will carry an unpaid balance, and it'll keep getting bigger because of the interest. That will affect your credit. So go ahead and press charges.", "NTA! THERE AINT NOTHING TO FORGIVE HERE! SEND HER TO JAIL! OP, look...your credit card had your name and shit on it, right? So she could have sent your card to you or gave it to you anytime! But she didn't and started racking shit up on your card! Dont forgive nothing! Report her!", "The Credit card company seems sus to me.  We get a call if we charge more than $300 or $500 on a card.  For them not to flag a $5K purchase makes this whole situation sound fake to me.\n\nThe card should have been reported as lost immediately, and you should not have waited a couple of days to do that. \n\nYou need to file the police report, or you are going to be liable for all of the items that were purchased on your card before you reported it stolen.  Can you afford that?", "NTA and press charges. I knew a guy in high school that stole a credit card from a girls car in the parking lot, he went to prison for a year..and he sure as shit wasn't buying $5k designer clothes with the card either.", "NTA, she stole your credit card, used it illegally and then lied about it. Not sure how people who consider themselves to be \u2018your\u2019 friend would be condoning any of this. I\u2019d press charges.", "NTA. She stole the card and used it, even though she knew it wasn't hers.", "NTA, but it\u2019s not really your call anymore.\n\nFirst, you should have reported the card lost as soon as you couldn\u2019t find it.  Second, when you reported the false charges, they will take them off your bill, but someone is out thousands of dollars.  If it isn\u2019t you, it\u2019s the bank or the store.  That means someone is extremely motivated to figure out what happened.  \n\nIf they find her and then she says you let her do it to get out of a felony, all the sudden you are up on the fraud charge.  If you get money from her, that just shows you were in on the scam.  You are dangerously close to be liable for the debt or the crime.", "A mistake is not using someone else's card. That's theft. Anyone who would support her actions is a supporternof theft and no longer deserves your friendship. Report to the police. NTA", "NTA your credit card and your credit is at risk... scree them friends if it was them they would press charges fast...", "NTA, press charges on the thief 100%", "NTA I'm presuming since the one item alone you quoted is $5455 that she's managed to rack up enough debt on your stolen card to be charged with felony theft as if she'd stolen the items from the store (which by all intents & purposes she did by using your CC to facilitate her theft). Press the charges, report the individual transactions as fraud with your CC company & let them deal with her since she doesn't have the ability to pay you back.", "NTA - Definitely report.", "Nta. She will never repay you. Tell your credit card company who made the purchases.  Call the police and make the report. You may be on the hook for the purchases if you dont.", "Nta. Your story sounds shifty, but if you never got along with this person to begin with, then he'll yea report her. She ain't your friend. . . \n\nIf your other friends get upset, then it's time to find new friends. What she did wasn't a mistake. Your name was on the card. She could have been a friend and just said \"oh you dropped this. I don't want someone to find it and rack up your account\" but she didn't. She was that person.", "Go to the police she didn't just \"find\" the card and even if she did it has your name on it I would imagine, there's no universe where she wasn't doing this purposefully and maliciously. Your friends being ridiculous and enabling a thief.", "NTA. File a police report ASAP!", "NTA. Press charges. Right. Fucking. Now. She stole your credit card and then spent a shitload of money on it. Even if she does say she\u2019ll oh you back, press charges. You are responsible for that money if you don\u2019t get moving on the crime that has taken place. I\u2019m confused as to how you haven\u2019t taken such action. These people are showing they aren\u2019t your friends if they are siding with the known thief.

They know what your regular habits are, and if it deviated from that pattern, they should have done something.  This is why I think that you will need to make the police report if you are wanting to dispute the charges.  Otherwise you are silently agreeing that those were your purchases by not taking action.  They are going to stick it to you for those charges.", "Especially at a store with 5k jackets.   There should be security video if OP acts fast.", "Duh. Yeah", "Oh I agree that OP should make a police report because that\u2019s going to cover her ass in any circumstance but a lot of credit card companies dgaf what your purchases look like unless you\u2019re suddenly spending money in a foreign country/hundreds of miles away from home or withdrawing huge amounts of cash."]}
