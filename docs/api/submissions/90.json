Your pregnancy, your body, your decision. You probably have to accept that the family will be upset by this, but you aren\u2019t wrong for choosing not to tell them. Are you planning to keep it a secret until after you have given birth?", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe anyone information about your pregnancy.", "NTA.\nI'd be so  tempted to not just not tell any family members on either side until your proposed two weeks after, but then when they ask why you didn't tell them you were pregnant, claim that you weren't: \"We found her under a cabbage leaf!  I know, we always thought that was an old wive's tale, too!\" or \"There was this big white bird flying around, and he seemed to be carrying something in his beak, and then he dropped off the cutest little baby! Of course we kept baby n!\"...", "Definitely NTA. Like others have said, your body, your choice, your baby etc. They'll get upset but that's on them for behaving awfully the first time.", "NTA. Your extended family has no right of knowledge. They lost any favors they might have been granted by their behavior last time.", "hmm im not sure how long you could get away with hiding it. If it means not seeing any of them for nine months, I wonder if that alone wouldn\u2019t cause a new issue (and thus unnecessary stress) for you and your husband. I guess it would depend on the relationship you have with them. Further, I think it might create a lot of conflict once you eventually give birth; they may very well feel betrayed. It might be much more important to have a sit down with them and tell them honestly how it had made you both feel last time, and set your boundaries once and for all, so that you can still keep them in the loop without them invading your privacy or causing you unwanted pain", "NTA - Just because they are related to you does not mean they need to know all of your business; especially if they complicate the situation by knowing. Do what's best for you, your husband, and child.", "NTA\n\nAt the best of times, a lot of people wait 12 weeks as the vast majority of miscarriages happen within the first 12 weeks. but after what you've  been through, you've got double the reason not to say.", "NTA. It's your pregnancy and your child - you can handle announcing either one, or not announcing at all, any way you like. You don't need stress or drama.", "NTA - This is your baby, so prepare in whatever way makes you comfortable.", "Your health, your life, your baby. You do what you feel is necessary to stay safe and healthy. NTA and I would consider going LC/NC until babe is born (if not longer).\n\nNTA", "NTA, your body, your baby, your choice if hubby is cool with it", "NTA - If you don't trust people with secrets, don't tell them secrets.", "NTA - you can tell whomever whenever you\u2019re comfortable.", "Of course you wouldn't be the AH. It's your pregnancy and it's not as though you're hiding it from your husband. You're all clear.\nNTA", "NTA, your body, your choice. I do wonder if even telling one person each might be too many, though, considering how they\u2019ve behaved in the past? Either way, NTA! And congrats on your growing family, OP.", "NTA at all. Not even a little bit. This is your baby and your pregnancy. As fat as the gender and name, they can find out after the baby is born. \n\nYou are allowed to keep the pregnancy to yourselves as long as you want. For my 1st baby we announced it at about 10 weeks. My 2nd baby was a miscarriage. For my 3rd baby, we waited three months before telling anyone. The only other person who knew was one of my cousins.", "First of all congratulations! \n\nDefinately NTA. After all the problems surrounding you during the first pregnancy you both are doing the smart thing to keep a lid on it.

I wanted to spend the last weeks calmly.\n\nUnfortunately, my father decided to add over two weeks to the almost two weeks I had already given. He wanted my baby to be born on his wedding anniversary with his third wife. I told him that was not happening, he told me to wait and see. \n\nBaby came a week before the actual due date, which made everyone my father told think the baby was premature. Father and his wife were incensed I had lied. No way a seven-pound-plus baby who went home two days later was a premie. \n\nOP, I would not tell anyone because it is hard to keep the secret. Enjoy your secret pregnancy.\n\nNTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. Theres no reason to tell family members about a pregnancy. Every cousin that's had a kid hasn't told the whole family. Most of the time I found out from FB. Personally it doesn't bother me that they didn't tell me. I don't view pregnancy as a big deal. Tell who you want and tell the other to kick rocks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Being pregnant is hard enough physically and emotionally.  You don't need that type of family drama to add more stress.\n\nGoing LC / NC in this situation is perfectly understandable.

If you felt like it, you could deliberately play dumb when anyone asks about the bump, or claim you have a cyst/gastro issues, then after the birth say 'hey, guess what?'.

If you can accept that they will be angry and you feel it is worth it to help the actual pregnancy be less stressful then it\u2019s fair enough, but you should prepare yourselves for some fall out. I think you should prepare the announcement very carefully and consider your wording. Good luck and I hope it all goes well.", "Ahh thats good info to know!!
