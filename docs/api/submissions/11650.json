Your baby... Your choice of names. If she doesn't like it... Tell her she doesn't have to come around. A lot of people don't like other peoples names, but guess what? Its not their name so they really shouldn't care.", "NTA. Leon is probably a jerk ex, not a relative.", "NTA. She can use your son's proper name, she's being childish by making a thing out of it and completely disrespectful. So she doesn't like one person with the same name, why should that have anything to do with your son? Ridiculous.\n\n\nMy sister has dealt with this. She thought she would avoid objection about their name choice with their first child by waiting until the baby was born to tell people the name. Siblings (me) and parents came to visit at the same time in the hospital and she announced the name- her in laws made it VERY clear that they hated the name. It was SO rude and uncomfortable. For the first year they tried calling the baby other names, until their son put his foot down and said \"accept her real name and call her by that or you're going to lose the privilege of seeing her\". That might sound harsh to some, but it sure worked.", "NTA- In fact, you\u2019re the best for naming your kid Leon cause there\u2019s a supercool videogame charcater named Leon and your child will thank you later, if they get into videogames.", "Nta plenty of people have names that also belong to other humans.

It is never anyone else's say in what the baby is named.", "NTA. \n\nThe only people whose opinions matter when naming a child are the child\u2019s parents. Unless you\u2019re a member of the British Royal Family, which I presume you are not. \n\nRemind your mum that in the same way a nasty person can give you a bad association with a name, a lovely person can create a good association with it. I can\u2019t imagine a grandson creating anything other than a good association. Case in point- I used to know someone called Eleanor, we didn\u2019t get on (in retrospect just as much my fault as hers!) and consequently I disliked the name. Then I joined my current job and I have a colleague called Eleanor. My colleague is amazing- good at her job, friendly, has taught me so much and made me a better person. I really respect and like her. As a consequence the name Eleanor is now a positive one for me. Your mum will get the same way about Leon.", "NTA only the parents of the baby get a say in names.

Maybe she can see it as a rewriting of what the name \u201cLeon\u201d means to her. However she deals with it, she needs to honor your request. Decreased access to baby Leon would be a perfectly reasonable consequence to communicate and enforce if she doesn\u2019t.", "NTA, he's your child so long as the child's parents agree that's all that matters.\n\nAnd good job with going for a name that isnt used much anymore but isn't a weird name. My name is one of those that my mother thought was great but has plagued me my whole life. When naming my daughter I made sure to do it exactly like you.\n\nNow that being said I don't think it's a problem that your mom wants to use a nickname. I suggested my daughter's name and I rarely call her by her name. I usually use a nickname that is formed using the first letter of her first and middle names, or one that I use one that I chose for her.", "nta.  my cousins husband is named leon and hes one of my favorite people on that side of the family. your mom needs to get over herself", "NTA.

She really does need to get over it but having a cute nickname for your baby is also harmless so long as it doesn't interfere with him learning what his given name is.  His name is Leon, nickname Leo or something like that.  Trying to assign a nickname without actually knowing the child's personality beforehand is kinda tricky.

You did not name Leon after him, and she gets the gift of having a wonderful grandson to create new memories associated with the name. Does she not realize that? NTA.

That made me grow up resenting that uncle. I'm still feeling guilty for having been almost happy about it when he died in his forties. I was still a kid back then, around 10 years old I think. It feels really stupid and shameful now but there's nothing I can do about it any more. I know this is just a single anecdote and there might have been just something wrong with me. I just wanted to say that it's not necessarily safe to assume it would be harmless.", "...unless the child eventually chooses to change it.", "The likelihood of hating your own nickname assigned to you by whoever is just as possible as hating your own name given to you at birth.  Relatively speaking, it is harmless", "That's true, it might just as well be the other way around. I guess what I'm thinking here is that if OP's mom won't respect OP's choice of name, will she respect what the kid feels about it when he is able to express his own view?", "That is a whole issue in of itself.  Boundaries are a definite must.  The fact that GMA already believes she has a right to have a say is disturbing.  So many grandparents believe they have more say than the parents when it comes to how the child should be raised then get all picachu faced when they get banned from seeing the child.  Like, seriously, what did they think would happen?"]}
