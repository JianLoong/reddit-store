So Cheyenne prefers Chey but will answer to anything that sounds like her name or similar unless it is a group like class etc where she would have no clue. I get very upset that she will put Chey on choir programs, play programs, papers etc. I did not name her Chey but in the end she likes what she likes and responds to what she responds to\u2026. She also knows mom will only call her Cheyenne if using her name.  The moral is the your mother can call your child sweetie, honey, baby, Lee whatever you approve her to do\u2026 and from there your child will decide what they like and because it is their name is that not their choice?

But we weren't forceful, didn't get mad when they ended up with a middle name none of us had even thought of before, because SHE ISN'T OUR BABY!!! We don't have naming rights to her.
