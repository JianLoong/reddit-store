But now I'm back to work, I take care of our son the 100% of the time and I also worry about cleaning, washing, cooking, etc. I tried to talk to him, but he always has an excuse and thinks he is the only one with the right to rest. So he comes from work to watch TV or play video games. I told him that since I take 100% care of our son and home, from now on he would take care of 100% of the bills, rent, electricity, grocery shopping, etc. He started an argument because I was charging him to \"take care of our son\" and that's not \"what a good mother does\"  IATA for wanting him to take over monetarily since he does not do so in other areas?\n\n\nsome clarification\nThe initial agreement we reached when I was pregnant was that parenting would be 50/50. that household chores and chores with our son would be divided as much as possible\n\nWe have talked about this a lot, but the change only lasts a couple of days, the ultimatum of paying the bills was born for him to wake up.

Your hubby seems to be under the impression that because you now work from home, you obviously have time to take care of the house. Which is such an idiotic take on his part. In response to the \"charging him to take care of your son\" and \"that's not what a good mother does\" my response is, \"no, I'm entrusting the necessities our son needs to you, that is keeping a roof over his head, hot water for baths, and food in his belly, while I tend to and provide for his daily needs, his well-being, and maintaining a safe environment for him. Like a good mother does. Unless you don't think that tending to our son's daily needs, his well-being, and maintaining a safe environment for him is what a good mother does that is.\"", "NTA. \n\nYou're not \"charging him\" - you're responding to his expectation for a traditional division of childcare/housework (100% you) by asking for a similiarly traditional division in financial responsibility. \n\nThe other alternative would be to redirect money from your job towards paying for a cleaner / babysitter to cover the hours he doesn't contribute to these tasks.", "NTA sounds like one of those guys that want a \"traditional\" marriage. But still wants you to work full time. Tell him expecting the mother of his child to support him is not what a good husband does - he's obviously a poor example of a man. Keep your finances separate and do not contribute a dime until he steps up - he sucks.", "NTA. You gave him a fair choice: help with household chores or pay all the bills. You can give him another choice: help with the household chores or I quit my job so I have time for the baby and the household chores because there is not enough time in a day for someone to take care of a baby, work from home, do household chores AND stay healthy. Another choice you can give him: start helping with the household chores or we need to go to couples therapy so a third party impartial observer can tell you how abusive your current behavior is.", "NTA, tell him 50/50on bills means you go 50/50 on house work", "NTA you both need to hire a baby sitter and have a sit-down adult conversation about how money and responsibleness are going to be split going forward.

Both of you need a much better life plan. Flash news to you, your baby will not be 5m forever. Yes, you deserve an even partnership with your husband or get out.", "NTA. I understand your frustration but you need to really sit him down and have an adult conversation. Working from home and looking after your son is  more than enough work on its own. I understand he can be tired too, but as a father myself it is also my responsibility to help with chores and child", "NTA - wish my partner offered me a cash option to get out of nappies, mopping, cooking, washing, gardening, etc.\n\nBut on a serious note - don\u2019t let them get comfortable doing nothing or you have to fight to get back to square one \u2026", "HUGE NTA- we went through something similar. Both wfh and had a newborn. Wife went on mat leave and I paid all the bills, she used her money for baby/ herself etc. but it didn\u2019t stop there I\u2019ll be honest it took me some time to realize this wasn\u2019t enough and I started picking up the chores dishes, cleaning toys, doing my own laundry (she didn\u2019t want me ruining the baby\u2019s clothes lol) getting groceries etc making daughter breakfast/lunch dinner (not all the time but I do). as much as I could to help. I\u2019ll tell you right now, he needs a kick in the pants. Where tf is his priorities? \n\nHe\u2019s selfish and clearly if he just comes home to game when does he spend time with the baby? This is where boys who get married and become fathers believe they shouldn\u2019t lift a finger.. maybe that\u2019s how it was. Yes he should pay all the bills but still help around the house. You sacrifice the free time you have because it\u2019s the right thing to do for your family. I bet he\u2019s miserable because you don\u2019t have s3x much anymore either.. I wonder why. \n\nI\u2019m no saint but I do understand my wife is equal to me and has emotions and feelings too.
