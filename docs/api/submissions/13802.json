If I had the option and experience that I have now, I would have avoided student loans as much as was possible for me at the time. \n\nMy other thought was that maybe you could spend your first year or two at the local, less expensive, college to get your general courses completed and then transfer to your dream college for the remaining years? \n\nAnyway you slice it, you're NTA as you're the one taking on the risk and it is your life to live.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
