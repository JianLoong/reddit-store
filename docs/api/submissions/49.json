Oh yeah, I would always \"assume\" something a roommate leaves unopened and wrapped in a brown paper bag and doesn't offer to me was for me. LOL. Your roommate is really bad at both self-control and coming up with believable excuses.", "NTA.

She should replace it.", "She stole your candy. Replacing it is the least she could do.\n\nNo, NTA.", "NTA. A huge stockpile of candy in the week before Halloween..? That's pretty obvious.", "NTA but don't leave it in the kitchen next year.", "NTA\nIt's funny how, during the entire week while your roommates were demolishing the two bags of candy you bought \"for the people living in the apartment\", they never thanked you for your generosity, ate a bunch of it in front of you or asked to check their assumption of who it was for...", "NTA. It was never hers to eat without permission.  She should pay up.", "NTA \n\nThey stole your candy.   They owe you the bucks.", "OP, I am truly sorry to hear that your room mate had to ruin Halloween by eating what is not hers. So straight NTA and she needs to pay up or buy new candies to replace the ones she shouldn't have eaten", "[deleted]", "NTA. If the bag was opened by the roommate who you allowed to have a few and you usually share food in the apartment, I can understand confusion about whether it was okay to eat some. Still, no one should think they are entitled to 3/4 of something they didn't even pitch in for and it would be fair to ask that they replace one of those bags even without the \"this was for my class\" factor. It isn't your responsibility to pay for or run around town to find treats for your adult roommates.\n\nMaybe you should have marked the paper bag to avoid confusion, but it's a perfectly reasonable request.", "NTA\n\nHad you poured the candy into a bowl and left it out on the counter in the kitchen - sure.  She would have been correct in assuming you left candy out for the apartment.\n\nBut it was IN A BAG.  Not unpacking something is generally a safe context clue that it is packed up to go someplace else.  Not her stomach.  Why was she even snooping in the bag??", "NTA, but you also probably shouldn\u2019t have left the candy sitting out in a communal area without at least some kind of note on it that said \u201cdon\u2019t touch, for the kiddos.\u201d Roommate(s) should definitely replace the candy.", "NTA. Shouldn't leave it out though.", "Definitely NTA unless you have an open food policy. Meaning you all share the food normally. If that is the case N A H.", "NAH. If you told one he could have some, it would be assumed the other could. Unless you have an arrangement where no one eats anyone else\u2019s food. Then she would be the AH. You could have left a note on the bag saying not to eat any because it was for your students.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
