We started from scratch and have worked so hard to get to where we\u2019re at now. We\u2019re not rich but we hate asking others for help so we as a couple decided to work hard for the things we want. \nAs for me and my MIL we\u2019ve never had a relationship ever. She never seems interested in me as a person and has never given me the respect as the mother of her grandchildren or the wife of her son. She never greets me even when she comes to my home. When we gather I feel left out of conversations and she\u2019s never once asked me how I am doing or small talk about work or anything that has to do with me. \nShe constantly pops up unannounced. One time after work my SIL asks for her 2 sons to sleepover our house because it was one of her son\u2019s birthdays and this was his birthday wish, which we agreed to. An hour later my SIL pulls into our driveway, my husband goes to greet them at the car;4 of my husband\u2019s nephews come barging in, then my MIL comes through the door holding another infant, my husband is trailing behind her holding his OTHER INFANT niece! At this point I am extremely confused and baffled and don\u2019t know what to make of it. I now have an entire kindergarten in my house. My SIL never gets out of the car then proceeds to drive off and apparently my husband is equally confused.  I make up the quickest excuse to leave out of the house. Turns out my SIL went out to buy her son a cake and wanted to celebrate in our house without ever telling us!\nI\u2019ve started to realize that my MIL and SIL\u2019s often guilt my husband into hosting certain events in our home like birthdays and holidays. In the past my husband has hosted such events but never admits who\u2019s idea it was. I recently started witnessing these persistent suggestions for myself from my SIL\u2019s. \nWe threw our daughter a birthday party recently in our basement. A few weeks later I overhear my husband speaking on the phone with his mom. Based on his responses I know she\u2019s asking him for something. After the phone call he proceeds to tell me that she wants to throw her grandson a party at our house. \nI am very cautious about who I let in our home. It is our sanctuary and safe haven and I especially want to keep it this way for our children. I try to be very careful as to who I let in my home. My priority is my kid\u2019s safety and well being. With such a request to allow someone else to throw a party in our home it takes away the ability of whom we will allow and who exactly will be invited because we are not the ones inviting them. \nMy husband and I talked it over and agreed that we won\u2019t allow this. I am growing so tired of being volunteered unwillingly to host events and I\u2019m sick of the entitlement people think they have over my family and I! We are one unit and I need to be included in these conversations. My SIL lives in my MIL\u2019s basement which has the same amount of space as ours but no events are ever hosted there. I suggested the party be in my MIL\u2019s basement for once.

Your MIL is acting like she has more of a right to *your home* than you do, like you're a total nonentity. You don't even need a \"good reason\" to say no: it's *your* home, and you have a right to decide *your* boundaries. Her behavior is disrespectful and completely unacceptable.", "NTA, but your MIL obviously is one and your husband sheepishly let her trample over all your boundaries and treat you like you don't exist all those years, unf***ingbelievable.", "NTA in the least. Your MIL and SIL were out of line in every possible way. Someone owes you a huge apology, but don't hold your breath about getting it.", "NTA\n\nYour home your rules.", "NTA. It's a two for one special: she/they treat your home as their events plaza (gonna go out on a limb and assume they either don't help prep or clean up, or make only a token effort, which is worse if true); she/they also don't even respect you enough to convince you and just let your hubby do their dirty work.\n\nGood to see he's learning at least. Coming to you and admitting she wants to host at yours and letting you have input in the decision is so much better than letting himself be manipulated, agreeing, and then trying to 'con' you that it's his idea and his will to save face. He deserves credit there, that's a hard step to take when you come up with an overbearing parent. As do you, since you obviously make him feel safe enough to do that.\n\nMaybe build on that? Agree with him that any time he gets asked (or 'voluntold'), that he should find some excuse to end the call and promise to get back to them (but not to ask you); then, you call back, both of you together, for a \"oh, hubby said you wanted to ask a favour of us?\". Force her to actually ask, acknowledging it's a favour not an expectation. Force her to address you both, not just him. Force her to address any issues with the request (like the mess left after the last one requiring a promise of her handing clean up, or the time not being suitable so she'd have to agree to play babysitter for the duration, or lack of control over guests means a pre-approval on who's coming or no dice). Obviously, you can still say no, even if she jumps through all those hoops, but getting her to realise you and hubby are a unit, and that your space is yours not hers, is another important step that should help hubby's confidence in not getting doormatted by her.", "NTA, it's always amazing to me how some people can be so generous with other people's money and things.", "NTA. Assuming MIL also wants you to clean up after everyone else leaves too right?", "NTA.  It's your home.  Check out r/justnomil for more about handling her cuz she sounds terrible.", "NTA at all.   Hopefully your DH stands up to them", "\"I suggested the party be in my MIL\u2019s basement for once.\"\n\nLast things first, absolutely NTA for asking someone else to host. Especially since they are walking all over your husband and honestly don't deserve the benefit of your kindness from how you have been treated", "NTA.  Your in-laws are awful", "NTA. Don't ever allow this to happen again.", "NTA\n\nIt's ok to have boundaries. You need to get your husband on the same page and he needs to be able to tell the SIL and MIL no. If he and his family are big into being close with extended family or comes from a culture like that him saying no might be hard for him.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They don't want to host because they don't want to have to deal with entertaining the kids, cleaning up, getting house trashed... And they know they can get away with it.
