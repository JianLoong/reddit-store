I say this to him as someone who had lost 85 lbs herself. \nSo for trying to keep your spouse on their track I'll say nta but kinda ta for bringing up failing her weigh ins.", "The way you wrote in the original post reads more like you said \"no, no until you eat nutritious stuff first.\" Like a parent that told their kid they had to eat their veggies or they wouldn't get pudding.", ">I told her to eat the dinner I made first\n\nThat is completely different than what you put in your post.", "Uh-huh. You sound like a real prince who would *never* be so disrespectful. \ud83d\ude44", "hm, kinda agree. Never been morbidly obese, nor actually obese but always was on the chubbier side, causing me to be on a diet a lot. Developing early signs of anorexia then yoyoing back and then ortorexia. Can't say my relationship with food is ever going to be super healthy but I think like with anything there are things we are all missing. Here is my perspective. \n\nPeople being fat shamed are three times more keen to eat because, well, we comfort eat when we are upset and any 'fat shaming' is pretty upsetting. Do you see the circle? Also something rarely talked about killing off items 'permanently' usually leads to obsession and then frustration, regarding those items rather than healthy attitude of 'Do I want to eat it? Will it make me happy?'. It would cause binge eating. Because they have been told 'they can't have it' and then --- basically a whole load of potatoes. \n\nThat being said the husband should not police her. This is because of issues noted above but also potential resentment that this can start. Plus it can be quite abusive. I think husband's role should be there more supportive than that. As in maybe he should join her on her journey (eating habits wise). Rather than punishing behaviours (taking out food) we should talk about rewarding (as in maybe getting a dress  two sizes smaller than she is currently wearing that she would fit in when she looses x amount of weight and put it in a visible spot so she doesn't loose focus). But then praise and don't bring in the cake to the house, cupcake. Maybe something lighter she could eat and share. Or eat that cake outside house. Having her watch you eating something she wants is pretty tough and I get why she would ask.  \n\nI just don't think OP approached this correctly. It is his wife's thing to abide by the 'diet plan' and if it is not working or it is too stringent her dietitian should revisit and rework it so the feeling of being forced to give up her favourite food is less. Because it is the feeling of giving up leads to obsessive behaviour and that ultimately leads to bingeing. Just saying.", "I don't think this post is bullying though.", "Not just a cake.

If she can't say no, and she's not changing her snacking habits, what do you do if not intervene?
