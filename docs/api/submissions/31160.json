Habitually late = habitually rude. It would be one thing if he were usually on time. In that case, I'm guessing you would have waited, supposing that there must be a good reason.

You are being an AH to yourself by feeling bad about the food.  This gives your friend an excuse not to ever take your time seriously.  The only way your friend will learn is if this happens every time from now on and that he misses out on an experience he wants.  Your friend is being very selfish.

Wasting someone\u2019s time equals huge disrespect. Tell him you won\u2019t be able to remain friends if he continues doing this. At the very least he could at least warn you that he will be late.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. It's not only rude to you to be late, but rude to the restaurant.

For me, the one thing you can really never get back is time.  You can make more money, you can replace things, but with time once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.

She then apparently complained to my son who said, well, I told you, don\u2019t be late.  Mom waited 15 minutes and that is a lot longer than she normally does.

They just showed up late? No text even? \n\nNTA, they are TA. Hell, I call in late if I suspect I'm going to be late just in case. Usually show up on time or less than 5 mins. late.

Your friend is rude as.\n\nMy take on it is this: as a relatively healthy, gainfully employed human in a 1st world country, I live a life filled with infinite resources. I'm very fortunate.\n\nFor example, I have an endless capacity to give and receive love. I can make new friends. I can make more money. \n\nThe only resource that is finite is my time. \n\nThe clock ticks for all of us. When it runs out, it's over. There's no begging or buying more.\n\nSo I guard it zealously, and try to use it wisely. I respect other peoples time, and I don't give my time to people who squander it. \n\nThat doesn't mean I work 24/7 or hustle myself to death lol. I relax, waste time, have fun. But I choose how I spend my time. I certainly don't waste it waiting around for someone who doesn't think my time matters. Because in my eyes, that means on some level, they don't think I matter. \n\nAnd before anyone comes at me, I know ND people exist and some of them struggle with this. Those people in my life, I give then grace and we work on strategies together. That's different.
