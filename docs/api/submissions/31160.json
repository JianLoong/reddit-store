Habitually late = habitually rude. It would be one thing if he were usually on time. In that case, I'm guessing you would have waited, supposing that there must be a good reason. In his case, you know it's just another example of his middle finger being given to you on repeat every minute he's late. He just cares about his own time. Not yours.", "NTA.  You are being an AH to yourself by feeling bad about the food.  This gives your friend an excuse not to ever take your time seriously.  The only way your friend will learn is if this happens every time from now on and that he misses out on an experience he wants.  Your friend is being very selfish.  It's not up to you to always bow down to your friend's selfishness with being always late.  Your time is a perishable commodity and can't get back when used.", "NTA. \"You want to know what's actually annoying? I've been sitting here by myself waiting for you for 30 min already.\"", "He was 30 minutes late. Didn\u2019t call or text with a reason. Even if it was dumb it would\u2019ve been much more respectful and responsible to do that. You are a good friend for even putting up with this behavior. He needs a reality check. Wasting someone\u2019s time equals huge disrespect. Tell him you won\u2019t be able to remain friends if he continues doing this. At the very least he could at least warn you that he will be late.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. It's not only rude to you to be late, but rude to the restaurant. They only have the table booked for so long. I'd reconsider dining with your friend in a place that requires reservations because he's already demonstrated that this doesn't work for him.", "NTA.  For me, the one thing you can really never get back is time.  You can make more money, you can replace things, but with time once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.  And communication can go a long way.  Let me know and I will adjust to accommodate, but to just show up 30 minutes late, just no.", "NTA  \n\n\nFriend picked the time and scheduled for 8. You were there at 8. \n\nWhy should he be surprised that you started eating when he shows up half an hour late? \n\nIf you had been that late also, neither of you would have gotten the reservation, they'd have cancelled that shit on you.\n\nThe late friend is the rude one and the asshole, and they need to stop wasting your time.", "NTA. Most restaurants won't hold a table for that long. Most restaurants don't sit people until everyone is present. Your friend is a JERK.", "NTA. This is the right way to deal with people, who repeatedly waste your time by being late. It is annoying, though, to have to sit and eat alone when you were expecting to enjoy your meal together.", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly, you were lucky you were sat and didn't lose your reservation.", "NTA\nWhen the reservation is for 8 and you show up 30 minutes late without the courtesy of a phone call I can\u2019t understand what you have to be upset about. If you continue to dine with him in the future, this is the way to go. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to give a whole ass adult a fake time (invite him for 7 when the reservation is for 8).", "Them being late that much for nothing other than poor time management means they don't value your time. This isn't so bad with being a little late to a party or something, but a 1 on 1 dinner with a reservation, did they expect you to sit on your hands for 30 minutes? NTA", "Nta *he* chose the time.  I don't wait for those who are perpetually late.  You know what time the event starts, you aren't the center of the world.\n\nOfc when someone texts me and says, 'running late' I will wait.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did you finish eating soon after his arrival and immediately bail cutting the dinner plan short? Nothing about you starting your meal changed the intended outcome of the evening - you two spending an evening together. I don't really understand why people get uppity about starting their meals if it's amongst close friends/family. It might be nicer overall to eat together but at the end of the day what difference does it make apart from you not being hungry and cranky when he arrives?", "NTA maybe next time he won\u2019t be late!", "In the future if you value his friendship, set up the reservation an hour ahead. This way the dude will probably be right on time. That is probably, lol", "30 minutes late? NTA", "NTA, but since he would have made the reservation for 2, I'm shocked this restaurant chose to seat you before your entire party had arrived.", "While I would usually say a phone works 2 ways, you could have called(imagine if something had actually happened) NTA - he is the one who wanted to do this.", "[deleted]", "You friend has the audacity to arrive late and ask why you're eating. Eff that friend in the face.", "Why would you feel bad? Your friend is a self absorbed person who has no regard for anyone but himself. Habitually late people just don\u2019t care enough about others to change their ways. They justify it by saying it\u2019s no big deal and they\u2019re here now so what\u2019s the problem? Having to adjust plans to accommodate these people is a pain so stop waiting around for this jerk and do what you want to do when you want to on your time, not his.", "Book a dinner cruise that leaves the dock on time. NTA", "NTA, but I think I'd just stop eating out with that person.", "NTA\n\nI am very interested in the fact that I dont see anyone saying YTA... I mean you are not, but the number of people around me that are late for everything suggests that I am wrong. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen leaving for an event. We would all meet at one location to make sure we had all equipment, sometimes people would carpool so would drop off their kids so they could ride with others. It is amazing how many parents say we are wrong for leaving before they dropped off their child. Like listen lady, we left 15 minutes late, an HOUR ago.", "I have a friend who is always late,  at least 20 to 30 minutes. Drive me nuts.I was always telling her that I was going to order my meal if she was late again. I finally did it, and she was really surprised when she finally showed up. She's never been more than 5 minutes late since.", "That\u2019s kind of how I felt when I said, \u201cf*k it, I\u2019m just starting my dinner without him. Dinner started at 8 dude. You want to eat dinner with me, get there at 8.\u201d \n\nBut afterwards I felt a bit petty..", "I was concerned about the restaurant getting annoyed, too! It\u2019s a new spot and reservation are booked solid. I didn\u2019t want someone else to be held up because we started our meals late! \n\nDefinitely no more reservations-required spots! Lol. I hoped maybe having that time requirement would make him on time\u2026nope.", "I\u2019m learning that thanks to this post! I don\u2019t usually eat at reservation-only places! And this place probably won\u2019t be reservation-only in a few more months, it\u2019s just new so everyone is flocking to it! Lol. I didn\u2019t realize that many won\u2019t seat just 1 of 2 people! \n\nMan, I\u2019d be so pissed (at my friend) if I had gotten dressed up, drove 30 minutes across town, waited 30+ minutes, and then couldn\u2019t eat because he can\u2019t get his ass somewhere on time!", "I get where you\u2019re coming from, but I don\u2019t want to play those games, know what I mean? We\u2019re adults. He picked the reservation day and time, I shouldn\u2019t have to trick him into being on time.", "Could you please explain why the friend was annoyed? I honestly don\u2019t understand. Was OP supposed to wait indefinitely to order? Why does the friend get to be late, not call and be annoyed?", "Why should OP have to adjust their time to match someone who is too rude to show up on time and doesn't even bother calling or texting to let them know? 'Friend' has zero reason to complain or be annoyed. NTA", "I think that's the only way some of these people wake up to themselves. Luckily your friend realized she was the problem.", "I had a friend who was always 20 to 30 minutes late for everything and for years I just dealt with it. Then she got a boss who started writing her up every time she was late and she got put on probation. Now she's rarely more than 5 minutes late.", "You're right. You shouldn't have to play those games. Just tell him the truth. That him being habitually late is him being rude every time he does it. You are not going to put up with it anymore and while you would wait for someone else you won't wait for him. He's used up all benefit of the doubt. Now him being late just means he didn't take care to be on time. Okay. You no longer care to wait."]}
