It\u2019s usually the same people who go every year give or take a few. It is: My husband and I with our 2 kids, his sister and husband with their 3 kids, his younger brother and his daughter, his mom and dad, grandma, usually an aunt and uncle and maybe a cousin or 2. Not to mention his brother in-laws parents and maybe a sibling come too. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m this type of person because I don\u2019t judge anybody on their house size or their wealth, but the issue is that his sisters house is so fucking tiny it\u2019s uncomfortable for everyone there. It actually isn\u2019t even an individual house but it is half of a duplex type. There will be about 20 people coming this year and I just think it\u2019s ridiculous for her to insist on hosting. They also have a large Great Dane that is on top of everyone, well actually everyone is on top of everyone. I shit you not that half of the guests have to sit on the living room floor to eat. Usually the older relatives sit at the 4 person dining table, a few people sit on the couch, and the rest of us are standing or sitting on the floor with our plates of food. OH, and the last big kicker is that there is only ONE bathroom that constantly smells like shit. \n\nMy kids always complain about going to this aunts house because of the reasons I listed. I am siding with them and I said I would talk to dad about us volunteering to host. We don\u2019t live in a mansion but we can comfortably fit all the guests and we have more than 1 bathroom. \n\nHusband doesn\u2019t want to because he says it will hurt his sisters feelings and she already knows how poor they are and this would be rubbing it in her face.

You have valid points, his sister's place sounds like a really bad place to host 20 people for a holiday get-together.  But your husband is probably also right, his sister's feelings would be hurt by it.  Like a lot of poor people she's probably proud of what little she does have and prickly about what she feels like is \"charity\".  It's a tricky situation to navigate.  NAH.", "NAH really, have you considered letting your SiL host the event at your house? I know that sounds kinda weird but it might be the best solution, she gets to plan the meal and everything and everyone else gets more square feet.", "YTA. Instead of dismissing your SIL as being inadequate to host, why don't you offer to bring over a folding table and some chairs? You can help to make her house more comfortable.", "These Y T A comments astound me. You're not judging your SIL for her being \"poor\". This is a space issue. I lived in a half duplex for 20 years. And the most people I'd invite over for any holiday or event was 8. Why? Because my kitchen had 4 chairs around a table, I had a couch, love seat, and recliner in the living room, and 1 and 1/2 bath.  The thought of requiring my GUESTS, family or friends, to have no where to sit and no where to set their plate down to eat is ludicrous to me, and that's even without the gigantic dog for them to trip over. Yeah, I've seen a few \"why don't you bring a folding table and chairs, dur, dur, dur\" and I'm still thinking.....and put them Where? It's a duplex, not a TARDIS and it's not bigger on the inside that it looks. I personally feel you're NTA. You're not going to be comfortable, even your kids have said they don't want to go there. Tell her the two of you can co host the event, she can plan everything, you'll provide the space. If she refuses, next year plan to go away for the holiday and make that your new tradition.", "INFO:\nDoes the sister genuinely enjoy hosting? \n\nI could see that being incredibly stressful in a tight space.", "NTA if you kindly offer to let her host at your house so she has more space.\n\nYTA if you insist on hosting and insult her home or living situation.\n\nIf she likes and looks forward to hosting then you could also volunteer to bring over some folding chairs or TV trays and unobtrusively slip some poo-pourri into the bathroom.", "I think NAH. We have a large family and many don\u2019t have the space to host holidays. Everyone knows that and we move on and the people that are willing to have 40 people in their house for a holiday invite people. Surely your SIL knows that that 20 people is a tight squeeze in her home? I also want to say that the size of her house doesn\u2019t necessarily say anything about her wealth. We lived in a house for many years that was smaller than we could afford because we liked the location, house, and didn\u2019t see a need to move. There is nothing wrong with her home at all, just might not accommodate 20 very well.", "NTA and I think everyone saying Y T A is either holier than though or 15 / a student used to dorm parties. How does everyone else feel about the sitting on the floor situation? Are the other families loving the casual party style or secretly wishing you would host? And if sister is actually poor would she not rather have someone else pay for all the food you need for 20ppl? Why don't you host Christmas when there's a sit down meal and she hosts a drinks thing for new years eve or the 26th?", "NTA. Idk why so many people think it\u2019s rude for you to want to host for a better experience for everyone.", "What you should do is talk to your sister in law and ask her what her feelings are on the matter, seeing as it's her space and event you're talking about. Ex: \"I know it gets pretty crowded in your house, is hosting something you enjoy doing? If you feel obligated because it's tradition and it's not because you enjoy doing it, we'll be glad to have it at our place. Just let me know if you ever get sick of it and if you ever need anything, I'm always here.\" No tone, no judgy attitude about it, your SIL feels and is supported rather than judged, and the idea is out there; so if she ever says \"enough of this\" she knows she can go to you. \n\nAnd if you can't do that because you don't talk to your SIL, then it's time you do because you marry the family when you marry the spouse. \n\n(Whatever you do, DO NOT bring up the fact your kids complain. Don't do it. That kind of manipulation will backfire on you completely, I watched an extended family member do that and it caused a year of family drama.)", "NAH for bringing it up to your husband. That's absolutely fair game. I don't blame you for not wanting that situation.\n\nBut I think you need to accept what decision your husband comes to. It's his family and if he wants to broach the issue with his sister that is fine, but if he doesn't it's not your place to step in and decide how the family should handle things.", "NAH. The sister\u2019s doing her share by offering to host, even though her place isn\u2019t really big enough. She hasn\u2019t left anyone out and sounds like she\u2019s doing her best. \nOn the other hand, it\u2019s Christmas and you and your kids obviously want to be comfortable and not eat your food whilst sat on the floor with a dog climbing over you. But if you insisted on hosting instead, I think it\u2019d be rude. Is there a way you can compromise? For example taking a camping table or suggesting a walk after dinner (so you\u2019re not all cramped up together but still spending time together) and then heading home after? Or have a separate, second \u201cChristmas Day\u201d with your kids when you get back home.", "NAH i get your husbands point, but you have an even stronger point. You just have to present it with the right angle. The family is growing and has become full of kids, so more space could be better for the dynamic of the party.", "NTA. You're not trying to shame her for her finances but your SIL doesn't sound like she's able to adequately host. Your kids and complaining and guests have to sit on the floor and fend off a great dane for the holidays?\n\n20+ people shouldn't be strongarmed into putting up with all of that just to spare your SIL's feelings. Especially when viable alternatives exist.", "It\u2019s rude to ask your guests to eat on the floor, even without a giant dog around. NTA", "NTA and all of you saying otherwise, you go sit on the floor of someone's tiny house and smell their stinky bathroom and see how fast you change your mind. Nevermind the fact that it's also a fire hazard and 20 people using 1 bathroom? Get real. The sister SHOULD be thinking about her guests comfort over being upset that she can't host...", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t want to spend Christmas stuffed into a small house with 20 people and have to eat on the floor. Plus there\u2019s only 1 bathroom between all 20 people? That\u2019s a recipe for disaster \n\nIf you and your kids don\u2019t enjoy it you are perfectly within your rights to not go. Her feelings might be hurt but honestly she has to know that her house is not good for hosting such a large group. There are other options (like your house!) so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s her house or nothing. \n\nThe main thing to me is that your kids are complaining about the situation. They deserve to enjoy themselves on Christmas and they won\u2019t if you/your husband make them go to their aunts house. Your husband should be more concerned with his children\u2019s feelings than his sisters", "NAH. A good way to maybe word it to the family is to just say, We have more room. You're more than welcome to come in the morning & we'll cook together. So no one's nose gets too out of joint", "NTA.\n\nYour request seems \"unfair\" to your SIL, but it\u2018s actually pretty reasonable and a nice offer. \n\nEspecially because of the bathroom!", "NAH. Heaven forbid you not want to sit on top of your in-laws on the floor while a dog runs around, with 20+ people in a one bathroom house. I feel like the SIL lacks self-awareness here, but I can understand the desire to host.", "NAH I can understand her hurt feelings but I also wouldn\u2019t want to stand to eat or use a bathroom that smells bad.", "NAH\n\nBut it's all going to depend on how you approach this. Can you reach out to SIL directly and offer to host at your place, while involving her in the planning, etc.? So validate that everyone loves getting together, but you know her place is small, the family is growing, and it must be extra work for her. You can move it to your house and have her help plan the food etc. (so she's co-hosting) instead of taking it away from her completely.", "whenever my family had get togethers we usually did it at my house or my uncles house because we had the best ones for family gatherings. NTA", "NTA, I understand they want to create a nice tradition but sounds like their place isn't fit to host so many people, IMO it's a tad rude to offer when you know everyone will be uncomfortable and all their guests will remember is the bad time they had at aunt's place.", "Uh what are these comments? Do y\u2019all seriously want to eat Christmas dinner on the floor? Will there even be space for a card table and chairs? Will that even be enough, or will people have still have to sit on the floor? Will that work with a big dog running around as well?\n\nEveryone is so righteous until they are put in the position. Y\u2019all wouldn\u2019t want to go to this Christmas either and y\u2019all know it.", "NTA. \n\nJust post in the group chat or whatever that sils house is too small and it would not be realistic for her to host 20 people there. That her house just doesn't work for a mainly gathering. \n\nShe is more than welcome to help you host at your house hut you are pushing for the gathering to be at your house. \n\nIf they push back then be honest. Tell her /them they need to get over it because the bathroom always stinks, the house is too little they have no tables and chairs and they have a gross dog. \n\nLogistically her house doesn't work. Its rude to everyone else to force them to go to sols house just because she wants to host. Who cares if she's poor or her feelings get her. Other people shouldn't have a crappy time just so she fells good hosting. \n\nIf I were you I wouod push for hosting the gathering. Sil can host when she has a bigger house.\n\nPeople shouldn't have to sit on the floor with food they have to protect from a huge dog, especially kids. Just to protect your sils feelings. \n\nShe needs to get over it and stop hosting.", "NTA, but perhaps you can suggest a compromise, that you and SIL co-host the event in your home?", "YTA!!!!! \n\nMy house is tiny but my son and I are allergic to dogs, everybody else in my family has dogs. So they asked if we can host Christmas here so my son doesn't have to take his meds. \nIt's a tiny house, one bathroom, but you know what? Your precious butt can bring a folding chair and drive to Walmart to poop in their toilets instead. \n\nSuck it up. It's one gathering.", "Your tone is pretty judgy here so I see why there\u2019s so many Y T A responses but honestly I think NTA for at least offering the larger space. For a major holiday (assuming we\u2019re talking an all-day gathering, not just an hour or two) I think anyone would be frustrated to have to stand the whole time when a space with adequate seating is an option. Kudos to SIL for being willing to host in the space they have, but she may even be relieved that you offered. (Source: I have a small house myself and although I enjoy hosting, it\u2019s realistically not comfortable for large all-day family events. We\u2019ve been there, done that, and it\u2019s so overstimulating to have everybody on top of each other the whole time when we could just go to my parents\u2019 much larger house and actually enjoy the day.)", "NAH\n\nAnyone who says  Y T A is insane and absolutely lacks compassion for those of people who have limited love for cramped, crowded, loud-ass spaces. There's nothing about this gathering that sounds like it would be fun for more than a few minutes. A duplex is far too small for 20 people at one time. But SIL will probably be offended if you move it, and may be one of those people who takes the request to move the event the wrong way. I'd sit it out and send my love and gifts. Because this sounds like absolute hell.", "YWBTA you could suggest co hosting. Have it at your house and she comes to help cook and decorate. Present it as spreading the work load and cost of it between 2 familys.", "Call your Sil. Suggest to Sil that because of the size house you will offer yours but she can be in charge of planning and cooking, with your help of course.", "NTA if you can offer graciously.... \n\nYou could ask if she needs any help in particular... and then offer that she could be in charge of the food but it could be at your house if ever a bit more space and less prep/ cleaning up makes it easier on her.", "Sorry, YWBTA.\n\nIt's their family thing. It's for your husband to bring up and discuss if everyone's actually uncomfortable.\n\nDefinitely doesn't sound like a fun experience though", "It sounds like the only people who have a problem with the normal arrangement is you and your kids.\n\n>I really don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m this type of person because I don\u2019t judge anybody on their house size or their wealth, but the issue is that his sisters house is so fucking tiny it\u2019s uncomfortable for everyone there.\n\nBut you do, and YTA for it.", "My mom comes from a big family. It got to the point where only 2 of the siblings were able to host because of the size of the group.  The thing is the siblings decided on that.  \n\nYou are married into the family.  I know it\u2019s tough because you are family, but don\u2019t mess with their traditions.   \n\nYou could kindly mention (for her next rotation) that you are willing to host if she wants, but take the no.  Just offer to help her. \n\nI\u2019m not judging because I think you are trying to be kind, but how you handle it now that your husband has said back off is where I will judge you.", "NAH, and I like the suggestion of asking her if she\u2019d be interesting in hosting at your house but still in charge of things. If your kitchen is bigger or something, you could pitch it as a \u201cyou may have an easier time\u2026\u201d thing. There are ways to navigate this that are still sensitive to her feelings and enable her to fulfill the tradition.\n\nI will say, however, that if she declines and you persist, refuse to go to her house, or let your kids complain about it in front of her that YWBTA.

Otherwise you may end up excluded from future xmas's.", "NTA. 1 bathroom for 20 people at a food centered holiday? Absolutely not", "NAH but perhaps offer to bring extra tables and chairs so more adults can sit.", "Not the asshole\u2026.

Just come up with another valid reason for wanting to host and leave it at that", "YTA. Their system is to rotate, that seems fair.

It's obvious you aren't being unkind, you just want everyone to enjoy the holiday and be comfortable. I like one posters idea of a combined hosting held at your house.

Who wants to be cramped and having to eat sitting on the floor?? You also cemented this by mentioning the ONE bathroom and it basically smelling like a port-a-potty.

I'd try that option.", "YTA we get it you think you and your home are/is better then them and theirs.

This is a family Christmas party. If there is any meaning at all to Christmas besides being gracious to your family and loved ones, it is remembering that one time when Jesus Christ was born in cramped stable and slept in a manger.

If that\u2019s your attitude, you should check yourself, because there\u2019s no way your SIL can\u2019t see through you.   \n \n\nYou\u2019ve rubbed off on your kids, so I guarantee the adults see through it too. Hell, your own husband didn\u2019t see it as you having a comfort issue, but more of your SIL being poor issue. YTA. Examine why you and your kids are razor focused on the superficial.", "No you don't have to be with the poors you dislike and they don\u2019t get to be around you. Win win", "No, they just mean you don\u2019t go. It\u2019s Christmas and you\u2019re beings a princess. Get over yourself YTA", "r/woosh", "do they want to be with you, a person who is shocked that homes may have only ONE bathroom", "They said you. You don\u2019t have to go. Your husband can go. You don\u2019t have to be uncomfortable in her house. You\u2019re definitely the asshole. Offer a chair get camping chairs you can literally use them for anything. Get a second card table. Like there is ways to have a fun Christmas over bitching it\u2019s too small", "OP, not \"we\" just YOU. Why don't you skip going since you just want to whinge.?", "You\u2019re judging your SIL for a small house. Why not set up a rotation? This year: SIL, next year, your house, the year after - Chinese food buffet like the Christmas story.", "r/woooosh", "That stuff is amazing", "Maybe you enjoy a dog's butthole in your face while you eat, but I'm not a fan lol. And if there's so little space that people have to sit on the floor I doubt that they're too comfortable", "It's so weird to me how this is the takeaway for so many people here- 1 bathroom for 20+ people, a lot eating on the floor with a massive dog can be uncomfortable to anyone. Hosting is a lot of work, and it's not like they have a live-in chef/housekeeper to do all of it, so maybe calm down.\n\n\nI think joint hosting is not a horrible idea, unless you have just decided that OP is a rich person who hates poor people.", "I agree with this, I think everyone is quick to paint OP like a snob, but I was raised lower middle class and could see my mother complaining about these same things, and hating it myself as a teenager.\n\nA lot of this would be annoying to many people, and it doesn't matter how much money you have/how big your house is.", "How many times are people going to piss lmao we would have big gatherings in my  tiny one bedroom house growing up and no one gave a damn as for the dog just ask to put it in a bedroom", "Then they should speak up. They haven't, so OP stands alone in their judgement, and the family should not have to change their traditions for the sake of one person.", "Wow you\u2019ve discovered something no one else knows!! Wow!! \n\nYour technicalities don\u2019t change the fact that Christmas is a celebration of the birth of Jesus.", "Poo Pouri. OP can bring it and leave it in the bathroom and everyone wins.\n\nOP YTA for the reason u/Corpuscular_Ocelot mentioned, that it never occurred to you to think about tables or things you could do to actually help.\n\nAll of my siblings are wealthy and I am very much not.  I wouldn't host in this situation as I'd be too ashamed, but I am very glad my family loves me enough to never make me feel that way.", "It's not comfortable for 20+ people and a great dane. That's not judgment that's physics.", "I grew up poor for half my childhood/ teenage years. As a former poor person, no thanks I don't want to be uncomfortable and it's rude to make your guests be that uncomfortable/ eat on the floor lol. And for OP, it very clearly states that it's not because she's poor, it the lack of seating space and how it's uncomfortable because they're shoving an extreme amount of guests in a tiny space LOL.", "I love the internet for these baseless insinuations.", "It\u2019s the disdain that does it for me. It oozes throughout her entire post. She never mentions anything about her SIL and family, it\u2019s all just flaws about \u201cthat cramped house\u201d and her own husband said it would rubbing it SIL\u2019s face that\u2019s she\u2019s poor and OP doesn\u2019t deny it and says \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t be case\u201d not that that isn\u2019t the case. Then digs deeper and says SIL should want everyone to be comfortable.\u2026.but gives no indication that anyone besides her and her kids are annoyed about going over.", "I grew up on food stamps and was a WIC kid, my parent's grew up poor in Mexico, I would be uncomfortable and annoyed if there was that many people shoved in a tiny area with a giant dog walking around and so would my parents haha. It's def not a money think. Maybe OPs sister has a yard or maybe they can offer their own place, but it seems the sister would be butthurt at the second option by some of OPs responses. You know other people than OP and her kids are probably complaining about the situation as well", "If there are others thinking the same thing as OP, then doesn't it stand to reason that they are also facing the same dilemma OP is facing?\n\nWhich might then discourage them from saying what they want to say?", "I promise you my kids and I are not the only ones that find it uncomfortable.", "It\u2019s literally not though", "That's not physics, that's spoiled western societal norms.", "> this would be rubbing it in her face.\n\nYou would think 20 people is a small house is rubbing everything in everyone's faces....", "OP is very clearly lying out her ass and does look down on SIL for being a poor.", "It's not rude and it\u2019s not a big deal. Grow up and get over it", "She mentioned in other comments that they are not the only ones who are annoyed. \n\nHer post was quite long, if she had to go into the backstory of all of SIL's great attributes, it would have been way too long. She wrote her complaints about this specific situation, and at least personally I can see the annoyance without passing any judgement on SIL. \n\nI get where you're coming from but I think you might have made up that \"disdain\" due to the lack of other info given about SIL. \n\nShe also has said that she will go along with whatever her husband decides.", "Right??\n\nIf they have a yard then a good compromise would be let them host things in Spring and Summer.\n\nI get it's a tricky thing to deal with, and OP can't do much. It really depends on how her husband sees the whole situation.", "Families talk. If enough of them are thinking the same thing, it's going to come out. I just can't believe that the whole family gathers in one place that makes them miserable, and they all grin and bear it. That's not realistic.", "Then why'd you fail to mention it in your original post? Bringing that fact up now just makes it sound like you're making excuses.", "But that\u2019s why it\u2019s celebrated. No one celebrates Christmas because of the pagans or the solstice, they celebrate because of the birth of Jesus. \n\nIf you want to get really real, it\u2019s not celebrated for the pagans or the Christians, it\u2019s a holiday propagated by corporate America to suck resources out of the poor and middle class.", "You're right at some point it will probably come out. But concluding that if it was an issue it would have already came out seems like circular logic. There's always going to be a first time.", "Idk I\u2019m not an expert at AITA"]}
