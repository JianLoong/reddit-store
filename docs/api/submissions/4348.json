It\u2019s usually the same people who go every year give or take a few. It is: My husband and I with our 2 kids, his sister and husband with their 3 kids, his younger brother and his daughter, his mom and dad, grandma, usually an aunt and uncle and maybe a cousin or 2. Not to mention his brother in-laws parents and maybe a sibling come too. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m this type of person because I don\u2019t judge anybody on their house size or their wealth, but the issue is that his sisters house is so fucking tiny it\u2019s uncomfortable for everyone there. It actually isn\u2019t even an individual house but it is half of a duplex type. There will be about 20 people coming this year and I just think it\u2019s ridiculous for her to insist on hosting. They also have a large Great Dane that is on top of everyone, well actually everyone is on top of everyone. I shit you not that half of the guests have to sit on the living room floor to eat. Usually the older relatives sit at the 4 person dining table, a few people sit on the couch, and the rest of us are standing or sitting on the floor with our plates of food. OH, and the last big kicker is that there is only ONE bathroom that constantly smells like shit. \n\nMy kids always complain about going to this aunts house because of the reasons I listed. I am siding with them and I said I would talk to dad about us volunteering to host. We don\u2019t live in a mansion but we can comfortably fit all the guests and we have more than 1 bathroom. \n\nHusband doesn\u2019t want to because he says it will hurt his sisters feelings and she already knows how poor they are and this would be rubbing it in her face. I don\u2019t think that should be the case, I think she should want the family to be comfortable. I\u2019m sure she must know we don\u2019t love sitting on the floor in that cramped house.

You have valid points, his sister's place sounds like a really bad place to host 20 people for a holiday get-together.  But your husband is probably also right, his sister's feelings would be hurt by it.  Like a lot of poor people she's probably proud of what little she does have and prickly about what she feels like is \"charity\".  It's a tricky situation to navigate.  NAH.", "NAH really, have you considered letting your SiL host the event at your house? I know that sounds kinda weird but it might be the best solution, she gets to plan the meal and everything and everyone else gets more square feet.", "YTA. Instead of dismissing your SIL as being inadequate to host, why don't you offer to bring over a folding table and some chairs? You can help to make her house more comfortable.", "These Y T A comments astound me. You're not judging your SIL for her being \"poor\". This is a space issue. I lived in a half duplex for 20 years. And the most people I'd invite over for any holiday or event was 8. Why? Because my kitchen had 4 chairs around a table, I had a couch, love seat, and recliner in the living room, and 1 and 1/2 bath.  The thought of requiring my GUESTS, family or friends, to have no where to sit and no where to set their plate down to eat is ludicrous to me, and that's even without the gigantic dog for them to trip over. Yeah, I've seen a few \"why don't you bring a folding table and chairs, dur, dur, dur\" and I'm still thinking.....and put them Where? It's a duplex, not a TARDIS and it's not bigger on the inside that it looks. I personally feel you're NTA. You're not going to be comfortable, even your kids have said they don't want to go there. Tell her the two of you can co host the event, she can plan everything, you'll provide the space. If she refuses, next year plan to go away for the holiday and make that your new tradition.", "INFO:\nDoes the sister genuinely enjoy hosting? \n\nI could see that being incredibly stressful in a tight space.", "NTA if you kindly offer to let her host at your house so she has more space.\n\nYTA if you insist on hosting and insult her home or living situation.\n\nIf she likes and looks forward to hosting then you could also volunteer to bring over some folding chairs or TV trays and unobtrusively slip some poo-pourri into the bathroom.", "I think NAH. We have a large family and many don\u2019t have the space to host holidays. Everyone knows that and we move on and the people that are willing to have 40 people in their house for a holiday invite people. Surely your SIL knows that that 20 people is a tight squeeze in her home? I also want to say that the size of her house doesn\u2019t necessarily say anything about her wealth. We lived in a house for many years that was smaller than we could afford because we liked the location, house, and didn\u2019t see a need to move. There is nothing wrong with her home at all, just might not accommodate 20 very well.", "NTA and I think everyone saying Y T A is either holier than though or 15 / a student used to dorm parties. How does everyone else feel about the sitting on the floor situation? Are the other families loving the casual party style or secretly wishing you would host? And if sister is actually poor would she not rather have someone else pay for all the food you need for 20ppl? Why don't you host Christmas when there's a sit down meal and she hosts a drinks thing for new years eve or the 26th?", "NTA. Idk why so many people think it\u2019s rude for you to want to host for a better experience for everyone.", "What you should do is talk to your sister in law and ask her what her feelings are on the matter, seeing as it's her space and event you're talking about. Ex: \"I know it gets pretty crowded in your house, is hosting something you enjoy doing? If you feel obligated because it's tradition and it's not because you enjoy doing it, we'll be glad to have it at our place. Just let me know if you ever get sick of it and if you ever need anything, I'm always here.\" No tone, no judgy attitude about it, your SIL feels and is supported rather than judged, and the idea is out there; so if she ever says \"enough of this\" she knows she can go to you. \n\nAnd if you can't do that because you don't talk to your SIL, then it's time you do because you marry the family when you marry the spouse. \n\n(Whatever you do, DO NOT bring up the fact your kids complain. Don't do it. That kind of manipulation will backfire on you completely, I watched an extended family member do that and it caused a year of family drama.)", "NAH for bringing it up to your husband. That's absolutely fair game. I don't blame you for not wanting that situation.\n\nBut I think you need to accept what decision your husband comes to. It's his family and if he wants to broach the issue with his sister that is fine, but if he doesn't it's not your place to step in and decide how the family should handle things.", "NAH. The sister\u2019s doing her share by offering to host, even though her place isn\u2019t really big enough. She hasn\u2019t left anyone out and sounds like she\u2019s doing her best. \nOn the other hand, it\u2019s Christmas and you and your kids obviously want to be comfortable and not eat your food whilst sat on the floor with a dog climbing over you. But if you insisted on hosting instead, I think it\u2019d be rude. Is there a way you can compromise? For example taking a camping table or suggesting a walk after dinner (so you\u2019re not all cramped up together but still spending time together) and then heading home after? Or have a separate, second \u201cChristmas Day\u201d with your kids when you get back home.", "NAH i get your husbands point, but you have an even stronger point. You just have to present it with the right angle. The family is growing and has become full of kids, so more space could be better for the dynamic of the party.", "NTA. You're not trying to shame her for her finances but your SIL doesn't sound like she's able to adequately host. Your kids and complaining and guests have to sit on the floor and fend off a great dane for the holidays?\n\n20+ people shouldn't be strongarmed into putting up with all of that just to spare your SIL's feelings. Especially when viable alternatives exist.", "It\u2019s rude to ask your guests to eat on the floor, even without a giant dog around. NTA", "NTA and all of you saying otherwise, you go sit on the floor of someone's tiny house and smell their stinky bathroom and see how fast you change your mind. Nevermind the fact that it's also a fire hazard and 20 people using 1 bathroom? Get real. The sister SHOULD be thinking about her guests comfort over being upset that she can't host...", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t want to spend Christmas stuffed into a small house with 20 people and have to eat on the floor. Plus there\u2019s only 1 bathroom between all 20 people? That\u2019s a recipe for disaster \n\nIf you and your kids don\u2019t enjoy it you are perfectly within your rights to not go. Her feelings might be hurt but honestly she has to know that her house is not good for hosting such a large group. There are other options (like your house!) so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s her house or nothing. \n\nThe main thing to me is that your kids are complaining about the situation. They deserve to enjoy themselves on Christmas and they won\u2019t if you/your husband make them go to their aunts house. Your husband should be more concerned with his children\u2019s feelings than his sisters", "NAH. A good way to maybe word it to the family is to just say, We have more room. You're more than welcome to come in the morning & we'll cook together. So no one's nose gets too out of joint", "NTA.\n\nYour request seems \"unfair\" to your SIL, but it\u2018s actually pretty reasonable and a nice offer. \n\nEspecially because of the bathroom!", "NAH. Heaven forbid you not want to sit on top of your in-laws on the floor while a dog runs around, with 20+ people in a one bathroom house. I feel like the SIL lacks self-awareness here, but I can understand the desire to host.", "NAH I can understand her hurt feelings but I also wouldn\u2019t want to stand to eat or use a bathroom that smells bad.", "NAH\n\nBut it's all going to depend on how you approach this. Can you reach out to SIL directly and offer to host at your place, while involving her in the planning, etc.? So validate that everyone loves getting together, but you know her place is small, the family is growing, and it must be extra work for her. You can move it to your house and have her help plan the food etc. (so she's co-hosting) instead of taking it away from her completely.", "whenever my family had get togethers we usually did it at my house or my uncles house because we had the best ones for family gatherings. NTA", "NTA, I understand they want to create a nice tradition but sounds like their place isn't fit to host so many people, IMO it's a tad rude to offer when you know everyone will be uncomfortable and all their guests will remember is the bad time they had at aunt's place.", "Uh what are these comments? Do y\u2019all seriously want to eat Christmas dinner on the floor? Will there even be space for a card table and chairs? Will that even be enough, or will people have still have to sit on the floor? Will that work with a big dog running around as well?\n\nEveryone is so righteous until they are put in the position. Y\u2019all wouldn\u2019t want to go to this Christmas either and y\u2019all know it.", "NTA. \n\nJust post in the group chat or whatever that sils house is too small and it would not be realistic for her to host 20 people there. That her house just doesn't work for a mainly gathering. \n\nShe is more than welcome to help you host at your house hut you are pushing for the gathering to be at your house. \n\nIf they push back then be honest. Tell her /them they need to get over it because the bathroom always stinks, the house is too little they have no tables and chairs and they have a gross dog. \n\nLogistically her house doesn't work. Its rude to everyone else to force them to go to sols house just because she wants to host. Who cares if she's poor or her feelings get her. Other people shouldn't have a crappy time just so she fells good hosting. \n\nIf I were you I wouod push for hosting the gathering. Sil can host when she has a bigger house.\n\nPeople shouldn't have to sit on the floor with food they have to protect from a huge dog, especially kids. Just to protect your sils feelings. \n\nShe needs to get over it and stop hosting.", "NTA, but perhaps you can suggest a compromise, that you and SIL co-host the event in your home?", "YTA!!!!! \n\nMy house is tiny but my son and I are allergic to dogs, everybody else in my family has dogs. So they asked if we can host Christmas here so my son doesn't have to take his meds. \nIt's a tiny house, one bathroom, but you know what? Your precious butt can bring a folding chair and drive to Walmart to poop in their toilets instead. \n\nSuck it up. It's one gathering.", "Your tone is pretty judgy here so I see why there\u2019s so many Y T A responses but honestly I think NTA for at least offering the larger space. For a major holiday (assuming we\u2019re talking an all-day gathering, not just an hour or two) I think anyone would be frustrated to have to stand the whole time when a space with adequate seating is an option. Kudos to SIL for being willing to host in the space they have, but she may even be relieved that you offered. (Source: I have a small house myself and although I enjoy hosting, it\u2019s realistically not comfortable for large all-day family events. We\u2019ve been there, done that, and it\u2019s so overstimulating to have everybody on top of each other the whole time when we could just go to my parents\u2019 much larger house and actually enjoy the day.)", "NAH\n\nAnyone who says  Y T A is insane and absolutely lacks compassion for those of people who have limited love for cramped, crowded, loud-ass spaces. There's nothing about this gathering that sounds like it would be fun for more than a few minutes. A duplex is far too small for 20 people at one time. But SIL will probably be offended if you move it, and may be one of those people who takes the request to move the event the wrong way. I'd sit it out and send my love and gifts. Because this sounds like absolute hell.", "YWBTA you could suggest co hosting. Have it at your house and she comes to help cook and decorate. Present it as spreading the work load and cost of it between 2 familys.", "Call your Sil. Suggest to Sil that because of the size house you will offer yours but she can be in charge of planning and cooking, with your help of course.", "NTA if you can offer graciously.... \n\nYou could ask if she needs any help in particular... and then offer that she could be in charge of the food but it could be at your house if ever a bit more space and less prep/ cleaning up makes it easier on her.", "Sorry, YWBTA.\n\nIt's their family thing. It's for your husband to bring up and discuss if everyone's actually uncomfortable.\n\nDefinitely doesn't sound like a fun experience though", "It sounds like the only people who have a problem with the normal arrangement is you and your kids.\n\n>I really don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m this type of person because I don\u2019t judge anybody on their house size or their wealth, but the issue is that his sisters house is so fucking tiny it\u2019s uncomfortable for everyone there.\n\nBut you do, and YTA for it.", "My mom comes from a big family. It got to the point where only 2 of the siblings were able to host because of the size of the group.  The thing is the siblings decided on that.  \n\nYou are married into the family.  I know it\u2019s tough because you are family, but don\u2019t mess with their traditions.   \n\nYou could kindly mention (for her next rotation) that you are willing to host if she wants, but take the no.  Just offer to help her. \n\nI\u2019m not judging because I think you are trying to be kind, but how you handle it now that your husband has said back off is where I will judge you.", "NAH, and I like the suggestion of asking her if she\u2019d be interesting in hosting at your house but still in charge of things. If your kitchen is bigger or something, you could pitch it as a \u201cyou may have an easier time\u2026\u201d thing. There are ways to navigate this that are still sensitive to her feelings and enable her to fulfill the tradition.\n\nI will say, however, that if she declines and you persist, refuse to go to her house, or let your kids complain about it in front of her that YWBTA. Make a kind offer that doesn\u2019t call attention to wealth disparity and suck it up if the offer isn\u2019t taken.", "Why is everyone say YTA??\n\nI don\u2019t understand no one wants to eat on the floor like an animal with a massive dog around too!!\n\nMaybe speak to you SIL and discuss between you what would be a better arrangement.", "NTA for offering. you would be the AH if you didnt do in gently and with love and accept her decision. Otherwise you may end up excluded from future xmas's.", "NTA. 1 bathroom for 20 people at a food centered holiday? Absolutely not", "NAH but perhaps offer to bring extra tables and chairs so more adults can sit.", "Not the asshole\u2026.

Just come up with another valid reason for wanting to host and leave it at that", "YTA. Their system is to rotate, that seems fair.

I probably wouldnt want to be uncomfortable, but be respectful about it. Dont make her feel bad just because your uncomfortable", "NAH, OP this is a tough situation. It's obvious you aren't being unkind, you just want everyone to enjoy the holiday and be comfortable. I like one posters idea of a combined hosting held at your house. I don't know what part of the country you live in but you could also consider renting a tent and/or a port a potty for the day if she insists holding it at hers. \nI hope you find a solution that everyone can feel good about!", "NTA...holidays are already stressful and this honestly doesn't sound like a fun time at all. Who wants to be cramped and having to eat sitting on the floor?? You also cemented this by mentioning the ONE bathroom and it basically smelling like a port-a-potty. That definitely is a mood downer.\n\nSomeone mentioned seeing if she wants to co-host at your house. I'd try that option.", "YTA we get it you think you and your home are/is better then them and theirs.

This is a family Christmas party. If there is any meaning at all to Christmas besides being gracious to your family and loved ones, it is remembering that one time when Jesus Christ was born in cramped stable and slept in a manger. Because **it was so crowded**. And yes, there were animals.

If his side of the family refuses and chooses to go to the sister's house, you can choose not to attend. \n\nI like to host because I like to be in my own space.  The other people have too small of homes to accommodate the family.  When my SIL had a larger home she frequently hosted.  Pets can also be an annoyance.

It\u2019s usually the same people who go every year give or take a few. It is: My husband and I with our 2 kids, his sister and husband with their 3 kids, his younger brother and his daughter, his mom and dad, grandma, usually an aunt and uncle and maybe a cousin or 2.

It actually isn\u2019t even an individual house but it is half of a duplex type. There will be about 20 people coming this year and I just think it\u2019s ridiculous for her to insist on hosting. They also have a large Great Dane that is on top of everyone, well actually everyone is on top of everyone. I shit you not that half of the guests have to sit on the living room floor to eat. Usually the older relatives sit at the 4 person dining table, a few people sit on the couch, and the rest of us are standing or sitting on the floor with our plates of food. OH, and the last big kicker is that there is only ONE bathroom that constantly smells like shit. \n\nMy kids always complain about going to this aunts house because of the reasons I listed. I am siding with them and I said I would talk to dad about us volunteering to host. We don\u2019t live in a mansion but we can comfortably fit all the guests and we have more than 1 bathroom. \n\nHusband doesn\u2019t want to because he says it will hurt his sisters feelings and she already knows how poor they are and this would be rubbing it in her face. I don\u2019t think that should be the case, I think she should want the family to be comfortable. I\u2019m sure she must know we don\u2019t love sitting on the floor in that cramped house.

Why does SIL not have a bigger home? Whether you would ever say this or not, SIL has a more modest home because she did not have the finances to own the home you have.

Bring folding tables and chairs, even camping chairs.", "I would like to frame the issue like this:\n\nFrom your point of view:  Once every four years you are to spend Christmas at your SIL's house.  You feel that her house isn't an optimum choice for hosting.  The issues are a lack of table space for 16 of the 20 guests and only one bathroom.  \n\nI agree that it can suck to not have a table to eat from.  As has been suggested, could you bring or rent a couple of tables and sufficient chairs to give everyone a spot?  You, and your kids, have to smell uncle Al's dumps for a few hours.  Your discomfort lasts 8 hours max, during which time your kids get to know all their relatives a little bit better, with the exception of uncle Albert.\n\nFrom your SIL's point of view:  She can afford living in her home, but maybe not much beyond that.  Once every four years, she can host her family for Christmas.  She is painfully aware that her home isn't the most optimum place to host the family, but it's her home and she can at least feel some equality with her siblings by hosting her family when it's her turn.  She, admittedly, doesn't ensure that her guests are as comfortable as possible, but there could be several reasons for that, including the stress of just pulling off a Christmas dinner for 20 people.  She only has one bathroom and, when uncle Albert drops a duece, it stinks for hours.\n\nThe thing is, taking her turn hosting, regardless of her difficulties in providing a similar experience to her siblings, helps her feel like she's contributing to the family equally to her siblings.  That's a feeling that will stay with her always.\n\nMy question to you is:  Can you justify taking away her good vibes for the next four years so that you and your kids can avoid 8-ish hours of inconvenience?\n\nI think you should also be aware that your SIL knows that you judge her negatively for living in a semi-detached house.  This contributes to her need to host the family when it's her turn.  I do not know where you live, but I have seen townhouses and condos sell for millions of dollars.  Living in a duplex doesn't make you poor, or less of a person.\n\nMy suggestion to you is that you deal with inconfortabilaty for a few hours in order to make life easier on your SIL.

Bring some damn folding chairs and poo-porurri or something.", "I do not judge her for her home. I think she\u2019s a wonderful woman. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best place to host that many people.

She practically says SIL doesn\u2019t even have a \u201creal\u201d house, so she shouldn\u2019t even bother trying to be a part of her family\u2019s hosting tradition. For shame.", "It\u2019s not a gross bathroom. she keeps it clean. With one bathroom and 20 people, it can start to smell.", "It\u2019s really sad that this was downvoted", "They should def just co-host at OPs every year.", "My sister\u2019s and I plan thanksgiving dinner together every year!

Nope.", "That's notably less than 20 people plus a giant boundary stomping dog in a duplex.", "I think this is the best way to go about it! Probably a lot less pressure off her shoulders, tbh, and you can like make some little jokes about being her sous chef or personal assistant to smooth things over, if you think those would fly.", "Like a lot of poor people LOL", "I don't think you're a Y-T-A. I think it's NAH because I think the sister (from your post) isn't trying to be rude, she's trying her best to do the nice thing....as are you. Offering to bring tables/chairs is a good solution.", "Ignore these folks. Remember, it shouldn\u2019t be on the person suffering to host. Rather perhaps, ask them to be heavily involved in making the food. Everyone should be doing what they can to help make these holidays work, rather than putting it all on one of you especially when that\u2019s not really possible.\n\nWhile I understand your husbands position about avoiding injuring their pride, pride is unimportant (or at least should be unimportant) when it comes to family. It is more important that you are a team, the same way your husband and you should be a team. This is an opportunity to work WITH your sister-in-law to create a more available situation FOR THEM as well as a situation at which everyone can be comfortable.\n\nImportantly this also means it is YOUR responsibility to prevent anyone else (I don\u2019t know what your family members are like) from rubbing your sister-in-laws poverty in her face. It is your job to nip any conversation about how much nicer your house is in the bud. Instead use the opportunity to focus on how good her (or her husbands) cooking is. If need be give them access to your kitchen so they can prepare a great mood. Once again, be a team, be a community.\n\nNTA", "I think you\u2019re a bit uppity, but I\u2019m also mad at SIL for having a dog that large in a space that small. Forget Christmas, they need a lot of room in general. No wonder it\u2019s a hyperactive mess.", "You are giving off the wrong impression. Let this woman have this one thing, ONCE every four years, and shut your bratty children down. You're acting entitled and apparently not providing any help, which makes you even worse. Bring a folding table and some chairs, some Fabreeze, all problems solved! Look how easy that was! \n\nAnd yet, you couldn't be bothered to put ANY amount of effort into alleviating the situation. You suck as an SIL. And a person.\n\nYTA.", "That is a lot of traffic. I see your point. \n\nYou might be better off finding a diplomatic way of handling it. Like asking if she can handle the cooking while your home hosts so the work is split up?", "That sounds like a lovely Thanksgiving! I am somewhere up north and in awe, thinking of having a comfy family gathering outdoors in November.", "I'm disabled enough that if I'm supposed to sit on the floor, I'm either not going to go, or after a while, I won't be able to get OFF the floor. I also don't do well with large dogs. I would also not be comfortable going to these gatherings.", "Seriously! OP could have a nice talk with SIL: 'Hey, I know you're an awesome cook and love hosting, but the one-bathroom situation has really taken a toll on my kids in the past. Would it be all right if the meal was here, and I let you have my kitchen for the day? You could absolutely set everything up a week beforehand and make sure I have everything on-hand you'd need.'

It has been written up by newspapers. People sit everywhere because they love the company. Not everyone goes for the dining set up. Lady needs to loosen up.", "My aunt lives in an old (think 40+ years old) mobile home. In the past she use to host huge parties and no one complained about where they had to sit. Everyone just enjoyed the food, company, and music. If OP is so bothered by where to sit then offering to bring extra chairs solves that. For the bathroom her husband could offer to go help his sister \"set up\" for the party and include a quick wipe down and light a candle or put a plugin in there. The dog could be placed in the bedroom after being taken out to do his business and work off some energy. There are solutions to the problems OP listed if someone just spends a few minutes thinking. I've been to parties in nice very large houses and in tiny apartments. The only thing that would ruin it for me is if the people there are being rude or dismissive. If everyone is talking and enjoying themselves it shouldn't matter if it's a duplex instead of a mansion.", "You also only \"know\" that everyone is uncomfortable because OP claims that they are without actually confirming with any of them. I think that's the biggest sign that OP is the asshole here. They made a generalization to rationalize their own discomfort.", "I mean, yeah, people remember the good stuff. You don't remember the fighting or the smell or being uncomfortable a lot of the time. Doesn't mean that didn't happen.", "Oh, so you get free labor and food and take all the credit?   This isn't the flex you think it is.", "We call it a bush wee and its a very valid option when the bathroom is taken!

Which is understandable when I found out they don't get the same link that I get FROM THEIR AUTOMOD. I tried to point this out and tell them that's ridiculous.

OP is speaking for herself and some members of her family and her intent is not to hurt SIL, that\u2019s obviously why she came here for advice and other alternatives/ideas. most people enjoy their personal space, 20 people with one bathroom must suck and i don\u2019t think a big dog should be in such a tight and limited space. that just wouldn\u2019t sit well with me personally. it\u2019s also just not that deep, they love SIL and it\u2019s not the end of the world if she doesn\u2019t host christmas at her place it really isn\u2019t that serious.", "OP literally is stepping up to help by offering to host lol", "Current duplex dweller with a great dane and two kids (moving to a whole house in a couple months and THANK GOD) and I can't second this enough. There are a few events I'd love to host, but there just isn't space in this domicile, even if you include the yard. I barely even feel comfortable having a couple of friends over right now, much less TWENTY PEOPLE. People would be constantly bumping shoulders and running into each other. No thank you.", "My family always rotated between houses for holidays. There were typically between 25 and 35 people who attended, and there weren't many places that could accommodate that many bodies, so it typically bounced between 4 houses. Ours was by far the least extravagant home that hosted, but we knew people would always have a seat at one of the many tables. The people who never hosted understood that their homes/layouts just couldn't hold as many people and wanted everyone to be comfortable. They loved hosting things like birthday parties at their houses because eating cake while standing is totally fine. There comes a time when you need to set aside your pride for others, and I think when people have to sit on the floor with a large dog running around is one of those times. Or, at the very least, invest in some folding tables and chairs.", "I agree, but I don't think it's too tricky.  It's one day out of 1,095.  You can suck up something mildly uncomfortable for a day.  \n\nOr, if op hates it so much, she can just not go.", "The problem with this comment is that her home IS inadequate to host a large number of people and that's okay. It's not a slight on the sister. Lots of people live in small homes for many reasons, often practical, and that's nothing to be embarrassed about and certainly does not mean they are inadequate as a person.  \n\n  \n\nHow many people would have to be invited for it to be okay to offer a bigger space? 30? 40? 50?

Folding table wont help that. Also if you want to host an event, requiring your guests to bring their own seats and table is absolutely ridiculous.

You have the bigger house, bigger yard - great we'll be there! \n\nMy Mom and Dad's house is really small. Through a 90th birthday party for my Dad this past weekend. Guess what? We split up days and brought multiple great-grandchildren in shifts. Not a damn person lost their mind over it.", "I think there is a difference too. If you only had pond water to drink then you\u2019re going to drink it, but later down the road if you come across a bottle of water are you going to say nah I don\u2019t want to drink that cause I was drinking pond water contently already.

Yeah, so what, I have less money and much less space than some of my friends and family, and I'm not going to pretend like I'm well off.  But I do what I can with what I've got, and the only thing that matters are the hugs I give, the memories I make, and the people I get to be with, never know when it will be the last time with them or them with me, and that's all that matters.  Snobbery is a state of mind, just like ownership of not being \"rich\".", "That would be uncomfortable. GD are huge and goofy and don\u2019t always realize how big they are or care if they slobber all over you. (I love my GD) Have you talked to SIL?

Half of the post consisted of rock-solid reasons to not attend a large party in a small place.\n\nMy friends and I think about this every Thanksgiving and Christmas too.

I think the \u201cgood excuse\u201d comment meant something that doesn\u2019t make her feel bad. If pointing out that one bathroom or sitting on the floor is less than ideal is going to make her feel bad, I get the point, but don\u2019t know what else you could possibly say. Maybe one of the kids has become deathly afraid of dogs (so lie basically)? That\u2019s probably not the best idea. \n\nI gotta say, this short thread had more actual constructive advice/feedback than most of the others I\u2019ve read that are full of assholes that are butthurt on SIL\u2019s behalf.", "We're doing something similar this year.
