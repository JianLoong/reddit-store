{"id": 17517, "submission_id": "13kbv9f", "title": "WIBTA if I took a step back from planning fun events for my boyfriend's kids after not being acknowledged on Mother's Day?", "selftext": "My (34F) boyfriend (38M) has two kids from a previous marriage (ages 6 and 8) that we're supposed to get for two weekends a month, but because he works in retail, we don't get to see them that regularly and certainly not as much as either of us would like. Because of this, we make a point of trying to do as much fun stuff with them when we have them so that, at the very least, we're making the little time we get to see them as enjoyable and memorable as possible.\n\nI am very much a planner, and I am always looking for fun events in the area that we can take them to.  If I don't plan something for the time we have them, then it's usually just playgrounds and/or board games and video games when they visit. Don't get me wrong, that is perfectly fine, I just mean if I don't plan something, then nothing extra fun or exciting happens. We've also agreed to split the cost of all these events 50/50.\n\nOn Mother's Day this past weekend, I got a bunch of \"Happy Bonus Mother's Day\" texts from friends and family, but nothing from my partner. About halfway through the day I straight up asked him why he had not acknowledged me for being a bonus mom. His response was something along the lines of, \"Well you're sort of a bonus mom, but I don't think we really need to acknowledge it until it's official, like when we get married.\" I replied that I didn't think that was right, but we could agree to disagree. Also, when I say \"acknowledged\" I don't mean showered with gifts or anything - I would have been perfectly okay with just a hug and \"Thanks for being a great bonus mom to my kids.\" The fact he couldn't even do that has me feeling quite salty.\n\nNow, I don't want his kids to suffer for his behavior, but I also don't want to put a ton of time, effort and money into planning fun events for them in the future since its clearly not appreciated. We can still do the typical playground and games when they come over and if he were to plan something, I would still split it 50/50 with him - I just don't want to be the one doing the research anymore.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I took a step back from planning fun events for my boyfriend's kids after not being acknowledged on Mother's Day?\n\nEdit: Since it has come up a lot in the comments - I thought the term \"bonus mom\" was meant for women who are in a part time care taking position for children, not a kinder term for \"step-mom\". I am well aware that I am not a \"Mother\" or \"Step-Mother\" - I am simply saying I wish my partner gave me recognition for how much time and attention I give his children.\n\n**UPDATE:** When we got home from work, I asked my partner if we could talk - I was transparent about putting the post on Reddit and told him how much the lack of recognition hurt. He heard me out and explained that the question caught him off guard the day of, that he reacted poorly in the moment and agreed he should have done SOME sort of recognition for everything I do for him and the kids. He also mentioned that after I mentioned it on Sunday, he considered asking the kids to call or text me, but was worried it would be confusing for them given they are so young. I explained that I totally understood and was not expecting anything from them and would not want to confuse them either. All is well here now - thanks for your contributions!\n\nAlso, some of y'all seem to think that planning the events and hanging out with them a little bit is ALL I do for them - but it's not. Yes, I only see them 4 days a month, but I am very much involved with their caretaking when they're here. I've taken off days of work to take care of them when they're sick and parents can't get the day off, too.

First of all, I want to say that it's clear you care about your boyfriend's kids and put a lot of effort into making their time with you both enjoyable and memorable.\n\nIn my opinion, you wouldn't be the asshole if you decided to take a step back from planning fun events. It's important to have open communication with your partner about your feelings and expectations. You can express to him how his lack of acknowledgement on Mother's Day made you feel and that you'd appreciate more recognition for your role in the children's lives.\n\nThat being said, it's important not to let his actions negatively impact the kids. Perhaps you could find a middle ground where you still help plan activities, but not to the same extent as before. This way, you can still contribute to their happiness without feeling overwhelmed or underappreciated.\n\nRemember, you and your boyfriend are a team, and both of you should work together to ensure the well-being and happiness of his children.

Expecting him to cover all the cost would be like inviting someone out on a date and expecting them to pay for 4 people. You should definitely reign it in.

Whats weird is that you want it on **mother's day**. Tbh my judgement would be more ESH because he clearly doesn't appreciate effort, and this should not be tied to your marriage or not. It seems he is more about official titles than bonding and hard work.

Thank you for asking!\n\nYou are working at building relationships with small children.  In the long run, if that relationship is beneficial to them, **they** will acknowledge it - whether on Mother's Day or at other times of the year.  But even if they were old enough now to be able to do something for you and to navigate how they could do it without hurting their primary mother's feelings, you shouldn't expect them to make that commitment until you have been around for several years and you and your partner have made some commitments of permanence to each other (e.g. marrying, buying property together, building the kids' college funds, etc).    So from that POV, you should keep trying to build relationships with the kids, but should not expect immediate rewards.    \n\n\nOn the other hand -- you need to find out more from your boyfriend about why he wants to slow things down.  Maybe he is protecting his kids from being hurt because he's had girlfriends drop out of their lives before.  Maybe he doesn't plan to increase his own attention to them and he doesn't want you to push him into more relationship with the kids than he wants.  Maybe he doesn't plan to get married to you, or to stay with you much longer.  Maybe he thinks that other members of his family and circle are judging you for how hard you're trying to buy the kids' affection.  Those are hard conversations, but you really need to have them.  Maybe there's something about how you are interacting with the kids that he doesn't approve of, or that's making his job as parent harder.    \n\n\nAlso - in the long run, if you want to be a parent rather than a fun visitor, you need to calm down with the treats and special excursions.

Because of this, we make a point of trying to do as much fun stuff with them when we have them so that, at the very least, we're making the little time we get to see them as enjoyable and memorable as possible.\n\nI am very much a planner, and I am always looking for fun events in the area that we can take them to.  If I don't plan something for the time we have them, then it's usually just playgrounds and/or board games and video games when they visit. Don't get me wrong, that is perfectly fine, I just mean if I don't plan something, then nothing extra fun or exciting happens. We've also agreed to split the cost of all these events 50/50.\n\nOn Mother's Day this past weekend, I got a bunch of \"Happy Bonus Mother's Day\" texts from friends and family, but nothing from my partner. About halfway through the day I straight up asked him why he had not acknowledged me for being a bonus mom. His response was something along the lines of, \"Well you're sort of a bonus mom, but I don't think we really need to acknowledge it until it's official, like when we get married.\" I replied that I didn't think that was right, but we could agree to disagree. Also, when I say \"acknowledged\" I don't mean showered with gifts or anything - I would have been perfectly okay with just a hug and \"Thanks for being a great bonus mom to my kids.\" The fact he couldn't even do that has me feeling quite salty.\n\nNow, I don't want his kids to suffer for his behavior, but I also don't want to put a ton of time, effort and money into planning fun events for them in the future since its clearly not appreciated. We can still do the typical playground and games when they come over and if he were to plan something, I would still split it 50/50 with him - I just don't want to be the one doing the research anymore.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I took a step back from planning fun events for my boyfriend's kids after not being acknowledged on Mother's Day?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Some step-parents don't like referring to their SO's children as \"step kids,\" so they use the term \"bonus kids.\"", "> My apologies, I meant no disrespect.\n\nAnd yet you're claiming you deserve Mother's Day acknowledgment after seeing your boyfriends kids four days a month.\n\nINFO: If you had the kids full time and hired a babysitter once a week, would you give them Mother's/Father's Day acknowledgment, too?", "You chose to date a man with children. Those children are more important than you for days a month. If you don\u2019t like taking care of them out of the kindness of your own heart, then why are you with a man with children? Very pick me energy.\n\nThe fact that you change the way you treat and spend time with the kids over this tells me you\u2019re not ready to be with anyone with children.", "\u201c\u2026providing care when they are here\u201d\n\nThis seems to be the point you\u2019re completely glossing over. You see them maybe twice a month, and that\u2019s a big MAYBE according to you. You\u2019re both babysitters, maybe you even more than your bf apparently but either way - in no world are you a mom, step-mom, bonus mom or any other type of mom here. You barely see these kids.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to have your feelings, but you came to reddit for an answer to a question - and no amount of trying to argue with commenters will make that answer what you want it to be. If for no other reason, than because your trump card is \u2018I\u2019m not going to plan any more extra fun stuff so HA\u2019 when no one asked you to do that in the first place \u2026? It seems you guys have made up as per your update so I now congratulate you for turning a holiday that had nothing to do with you into a problem all about you :)", "You\u2019re intentionally parsing out people\u2019s comments because it\u2019s easier that just admitting YTA. You understand exactly why the comparison was made. Good luck and I hope you get what you\u2019re looking for", "Again, gonna go ahead and disagree only because of lack of info/opportunity.  Now if she re-posts at a later time saying they have the kids more and she\u2019s disinterested in doing these things with them, then I would agree. However, you cannot judge someone on inaction due to opportunities they were never given.  I guess I\u2019m being the optimist here and according to her update, my thoughts on bf not really putting two and two together seem to be spot on. As far as the other stuff, I guess only time will tell as their relationship evolves.", "Needy?", "Awesome - again, thank you for explaining this to me! I really, really appreciate it!!", "Never mind, I take back the apology.", "It's not \"so ha\" though...? It's a way to not exhaust myself if it's not appreciated...? I chose something I was doing that was extra and not asked for particularly because it was extra and not asked for...? I didn't turn the holiday into a problem about me, I dropped it the day of the holiday very quickly...? \n\nJust because you typed a lot, doesn't mean you're accurate :)", "Yes. You barely see these kids and already insist on a bonus mom label. You\u2019re rushing things. Even if you do get married, you can\u2019t force this. Those kids many never see you as any type of mother figure. Ease up.", "And defensive. Otherwise you would have read the rest of the comment and realized it\u2019s spot on to what\u2019s the situation", "You're very welcome. :)", "Awwwe, you're really not liking being told you're wrong, huh?", "and just because you babysit twice a month doesn\u2019t make you a mom :)", "I apologized for a misunderstanding and you're continuing to be nasty, so I'm simply no longer sorry to you in particular.", "^^^ I really hope you don\u2019t have any children. You\u2019re obviously a bully. A poor excuse for an internet bully, but still.", "Police???!?!? There\u2019s been a murder!!"]}
