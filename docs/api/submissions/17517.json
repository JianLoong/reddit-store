{"id": 17517, "submission_id": "13kbv9f", "title": "WIBTA if I took a step back from planning fun events for my boyfriend's kids after not being acknowledged on Mother's Day?", "selftext": "My (34F) boyfriend (38M) has two kids from a previous marriage (ages 6 and 8) that we're supposed to get for two weekends a month, but because he works in retail, we don't get to see them that regularly and certainly not as much as either of us would like. Because of this, we make a point of trying to do as much fun stuff with them when we have them so that, at the very least, we're making the little time we get to see them as enjoyable and memorable as possible.\n\nI am very much a planner, and I am always looking for fun events in the area that we can take them to.  If I don't plan something for the time we have them, then it's usually just playgrounds and/or board games and video games when they visit. Don't get me wrong, that is perfectly fine, I just mean if I don't plan something, then nothing extra fun or exciting happens. We've also agreed to split the cost of all these events 50/50.\n\nOn Mother's Day this past weekend, I got a bunch of \"Happy Bonus Mother's Day\" texts from friends and family, but nothing from my partner. About halfway through the day I straight up asked him why he had not acknowledged me for being a bonus mom. His response was something along the lines of, \"Well you're sort of a bonus mom, but I don't think we really need to acknowledge it until it's official, like when we get married.\" I replied that I didn't think that was right, but we could agree to disagree. Also, when I say \"acknowledged\" I don't mean showered with gifts or anything - I would have been perfectly okay with just a hug and \"Thanks for being a great bonus mom to my kids.\" The fact he couldn't even do that has me feeling quite salty.\n\nNow, I don't want his kids to suffer for his behavior, but I also don't want to put a ton of time, effort and money into planning fun events for them in the future since its clearly not appreciated. We can still do the typical playground and games when they come over and if he were to plan something, I would still split it 50/50 with him - I just don't want to be the one doing the research anymore.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I took a step back from planning fun events for my boyfriend's kids after not being acknowledged on Mother's Day?\n\nEdit: Since it has come up a lot in the comments - I thought the term \"bonus mom\" was meant for women who are in a part time care taking position for children, not a kinder term for \"step-mom\". I am well aware that I am not a \"Mother\" or \"Step-Mother\" - I am simply saying I wish my partner gave me recognition for how much time and attention I give his children.\n\n**UPDATE:** When we got home from work, I asked my partner if we could talk - I was transparent about putting the post on Reddit and told him how much the lack of recognition hurt. He heard me out and explained that the question caught him off guard the day of, that he reacted poorly in the moment and agreed he should have done SOME sort of recognition for everything I do for him and the kids. He also mentioned that after I mentioned it on Sunday, he considered asking the kids to call or text me, but was worried it would be confusing for them given they are so young. I explained that I totally understood and was not expecting anything from them and would not want to confuse them either. All is well here now - thanks for your contributions!\n\nAlso, some of y'all seem to think that planning the events and hanging out with them a little bit is ALL I do for them - but it's not. Yes, I only see them 4 days a month, but I am very much involved with their caretaking when they're here. I've taken off days of work to take care of them when they're sick and parents can't get the day off, too.

First of all, I want to say that it's clear you care about your boyfriend's kids and put a lot of effort into making their time with you both enjoyable and memorable.\n\nIn my opinion, you wouldn't be the asshole if you decided to take a step back from planning fun events. It's important to have open communication with your partner about your feelings and expectations. You can express to him how his lack of acknowledgement on Mother's Day made you feel and that you'd appreciate more recognition for your role in the children's lives.\n\nThat being said, it's important not to let his actions negatively impact the kids. Perhaps you could find a middle ground where you still help plan activities, but not to the same extent as before. This way, you can still contribute to their happiness without feeling overwhelmed or underappreciated.\n\nRemember, you and your boyfriend are a team, and both of you should work together to ensure the well-being and happiness of his children.

Expecting him to cover all the cost would be like inviting someone out on a date and expecting them to pay for 4 people. You should definitely reign it in.

Whats weird is that you want it on **mother's day**. Tbh my judgement would be more ESH because he clearly doesn't appreciate effort, and this should not be tied to your marriage or not. It seems he is more about official titles than bonding and hard work.

Thank you for asking!\n\nYou are working at building relationships with small children.  In the long run, if that relationship is beneficial to them, **they** will acknowledge it - whether on Mother's Day or at other times of the year.  But even if they were old enough now to be able to do something for you and to navigate how they could do it without hurting their primary mother's feelings, you shouldn't expect them to make that commitment until you have been around for several years and you and your partner have made some commitments of permanence to each other (e.g. marrying, buying property together, building the kids' college funds, etc).    So from that POV, you should keep trying to build relationships with the kids, but should not expect immediate rewards.    \n\n\nOn the other hand -- you need to find out more from your boyfriend about why he wants to slow things down.  Maybe he is protecting his kids from being hurt because he's had girlfriends drop out of their lives before.  Maybe he doesn't plan to increase his own attention to them and he doesn't want you to push him into more relationship with the kids than he wants.  Maybe he doesn't plan to get married to you, or to stay with you much longer.  Maybe he thinks that other members of his family and circle are judging you for how hard you're trying to buy the kids' affection.  Those are hard conversations, but you really need to have them.  Maybe there's something about how you are interacting with the kids that he doesn't approve of, or that's making his job as parent harder.    \n\n\nAlso - in the long run, if you want to be a parent rather than a fun visitor, you need to calm down with the treats and special excursions.

Because of this, we make a point of trying to do as much fun stuff with them when we have them so that, at the very least, we're making the little time we get to see them as enjoyable and memorable as possible.\n\nI am very much a planner, and I am always looking for fun events in the area that we can take them to.  If I don't plan something for the time we have them, then it's usually just playgrounds and/or board games and video games when they visit. Don't get me wrong, that is perfectly fine, I just mean if I don't plan something, then nothing extra fun or exciting happens. We've also agreed to split the cost of all these events 50/50.\n\nOn Mother's Day this past weekend, I got a bunch of \"Happy Bonus Mother's Day\" texts from friends and family, but nothing from my partner. About halfway through the day I straight up asked him why he had not acknowledged me for being a bonus mom. His response was something along the lines of, \"Well you're sort of a bonus mom, but I don't think we really need to acknowledge it until it's official, like when we get married.\" I replied that I didn't think that was right, but we could agree to disagree. Also, when I say \"acknowledged\" I don't mean showered with gifts or anything - I would have been perfectly okay with just a hug and \"Thanks for being a great bonus mom to my kids.\" The fact he couldn't even do that has me feeling quite salty.\n\nNow, I don't want his kids to suffer for his behavior, but I also don't want to put a ton of time, effort and money into planning fun events for them in the future since its clearly not appreciated. We can still do the typical playground and games when they come over and if he were to plan something, I would still split it 50/50 with him - I just don't want to be the one doing the research anymore.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I took a step back from planning fun events for my boyfriend's kids after not being acknowledged on Mother's Day?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That\u2019s rather a slap in the face to their mother who truly does take care of them.", "Yes, thank you, I get all that.\n\nIt doesn't answer my question though as to who the hell this person thinks they are and what right they have to say something like this. \n\nClearly you're cut from the same cloth so I'll leave it there.", "Doesn\u2019t sound at all from the \u201cbonus mom\u201d comments that she was fishing..?\n\nAcknowledging the great job she does should be done regularly, that\u2019s the whole point of appreciation and respect. \n\nNot a mom on Mother\u2019s Day.. so it wasn\u2019t her day", "Did you actually read OP\u2019s post? Or her comments? She\u2019s simply asking that her boyfriend recognizes the time and effort she has put into entertaining his children and ensuring that they have a good time when they visit. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with asking for that if that\u2019s the role she plays in their lives. She\u2019s not asking the children for anything. She\u2019s not punishing the boyfriend. She just wants her efforts to be recognized and appreciated.", "I agree he doesn\u2019t owe her for Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nI DO think he owes more appreciation in general.", "Nope, not stepping back on any level of affection. I can still bring joy and fun into their lives without doing all the extra research.", "I don\u2019t know dude I feel like people are being rough on here. I was wished happy Mother\u2019s Day by multiple people who knew I didn\u2019t have children. People can have different opinions but some people seem really hurt by this and I don\u2019t really get it", "You're not allowed to say anything about women on this sub. Only men bashing is allowed here.", "> Correct - which is a term to me that means I am acknowledging that I am not their mother, nor their step-mother, nor a primary caretaker for the children. \n\nIt's a term that, to me, and I don't think I'm the only person, is taken as you saying that you *are* a mother figure for them. Which is reinforced by you bringing it up because you weren't recognized on mother's day. It wasn't 'bonus mom day', and it wasn't addressing if there's recognition in general in the relationship for what you do, it was specifically that you wanted to be acknowledged on a day called mother's day that a large number of people associate specifically with mothers.", "Sounds like you were doing it for the boyfriend not for the kids.\n\nLook, honestly? It kinda sounds from all these comments like you are done with this guy.", "I'm a little torn because on one hand I think it would be a nice gesture if he got you something to show appreciation, on the other this is going to be harsh but it seems you've seen these kids roughly 25 times total and that seems a little soon to be Imputting yourself as a mother figure. The situation seems difficult seeing your precious post about how his ex has been but I'm more interested that he's ok seeing his kids once a month and hasn't taken her to court.", "You keep saying this but everyone else keeps telling you\u2026 you ARE stepping back. You are in denial, but you are.", "Not even remotely close, but uh\u2026 ok.", "I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s a punishment since they aren\u2019t entitled to her efforts. She\u2019s not saying no to trips, the kids father can still provide that to them.", "Understandable- so if I may clarify- we don\u2019t have a regular schedule of seeing them every other weekend, but we take them as much as we can - plus birthday parties, recitals, etc. Sometimes this works out to once a month, but others its 3 times a month or two in a row. We also get them for an entire week over one of their school breaks and in the summer we get them various random days as his schedule allows. There have been times we\u2019ve asked to see them and their mom has said no for stupid reasons, which makes it so we don\u2019t see them as often as we\u2019d like - because we always want to see them. I don\u2019t expect them to see me as a mom/mother figure - as much as she drives me crazy, they have a really good mom who is raising them well. I just wanted a \u201chey thanks\u201d from my partner.", "Ok then yeah, you need to keep strengthening the relationship with the kids!\n\nI get your frustrations and you should keep the conversation going with him for sure. And the kids need to be taught to do nice little things for you as well.", "She isn\u2019t their mother period- bonus or not. Planning fun things for her boyfriend\u2019s children for *four* days out of the month is insignificant to the bulk of the parenting that their mother actually does. \n\nShould her boyfriend acknowledge her going above and beyond for his children. Absolutely he should but to lump that into being acknowledged on Mother\u2019s Day. GTFO with that. \n\nOP has zero idea of what parenting really is if she thinks planning fun outings for them is what makes her the bonus mom. She is totally coming off as needy and entitled.", "YTA but not for stepping back from planning things for his kids, let him decide how to spend time with them. The reason you're TA is because you're so focused on this \"bonus mom\" thing that you expected to be celebrated on a holiday that has nothing to do with you. You aren't their mom, you're their dad's girlfriend. Don't forget that. \n\nYes, he should show you appreciation for helping out with his kids, but the \"bonus mom\" thing seems overbearing. Take a step back and let him raise his kids.", "You might wanna re think marrying this guy...he's not going to acknowledge you as their step mom til marriage....I wouldn't be doing any big things tbh", "YTA you are not a bonus mom. You are dads fun girlfriend that they see 4 times a month", "Unreal\u2026.NTA, when is acknowledging someone\u2019s efforts a bad thing?! I have been with my significant other for 4 years, each of us have 2 daughters from our previous marriages- we are NOT married, but both of us get a happy Mother\u2019s/Father\u2019s Day from each other\u2019s children (ages 7&9, 12&16) and each other. I acknowledge his role as a step parent, because his ACTIONS are that of a step-dad. Same goes for me with his daughters- we see them every other weekend, and extended time in the summer, as I work less to spend more time with all the kids. I have gone to school events solo when he can\u2019t get work off, so they know WE are there and support them. I love them and go out of my way for them whenever I can. They see that and acknowledge my efforts, and always wish me a happy mothers day.  Good on you for communicating this to your partner \ud83d\udc4f", "Why would you get a happy Mother\u2019s Day from them. Wtf YTA", "YWBTA\n\nI am also doing a lot of fun activities with my niece and nephew. That does not make me a mother or something similar.\nYou are taking care of them 4 days a month. Nice.\nBut you are not their mother, you are a friend.\n\nSo sorry, for me it's weird you wants acknowledged for that. They have a mom. Get your own children if you want to celebrate a fictional day.", "YTA. You're not their mother. You're not even their step mother, which is what \"bonus mom\" means. \n\nAnd now you want to stop planning these \"fun\" events because you have the emotional capacity as a bag of rocks.", "I didn\u2019t expect anything from the children, so not really applicable, but thanks for the contribution.", "You aren't an anything mom, even though you gave yourself the label of bonus mom. Mother's Day is a day for mothers.", "Honestly? So that we can do more with the kids. If I pay 50% instead of 25% that is DOUBLE the amount of things we can do with them. I have a big heart and really just want to bring joy to these little ones.", "Thanks for you sexist insinuation about men\n\nIf I do something for my friends kids do I also become a mother and deserve a Mother\u2019s Day gift ? No \u2026. Because I am not their mum in any meaningful way  \n\nIncidentally if my girlfriend was angry at me because we have dogs and I didn\u2019t get her a Mother\u2019s Day gift it would make me seriously question her", "A lot of people with animals celebrate Mother's Day and they're not real mothers. She has a caregiving role, and just wanted to thanked for basically planning all the kids activities because the dad doesn't do it. Is that so wrong?", "Well, if you\u2019d actually read the post or any of the comments I have agreed with a lot of what you are saying. I don\u2019t expect anything from the children at all and don\u2019t want to confuse them or take away from their actual mother by asking them to reach out on Mothers Day. I just wanted a simple thanks from their father for stepping into a caretaking roll for his children.\n\nI\u2019ve also stated multiple times that I do not equate having them a couple weekends a month with being a full fledged mother and never will. I want nothing of monetary value from the children or my partner, but a thanks would be nice.", "\"Takes for granite \" love it.", "The amount of people who are simultaneously saying I am absolutely not a mother but should be devoting all my free time to these children but also should get zero thanks for children that are not mine because I am very clearly not a mom or bonus mom or a mother figure by their definition is astounding\u2026", "No, people really are not. I wished my friend Happy Mother's Day because she is a cat mom. She is more responsible than someone who expects it for watching kids 4 days a month. She was upset by not being acknowledged. Even babysitters need to think a little ahead when watching someone else's children. I babysat growing up and had to think of a kids' bedtime. I was constantly trying to take care of them, clean up after them, and even be there if they got sick. I had the same status as OP but saw the kids more than she did.", "I didn't bash women. I merely pointed out that having a dog doesn't make someone a mother.  It belittles the most important job on the planet. Apparently, pointing that out is strictly verboten too.", "Not in denial, everyone on here is making A LOT of inaccurate assumptions - such as the children would punished in any way shape or form. If I were to close myself off emotionally because of this, yeah, that would be stepping back a level of affection. That\u2019s not the case. I don\u2019t need to plan all these extravagant events to show my love for them and it\u2019s ridiculous that you think I do.", "Then don't take on that responsibility. No is a full sentence. You dont need to babysit, but you can't receive the benefits of being a mom or mother figure. \n\nAnd stop arguing with everyone. You asked for an opinion, and people decided. YTA.", "That definitly makes sense, I don't think this is the right solution though. If you stop taking them places they are going to notice amd it will probably feel like a punishment to them. Either way innocent kids would still face a form of punishment due to your relationship problems. I personally think it would be best to just tell your partner it hurt that you put in effort to treat his kids in the best way possible and do what you can for them and he didn't show some level of appreciation. It's possible he just didn't put it together, it's possible he just didn't care but the best thing is to just get it out in the open and figure it out from there not have kids sitting there wondering why you used to take them places amd stopped.", "I did, thanks!", "Agreed, and I am so grateful to have a partner I can talk to and communicate with. I thought I did by bringing it up, but he didn\u2019t realize how hurt I was by it.\n\nThey do in their own little ways. They picked out very thoughtful gifts for me for Christmas and his oldest has said \u201cI love to make you laugh\u201d any time she has me in stitches - which is a lot because she\u2019s a laugh riot!!\n\nThank you for your understanding!", "And she does, she isn't technically their mother but she IS parenting them you can be a parent without having the title.", "Right, and this is where my head was at and why I posted. We did end up talking about it, he agreed he should have done *something* and gave me the hug and thanks I wanted.", ">she IS parenting them you can be a parent without having the title\n\nShe sees them 4 DAYS A MONTH!! You can be a parent without the title, but you can't be a parent just by seeing them 4 days a month, and not even that.", "Lol not happy I'm so late but happy it worked out well.", "Thank you!!"]}
