{"id": 32092, "submission_id": "187wkr2", "title": "AITA for deciding to talk to MIL about her response to my husband (28M) when I requested disconnection their bank account?", "selftext": "2 years ago when my now husband  proposed to  me, during a conversation  she exclaimed  if she wants she can find out what the ring cost since she has access to his account. Although I wasn't mad, but thinking further about it, it didn't sit well with me because it shows a lack of boundary. \n\nFast forward to after our wedding last December, I asked my husband to disconnect his account from his mom's, mind you, this is account his paychecks always go to. I asked him of this, this past  Spring and nothing. The last couple months, I have been more persistent about it and we had small fights about. He insists that it doesn't influence his life and it's not  like she is touching his money. I told him it's not a concern about her touching his money, it's more because of the fact that she has some visibility on our  household through his account. This is an account that she created for him as a teenager, has not bothered to disconnect as he transition into adulthood. As an alternative, I told him to open another account when his paychecks can go to if he doesn't want to go through asking her. He said no. \n\nLast week, he finally asked her explaining that I'm worried about her visibility into his finances and her response was why do I care? Since this was response, this led me to believe that she was upset at my request. On my end, money is not the reason and didn't want my intention misconstrued. I personally find it weird that at 28 that his account is connected to hers. I also think that on her end, she uses financial connection to assert some sort of power. For example, she threw a fit when he asked years ago to move to my phone account to do buy one get one free deal. \n\nAfter hearing of her response, I called her up and explained to her why I want his account disconnected from hers in my own words. She in turns, hung up after exclaiming that the account doesn't have much money in it and why do I care and that his brother who has 80k in his account still has his account connected to hers. Her response further validated my point as this is what I fear from her, her blabbing his financial stuff to others because she can see it. \n\nAfter she hung up, I sent her a text message finishing what I was trying to say, saying that it wasn't meant to upset her. It was more to clarify things. She in turns, called my husband and sent him my text message. My husband thinks that I overdid it and basically harassed and that I shouldn't have spoken to her about it since he already spoke to her.\n\nAs Christmas approaches, I know we most likely will go to her house. Out of respect for my husband, I will go but beside saying hi and bye, I refuse to have any conversation with her. Would I be the asshole to not communicate with her there and ask my husband in advance that I do not want to partake in any gift giving or receiving?", "created_utc": 1701386864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187wkr2/aita_for_deciding_to_talk_to_mil_about_her/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s the one who should be standing up to her and sticking up for you. Instead he\u2019s taking her side . You\u2019re NTA for wanting her off the account but I don\u2019t think ignoring her is going to bother her as much as you think it will.", "I can't believe you're putting up with this.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYet another Mummy's boy who won't stand up to his Mother.\n\nNot sure there is a lot you can do if he won't budge on this. TBH I would start refusing to go to his parents until he opens a new independent bank account.", "NTA- This is a huge over step by his mom. She has no business being so involved.   \nDo you each have your own bank accounts? I ask because you said his checks go into the one with his mom on the account, are you also on the account?   \nIt's just weird to me and not something I would be comfortable with as a spouse or as a parent.", "ESH. Your problem isn't with your MIL, it's with your husband. He's the one with whom you have joined your life and presumably have some sort of financial understanding. He needs to disconnect the financial training wheels mommy installed years ago. \n\nWhy does she need that access? And why does he feel better when she has it?", "NTA.     You gotta ask yourself if she is intrusive in other areas of your marriage?  It is weird that he shares his banking with his mother.  She already shared his siblings private information.  It is kind of creepy.", "NTA - this would be an odd situation for any adult with a spouse, but she also proved she oversteps boundaries several times!  Her kicking off at your request raises some very apparent questions - why does she care about seeing his finances?  Why is she SO determined to keep this power?  It's an obvious tactic on her part to gaslight you into looking unreasonable to get the spotlight off her dodgy behaviour.\n\nBut more concerning is your husband's response to this. If it's something that bothers you, and there is no reason for it to continue, why wouldn't he just agree with you in the first place?  He put his mother's wishes over yours, and then left you to deal with it.  Not cool, to say the least.\n\nNot sure why you would still need to show respect to your husband by going to her house, when he has disrespected you here.", "YTA:  But hear me out.  Your MIL owes you nothing. She never once promised to love honor and obey you.  You know who did.....your husband.  So, when he refuses to agree with you on something there's no reason to run to his mom even it involves her.  Because let's say she finally agreed with you and got off the account.  You would know you husband only did it because Mommy said it was ok not because you asked him too.  \n\nYou have a husband problem not a MIL problem.  Focus on that", "Y.TA to yourself for not insisting your adult husband have his own mommy-free bank account before marrying him.", "Here if there are 2 people on an account and one dies it becomes property of the other one . Which means if he died it would become hers", "Def NTA. That\u2019s weird behavior from both of them. Like, dealbreaker weird. Do you work and have a separate account?", "Tell husband he can sleep in your bed or moms, but not both.", "Your husband and MIL are definitely TA but showing up and giving his mom the silent treatment isn\u2019t actually showing your husband respect. Either try for another direct conversation with them both or just don\u2019t go to his moms anymore. A day spent trying to pretend a person in the room doesn\u2019t exist will just make you miserable.", "Oh dear. You\u2019re not the ah for wanting your husband and your financial situation to be free of oversight and influence from his mother. And you\u2019re not wrong to feel the way you do about this deeply uncomfortable boundary issue.  \n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s too late now but in your shoes I would not have proceeded to have the wedding and get married until I was sure my partner and I were on the same page re goals and boundaries etc for this very reason. The oversharing and the boundary blurring  are really inappropriate to be taking place like this but you both went ahead and got married before getting this resolved. He is a mummy\u2019s boy and doesn\u2019t seem to want to cut the apron strings. He seems to value his mother\u2019s wants and opinions on this more than yours when it should be the other way round. But this is what you married and now you\u2019re having these conflicts. \n\nBoth your mother in law and your husband are ah but you have a spouse problem more than a mother in law problem. \n\nAnd you can\u2019t go to her home and then essentially blank her whilst she is providing hospitality despite your conflict. If you feel you can\u2019t engage courteously (which I understand), you\u2019re better off not going and instead spending the holidays with your side of the family or friends. Of course this course of action will certainly further lay bare the husband problem you have, because I predict him if you say to him you don\u2019t want to go, he\u2019ll go to mummy\u2019s and spend Xmas without you.", "It is super weird, and you are not the asshole.", "Your NTA, but you're missing the main problem here - your husband is tied to his mother and wants to remain so. \n\nPoints to consider: \n- he didn't make a decision himself to remove her or change accounts (weird already) \n- he didn't seem to understand when you pointed out that most adults do not have parents connected in this way \n- he asked her \"reluctantly\" for permission (WTF) rather than taking action himself, and only after you pushed him, \n- when she said no he agreed with her \n- he now wants you to go along with the status quo \n\nYour MIL isn't the issue - It's that your husband hasn't learnt to have boundaries, doesn't even want them. \n\nYou can be uncommunicative to MIL if you like but it only places you in a bad light and won't achieve any positive outcome.

MIL can take the money and you couldn't do anything.", "It's not a MIL problem at its root it's a husband problem. One that he doesn't see and won't be resolved because *he* doesn't see it as an issue.

I agree that your problem is with your husband and not your MIL, though I do feel she should be more understanding even if she still refused to disconnect the accounts.. \n\nI would urge you to not ignore her at the Christmas get together. You\u2019re married to her son and have decided to continue attending family events, therefore being distant with her will only cause more problems and prolong the tension. It really is better to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d sometimes. Telling her there are no hard feelings and treating her the same you always have will result in a much bigger chance of her rethinking how she treated you. Being distant will most likely cause her to feel defensive and double down on her \u201cI\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong\u201d way of thinking. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you have to just lay down and let your husband disrespect your wishes from now on. Try to come to an understanding with your husband if possible and take note if the disrespect continues. This could just be a specific sensitive issue or it could be a sign of more disrespect yet to come. You\u2019ll just have to give it some time to know for sure.", "This would have been a deal breaker for me, and I would have told him that until he cuts the cord, we're not getting married.\n\nNTA, but you're in for a lifetime of being second to his mother.", "Unless they have a business together, your husband shouldn\u2019t have a banking account with his mother\u2019s name on it.

Just endure another 11 years or 33 what harm has it done before?", "He\u2019s married someone just like his mother, that\u2019s how she influenced him. And even if something is weird, it\u2019s also pretty weird to get so upset over something that you struggle to articulate a real rationale over.", "I do have separate accounts from him. I'm not even asking him to put me on his personal account, I just want his disconnected from hers. The visibility is one way.", "This is something that I've been working and after this incident, I'll definitely make sure to not address her no more.", "I was trying to be more polite about how I expressed that.", "Or say because y'all are married, and his money is also your money.. And you don't really feel comfortable with her seeing y'all's finances", "I may ask that.", "My husband is petty, we spent Thanksgiving with my family. My family does a lot of spontaneous activities and he'll refuse to go if I don't go with him. I want peace in my household, I'll talk to other people there and just avoid her. They barely make efforts to get together so I won't have do this too many times. I can respectfully separate myself.", "How am I struggling to articulate a real rationale? I clearly stated that it bothers me that his account is still connect to his mom's at 28. I clearly stated that the issue with me is visibility, she can see how he spends within our household and don't forget her reminding me that she can look up my ring's price if she wants to. That visibility is one way, she can see his account, he can't see hers. This is an account that she opened for him when he was a teenager, any changes he wants to make has to go through her because it is in a way her account.  I am not asking him for access to it, I even said idk who is his beneficiary. I also told him just connect his paycheck to another individual account if he wants to keep his account connected with hers. I'm not asking to be on his account. It's been hard getting in sync financially.", "Well you're going to have to decide if this is a hill you're willing to die on. You really don't have any business telling him what to do with his account.", "Have you noticed other boundary problems? This seems like it would be the tip of an iceberg. If she knows how much is in the account, that means she's monitoring it.", "This is silly. Don\u2019t do that. And don\u2019t shun her at Christmas. This is about your husband, not her. He and you should just open a new account and get all paychecks deposited there and all bills paid from there, and transfer all money from the old account to the new one. It has nothing to do with MIL. You and he should do it.", "I got ya. I totally get wanting to maintain peace, but don\u2019t forget about your own peace. How at ease are you going to feel if this banking account stuff isn\u2019t handled? Your feelings matter too.", "I feel like I understand your reasoning. You and him are married, you share a life, etc. he does not need to be attached to his mom on something as personal as a bank account (but also in many other ways I'm sure).  He needs to \"grow up\" and detach a bit from his mom. I'm sure she loves being enmeshed with her sons, but it does need to stop. You married him, she didn't marry him...  I have to go NTA because she needs to just back off and let her sons grow up. However, I do think you have both a husband and a MIL problem because they're enmeshed and have been like this his whole life. Maybe try couples counseling? Even when there aren't big issues, it's good to help with communication etc. and also getting a third party to help him see that he needs to detach from her. You're his number 1 now, not her.", "Yeah repeating all of these things that it\u2019s not about really just serves to water down what it is about. Even if she doesn\u2019t have that visibility, he\u2019ll probably tell her if she asks. What will you do then?  And you bring up that he can\u2019t see hers - ok, so that just sounds petty. Some people have more open relationships with their parents. And I think it would be weirder for you to know what your engagement ring cost than her. And the insight isn\u2019t into your household as your bills don\u2019t come from that account. She can see his earnings, and again, I\u2019m sure he would tell her.\n\nYou sound more controlling than her.", "It is a massive red flag that dude is still connected to mommy like that.", "> It has nothing to do with MIL. You and he should do it.  \n  \nIt actually has a lot to do with nosey MIL, but its husband's responsibility to fix it.", "She was pissed off but she said that she going to disconnect it before hanging up.", "I don't care that he tells her about his finances. My husband would tell anyone who asks, so please do not add stuff. I've even mentioned that in my conversation. Reading comprehension is key, bills from his side come from that account. \n\nI've never asked and didn't care what my engagement ring cost. Financial wise whenever we make a decision or something that doesn't involve her, she gets upset. We got a house last year and she didn't fail to mention that I take her son away when if we didn't, we'd be living in a tiny apartment with her husband. \n\nHaving open relationship with your parents is cool but boundaries shouldn't be nonexistent.", "Reading comprehension is key except you stated that this is where his paychecks go and he puts money into another account for bills? Ok. Cool, I\u2019m done dealing with you, I chose not to marry a manipulative sociopath to avoid these very conversations. \n\nI\u2019d probably change my vote - I feel sorry for your husband now. Grew up being controlled and going straight into another one. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get the answer you wanted on here - the Reddit misandrists who hate their parents will see to that. But deep down you\u2019ll know you don\u2019t like her because you are her. And you probably won\u2019t even realise it until your daughter in law hates you, and probably not even then.", "I said that we have joint accounts that pay our bills. Money have to come from the account his mom has visibility on. I asked you a question because I was curious about your opinion but when you're saying I'm like her when what you back it up with is flawed. \n\nMy MIL has contacted me about my husband wearing pants that are too tight. My response he is an adult, it's not what I'd pick for him but if he likes it, I love it. She's told me to throw his things that she doesn't like away, which I have not done. I don't even open my husband's mail because he is an adult and I don't have selective boundaries.\n\nIt appears that you're biased because you love your parent but I can guarantee you that I love my parents too. My mother lives with us and none of us ever have boundary issues. She never interferes with our relationship. Where I'm from, we value our parents, our parents want us to care for them but refrain from meddling in our romantic relationship.", "So then how does get insight into your household from that account? Does he move each bill individually and label it? And even so, still doesn\u2019t explain why it\u2019s so deep. \n\nAnd so your husband has to put up with your mother 24/7 and I bet he doesn\u2019t complain as much as you do. I feel so bad for henpecked Hal. And I bet even with your mother there, he still pays more than 50% of the household bills and that\u2019s the real reason you don\u2019t want his mother seeing as everything you\u2019ve said so far sounds very much like a you problem.", "I deleted my comment because it is too much info but you brought money into this. You hate everyone and have a miserable existence so have good night.", "[deleted]"]}
