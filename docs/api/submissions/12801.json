About five months ago I completely got off them, and haven't touched them since. I've been trying to turn my life around, and feel so much more capable now that I'm sober and can see things clearly. \n\nMy sister is currently having issues with amphetamines, and seems to be running out of her month's supply way too quickly. This blame seems to have been shifted onto me, with her labelling me as the thief, apparently going and stealing her pills. I have no interest in amphetamines, and obviously did not take any of her pills, but now the family is looking at me as being the one who's stealing her pills(that she's addicted to), when I'm actively trying to disassociate myself from any sort of drugs. \n\nThis severely unnerved me and hurt me, because I'm putting in a lot of effort to turn things around while still getting blamed and framed as a thief because I was an addict in the (recent to be fair)past. I don't want to interact with my sister until she acknowledges that she's the one with the problem, not me, and apologizes. \n\nWould I be the asshole for potentially cutting off contact with her because of this?\n\nEdit: To give more info, I used to lie about my use to family members when I was an addict, so I can understand why I might still be suspected of having taken her pills. Maybe I need to do more to prove that I've turned things around, but I really am giving it my all, and am feeling better than I have in the past four years.", "created_utc": 1679356882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11x0p23/aita_for_not_wanting_to_interact_with_my_sister/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If anything can cause you to relapse or stress you to the point to relapse, you must cut it out like cancer if possible.  Your sister has her journey to take, stay on your path and maybe down the line, you guys can intersect again.", "If your sister is using, or selling, her drugs, and then knowingly blaming you for the shortage, that\u2019s wrong. Full stop. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a day clean, a month clean, a year clean, or if you\u2019ve never done drugs in your life. It\u2019s wrong.\n\nHer doing that when you **are** recovering only makes it all worse.\n\nNTA. This isn\u2019t right for your mental health and well-being, and isn\u2019t right for her health to have a scapegoat to blame for her using.", "NTA- congrats on your sobriety. Do you parents know that she has an addiction? \n\nIf I were your parents I would be concerned that you stole and were taking them, since it hasn\u2019t been long since you\u2019ve been clean. Talk to your parents to share the concern you have for your sister. \n\nStay the course OP you\u2019re doing great", "NTA - \n\nIn my opinion, you need to get out of this environment as soon as you can. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem good for you to keep up your sobriety. Good job on that, by the way. It\u2019s definitely hard. \n\nI\u2019ll be 5 years clean in August but it took me a long time to get there. Environment was a huge role. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. You said it was in your recent past that you were an addict. That means You are still probably processing and recovering from your previous addiction. You have every right to focus on your recovery and not speak to other addicts if you do not wish to. As I am sure you know, It sounds like your sister is in a heavy stage of denial right now. Lying and trying to shift blame is not uncommon for addicts ( I\u2019ve been there too) you should be focusing on you right now. Don\u2019t worry about her.", "NTA\n\nYou are justified in protecting your health and reputation", "NTA.\n\nFraming really is the adequate wording here. Your sister is blaming you for her problems. It wouldn't be unreasonable to go NC.", "NTA\n\nWhat she did was incredibly fucked up and could have put your sobriety at risk.", "NTA, and fuck that noise.  Cut out anyone that is doing something to actively threaten your self and sobriety.", "NTA \n\n\nI think it's best to separate from her during this time. You have all the right to do so.", "Nta. First of all, good for you for getting clean! That\u2019s not an easy thing and you should be proud of yourself! Second, if I were in your position, I wouldn\u2019t associate with her either till she admitted what\u2019s really going on. Totally fucked of her to just blame you since you have a history of drug abuse. Also if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t associate with the rest of that family since they seem to think it\u2019s you without any proof . Overall though, NTA.", "NTA. If she can't provide any evidence beyond suspicion then she needs to stfu. Congrats on your sobriety!", "NTA\n\nThe truth is the truth.  Look, your family has reason for not believing you off the bat but it doesn't change the fact that you aren't stealing your sister's amphetamines.  If you go NC, sister shouldn't have any more problems with her supply, right?  So cut contact.  It will only help your sobriety and it will show your family that she has a problem and you are working on your solution.", "You\u2019re NTA, but as far as your parents go, you might be expecting too much too soon. You got sober which is great! But it\u2019s only been 5 months after years of addiction and lying. Rebuilding that trust will take time.", "Sympathetically NTA - there's no winners here and you need to get away from this environment. Your sister has her own issues to deal with and you need to be able to deal with yours in the right environment....Good luck to you both, the struggle is real", "NTA. Offer to do a drug test.", "NTA Go to Target and get an at home drug test. You can get them that include opiates and amphetamines. Next time she tries to accuse you, go take a test and confront her with the negative result. \"Now, are you ready to talk about whats really going on with you? I am worried and care about you.\"", "NTA. \n\nFirst, get a test and smack the results in their faces- okay, so maybe not smack. But show them the test and get an at home drug test kit if you need to.... And then make your sister get one in front of them. \n\nBoy, I wanna know what happens next. \n\nBut yeah, do that and then get your shit and get out of there for a while until it boils down. And then you can decide whether or not you still want to initiate contact with them. \n\nBeing around an addict can be a setback for someone who just recently got sober, and that's just not healthy.\n\nCongrats on your sobriety btw!", "numerous people have given me 2nd chances and thank goodness. When someone's under the control of a regularly abused drug, their behavior can sink lower than anyone can imagine. The key is recovering from the addiction and earning trust, starting from scratch.", "NTA, not at all.  Your sister has an addiction problem that she's hiding - and blaming you for her disappearing meds!  Cutting off contact would be doing both of you a favor:  you'd be absolved because you wouldn't have access, and she'd have to acknowledge her problem.

You should be going no contact to keep yourself sober. This is not good for you.", "You can buy home tests at Walgreen's or CVS if you're in the US.  Offer to test.

You need to make that clear boundary now for your own health.", "NTA: I don't know much about addiction, so forgive my ignorance, please. Can you request a drug test to prove that you haven't been using? It there a place where the sister's pills can be locked up that you don't have access to? I know there are a lot of trust issues with addiction, so look for any ways to work on rebuilding that trust with other family members. Is there any way you can move out to get away from your sister, maybe with a different relative. \n\nI wish you luck in your recovery.", "NTA.

I've tried talking to my parents but they just see me as the lying addicted thief still.\n\nThanks for the encouragement", "I've been right where she was, and so I understand why she's shifting the blame like that, but this feeling that I can't shake my \"addict and thief\" image off no matter what I do is what really disturbs me. \n\nI'm generally really hesitant to cut off a family member, especially when they're going through a hard time, but I have my own needs too. Thank you for the things to think about", "That's understandable, and I agree, trust is something that takes a long time to rebuild. I just wish that the same treatment would be applied to my sister, who is by all means currently addicted, but always gets the benefit of the doubt.", "When we were in an argument I actually offered to do this, but she obviously declined. Since I was an addict for years I guess I have a really untrustworthy reputation, so she can easily just blame me for her issues and my parents believe her.

It's glaringly obvious.", "If they insist on seeing you as the addicted thief, then cutting off contact with your sister is probably the best thing you can do. Point out to them that, since you're no longer having anything to do with her, you *can't* be stealing her medicine... and suggest that they keep an eye on whether or not it continues disappearing just as quickly after you're out of the picture.

Just having one in your corner can make a difference. best of luck", "They are less than $20 for 5 tests. \nI only suggest it not to prove to her you arent doing drugs, but as a way of cutting past the accusations so she can face her truths like you had to.

Keep going!", "This is probably what I'll do, I think cutting her off for now is the only option I have left. This stress while I'm trying to turn my life around isn't what I need right now. Thanks for the comment", "Definitely a good idea, even though it probably won't change the way my parents see me. Thanks!", "Yeah, it wouldn't be great for anybody, and you have enough on your plate right now. Congratulations on the sobriety!!", "You can also offer to take a drug test (at their expense) proving you aren't using amphetamines. If they refuse its because they want to blame you because it's easier. Having one kid who was addicted to drugs sucks but both probably makes them feel like failures are parents. This delusion is just harming you and your sister though. They need to face reality in that both of their children struggle with addiction.", "NTA. Offer to take a drug test. You acknowledge that you can see why they wouldn't automatically believe you. Just show them you're telling them the truth.", "NTA cut her off for now. Take care of yourself and don't let anyone drag you down. You can do this. I suppose you could offer to do a drug test, but I don't know if it would help.", "NTA. Ask them to drug test both of you. If she refuses that will clue them in. If she\u2019s receiving them legally from a doctor report her for abusing them", "NTA \n\nLook man once u have stolen from someone. Which u admit u have done.

Don\u2019t do anything to endanger it, including interacting with someone who is an addict, even if it is your sister.

But you don\u2019t need to be the convenient scapegoat of your sister.", "Go to the drug store buy two test kits and offer to test the urine, they will have a hard time arguing about it with a negative result in front of them.  Obviously sisters problem is not OP\u2019s however IO has only been clean 5 mos so the suspicion is warranted, maybe the test kits will give them piece of mind and maybe they will even test sis but I wouldn\u2019t force that, it needs to be their idea to be successful", "There's an obvious middle ground here. Tell your parents you aren't stealing her meds but that you're upset by the accusation and need some time away from them. After a couple of months it'll be clear the pills are still going down too quickly, and at that point you can re-engage with your family. If they still don't want to recognise the issue and blame you, you can walk away again. If they recognise they were wrong and apologise you can decide how you want to proceed."]}
