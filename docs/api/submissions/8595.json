{"id": 8595, "submission_id": "10o7b8c", "title": "AITA For Not Correcting My Nephew When He Called Me \"Mom\"?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (32f) have a younger brother \"John\" (26m) who has a baby with his girlfriend \"Amy\" (24f). My nephew \"Junior\" (3m) who I am expected to help care for as the \"big sister\"/ aunt, and while I do love Junior I do resent my brother and Amy for always assuming that I can be an on-call babysitter and/or emotionally pressuring me into caring for Junior. Part of it has to do with when John found out that Amy was pregnant they were terrified about telling the parents, and I said that no matter what happens I'd always be there. A promise I renewed again when Junior was born prematurely and everyone was scared at the uncertainty of Junior's future.\n\nSo almost anytime that I'd complain Amy and John would throw my promise(s) back in my face, and other members of the family would chastise me for making it in the first place and to be more caution with what I say I'll do for others. I honestly have thought about going the CPS route the next time Amy or John just dropped Junior off at my door, but I'm too scared at how this would effect Junior and never go through. Something Amy and John know and count on. I'm also one of the few people that Junior really responds well too because he's literally seen me almost everyday of his life so other relatives use that excuse too.\n\nBecause I work, Amy and John had to put Junior in a daycare, and he was having a hard time. More than once the daycare workers had to call in order to try and get Junior to calm down but when John or Amy didn't pick up I would be the next person they'd ring. I actually work close to where Junior's daycare was and have stopped by on my lunch break with spend time with him, and it's really helped. I'm also the one who almost always picks him up at the end of the day.\n\nThis has led to other people thinking that I am Junior's mom and I'm honestly too tired to correct them when they address me as such. Junior has now developed the habit of calling me \"mama.\" This all came to a head on Saturday when Amy and John took Junior to a gathering on her side of the family and started calling Amy by her name and when he asked for his \"mama\" he meant me. He told everyone that he didn't like living with Amy because she doesn't make \"dinnycakes\" (dinosaur shaped pancakes), doesn't put him to bed right, that I give better hugs, doesn't color with him, etc.. Amy was humiliated and pissed off at me and thinks that I'm turning her son against her. John and Amy demand that I give a public apology and correct Junior whenever he calls me \"mama.\"\n\nI was so angry that I refused and told them that if they wanted Junior too see Amy as his mom then she needed to act like it and stop leaving him with me to take care of. AITA?\n\nETA: Because someone made a comment about it and I just wanted to be clear \"3m\" means \"3 year old male\".\n\nETA 2: Because someone asked in the DM I'll list a few more things that I do for Junior and/or make others feel as if I'm his mom instead of Amy\n\n1. Junior is biracial and he takes after John a lot and John and I look a like each other so Junior looks more like me than Amy.\n2. While Amy or John get Junior ready in the morning and drop him off at daycare 3/5 of the week I pick him because my job isn't too far from where the daycare is.\n3. I'm pretty introverted so that another reason why my family doesn't see Amy and John leaving Junior with me a lot since \"I never go out.\"\n4. When I have Junior on weekends I make dinnycakes, we'll watch cartoons, I'll take him to the local park to run around, he likes to color so we'll color in coloring books, I help teach him his numbers and letters, taught him how to brush his teeth properly, he and I will cuddle for nap time, etc..\n5. Also, I'm a bathe everyday type of person so I bathe Junior and now he thinks he's supposed to bathe everyday and when he was with Amy's family he told them that she \"let's him be stinky.\"", "created_utc": 1674997847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o7b8c/aita_for_not_correcting_my_nephew_when_he_called/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids go through phases where they call parents by what the hear other people call them - their name. Amy should correct that if she wants to be called mama.  You should probably correct your nephew when he does call you mama, just to avoid confusing other adults. But you don\u2019t owe anyone an apology.\n\nETA: maybe try teaching him to call you \u201cmama [yourname]\u201d as a compromise with his poor little brain", "NTA.\n\n>I said no matter what happens I\u2019d always be there\n\nJohn and Amy took this too heart and took this way too literally. That being said, you\u2019re more of a parent to Junior than both of them combined. It isn\u2019t your fault that both of them are (somewhat) absent in their kid's life. \n\nAmy expects you to correct Junior? No, maybe is she and John ACTUALLY be parents to Junior then yeah but until then, they have no right to get upset with you for not correcting him", "NTA. They aren\u2019t making efforts to bond with him. They push you to do THEIR responsibilities which I think is unfair. They are taking advantage and gaslight you by throwing in your promise. They need to understand that you being there for them does not mean that they could make use of your time and energy whenever they wanted. They\u2019re acting more like junior\u2019s aunt and uncle rather than the other wY round. You\u2019re being considerate but they\u2019re taking advantage of you", "NTA, not even close. They\u2019re abusing the privilege of having a very loyal sister. You probably should have put up more boundaries to the promise, but hindsight is 20/20. Junior calling you mom is the chickens coming home to roost in Amy\u2019s hen house of lack luster parenting. If she want to be \u201cmama\u201d instead of \u201cAmy\u201d, then she should act in a way that earns her that title.", "NTA. how does she expect her son to call her \"mom\" if she doesn't act like one? the one who deserves a public apology is you. By the way, don't apologize, they will be proud enough not to leave junior with you during that time, that is of course if they don't want contact until you apologize.", "INFO: why are Amy and John so dependent on you for babysitting? Is it the hours they work or are they unable to care for Junior?", "NTA and I how this has embarrassed Amy enough that she takes a greater role in parenting him.", "NTA. \u201cYou guys are right. I\u2019m sorry. Also, I\u2019m rescinding my promise to always be there. I\u2019ll be there, but not always. And will certainly not be answering calls from or stopping by daycare anymore.  This should all help Junior get things in order.\u201d", "NTA, you can\u2019t help how others perceive you, especially not the child. But, for the child\u2019s sake I would try to make things clear for them. For yours and the parents\u2019 sake you need to all sit down and discuss a schedule/ future plan, so that you don\u2019t feel used and they don\u2019t feel like their child doesn\u2019t like them. You could spend more time with the parents and the child together, showing them how to do the things the child likes and establishing a more shared approach to child rearing. \n\nI think your family is right about making promises you can\u2019t keep, but that\u2019s obviously being taken advantage of. \n\nIf they really can\u2019t handle looking after their child, maybe you should petition for shared custody?", "NTA you act like a parent, that'sthe result. This might make them depend on you less and actually parent him. Or you need to cut contact for a while, like don't pick up the phone from school unless it rings like 5 times or don't open the door when they come to drop him off at your place without notice. When they call and ask for babysitting tell them you are not at home and won't be back till later...", "NTA. But your family are. To ring your doorbell and leave their child there when you\u2019ve told them you\u2019re not watching their kid is horrific.\n\nTelling someone you\u2019ll always be there does not mean that every time your brother and his wife want to go out or want something from you that you have to comply. It is not up to you to raise their child!!!\n\nThis is insane. OP this is so much more than this child calling you mom. Literally you are parenting your nephew because you were a supportive sister and being guilted into it. \n\nYou have every right to help out however you want but they\u2019ve railroaded you and the rest of your family is okay with it likely because it keeps Junior out of their hair or because your bro is the golden child.\n\nTell them you need to step back from all the things you\u2019ve been doing because you\u2019re burnt out. Tell them they need to take a more active role and plan for their child\u2019s care. Tell them you are ceasing all help in two weeks time and if they push back tell them it\u2019s done now. Then call CPS and ask them to check things out in a few days time explaining the situation. Worst comes to worse he\u2019ll be taken from their care and you can step up and raise Junior if you choose to.", "NTA- the only way to fix that is for them to correct it by not having you on call. You do not owe her an apology of any kind because you have done nothing wrong. Yes, you should be correcting him when he calls you, Mama. If she wants to nip that she needs to step up more.", "NTA -  of course. as you said, if Amy wants the title of mama, she needs to act the part", "INFO: You mentioned considering CPS - would you be ok elaborating a bit about what makes you feel that way? (Not saying you're wrong - I agree, it sounds as if they're emotionally neglecting him at least. But more context and insight would be appreciated if comfortable.)\n\nOthers have pointed out great ways to handle this (like teaching him to call you \"Mama \\[YourName\\]\"), but I feel like his safety being at a point where CPS is considered is important.", "NTA. You are basically his mama, and no shame on the kid for speaking the truth.", "Let me first start off by saying NTA.  \n  \nSecondly, LMAOOOOOO. This is perfect and in front of family. Kids don't lie and this is more of a wake up call than CPS.", "NTA, it should be corrected but by Amy and John stepping up", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do you want your brother and his GF to step up? Or have they fallen to far?, since they have literally been abandoning their child on your doorstep and even you admit you have him near daily, your only dragging things out by not putting your foot down for your nephew. Cops and cps will be on your side after you've shown how much you've cared for him you've got receipts, witnesses and even video from the daycare that YOU ARE HIS MOM at this point, not his mother since you didn't give birth but you are mom.

You don't owe anyone an apology for what a 3-year-old says.
