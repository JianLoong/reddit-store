She is always getting invited to somebody's house for a party. She doesn't have her a car so I usually end up dropping her off and picking her up from parties. My mother is in the hospital and I can tell that my time with her is limited. My girlfriend visited some friends for a New Year's party and I promised to pick her up. Around 20 minutes before the party my sister frantically called me about our mother. My mother was asking to see me so I dropped everything and went to be with her. I texted my girlfriend that I would not be able to pick her up and she did not answer. My sister and I enjoyed some quality time with our mother and it was wonderful. I assumed my girlfriend would be able to carpool with her bestfriend who also attended. My girlfriend was waiting for me at home and she was very upset with me. She told me that I abandoned her when she needed me. She says that I should have called rather than texting because it would ensure I knew about the change in plans. She is giving me the cold shoulder and honestly I don't understand why. She knew about the urgency with my mom.

Worst part is, you had to even ask if you were the asshole. \n\nYour mother is dying, and your girlfriend is mature enough to go out and party fucking wild. Your girlfriend is also mature enough to figure out her own ways to get to and from somewhere.\n\nEnjoy the time left with your mom, stop playing Taxi for your gf", "NTA. Tell her she's grown up so she should get her own licence and a car. You're not her butler", "Your partner wasn't there to support you while your mother is in hospital. Instead she prioritized a party and depended on you to give her a ride. Why are you still with her? What's the point of being in a relationship?\n\nNTA, but you'd be TA to yourself if you continue to date her.", "NTA, is she banned by uber and such? She can call a cab, carpool or just miss the party. Party is not an emergency", "NTA.\n\nYou had an emergency. Even if it was not the case, you're not a private driver for your GF.", "NTA - you let her know, its 2023, a text is fine. Youre also not her chauffeur.", "NTA. You texted her and told her the change in plans. The fact that she is giving you a cold shoulder and partying while your mother is seriously ill should cause you to look at this relationship closely as to whether or not she is a good partner otherwise.", "NTA, but your gf certainly is.", "NTA - nothing you did is wrong. Your mom comes first, especially in her circumstances. Tell your freeloader GF to get a car or use Uber/Lyft like the rest of us. Also you and her don\u2019t sound very compatible if she just uses you for rides all the time to party with other people.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is being incredibly selfish by even assuming you would be providing her transportation to parties while your mother is in the hospital. I would tell her to kick rocks.", "NTA.\n\nYou informed you girlfriend and she\u2018s her own person and hence should be able to mind her own business.\n\nHer partying is her problem, and she should be more compassionate towards you and your mother.", "NTA.  \nWhy cant she call a taxi?", "You are being taken advantage of. You are all give and ? in return. She doesn't seem like a caring or giving girl friend.  You can do much better than this. Try some one nice next time. They're out there.", "NTA you have your priorities right. Your girlfriend is just selfish and she can't expect you to be going above and beyond for her when your focus was elsewhere due to an emergency.\n\nYour title is misleading though. I thought I'd be  reading about a girl stranded at a party, which would have been different.", "NTA\n\nYour gf sounds like she enjoys having you as her personal Uber driver. I hope she at least tips well.\n\n\"Abandoned her when she needed you most\" - WTF so dramatic! You left to visit your sick and possibly dying mother.\n\nEdited to add: if she really cared she'd blow off the party to come support you. Losing a parent is one of the toughest things that you can go through, and you only have one mother. But there will always be another party.", "Wait?  You abandoned her when she needed you?   \n\nIt was a party. Your mom\u2019s health is declining. I think she abandoned you!!!  \n\nNTA, but think about a future with this level of selfishness", "NTA - your girlfriend partying isn\u2019t a priority over sick family. She needs to grow up. If she wants to party, have her get an Uber or her own car.", "NTA. Your gf is a selfish piece of work. Imagine the worst had happened, and you were otherwise engaged, because gf had a transport problem? I don't think she's the right gf for you.", "10000% NTA!!!! OP that is some toxic behavior on your gf part tbh. If there is a chance you will lose your mother she has no right to dictate this time you have with her. She needs to be more understanding. I'm glad you went to see your mother because if anything was to happen your relationship would have never recover. I think this requires a serious conversation with your girlfriend because something isn't right there and you don't need this extra stress while your mother is sick.\n\nAside from all that, I'm assuming your girlfriend is old enough to figure out her own travel arrangements. Cabs do exist even on new years and failing that if she told her friends the situation any decent friend would try to help. This screams of control issues.", "Your girlfriend needs to learn how convenient Uber and Lyft are as back ups. I wonder how someone who hates parties and someone who loves parties work as a couple. That's generally very different people. And it seems to not be working. NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut that's definitely a red flag in my book. Not only do you drive her without any issue.. You also would pick her up if you could.. Every. Single. Time. She has a damn party? \n\nShe sounds entitled and it's horrific, if she has such an issue with it, get your own car..", "NTA and dump the girlfriend. Find someone who is compatible with you, is compassionate and doesn't use you as a chauffeur. This isn't 1993 and uber/lyft exists.", "(I don't know your age or gender, but I'm going to assume) but you appear to have become taxi dad before you've even had kids.  \n\nNTA. Your girlfriend is an adult and needs to start being responsible for herself. She also needs to learn empathy and understanding.", "Nah- she's not wrong though, you should have called. If someone is depending on you for something you make sure they got the info.", "NTA, by your ex-girlfriend sure is. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. She knew your mom was in the hospital, & you also sent her a text. It's not your fault she didn't bother to check her phone at any point, & she honestly seems really ungrateful. What will she do if you stop chauffeuring her entirely?", "NTA. When you're relying on someone else for a ride, you should always have a backup plan or at least answer your messages. Not your problem.", "NTA to the highest degree. This was an emergency and if she was waiting for you she could have just checked or called you. If she isn\u2019t showing you care and worried with you, that is something you need to decide if it\u2019s a problem.", "I hate posts like this where so many things don't seem to add up.\n\nINFO:  So you drop GF off and pick her up from parties and you sister called you frantically (why was it a frantic call?  frantic calls don't generally lead to wonderful hospital visits.) 20 minutes before the party...  how did those times not overlap such that your GF was there when sis called?  \n\nAnd like didn't you and your GF call each other at or around midnight to wish each other a happy new year?  You made a single text that didn't get answered and there was no additional check-ins as the time for pickup got closer?  And your GF didn't call or text you when it appeared you were late?  \n\nHow long was the party vs how long was you visit with mom?  A midnight into the wee hours visit in a hospital is weird.  Been there\\\\done that...  but it was less a visit and more a bed side vigil as the person slept and i slept in a chair next to them?  My experience is that hospitals don't like activity late at night that could disturb other patients?", "YTA for not *calling* your gf and actually speaking with her to let her know she had to figure out her own way home.  You were not an AH for choosing to visit with your mother in the hospital till after midnight  when she was lucid and capable of interacting with her children and enjoying their company but you could have potentially stranded your gf who was relying on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The OP in this post is an *unreliable narrator*, imho, trying to make himself look good after not bothering to pick his gf up as planned after a NYE party.  At no point does he say his mother is actively dying, on her deathbed or in hospice care in the hospital. He just says he knows his time with her is limited \u2014 hey, all our time is \u201climited\u201d\u2014 might be 2 days or 20 years. OP didn\u2019t go see his [poor, sick] mother till his sister called and said his ma wanted to see him. To see in the NY, to watch the Big Peach come down, whatever.  Heartstrings pulled.  Even him saying his sister \u201ccalled frantically\u201d doesn\u2019t say mum was in bad shape and desperate. Could have just meant \u2018mom is raising hell because you haven\u2019t been to see her today and it\u2019s a Saturday.\u2019"]}
