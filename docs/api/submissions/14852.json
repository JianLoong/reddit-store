We\u2019re on the way home from picking kid up at daycare. It\u2019s like 4:30PM, sun is out, weather is nice. We have the windows down. Traffic is moderate. \n\nThere\u2019s a spot on our drive where the road is one lane in each direction, then it widens for a left turn lane in the middle. I was moving to that lane to turn left. I can see the light ahead has just turned red a moment ago, so I\u2019m in no rush to get there and I\u2019m slowly rolling toward the red light. As I\u2019m doing this, a guy in a GMC pickup truck behind me starts honking his horn. \n\nI look behind me and I can see it\u2019s a boomer aged man driving alone and he looks angry. The light did not turn green before I arrived, so I briefly had to stop at the red light. At this point, the guy rolls his window down and yells \u201cpull over!\u201d At first I thought there must be an ambulance coming or something, but there was nothing behind him. I don\u2019t pull over and the GMC driver honks again.\n\nBecause this is my usual drive home, I know that if I keep driving for about half a mile past this red light I\u2019m going to pass a police station. So when the light turns green, I turn left, and half a mile later I pull into the police station parking lot. The GMC driver flips me off and continues driving past it. I wait in that lot for a few minutes, then go home. \n\nNow my wife and I are fighting because she says I handled this wrong. She thinks the truck guy might have been in some kind of trouble and needed help, or he noticed something wrong with our car and was trying to tell us about it and I made him angry by ignoring him. She also thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I \u201cescalated the situation\u201d by \u201cgetting the police involved\u201d because \u201csomeone could have gotten shot\u201d. I\u2019m of the opinion that my responsibility here is to keep my family safe first, and stopping to talk to people who are obviously road raging is the opposite of that.

They said they didn't want to hurt him since he was so old. He asked if they'd frisked him and again no because he was just an old man.

He was mad that you were following the law and wanted to do something dumb. If he needed help or was hurt he would\u2019ve followed you into the police station not drive off flipping you off.

Pulling into the police station ended the engagement, which is what needed to happen. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIf he was in trouble, he would\u2019ve pulled in with you at the police station. And plus, is your wife completely oblivious to what\u2019s going on nowadays? You did the right thing by protecting you and yours.", "No, no way, never would I pull over because an angry man in a truck with unknown intentions told me to!

I mean I'm mostly joking but at the same it really is just that weird to me, especially after that tesla road rage guy was all over the news not long ago", "NTA your wife is stupid and naive he probably wanted to shoot you so he could rape her and did you look over your vehicle and find anything wrong assuming you checked it", "You're not an asshole for not pulling over. That guy was being ridiculous. That being said, the slow roll to the light is annoying. Please stop doing that. You are forcing everyone behind you to roll slowly instead of just getting up to the light and stopping. You were being annoying.", "NTA.\n\nBut . . . \n\nSo, if I understand your story, you were driving way slower than you normally would, way slower than the flow of normal traffic, when this guy approached you from behind. From his perspective , you were driving along at a slow crawl, most likely indicating you had a mechanical problem or simply were clogging up traffic for no reason.\n\nHe immediately got angry and honked angrily at you. That makes him the asshole, but only if the honk was not a quick honk. He lacked the insight, experience, and/or  perspective to understand the context of your slow driving, I.e. that the light had just turned red and you were essentially coasting forward. His lack of perspective for your deviant driving doesn\u2019t make him the asshole. \n\nHim yelling at you to pull over was also assholish, but barely. He should have waited til after the turn to see if you were still going unnaturally slowly and to see if he could pass you safely.\n\nHim  flipping you off at the police station was assholish because the dumb mofo should have figured out the situation by this point as long as you were traveling at a normal rate of speed between the light and the police station. \n\nSo while I say NTA, I disagree that you did everything perfect. A 100% defensive driver would have sped up as soon as you saw him behind you. His anger was inappropriate because he misread the situation and then road raged because of it, not because he randomly road raged. This is a nuanced take, which Reddit doesn\u2019t like, but I think the point is worth naking:\n\nYou're ethically in the clear. But as a matter of risk management, you failed a little in the beginning.", "I don't believe this post. Every detail. The birds were singing. I could see the light in the distance.

Yes, he says he was \"slowly rolling\" to the red light (without any indication of how slow compared to the rest of traffic), which-depending on the actual speed limit of the road, when he started slowing down so he could properly stop at the light, etc-could have been well within driving regulations. You are supposed to start slowing down when you see a red light, partly to ensure you adequately stop at the right place and partly bc a sudden stomp on the brakes can damage your car over time and endanger other drivers on the road. \n\n>From his perspective , you were driving along at a slow crawl, most likely indicating you had a mechanical problem or simply were clogging up traffic for no reason.\n\nThere's literally no indication of exactly how slow OP was going, certainly not enough to confidently call it a slow crawl. I highly doubt if OP was going *that* slow, he wouldn't see where he was wrong for driving that way. Saying he was in no rush does not mean he was going, like, 10 mph or something. Slowing for red lights is incredibly common, especially if there *are* other cars ahead of you who may also be slowing down or about to stop. \n\n>His lack of perspective for your deviant driving doesn\u2019t make him the asshole. \n\nSlowing down for a traffic light is not deviant driving, it's exactly what you're supposed to do! [Driver safety courses encourage slowing down](https://safety1stdriversed.com/2015/02/importance-slowing-down-intersections/) as a safety precaution.  Are you telling me you don't slow down and instead just slam on the brake to stop behind the line or other cars? Bc if so, that's incredibly reckless, both to all the drivers around and your car. \n\n>I disagree that you did everything perfect.
