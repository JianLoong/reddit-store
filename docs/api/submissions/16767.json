The husband should understand that you didn't know there would be a child's note attached to the gift. If he feels undercut by your thoughtfulness, that tells me he knows he should be doing more for his wife.

Not agreeing but I could see it as a reasonable response for some people.

You did a lovely thing for your friend and I'm sure she appreciates it. A friend of mine recently had a baby and I sent her a huge package of things I knitted and crocheted for the little one, but half the package was also made up of things for my friend and her favourite tea etc. I think a big part of PPD is feeling like you don't exist as anything other than a provider. I'll never forget going to a friend's house a few years back, maybe a week after she'd had a baby. I walked in the door and hung up my coat and she burst into tears and said \"thank god you're here\", handed me the baby and went to get in the shower. She hadn't been able to wash herself for a week because that simple basic human need had been overwhelmed by other things considered more urgent. I think of that moment often and make a special point now of checking in with the new mums in my friend group to make sure they're actually having their basic human needs met.", "NTA.\n\nYou were kind, thoughtful, and considerate to your friend.

My guess is he wasn\u2019t going to do anything and now feel obligated.", "NTA, if he wasn\u2019t already thinking he wasn\u2019t doing enough for his wife, something as small as a little note on her gift wouldn\u2019t have bothered him so much.", "NTA that's so weird the only thing I can think of is they didn't get anything for their wife and are worried you're making them look bad,  which is their problem not yours!", "NTA \n\nI cannot roll my eyes enough at this douchbag getting upset at his wife, the mother of his child, getting a gift, no matter who it was from!!!\n\nIf this had happened to me, I know my husband would have made a joke about not knowing my best friend had come out of my hoo haa, or something else!!! Then he\u2019d have been buzzing for me to get a treat for myself.", "You're NTA, the husband.\n\nLike you mentioned, this is in no form a competition yet he's acting like it is.

While she sits in the other room crying.\n\nI may be going a little overboard but this whole situation just hits close to home with me.", "I thought that too!

Mother's day isn't until Sunday.", "I've been in a similar situation, and let me just say, however het you are, you can be a threat to a marriage.\n\nMy best friend was married to a guy that, well, sucked. He weaponised incompetence to nuclear levels and made promises of changing/stepping up that never came to be. It got worse when they got married and had a baby, but by that time I'd gone to uni (at 27), and wasn't around as much.\n\nWhich, in hindsight, is probably one of the reasons he felt secure in being an even worse husband. Because before, I lived with them. I'd do things for my best friend - gifts, making her food/drinks, splitting 'their share' of the housework with her - and he almost never did. He looked terrible by comparison, but I refused to stop doting on my best friend (he did ask me to, more than once) so he'd look better by contrast. Eventually, he resorted to lying about who'd done certain bits of housework, taking credit for my actions, trying to claw back any semblance of seeming like a caring partner. It wasn't until I'd moved out that my best friend realised the extent of his lies, and how much she'd been making excuses for him. It took longer for her to leave him, and I was so proud of her for doing it when she had a newborn baby and a full-time job (he never kept a job longer than 3 months).\n\nAnyway, to summarise; by existing, and loving your friend the way she deserves to be loved, you're undermining him and threatening their marriage.
