I'll never forget going to a friend's house a few years back, maybe a week after she'd had a baby. I walked in the door and hung up my coat and she burst into tears and said \"thank god you're here\", handed me the baby and went to get in the shower.

It got worse when they got married and had a baby, but by that time I'd gone to uni (at 27), and wasn't around as much.\n\nWhich, in hindsight, is probably one of the reasons he felt secure in being an even worse husband. Because before, I lived with them. I'd do things for my best friend - gifts, making her food/drinks, splitting 'their share' of the housework with her - and he almost never did. He looked terrible by comparison, but I refused to stop doting on my best friend (he did ask me to, more than once) so he'd look better by contrast. Eventually, he resorted to lying about who'd done certain bits of housework, taking credit for my actions, trying to claw back any semblance of seeming like a caring partner. It wasn't until I'd moved out that my best friend realised the extent of his lies, and how much she'd been making excuses for him. It took longer for her to leave him, and I was so proud of her for doing it when she had a newborn baby and a full-time job (he never kept a job longer than 3 months).\n\nAnyway, to summarise; by existing, and loving your friend the way she deserves to be loved, you're undermining him and threatening their marriage.

If one partner decides to cheat then their decision to cheat is a threat to the marriage. If one partner is an asshole and a friend helps the other leave, the asshole is the threat to the marriage. The whole idea of \"homewreckers\" puts the responsibility off the person that's cheating onto the person they're cheating with, and that's not okay.

I don't celebrate it either but i get and give gifts around the year, plus the Christmas/birthday ones.\n\nSo again - why would he be upset?\n\nAny gift from my husband will have a higher value in my heart than a friend's.

My husband and I make a big deal about taking the kids shopping for each other for mothers/fathers day and other holidays. We pick something out when the child in question is too young. It\u2019s an important thing to us so I get being mildly disappointed the gift was labeled from the child. This alone wouldn\u2019t make someone an a-hole at all in my opinion. \n\nThat said- if you said \u201coh, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize that!\u201d It would be an honest mistake and he should get over it. \n\nWhat\u2019s MORE concerning is this comment and the fact you felt the need to include all of the backstory/details that have little bearing on the actual question about your present. These details do show he\u2019s an AH in general. It may be a reach to assume he wouldn\u2019t get her presents on his own. But saying she\u2019s not your mom is weird. Complaining about a gift given to his wife is ungrateful and rude. Not brushing off your mistake once it was explained is wrong. Not being an involved father and being there for his wife is why he\u2019s the AH. \n\nI am also concerned for your friend and baby. Maybe I am reading into it, but there seems to be a lot of negative thoughts towards this child. I get that you can feel like you lose your identity when you become a mom, and that may be normal to an extent, but coming to the conclusion you \u201clost your birthday\u201d because your baby is born in the same week is a bit worrisome. She has a team of support (friend/family moving in) but is struggling so badly.  I am not one to jump to therapy for the solution to everything but this is one of those cases where I think that\u2019s where this needs to go. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA but this issue seems like it\u2019s a bit above reddits pay grade.", "Nope you were SO RIGHT and such a great friend", "He wasn\u2019t mad that she got her a gift did you even read the fucking post before you start throwing shade at a guy you don\u2019t know", "Lots of new moms can feel unloved.

Then we turned a corner. \nI hope that happens for your friend AND her husband. Understand that you\u2019re probably the easiest person for him to get mad at in this situation. You getting a gift that looked like it was from baby was just one more thing he did wrong. (Look at all the people saying he\u2019s mad because now he has to get something.

When he protests, say, \"but that's what you made me do. Aren't you as capable as I am?\"", "Same, same. Burst into ugly post partum tears and crud out that *I was the mother of his children!*", "I didn't say it actually happened, I was giving a scenario about a situation that I've seen happen too many times. I'm not actually saying that he did what I said, just giving another opinion on why he did it.\n\nNo one on reddit has any REAL idea on why the OP's husband did this so all we can do is speculate.", "I don't think it's bad form to buy a present for the person who just gave birth? \nI've been doing it (considering babies are getting all the attention..).", "My very first Mother\u2019s Day is this year and honestly that\u2019s about what I\u2019m expecting \ud83d\ude43", "`he's mad because OP showed up...` \n\nYou directly said it happened. \n\nI understand that you're just attributing another scenario onto this story, but you are literally making up the outcome and projecting it onto the OP's friend and her husband. Realistically OP gives *very little* information about the dynamic of her friend's relationship. \n\nShe says the friend's husband doesn't understand what she is going through but doesn't go into any details, and people in this entire thread are treating him like a deadbeat. There is absolutely no information to say whether he is a good father, or simply an inexperienced father, or whether he is working 23 hours per day to provide for his family (hence both sets of mothers moving in to help out). It's hard to judge him with zero information.\n\nThe actual conflict for this story is \"your gift to my wife implies it came from my child and undermines my position as my first and only child's father on me and my wife's first mothers day ever\". I don't think that's an unreasonable thing for him to be upset about.", "Don\u2019t have expectations and spoil yourself. No shame in planning something for yourself that you will enjoy.", "Right, like it even arrived early so he had notice! He should've been all oh you think that's great? Well wait till Sunday & blown ope out of the water, instead he did even rise to mediocrity", "The only time I've ever been able to believe a scratch-off could be a good gift", "I used to do them with my dad as a kid before he died, and they're super sentimental to me. he taught me how to appropriately gamble, check the odds, etc and then we'd save up the winners until we had enough to go to Friendly's. and he used to always talk about the time I got one for him on father's day and he won $500 :) once in awhile my mom, brother, or chosen dad will get me one in honour of my dad, and I love it."]}
