She had a rough childbirth and was bedridden for several weeks after. Her mom and in laws have moved in with them or close by to help with childcare. But she has been complaining about feeling emotionally neglected and underappreciated. Everyone is focused on the \"precious\" baby and she feels like her only worth is that of the cow that produces its milk. She might be slipping into ppd (undiagnosed). Her husband helps a bit with childcare but it's a flip of a coin if he'll show up for her emotionally. For the most part he hasn't. He just doesn't get what she has been through and is going through. \n\nThis weekend, I ordered a mother's day self care package for my mom and had an extra one shipped to my friend. I added a gift note thanking her for giving me the world's cutest godchild and for everything she has done for us. It was meant to be a gift from me - her friend - to celebrate her new journey as a mom. \n\nThe gift was delivered early. She was very happy to receive it. She knew it was from me. \n\nBut here's the problem - the gift box apparently had a message printed on it from a child to its mother (thank you mom or I love you mom or something similar). Her husband saw it and texted me telling me it was not cool that I bought a gift for his wife on his child's behalf without consulting him. Buying a gift on his baby's behalf was his right. I clarified that the gift was from me, and this was not a competition. He could get her gifts on his behalf and on the baby's behalf on Sunday. \n\nAnd I said I hadn't zoomed in on the picture of the box to read the message printed on it when I was ordering it online. But he wasn't having it. He said it was an asshole move meant to undercut him.

Her husband sounds awful.  \"Helps out with the childcare a bit\"?  Yikes.  A 50/50 shot on him caring about her feelings or not?  And taking a gift to his wife as some kind of slight against him??  I know new parenthood is hard on both parties but honestly dude just sounds like an AH.", "NTA- translation: I didn\u2019t think to get her a Mother\u2019s Day gift (because she\u2019s not MY mom). Now I have to get something or I\u2019ll look like more of an idiot.", "NTA - I don't know why the husband feels this is something for him to control. It's a bit concerning, to say the least. I hope your friend is safe, is there any way you can check on her discretely?", "NTA. You are a great friend.", "NTA. Your message was clearly from you to her, not from the child to her. Her husband should stop making this about him and start caring for his wife a bit more.", "NTA, it wasn't intentional.", "Info: are you male or female that could be a difference in how he saw it", "NTA - he needs to get over himself", "NTA. Hopefully your friend soon realises she deserves better than this man who's more emotionally invested in what a giftbox says than he is in his wife who created a child for them.", "NAH\n\nYou didn't do it intentionally so you're not the AH. He feels you undermined him and is reacting to that, so he isn't the AH. He may be feeling massively insecure about his ability to be a good father. He may feel he is in way over his head and has no idea what to do. He may not have had a good role model in his own father for what being a good dad should look like. He may be doing his best, fucking it up and not having a clue how to fix it. His MiL AND his family (you don't say which ones) have moved in with them or close by to help out and he may be feeling really cut off from the parenting experience. \n\nYour friend's experience is pretty much my universal observation of new mothers, they're the incubator and care provider for their children, they almost no longer exist as a person themselves as everyone focuses on the baby and only talks to them about the baby or how they're finding being a mother. She's lucky to have a friend like you who is still continuing to see her as an individual and not just 'a mother'.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s just taking it out on you.", "He probably didn't have a gift ready and knows you gave a better one than he would have. His reaction is totally weird. Even if you did mean it as a \"gift from her child\", what's wrong with multiple gifts from her child? \n\nNTA", "Jeez this guy sets the bar low and fights to keep it there. I\u2019m glad your bestie has someone (you) to love on her! NTA", "NTA. Her husband is being insecure about a gift.", "NTA. \n\nHe only feels this way because he knows he's a shitty husband and needs to step up his game.", "NTA\nwhat you did for your friend was really sweet, it is not your fault the box comes with a generic message. You added your own card with a message for your friend and that should have been enough. He needs to get over himself.", "NTA. We've all had things go wrong with online orders. The husband should understand that you didn't know there would be a child's note attached to the gift. If he feels undercut by your thoughtfulness, that tells me he knows he should be doing more for his wife. Not your problem.\n\nIf your friend is showing signs of PPD, please encourage her to tell her doctor or midwife about what she is experiencing.

Did he bother to read the note enclosed?", "NTA", "NTA and your friend's husband is, quite frankly, a moron", "He probably didn\u2019t think about getting presents so he is pestering you about your thoughtful gift. Absolutely NTA. Instead of being an asshole to you he should be giving your friend all the supports she needs.", "NTA. The husband is a jerk.", "NTA you were being there for your friend, making her feel special in a time where she feels like nothing and so this was very important for her and her husband just sounds useless to me.", "Was going to comment exactly the same thing.

He said that she's not my mom so why am I giving her a gift, if not on behalf of her child. His child should be the one to give her a gift and it's for him to make that decision on his child's behalf. He doesn't understand that mother's day is to celebrate all mothers and not just your own mother.", "She's safe. Her mom and sister have been living with them since the birth.

He wasn't a shit partner to her before this. But he's not handling this change in their relationship too well.", "Bingo. His deliberate incompetence has just been shown up, can\u2019t have that! \n\nIf she\u2019s feeling that down, but has helpers who can watch baby for a bit, can you gently push her to get an appointment to be screened for PPD? I know when I\u2019m depressed or overwhelmed the last thing I can handle is making medical appointments by myself, so even offering to sit with her while she makes it might be lifesaving.", "I would hope he didn't need your a gift to push him to get one for the mother of his child", "That's good to hear. Hopefully he'll decide to step up and be a productive dad", "NTA if you were a close male friend I could see him thinking it an inappropriate gift... Not agreeing but I could see it as a reasonable response for some people. But for a female friend he shouldn't care, I'd be happy and be sure to tell her me and the kids would be fine while she gets some time for herself and I could even take a sick day whenever she decided that she wanted to go"]}
