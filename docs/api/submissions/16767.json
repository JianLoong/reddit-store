A friend of mine recently had a baby and I sent her a huge package of things I knitted and crocheted for the little one, but half the package was also made up of things for my friend and her favourite tea etc. I think a big part of PPD is feeling like you don't exist as anything other than a provider. I'll never forget going to a friend's house a few years back, maybe a week after she'd had a baby. I walked in the door and hung up my coat and she burst into tears and said \"thank god you're here\", handed me the baby and went to get in the shower. She hadn't been able to wash herself for a week because that simple basic human need had been overwhelmed by other things considered more urgent.

He weaponised incompetence to nuclear levels and made promises of changing/stepping up that never came to be. It got worse when they got married and had a baby, but by that time I'd gone to uni (at 27), and wasn't around as much.\n\nWhich, in hindsight, is probably one of the reasons he felt secure in being an even worse husband. Because before, I lived with them. I'd do things for my best friend - gifts, making her food/drinks, splitting 'their share' of the housework with her - and he almost never did. He looked terrible by comparison, but I refused to stop doting on my best friend (he did ask me to, more than once) so he'd look better by contrast. Eventually, he resorted to lying about who'd done certain bits of housework, taking credit for my actions, trying to claw back any semblance of seeming like a caring partner. It wasn't until I'd moved out that my best friend realised the extent of his lies, and how much she'd been making excuses for him. It took longer for her to leave him, and I was so proud of her for doing it when she had a newborn baby and a full-time job (he never kept a job longer than 3 months).\n\nAnyway, to summarise; by existing, and loving your friend the way she deserves to be loved, you're undermining him and threatening their marriage.

If one partner decides to cheat then their decision to cheat is a threat to the marriage. If one partner is an asshole and a friend helps the other leave, the asshole is the threat to the marriage. The whole idea of \"homewreckers\" puts the responsibility off the person that's cheating onto the person they're cheating with, and that's not okay.
