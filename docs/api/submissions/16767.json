A friend of mine recently had a baby and I sent her a huge package of things I knitted and crocheted for the little one, but half the package was also made up of things for my friend and her favourite tea etc. I think a big part of PPD is feeling like you don't exist as anything other than a provider. I'll never forget going to a friend's house a few years back, maybe a week after she'd had a baby. I walked in the door and hung up my coat and she burst into tears and said \"thank god you're here\", handed me the baby and went to get in the shower. She hadn't been able to wash herself for a week because that simple basic human need had been overwhelmed by other things considered more urgent.

Mother's day isn't until Sunday.", "I've been in a similar situation, and let me just say, however het you are, you can be a threat to a marriage.\n\nMy best friend was married to a guy that, well, sucked. He weaponised incompetence to nuclear levels and made promises of changing/stepping up that never came to be. It got worse when they got married and had a baby, but by that time I'd gone to uni (at 27), and wasn't around as much.\n\nWhich, in hindsight, is probably one of the reasons he felt secure in being an even worse husband. Because before, I lived with them. I'd do things for my best friend - gifts, making her food/drinks, splitting 'their share' of the housework with her - and he almost never did. He looked terrible by comparison, but I refused to stop doting on my best friend (he did ask me to, more than once) so he'd look better by contrast. Eventually, he resorted to lying about who'd done certain bits of housework, taking credit for my actions, trying to claw back any semblance of seeming like a caring partner. It wasn't until I'd moved out that my best friend realised the extent of his lies, and how much she'd been making excuses for him. It took longer for her to leave him, and I was so proud of her for doing it when she had a newborn baby and a full-time job (he never kept a job longer than 3 months).\n\nAnyway, to summarise; by existing, and loving your friend the way she deserves to be loved, you're undermining him and threatening their marriage.

Youve got a keeper there.", "That's semantics, isn't it? If the husband weren't failing as a partner, sure, the friend's behaviour wouldn't be a threat to the marriage. The husband is at fault, but the friend is the catalyst, or mirror. Which one is the 'threat' is just a matter of perspective!", "Yeah, but that's not gender specific - in a healthy relationship, neither a man nor a woman should be a \"threat\" if your so is friends with them. \n\nNobody from outside can really threaten a marriage, tbh. If one partner decides to cheat then their decision to cheat is a threat to the marriage. If one partner is an asshole and a friend helps the other leave, the asshole is the threat to the marriage. The whole idea of \"homewreckers\" puts the responsibility off the person that's cheating onto the person they're cheating with, and that's not okay. If you know the person you're dating/having sex with is in a (monogamous) relationship you need to break up, but you're not the reason they're cheating (as flattering as it may seem, it isnt).", "That\u2019s how these things tend to work", "Why would anyone who loves you ever be upset that someone else who loves you gave you a gift on a day to celebrate your tough work? \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly self-serving of him to be causing an issue about his wife\u2019s friend doing an incredibly kind gesture when they know that she is having a tough time.\n\n If he was a little upset and kept it inside, that\u2019s one thing. But making a scene and causing issue is what makes him TA. He can\u2019t control how he feels initially, but he does control how he reacts to those feelings. He chose wrong.", "Why would a gift from your husband be less important because somebody else gave you another one? I don't celebrate it either but i get and give gifts around the year, plus the Christmas/birthday ones.\n\nSo again - why would he be upset?\n\nAny gift from my husband will have a higher value in my heart than a friend's. Kids'gifts win over husband's and so on.\n\nAnd OP wanted her friend to feel good and appreciated. That's why the husband is upset. Because he forgot and this gift reminded him.", "> Personally I don't see the point of mothers day\n\nYes, it's drippingly obvious from your post that you don't understand anything about it.", "I think the fact that you don\u2019t see the point of Mother\u2019s Day speaks volumes about you not getting the point of this comment. Mother\u2019s Day as well as Father\u2019s Day are two of the most important days in the world because without them none of us would be here. You can\u2019t say that about a lot of other days or holidays.", "the root of the problem is the husband, therefore he is the threat. The only perspective that he isn\u2019t is a bias one, which frankly doesn\u2019t matter in my opinion. \n\nAnyone on the outside looking in of a dynamic such as mentioned above can clearly see the husband is the only threat to the marriage. One or a couple people believing otherwise doesn\u2019t change what\u2019s obvious to everyone else. \n\nBoth points are semantics, that\u2019s how semantics works. Since we are both contemplating the meaning of the word \u201cthreat\u201d in this scenario, we are all discussing semantics.", "Nobody said it was gender specific, I\u2019m just talking about this situation. \n\nI\u2019m really not sure of your point because you clearly agree with me but seem to be coming across as if you don\u2019t. We agree", "This makes it sound like mothers and fathers would cease to exist without each getting a specific celebratory day for it.\n\nSomeone can love their parent(s) and still not like the day itself. It IS extremely commercialised.\n\nNot wishing to participate doesn't make someone a bad person.\n\nOP is clearly NTA, and the husband certainly doesn't come across well.\n\nHowever, I simply disagree that \"mothers and fathers day are two of the most important days in the world because without them none of us would be here.\"\n\nPeople have been having children long before these days were ever a thing.", "Then her present could have waited until after.", "Why does it matter?", "It matters to the husband, she should have mentioned it to him first and seen if he was ok with it and if he wasn't she should've respected that and waited.\n\nIf the husband wasn't around then I would see no problem with what op did, but he is around.", "He isn\u2019t the one being celebrated. He isn\u2019t a mother this isn\u2019t about him", "Why? \n\nIt would never occur to me to ask someone for permission to celebrate another adult."]}
