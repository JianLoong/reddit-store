She has a best friend, Sophie, (12). Both of the girls have special needs and are around 6 years old mentally. \n\nSophies mom called me yesterday, said that they were at an indoor playground, and Sophie wanted to know if Ellie could come and play. Sophies mom offered to put me on her punch card (she prepays for 10-20 visits at a time because it\u2019s cheaper) so it would be free for me so I got Ellie in the car and we met them at the playground. \n\nAfter about an hour of playing, the girls started to get hungry. I packed a snack for Ellie but Sophie\u2019s mom didn\u2019t have any snacks on her. I told her they sell snacks in the front but she claimed that she didn\u2019t have any money on her and asked me to buy Sophie some goldfish. I said sure, Venmo me and I\u2019ll grab some. \n\nI said no, I took care of my kid and it\u2019s not my job to take care of hers too. She says she paid for my kid to get in so I could cover the $2 for the goldfish. I told her if she wanted me to bring snacks she should\u2019ve told me when she invited me but I won\u2019t be wasting $2 for a $.50 bag of goldfish because she was unprepared. She went up to the front and I don\u2019t know if she lied about not having money but she came back with goldfish and fruit snacks. Now she\u2019s being petty by asking me to pay her back for all of the times we\u2019ve used their memberships and guest passes so we\u2019re not getting along. \n\nI\u2019m going to have to see her at school drop off/pickup, ballet class, gymnastics class, and the girls weekly play dates so I wanted to know if I was the asshole for not buying her kid a snack.", "created_utc": 1704652128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190yptj/aita_for_not_buying_snacks_for_my_daughters_best/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You also jeopardized your daughter's friendship with this girl. I really hope this is a fake story because it's hard to believe anyone can be this dense.", "YTA unless the $2 is a hardship or you didn\u2019t have it.", "YTA. What parent doesn\u2019t pack extra snacks for the friend? Also, she got you in free multiple times and you can\u2019t give her $2. Wow, I feel sorry for your daughter.", "YTA she paid for your kid at the playground. Weird how you know its cheaper to pay upfront", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nWithout a doubt. \n\nHow much did you save by not having to pay the entry fee for your daughter. Dollars to goldfish it was more than $2.", "YTA. Yeah keep that $2 at the cost of nuking your daughter's friendship.", "It's disappointing that you chose to act that way over $2 even after the generosity you've been given. With all the invites you got and access for free you couldn't have it in your heart to spend that little amout of money for your friend? That's cheaper than buying someone coffee and you say she's a friend?? I wouldn't want you as a friend. YTA", "YTA.  Sophie's mom is not the one being \"petty.\"", "YTA\u2026you were invited to a place for free that you would otherwise have had to pay for.  You only packed snacks for your child?  Why?  Why didn\u2019t you also take snacks for the other child?  Yes, you did not have to do so, and that child is not your responsibility, but if I was meeting someone for a playdate for my child, not paying to get in, knowing, at some point both girls were going to be hungry, I would have packed snacks for both, as a thank you for the invitation and just because.  I would call the other mom TA as well, because if she has passes to this place, she knows her child will want a snack, but from your other comments, this seems to be a recurring theme for you.  Your daughter is invited numerous times?  You accept the generosity, but do not reciprocate in any way?   At least not that you state.  So, due to a pack of goldfish, because of you, your daughter might not see so many invites to playdates any longer.  Exactly, who is mentally 6 years old in this snenario?  The children or the parents?,", "YTA. Wow, you're vile. Imagine ruining the experiences for two special needs girls over $2.", "Ykyta. You know. YTA", "YTA\n\nSo she regularly lets you use her memberships and stuff for things, but a $2 bag of goldfish is too much. Yes, she should have done X Y Z ahead of time but people forget things, it happens. You could have just done her the solid.\n\nDo you *ever* spend money on her kid? Ever let them use a service you already pay for? If not you're mega the AH.\n\nAll this over $2, what are you? 12?", "YTA,\n\nYou may have to meet her at school drop offs/pick ups and ballet and gymnastics classes.. \n\nHowever future playdates are most likely out the window.. so you may forget about them.. \n\nWhat a selfish, ignorant AH you are..", "YTA and you just ruined your kids chance of more play dates, especially free ones !", "YTA. A cheap one. The friend\u2019s mother paid the entrance, you pay snacks. It\u2019s not that hard.", "do you really need to ask? she gave you free admission for your daughter on multiple occasions and you can't even pay $2 for a snack? YTA", "YTA.  You got free admission and you didn't just offer to buy the snack as a thank you?  Wow, that's cold and ungrateful.", "YTA.  No doubt about it.", "She\u2019s being petty?  Do you even hear yourself? Your daughter got in to the event for free because of her generosity and you can\u2019t even spring for a $2 bag of goldfish? You passed her on the petty meter a long time ago, not that she was in any way being petty here. She was just asking for a kindness and you\u2019re so hung up on penny pinching you can\u2019t see how wrong you are. I\u2019m surprised you have any friends and by being so petty probably just cost your daughter this friend. Shame on you. YTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s $2 for god\u2019s sake and the child was hungry. I would have just paid for the damn goldfish.", "YTA. Why are you nickel and diming a person who isn\u2019t doing that to you? She lets you use her membership without asking for payment but you can\u2019t buy her a $2 snack? If money is tight then maybe you can make that clear but you went about it in such a rude way. It\u2019s not your job to take care of her child, but it\u2019s basic human decency to return a favor and feel a little gratitude for the free entry.", "She let you in for free, and you could give her kiddo som GOLDFISH.

Yeah, she\u2019s the parent so she\u2019s responsible for her own kid. But parents are humans and can unfortunately forget things sometimes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good to have friends to count on in those scenarios\u2026I sure wish she had one, cause you ain\u2019t it!\n\nShe\u2019s paid for you and your daughter to do things *for free* multiple times.

In case there is any confusion you are the freeloading & ungrateful non-friend other people on Reddit complain about. You have just discovered the consequences of your actions. Now pay up.", "YTA.\n\nI'm tight on money but still make sure we have extra snacks for friends when we go out. She paid for your entrance and you couldn't pay for some measly snacks!? And now risked a friendship over 50 cents ($2) !?! Not your smartest moment", "YTA. God you are awful.", "YTA\u2026 you stated yourself she\u2019s paid for multiple stuff for your daughter and you but you were so greedy for 2 dollars? Don\u2019t expect anything free from her anymore and I hope she doesn\u2019t continue her generosity towards you.", "YTA - just a bit of kindness wouldn\u2019t go amiss. Parenting is hard and as you know we forget stuff sometimes. You could\u2019ve helped her out as she provided entrance and fun for you and yours.", "YTA. This is the pettiest rubbish I've ever heard. \n\nWhen I'm out on playdates with other parents, it wouldn't even occur to me to withhold snacks from another child. Some playdates it's me handing them out, other times it's the other parent, swings and roundabout.\n\nIt was about $2, I mean, really?! Factor in the fact the other mother got your free entry, you really are ridiculous. If it was me, I certainly wouldn't meet up with you again.", "YTA, it\u2019s such a small amount of money why even make this an issue. People aren\u2019t perfect and they make mistakes. A friend, or even a nice person, can pick up a $2 freaking tab. And you should get your own damn membership going forward scrooge", "YTA.\n\nYou mention she has paid multiple times for your daughter\u2019s entrance fees. She clearly doesn\u2019t usually ask you for money or take advantage of the friendship.\n\nNow this strong friendship is in jeopardy because she\u2019s generous with you but you won\u2019t return the favor in a smaller one off ask. \n\nYou wanted a transactional friendship and are going to get exactly what you asked for. Don\u2019t expect free invitations in the future and make sure to budget accordingly - gym costs are way more than goldfish. \n\nWas saving $2.00 really worth it?", "YTA, congratulations you just may have ruined your daughter's friendship with your cheapness.", "Yta, The friend's mother basically paid for you and your daughter to get into the play area, and you couldn't afford $2 to buy her a snack and help pay her back for letting you in for free. You are so cheap. Silly. If I was the friend's mother I would never offer you a guest pass and you would have to pay your own way from now on. And it could be a chance that there are going to be no more play dates because her mother should be very upset with you and a lot of times that affects the friendships as a girls.\n\nSo you'll take her money to let you in for free. But you couldn't take $2 to buy a snack. You need to look at your entitlement. Just a smidge", "YTA - she paid for you to get in multiple times.  You're selfish and SOOO petty.", "Wow. She may have asked you to buy a snack to send a message, which you clearly did not receive. YTA", "YTA\n\nThis woman has saved you a significant amount of money. You can\u2019t buy one snack? And may be your friend but you aren\u2019t hers.", "YTA. If I pack snacks for my child on an outing, I would automatically pack extra for the friend.\n\nIn this case, since you were thoughtless enough not to pack enough for both girls, I would have happily paid for the overpriced snack since she saved me money on the entrance fee.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s called manners lady. You don\u2019t have any problem taking from her, then scuff at the possibility of you sharing a gf snack?\n\nWith friends like you, who needs enemies.", "YTA. She paid for your admission and you won't buy her daughter $2 worth of snacks because they are overpriced (in your opinion?). You owe her an apology", "YTA I have read some petty posts but you take the biscuit. You're enjoying the indoor playground on someone else's dime and you get on your high horse about $2 worth of snacks!?\n\n>I\u2019m going to have to see her at school drop off/pickup, ballet class, gymnastics class, and the girls weekly play dates so I wanted to know if I was the asshole for not buying her kid a snack.\n\nYes YTA. Don't worry tho, you and your daughter won't be receiving an invitations for play dates any time soon.", "YTA \u2014 How can you not know that?!", "YTA. The civil thing to do when someone pays for your entrance is to at least offer to pay for snacks. You just go up and say \"of course, you got us in, after all\".", "They have a sign at the desk saying a punchcard is $100 for 10 entries, so $10 an entry. Entry without a punchcard is $15.", "YTA. Big time.", "Right. I am not sure how OP thinks there will be future playdates after this.", "I would have paid for the goldfish even if the friend hadn't paid for my ticket! OP is terrible.", "You\u2019d probably better buy one of those then because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be getting in for free anymore.", "So she\u2019s spent $10, multiple times, for your daughter to enter and you can\u2019t spend $2 for her kid to have a snack?\n\nI don\u2019t understand how you could be possible asking here. \n\nObviously, YTA", "I meant weird you thought to include that info to further prove YTA", "So you are a cheap and ungrateful AH. Got it", "I think One flew over the Cuckoo's nest with this one in regards to still believing there'd be future playdates", "Exactly. She\u2019s probably thinks the other mom will still be paying the entry fee. I couldn\u2019t imagine ruining my child\u2019s friendship over $2.", "Yeah, the child's friendship is ruined and unfortunately both girls will be left in the wilderness of wondering.. they won't be able to comprehend.. \n\n All she had to do was bring a few snacks or buy a couple snacks.. that was all.. \n\nAnd now all gone because of OPs own AHolery"]}
