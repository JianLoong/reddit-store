You are so cheap. Silly. If I was the friend's mother I would never offer you a guest pass and you would have to pay your own way from now on. And it could be a chance that there are going to be no more play dates because her mother should be very upset with you and a lot of times that affects the friendships as a girls.\n\nSo you'll take her money to let you in for free.

Then, you didn't even think to pack extra snacks for her kid even though she graciously paid for your kid's entry into the playground.

It just feels like a needlessly stingy thing to put your foot down over. How do you know she wouldn't have given you the $2 back the next time you saw her?

So your daughter has an enriched life with a good friend to play with and from a family willing to pay for your daughter to enjoy what she otherwise couldn't.

All 3 boys have been best friends since they were 6. All 3 boys spend every weekend at my house. EVERY single week my mom sends my younger brother with some snacks. And she ALWAYS makes sure there are 3 of every snack. She recently took the boys to an amusement park for the youngest brothers birthday, the parents paid the ticket and she bought them lunch. It is important to mention my mother is far from high income. But she makes sure every kid that isn't hers and is with her kid, gets the same treatment her kid would get.

I agree that generally it\u2019s a good rule of thumb to have snacks on you when you have kids. I\u2019ve got snacks at all times for myself and I\u2019m a grown ass adult haha. \n\nI agree that it\u2019s weird the mom insisted on op paying for her own daughters snack, but it\u2019s weirder that op was unwilling to spend $2 for goldfish after getting in for free. Sure, it wasn\u2019t op\u2019s responsibility, but its $2 after not paying for entrance fees. Personally I would\u2019ve offered to cover the cost of a couple of snacks since they used a punch on me. I understand the argument that $2 is more than you would spend per bag if you bought the snacks at a store, but is $1.50 worth a fight with your child\u2019s best friend\u2019s mother?

That\u2019s fucked. YTA, OP. Generosity is never owed to you and should always be appreciated, no matter how much expendable income the person giving to you has. And then to ask for a Venmo over $2?
