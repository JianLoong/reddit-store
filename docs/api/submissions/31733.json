I have a four year old with my ex. We have 75/25 to now 50/50 to now me having full physical custody. She had twins with her fiance the beginning of this year but then they broke up. They\u2019re almost a year old now. Im remarried as well. Ever since she had the twins, my daughter has become second (or i guess third) to her mom. She comes to my house unbathed, dirty clothes, no bag with her. She claims shes stressed with twins (I get it) and \u201cbroke\u201d. I asked how is she broke when I pay her 1200 a month in child support?\n\n\nShe says one of her twins has medical issues and the other requires a certain formula and the money goes quickly with all their groceries. I told her thats not my concern and the money she gets is PLENTY to have our daughter three weeks out of the month. I told her to put her ex on child support and she says he left the country. I actually searched him up and he is traveling through Australia\u2026\n\nI asked my ex for an extra week then and she agreed. Our custody is a court order but I didn't feel the need to actually go to the court to modify it. A few months ago after an argument when she missed pick up because supposedly it was too stressful to put her kids in the car she threatened to get my payments increased since I got a new promotion. I knew she was saying it to get me mad and wasnt going to actually do it but I was pissed and went ahead to file for full physical custody and got it. My child support was lowered to 600$ which is ridiculous since she only gets her once a week now which is now just one weekend.\n\nIm asking if Im an asshole because the pay cut is affecting her twins life and shes now in debt with insurance and prescription price and shes claiming I stole our daughter from her because shes poor. A lot of people we mutually know are saying Im being a petty asshole. The money wasnt hurting me but it was the principle. Im starting to feel bad now though.

They seriously expect  you to support her kids with another man that's off galavanting around in Australia? So if she has more kids with more guys do they expect you to essentially support those kids too? Child support is supposed to support the child that the order is for . And considering you have your child most of the time now I don't think it's fair you still have to pay 600 for one week a month.

There was a lot of pettiness going on. Especially since she said she\u2019s suffering from mental health issues. No mother should be ripped from their child because they need additional assistance. There seems to be a lot of holes in this story. If she was suffering mentally, why not try to help her instead of taking her child away from her? Her other ex was an a hole for leaving, and no you\u2019re not responsible for those children. However, please remember the moves you\u2019re making now, being vindictive will eventually have an effect on your child as well.

Go after the horrible father of her twins,  he is making your life harder and you don't even know it.  Lazy, neglectful Dad's, make your real arguments really easy to dismiss as an excuse.  If he is paying, and that is where her anger sticks, then that is a win. Maybe she won't be so quick to anger, towards you and won't financially attack you, the person who can pay.  Also, your daughter maybe watching.  Not now, but 20 years from now. No, it is not your job. Or responsibility. So you don't have to do Any of these things, and don't have any guilt.

But do you understand how difficult it is to prove abuse in family courts?  About 10 times harder than it is to disprove it. I am operating under the assumption this is a good Dad, and he would never willingly allow his daughter to be abused. He did the right thing here, and made sure his daughter was living in the best environment.  It is rare for any state children services even if they are financially able to recommend the removal of children for what he has shared. But only people with wealthy pockets, corporate backed professionals like physicians are able to remove a child quick, and for an undisclosed amount of time.  \nIt's the saddest reality I have ever seen, personally. Courts need to see blood, broken bones, or history of these things on record, and drugs, and needles, sometimes need to catch an addict in the act and high, with no food, no utilities, trash every where, and even save a 2 year old from walking into traffic, because of the states \"standards, or requirements\". And if it is the first time they get involved , leniancy from court punishment will make you physically sick.  \nJust know every kid that has been removed, has already been a victim in the worst ways first.    \nAnd that's a GOVERNMENT employee.  If a Parent walks in, sincere, cries during their statement, with pictures of kid, trash, marks, bruises.  The courts, who are so afraid to make the wrong decision, will do nothing instead. This parent needs to do this, many times.  Which means this child needs to be hurt unnecessary. \nIt is all about that family.   Even if the family has a wonderful father, with funds. And a mother who has track marks, a criminal record  with child abuse charges.  Mom will never be removed from the picture. \n\nI hate everything about it. \n\nOnly way to be successful, is keep his daughter physically safe, and unfortunately get comfortable with doing something different.", "I don\u2019t think it has to do with whether a person is a man or woman. It\u2019s about being a decent human. If you\u2019re willing to make a child with someone, you should be able to help them in some ways.

If you were any older than say my favorite bra, you would have this same life wisdom.  They have a daughter together.  He will spend the same amount of energy, time and money in the courts, while making this co parent an enemy.  \nMaybe he tries a different approach. And maybe it makes a difference?  Maybe he discovers he can not do anything right in this mothers eyes. \n\nEither way, he is not a dumb person. He will document his attempts, and IDK use that documentation in his next court appearance. And maybe he will be done, with ever needing to do anything more.

There's zero possibility anything beyond sending her with a backpack of clean clothes should be necessary... as mom's in very tight finances, sending packed meals or a couple hundred dollars to be nice and pay for the meals for mom and daughter (since twins aren't eating adult food it doesn't apply in any case) while she visit - like one would do if visiting a friend or grandparents for a weekend maybe - would fit.  \n\n\nBut $600/mth for 2 days is not a balancing of costs and lifestyle by any stretch.", "I still think it\u2019s ridiculous. $600 and she has her one weekend a month.", "Yes. She was already sending OP's daughter home unwashed with dirty clothes and stealing the child support when it was double what he pays now. Two days a month and she somehow still needs $600? Yeah, no. That is theft. She can get her shot together first. Until then, OP can keep his money, ensuring it's doing what it's supposed to, and his daughter can have everything she needs instead of being neglected by a witch who decided her new kids are more interesting.", "I guess", "It's Australia. They definitely can enforce child support in Australia.", "That money is solely to help with the rent so the child has a home to go to & a little bit of groceries so the child is fed while there & while I totally understand & agree she would have to pay for rent & food herself even if that kid wasn't there/didn't exist- the child does exist & has to be provided for & it sounds like the mother is living in poverty so it does make sense she would need help with shelter & the courts would rather get it from it the other parents than pay it out in state benefits. Either way, this guy sounds like a great dad for taking action & full responsibility when his kiddo needed him.", "He said once a week, so I would imagine every weekend.", "I completely agree. My partner pays $400 in CS, pays for her health insurance, and has his daughter most of the time even though their custody order is supposed to be him having her EOWE.
