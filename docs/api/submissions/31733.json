I have a four year old with my ex. We have 75/25 to now 50/50 to now me having full physical custody. She had twins with her fiance the beginning of this year but then they broke up. They\u2019re almost a year old now. Im remarried as well. Ever since she had the twins, my daughter has become second (or i guess third) to her mom. She comes to my house unbathed, dirty clothes, no bag with her. She claims shes stressed with twins (I get it) and \u201cbroke\u201d. I asked how is she broke when I pay her 1200 a month in child support?\n\n\nShe says one of her twins has medical issues and the other requires a certain formula and the money goes quickly with all their groceries. I told her thats not my concern and the money she gets is PLENTY to have our daughter three weeks out of the month. I told her to put her ex on child support and she says he left the country. I actually searched him up and he is traveling through Australia\u2026\n\nI asked my ex for an extra week then and she agreed. Our custody is a court order but I didn't feel the need to actually go to the court to modify it. A few months ago after an argument when she missed pick up because supposedly it was too stressful to put her kids in the car she threatened to get my payments increased since I got a new promotion. I knew she was saying it to get me mad and wasnt going to actually do it but I was pissed and went ahead to file for full physical custody and got it. My child support was lowered to 600$ which is ridiculous since she only gets her once a week now which is now just one weekend.\n\nIm asking if Im an asshole because the pay cut is affecting her twins life and shes now in debt with insurance and prescription price and shes claiming I stole our daughter from her because shes poor. A lot of people we mutually know are saying Im being a petty asshole. The money wasnt hurting me but it was the principle. Im starting to feel bad now though.

And depending on the specific country and the level of court that the case ends up appearing in, not just a lawyer, such as in the US but multiple lawyers, for example, in the UK, one might need both a solicitor and a barrister, again if it appears in a high enough court, which is more likely in such complex cases, than in ordinary family court cases.\n\nIn the past, 10+ yrs ago, I have had friends who have had international  child support cases that have utilised the Hague convention, between the UK and European countries or NA, and they were in contact with their exes, to maintain the kids' relationship via phone or video, so home locations etc were all known but their costs were still very high, in the 10s of thousands of \u00a3/\u20ac/$ on both sides.\n\nIt was also emotionally and mentally demanding for them to deal with the complex legal wrangling and arguments, on top the added difficulties of having to organising international travel for visitation, often with very argumentative,  obstructive and unreasonable exes who refused to work around school holidays or understand why young children need to fly with an accompanying adult!.\n\nOf course, the other very real arsehole in this post, as in very many other posts in this sub, if there is any grain of truth in the post, is a country that does not have universal healthcare and forces a single mother to choose between paying for her twins medical needs or clothing and feeding her children.\n\nIt's also a country that does not have a robust social welfare system that will ensure that all parents can feed and clothe their children!\n\nAnd I'm not just targeting the US here. The UK is just as at fault and has been for many years. When I left the UK in 2005, food banks were very rare, something utilised by those in the most extreme, desperate situations, and having to go to one was something that we thought happened in America! \n\nBut for the last 10 years, at least, thanks to the Tories, they are now just part of everyday life, used by working people, by  disabled people, by working couples with families, or without, by nurses, by teachers even.\n\nThere's also the problematic idea, often brought up by fathers who pay child support, that it exists as this idealistically ring-fenced pot of money somewhere, only to be spent on indulgences for their child or children. Some even think that they can expect to receive a monthly bundle of receipts to see how it was spent! It just doesn't work like that!\n\nOnce child support hits the other parent's bank account, it becomes theirs to spend. It's fungible and has to go towards,  in part, a plethora of financial expenditures, some are annual, some are monthly, weekly, daily, others may be occasional, regular or spontaneous, but still very necessary.\n\nEverything from what it costs to pay for housing, including rent/mortgage, any local taxes or similar; electric, water, gas, and any other heating costs. TV licences or cable or streaming subscriptions plus phone and internet too. Medical insurance, not just in the US, even here in France, we have to pay a small amount (in comparison) each month, for top-up cover.\n\nTransport costs including maintenance and taxes to keep a car on the road, paying for school transport and transport to appointments and activities; paying for furniture and household goods to be replaced over the long term - perhaps a washing machine or a new mattress for the kid's bed that might need to be replaced.\n\nThen there's everything you need in a home to maintain it and you, to keep it clean and comfortable, cleaning products and so on.\n\nThat's before we get to paying for things that go directly to the kids themselves, like food and clothes and toys and school stuff. And paying for their phones and electronics and  their activities, and the things you need to pick up for them when you least expect it, like the over the counter cream from the pharmacy for a rash or some new pairs of trousers because they just had a sudden growth spurt.\n\nIf this post were real, I couldn't find either the OP or his ex at fault honestly.

If you don\u2019t want to explain that is fine you don\u2019t have to, I just wasn\u2019t and am not able to see why/how this is relevant to the situation OP posted. That is all.", "Family annihilator is not relevant in this specific situation though. If it is, how do? Are you speaking of the ex, the exes baby daddy orOP? And if yes to any what if any leads that to be a possibility with two of those people being in one country and one absconding to Australia. I am just plain confused. That\u2019s why I am asking. I still don\u2019t see where the connection is between those things and what that has to do with a family annihilator.", "Australia still have a reciprocal agreement with the US - a US court order for child support will be carried out by the Australian government.\n\nHe can't escape his duties by being here.", "I have lived this for 14 yrs and my Grandma lived it for years with 9 kids one of which was special needs and medically sick. She never allowed her kids to be unbathed or u tidy and kept a tidy home, and they were dirt poor.

It's the only reason this sub exists.\n\nI think we all know how he'd respond when a little bit of fault lands in his own lap.", "Demanding more money by threatening to get child support payments raised so she can provide for children that are not his was a bad choice. Then getting upset when he applied for full custody of the child that *is* his.\n\nIt\u2019s a bad choice to use people. That\u2019s got nothing to do with gender.\n\nShe should have chosen differently. She\u2019s the one that can\u2019t afford to care for her kids. If she needs help *she* needs to get it. Trying to force him was a stupid decision on her part.", "Because people have partners, spouses, boyfriends/girlfriends, husbands/wife, etc.  We have alot of words you can use for that, honestly more than necessary.\n\nAnimals have Mates.\n\nNow while *technically* all of those words would be getting the same gist across, \"Mate\" sounds impersonal, and like its mostly about sex. So when you have so many words to chose from, and you use the only one that we also use for animals, people get a weird vibe off it"]}
