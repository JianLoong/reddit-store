I have a four year old with my ex. We have 75/25 to now 50/50 to now me having full physical custody. She had twins with her fiance the beginning of this year but then they broke up. They\u2019re almost a year old now. Im remarried as well. Ever since she had the twins, my daughter has become second (or i guess third) to her mom. She comes to my house unbathed, dirty clothes, no bag with her. She claims shes stressed with twins (I get it) and \u201cbroke\u201d. I asked how is she broke when I pay her 1200 a month in child support?\n\n\nShe says one of her twins has medical issues and the other requires a certain formula and the money goes quickly with all their groceries. I told her thats not my concern and the money she gets is PLENTY to have our daughter three weeks out of the month. I told her to put her ex on child support and she says he left the country. I actually searched him up and he is traveling through Australia\u2026\n\nI asked my ex for an extra week then and she agreed. Our custody is a court order but I didn't feel the need to actually go to the court to modify it. A few months ago after an argument when she missed pick up because supposedly it was too stressful to put her kids in the car she threatened to get my payments increased since I got a new promotion. I knew she was saying it to get me mad and wasnt going to actually do it but I was pissed and went ahead to file for full physical custody and got it. My child support was lowered to 600$ which is ridiculous since she only gets her once a week now which is now just one weekend.\n\nIm asking if Im an asshole because the pay cut is affecting her twins life and shes now in debt with insurance and prescription price and shes claiming I stole our daughter from her because shes poor. A lot of people we mutually know are saying Im being a petty asshole. The money wasnt hurting me but it was the principle. Im starting to feel bad now though.

If he earns money the govt can garnish his wages.", "You can since both the US and Australia are Hague Convention signatories.", "Maybe he will one day want to go back. Or one day he will be in enforceable country. Why risk losing money. She should apply for child support and have it recorded in the system.\nIn some countries you can even end up in jail if you travel back there and have a lot of child support unpaid.", "If he does not, she will not be worse for it. But if she applies for child support and he is eventually back, it could be very much worth it.", "Not necessarily. If the two countries have reciprocity they\u2019ll cooperate to get the money out of him.", "If he's working under the table or has rich relatives that support him or pay his expenses in a roundabout manner (he works for them pro bono officially but no legal paycheck), then getting child support from him will be near impossible.", "That you use the words destitute mother means you\u2019re not thinking about the child, you\u2019re thinking about the mother. \n\nChild\u2019s needs should be fully supported by both parents, and since child is with father 25/30 days every month, mother should pay to the father to provide her portion of childcare expenses. That is fair. \n\nCourts have long agreed when a man has more children it does not lower his child support payments. So when a woman has more children, it should absolutely not mean she gets a pass on supporting the first child she already had an obligation towards.", "The courts, who I presume are more familiar with child support law than you, disagree.", "It sounds like one of her youngest children is medically complex. I doubt it\u2019s that her younger children are \u201cmore interesting.\u201d I would imagine that they are more stressful. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve ever had a child or been through the court system with children, but in general it\u2019s seen as in the child\u2019s best interest to maintain the status quo. I\u2019m also not sure where you live, but $600 would not even cover half of the rent in most places in the US. Even $1200 barely covers a one bedroom in many parts of the same. The status quo is to make sure the mom isn\u2019t homeless and has the ability to feed the child when the child visits. That\u2019s what the $600 is being used for. Dad likely makes bank, and the court seems to think he can afford it. Even he has said the $1200 per month wasn\u2019t affecting him, he just didn\u2019t want to pay it.", "I cannot answer your questions in a way that will bring you any satisfaction. All I can say is that the best interest of the child principle is a substantive right that obliges states to make the best interest of the child a primary consideration in any decisions that affect a child. That people on here seem so fully against this makes me sad for all the children that are of risk of not being heard.", "With minimum wage what it is, who says she doesn\u2019t already have one? Most of the time the courts won\u2019t divvy up child support like this unless and until both parents are employed.", "The child only has one mother. It's wrong to say that the child shouldn't have a living relationship with her due to financial difficulties. One of the goals of child support is to help the child have a consistent standard of living across both homes.", "He did do something  before he didn't just act because of the money, he took his child unofficially for 50/50 without going to court from 70/30 before in favor of the mother keeping the child support where it was despite the increase in physical custody . \n\nAnd when the mother was unreliable and threatened him on top of it ( instead of apologizing and promise to try at least to do better) and he took her to court for change of custody.", "> She made her bed\n\nBy \"making her bed\", you mean giving birth to a sick child?", "\"in the country\" is key here. If he steps foot in the US and gets arrested, even if there are 100k to his name, if all that is in some other country, it'll be like getting water from a stone for the authorities. Sooner or later, he'll serve out a paltry jail term and probably be released, at which point he could leave again or something.", "It's not nonsense. If he doesn't earn a paycheck in that country, then there's nothing to garnish. The point I was replying to was him getting arrested if he returns ti the country, by which point, he presumably has no garnishable assets there.", "Which is true, but if the assets aren't physically in the arresting country, little can be done.", "Yeah, she should probably do that, but it will not solve her current problems.", "> That you use the words destitute mother means you\u2019re not thinking about the child, you\u2019re thinking about the mother.\n\nThe mother is in fact a very important figure in the child's life? If the mother is destitute that means the child is also destitute during her custody time. That's all the person is saying, not that the mother's needs matter more or whatever.", "You\u2019re reading way too much into one single word my man. My interest lays solely in the best interest of the child according to the best interest of the child principle.", "That\u2019s assuming she has any money to give. The way I read this, he can give $1200 a month and it\u2019s like pocket change to him. The child doesn\u2019t need the father to have more money, but the days that the child is with the mother, the child needs the money. Does that make more sense?", "> I totally understand & agree she would have to pay for rent & food herself even if that kid wasn't there/didn't exist- the child does exist & has to be provided for & it sounds like the mother is living in poverty so it does make sense she would need help with shelter\n\nThe decision for who gets child support/who pays is only based on income when there is split custody. If op is the custodial parent, he would be the one receiving child support. Maybe he doesn't live in the US", "He's not only a great dad, he's a looser sucking up to the fraud courts, he should have left the country long ago for safe heavens.", "Though situations Like that typically stem from a combination of sexist judges and a somewhat recent change in their relative incomes, that the arrangement has not yet been adjusted for.", "He should go back to court to modify the physical placement time and he'd probably get the child support then. Child support is going to be based off the placement schedule in part so if it looks on paper like mom has her 75% of the time she'll keep getting child support.", "You obviously have challenges in reading comprehension. She was using the child support meant for their daughter to supplement costs for the twins. That is unacceptable.\n\nShe only gets 2 days a month. That is not enough time to justify OP being forced to give her money to avoid being homeless. He is not paying alimony. If she has money problems, that's her burden, not his, and their daughter is better off being with him 100% of the time.", "Wouldn't it simply be easier to remove the child from the mother's care until she was able to get back on her feet again?\n\n\nThat removes her financial responsibility as well as gives her breathing room. We accomplish all the same things without having to arbitrarily take money from somebody.", "Though the child's own opinion is a major factor. If the child herself does not wish to spend time with the mother or live with her, then her best interests are not being met, which perverts the point of child support in the first place.", "So what? No one can know now what will be in 10-15 years. Why should she give up on kids rights for support?", "If he has assets in the US, they can seize those.  If he has assets on Australia, Australia can seize them.", "Or the mother should do what men are expected to do GET A JOB! It\u2019s not op\u2019s fault she has other kids .", "How about she go find her twin\u2019s bio father instead of using op\u2019s money to support two kids he had literally zero choice in and was not related at all to? \n\nGo find his parents if she can\u2019t find him. Or sue him, and garnish his wages. Do anything other than skip out on her own responsibilities to her eldest child", "No that child needs a mother who will provide for her. It\u2019s not the responsibility of her father to do it for her mother, they\u2019re both responsible.", "In my state, they don\u2019t charge the custody schedule unless the child is in danger or both parties agree. His ex would never agree to change custody because then it would affect her money, lol", "No, I do not have any challenges in reading comprehension, sorry. HE claims that she was using the money meant for their daughter to supplement costs for the twins. HE does not provide evidence that all that money was going to the twins. He is an unreliable narrator. The court obviously thinks differently than he does, since they still want him to pay her. \n\n\u201cMoney problems\u201d cannot be used to keep a child away from their parent. It is in the best interest of a child to have a relationship with their parent, regardless of the financial status of that parent. It is in the best interest of the child to have the status quo maintained regardless of the length of the visits or the amount of custody. Child support and child custody are two separate courts for this reason. \u201cHe should have the child 100% because he makes more than her\u201d is a ridiculous line of thinking that would harm most children.", "You\u2019re still looking at it from a parental perspective. Yes, it would be simpler for the father sure, but would it be in the best interest of the child to be removed from their mothers care? How would it affect the child to not be able to see their mother? Those are the kind of questions that should be of primary consideration.", "Which depends on Australia cooperating. Of course, if he's travelling around there, he probably knows how to dodge that. I see people avoid it by working under the table or doing free work for rich relatives or friends in exchange for those people supporting them financially.", "Wait, wtf did Quebec do that they don't count?", "Not necessarily. Having a treaty doesn't necessarily mean the other country will follow it as seriously as you may want them to do so.", "So you want the child to be destitute during the time they are with their mother?", "Where does OP say she doesn't have a job? I missed it.", "Again, the mother is a very important figure in a child's life, and if she is destitute, the child is destitute, as well. There are a lot of things the mother should do, and no one in this conversation has condoned her actions, but it's in OP's best interest to make sure that the person taking care of his child has food and hot water and a place for his child to sleep.", "He should have her 100% of the time because her mother is neglecting her. He should not be paying child support because she only has her one weekend a month, and child support is not alimony. It is not his responsibility to fund his ex and her twins. $600 is way too much when she only gets 2 days a month.\n\nSeriously, the fact that she went from having 75% custody to only that amount says that even the judge thinks that home is not good for OP's daughter. Stop defending the ex. You look like a clown.", "French \ud83e\udd22", "Quebec has separate arrangements with other countries.", "Quebec really really wants to be their own country so they probably negotiated their own stuff.", "So do nothing, and don't even try, right?  There's no point in anyone trying to hold this person accountable for his children.", "I personally think when she was neglecting the child she should only have supervised visits with the child. Never alone with her.\n\nThe mother neglecting the child will never get better. As long as one of the twins are sick the daughters needs will be neglected. As the twins get older they will need more care which will result in the older child being neglected.", "Ok I\u2019ll give you she may have a job but if this was a dad then he be forced to figure it out.", "Fathers are equally as important but I\u2019m pretty sure the comment section would feel a little differently if it was a woman, working a full time job, caring for a child 25 days a month, and having to pay her male ex $600 for child support to \u201cfoster a good environment for the child because the father is destitute\u201d", "Isn\u2019t the point that the mother has stopped taking care of the child?"]}
