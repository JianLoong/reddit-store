I would like to start by saying that I was very excited to have a baby and am truly looking forward to being a father. My wife did not have any health complications or a particularly difficult birth, except for an ultra long labour (27 hours total).\n\nShe slept through a lot of it in the beginning but as it got progressively worse, she started to get more uncomfortable. Since we had been in the room for a very long time, I had started to get antsy. We both played on the nintendo in the beginning but she didn't want to anymore as the labour progressed.\n\nAbout 23 hours in, I started to play online chess on my phone as I held her hand through her contractions. She was fine with it at first, but then she snapped at me and told me to put my phone away. So I did. Then she told me off for bouncing my leg and then for drumming my fingers on the bed.\n\nI told her to stop yelling at me and to tell me exactly what she wanted me to do, which was apparently the wrong thing to say because she told me to leave and send her father in instead. This really pissed me off and I told her that I was not going to miss the birth of my child. She said she'd call me back when it was time but I really needed to leave as I was getting on her last nerve.\n\nI went out, where her parents were waiting and told her dad to go in. I was pretty upset, because I wanted to be there, to take care of her. Her mother tried to make me feel better, saying that it was a vulnerable time, and different women needed different things.\n\nWe were called in when she was finally giving birth, I caught the baby while her parents comforted her, just like we had planned. Everything seemed okay again, till her parents left and she asked if I was going to apologise. I told her that I didn't think I needed to and that if anyone owed me an apology, it was her.\n\nShe has been annoyed ever since and is not properly talking to me.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA? Should I simply apologise?\n\nedit: I wasn't bored.

I would recommend \"The Birth Partner\" if you are ever going that way again. Also for a first time mom from start to finish 27 hours is not that long. I assume you mean labour total and not active labour as you say you were playing nintendo together early on for a distraction.

You should have stopped the phone and stopped fidgeting like a toddler when she needed your support. If you had done that, she never would have sent you away to begin with.

Your wife was going through something stressful, exhausting, and painful that she can't opt out of or ignore. When she stopped playing videogames because she was unable to focus on anything other than labor, that was your cue to then focus *all* of your attention on her. \n\nYou say you have adhd and were anxious, which sucks, but think about how she feels.

I myself struggle with displaying appropriate levels of empathy, but this is an easy one. You even asking this question shows how little you understand, which is odd. You should care for this person.

If you wanted to be there you should have been more present and not a little wimp the minute someone going through a traumatic experience shows a little emotion towards you.

Giving birth is not a damn spectator sport, and absolutely no one has the \"right\" to be in that room, especially if they're not being helpful to the person shoving out a baby.

Being completely present and engaged and supportive for 27 hours is sort of unreasonable. I was in labor for about 40 hours but I had no choice in the matter and was required to be involved. My husband wasn\u2019t physically in any distress and I did not expect him to run on adrenaline to just \u2026 sit there\u2026 for two days. That\u2019s not possible. How can you expect someone\u2019s undivided attention for 27 hours and not expect their mind to wander? Holding someone\u2019s hand doesn\u2019t exactly keep your mind occupied. \n\nYeah, when she asked you to put it away, you should have, and you have to acknowledge that she was completely vulnerable and probably at the limits of her *everything* so she did not have the capacity for tact or diplomacy. Expecting her compassion for your feelings during a time that was definitely about her, that\u2019s also unreasonable. \n\nYou weren\u2019t able to be a total NPC during her labor, understandable. She wasn\u2019t able to overlook your nervous tics or try to sooth your nerves, also understandable. I don\u2019t think she needs to apologize for her response but you should apologize for trying to make her feel bad about it. It was a moment that you both should have left behind once the baby was born and chalked it up to everyone being past their limits. \n\nTo fix this now, focus on making a plan for the future. For example, you can promise that you\u2019ll give your undivided attention when she expresses the need and she\u2019ll promise to be upfront with you about when she needs it, and you\u2019ll both have to try to not be resentful when the communication fails.

I would like to start by saying that I was very excited to have a baby and am truly looking forward to being a father. My wife did not have any health complications or a particularly difficult birth, except for an ultra long labour (27 hours total). \n\nShe slept through a lot of it in the beginning but as it got progressively worse, she started to get more uncomfortable. Since we had been in the room for a very long time, I had started to get antsy. We both played on the nintendo in the beginning but she didn't want to anymore as the labour progressed. \n\nAbout 23 hours in, I started to play online chess on my phone as I held her hand through her contractions. She was fine with it at first, but then she snapped at me and told me to put my phone away. So I did. Then she told me off for bouncing my leg and then for drumming my fingers on the bed. \n\nI told her to stop yelling at me and to tell me exactly what she wanted me to do, which was apparently the wrong thing to say because she told me to leave and send her father in instead. This really pissed me off and I told her that I was not going to miss the birth of my child. She said she'd call me back when it was time but I really needed to leave as I was getting on her last nerve. \n\nI went out, where her parents were waiting and told her dad to go in. I was pretty upset, because I wanted to be there, to take care of her. Her mother tried to make me feel better, saying that it was a vulnerable time, and different women needed different things.\n\nWe were called in when she was finally giving birth, I caught the baby while her parents comforted her, just like we had planned. Everything seemed okay again, till her parents left and she asked if I was going to apologise. I told her that I didn't think I needed to and that if anyone owed me an apology, it was her. \n\nShe has been annoyed ever since and is not properly talking to me.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA? Should I simply apologise?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your baby is a basketball, your wife is a hoop, how can anyone expect you to abandon your phone for the birth of your child that might literally kill its mother as you drum you fingers impatiently on her bedspread, waiting for the broodmares to just get ON with it, already. I mean how hard can it be, you just lay there with a womb-burster as it winds its watermelon-sized self through your wife's reproductive system, tearing her vagina open, maybe all the way to her anus, and she might never orgasm again in her life for this gift she risked her life to give you, but damn, thirty hours is a looooooong time and you want your little pleasure NOW!

I\u2019m sure after almost a whole day you were getting anxious, but guess what? She\u2019s exhausted by that point, her body has been running a painful marathon that whole time.

You then put the phone away and started doing antsy behaviors, which in her mind probably felt like \u201cgeez I wish she would hurry up!!\u201d You were no longer being supportive in that moment so she asked for what she needed, a person who was fresh and still ready to give her support. I definitely snapped a bit at my husband even though he was being super supportive and helpful because guess what, it\u2019s hard to be at your best after hours worth of the worst pain ever. \n\nSo the only one owing an apology is you owing her.

My husband had to apologize to me because I still looked pregnant and didn't have ankles 3 days after giving birth which was obviously his fault since he got me pregnant.

I never begrudged my support person being on the phone, or stepping out for a bit, or talking to other people. \n\nIn my opinion, your wife had unrealistic expectations of you and no one could have lived up to them. The fact that she is still holding a grudge and refusing to communicate a week later just smacks of immaturity. If she\u2019s this upset that you got a bit fidgety 20 some odd hours in, she\u2019s got no hope of being able to deal with a toddler much less a teenager.", "NTA - but you have to apologize to her. It's not the hill to die on.", "When I went to visit my friend after she had a baby I asked her how she was doing and her husband answers \u201cgiving birth is rough\u2026I was so tired\u201d. Yeah I\u2019m sure it was rough on you lol", "I had a very long labour. When I was breathing through some contractions and the doctor and the midwife started chatting about some holiday plans they each had, I was so pissed off about it that I moaned as loudly as I could to drown them out, and, more than ten years later, it\u2019s one of the most salient memories I have of that experience. \n\n\nOP, please, please, get into deep listening mode, have some humility to recognize where you have made a mistake, apologise from your heart to your wife, and enjoy your new baby. Right now YTA.", "He's not just the AH he's a fucking seflish dumbass, child birth with no complications is still child birth for God sake.", "He meant Difficult, as in health complications\u2026", "Yes! \u201cCatch\u201d the baby, WTF??", "Not arguing with you, but you realize \u201cstop fidgeting like a toddler\u201d isn\u2019t possible, right?\n\nADHD is a legit medical disorder\u2026", "That's a divorce right there if that were me.", "Yeah, everyone\u2019s giving him a hard time, but I don\u2019t think he did anything criminally wrong. \n\nBut he should still apologize. Because she\u2019s his wife and gave birth to his child.", "My wife tried to wake me up to go to the hospital. I was out. So she got ready and packed her bag and then tried again. They had put her on bed rest to stave off delivery for a bit so she was ready to get it done. I jumped up and hurriedly got her out of the door not knowing it was the second time she tried. Everything else went mostly great. \n\nIn my defense I had only been home a few hours after flying out of Iraq into Kuwait, then to Atlanta, then had to rent a car and drive to Florida because cancelled flights. Took me 2-3 days to get home\u2026which is why they had her on bed rest.", "I cackled. It was bad at the time I'm sure, but this is so funny", "How common is that kind of dad?", "Agree! Give the woman a push present!!!", "And to discuss with a woman in labor? He should be lucky that she didn't curse and kick him out! And that she even let him in again. He should apologize big time for his very selfish behaviour! Asking a woman who just went through 27 hours of labor to apologize to her husband for being mean. I can't figure out if I should laugh or cry \ud83e\udd2f", "I think he handled this situation completely incorrectly, but the fidgeting is a symptom of ADHD.", "Yeah. If my stimming(like his) is bothering someone, I do my best to suppress it, if I can\u2019t, I remove myself from the situation (like his wife asked him to do). It\u2019s common courtesy.", "I have ADHD too and I'm NTA. He's horrible.", "This has been my dads nickname for me since I was little, I\u2019ve never seen or heard another person use it! I\u2019m very fond of it", "So when I was having my last child, my husband went and got himself Burger King from across the street, he brought it into the room and I could smell it, and it made me feel so sick that I made him go eat it in the bathroom.", "Girl, you know it's not fake lol", "Hmm. Ashley Madison disagrees.", "Nah if he has ADHD the fidgeting is part of the package, same with the boredom and inability to focus. You could be bouncing for 20 minutes and not realize it till someone points it out. The more sleep deprived you are the worst it gets too. OP is definitely TA but not for the fidgeting.", "In the US: nope. Every part of labor and delivery is for the medical team\u2019s convenience, not the mother\u2019s comfort.", "Some people get sick during labor so they don\u2019t recommend it.  Also if you might need a c section your not supposed to eat.  I could have had jello (don\u2019t like soup) but just the thought of jello made me cranky.  I wanted some cheesy and salty not jello lol.", "No, in case of emergencies and you need to be sedated. My mother was in labor for over 36 hours. They allowed her cup of orange juice, which she promptly barfed up. I was also born in October, so my dad watched 2 football games while in the room with my mother. She didn't get an epidural because she wanted a natural birth, then it became too late to administer one. She never mentions the football games, but every year since I was old enough to understand child birth, she has reminded me of how long she spent in labor on my birthday.", "Tacos are my love language", "But if you want to try this, make sure it is *her* love language. Otherwise she just might throw it in your face or use it to pay her attorney.", "I had my stomach cut open for my child and my cervix sewn shut so she wouldn't vacate early. Ovarian torsion after IVF. Awful bouts of bleeding throughout my pregnancy.\n\n Still didn't tell my husband he owed me sparkly trinkets for the best thing I ever did.", "He did NOT. Sweet baby Jesus. What is wrong with some men?!", "Crap on a cracker! Wtf???\n\nGood job getting that gone!", "My BFF's hubby got his wife her sushi after each of her four were born. All she wanted was her sushi she couldn't have for months! He was lucky enough not to be deployed and there for all of them. I am so glad you ditched #1 and found a good one for #2. I prefer auntihood, parenthood is not for the faint of heart. Cute little chaos gremlins but boy can kids be chaos gremlins! LOL", "This is what doctors who would like to bill a c-section want you to believe.  It's not evidence based, and doctors with low c-section rates won't restrict food until 7 cm along. I'm also fairly certain it's against ACOG guidelines.  It's actually proven that restricting food during labor leads to a higher probability of unnecessary interventions. \n\nIt sounds counterintuitive but obstetric abuse is fairly normalized in the US according to multiple organizations and studies. Too many doctors want control of their patient, (why do you think there will be a lot of unplanned c-sections next Saturday and Sunday?) and too many doctors like the paycheck they'll get from billing for interventions.", "Yep. My mother had to be stitched up after giving birth. It was really fast. 44 minutes and I was there.\n\nThe my had to pump everything out before she could be put to narcose.\n\nWas not funny...", "Hehe! I didn\u2019t eat my favourites (runny egg, soft cheeses, soft serve icecream) during my pregnancy and I think my husband was confused when I showed more emotion to him bringing me those than the beautiful jewellery he got me \ud83d\ude06", "Especially because scrabble takes up both hands (visospatial sketchpad) and brain (phonological loop), which combined are everything. If he's dying of boredom like he's implying, he could put one headphone in and be a present, still partner. Instead he was completely distracted and of zero help, while also being really annoying.", "Oh he did. I\u2019d already been lining things up to leave, this just solidified it.", "\ud83e\udee0 I got nothing but water ice and ice chips for my 25 hours of labor. It was really the icing on the cake of the unbearable pain. Then they wouldn't let me have solids for another 24 hours after my C-section -- just more stupid water ice and broth. Every time I got to order a \"meal\" I would order like 6 water ices ... hate the stuff now.", "Thanks for sharing. I didn't know about the risk for my first birth and ate fried chicken before going to the hosptal, on my aunt's suggestion.  Now that I know, and with stories like this, I think I would much rather eat jello and soup for a day than to worry about being put into a situation like that. I ended up not eating anyway for my other three because I had an accident after the first and it was super embarrassing for me.", "Food is a love language all it\u2019s own. When I cook good food or bring home something to eat / drink my wife loves, she\u2019s quite ecstatic and it shows.", "The US has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world though so there\u2019s that\u2026", "That just sucks. After my uk c section I was wheeled out of the operating room with my baby balanced on my chest and immediately given a cheese sandwich", "That\u2019s great! Everyone I know who has delivered in a hospital in my area (SE USA) has been told they could not eat. I hope the tide turns here too then.", "Mine told me that vegan snacks were fine. Claimed it's worse to aspirate animal products. Idk if that's true", "That sounds glorious. I would have happily eaten a raw hamburger at that point, I was so hungry. I do not understand the US obsession with avoiding the risk of lawsuits over patient wellbeing. My poor husband was in the hospital for 4 days with pancreatitis and wasn't allowed to eat solids for three despite the evidence for this approach being outdated and largely debunked."]}
