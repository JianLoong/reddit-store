Our dinner conversation eventually led to where I want to go for college and how to pay for it. Uncle David told me that the uncles decided long ago they were going to pay for me and sis\u2019s tuition and cost of living on campus. I cried when I heard that and laughed when he jokingly said he hope I don\u2019t get into medical school because that\u2019s going to cost him a fortune.\n\nI went home and excitedly told mom and Bob that the uncles are going to pay for our colleges. Instead of being happy, they both looked furious and Bob started screaming about how unfair it was to our step siblings and half sister that we\u2019re getting a free ride through college. He wanted me to tell our uncles to divided the college funds equally among the kids but I refused. The next day he kept on screaming at us so sis and I packed our bags to go to Uncle David\u2019s house. He kept on screaming and even followed us out to my car.\n\nSis and I have been living Uncle David and his family ever since. This feels more like home that it ever did at our house.
