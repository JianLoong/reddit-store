Our dad died about 10 years ago. It was sudden and devastating. One day he kissed and hugged me and sis and told us he loved us and then we never heard from him again. At the time I couldn\u2019t fully grasped why he chose to stay away even though mom tried to explain it to us. I missed him and thought I did something wrong to make dad mad. I repeatedly called his phone hoping he would answer but it always went directly to his voicemail.\n\nAt his funeral, I realized I would never see him again and I broke down. I don\u2019t remember much from that day except Uncle David held me the entire time. He held me throughout the funeral, during the drive home, and as I fell asleep that night. Uncle Alan did the same thing with sis.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy growing up with just my mom and sis but not as tough as it could have been because the two uncles were always a phone call away. Whenever we needed help with school, one of the uncles was there to tutor us. One of them was always in the front row of every school performance and game. Whenever I wake up in the middle of the night and miss dad, I\u2019ll call Uncle David and know he\u2019ll always pick up.\n\nMy mom eventually remarried to Bob. I never liked Bob because he always have to be in control and placed us on a strict schedule. Dinner was at 7 everyday no matter what. If we came home late and dinner was over, we weren\u2019t allowed to eat that night. Whenever our uncles gave me and sis money, we had to give it to Bob and he divided the money equally.\n\nA couple of months ago, sis and I were eating with Uncle David and his family. Our dinner conversation eventually led to where I want to go for college and how to pay for it. Uncle David told me that the uncles decided long ago they were going to pay for me and sis\u2019s tuition and cost of living on campus. I cried when I heard that and laughed when he jokingly said he hope I don\u2019t get into medical school because that\u2019s going to cost him a fortune.\n\nI went home and excitedly told mom and Bob that the uncles are going to pay for our colleges. Instead of being happy, they both looked furious and Bob started screaming about how unfair it was to our step siblings and half sister that we\u2019re getting a free ride through college. He wanted me to tell our uncles to divided the college funds equally among the kids but I refused. The next day he kept on screaming at us so sis and I packed our bags to go to Uncle David\u2019s house. He kept on screaming and even followed us out to my car.\n\nSis and I have been living Uncle David and his family ever since. This feels more like home that it ever did at our house. Mom has been asking us to come home for Christmas for a month now and I\u2019ve been refusing. Today is the 24th and she\u2019s been calling all morning crying and saying how we need to spend Christmas with family.\n\nAm I wrong for not spending Christmas with mom?", "created_utc": 1671888340, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu9skp/aita_for_not_going_to_my_moms_house_for_christmas/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Im going to assume your Uncles are the brother's of your father? You did the right thing. You and your sister were subjected to a guy that really doesnt give  a shit about you and is more interested in giving what you have to his kids. Your mother let it happen. Stay at your uncles. They've been there for you all your lives, and its clear they love you guys so much. Your mother sounds like when she married Bob, she chose her new family over the one she already had, and the two kids that had lost their dad.\n\nIm sorry for your loss. I hope  things work out for you and your sister, and you succeed in life. Im sure your dad is very proud of you, where ever he may be.", "NTA. Denying you food simply because you missed the dinner bell is abusive.

He is way out of line and I'm glad to hear that you managed to live with your Uncle.\nYour Mom and Bob need to respect some very much needed boundaries or NC would be a good alternative.", "Your uncles sound like absolute stars, I'm happy for you & your sister that you have both of them in your life.

If the latter, Bob has been stealing from you both all this time. NTA in the slightest.", "NTA \n\nYour mom chose a controlling and verbally abusive man over her own kids.

You\u2019re 17 you\u2019re almost an adult but your sister need her guardianship switched over to the uncle so Bob and mom won\u2019t cause trouble for your uncle.", "NTA. Bob sure sounds like one. You two will have a happier Christmas with your Uncle.", "NTA.  Christmas is, IMHO, about family, however one defines it.  Bob is not family.  He is the dictator to whom your mother surrendered.  Since your mother will not defend you and would not do so for years, and since your uncles have always done so, you are in the best position to decide where and who your truest family is.  I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your father and for the disappearance of your mother, but glad the uncles were there for you.  You know now with utter clarity that Bob will always bully you to give up what you get from your family in favor of his offspring.

Don't go and enjoy your Christmas with your real family (i.e. your uncles and their families). As you said, family is where you feel at home, and your mom and Bob clearly don't make you feel that.

At home with your uncles. You don't need to go back someplace that caused you so much pain and suffering. And Bob sounds horrific. I wouldn't go either. Christmas is about love and joy. Neither of which they provide.", "NTA. Bob is abusive.", "The only middle ground could be to ask Uncle David whether your mom (and just your mom) could come over for Christmas dinner?
