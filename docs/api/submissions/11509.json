He passes my house to go to theirs.\n\nBefore he moved,there were talks about us going to lunch with his parents as a celebration.  Unfortunately they fell ill and it didn't happen\n\nToday I went shopping, I felt quite moody,like something was off, he's been a little distant the past couple days but I haven't talked to him about it as I wanted to give him space and see if he comes around. While shopping I decide to treat us but I needed to know his boys sizes so call him. He forwards my call.  this is triggering for me, I try to push past it and distract myself with shopping and send him a message asking the sizes instead.  All is well, anxiety drops, over it, he messages about 20 mins later saying he's sorry he missed me and tells me the sizes. I leave him to it.\n\nWe FT in the evening and he mentions he went to get bikes from his parents.  I didnt think anything of it as I was out until he mentions the time (I was home by then and he knew it) so I got a little upset that he didn't stop by for a passing kiss.  He gave excuses that he had the boys in car and getting them in and out would have been a pain, I said idve come outside quickly for 2 mins.  He said it was just a quick thing after he went to lunch with his parents and didnt wanna mention it to me because his mum asked that I don't come and he wanted to protect my feelings. But then explains that its nothing personal to me his mum misses the boys and wanted quality time etc. \n\nThis would have been fine, I would have understood.  Im pissed off it was hidden. He's known for days that this was happening and hasn't mentioned anything and said he wasn't going to bring it up which pissed me off even more because I believe transparency is important in a relationship. I said I felt triggered and knew something was up, which could have been avoided if he'd just spoken to me about it.  He said I was crossing a boundary expecting him to pick up every call.  I said I didnt call back or blow up his phone or get angry etc.  All id like is a quick \"can I call you later? I'm busy at the moment\" or a quick message, rather than forwarding my call (obviously there are exceptions) which i think is respectful and considerate of your partner. But of course he forwarded my call as he didnt want me finding out I was excluded from the plans. he denies this and says its unrealistic to know each others where abouts all the time and having to know what each other is upto all the time.\n\nAm I overreacting or do I have a right to be pretty pissed off that this wasn't mentioned to me?", "created_utc": 1677979827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ijnip/aita_for_being_annoyed_my_bf_hid_that_he_went_to/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Demanding to dictate when someone tells you about their plans and activities is controlling and not your place to decide. \n\nYou're entitled to your feelings, of course, but your boyfriend did nothing wrong.

But I want to congratulate you on escaping your abuser and wish you luck in your recovery journey.  <3\n\nThe problem is, it sounds like you are relying on your boyfriend to manage your anxiety.  This is not healthy.\n\nYou seem to get anxious whenever he doesn't respond immediately or doesn't respond in the way you would like. He didn't answer his phone, but he did respond back within the hour, which is more than reasonable. Yes this triggers you, but just because you are triggered does not mean he did something wrong.\n\nYou also seem upset when he isn't giving you attention at every opportunity.  Yes, it would have been nice if he had stopped by the house to say hello to you as he passed it, but he had other things to concentrate on, and he isn't obliged to pause what he's doing just to say hello at every opportunity.\n\nAlso, if he feels the need to lie about having lunch with his parents... that tells me he's pretty anxious about how you would react if he told the truth.  Which means you may need to take a closer look at your own behavior and whether or not you are understanding boundaries and healthy communication skills\n\nYou need to work with your therapist (if you have one, and if not, you should get one if you can find one and can afford it).  Your therapist can help you learn coping strategies to manage your anxiety on your own without your boyfriend's help.", "YTA\n\nYou said triggered so much my brain hurts \n\nAlso he is an adult he doesn't need to tell you everything he does he didn't hide it he just didn't tell you and I get lies by omission but it's to his parents...

You have expectations about being involved in every and anything that I\u2019m just not sure are realistic for any relationship. Ive been married over 25 years, love my wife dearly, and I\u2019d be pushing back on her for this kind of constant pinging. I mean\u2026. Getting upset he isn\u2019t stopping for a \u201cpassing kiss\u201d driving by your home? Cmon now.\n\nYTA. I do hope some reflection would help you realize that.

I don\u2019t know your past but I am trying to say this kindly, you need to manage your triggers better. I sincerely hope you\u2019re receiving help.

You are in fact overreacting. \n\nFor a healthy relationship, you are asking too much. Would it be nice if he had given you a head\u2019s up? Yes. But based on your post I can\u2019t help but wonder if your general attitude and reactions aren\u2019t the reason he failed to mention it until after the fact (but note he actually did tell you).

You need to learn to get over your past relationship and experiences without requiring your loved one to pick up every call or send a message back straight away.\n\nPouting because he didn't stop at your house so you could come out and kiss him sounds over the top as well.\n\nYou're creating an environment where your bf will feel like he's walking on eggshells. If he misses a call because he's taking a shower, is he going to become anxious that you'll be upset? If he wants to visit his parents, will he always have to stop by for a kiss? That's exhausting.\n\nYou will push him away.\n\nI also think you were looking for an excuse to fall out with him you admit you were in a mood and then created a narrative around why he caused your mood.

I have a great husband and part of the reason he's great is he went to counseling during a period when his anxiety was through the roof. He was always texting me, always waking me up to give me a kiss goodbye knowing it have terrible insomnia, and was generally clingy and smothering. On the surface it sounds romantic but it was all rooted in his anxiety and very stressful for me. You mention that he seems distant lately, it may not be distance but what might be considered normal space? I don't know how well we'd be doing now if we weren't able to really sit down, talk, and agree that it was his turn to see the counselor (I've had so much therapy but this one wasn't about me).

Hopefully you have a good therapist to help you work on it. \n\nWhat is inappropriate, is externalizing it the way you're doing with your partner. You know you have outsized reactions to normal things sometimes. The answer to that, is not to try to manage your partner's behavior.

There's nothing inherently terrible in that. \n\nJust from the number of reactions you've described in your post to relatively minor, relatively normal behaviors of your partner....I fully get why he didn't tell you that he was meeting his parents.

I say this with all the love in the world: You shouldn't be using your partner to manage your anxiety/triggers. He gets to be a normal guy, doing normal stuff. He shouldn't have to feel badly about that because you have issues you're working through. \n\nSometimes one of the things that happens to us when we've been through trauma, is we try to control others to calm ourselves.

The fact that he kept it secret and didn't want to tell you that his mom uninvited you seem like red flags to me. From your description, you tried to handle the anxiety you were feeling on your own without going overboard with calling and texting him a bunch. The fact that his mom is trying to split you from him seems like it could be the start of an ongoing issue if she won't allow you to be a part of their \"quality time\" together.

OP has anxiety and acknowledges points where that may be relevant and is working on it. \n2. OP has described a range of reactions that seem appropriate to me.

The question OP asked was if they had a right to be pissed over the lack of communication.\n\nFor me ackno\u0175edging and owning one's issues gets brownie points, especially to this community.

All he had to do was inform her of the situation, prior to lunch, during lunch or even straight forward after the event, and yet he hid it from her and lied.\n\nThat is not to say that she is blameless here, there are definitely things to work on on her part and his behaviour was probably not malicious but an attempt to protect her feelings and or avoid needless confrontation.\n\nStill, NTA in my opinion", "I do get where you are coming from. Him not being up front about the plans he knew he had in the first place is not great and he could have texted you saying he was busy instead of ignoring your call with no explanation. He also could have just let it ring and gotten back to you later. It\u2019s a little rude to cut the call without a follow up- \u201cbusy call you later\u201d. But he did respond to your text promptly so there\u2019s that. \n\nComing by for a kiss is a bit cringey. He does not need to do that. Also his mom asking you not to come is genuinely hurtful. It\u2019s her right and I don\u2019t blame her but it would sting. \n\nHe is not blameless here and he did deliberately hide plans. He shouldn\u2019t be doing that.

You would be totally justified in being annoyed and directly telling him \u201cbabe i don\u2019t really appreciate you hiding a simple lunch with your parents from me, it\u2019s a little weird\u201d then moving on. It\u2019s the really dramatic reaction you had that makes you TA here.", "Obviously going against the grain here. NTA\n\nYour response to the call being forwarded and him not stopping for a kiss seem unwarranted. It doesn't make you an AH, because sometimes our trauma responses don't resurface until we're in a relationship and see them. Now that you know this is happening though it's on you to address it. More therapy is needed.\n\nHowever, him keeping the meal with his parents a secret is AH behavior on his part, and I completely understand your reaction in this respect. It'd be one thing if it just didn't come up or he didnt think to mention it, but it'd honestly be a deal-breaker for me if my SO was deliberately hiding things, even if it was as mundane as lunch with his mom.", "Lied by omission, if you were clear with transparency.", "I will go with NTA, he knew you would want to go too, and would be sad about not going. but you are adults and could have just talked about it together.

He passes my house to go to theirs.\n\nBefore he moved,there were talks about us going to lunch with his parents as a celebration.  Unfortunately they fell ill and it didn't happen\n\nToday I went shopping, I felt quite moody,like something was off, he's been a little distant the past couple days but I haven't talked to him about it as I wanted to give him space and see if he comes around. While shopping I decide to treat us but I needed to know his boys sizes so call him. He forwards my call.  this is triggering for me, I try to push past it and distract myself with shopping and send him a message asking the sizes instead.  All is well, anxiety drops, over it, he messages about 20 mins later saying he's sorry he missed me and tells me the sizes. I leave him to it.\n\nWe FT in the evening and he mentions he went to get bikes from his parents.  I didnt think anything of it as I was out until he mentions the time (I was home by then and he knew it) so I got a little upset that he didn't stop by for a passing kiss.  He gave excuses that he had the boys in car and getting them in and out would have been a pain, I said idve come outside quickly for 2 mins.  He said it was just a quick thing after he went to lunch with his parents and didnt wanna mention it to me because his mum asked that I don't come and he wanted to protect my feelings. But then explains that its nothing personal to me his mum misses the boys and wanted quality time etc. \n\nThis would have been fine, I would have understood.  Im pissed off it was hidden. He's known for days that this was happening and hasn't mentioned anything and said he wasn't going to bring it up which pissed me off even more because I believe transparency is important in a relationship. I said I felt triggered and knew something was up, which could have been avoided if he'd just spoken to me about it.  He said I was crossing a boundary expecting him to pick up every call.  I said I didnt call back or blow up his phone or get angry etc.  All id like is a quick \"can I call you later? I'm busy at the moment\" or a quick message, rather than forwarding my call (obviously there are exceptions) which i think is respectful and considerate of your partner. But of course he forwarded my call as he didnt want me finding out I was excluded from the plans. he denies this and says its unrealistic to know each others where abouts all the time and having to know what each other is upto all the time.\n\nAm I overreacting or do I have a right to be pretty pissed off that this wasn't mentioned to me?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However the behavior she is exhibiting is very much abusive behavior.  She is being extremely controlling. She is stating that he is not allowed to ignore her calls and needs to answer and tell her he'll call her back.  She said she needs to be told about all his plans ahead of time.

It's not friendly for the environment either. Gee, OP is such an entitled brat, getting annoyed because he isn't on his phone 24/7, I would dump her.", ">They specifically requested to spend time with her boys, your bf didn't want to upset you by saying that which tbh is a kind thing to do.\n\n\nEh.... is it kind tho? \n\nOk, he didn't want to upset her. But like, it doesn't sound like it was a \"ew, don't invite OP,\" moment? It was simply a \"I want to prioritize my grandsons\" moment. \n\nIt also sounds like the celebratory lunch was a more formalized plan than just talks since not only did it not happen specifically because the bf's parents got sick, but the mom thought she had to specify that this was a grandparents/grandsons thing and not an invite the gf thing. That's not just a lack of committed planning. And the move was only a few weeks ago so the plan was probably put on hold rather than canceled. \n\nThe kinder thing would've been to just tell her low-key, \"hey guess what? My parents are feeling better and have been missing the boys. They wanna spend time with them before we all get together\" \n\nIt sounds like they're in contact and see each other pretty often. I def wouldn't say either of them are obligated to share every and any social plan, but like, if you're gonna feel awkward about it like the bf clearly did? \n\nProbably gonna create more problems than less.

You sound controlling and, as others have said, exhausting. \n\nI'm sure you are a wonderful person in many ways, but you mentioned he's been distant the last few days. Ever consider you are driving him away with this type of behavior? I get you have past trauma, but you are taking that past trauma and making it his problem and making him decide whether or not a relationship with you is worth dealing with someone who very clearly has serious trust issues and possible control issues.

Can (or can't, whichever applies) text.\"\n\nBecause that's his normal and most consistent mode by his own preference, when/if he doesn't do that, yeah, it's likely I'll be thinking there might be a problem. Might be a situational problem for him (emergency, hurt, etc), or might be a problem between us. \n\nI'd hold off on calling OP on asshole for this specific behavior since 1. we don't know bf's normal response to not being able to talk and 2. her only actions specifically related to this aspect of the situation was to send a follow-up text.

So rather than something being a matter deserving of open communication and compromise (I don't really like it when you decline my calls), it becomes an issue that doesn't allow for her partner to ask for any kind of compromise or understanding of his own needs or expectations (it's triggering to me if you decline my calls).\n\nI wouldn't stick around for that.", "INFO: How long have you been dating", "If you don\u2019t see this as wrong, then there\u2019s probably a whole slew of other things.\n\nYTA", "You being upset that he \u201chid\u201d it from you & expecting him to stop by for a \u201cpassing kiss\u201d is being overbearing.

For example, my anxiety is very bad, and on a bad day nearly anything could trigger it at any second. They've been through trauma, and that it gets worse on bad days. I will say that it's not OP's boyfriend's duty to take care of OP, and make sure he doesn't trigger them. It's so, so easy to trigger an anxious and upset person, and that's when said person needs to own up to their actions, apologising later, etc. For example: \"I'm really sorry I yelled at you earlier today, I was really stressed, and I was struggling to keep control of the  situation. You did nothing wrong, and I was overthinking\" Boom. It's not that hard. \n\nGo to therapy if you haven't already OP.
