We also lived there with my boyfriend (M30) and my dad (M58) Her and I legally owned the home as we had the best credit and I had the money for the down payment. \n\nCut to now my parents are getting a divorce. The plan is for me, my boyfriend, and my mom to get a smaller place together. My father is upset he has to get his own place and can\u2019t live with us. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m taking my mom\u2019s side or anything, I don\u2019t have any problems living with my mother, but even before the divorce I was regretting moving in with my dad. I\u2019ve included a list of issues. \n\nHe\u2019s DIRTY! He literally makes entire rooms smell from his body odor, he leaves actual poop stains on toilet seats so often I had to start locking my bathroom door. He leaves crumbs literally all over the couch to the point we\u2019ve gotten ants. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t do much around the house chore wise. He does dishes half the time but he does them so badly we often to have to re-clean them (we don\u2019t have a dishwasher so it\u2019s all by hand) He puts dishes up wet and refuses to let them dry. The worst part is he flat out has stated he feels he does the most in the house! Even though he\u2019s never cleaned a toilet, never once has swept or mopped, doesn\u2019t take care of the dogs, has never done yard work. He doesn\u2019t even run his own errands, I do all that for him and take him to all his appointments and such. I do ALL the shopping, picking up meds, etc. This man literally only has to do one load of dishes a day and take out the kitchen trash AT MOST. Meanwhile the rest of us are taking care of the whole house. \n\nHe\u2019s loud and he\u2019s rude. He will burp throughout the house super loudly, like I can\u2019t even explain how loud it is. I\u2019ve begged him to try and keep it down, but he knows it upsets people and finds it funny. I\u2019m literally almost 30 and terrified to have friends over in my own home because he\u2019ll burp and make a scene. I was trying to relax with a friend on my birthday and he kept screaming down the stairs demanding I help him with setting up a tv streaming service he wanted. \n\nHe gets mad at me when I turn a light off. I have chronic headaches made worse by light, yet I get yelled at for having lights off in MY space downstairs. \n\nThe uglier side to this is I\u2019ve been coming to terms with the realization that my father was very emotionally abusive when I was a child. He would use me as a therapist and put way too much info on me, to the point I started having panic attacks at age 8. He also screamed at me a lot when he would help with my homework when my mom was working. He called me stupid all the time, and once he screamed so loud at me over my math homework I peed my pants when I was around 10. I\u2019ve never told ANYONE this. \n\nHe has horrible credit and will most likely have to rent a room with roommates at best or be homeless at worst. I can\u2019t shake the feeling I\u2019m doing something wrong.
