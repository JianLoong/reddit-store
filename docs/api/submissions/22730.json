What does that mean for you? Well, we\u2019re lucky enough to have vibrant community awards, many of which are used by you to award your favorite posts and comments. Each time you\u2019ve bequeathed a [Poop Knife, a Diamond in the Poo, a Golden Throne](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/awardarchive), or any of our other glorious custom awards to another user, as well as indulging the display of a beautiful asshole-flavored icon, the mod team has been tithed some coins to bestow via special mod awards. With awards now disappearing, *including retroactively*, that means we have **several hundred** of these special awards to give away, and not much time left to do it.  \n\nWe were thinking about fun ways to make a difference, and when it came down to it, we realized that a good way to memorialize the loss of our awards and subreddit history, is to remember that [just like Reddit\u2019s admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14dd0ae/askhistorians_will_remain_in_limited_operation/), *we're all the Asshole sometimes*. So, here is what we propose: \n\n**Tell us in the comments about a time** ***you*** **were the asshole. Keep it short, simple, and** [**non-violent**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what_types_of_posts_are_covered_by_rule_5.3F)**.** \n\nWhile supplies last, we\u2019ll crown your glorious repentance with a special Golden Asshole award created by the amazing u/bvbblegvmbitch just for this sendoff award thread.\n\nUnfortunately, you won't be able to see it on your comment after awards go away on September 12th.

Didn't tell me what, just that it was to honor me. As the day came closer, I couldn't stand the thought of being celebrated by someone I knew I would break up with. So earlier that day I went to her and broke things off.\n\nTurns out she wanted to celebrate my birthday exactly half a year after I couldn't celebrate it for Corona reasons. Sweetest thing she ever did... And I repaid her by breaking things off. Hate myself for that timing.\n\nShe still gave me a card and presents. Found the card again today, and finally threw it out since I'm moving. \n\nThat timing is almost as bad as the girl I broke things up with on the day of one of the biggest muslim holidays, without even knowing. \n\nI think both breakups were justified, but the timing makes me the AH..", "As a kid, I once got so mad at my sibling that I waited until they went to bed and then used their toothbrush to scrub the toilet (but then felt so guilty about it that I threw it out before they could use it the next morning).

So, I let it out. It was a silent one and the smell was evil. The guy immediately reacted and yelled at me before others  could smell it. I at first pretended like I couldn't smell anything and like I was absolutely baffled at the accusations.  Everyone thought he'd done it and was just trying to blame me so as not to embarass himself.

I then decided to expose my lie to him ; the friend I was going to bring was actually a girl and I was very confident they would hook up as they *really* have a lot in common. I decided to hide that from Jim because he's sometimes shy and I thought he might not want to come if I told him it was a girl.\n\nAfter some brief thought, Jim suddenly started criticising me for \"misleading\" him. I told Jim I had the best intentions, and his criticism became much harsher and he started swearing at me.

He'd already sprayed his hateful panic juice all over the carrier, the seat, and the carpet. It was absolutely rancid.

It had an indoor pool where the balconies of the rooms overlooked the pool.  Our balcony just happened to be slightly over the pool.  I met this kid in the hotel with his family and together we strategized on how to poop in the pool from the balcony.  We were 2 delinquint troublemakers with too much time on our hands and way too little adult supervision.\n\nHe had to go to the bathroom first and emerged with his turd on a paper plate.  He speared it with a plastic fork.  We went to the balcony and giggling like little girls, he pushed it off the plate, landing in the water with a plop where it sank to the bottom.\n\nWe laughed so hard for 20+ minutes as nobody noticed it.  It was laying on the bottom of the pool like a landmine waiting for someone to approach it.  People got close to it, our hesitation arose but they moved away unwittingly.  Eventually this old lady stepped firmly into it.  She didnt know what it was at first but once she realized, started shrieking.  Everyone immediately knew there was shit in the water and they booked out of the pool faster than if you said Jaws was swimming in that water\n\nThe old lady made it out of the water, up the stairs and was hopping over to where a hose/faucet was to rinse off her foot.  She was so angry and shaking her foot furiously trying to dislodge the poop from between her toes.  There was a group of young guys playing cards who were laughing their asses off.  They had to put their cards on the table, it was impossible for them to play any longer due to the laughter.  Somehow a young boy was blamed for it and he was crying with everyone giving him side eye (sorry to that young boy wherever you are).  Everyone was out of the water with arms folded angry they couldnt use the pol anymore.  By now, we were laughing so hard, our sides were hurting.  I dont think anybody blamed us and no repurcussions were ever felt by us.

We go in and I heartily recommend the Filet O\u2019Fish (he\u2019s a Hindu, right?). This poor guy eats a Filet O\u2019Fish for months on end. One day I go to get something to eat and he tags along. I order a Big Mac meal. So does he. Come to find out he was Christian, not Hindu, and could have been eating anything all that time.

Every day. Good I didn't eat, didn't ask for and didn't want. After asking nicely, asking firmly, flat out starting and then demanding her to stop I finally lost it on her and made her cry. Enough that she has to go home for the day.\n\nI did not feel bad\n\nETA: let me add that this was food she would buy from whatever restaurant she was eating at that day, but did from home.

There was no chocolate sauce and the timing was such that it had to go out in 10 minutes. All there was was a pile of chocolate that had to be melted.  \nIdeally, to make chocolate sauce, you put a metal bowl over hot or boiling water and grate the chocolate into it. Once melted, you add things like cream, butter - cant remember tbh.  \nBut that cant be done with that quantity in that time. No chance.\n\nLuckily, in my 'enhanced' state, the answer was obvious.
