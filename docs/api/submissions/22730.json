What does that mean for you? Well, we\u2019re lucky enough to have vibrant community awards, many of which are used by you to award your favorite posts and comments. Each time you\u2019ve bequeathed a [Poop Knife, a Diamond in the Poo, a Golden Throne](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/awardarchive), or any of our other glorious custom awards to another user, as well as indulging the display of a beautiful asshole-flavored icon, the mod team has been tithed some coins to bestow via special mod awards. With awards now disappearing, *including retroactively*, that means we have **several hundred** of these special awards to give away, and not much time left to do it.  \n\nWe were thinking about fun ways to make a difference, and when it came down to it, we realized that a good way to memorialize the loss of our awards and subreddit history, is to remember that [just like Reddit\u2019s admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14dd0ae/askhistorians_will_remain_in_limited_operation/), *we're all the Asshole sometimes*. So, here is what we propose: \n\n**Tell us in the comments about a time** ***you*** **were the asshole. Keep it short, simple, and** [**non-violent**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what_types_of_posts_are_covered_by_rule_5.3F)**.** \n\nWhile supplies last, we\u2019ll crown your glorious repentance with a special Golden Asshole award created by the amazing u/bvbblegvmbitch just for this sendoff award thread.\n\nUnfortunately, you won't be able to see it on your comment after awards go away on September 12th.

I then decided to expose my lie to him ; the friend I was going to bring was actually a girl and I was very confident they would hook up as they *really* have a lot in common. I decided to hide that from Jim because he's sometimes shy and I thought he might not want to come if I told him it was a girl.\n\nAfter some brief thought, Jim suddenly started criticising me for \"misleading\" him.

We were 2 delinquint troublemakers with too much time on our hands and way too little adult supervision.\n\nHe had to go to the bathroom first and emerged with his turd on a paper plate.  He speared it with a plastic fork.  We went to the balcony and giggling like little girls, he pushed it off the plate, landing in the water with a plop where it sank to the bottom.\n\nWe laughed so hard for 20+ minutes as nobody noticed it.  It was laying on the bottom of the pool like a landmine waiting for someone to approach it.  People got close to it, our hesitation arose but they moved away unwittingly.  Eventually this old lady stepped firmly into it.  She didnt know what it was at first but once she realized, started shrieking.  Everyone immediately knew there was shit in the water and they booked out of the pool faster than if you said Jaws was swimming in that water\n\nThe old lady made it out of the water, up the stairs and was hopping over to where a hose/faucet was to rinse off her foot.  She was so angry and shaking her foot furiously trying to dislodge the poop from between her toes.  There was a group of young guys playing cards who were laughing their asses off.  They had to put their cards on the table, it was impossible for them to play any longer due to the laughter.  Somehow a young boy was blamed for it and he was crying with everyone giving him side eye (sorry to that young boy wherever you are).  Everyone was out of the water with arms folded angry they couldnt use the pol anymore.  By now, we were laughing so hard, our sides were hurting.  I dont think anybody blamed us and no repurcussions were ever felt by us.

There was no chocolate sauce and the timing was such that it had to go out in 10 minutes. All there was was a pile of chocolate that had to be melted.  \nIdeally, to make chocolate sauce, you put a metal bowl over hot or boiling water and grate the chocolate into it. Once melted, you add things like cream, butter - cant remember tbh.  \nBut that cant be done with that quantity in that time. No chance.\n\nLuckily, in my 'enhanced' state, the answer was obvious.
