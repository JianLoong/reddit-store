When I went to vital records they said they can't make changes to any birth certificates without court documents for a name change from our state. I had to apply for a name change with the state which cost  something like $250 and then take it back to vital records and pay for new birth certificates to submit to social security.

I couldn't get his health insurance until he was 6 months old and the back coverage was only 3 months so I ended up paying out of pocket for the first 3 months of visits plus vaccines.
