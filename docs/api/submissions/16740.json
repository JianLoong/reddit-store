This has been the set up for the past two years and my girls get along really well with their cousin and she\u2019s also well behaved so it\u2019s not too much extra work on my part and I\u2019m happy to help out.\n\nMy husband\u2019s other sibling, my SIL Sara (34F), has a son (9M) Jack. Sara is a single mom to Jack and doesn\u2019t get much support from his dad. It\u2019s really hard on her because Jack is autistic and requires a lot of special attention and has behavioral issues. I know it\u2019s not his fault that he\u2019s autistic, but he absolutely terrorizes my daughters and my other niece and Sara never tries to intervene and just expects everyone to accommodate.\n\nFor example, he\u2019s a lot larger than the girls so he\u2019ll frequently sit on them and push them down if they don\u2019t want to play with him, he\u2019ll throw around their toys and break them when he gets upset, he has pulled my nieces hair and scratched her when she beat him in a board game to the point that she started bleeding. Sara just says that\u2019s how he is and there\u2019s nothing she can do because of his condition. Because of this, my husband and I have decided to not have our daughters spend much time with Jack until he is older or Sara is able to better help him with his needs because it is putting them at risk by being around him.\n\nRecently, Sara asked me to also look after Jack since I\u2019m a SAHM and already babysit my niece after school, so one more kid shouldn\u2019t be much. I politely told her no and explained that 1) I don\u2019t want to have to be responsible and manage Jack\u2019s outbreaks and 2) he has hurt my daughters and my niece many times before and I don\u2019t want to bring any potential harm into my home.\n\nI know it was harsh but she absolutely blew up on me for choosing favorites with my niece and BIL\u2019s family, blocked me on social media, and went on Facebook to rant about how certain people in her family are ableist and refuse to step up and help her in times of need which was obviously directed at me.

In a support group I met another mother and thought we could exchange childcare. BUT.. Her child was two years older and prone to meltdowns where my child was extremely introverted and when things don't go his was would hide in his closet. I had to end the relationship. Her son would injure mine in his meltdowns. And she wouldn't allow me to deploy de-escalation tactics my son's behavioral therapist trained me for that work great. Just couldn't manage him.\n\nHe is bigger then your kids, several years older then the other cousins and if your SIL doesn't have him in therapy to learn how to deal with his meltdowns don't take this on. Its just going to end in extreme family discord and possibly traumatic experiences that will have your children in therapy for years.", "NTA. You're not playing favorites if your own children are getting hurt to the point they BLEED when he is around. Your sister in law is immature for blasting you on Facebook. She should maybe focus her energy on obtaining support from Jack's dad, even if it means taking his ass to court!", "NTA. You aren't playing favorites or being abelist. Jack is abusive to your children, special needs or not, and you have to look out for them first.", "NTA. Sara is lashing out because she has a need for free childcare and doesn't like that you said no. I don't think you owe her any further explanation. At the end of the day, you have to protect your own kids and the kid you are already responsible for watching. Jack, while I understand is autistic, poses a threat to their safety. Beyond that, I personally think asking you to watch 4 kids on your own is a big ask. Heck, I watch my 2 nieces and I don't think I could handle another one without help.", "NTA....your SIL is a crap parent.  Your daughters and their (f) cousin's safety is top priority.", "NTA - I empathize with both parties but Sara, despite the heavy parent load she carries, is not helping her son. She is not aware of (or choses not to) create consistent interventions. These should be so second nature that she can demonstrate and explain them to anyone. Stating, \"...that's how it is... it's just his condition.\" is no OK.\n\nYou have every right to make safety a priority in your home. You also do not need to be bullied into taking on their responsibility. Since you're on blast now is the time for anyone siding with her to take on her babysitting needs.", "NTA \n\nNot everyone can handle kids with special needs. They need special people who can tend to those special needs. I would have done the same thing. That is stress that I cannot handle, so I don\u2019t blame you. You\u2019re not choosing favorites, you\u2019re choosing safety. I understand that he\u2019s autistic but that doesn\u2019t give him a free pass and she needs to realize that and take accountability for it. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what she\u2019s going through, but she should be understanding of why you are unable to accommodate.", "NTA. You\u2019ve taken care of your nephew before or had him over and his behavior is unacceptable. Sure he\u2019s on the spectrum but doesn\u2019t absolve him from getting his behavior corrected. Your SIL refuses to correct this and believes it\u2019s still your responsibility or duty to help her with her kid? Hell no. Even if we assume your nephew is an angel it\u2019s still not your responsibility to look after anyone\u2019s kid. When someone becomes a parent they\u2019ve made a choice to raise and care for a kid regardless of how they may come out and it\u2019s up to them to have a plan ready to go anything less is just irresponsible.", "NTA-I\u2019m sorry your SIL is allowing her son\u2019s autism to be used as an excuse to not correct his behavior or get him help to learn how to manage his behavior but you aren\u2019t an asshole for refusing to babysit him when he\u2019s a danger to the children you have or are babysitting.", "NTA \n\nThe safety of the girls is paramount and he needs more intervention, watching, and assistance than you can provide", "NTA your first and only priority is the safety of your daughters.\n\nYour sil needs to realize if she chooses to take the easy way out of parenting her child, autistic or not, then no one is going to help.\n\nPlus 3 kids is already a lot of work.\nMuch less adding one with special needs into the mix. \n\nIgnore her ranting. However if she publicly boast you on social media then you have every right to defend your self by listing what you did here.\n\nNo one no matter what the situation is entitled to free babysitting", "NTA. Who does she think she is being so entitled like that. Her child has special needs and she therefore can\u2019t just expect other people to want to or know how to deal with that, your children are absolutely your priority, you do not owe her anything.", "NTA. I\u2019m on the spectrum and I had quirks that were difficult for some people, but these are straight up behavioral issues and Sara is ignoring them. She\u2019s doing a huge disservice to Jack which impacts everyone Jack may come in contact with.", "NTA.  It\u2019s tragic that Jack\u2019s mother seems to be making no effort to help her son integrate with other children, or supporting his development. She\u2019s the A-H.", "nta. your kids come first, as a parent it is your responsibility to keep them safe and your right to decline babysitting a special needs child.", "You have your hands full. So, NTA. Sara needs to seek services from her local school district and other community resources, if the child's father is no use. Again, NTA. You are caring for your kids and another family member's child as well. That has got to be enough without making you feel like the little old lady who lives in a shoe.", "NTA. Your reasoning is sound, she just doesn't like it.", "NTA. Stop giving this any consideration. I\u2019m sure your husband has already told you this.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry Jack\u2019s mom, and therefore Jack, is in a tough spot. But that is not your responsibility. Just because you watch one persons kids doesn\u2019t mean you have to watch everyone\u2019s kids.", "NTA. You know the limit of what you can deal with. \n\n>Sara just says that\u2019s how he is and there\u2019s nothing she can do because of his condition.\n\nThis is BS. Many people with autism LEARN how to function.  It doesn't just happen, but there are ways to help. Mom needs to get him help.", "NTA\n\nWhere you live are there any programs that specifically work with neurodivergent children that your nephew could benefit from?  Possibly even in a live in program?  \n\nI personally and sadly would not let your children or niece interact with Jack until he gets the help he should be entitled to so he can learn to handle his frustration in as positive/safe way as possible.  \n\nMy concern if he has no problem with taking out his frustration on the girls now how much worse will it be when hormones kick into the mix and he still has no help?  \n\nAlso this is so unfair to Jack who, if his mother keeps making excuses for him instead of finding a way to help him, will not only possibly be unwanted in any relative\u2019s home but could get him seriously hurt if he goes off on a stranger.", "NTA - You're not playing favorites, you are protecting the children you are watching! I get that he has difficulty controlling things, but that doesn't mean his difficulty controlling things goes away. You have to think of the kids that are going to be traumatized by this and take that into account far mor than your sister, sad as that is to say.", "If it is not much trouble to take care of 3 kids plus an extra special needs kid, then, I'm sure it's no trouble for her to take care of her one single special needs kid on her own.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA", "Definitely NTA as your first duty is protecting your children. Stand your ground as you are doing nothing wrong.", "NTA this has nothing to do with favorites it has to do with the other kids safety. If your sil can\u2019t  understand that reasoning that\u2019s her issue not yours.", "NTA. Protect your kids first. It\u2019s not okay to put them in a situation where they\u2019d be harmed. Also, no one is entitled to free babysitting. SIL is acting entitled and it\u2019s unreasonable.", "NTA. You are doing the responsible thing by saying no when you don\u2019t have the resources to watch Jack and the other kids at the same time. \n\nI hate when people throw around the term ableism. It wouldn\u2019t even be ableist to say no to watching Jack alone if you feel you are I equipped to care for him properly!", "One more kid, who is the equivalent of three kids, on top of the three you already have. Watching one niece for two hours is a kindness. SAHM/Ds are not neighborhood babysitters or nannies. I find that really rude tbh. Your partner is working so you can work to raise your kids, not so you can run a free day care. I think it insults you and your partner. Your nephew attacks your children. That's the end of the discussion. NTA. \n\n>went on Facebook to rant about how certain people in her family are ableist and refuse to step up and help her in times of need which was obviously directed at me.\n\nF Facebook.

However, autism is not an acceptable excuse to be violent with others or destructive. Autism doesn't give anyone a free pass. Yes, it's not his fault that he's autistic however it's moms duty to teach her child instead of being lazy and not engaged as she should be. You are making the right call for your own child and nieces. It's not fair to the girls to be forced to engage or deal with this behavior.

His parents neglected treatment and never got him help. as a child, he terrorized me and chased me around with a pew pew. no one did anything, and 20 years later, I can't be alone in a room with him. protect them and ensure that until he's getting treatment and being told how to behave, you won't watch him. \n\nnta", "NTA people that hurt your kids shouldn't be in their home.", "Also want to say on a recommendation of the other mother, after my child received his diagnosis I asked my son's doctor to recommend him for CPA support. Insurance doesn't always cover it but when they do you can get anywhere from 4 hours to three days a week of support depending on the doctor's recommendation and the insurance coverage.", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but honestly it\u2019s a comment rooted in ignorance of how child support really works in this country. If a father doesn\u2019t make much money, there\u2019s absolutely nothing that can be done. And there are men out there who deliberately work low paying jobs to pay as little child support as possible. (My ex did that and died owing every penny of child support, which was assessed at $50/month. He worked under the table so his wages couldn\u2019t be garnished.) The SIL is probably overwhelmed and isolated, but unfortunately she is hurting both her son and herself by refusing to acknowledge, let alone address, his behavioral issues which means she is increasingly the only person who can care for him. That\u2019s the problem she needs to focus on. \n\n(P.S. if the father does have resources, you\u2019re right - SIL needs a lawyer who will hound him until he ponies up.)", "I agree. She is doing her son such a disservice. Instead of helping him learn wrong from right and helping him to prevent meltdowns or deal with them in a better way, she is just making excuses. He is hurting younger smaller children and she only makes excuses. How the heck is he going to learn not to do that if he is always allowed to??", "My sister paid her way through college as a respite carer. It was a regularly scheduled gig so their caregivers could have a break. Her clients had limited mobility or had dementia or autism. She worked for an agency. The services were ofter covered by the patients Medicare or medicaid."]}
