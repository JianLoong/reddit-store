This has been the set up for the past two years and my girls get along really well with their cousin and she\u2019s also well behaved so it\u2019s not too much extra work on my part and I\u2019m happy to help out.\n\nMy husband\u2019s other sibling, my SIL Sara (34F), has a son (9M) Jack. Sara is a single mom to Jack and doesn\u2019t get much support from his dad. It\u2019s really hard on her because Jack is autistic and requires a lot of special attention and has behavioral issues. I know it\u2019s not his fault that he\u2019s autistic, but he absolutely terrorizes my daughters and my other niece and Sara never tries to intervene and just expects everyone to accommodate.\n\nFor example, he\u2019s a lot larger than the girls so he\u2019ll frequently sit on them and push them down if they don\u2019t want to play with him, he\u2019ll throw around their toys and break them when he gets upset, he has pulled my nieces hair and scratched her when she beat him in a board game to the point that she started bleeding. Sara just says that\u2019s how he is and there\u2019s nothing she can do because of his condition. Because of this, my husband and I have decided to not have our daughters spend much time with Jack until he is older or Sara is able to better help him with his needs because it is putting them at risk by being around him.\n\nRecently, Sara asked me to also look after Jack since I\u2019m a SAHM and already babysit my niece after school, so one more kid shouldn\u2019t be much. I politely told her no and explained that 1) I don\u2019t want to have to be responsible and manage Jack\u2019s outbreaks and 2) he has hurt my daughters and my niece many times before and I don\u2019t want to bring any potential harm into my home.\n\nI know it was harsh but she absolutely blew up on me for choosing favorites with my niece and BIL\u2019s family, blocked me on social media, and went on Facebook to rant about how certain people in her family are ableist and refuse to step up and help her in times of need which was obviously directed at me.

In a support group I met another mother and thought we could exchange childcare. BUT.. Her child was two years older and prone to meltdowns where my child was extremely introverted and when things don't go his was would hide in his closet. I had to end the relationship. Her son would injure mine in his meltdowns. And she wouldn't allow me to deploy de-escalation tactics my son's behavioral therapist trained me for that work great. Just couldn't manage him.\n\nHe is bigger then your kids, several years older then the other cousins and if your SIL doesn't have him in therapy to learn how to deal with his meltdowns don't take this on. Its just going to end in extreme family discord and possibly traumatic experiences that will have your children in therapy for years.", "NTA. You're not playing favorites if your own children are getting hurt to the point they BLEED when he is around. Your sister in law is immature for blasting you on Facebook.

Jack is abusive to your children, special needs or not, and you have to look out for them first.", "NTA. Sara is lashing out because she has a need for free childcare and doesn't like that you said no. I don't think you owe her any further explanation. At the end of the day, you have to protect your own kids and the kid you are already responsible for watching. Jack, while I understand is autistic, poses a threat to their safety. Beyond that, I personally think asking you to watch 4 kids on your own is a big ask. Heck, I watch my 2 nieces and I don't think I could handle another one without help.", "NTA....your SIL is a crap parent.  Your daughters and their (f) cousin's safety is top priority.", "NTA - I empathize with both parties but Sara, despite the heavy parent load she carries, is not helping her son. She is not aware of (or choses not to) create consistent interventions. These should be so second nature that she can demonstrate and explain them to anyone. Stating, \"...that's how it is... it's just his condition.\" is no OK.\n\nYou have every right to make safety a priority in your home.

Even if we assume your nephew is an angel it\u2019s still not your responsibility to look after anyone\u2019s kid. When someone becomes a parent they\u2019ve made a choice to raise and care for a kid regardless of how they may come out and it\u2019s up to them to have a plan ready to go anything less is just irresponsible.", "NTA-I\u2019m sorry your SIL is allowing her son\u2019s autism to be used as an excuse to not correct his behavior or get him help to learn how to manage his behavior but you aren\u2019t an asshole for refusing to babysit him when he\u2019s a danger to the children you have or are babysitting.", "NTA \n\nThe safety of the girls is paramount and he needs more intervention, watching, and assistance than you can provide", "NTA your first and only priority is the safety of your daughters.\n\nYour sil needs to realize if she chooses to take the easy way out of parenting her child, autistic or not, then no one is going to help.\n\nPlus 3 kids is already a lot of work.\nMuch less adding one with special needs into the mix. \n\nIgnore her ranting. However if she publicly boast you on social media then you have every right to defend your self by listing what you did here.\n\nNo one no matter what the situation is entitled to free babysitting", "NTA.

So, NTA. Sara needs to seek services from her local school district and other community resources, if the child's father is no use. Again, NTA.

You know the limit of what you can deal with. \n\n>Sara just says that\u2019s how he is and there\u2019s nothing she can do because of his condition.\n\nThis is BS.

Mom needs to get him help.", "NTA\n\nWhere you live are there any programs that specifically work with neurodivergent children that your nephew could benefit from?  Possibly even in a live in program?  \n\nI personally and sadly would not let your children or niece interact with Jack until he gets the help he should be entitled to so he can learn to handle his frustration in as positive/safe way as possible.  \n\nMy concern if he has no problem with taking out his frustration on the girls now how much worse will it be when hormones kick into the mix and he still has no help?  \n\nAlso this is so unfair to Jack who, if his mother keeps making excuses for him instead of finding a way to help him, will not only possibly be unwanted in any relative\u2019s home but could get him seriously hurt if he goes off on a stranger.", "NTA - You're not playing favorites, you are protecting the children you are watching! I get that he has difficulty controlling things, but that doesn't mean his difficulty controlling things goes away. You have to think of the kids that are going to be traumatized by this and take that into account far mor than your sister, sad as that is to say.", "If it is not much trouble to take care of 3 kids plus an extra special needs kid, then, I'm sure it's no trouble for her to take care of her one single special needs kid on her own.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA", "Definitely NTA as your first duty is protecting your children. Stand your ground as you are doing nothing wrong.", "NTA this has nothing to do with favorites it has to do with the other kids safety.

Also, no one is entitled to free babysitting. SIL is acting entitled and it\u2019s unreasonable.", "NTA. You are doing the responsible thing by saying no when you don\u2019t have the resources to watch Jack and the other kids at the same time. \n\nI hate when people throw around the term ableism. It wouldn\u2019t even be ableist to say no to watching Jack alone if you feel you are I equipped to care for him properly!", "One more kid, who is the equivalent of three kids, on top of the three you already have. Watching one niece for two hours is a kindness. SAHM/Ds are not neighborhood babysitters or nannies. I find that really rude tbh. Your partner is working so you can work to raise your kids, not so you can run a free day care. I think it insults you and your partner. Your nephew attacks your children.

And there are men out there who deliberately work low paying jobs to pay as little child support as possible.
