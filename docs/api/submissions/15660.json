{"id": 15660, "submission_id": "12yjly9", "title": "AITA for turning down a housing opportunity because they wouldn't let me have my dog there?", "selftext": "I can see my fianc\u00e9s side here but I don't actually think I'm wrong either way. So basically, my fianc\u00e9 and I became homeless 3 months ago (went to court and were kicked out due to falling behind on rent- totally justified but still sucked). We had fallen behind on rent because my fianc\u00e9 became pregnant and was put on partial bed rest due to placenta issues so she could no longer work (she worked at a warehouse). She had been searching for at home positions for two months leading up to the eviction but got essentially no where. I don't bring in enough to cover rent and due to the fact that we have two sons already (my step kids) I was **really** falling behind on payments. \n\nCurrently my fianc\u00e9 and I are staying in a camper on her mother's property and the kids usually stay inside with grandma because they want to. My fianc\u00e9 ended up having someone foster her cats, whereas I brought my dog with me. I will admit that she's not a fan of my dog due to some behaviors that she doesn't like. Such as my dog does whine when she wants attention, which is a lot. It's due to her breed honestly. Every dog I know of the same breed does the same thing. Or my dog will dart in front of you and throw herself on her back wanting belly rubs and 9/10 she trips you. Or she will weasel her way between us, digging you in the process because she wants to be touched 24/7 so there's not exactly any alone time or even a moment when you aren't being touched or whined at. So being in a camper with limited space, my fianc\u00e9 has been getting extremely pissed and very touched out when it comes to the dog in general. Before we were in a big house so it was manageable but obviously not now.\n\nWe have been searching for places to go because obviously this camper living life isn't permanent by any means but our state only has a .9 vacancy rate right now due to asylum seekers and refugees so it's been tough. We finally did get a call back on a place a few days ago that was within budget and surprisingly big enough. She told me to jump on it and I had planned to, until they told me I couldn't bring my dog (no pets). So, I turned it down. My fianc\u00e9 went ape shit. She said that I needed to make sacrifices because she is now 7.5 months pregnant and that she would have to get rid of her cats too and she didn't want to do that but the kids are the priority, not the animals. She said the state could come take her kids if she gives birth and tries raising a baby in a tiny camper. I told her I wasn't willing to get rid of my dog for a house for anyone and now she won't speak to me. She told me to go to my mother's and she and \"her kids\" would figure it out. AITA?\n\nETA: this wasn't just about my dog. This is also about my fianc\u00e9s cats. She's had these cats for years now (the oldest for 6 years and the two younger ones for 3). Rehoming her cats would be extremely hard on her mentally, as her cats mean everything to her. I understand she would 100% choose the house over the cats but I don't want her to have to make that decision either.\n\nETA: my fianc\u00e9 was told by her employer she could work from home as a customer service rep when she got pregnant, only to later tell her they terminated the position from the company permanently due to budget cuts. She DID have the finances figured out but was blindsided by unforseen events. She's always been dependent and has never once relied on me for anything. This is a huge transition for her and given that she has always had \"her shit handled\", it's extremely hard for her to be this low right now. AND I was NOT trying to place blame on Asylum seekers. My blame is not directed at them for anything. I was going based off the statistics of our state. We live in Maine and we are the only state in the US that offers 2 years of tax free income matching (other states offer 6 months). Our state has better opportunities for asylum seekers and therefore we get most of them. Currently we are fixing to bring in another 80k from Texas, despite the ones we took in 2 months ago currently living on the streets of Portland. You can look all of this up, as it's made headlines. All new developments are being used as temporary housing for asylum seekers. Our theatres, old mills, expo centers, homeless shelters, etc are all filled with asylum seekers. This is NOT their fault. This is a state issue. I didn't mean to come across as me blaming THEM for anything, I was just pointing out the statistics of our state.", "created_utc": 1682429661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yjly9/aita_for_turning_down_a_housing_opportunity/", "score": 823, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A situation that is only going to get tighter when there's a newborn.\n\nI'd be calling back that place, gladly accepting the terms, and finding a place for your dog with  family or friends, or re-homing it.

You finally get offer for housing for all of you and you turn it down because you put your dog at a higher priority than your gf and your future child, not to mention your step kids.

If you wont sacrifice for them now, will you ever?", "YTA. So, *so* much.\n\nI can understand not being willing to give up a pet. I can even understand sacrificing *one's own* housing situation on a pet's behalf. But you did not even *try* to find a way to make this work, or discuss with your FIANC\u00c9 before turning the offer down. Even with only what you told us here, why would you not simply take the offer so your family can have a home, and stay with your dog in the camper temporarily while you look for a better solution? Is there no one in your life who could house your dog until you get back on your feet? Is your fianc\u00e9's mother perhaps willing to take in the dog if you pay for food/supplies and come by to handle care of her every day?\n\nWe don't know, and apparently neither do you, because you decided leaving your family homeless and at risk was preferable to doing a bit of legwork to find a solution for your pet.

Most massive AH.   Take the housing so your fianc\u00e9e and your step kids have housing.  You can then live in your car with your dog until it does, but your newborn will need to be housed.", "YTA. I honestly totally understand that a pet is family and you can't just get rid of it on a whim.\n\nBut... you don't have the money AND it is preventing you from having a home. I get that you love your pet, but it's time to put your family first. Stop being selfish and think about what kind of futur you are offering your family if you keep your pet.", "YTA. Seriously. There are very very few circumstances where rehoming a dog is the right thing to do but being 7 months pregnant, recently evicted, living in a trailer and apart from the kids? This is when you do what you need to do to stabilize your family. \n\nContact the breed rescue group and start the rehoming process.", "YTA  \nAnd even worst with the edit, she's perfectly able to decide if rehoming the cats is a sacrifice she's willing to do or not to ensure her family's well being. She has a risky pregnancy, and you just added more stress, just so you could keep your dog, that you clearly can't afford. I'm hoping you'll get your priorities straight once the baby arrives - that is, if she doesn't kick you to the curb over this.", "Dude, yeah, YTA. Usually I'm all about prioritizing animals, but you're literally turning down basic needs for your family. Also, it sounds like you aren't very good at managing priorities to begin with- I mean, if you guys can't support the family you currently have, why on EARTH are you having another child?", "Yeah, I think YTA. It\u2019s a shitty situation. Nobody wants to get rid of their pets. But she, while being pregnant with your child, gave up her pets and you can\u2019t foster your dog? \n\nIf there were more opportunities in the area and you hadn\u2019t been looking long or if the current situation wasn\u2019t so bad, maybe NTA. But under these circumstances sometimes you gotta sacrifice.\n\nThough, I will say as a pet owner I understand why you decided what you did. I\u2019m not saying it should have been an easy choice just that there is one less shitty option and you didn\u2019t take it, imo.", "YTA. Normally I'd view the dog as a committment you need to stick with - but in this case there are 2 kids with 1 more on the way to think about. You need to get back on your feet. If you upgrade to a place you all can live, is there someone who could take your dog for the duration of the lease? Maybe by the time the lease is expired a better opportunity would arise?", "Huge Yta.\n\nBased on the post and your comments:\n- your fianc\u00e9 was the breadwinner, was told she would definitely have a work from home position for her pregnancy, and then her employer took that. That all majorly sucks, it truly does.\n\n- She has been nonstop trying to find another job, including ones that are not work from home and potentially putting herself and the baby at risk to provide for her family because you\u2019re all homeless and she\u2019s basically living separately from her other children. \n\n- there\u2019s a huge housing crisis and you\u2019re getting closer to having an infant living in a camper that two of you barely fit in\n\n- you finally get the opportunity to live somewhere in your budget and you turn it down because of a dog\n\nI get not wanting to rehome a pet. I love my dog and my cats immensely. They all get Easter baskets, Christmas stockings, and trick or treat bags along with my human babies. But you are literally homeless. You aren\u2019t doing that dog any favors by keeping her when you cannot take care of her properly by even having a real roof over her head. You don\u2019t even need to permanently rehome her, you could do it temporarily until your fianc\u00e9 is back on her feet and you guys can find a place to live once your lease is up. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is making all of the sacrifices right now and is asking that you make one because you have 2 kids and a third almost here, and you can\u2019t? And don\u2019t act like you\u2019re considering her cats too, you aren\u2019t. This is solely about you and your dog. You literally chose your dog over you and your kids having a place to live. You are 28 years old, you\u2019re already a stepfather and you\u2019re about to be a father to an infant. You need to put the kids before what you want. That is what being a parent is. It isn\u2019t always fun, it isn\u2019t always easy, but it\u2019s the choice you make when you decide to have a child.", "Honestly, if you are struggling to get by you should probably rehome your pet. As sad as it sounds you have children that need a home too. But hopefully you can find a place that does allow pets.", "YTA.\n\nReally? You've already said the dog can be a little rambunctious and potentially a danger to your PREGNANT fianc\u00e9 by tripping her or jumping on her back. If you were living in a bigger house I wouldn't have even commented, but dude, you turned down an incredible housing offer to benefit your future family over a dog. I love my dogs, but wow.", "YTA. She rehomed everything she loves. Her kids, her cats.

You are squatting with a pregnant partner (with potentially dangerous complications) after already having re-homing your children.", "YTA, Jesus Christ this is sad.", "YTA.   \nYour dog is important, but your children and baby and wife will need to come first.   \nCan no one else take your dog in the interim for a few months or a year?", "Yta she has someone watching her cats, you need to find someone to foster your dog.", "YTA. Honestly I was with you until you said she was pregnant. \n\nTemporarily re-home the dog until you guys get back on your feet. Your wife fostered out her animals, and is almost about to give birth, and you can\u2019t sacrifice the dog for a bit? It doesn\u2019t have to be permanent.

So basically, my fianc\u00e9 and I became homeless 3 months ago (went to court and were kicked out due to falling behind on rent- totally justified but still sucked). We had fallen behind on rent because my fianc\u00e9 became pregnant and was put on partial bed rest due to placenta issues so she could no longer work (she worked at a warehouse). She had been searching for at home positions for two months leading up to the eviction but got essentially no where. I don't bring in enough to cover rent and due to the fact that we have two sons already (my step kids) I was **really** falling behind on payments. \n\nCurrently my fianc\u00e9 and I are staying in a camper on her mother's property and the kids usually stay inside with grandma because they want to. My fianc\u00e9 ended up having someone foster her cats, whereas I brought my dog with me. I will admit that she's not a fan of my dog due to some behaviors that she doesn't like. Such as my dog does whine when she wants attention, which is a lot. It's due to her breed honestly. Every dog I know of the same breed does the same thing. Or my dog will dart in front of you and throw herself on her back wanting belly rubs and 9/10 she trips you. Or she will weasel her way between us, digging you in the process because she wants to be touched 24/7 so there's not exactly any alone time or even a moment when you aren't being touched or whined at. So being in a camper with limited space, my fianc\u00e9 has been getting extremely pissed and very touched out when it comes to the dog in general. Before we were in a big house so it was manageable but obviously not now.\n\nWe have been searching for places to go because obviously this camper living life isn't permanent by any means but our state only has a .9 vacancy rate right now due to asylum seekers and refugees so it's been tough. We finally did get a call back on a place a few days ago that was within budget and surprisingly big enough. She told me to jump on it and I had planned to, until they told me I couldn't bring my dog (no pets). So, I turned it down. My fianc\u00e9 went ape shit. She said that I needed to make sacrifices because she is now 7.5 months pregnant and that she would have to get rid of her cats too and she didn't want to do that but the kids are the priority, not the animals. I told her I wasn't willing to get rid of my dog for a house for anyone and now she won't speak to me. She told me to go to my mother's and she and \"her kids\" would figure it out.

Humans are also capable of harming other humans in much, much worse ways than animals. So it goes both ways. For example procreation is very enjoyable for humans, it also leads to unwanted pregnancies and people\u2019s lives being ruined by babies they never wanted. If we look at it from a benefits vs detriments angle, then instead of valuing  other humans, it would be better to use and abuse other humans rather than valuing them as thats the best way to get the most out of other humans. If the main reason we should value another lifeform is simply to obtain a benefit for ourselves, the most bang for your buck would be to gain power and control other humans to do whatever you wished.\n\n2.

Frankly im aghast that instead of us rising up as society about the housing price gouging we turn on eachother for not working 80 weeks for both people to afford a home.  It is insane what is happening!  Houses are 3x4 times what they were and salaries barely budge.  I think people buying homes woth current prices or renting are screwed!!", "And surely they can't afford their pets if they couldn't afford rent? I would prioritise my cats above anything but I don't have a baby on the way or young children to think about, and sometimes prioritising your pets means finding them new, more suitable homes and prioritising their wellbeing over your feelings.", "I have a crazy cat that's always acting as though he's on catnip and he 100% likes to ambush you for no reason at all.

Psycho.", "As soon as I read about the asylum seekers I figured you were in Maine. I am familiar with Maine and I work in homeless services - the lack of housing is not the asylum seekers, just FYI. It's a complex issue but it's absolutely not due to asylum seekers. Also if you have children and she is pregnant I would recommend reaching out to a CAP agency in your area. There are some funds available to help with housing, so when you were behind on rent you could have potentially found rental assistance to avoid homelessness.

I know what I am talking about. I was a foster parent until a year ago. \n\nWhen she squishes out that baby they are going to ask you some very specific questions about where that kid is going and how it\u2019s getting there and unless you outright lie they will FOR SURE inform DFS. \n\nYou think rehoming a cat is hard?

Usually, the consensus is \u201cYOU ARE A MONSTER IF YOU RE-HOME YOUR PETS!!!\u201d No matter what the reason. \n\nBut you guys have been very supportive in the fact that the KID matters most in this.\n\nOp YTA.

That would be psychotic, ik very well that they aren't to blame for the state of things, of course not!\n\nTo answer your question, no, I wasn't implying that at all. I also at no point said that I think they need to own a home first, so not sure where that came from..? \n\nMy point was this and only this, you should be adequately prepared to provide for a child before you have one (*assuming* that you live somewhere where your choice is legally protected, & you had access to contraception & such). In my opinion, these 2 were not. Granted, I may have a different perception of what \"adequately prepared\" means than you or the next person.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the decision has already been made in this case anyway.
