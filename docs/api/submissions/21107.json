We are in an amazing relationship, but this one thing is bugging me and I would like the internet\u2019s opinion on it. \n\n\nOver six months ago, I was going through clothes that I didn\u2019t wear/didn\u2019t fit anymore. I came across a pair of jeans that had huge holes in them from when that was the style lol. I mentioned to fiance that I was gonna use excess fabric to put patches in them and make them look cool. He got super excited, and offered to do it for me. He likes doing little projects like that, so I left them for him. \n\nAfter about two ish months of asking maybe twice, he still hadn\u2019t done them so I attempted it myself. They didn\u2019t last very long and didn\u2019t look great so I told him again that he could do it, and he promised he would and even showed me the fabric he would use. \n\nI really want to clarify that he WANTED to do it, and was sad when I did it myself. \n\nWell, fast forward to my birthday. I get woken up in bed and my present is the jeans that he finally patched. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re very nice and he did a great job, but it was all he got me. These are pants he asked to fix for me months ago and then he claims it\u2019s a present for my birthday. \n\nI told him that I didn\u2019t think it was fair that this was my present, as it was something that he was going to do for me anyways. This lead to both of us fighting and crying because I felt like shit and so did he. \n\nObviously everything is fine with us now and we look back and laugh, but AITA for telling my boyfriend his gift was not great?\n\nEdit: hi! I thought I\u2019d make some clarifications! This was in no way about money spent. There are many holidays and anniversaries that no money is spent at all, and instead gifts are made (songs, paintings, picnics, etc). Also, the pants are very well done and he knows that. After all was said and done in the fight he got many compliments from me, friends, and family, about how amazing the pants are.", "created_utc": 1688261802, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14obo4f/aita_for_telling_my_23f_that_his_25m_bday_gift_to/", "score": 725, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He probably should have gotten you a separate/different present, but you were also kind of a dick in not realizing how much time/effort actually goes into doing that kind of work and realizing that it was a significant time investment for him and that that alone makes it a good/meaningful present.", "[deleted]", "YTA. He was excited to do this for you and thought you'd be happy.  In turn, you took a steaming piss in his Cheerios.  Does he really need to run out and buy you things for you to feel satisfied?", "YTA. You're a little old to be getting bent out of shape about a birthday gift", "YTA.  You didn\u2019t think it was fair?   Fair?  That\u2019s very entitled and ungrateful to make someone cry over a gift he put time and effort into.  Next time tell him the amount of money he has to spend on you for you not to throw a tantrum.", "INFO: What is his gift?\n\nNtA for putting the same effort into gifts as he does, but YTA for being petty and reigniting old fights. You said he felt bad about it and telling him his gift is purposefully shitty is just going to make things worse between y'all.", "Ehs. I can understand the frustration of reviving smth he said he would do six months ago. But I also know work like that takes time, so he was probably sad when he realized you didn\u2019t like it/didn\u2019t seem to appreciate it.", "YTA. I do shibori mending and am currently working on a pair of old ripped jeans for my husband and it has taken me multiple days of effort and a lot of thought and I\u2019m still only 1/3 way through them. I get that he said that he would do it for you, so you expected something else from him for your birthday, but he still put in the time and thought to patch them up. I\u2019m not sure why you think he is obliged to do something like that and not have it count as a special gift. Time is money and I\u2019m personally more impressed by someone hand making me something that buying me something as a gift. It seems as if you two need to communicate better. I think that was a lovely birthday present.", "YTA As soon as you said that he was excited to repurpose a pair jeans for you; it\u2019s very clear that he had the idea to make it a gift for you\u2026 and as you attempted to do the same thing and saw how much of a task it was (as you couldn\u2019t get the desired result), the very least you could do is be appreciative. He spent god knows how long thinking about those jeans.", "ESH. Yeah he was already doing it for you and yes he could\u2019ve gotten you something else as well, but also he had it done for your bday and it is reasonable that he thought it was a good gift and you calling him out is kind if a dick move", "NTA. \n\u2022jeans she owned previously \n\u2022jeans she had to fix once prior because he said he would\n\u2022jeans that HE SAID HE WOULD DO MONTHS PRIOR are given as a gift. \nI do not see how she is the asshole in any, way, shape, or form. He did a project he already said he was doing. That was not time and effort for a gift that was time and effort for a previous project", "He was going to do it whether it was her birthday or not he just decided to do it for her birthday to not have to spend money or actual thought on her.", "but he said he\u2019d do it months ago\u2026 she asked, he hadnt sone anything. so his idea is let\u2019s give you something for your birthday that you already own but now is a bit different. but don\u2019t worry, i spent TIME on it. too much time.", "He was supposed to do it MONTHS ago it was not supposed to be a birthday gift. He did cop out he didn\u2019t want to buy her anything or put any thought into her or her birthday that\u2019s the only thing he \u201cgot\u201d her as a present that\u2019s so disrespectful.", "He could have easily done other shit for her if he didn\u2019t want to spend money. Breakfast in bed, movie marathon of her favorite movies, make her dinner, make her anything that\u2019s not something he was supposed to do months ago. Telling someone you wanna do something for them just to tell them months later that\u2019s their birthday present is beyond lazy and uncaring.", "He literally slapped the label present on something he offered to do months ago that\u2019s not a gift that\u2019s an after thought.", "What do you mean but what is his gift? Like what have h gotten him in the past? \n\nI\u2019m also not holding a grudge, at all. I was just curious to see what the internet thought.", "What\u2019s there to really appreciate he did something he was already supposed to do and have done that\u2019s not a present it\u2019s exactly what she called it a cop out. He begged her to do it too so it\u2019s not like it was some favor she asked him to do. He was being lazy and thoughtless like it was a last minute shit I didn\u2019t get her anything so I\u2019ll do these pants and hope that\u2019s good enough.", "He deserved to be called out who puts that little thought and care into their partner for their birthday? If my partner did that to me I\u2019d be heartbroken like you couldn\u2019t do anything else too nothing crazy but something that shows he actually cares instead of doing what he said he\u2019d do for months just to throw in that he did it as a birthday present. That\u2019s actually really lazy and thoughtless he kept putting it off even tho he knew she wanted them done she even took over and tried herself and then when that failed she relented and said he could have the project back then continued to put it off and used it as an excuse to not do anything else for her birthday.", "[deleted]", "You just told him that he failed. In his mind his work didn't mean anything. He wanted to give you something that you couldn't give yourself. He was prolly thinking that this is special and I'll give it to her on her birthday. That comment \" you were going to do it anyways\" that kind of discounts the work he put into making those jeans something that you would love. That kinda hurts.\n\nWould the gift of the jeans be just as bad if you had thrown away the jeans after you patched them and he dug them out of the trash and didn't tell you he was going to remake them?", "Your question is if you are the asshole for telling your fiance his gift is a cop-out, so I asked what was his gift. Admittedly I read this wrong. I thought by his gift you meant a gift you got him and not a gift he gave you. Like you were going to buy him a gift and tell him the gift you bought him was a cop-out.\n\nNow that I fully understand what's going on, I'm going with ESH. I do think he should have gotten you something else and not something that he would have done whether it was your birthday or not, but you should have talked about it and discussed how it made you feel. No need to blow up.", "It seems like he wanted to use that as a gift back when she first mentioned it?", "What you actually mean is that you don\u2019t like being wrong and won\u2019t see reason so that says a lot about you", "I\u2019m thinking Chipmunk might be OP in disguise or a friend jumping in to downvote every \u201cYTA\u201d ruling here; the impassioned defense leaping into almost every YTA comment is just too uncanny\u2026", "As soon as he saw her doing it herself he should have immediately knew that it was a bad idea because clearly she was done waiting and wanted them done sooner than later. He took what he wanted as more important that what she wanted. All around he seems selfish.", "[deleted]", "That is OPs real account of course, nice catch.", "Oh yeah he messed it up for sure. And he had more than enough time to come up with something else anyway.", "Yeah now the entire thread where people have said YTA is downvoted and all these other accounts are going \u201cNTA\u201d \u2014 report this thread", "Yeah, OP is using a bot. I am going to report the thread, block all of Ops shills and delete.  This is too odd."]}
