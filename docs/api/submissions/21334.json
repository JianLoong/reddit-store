It\u2019s completely understandable that you want to, and she sounds awful, but your very valid feelings don\u2019t outweigh the whole situation.

I always try to step back and look at the situation as if the person was a friend.  Would I let them treat me this way?  Would I remain friends with them if they did?  If the answer is no, then you need to set boundaries.  Being family doesn\u2019t mean you have to be treated like a doormat.  She\u2019s going to have to learn that she can\u2019t treat people poorly now, because once the baby is born, surely she will use the child as an excuse to continue her petulance.  Don\u2019t do her any more favors and don\u2019t throw her a baby shower.  Let her figure it out on her own.  NTA.", "NTA, but you're not being the best advocate for yourself.  You're not \"cancelling\" the shower, and you don't have to tell your sister to DIY.  You can let her know your health and other responsibilities don't allow you to do the heavy lifting for the shower, and ask her which of her friends will be in charge.  Drop everything off, offer to meet with that person once, then try to maintain some emotional distance however your sister may react.\n\nBest of luck to you. <3", "NTA. I would let her figure out life herself while sitting back and watching .", "She expects others to subsidize her living situation just because she's pregnant? Where is the father? Does she work? I mean that's absolutely insane. I would tell her beggars can't be choosers. You can give her the decorations you already got unless you can return them and tell her to do the party herself. You can not keep overextending yourself for someone so ungrateful.\nNTA", "Personally... I'd probably give her the decorations (just consider them yet another gift) and yep, tell her do it yourself or find someone who will put up with your behavior. NTA", "NTA. Is there a history of coddling your sister? Complaining about a roof over your head after being evicted with a baby on the way is worrisome. She needs a reality check and that means she needs you all to let go of her hand. You don't have to abandon her, but she needs to walk on her own two feet because she has a child depending on her now.\n\nYou won't be able to live your own life full time if you keep helping her live hers part-time. I would do the shower and be done with her since I already bought the decoration though.", "The rental I've found her is down the street from my work which is great so I can help out as I live rurally. But won't lie I'm terrified of her being a mum, she had this attitude before pregnancy.", "That's fair lol", "Are you trying for NAH?", "Sounds like the sister was an entitled brat even before becoming pregnant.", "I have no idea what NSH means but yeah fair!", "... No, it isn't. I have never heard that,  and baby showers are often done by mothers, aunts and sisters.", "I'm not sure where you get this. I have had wedding and baby showers and have attended them for 30+ years and they were all held by family members, though friends certainly helped out. The only ones held by non-family members were separate ones managed by coworkers. I just attended a baby shower of a coworker and it was planned and held by her sister and mother-in-law. Maybe that's the rule where you are, but here in Texas it's not. \n\nNote: see comment below by SwimmingCritical.", "I'm so glad to see that someone else knows this. So many showers are given by family members these days - sometimes by the mother-to-be herself - that I thought perhaps I was the only one who was taught this. Showers are supposed to be given by friends, not family members.\n\nEdit to add: sadly, it's a YTA situation if you cancel the party. Get through it and start thinking about how you'll respond to requests for babysitting.", "I don't think it's a separate situation that I'm using to justify it? I'm tired of her abuse. I've just found her a cheap rental for her, her partner and her 5 animals that's close to my work so I can help out, but it's still not good enough. Her attitude was the same as it is now before she was pregnant. But thanks for the input.", "Dont help her. Let her figure out things. She\u2019s going to blame you for everything that goes wrong.", "YES!! Brain fart. Thank you!", "I want to say Nobody Sucks Here!", "Yes it is. Same applies to baby and bridal showers.", "I\u2019m not following how that scenario constitutes \u201cabuse,\u201d but I still feel like you\u2019re in the wrong here.", "Ah good one :) cheers for the input regardless.", "Okay.  I guess more than half of my friends and acquaintances are just incredibly gauche. I have been to literally 30+ bridal and baby showers run by female relatives.  This is the first time I've ever heard anyone say that family shouldn't run showers.  If this is a thing,  it's not a well-known thing in the US, which would then render it not a thing.\n\nETA: I did some digging.  Emily Post Institute says it's not a thing anymore: https://emilypost.com/advice/baby-showers-who-hosts", "I've stated in the original post that she's been incredibly abusive to my family and I. Screaming and swearing at me during conversations. Screaming at our grandmother to give her, her life savings so she can buy a house. Writing Facebook statuses about how shit we are. Screaming at her partner who's expected to financially support the both of them, clean up and cook despite her having no reasons why she can't. \nBut fair enough if you think I'm in the wrong. I'm happy to throw a party, I actually love doing it. I have a lot going on in my life which does make me exhausted at times but this was something that was a distraction. I just don't feel like continuing with it when I get hate thrown in my face.", "None of the information you just provided is indicated in your post above. \n\nJust throw the damn party and be done with it.\n\nEdit: You mentioned the screaming and swearing, but only in the context of the housing issue.", "Nta", "NTA. Please set boundaries and do not enable her behavior by spending your money and putting in all that time and effort planning a party for her!", "NTA. In fact, consider going NC or LC. She sounds like a nightmare \ud83d\ude33", "NTA.\n\nGeez, if you're homeless, you take what's offered. You don't turn up your nose because it's \"not good enough.\" I wouldn't waste any more energy on her.", "I honestly don't believe any of this.", "Nta", "wnbta, for your own sake, stop offering to do her favours", "Wow. She exemplifies \"entitled.\" Only way to fix that is to stop giving/helping/enabling.\n\nEdited to add: if nothing is good enough, nothing it is!", "You\u2019ve already put in a lot of the work and you promised her you would do it. IMHO, you would be TA is you canceled. Finish what you\u2019ve started but don\u2019t do her any more favors until she gets her shit together.", "Do all of us taxpayers a favor and give her an abortion not a baby shower", "This is my vote as well.\n\nDo the shower since you're pretty much there. Then wash your hands of her. \n\nNTA", "Do not help out physically or financially.  Please let CPS know of your issues about her.  They can open a file before the child is born.  They can make sure the home is a safe place to bring the baby home and it will be cared for.", "You will continue to get hate thrown in your face.  She is an abusive person and abusive people do that type of thing.  You don\u2019t deserve the abuse and honestly, you shouldn\u2019t offer to help her out or you will be raising her child for her.  This is a \u201cgive an inch, take a mile\u201d person so I don\u2019t think you should be on the hook to help her or you won\u2019t have your own life.  \n\nWhat if HER child is allergic to dogs?  Would your sister make you get rid of your puppy?  You know that she would.\n\nThere is only one person you are responsible for and that is yourself.  Your sister and her poor life choices aren\u2019t you responsibility.  Whether you throw the shower or not, go NC with your sister so you don\u2019t have to put up with her being abusive.  Her child is just going to be the tool she uses to con the rest of her family out of their time, sanity, and most of all, money."]}
