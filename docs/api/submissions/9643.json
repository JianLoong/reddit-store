(4 person unit, 2 others besides us). I got back to the apartment and explained that it was mine, and that I didn\u2019t want to throw it away because it would smell over time. The garbage had also just been taken out. Also explained that there were dishes in the sink so I couldn\u2019t put it down the garbage disposal at the time. (Not my dishes) Note that it was a small maybe 2 inch diameter piece. My roommate does not have sensitivities to meat of any kind and cooks meats of various types, including chicken, regularly. Also note that the chicken had been in the sink for about 24-48 hours and that\u2019s how long it took for the dishes to be cleared. I told her that when the dishes were cleared out I would take care of it and run the disposal as well as wash the sink, which is what I normally do. She stated that this didn\u2019t seem like a good idea to her and that we should instead try to bag it and throw it away. (For fear of the sink smelling.) I told her that I had already wrapped up and tied the bag / containers it came in from the store in to save counter space (small kitchen) and I didn\u2019t want to waste another bag or open the ones I tossed because juices would get everywhere and be one more step while cooking. She asked why I couldn\u2019t take it to the garbage chute down the hall and I told her that I didn\u2019t want to leave my actively cooking food for risk of hazards or ruined food. I also again didn\u2019t want to waste any bags. She offered the idea of a small trash receptacle under our sink that we routinely take out but I reminded her of the bag usage I was trying to avoid and mentioned that using that method would result in a lot of bacterial transfer with the cupboard and receptacle itself / space around it. I also mentioned that it would be impractical and inconvenient to have one more step such as that, even with a schedule. In my opinion using the sink and cleaning it is the easiest method. Also note I\u2019m the one who primarily and regularly cleans the sink regardless of chicken disposal I also take apart the components and clean those too. I checked with one of our other roommates and she said she\u2019s not bothered by me tossing my chicken scraps there and she hasn\u2019t noticed / been bothered by a smell.

Last resort: Gotten disposable tupperware/ziploc baggie, put the chicken scraps in it, and put it back in the fridge CLEARLY LABELED \"do not eat\".
