But people don't get CF because their parents are related, it's simply a faulty gene which is more common in people who come from a certain part of the world  (Hello, fellow Scots!) The NHS estimates 1 in 25 in the UK are carriers and when both parents are carriers it can be passed on.

I deadass looked them in the face and said \u201cmy mom died last month. Wanna try that again?\u201d\n\nThat experience was a learning one for me too.

This guy managed to get all of it wrong.", "Do you have other relatives descended from great-grandpa X who have CF?", "Nope, but some are carriers as when I was dx\u2019ed, everyone from both sides of the family freaked out and did the DNA tests. Both parents are carriers so it was pretty much a Russian roulette situation except they didn\u2019t know.\n\nMy kid is a carrier btw (don\u2019t freak out I\u2019m a teen dad) since the baby mama is healthy."]}
