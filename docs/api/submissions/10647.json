I'm not her piggy bank.\u201d\n\nExactly.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much money she spends on a child, if she can afford it and it doesn\u2019t make her cut on other stuff then it\u2019s fine but if she wants to split the money then she should tell you first.", "NTA. $1100 for an 11-year-old boy?? He will be lucky to wear those clothes for one full season. Aside from that, I think you are 100% correct on needing to pay 1/2 since she didn't consult you about it ahead of time.", "She shouldn\u2019t have bought the clothes if she couldn\u2019t afford to pay for them herself, and she definitely shouldn\u2019t have expected you to pay that outrageous half without talking to you first \n\nShe made that very expensive choice and thought she could haggle with you after the fact? Lol. \n\nNTA.", "NTA honestly I wouldn't even give her a dime, if she wants to spend that much money that is her choice. There is no reason to spend that much money on clothes unless the child/person has absolutely 0 clothes and it's a bunch of clothes.", "NTA. You can\u2019t go on a shopping spree at expensive stores and expect halfsies. It doesn\u2019t work that way. I\u2019m guessing you pay her child support as well? That\u2019s what those checks are for, except most moms buy clothing at reasonable stores.", "NTA. Don\u2019t pay for purchases that aren\u2019t discussed. Go buy him some reasonably priced clothes to keep at your house. Your also right that your bonus is NONE of her business.", "NTA\n\nTell her to take you to court for it. Because no judge is going to let a person come in and say I want him to pay half of the cost on clothes that I chose the store to purchase them from, without talking to him first, or agreeing on a budget. I just went and spent what I wanted to spend, and then expected him to reimburse me half the cost.\n\nThe judge would laugh her out the door.\n\nBut a suggestion. Why don't you suggest a agreement that she purchases clothes for him at her house, and you purchase clothes for him at yours. That way you both are responsible for his clothes, at your own places, there is no shared cost, and he never goes without. Let the child pick what he wants to wear. Then you never have this problem again.", "Nta. She didn't consult you, you're not obligated. I honestly doubt would give her anything, especially after the \"aren't you getting a bonus\" comment. It's weird she had plans for your money.", "NTA.  I'm sure she did this on purpose (\"forgiveness not permission\" bullshit) because she knew you weren't going to go along.", "NTA.\n\nI think you're on the hook for half of a ***reasonable*** supply of clothes for the kid, but $1,100 is well beyond the limit of what's reasonable. It should have been discussed beforehand rather than simply assumed, and since she was the only one who knew she was going to do that - the onus for having that discussion is on her. Having failed to have that discussion, she has only herself to blame.", "NTA  she should always discuss a clothing budget before shopping.   I'm also assuming you pay child support which is for such expenses.   Not that you shouldn't contribute to clothing, just that you should get a say in the budget.  That only surprises bills you should pony up for a medical expenses.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nShe didn\u2019t discuss the purchase beforehand or ask if you would be willing to go half prior to spending that amount of money. It was her decision to get expensive clothing for the child without consulting you.", "NTA \n\nIf either of you wants to spend a lot of money for your kid and wants the other parent to go half, you need to discuss this with the other parent first, you\u2019re completely right about that.", "Definitely NTA, I\u2019m a grown ass woman and I\u2019ve never even spent that amount of money on clothes for myself, let alone a child that will grow out of them in a year. If she wanted you to go half on something like that, it should\u2019ve been discussed prior to this", "NTA. \n\nTypically clothing is included in child support. Expenses not directly court ordered are to be mutually agreed upon before incurring the expenses. Otherwise, she made the choice to spend the money, she gets to cover it. \n\nI do think giving your son a budget for clothing at the beginning of the year is a good lesson in how to pick and choose what you save vs splurge on. That\u2019s something you can address with him.", "NTA How about instead of paying half this time, tell her you'll buy his clothes the next time he needs them, like for back-to-school? Then you control the budget. Just make sure you buy stuff he'll like and not get made fun of for wearing. Middle school is brutal!", "NTA.  \n\nIt's a liability to split child expenditures that way.  Hard to stay on a budget that way anyhow.   \n\nBut you don't have to go clothes shopping now, and that's priceless.", "NTA If she wanted you to pitch in, then she should have discussed it with you before she went shopping.  That besides the fact that $1100 is a lot for an 11 year old.", "NTA. If she wanted you to pay half, she should have discussed it with you ahead of time and agreed on a budget. If she decided to splurge, that's on her.", "NTA. My ex tried to pull this with me much earlier on after the divorce when she knew at that point even if I wanted to, I couldn't. If she wants monetary help, she needs to consult BEFORE, not AFTER. I wouldn't have even given the 200 to be honest; that's money you can use for clothes at your place.", "Depends on what your custody agreement states. Does it say you're required to pay the other party for 50% of unapproved purchases? If not, NTA", "NTA and i'm surprised you even gave her anything. She absolutely should have asked if she wanted you to go halfsies on it.", "5 years in on the divorce, and OP still gets texts like this?  \n\nNTA.  without even knowing if support is being paid, outside of the demand for more money.\n\nIf OP already pays support, he's already paid for his portion of her nonsense.", "Nta if she wanted to spend that much then you should have been consulted if she wanted you to pay half", "NTA. \n\nIf she wanted you to go halves on new clothes for him, she should have consulted you first and you both should have agreed on a budget. $1100 on clothes is pretty ridiculous for a kid who could easily have a massive growth spurt and outgrow all of those new clothes by summer.", "NTA. If she had spent a reasonable amount or discussed a budget in advance, I would think otherwise but your offer of contributing $200 is fair.", "NTA she's clearly not responsible with money. It's not your fault, she needs to discuss things with you before and early no young boy needs 1000$ worth of clothes. She can also take them back get a refund if she can't afford it", "NTA", "NTA", "Lol! I always had the deal with both my single mom and re-married dad that if I needed clothing, we could go to the SAAN store (probably like Walmart back in the day). If I wanted anything more than the shoes, jeans and shirts we found there, I would pay the difference.\n\nI didn't even really know there were other stores we could consider until I was a late teenager! NTA - make that deal with your ex, splitting those costs only, unless your child support payments are supposed to go to their clothing needs and in that case, tell her ... something less friendly.", "Info:  Did you know they were going shopping for new clothes?  Did you offer to help at all before the shopping trip?  Did you have plans to get your kid new clothes?\n\nThe lack of communication between you 2 is troubling.", "ESH \nKids only get more expensive as they get older. So get prepared for it. And, yeah, the kid is going to want expensive clothes, electronics, eventually a car. \n\nBut she absolutely should have consulted you. In the future, the two of you need to figure out the clothing budget for the child and split the cost. If the child wants to go over the budget, one parent can ask the other for help, but it shouldn\u2019t be expected.", "NTA.\n\nI like to buy my son some expensive things. I'm the idiot doling out $ for a pair of Vans he wore twice. \n\nI don't ask his dad for any type of reimbursement. He buys him clothes for his house and I buy him ones for mine.", "NTA. If you're going to split costs you need to have an understanding of what each person is willing to pay but regardless, $1100 is ridiculous.\n\nMy ex and I have an agreement that we just buy what we need for our own homes but I have a friend who splits by season: she buys warm weather clothes and he buys cold weather clothes to avoid these types of arguments.", "NTA. What your agreement should be is she buys him clothes and you buy him clothes and you each pay your own. He can decide what to wear, he\u2019s old enough. That\u2019s assuming you don\u2019t clothe him in garage sale and thrift store rags.", "NTA-seems generous to me that you gave her any money as she didn't ask before she bought the clothes.", "ESH - simply because most countries have pretty clear divorce laws / agreements and you didn't talk about what you are legally supposed to do.  If you are not legally obliged to pay for anything then you owe her squat.  Unfortunately she's set you up to be the bad parent here which sucks.", "NTA", "None of the prices you listed are outrageous or surprising for those items. Like, that\u2019s how much stuff costs at Target. $60 for denim that won\u2019t start falling apart after 3 months (especially when worn by a child) is average af. \n\nYTA unless the rest of the $ was actually spent unreasonably. Children need new clothes all the time. Not to mention the importance of giving them some freedom of expression & a chance to think about their own individuality.\n\nETA to add that the bonus comment she made is super out of line so actually ESH plus she probably should\u2019ve brought this up before spending all that.", "Maybe he deserves and the mom is helping him improving is self esteem.", "NTA. The easiest thing to do might be for you to take him shopping for clothes that he wears when he is with you.
