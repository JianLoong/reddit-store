Lol. \n\nNTA.", "NTA honestly I wouldn't even give her a dime, if she wants to spend that much money that is her choice. There is no reason to spend that much money on clothes unless the child/person has absolutely 0 clothes and it's a bunch of clothes.", "NTA. You can\u2019t go on a shopping spree at expensive stores and expect halfsies. It doesn\u2019t work that way. I\u2019m guessing you pay her child support as well? That\u2019s what those checks are for, except most moms buy clothing at reasonable stores.", "NTA. Don\u2019t pay for purchases that aren\u2019t discussed. Go buy him some reasonably priced clothes to keep at your house. Your also right that your bonus is NONE of her business.", "NTA\n\nTell her to take you to court for it. Because no judge is going to let a person come in and say I want him to pay half of the cost on clothes that I chose the store to purchase them from, without talking to him first, or agreeing on a budget. I just went and spent what I wanted to spend, and then expected him to reimburse me half the cost.\n\nThe judge would laugh her out the door.\n\nBut a suggestion. Why don't you suggest a agreement that she purchases clothes for him at her house, and you purchase clothes for him at yours.

I'm also assuming you pay child support which is for such expenses.   Not that you shouldn't contribute to clothing, just that you should get a say in the budget.  That only surprises bills you should pony up for a medical expenses.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nShe didn\u2019t discuss the purchase beforehand or ask if you would be willing to go half prior to spending that amount of money.

Expenses not directly court ordered are to be mutually agreed upon before incurring the expenses.

That\u2019s something you can address with him.", "NTA How about instead of paying half this time, tell her you'll buy his clothes the next time he needs them, like for back-to-school? Then you control the budget. Just make sure you buy stuff he'll like and not get made fun of for wearing. Middle school is brutal!", "NTA.  \n\nIt's a liability to split child expenditures that way.  Hard to stay on a budget that way anyhow.   \n\nBut you don't have to go clothes shopping now, and that's priceless.", "NTA If she wanted you to pitch in, then she should have discussed it with you before she went shopping.

If she decided to splurge, that's on her.", "NTA. My ex tried to pull this with me much earlier on after the divorce when she knew at that point even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

I wouldn't have even given the 200 to be honest; that's money you can use for clothes at your place.", "Depends on what your custody agreement states.

If she had spent a reasonable amount or discussed a budget in advance, I would think otherwise but your offer of contributing $200 is fair.", "NTA she's clearly not responsible with money.

And, yeah, the kid is going to want expensive clothes, electronics, eventually a car. \n\nBut she absolutely should have consulted you. In the future, the two of you need to figure out the clothing budget for the child and split the cost. If the child wants to go over the budget, one parent can ask the other for help, but it shouldn\u2019t be expected.", "NTA.\n\nI like to buy my son some expensive things. I'm the idiot doling out $ for a pair of Vans he wore twice. \n\nI don't ask his dad for any type of reimbursement. He buys him clothes for his house and I buy him ones for mine.", "NTA. If you're going to split costs you need to have an understanding of what each person is willing to pay but regardless, $1100 is ridiculous.\n\nMy ex and I have an agreement that we just buy what we need for our own homes but I have a friend who splits by season: she buys warm weather clothes and he buys cold weather clothes to avoid these types of arguments.", "NTA. What your agreement should be is she buys him clothes and you buy him clothes and you each pay your own. He can decide what to wear, he\u2019s old enough. That\u2019s assuming you don\u2019t clothe him in garage sale and thrift store rags.", "NTA-seems generous to me that you gave her any money as she didn't ask before she bought the clothes.", "ESH - simply because most countries have pretty clear divorce laws / agreements and you didn't talk about what you are legally supposed to do.  If you are not legally obliged to pay for anything then you owe her squat.  Unfortunately she's set you up to be the bad parent here which sucks.", "NTA", "None of the prices you listed are outrageous or surprising for those items.

Briefs are from the discount store, either Walmart or Target.  FOTL is just fine and you'll get way more of them. \n\nJeans, hoodies and t-shirts are all kids that age want.  They can be picked up from everywhere, and for way less.", "I don't think my entire wardrobe, including stuff I haven't worn in 8 years and likely doesn't fit would add up to $1100 if I still had the price tags.....", "NTA . That's a crazy amount for not even that many clothes . Even if she made the argument over fashion and aesthetics , no one is gonna see his boxers or care about his snoopy socks. And you weren't even involved in buying them.  It's her responsibility", "I have two girls, 11 and 13. The only time I've spent over $500 in one hit for clothes for them was last year, buying my 13 year old's brand new high school uniform (year 7 in Australia). Which will then get handed down to her younger sister. I was horrified and my husband and I strategized about it for months before purchasing. \n\nNTA", "I'm a grown ass man and spend less on my clothes", "Damn. I'm 40 and felt bad when I spent $80 on a new dress for a funeral. And it's not like we're poor or anything. I couldn't imagine spending that much on clothes.", "Right? My brother grew over 3 inches between 11 and 12...granted he topped out at 6'7\" so he had lots of growth spurts\ud83d\ude2f", "This. 100%. \n\nWe share custody of my stepson with his mom and stepdad. We buy a lot of clothes and noticed they do buy clothes but not as many. But that\u2019s fine. He has something nice to wear and that is what We think is important. But if we wanted them to go half (or they want to go that with us) they need to ask upfront. That is just the right thing to do. Any bonuses or extra money isn\u2019t even important. \n\nOP giving her 200 is even generous. You don\u2019t have to. But I get why you would (to keep the peace). \n\nAlso 1100 on clothes is outrageous for an 11 year old. To each its own but if you want anyone else to pay as well then you really need to ask first.", "Are we even sure she spent that much on his clothes tho\n\n>Then she says \"aren't you getting a bonus?\" I told her that's none of her business and if I am or am not, that's not hers to spend. \n\nThis makes me think she just wants that bonus and isn't about the clothes at all.", "That\u2019s what my son does with his ex. There are times when clothes end up at the other\u2019s house but most stay where they were bought. It works for them. They also discuss and agree to special things for sports, holidays, etc.", "Apparently, 11 year old boys need to be super keen on fashion and wear those Nike boxers... to impress whom? Mom wanted to play dress up and how she's out the cost.  \n\nOuch.", "NTA.  That phrase is ridiculous in a context like this.  The more complete version is, \"it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.\" From your ex?  Really?  Ok, you wouldn't have gotten permission, but now you aren't getting forgiveness, either.", "Yeah this is such a wrong take. Lmfao \u201ca car\u201d some kids are lucky to have a parent with one working car. A kid isn\u2019t entitled to a car nor expensive electronics if the parents aren\u2019t ok with it.", "Same(ish). My son is 5\u201911\u201d at 12 and we\u2019ve been lucky to get 6 months out of clothes", "Or even big enough to buy the truck. 11 year old needs a 16 wheeler, right?", "I WISH we could do that.  My oldest stepkids are old enough to want to bring their entire wardrobes back and forth every other week... pure madness.", "What does that have to do with it", "We did this for my SD all the way through teenage years. She liked it that way as she didn't have to worry about what to pack, and dragging bags around. She just brought her phone, books she was reading at the time, and anything else she felt like bringing.\n\nWe had a computer, tablet, bike, etc for her at our home. She had double of everything. She loved going shopping with me. We did that regularly to keep her in clothes lol.", "Tell her to go to TJ Maxx next time! Still get brand names for a lot less."]}
