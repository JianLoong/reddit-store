My mom met her fiance three years ago, and my sister (15F) myself and mom moved in with him last year. I'll be honest, I don't like the guy and I have no idea why she is with him. He makes most of the money, but my mom still works full time, I work part time, and the two of us and my sister still do our chores. He does nothing.\n\nHe's a dick to us as well, he's that classic stoic never smiling asshole stepdad who likes the flaunt himself. Sometimes I'll get permission from my mom to go sleep at a friends place, and last minute he'll tell me no with no reason besides \"because it's my house\". But the worst part is how he treats my sister. He constantly tells her not to \"show herself off\" and says she likes to dress like a hooker (she doesn't). One time he got mad at her for wearing jeans, since they'd \"give they boys a show\" and made her change into a skirt, which she hates.\n\nSo the other week I was pretty surprised when he sat me down and asked me for my blessing to marry my mom, but I said no. I told him I don't think he treats any of us with respect, I think he's a raging misogynist who barely keeps his true views to himself, and he's a lazy. I told him if he vanished off the face of I'd feel bad for mom, but not him, so if it were up to me I'd rather he screw off.\n\nHe mumbled something about \"my roof, don't tell me what to do\" and walked off. My sister said he asked her later, and it went pretty much the same way, down to what he said after he said no. He's still marrying our mom, but now things are weird since it's out that we hate the guy. Mom had a talk with us about how she loves him, ane could we at least accept that.

As hard as it might be for her, the things he says to your sister are absolutely unacceptable. Telling her she dresses like a hooker for jeans and demanding she wear a skirt is weird and almost creepy to me. Fiance is definitely an AH and your mom needs to realize it", "NTA \n\nI am trying to digest this line... \n\n\"One time he got mad at her for wearing jeans, since they'd \"give they boys a show\" and made her change into a skirt, which she hates.\"\n\n\nYour step dad is a massive creep.\nCurious what your mom's response to this was? Does she see this as a red flag?", "NTA\n\nYour mother may love him and want to marry him.\n\nYou are getting an unwanted housemate not of your choosing.\n\nTell your mother you will be a polite housemate, ***if he will do the same.***  But it needs to be clear that he is not a parent, not your father, and you will not accept him as an authority.  And if he acts as anything less than a polite housemate to any of you, then both  you and your sister will call him out on it.\n\n\"Polite housemates\" means equitable sharing of chores, polite speech, avoiding raised voices and rude under-the-breath asides, etc. (I doubt he'll live up to this or accept it.)\n\nYou might also, quietly, put out feelers among any extended family you may have about who you can turn to if the living situation does not work for you.  You want a safe, planned exit route, if necessary.\n\nETA:  I would also suggest that you collect your birth certificate, social security cards, and any other vital documentation, and store it in a secure place. (Do they rent safe deposit boxes at banks to minors?)  If things go badly, you don't want him controlling these documents.", "NTA, and honestly I've got some respect for you for being upfront honest with the guy about how you feel about him. I don't know if I'd have the courage to do that.\n\nJust be aware, you're in for an awkward few years ahead, at least until you can move out and get out from under the guy's thumb.", "NTA. He sounds abusive. Reach out to other adults around you for help. Your mom sounds delusional.", "The amount of good mothers who would marry a man while her children explicitly state they do not like him is zero.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour mom\u2018s fianc\u00e9 is a massive, inconsiderate and insensitive AH. He doesn\u2019t deserve your blessing and when your mother chooses to marry him, she only brings more trouble into the family. That\u2018s on her and her future husband though, certainly not on you!", "NTA. His asking for your blessing to marry his mom was performative. He is not a nice man but part of the problem is your mother allowing him to speak to you and your sister in the manner he does. As for your mother still working full-time and you and your sister doing  chores, that is a good thing. If one day your mother decides to leave him she has a job and you all have the means and ability to take care of yourselves.", "NTA but please be careful. Until you turn 18 he has power and you have little. Even then you may need to bite your tongue in order to be there for your mother and sister. My advice is to keep your mouth shut and your eyes open. Be as prepared as you can to get help for yourself and others. That means keep an eye out for abuse and try to get evidence. That means saving money, organising documentation and having a place to go at low or no notice. That means making sure you have a way to contact your sister (and she you) especially if you have left home. I hope you never need this advice, but better to be prepared", "NTA. Why would he ask you at all if he's going to do it anyway?", "NTA.  With someone that controlling, I'm worried for your mother, especially if he won't have your sister to bully anymore.", "NTA. You told him the truth. It's not your fault that he wanted honeyed words and not what he got.\n\nYour mother is also an AH here. It's her job to protect both you and your sister. Instead, she is making you live with a misogynist and general red flag collector. She needs to accept that her children are already counting down the days before they're old enough to get away from her fianc\u00e9. If she can't see that, I'd wager she will not be seeing much of either you or your sister in the not too distant future.", "NTA\n\nWhy did this raging misogynist even bother to ask you? A game?", "NTA\n\nYour mom should accept that she has two children are more important than him.", "NTA, but your mom and the fiancee are. Asking and not actually respecting what you are told is... disrespectful to say the least. And mom can love him all she wants, she should wait marrying the guy untill you two move out.", "NTA.\n\nYou are allowed your feelings and he literally asked for it. \n\nHonestly, I think it's weird either of them are moving forward with the proposal and engagement after you and your sister both didn't give your blessing. To me, it's like a neon sign saying he doesn't care about how you feel.\n\nOn the other side of it, he and your mom are both consenting adults and if this is what they want you have to respect it. So as long as you aren't actively trying to break them up, my vote won't change.", "> Mom had a talk with us about how she loves him, ane could we at least accept that.\n\nwell you guys do because you said \n\n> I told him if he vanished off the face of I'd feel bad for mom, but not him\n\nLook. People can't just behave badly, in a disrespectful, dishonourable manner, and expect to be liked or loved (as opposed to barely tolerated) because someone else likes/loves them. \n\nThis is not how relationships between people work. If your step dad and your mother are lacking the emotional intelligence to realize, it does not mean that the onus to change behaviour is on you and your sister.\n\nNTA. If he wants to be accepted as a step dad, and not just accepted as \"my mom's boyfriend, but I don't like him\", he has to make an effort, instead of hiding behind \"you live under my roof\". As if you had a choice in your living situation anyway. You're a teenager. Your residence is wherever your mother chooses. You didn't choose any of this.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your stuck in a home with him. He sounds like garbage. Maybe sit down with your mom and sister and lay everything out, exactly why you dislike him, what he has done to cause you to not like him, and what you expect once they marry (bc you\u2019ll still be stuck with him until you move out so it\u2019s better to tell them you expect better respect and responses when you and your sister talk to him. That you expect him to actually do shit around the house etc.) and I would tell your mom that you plan on never having a relationship with him ever, so she should not expect anything different. Tell her you glad she\u2019s happy, buts she\u2019s happy at the detriment to you and your sister\u2026", "NTA \n\nHe tried to force approval out of you. That's not how these things work.", "NTA. she needs to RUN! your poor sister. she\u2019s just a girl already being objectified and sexualized by a grown ass man! your mother should not be prioritizing this man over her children.", "NTA. Do you have any other family you can talk to and be honest about what's happening? Maybe you and your sister can live with your dad's extended family? \n\nYour mom's boyfriend sounds like a stepdad from hell and your mom is doing a terrible job protecting you and your sister from him.", "NTA \nHe sounds like a creep. Hopefully, when you turn 18, you and your sister get the hell out of dodge. Tell a trusted adult about him making you and your sister uncomfortable. Let your sister know that she can tell you if he tries something because I doubt your mom will believe her and do anything about it. Also, try and tell your mom he's not your parent, and he can not veto her saying if you can or can not do something . Stay safe", "NTA Its awful that your mom wants to marry someone who treats her kids badly", "NTA. Sorry you\u2019re in this situation buddy", "The dude is delusional - the only reason I can think of is that he wanted some extra validation or a nice moment - but why would he think he\u2019d get it from you two? \n\nNTA he asked you answered. Brace yourself till you move out.", "NTA.  You said the truth.  Maybe he should think about how he treats people.", "NTA, and I don't have much more to say to this because you have a strikingly accurate opinion of him already. Just that your mom is being incredibly foolish and unfair to both of you by marrying him despite knowing the specifics of how you both feel and why you feel that way. She's willingly choosing to ignore her partner's atrotious treatment of *her* children, which is the absolute height of selfish behaviour. People will tell you to forgive her and give her a free pass for being in love, but when she is a provider for the family there is no room for free passes. She failed you and your sister, and is continuing to do so every day. And if you can look past that one day, more power to you; but don't let anyone else tell you you should.", "NTA.\n\n\"Mom, I get that you love him, but do you get that it's really hard to see you continue to love and want to be with someone who treats us, your children, so poorly? I can accept your decision but that doesn't mean I have to respect it.\"", "NTA\n\nDid you ask your mum why she loves someone who treats her children like crap?", "NTA and it sounds like you and your sister are strong, smart, sensible people who have each other's backs. That's awesome. Just a few more years, you got this.", "Honestly this dude sounds like a basic AH, but your mom is the raging AH here. NTA, I'm sorry you have to deal with the shortcomings of your mom's parenting and her selfishness.", "It depends.  If you withheld your approval in your mom's best interest, I could understand.  If you withheld your approval for your own feelings, you're an AH.  And yes, I know, you can justify that it's all for your mom's best interest, but that's not what your post sounded like.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plus, the guy sounds like a major creep talking to your sister the way he does.  He wouldn't find her clothing inappropriately if he wasn't sexualizing her.  \n\nDo you have any grandparents or relatives you could live with until you're both 18? I get the feeling once your mom marries him, he's going to get worse.  So if you have another safe place to stay it might be worth getting that set up.  If he does get worse, tell a teacher or doctor (an obligated reporter) who can help you and your sister get out of that situation.", "NTA. Of course you can't give your blessing, since you hate the guy. Why does your mother let him treat you like this? Do you have other family you could stay with?

You never ask a question if you are not confident you want the answer. \n\nPeople mess up surprise parties and proposals all the time by not doing it right. \n\nIf your potential spouse wants you to ask their father, mother, children, or imaginary friend for permission or blessing, you do, and you prepare by not being an AH to them. \n\nHe asked but treated this like everything else in his life. He took it for granted and acted as if you should be grateful he would allow you in his home. While that may be true, it doesn't mean you like or respect him. \n\nStepkids are a full-time job. You need to gain their respect, gain their trust, and have them like you to a degree to get along well. It is hard as hell. \n\nRelationships are easier. Your mom may only want a man who is financially stable and treats her decently.  That may be all she wants. That's fine. But that is not stepdad material. \n\nYour mom is an AH for not considering her childrens needs and not setting boundaries for her kids. It is fine is she has few boundaries, but what step dad said to sister, all comments, and forced labor is not cool. She is also an AH for not defending your answer, trying to create a blended family, and demanding respect when you were respectful. She is going to you because her BF is not happy and she vastly underestimated how he made you feel. \n\nYour moms BF is an AH for making zero attempt at being a stepdad, being shitty in general, and how he reacted to the answer to his own question. \n\nYou are not an AH for answering his question honestly or having these feelings.

Both of you, either together or separately. Together has the advantage of mutual support and the ability to back each other up, and will be easier.
