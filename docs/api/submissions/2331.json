It sounds like they all need to grow up a lot, and your husband needs to set some serious financial boundaries with his family.\n\nAs someone who also dislikes confrontation I understand that it's super hard to speak up to people who have become used to a certain behavior. It's not easy to bear the shitstorm that follows the initial change, and it sometimes never goes away. \n\nMy two cents is to break down what your husband is actually paying for, decide which things are frivolous and which are actually important expenses for his family (be brutally honest about those things), and then let his family know those unnecessary things are going away ASAP. The important ones he can either choose to still pay for, or he can put together a plan with his family to pay for themselves eventually.

She was clearly trying to get a hand out from you.  Perhaps you need to stop helping them at all and talk to your husband about it.  He isn't helping, he's enabling.

Of course we\u2019ll cover her at the bars even though she says it\u2019s fine, and obviously we\u2019re going to buy her a ticket home.\n\nOh, she\u2019s working a bunch of hours because she volunteered to help children in underserved communities? How noble. We don\u2019t mind doing a couple extra chores when she\u2019s too exhausted to get to them.\n\nOh, she paid for a bunch of stuff for her (jerkwad) boyfriend and now can\u2019t afford to come out ever. I guess she\u2019s a really great girlfriend at least. I guess I didn\u2019t need the whole six pack if she wants to pregame with us.\n\nOh, she quit her high paying job with health insurance to work with disabled children. That\u2019s\u2026swell. What\u2019s that, she also has a bunch of medical expenses she knew were coming up, but forgot she might need health insurance for? Well, I guess it\u2019s a good thing her parents have some extra funds\u2026\n\nWhile I genuinely don\u2019t think she was ever purposely manipulative, she\u2019d constantly get caught up in the feel good rush/avoiding guilt that came with helping others to her own determent, and never considered how it hurt her friends and loved ones to see her struggle from giving too much, or how much of her ability to be giving came from having a safety net of people willing to help her stay comfortable after.", "That\u2019s just rich-people speak. I would never vacation with a nanny, because vacations, especially over holidays, are for family time. Different worlds.", "Yea I think you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t get over them all being able to fly first class. I think I would kill for that experience just once lol!", "Reminds me of this story I was told when I was a child.\n\nThere was a nice man traveling in the woods. On his way, he met creatures who asked for his help.\n\nEach time he helped, they took a part of something from him, like his arm, leg etc.\n\nAs time passed, he was left with his head. He was down to one eye. Slowly, he realized that he helped to the point where he was left with almost nothing. He cried as he was left to fend for himself.\n\nBasically, the morale of the story was that you help only when you can. It's important to help others, but be aware of what you can give. Not everyone will help you. At the end of the day, you need to help yourself first because no one will do that for you.\n\nPretty dark childhood story right? I have the picture book and everything.\n\nAnyway, my point is that I know what you mean, coming from a wife who also has a generous husband.\n\nI told my husband this story and I'm not saying it changed him, but it helped him to be aware of what was going on. I also told him how I was afraid that he could lose himself and leave me, and I think he was more afraid of leaving me.\n\nMaybe you could share that story with him and then add on to share your concerns?\n\nMy husband was also giving with his family. And you know what, it was never enough for them. It later led to their greed and my husband finally saw through it. Now, we're NC and I'm pretty sure his family blames me, but hey, I'm just glad to get him out of that guilt-tripping, manipulated life. \n\nIt's not going to be easy, but you really need to open his eyes before it sours your marriage. Of course, please take care of yourself.", "Can you phrase it along the lines of how to deal with things as parents and a couple going forward versus individual therapy for his relationship with his parents? Couples or family counseling?\nA way to set boundaries so you don't have a situation like the airport again?\nSet more general boundaries versus just against his family for making sacrifices?\nMaybe put in context of concerns for your kids ?...like would he like to see them struggling in debt to give his family money or something more subtle but how his behavior can possibly hurt the kids but within the context of your relationship dynamics and what you want for your family together. Kid wants to be like dad so they give all their meals away to someone at school or camp and then end up in the hospital because they haven't eaten in a week because they can't see that it is important that they eat too. \n\nThey will learn by his example and he may not see what this will do to their own behavior seeing him do this. \n\nI mean he would have chosen to put his sister in comfort versus see to his kids' needs. \nHe doesn't see how him setting himself on fire hurts anyone other than himself right now versus him potentially allowing that behavior to hurt you and the kids because you guys come second to his familial sacrifices. \nI understand you can't force him to see how the behavior is hurting himself but maybe showing how it can affect your family together it will sink in more?\n\nAlso would he want his kids to act the way his family does? \n\nJust find a way to make it more about the dynamics within your family together and then use those boundaries and goals to segue into seeing aspects of the bad boundaries with the in-laws. I don't know how possible that is but it is the only thing I could think of of he denies any other reason to go to therapy for himself.", "There is a difference between extra hands being nice and \"my husband can't realistically be expected to take care of two kids on his own.\"  Yes he can be realistically expected to watch his own kids.", "I\u2019ve done it, and even had the chance for us all to upgrade for pretty cheap one time on the Dreamliner - it\u2019s amazing on those big planes! My kids put their headphones on and watched movies and ate all those snacks and didn\u2019t make a peep! That\u2019s why, outside of the 4 year old needing to go to the bathroom or have food packets opened, really only the baby needs watching. My kids ask every time we fly now if we can book first class, that one time spoiled them even though it was several years ago!"]}
