I am now considered that rich DIL who happens to be a cold bitch, and honestly I don't care.\n\nMy husband's whole salary ends up going to his family (paying almost everything for his parents, somehow one of his siblings is always in an emergency, or a cousin needs help with their business...)

My husband follows me about 10 minutes later. Apparently he tried to pay for her ticket upgrade but it is a full flight.

That isn\u2019t fair. He may be a nice guy, but if he isn\u2019t being used, he\u2019s using you, and he needs to stop. Think about all the money he just gives away.

You may have come from money, but I'll bet you worked your ass off to get the job you have now. They need to respect that it's not your responsibility to pay for them when you CHOOSE to pay for your husband. It sounds like they all need to grow up a lot, and your husband needs to set some serious financial boundaries with his family.\n\nAs someone who also dislikes confrontation I understand that it's super hard to speak up to people who have become used to a certain behavior. It's not easy to bear the shitstorm that follows the initial change, and it sometimes never goes away. \n\nMy two cents is to break down what your husband is actually paying for, decide which things are frivolous and which are actually important expenses for his family (be brutally honest about those things), and then let his family know those unnecessary things are going away ASAP. The important ones he can either choose to still pay for, or he can put together a plan with his family to pay for themselves eventually.

Maybe it\u2019s time you stop paying for everything and get him to pay half or at least contribute so he isn\u2019t a push over anymore.

She was clearly trying to get a hand out from you.  Perhaps you need to stop helping them at all and talk to your husband about it.  He isn't helping, he's enabling.
