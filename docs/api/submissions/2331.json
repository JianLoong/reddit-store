Then she goes and asks us to switch her ticket with our nanny's.\n\nI told her point blank that I wouldn't be doing that, that my nanny is needed to help with the kids (I am useless on a plane because of nausea and the meds, my husband can't realistically be expected to take care of two kids on his own).\n\nShe starts complaining and making a scene, I just turn around and start walking towards the lounge. My husband follows me about 10 minutes later. Apparently he tried to pay for her ticket upgrade but it is a full flight.

It sounds like they all need to grow up a lot, and your husband needs to set some serious financial boundaries with his family.\n\nAs someone who also dislikes confrontation I understand that it's super hard to speak up to people who have become used to a certain behavior. It's not easy to bear the shitstorm that follows the initial change, and it sometimes never goes away. \n\nMy two cents is to break down what your husband is actually paying for, decide which things are frivolous and which are actually important expenses for his family (be brutally honest about those things), and then let his family know those unnecessary things are going away ASAP. The important ones he can either choose to still pay for, or he can put together a plan with his family to pay for themselves eventually.

She was clearly trying to get a hand out from you.  Perhaps you need to stop helping them at all and talk to your husband about it.  He isn't helping, he's enabling.

I know I\u2019ve given him more back since then, and have always tried to make it back to town to help him whenever I can with stuff around the house, but still\u2026\n\nIt was hard for me not to resent the whole family because of this but I realized it was a few people.\n\nI feel like I never wanted for much as a kid but didn\u2019t realize how much better I could have had it if my dad wasn\u2019t a pushover.\n\nThe one thing we argue about is his need to help people who refuse to help themselves.  I don\u2019t want his money, never have.  We do fine as a family on our own.  Not like he did, but we do well.\n\nBut damn I wish he hadn\u2019t blown everything so he and my mom could have had more time together after his first retirement.

If you don't spend the full 100, roll it over to the next budget cycle as extra funding to be spent there like spending 50 in September/October to spend 200 in December for Christmas. \n\nThat way you don't have to stop during a highly emotional situation to calculate whether you can afford to help or what you might regret doing because you've got that exact amount in your brain already.

It's wonderful to be able to love and trust people so wholeheartedly! But, unfortunately, not everyone can be trusted and that is the danger of Williams Syndrome. \n\nIn some ways its social affects seem to mirror that of antisocial personality disorder: a huge misconception of ASPD is that they're fundamentally bad people, but even if empathy is unnatural to them they can learn how to interact with society by consciously learning what actions are \"good\" and \"bad\". Williams Syndrome almost seems to have the opposite of that particular trait: they lack a certain ability to *not* empathize and trust, so it takes a certain amount of training to learn how to function in healthy ways with people where they won't be taken advantage of."]}
