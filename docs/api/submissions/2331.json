It sounds like they all need to grow up a lot, and your husband needs to set some serious financial boundaries with his family.\n\nAs someone who also dislikes confrontation I understand that it's super hard to speak up to people who have become used to a certain behavior. It's not easy to bear the shitstorm that follows the initial change, and it sometimes never goes away. \n\nMy two cents is to break down what your husband is actually paying for, decide which things are frivolous and which are actually important expenses for his family (be brutally honest about those things), and then let his family know those unnecessary things are going away ASAP. The important ones he can either choose to still pay for, or he can put together a plan with his family to pay for themselves eventually.

She was clearly trying to get a hand out from you.  Perhaps you need to stop helping them at all and talk to your husband about it.  He isn't helping, he's enabling.
