Their parents, my brother and SIL, passed from an accident a year ago. They\u2019re currently staying with my widowed father (71). I also have a sister, Maria (43), who\u2019s married but childless. I have good relationships with all my niece and nephews and they\u2019re all good kids. \n\nFor background information, my family is very patriarchal. Women were expected to listen to and serve the men in the family. I grew up seeing my mother and Maria always bending over backwards to do everything to please my father and my brother. We are comfortable financially so they weren\u2019t forced to do back breaking labor, but it was obvious they were second in importance to my father and brother. I was lucky that I was the baby of the family and I was also good at studying. My academic awards brought pride to the family, so I was allowed to skip out on some expectations and obligations my mother and Maria had to do as long as I \u201cmaintain the good work.\u201d I got into a great school and am able to live my own life and have my own business. \n\nRecently my father asked me and Maria to read over the will he was putting together. He explained that Maria and I already received our inheritance from our mother (nothing substantial, by the way) so he wants to leave most of his things to his grandkids. We don\u2019t have a family business, so my father has money, valuables like jewelry, and some real estates like land and buildings for rent. I noticed that my niece got very little compared to her brothers. It will be enough to get her comfortably through university but not much else. I asked my father why such disparity, and he gave BS about keeping things in the family, that my niece will be part of another family once she marries someone. \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything to my father because he can do what he wants with his money. However, I talked to Maria and told her I planned to provide extra money for my niece as a graduation gift as well as giving her more than half of my assets in my will to even out the unfair treatment. My sister, however, called me AH for punishing our nephews when they did nothing wrong.

You are giving your money where you think it will do the most good and you are doing so to even out unfair treatment. Your dad, though, is TA for creating the inequality. No matter what family your niece is deemed to be in, she'll still need money. His refusing to support her makes him a bad family member. You are right to make sure that injustice doesn't stay in the family.", "NTA. It's your money, and you can do what you want. It doesn't seem like equity is big in your family any way, so you should be able to do the same thing even if you're a woman.", "That's really thoughtful. And no, it's not punishing your nephews, it's remedying your father priviliging them while willfully depriving your niece of a fair share. Also, it's your money, and nobody can decide to whom you want to give it but you.", "Yikes the misogyny from everyone but you, NTA.", "NTA.  If you can gracefully keep your peace and allow that your father can do what he likes with his estate, your sister ought to be able to do the same for you.  She certainly doesn't sound as though she's too put out by your niece being \"punished\".  Your niece will already be at a disadvantage given that her brothers will most likely get their inheritance many years before she does even if you do leave her most of your assets.", "NTA. As your father is free to do as he wishes with his assets, so are you.", "NTA- you are leveling a set of patriarchal and unfair circumstances and trying to make it just. Also, your money, your choice! Love doesn\u2019t equate to money but it does help level out the playing field.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your money. But sharing your will information is passive aggressive.", "NTA\n\nI assume Maria isn't calling out grandpa for 'punishing' the nephews?", "NTA.  And what if your niece does not marry?  Not all women do.", "If anyone is being punished, you niece is being punished for being a female.\n\nYour desires for your estate are meant to rectify that.  The nephews will have benefitted from their gender, which you reasonably think is not fair.  \n\nYou are 36.  You are not expecting t  die anytime soon.  It may be decades before you die.  Life happens in the mean time.   !0 yrs from now, you may want to change your estate plans, for other reasons.\n\nNTA but do not tell others what you plan on doing, and when you write a will, make sure it is food proof so a relative won't succeed if they choose to challenge the will.", "NTA - but it is sad your niece will have to struggle for decades longer than her brothers.\nIt is safe to say your father will pass away well before you do so they will receive a sizeable inheritance when they are young and need it.", "NTA - what's good for the goose should be good for the gander.  If you are an AH and are punishing your nephews, then your sister should pull on her big girl pants and go after her father for the same reason.", "NTA I\u2019d do that. And I\u2019d make sure everyone knew you weren\u2019t putting up with the sexist bullshit", "NTA, and the irony is (at least in my experience) that aside from taking their spouse\u2019s name on marriage (if they choose), in many cases the daughter (& by default her husband) spend more time with her family. By default of (often) wives doing the majority of the emotional work, sons often drift into spending less time with their family of origin when they get married. So the grand dad\u2019s notion that the daughter will marry away into a different family is bogus on many levels!", "He can do what he wants. You can do what you want. Sounds like she's lucky to have you looking out for her. Nta", "NTA. No, it's not your nephews' fault, but they WILL benefit from the patriarchy. I'm assuming no one would ever think to suggest THEY share with their sister? Absolutely nothing wrong with you balancing the scales for your niece.", "NTA\n\nIf your sister asks further what you've decided to do with *your* will.\n\n\"Don't worry. I have made it fair and equitable.\"\n\nNote I said *equitable* not equal.\n\nEquality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.", "NTA, it's your money. However; you're only 36. In 50ish years when it's your time, your nieces may easily be the better ones off and happily married with big families in their 60s.\n\nI say make the will and do what you want for now, but keep it to yourself. You don't know what the next 50 years will bring!", "NTA You are just trying to bring a little justice for our sex into your patriarchal family. Like your father, it's your money and you can give it to whomever you please.  Since your nephews will get more money, you want your niece to feel as valued as her brothers and I applaud you for this.\n\nTell your sister it's the 21 century and most women are really tired of being second class citizens.", "NTA. It's your stuff, your decision. The mistake was telling Maria.", "Soft YTA.  It is your money, and you have the right to do with it as you please.  However, since you have good relationships with all three, it would come off a slap to your nephews to do this, despite your intention.  \n\nAt the very least, to mitigate the hurt, if you do go forward with this, try to find some way to make what the nephews receive special so it appears more that you love them equally.  Explaining this over time while you are still alive might help, or it might just hurt them earlier.  Only you can answer that one.", "Don\u2019t share your plans for your nieces.  Your sister is conditioned it seems.  Just do so they get the funds as adults so no one can tell them what to do w any inheritance.", "NTA but make sure to get legal advice to make sure this can\u2019t be contested. I would ensure you specifically state in your will why you have done this", "Damn even the women are misogynistic in ur family thats mega sad NTA", "No NTA. I respect your thoughts and decision. Your sister sounds like she bought into the patriarchy. Helping your niece is very commendable, but maybe a note to your nephews about your reasoning along with a smaller gift.", "Your Father says that by then she will be part of a family that will provide for her. Good news, she's part of your family and you are planning on doing just that.\n\nNTA", "**Thank you for helping to break this generational cycle of inequity and misogyny\u2014and lifting your niece up from the hole she\u2019s always been shoved into.**", "There will always be misogyny,but will we ever live to see the day that it\u2019s not standard practice for some countries?!?

It seems Maria may share what your father believes according to her reaction. Stop telling people your plans for your money and other assets, even if they ask and pester you, and write your will.
