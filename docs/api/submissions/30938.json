I don't think there is anything wrong with your plan, but understand that (1) it is your plan, not a plan by consensus with your sister, (2) your plans may change over time, and (3) your own circumstances may change over time.\n\nIf you convey that you love each of them, seek an executor who will honor your wishes, give as you see fit and remember your loved ones in your will, how you allocate things is as good as anyone else's plans.", "NTA\n\nIf you want, explain the reason in the will.", "NTA. Tell her you'll think about it, but don't change the will. Then if she outlives you and finds out what happened, she can think about bringing it up with you again.", "NTA, the point your sister is using shows that your niece is being punished by her grandfather simply because she was born female. It is your resources to do with as you wish, follow the path that you can live with and that follows YOUR principles.", "NTA.  It's none of anyone's business what you do with your money and if you want to try to make up for your father's bigoted behavior of rewarding only family who carry on the family name (i.e. sons), that's awesome.  If Maria didn't call your dad a jerk for not providing equally for your niece, she's bigoted, too and who cares what she thinks?", "NTA.  I think it's great that you are willing to leave her something. But unless something terrible happens to you, that's another 40-50 years from now and isn't going to help her much or in as timely of a fashion as it would her brothers. It sounds like she'll have enough for university from your father, but if her brothers are getting more then they'll have a jump start on buying a house, starting a business, getting advanced degrees, getting married and starting a family. Things that have a massive, long term impact on quality of life, career decisions and financial security for them and their kids. I think it's worth approaching your father again to advocate for her because while your assets will be appreciated, it won't have nearly the same impact of help as your father's will have.\n\nDoes your father think your niece is going to get anything from her husband's family? He wants to \"keep it in the family\" and only give it to the boys. But if he doesn't give her anything no one else will (you aside since he doesn't know that). Does he understand how much easier this will make the boys lives and how much harder hers will be in comparison? Why should she get so much less security and help just because she may marry a man someday?", "NTA, you can do with your money what you want, just like your father can do so.  And ask Maria when she will be speaking to your father about his punishing his granddaughter in favor of his grandsons?", "\"My sister, however, called me AH for punishing our nephews when they did nothing wrong.\"\n\nYou are not punishing the nephews. You are making a similar choice as your father. Is your father punishing your niece in your sister's eyes. I wonder if the nephews would make the niece \"whole\" by ceding parts of their inheritance to her to make it fair or would they be okay with continuing misogyny further down generations.", "Yta.", "NTA but people  - PLEASE stop telling people what you are putting in your will!  It causes nothing but issues.  Sometimes it can even lead to murder for the money.  Let them find out who gets what when you have died, then you don't have to deal with any of the crap.", "NTA - How are the nephews being punished? They get a big fat inheritance from granddad but niece doesn't? I get that its a different culture, therefore it has different rules but I think Maria needs to get her head out of the sand. Whether it is because the traditions are more ingrained in her than you I don't know but ultimately, it is your money to give to whom you please.\n\nAnd who is to say that what you plan now, will be the same later down the line? The grandkids could be awesome in life, making their own futures financially secure or they may fall by the wayside - doesn't matter.\n\nWell done for acknowledging your niece in this way. At least she will know somebody cared enough to think of her future.", "NTA", "NTA and keep your money since your sister is being like that. When your nieces grow up, you can gift them money without your sister being a part of it.", "NTA\n\nSo it\u2019s okay for him to punish your niece by giving her a smaller inheritance because she\u2019s a woman?\n\nWell done for looking out for your niece. I\u2019d keep an eye on her though, and make sure your Dad doesn\u2019t treat her differently at home than her brothers, like unfair division of chores. And if your Dad is that patriarchal, it might be worth letting her know she can call you if she needs help with anything like gyno appointments, etc.", "I would leave everything to my Niece. It seems like the men are already taken care of.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's your money and you can do with it what you like. Just like your dad did.", "NTA, you aren't \"punishing\" your nephews or taking anything from them, you're just trying to even things out between the siblings by leaving something for your niece.", "NTA.  Your father is free to do what he will with his money, and you are free to do what you will with your money.", "NTA. You are not punishing your nephews. Just ameliorating the systematic inequality your father is determined to uphold. If grandpa wasn't so determined to punish niece for being born with a vagina instead of a penis, there wouldn't be any inequality to address.   \nWhy isn't Maria all up in your father's business for his unfairness and inequality? Why is she supporting him treating his grandchildren unequally? Unless she is going to hound everyone equally for their 'unequal' decisions, she needs to stay in her lane.", "NTA\u2026but not for the reasons you think. There was another similar post recently and the grandfather and grandson were roundly chastised as being misogynostic for GF leaving the ranch to the grandson to keep it in the family\u2026and I can almost guarantee you that if the situation had been reversed and the grand daughter got the ranch they would not have been blasted for being whatever the opposite of misogynistic is. My vote on that one was exactly the same as it is on this one.\n\nYou're NTA for disbursing your money or assets in any manner you see fit\u2026and it doesn't make you either misogynistic or it's opposite if you favor one gender or the other or if you aren't equitable (which was another condemnation reason in the other post). It's simple\u2026it's your money and you're allowed to spend and/or pass it on in any darned manner you like for any reason you have\u2026and the fact that other people don't like your decisions or reasons doesn't make you either misogynistic or it's opposite. \n\nNot only is it perfectly legal to do as you wish\u2026it's also as I had to keep reminding the commenters on the other post your money and hence your decision. I really hate it when genders get treated differently\u2026both in the treatment and in the reaction or labeling that happens one way (misogynistic) but not the other way (it's opposite).", "NTA. Just like it is your dad\u2019s decision to leave his assets as he sees fit, it is also your decision.", "NTA. You may leave your assets as you wish. \ud83d\udc95", "I think it sounds entirely reasonable at this point. Hopefully you won't die for a long time and who knows, you might marry at some point (My great-aunt fell in love and married in her mid-fifties and was ridiculously happy with her spouse for the remainder of her life).\n\nNTA", "\"Struggle for decades\" is a bit dramatic. Even the lesser inheritance is enough to put her through college according to OP. Graduating without loans is a *huge* advantage. If she's struggling, it isn't bc the inheritance was too small.", "> I want to add that she doesn't have to tell anyone what's in her will. She's only 36! \n\nShe did mention giving a disproportionately sized graduation gift as well, which won't be as far down the road or necessarily easy to hide.", "!bot", "I absolutely agree with you\u2026but it's very strange how when it's a woman talking about spending money and leaving assets to her female relatives everybody says it's just fine\u2026but when it was a male leaving assets to male relatives then they're all misogynistic. Double standard much? And the people complaining about the double standard in similar posts regarding male bequests are perfectly fine with this double standard when it's as it is in this post.", "Be prepared for your nephews and sister to resent you though. You can do whatever you want with your money, but that doesn't inure you from strained relationships with your family", "!bot  \nStolen from [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17urkdv/aita_for_planning_to_leave_my_assets_to_my_niece/k960s7y/)", "Bot!

Maybe they'll be able to get advanced degrees for free and she won't be able to afford it. That might set them up for life with highly lucrative careers (if they chose well) while she stays middle class for the rest of their lives. Maybe they get into the housing market earlier and start building equity in their 20s vs their sister in their 30s. The brothers might have enough of a safety net to take a chance on starting a business that could hit it big. Or maybe it fails, but they don't lose their houses over it and she can never take that risk. \n\nIt's wildly unfair and the timing of receiving an inheritance has a huge impact. OP is 36, she may not pass for another 30-50 years. OP's niece will be in her 40s-60s by then. It'll be appreciated I'm sure, but it won't be nearly as impactful of being able to smartly use an inheritance in your 20s.", "No one needs to know the details of her will until she has passed on, so this shouldn't matter.", "Then what *is* the meaning?", "You seem to have a very strange view of \"struggle\".", "And yet, OP is telling Maria about her will right now.", "They got it right.

There's no way she's going to give a graduation gift quietly", "Did she say it out of nowhere? Or did she mention it during a conversation regarding wills? Yeah, maybe try some critical thinking if you are gonna come up with theories.", "It isn't a theory, she literally already told her sister that she's giving her niece a large graduation gift.", "So your sister think you are punishing your nephews by giving them less, but doesn't think your dad is punishing your niece by giving her less? Please point out her hypocrisy.", "Everyone is assy here, but your dad is the wisest one of you all and it shows. He has a point alot of redditors don't understand, she will marry into another family. It would be nice to give everything equally, but let's face it, men keep the bloodline going. \n\nDon't care? That's very liberal of you lol. These commenters are the same ones that will tell your kids to abandon you when your older bc they owe you nothing.", "ur choice. but its also to be an AH. the kids did t do anything wrong. but ur punishing them.", "NTA.
