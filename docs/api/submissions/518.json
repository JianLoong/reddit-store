{"id": 518, "submission_id": "yhucbw", "title": "AITA for being brutally honest to my friend?", "selftext": "I (27f) have a friend (26f) \"Fiona\" who I've known since high school. We were semi close in high school, then lost touch after first year of uni as she took a gap year and I was living in the city.  We randomly reunited 3 years later when she came to the checkout at the store I worked at, and we struck up a friendship straight away. She was my closest friend for around 4 years.\n\nWhen we started hanging out again, Fiona let me know that she had had a breakdown and was at rock bottom for a year, but had managed to get through it. Now she was managing her multiple food allergies and had come out as queer. Over the years her mental health wavered but I hung out with her every week, even if all we did was sit in her lounge saying nothing at all. I didn't do it out of obligation- I loved her company and we had the best laughs together. I also wanted to make sure she still knew I was there when she wasn't feeling great. She also did the same for me, giving me a place to stay when I needed it and other things. We were good friends to each other. \n\nFiona was quite isolated during covid lockdown, and afterwards she became obsessed with the idea of finding a significant other. She was meeting up with boy after boy after questionable boy. She was craving company, so I suggested she could get a part time job to feel like she was out in the community. Fiona kept searching for a boyfriend though, and eventually she found one who walked all over her (he wasn't a monster, but he kept her totally separate from his life and barely communicated with her). \n\nAfter this experience, Fiona decided she wasn't going to take any shit from anyone, and would set out her \"requirements\" from the get go, and if a potential partner didn't meet them, it was bye bye. She met with this boy she'd been talking to for a week on a dating app, and they seemed to have so much in common. However one of Fiona's requirements for her future partner was that they'd love being intimate, so on the first date with this boy, she asked him about his intimate life. The boy was very uncomfortable, but she continued pushing him about it, until he told her that he'd only been intimate with one person years ago, and he doesn't really it. He then proceeded to have a panic attack. The date ended shortly after. \n\nFiona told me about all of this, with a \"I'm sorry he had a panic attack but he wasn't fitting my requirements\" attitude, which I thought was horrible. I thought she would be understanding as she has experienced multiple panic attacks in her life. I told her I thought her behaviour wasn't right, and she hasn't spoken to me since. Should I have been less brutally honest to her as I know she has lots of mental health issues?", "created_utc": 1667173673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhucbw/aita_for_being_brutally_honest_to_my_friend/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
