There\u2019s a saying where I\u2019m from that basically says \u201ca parent is not who made you, but who raised you.\u201d Your mother has been, from what you\u2019ve described, a far better parental figure than your bio parents. If you feel strongly about having your mom walk you down the aisle, this is your choice and not your bio parent\u2019s choice to make.

All in all, congratulations on your big day and enjoy it!", "You are absolutely NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and you get to choose who walks you down the aisle.

Congrats on your upcoming wedding OP.", "NTA what a lovely tribute to your real mother who raised you through her pain of experiencing infidelity. \n\nThis nonsense of the dad walking down the aisle to give away us anachronistic and patriarchal. In 2023 it shouldn\u2019t be an entitlement (same with nonsense if asking the father permission to marry).

It wouldn't matter if you'd been raised by two people who were always together and always raised you. You still get to pick who you want to walk you down the aisle. It's on your dad that he assumed it would be him, without ever asking what you wanted. \n\nI think it's beautiful that you've chosen your bonus-mom.\n\nWishing you and your fiance a lifetime of happiness!", "Nope NTA.

That is a win-win!", "NTA and sounds like no great loss if neither of them come. Your stepmother is your real family.", "Not the AH. Good for you to decide to have your \u201cstep mom\u201d walk you down the aisle. She was there for you and deserves the honor. Blood does not a family make. \nEnjoy your day.
