Especially when she was going through her own shit at the time. Of *course* she should get the honor of walking OP down the aisle!      \n\nLittle rant ahead, but I totally agree with you about the whole \"giving away\" tradition. Neither my late husband or my second husband asked my parents for \"permission\" to propose, and my parents never expected them to. They know I'm my own person and can make the decision for myself.       \n\nBut for the first wedding, I think we all just kind of assumed that my dad would walk me down the aisle (but not really give me away in the traditional sense, just as an escort I guess). But when I told my parents that my second husband and I got engaged, my dad asked if he'd still have the honor (emphasis on *honor*) of walking me down the aisle. I thought it was sweet that he asked, and since it was important to him I was absolutely okay with him escorting me. I would've asked him to do it regardless, but asking first was really sweet. But as a quick disclaimer: I shouldn't have walked by myself anyway because there were steps, and I absolutely would have fallen if I didn't have someone there to hold on to lol.", "It kind of breaks my heart that OP has never been able to count on her bio parents to be supportive and loving, but I am so glad that her \"step\"mom has taken on that role. If I knew who that woman was, I'd send her a bunch of flowers because she sounds like the kind of mom who really deserves them."]}
