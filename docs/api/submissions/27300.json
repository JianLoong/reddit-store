Sounds like your friend is afraid of commitment/vulnerability and was drawn to this guy because he was \"off limits\"... usually that doesn't end well.

I think you are right about everything you said to her. However.. I just wanna point something out. It seems like your friend is engaging in some sort of compulsive hypersexuality.

They started off \"friends\" for a year so they could feel better about it; from the get go I told her what she did was wrong, but tried to be supportive once they were in a relationship for the sake of our friendship. The guy actually wasn't too bad once I got to know him. She started distancing herself from me though, (probably because I knew the truth) but I would catch snippets of toxic behavior.  She had passwords to all his social media, because while she \"trusted\" him she didn't trust other girls.  She didn't like how he smoked pot, so he started lying about it. I kept telling her she couldnt make him change, she either had to learn to live with it or end it with him.  3 years later they broke up over it. Even though we only lived 5 minutes from each other we hadn't hung out for a year, but she calls me in tears saying she needs me. I show up, and start the breakup grieving process; she explains the lead up to their breakup, long story short SHE messed up; not so bad it warranted a breakup per se, but it was enough to give him a reason to end it. Trying to be a good friend I didn't say that, just told her to try and move on. She showed me their texts from the fallout, asking me for my opinion on whether they could salvage the relationship. From what I read he was done, and while I was trying to be gentle about telling her,  she kept asking me to tell her the truth so I told her it didn't look likely. Apparently I was supposed to lie; she wouldn't accept reality, kept saying their love was strong enough to overcome it. \nThis is where I was probably an AH; I texted him saying I was sorry to hear they broke up, but I understood how some people just ended up drifting apart.  She was struggling with the fallout and as soon as he decided how he wanted to move forward to let her know so she could start healing. He said she \"knew\" where he stood; I said ok, glad to hear it. Apparently she didn't though, because a couple days later they were arguing and he let slip \"Even X doesn't think we should be together\" X of course being me.\nLong story short, she blamed their whole breakup on me, demanded I send her the texts between us two. At that point I was done so I screenshot-ed them over and blocked her. I don't speak to her anymore. \n\nNTA; I hope your friendship can survive, but it's on your friend to start recognizing her toxic behavior and fixing it. You need to be as outcome independent as possible...\n\nEdit: grammar and forgot my verdict.", "NTA\n\nShe knew he was in a relationship and still slept with him. That makes her at fault in this situation as well, and doesn't show good morals on her part. \n\nHowever, it makes sense she's comfortable doing casual hookups and scared of dating. There is a different emotional investment with dating, and requires more work than a hookup. You're fine to judge her for sleeping with someone who was in a relationship, but you could stand to be less judgmental about the rest.", "It's not good to be a homewrecker (p.s the boy wrecked his home your friend didn't). It's especially not good to slut shame our friends! Y you are being an a hole in this one.", "I'm surprised with all the NTAs. The thing is, OP, that not all relationships are the same or start the same. It feels like you're slut-shaming your friend. You even blatantly admit that she's not capable of having a \"real\"relationship. That's pretty awful, if you ask me. I feel that you feel superior to her, just becasue you're in a commited relationship. The thing is, that yes, they had sex and he was practically cheating, be he came forward, ended the relationship immediately and they started fresh. It may not be your cup of tea, but not everyone does things the same way. It seems that she may have a chance to a relationship for real, and you're sabotaging her. YTA", ">I do think she is not capable of having a normal, loving relationship with a boy right now. There always has to be a physical relationship going on, even if they just met 5 minutes ago. \n\nThose don't have to be mutually exclusive, you know. The world is a rich tapestry, and some people are more than capable of treating sex as little more than background noise, like a shared interest, that merely smooths the way for building a more robust personal relationship. Some people meet over board games, some meet over sex; that alone doesn't indicate how stable that relationship will be. Don't judge!\n\n*Now, I feel like I can channel my inner* r/relationship_advice *poster here, so time for a rant.*\n\nEver-changing sexual partners? Too nervous for a date? Sounds like a classic case of \"shy with a high libido\" to me. Typical symptoms include finding it easier to ask for a fuck than out for a coffee, and getting subconsciously frustrated when the partner is only interested in the offered one-night stand, and the relationship that ensues is shallow and temporary. Builds over time; results in an unsatisfied craving for emotional intimacy.\n\nIs that love at first sight I hear? No such thing; that's infatuation, physical attraction, passion. Contrast with \"true\" love, which is built over many years of understanding, compassion, and trust. Does your friend understand the difference? Has she ever been in a relationship that matchers the latter? Does she know how such a relationship would be initiated and built?\n\nSounds to me like you've *almost* started explaining the difference. Perhaps she's interpreted your words as a form of judgement, or a patronizing command, or an expression of you misunderstanding her? If you want my advice on how to salvage this, you should apologise to smooth things over again, then either explain your point in a way that conveys more understanding of her specific situation, *or better yet* admit ignorance and ask questions in order to gain that understanding; then go from there. \n\nNTA - What your friend's doing is immature, and betrays that she herself doesn't know what she's doing. Good on you for trying to caution against an obvious catastrophe, but if she doesn't want to listen, then that's her mistake to make.", "NTA- you are just stating the obvious facts! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think you are right. She had a very difficult childhood, and I do think this is her way of dealing with trauma. Multiple friends of our group have tried talking to her about it, but she says there is nothing going on. I am keeping an eye on her, making sure she is okay and hopefully one day she is ready to seek help.", "Yes, the first part of your comment is exactly what I told her. I said that I didn't support this because she knew he had a gf. She asked me if I wasn't happy that she was in love, and I said that I was indeed not happy for her at that moment, because I do not support her actions. I have to say, English is not our first language. I told her this in our own language, but I can't translate it in a better way. Maybe the translation also makes it sound really harsh.", "Oh shit man, I'm sorry, that sucks. I try to distance myself from situations like i described, because I don't wanna be the  ah, but maybe I was too quick to react and i should have waited a little longer.", "You are right. I have to say, i do normally not mind her casual hookups. As long as she is safe, I am okay with it. Not that I have anything to do with it, but still. I realise that in the post, it does sound like I am slutshaming her. That is on me.", "You are right, the boy chose to cheat and end the relationship. But I do think it is disrespectful to have sex with someone that has a gf and you know about it. But of course, opinions are allowed to be different :)", "You are right, every relationship starts in a different way. I said that I think she is not capable of having a 'real' relationship because similar situations happened in the past. She has had relationships, and I loved that for her, but it always ended up with her cheating on him, or the bf on her. I see that as having no respect for the other person. I talked to her about that, and she says that life is too short to not have fun. I get that, but in my opinion, you are not ready for a committed relationship at that point.", "Thank you for your answer! You are absolutely right about the sex-thing. I didn't look at it that way, makes me feel a bit ignorant and too judgy. I am going to talk to her and will get into it open minded.", "Don't you think someone is a homewrecker when she has sex with someone when that person is in a relationship? And she KNOWS this? I think that is being a homewrecker, to me it doesn't matter if the person is in a relationship for a year or for 14 years. In my opinion, it is utterly disrespectful. And I do absolutely not feel superior to my friend. I have supported her with everything she does and I am proud of her, but not of this decision."]}
