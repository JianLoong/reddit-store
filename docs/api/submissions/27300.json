She goes out every weekend and goes home with different boys most of those weekends. I am ok with that, as long as she is safe and tells us (friend group) where she is. She is kind of 'known' in the area to get around with a lot of boys. She knows this, but always says it's 'not that bad'.\n\nShe told me she really wants to have a serious relationship, but is too nervous to go on a date. She thinks that is awkward, even though she meets up with total strangers every weekend when she is drunk. Tbh, I do think she is not capable of having a normal, loving relationship with a boy right now. There always has to be a physical relationship going on with the boy she meets, even if they just met 5 minutes ago. I told her this (other people also told her this), but she doesn't wanna hear it.\n\nRecently she met a boy in school. They have been flirting a lot (she told me), and she said she really likes him. But - what turns out - this boy has a girlfriend, they are together for over a year. My friend knows this. I told her I don't support this situation, because I don't think it's good that she will be a 'homewrecker'. I suggested that she maybe could better quit with it, because I felt bad for the girlfriend. She said it was the responsibility of the boy, and even though she felt bad for the girlfriend, she could't help herself. She still met up with him, and they had sex. The girlfriend of this boy didn't know this. 2 days after this incident, she texted me that she was madly in love and that the boy broke up with his girlfriend and told her everything. My friend and this boy will now start dating to really get to know each other better.\n\nI told her I did not support what she did, even though it might have been the responsibility of the boy. I said I wasn't happy for her, because she knew he had a relationship and she still chose to have sex with him. I said that her relationship with this boy will now never be build on trust.

Sounds like your friend is afraid of commitment/vulnerability and was drawn to this guy because he was \"off limits\"... usually that doesn't end well. She's being flooded with that new-relationship-energy right now so she almost certainly won't listen to your warnings, and honestly at this point the guy has already broken up with his (ex) girlfriend, or says he has, so the damage is done. No use putting any more energy into trying to change her mind, but you're NTA for speaking up when you did.", "NTA - it\u2019s really weird that he left his girlfriend of over a year for someone he just met.\nBut there use in talking about it with her anymore. Just sit back and watch the train wreck when one of them inevitably cheats on the other.", "NTA she behaved inappropriately.", "NTA. It seems like she expects friends to be an echo chamber to support her decisions no matter what and if they don\u2019t she deliberately ignores it. You did the right thing speaking up.", "you're right, since she knew this boy was in a relationship, she should have stopped seeing him.  it's both his fault and her fault.  if she didn't know, and he lied to her, that would've been all on him.\n\nyou aren't \\*not\\* happy for her because she's in love.  you're upset at the choices she makes, and how one of those choices affected another person.  i don't think you're TA, but you didn't have to say you aren't happy for her.  i think if you want to talk to her, you should be straight with her about how you feel about her choices.  but saying you aren't happy for her isn't what you really want to say to her, is it?  that's hurtful, do you really want to hurt her?  hopefully she learns a lesson when this guy eventually cheats on her.  or, maybe she'll be the one to cheat.", "Nta. I think you are right about everything you said to her. However.. I just wanna point something out. It seems like your friend is engaging in some sort of compulsive hypersexuality. That sort of behavior could be a trauma response or an unhealthy way to cope with something going on in her mind. I know because I used to do that sort of stuff a lot. It seems like you care about her so maybe you can try to talk to her about it and encourage her to seek therapy.", "Homewrecker? \ud83e\udd23 You are only \"friends\" with her because you feel superior.

Sorry, but that chick deliberately and knowingly fucked a guy  she knew was in a relationship. Op is 100% right to judge BOTH of these heartless homewreckers (since you feel the need to judge Op for judging the girl homewrecker: how do you feel about the cheating asshole she 'scored'?) what exactly does a person need to do wrong so you won't ask them if \"they're perfect\" when they condem an action such as cheating?\n\n\"This guy got drunk and plowed right into a family, but then, there are people puking into trash cans, so let's not judge him; nobody's perfect!\" - That's how you sound to me...", "She didn't murder anybody, young one.
