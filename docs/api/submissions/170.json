They have a right to do what they like in a common area especially during normal awake hours.  Talking with them and working it out together isn\u2019t a big deal if you\u2019re willing to make compromises and not demands.  Be prepared, though, to purchase some earplugs or noise canceling earbuds/phones in case it doesn\u2019t work out.", "NTA. Your responsibility is to communicate the problem. (Can't hold something against a person if you never tell them it's a problem.) It's their responsibility to adjust their actions. Your request is reasonable, and they're being disrespectful by ignoring the request. It makes sense that you're starting to feel irritated.\n\nIf they're reasonable people themselves, then you may need to complain every time it happens, when it's happening. Sucks, but it might finally get through their thick skulls.\n\nIf they ignore your request directly after you make it then it might be time to find new roommates.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
