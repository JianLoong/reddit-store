Sometimes things change that kill old traditions, sometimes things change that make life tougher, sometimes things break that you just can't put together again. And you have to move with it - you can't always hold on to an idea that worked in the past - it's great to aspire to the idea that you'll be able to do X together for another 40 years or carry on a certain thing to the next generation, but it doesn't always work out and eventually you have to stop pretending that it will.   \nThis might be your moment - something irreparable has happened, and you as a parent should not have to choose one child over the other - but you may have to compromise your time between them if they are unwilling to be around each other any more, and you may have to leave some old traditions behind, like big family gatherings where everyone is all there for every single one of them.", "NTA.\n\nThis comes down to three main points for me.\n\n1.
