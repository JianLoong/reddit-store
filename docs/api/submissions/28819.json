She cheated on him, which is just as bad, if not worse, than killing his dog.\n\nYou need to understand the gravity many people assign to cheating. I consider cheating a form of torture and believe it should carry the same penalties. No different than if she waterboarded or electrocuted him in the basement. Just because it wasn't physical doesn't mean it's not torture, in fact its much harder to heal the mind than the body. \n\nIf your daughter had chained up her ex and drilled holes in his kneecaps, would you understand why your son didn't want to associate with her?

All I know is your son is an adult. I see a lot of posts like this from parents, and honestly, I get it. You want your family to be all together and get along. Nothing wrong with that. Where you went wrong is giving your son an ultimatum. As parents, we get used to telling our children what to do. The problem here is they are not children. They are adults, fully capable of making their own decisions. Your son and daughter are fighting. It sucks, but nothing you can do about it. When our children become adults, the only thing we can do is advise but never demand. We have no right to demand anymore. Some people may disagree and say \u201cno, I\u2019m the parent, that is my right.\u201d But those are the parents who usually have a bad to no relationship with their adult children.", "I suspect your son may be projecting\u2026 Does he have a partner?", "Cheating is not a \"mistake\".

I didn't say I don't have any female friends. What does it mean? That I actually do enjoy my friendships with my female friends who stay away from drama.

(It actually did happen two weeks ago.) I don't need that kind of behavior in my life.\n\nI also said I don't see any misogyny because there isn't any to be seen. It doesn't mean that it cannot be the reason. It only means the OP didn't refer to it in any detail so you are making an assumption without any proof.
