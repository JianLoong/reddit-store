Without conversations regarding this adult content, teens are going to soak up everything they find and not be able to parse out that no it\u2019s not romantic and passionate when your partner yells at you.\n\nWith true crime, the genre is overwhelmingly toxic. Content creators will exaggerate events or misrepresent them to make things more juicy, they\u2019ll blatantly ignoring requests from victims or family of victims to not make content about their trauma, and they\u2019ll cross boundaries or make theories up that hurt real people. When you\u2019re monetizing some of the worst things that can happen to a person, a real person, it\u2019s really easy to cross boundaries. \n\nSo yeah maybe the kid has a true interest in this but you need boundaries and open discussion about good channels/creators and how to respect the deceased.

I honestly don't think that's necessary (since I started watching true crime content at a younger age), but it might give your ex some peace of mind knowing that it's at least content you have approved. But either way, you are NTA so don't stress over it too much", "NTA. My friend recently asked me why I watch true crime shows. I told her it is because I like watching the criminal get caught and sentenced. It is very gratifying.", "NTA - I watched similar things as well as all the CSI shows with my mom when I was around 10-12 (not sure exactly when ) it was fine.", "LOL, I\u2019ve binge watched a bunch of Investigation Discovery shows and it hasn\u2019t done anything to me, beyond maybe damage some of my faith in humanity.\n\nNTA", "I got really into true crime around the same age as your kid, and in two weeks I'll be submitting my criminology dissertation on cyber stalking. If I hadn't gotten so obsessed with true crime when I was younger I would have never even considered this as a career path. \n\nOf course there would be an issue if he had suddenly started imitating the criminals he hears about, but as long as his most worrying behaviours are the same behaviour problems that every single other fourteen year old out there has I wouldn't worry too much.", "NTA\n\nMy kids still joke about how they would go to sleep listening to true crime with no problem but Scooby Doo caused one nightmares. \n\nCould your son listen to podcasts instead (with earbuds) while there? There's a lot of podcasts out there that your ex might not realize are true crime. Or it might just be he has to not listen while at his dad's. \n\nMy household always has true crime, unsolved crimes, or paranormal stories playing.", "I love Simon and the writers gang (and queen Jenn of course). Their research is impeccable and extremely sensitive to the victims imo.", "Good ol Barbara Cartland \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Phsaw, I was reading Stephen King at 9!  My father had Desperation mailed to him, when I started reading it he gave me Needful Things so he could read his new book in peace.  (Probably chosen for being the fattest book on the shelf?)  I showed up the next morning asking if he was finished with Desperation yet, and he just gave me a look and gave me Pet Sematary.  At that point I figured out that he had a stash of Stephen King books somewhere in the house and raided it on my own.\n\nAgree with the NTA vote!", "It sounds to me like your son already has excellent critical thinking skills.\n\nThe moral issue with true crime is that sometimes it can make a spectacle of a violent event which may still be fresh to the victim(s) and their loved ones. I'm not saying it's impossible to do it sensitively, but sensationalization is not uncommon. That said, the content itself is rarely as gruesome as, say, a horror movie or violent videogame. I would say the content he's viewing is probably not age-inappropriate, but it may be worth discussing journalism ethics with him and encouraging him to think critically about that as well.", "That channel is great I watch it when I work nights", "I like Criminal Lawyer Reacts, as well. Bruce Rivers is very cool.", "It's a really good channel and I was happy to see it mentioned.", "I remember Lace! I was out of school by then. I read all sorts of trash as a kid and young adult and I\u2019m fairly normal.", "\"He said he's not going to argue with me\" yeah it sounds like he's just on a power trip and used to people just doing what their told. True Crime is hugely popular and your doing nothing wrong. If your son starts idolizing Ted Bundy though then you should be worried.\n\nNta", "I think you should listen to and watch the true crime with him. There are some awful things on YouTube so a bit of parental control is good. and it would be something you could do together. I remember watching Star Trek with my dad.", "NTA. Tell him I've been watching Forensic Files since before I hit puberty, a song I've been listening to since I was three is about the vengeful headless ghost of a mercenary, I have no history of behavioral problems, and I'm an aspiring mystery novelist.\n\nThe only advice I have to give is to make sure that he's always cognizant of the fact that true crime stories happened to real people and to think critically about whether the content he consumes glosses over that or glorifies the killer, but I don't see a problem with a kid of his age consuming the genre itself. (And I don't think that advice is exclusive to true crime, either. Tailor it to whatever genre you're consuming.)", "NTA- Your son\u2019s not hurting anybody. NCIS and Law and Order isn\u2019t the same as 50 shades of Grey lmao", "I was obsessed with gory crime from a very young age. My mom caught me looking at bodies on rotten.com around 12 ish?

It\u2019s one of my favorite podcasts.", "I was with you til your parenting jab. ESH.", "NTA.", "I know it wasn\u2019t the intention but I had a little laugh reading this post because it made me remember hiding the supernatural murder mystery books I was reading when I was 12 under the bed and quickly whipping out the cutesy novel about woodland creatures my mother had given me to read whenever I could hear her on the stairs. \n\nNTA. Your son\u2019s interests seem pretty normal to me. Ex husband is overreacting and if there are behavioural problems when his son is with him he should start looking for the real reasons.", "My grandma gave me  Flowers in the Attic at age 9. Didnt grow up to fuck any person I am related to.", "I've been watching Forensic Files since I was ten, and I turned into a meek people pleaser. The two aren't connected, but it shows that true crime doesn't automatically cause behavioral problems.", "How kind of her to give you something to light up the fireplace.", "For what it's worth, I've been consuming true crime content since the early 90s and I have no behavioral issues that I can think of lol.", "It\u2019s called copaganda for a reason! Network television really does convince people the police are here to protect citizens when that is so far from reality it\u2019s hilarious. Pretty smart 14 year old.", "I was in criminal justice and listen to a lot of true crime podcasts. Just make sure your son knows that are lot of them are biased in other ways.", "Don't remind me. I can talk about my top ten weird cases in each continent and still need to create scripts in my mind to greet people.", "JCS is actually incredibly pseudoscientific and biased toward the police.", "Policeical!", "Explore With Us have some good videos, but they're soooo sensationalised - Matt Orchard and JCS are a lot more balanced (and though Matt Orchard can definitely get a bit snarky, it's not the same kind of emotionally loaded commentary as Explore With Us). Things like referring to the \"sick, twisted mind of the monster who would so callously take her life mere hours after this photo was taken\". \n\nI'm a social worker and Explore With Us can also be pretty bad with interpreting behaviour to suit the outcome of the case (which is obviously easy to do with hindsight). I still enjoy the channel and watch all their videos because they're very interesting and entertaining, but you have to take it with a big lump of salt because it's definitely not as academically sound as the other channels I mentioned. It has fantastic information on some aspects, *especially* the Reid technique, but the psychological/behavioural analyses sometimes make me roll my eyes haha, and at least once I've become annoyed enough to turn off the video entirely because it was so bad. He can be pretty good with explaining there's a range of normal behaviour sometimes, but then other times is so narrow and definitive in his interpretations. \n\nDefinitely more entertainment value and less educational - worth watching, but I wouldn't put it in the same category as JCS which is imo the original and the best :)", "Everybody I know agrees with you.", "I second Casual Criminalist! Such a good show. He does it as a podcast and as a YouTube channel so it can be consumed either way.", "I know I usually have it on YouTube and listen to it as I\u2019m going about things around my house as this way I can just listen but if something really peaks my interest I can shift more focus to it and watch as well. \n\nI just love the sarcasm, genuine emotion and the asides (his asides remind me of my meandering thought process lol)", "lol, I think there are a lot of us with a bit of that Whistler tangent mindset.", "NTA. I love true crime, have been watching/reading about it since I was younger than him. It's partly what has fueled my fascination with genetics and forensics in general. I am a mostly well behaved law abiding citizen of middle age. I have committed no crimes (at least nothing worse than J walking or the rare illegal U turn) One thing that true crime teaches you is that its nearly impossible to get away with major crimes anymore and those that do, it's because of sheer dumb luck. Also, just because they do manage to get away with it at first, doesn't mean that that will remain true. Cold case detectives have solved decades old cases. And the technology is ever improving. It will not cause your son to suddenly become a criminal.", "NTA, I watched true crime with my mum all the time at a much earlier age. We also watched Matlock, Hunter, Sherlock Holmes, America's Most Wanted... \n\nTrue crime is a fact of life in that it happens. Now, if he were being creepy with it, it might be a problem, but it's just an interest in a topic, albeit a grisly one.", "I have always held the belief that if a person\u2026 child or adult, has the intellectual capacity to develop a question set, and the courage to ask the question, then they have a perfect right to have that question set answered both thoroughly and honestly. That said, it sounds to me that your young man has a keen interest in this knowledge set and the intellect to pursue it and to fully comprehend and understand the answers he finds. At 14 years old he is on the cusp of early adulthood. This is the time that as a parent, one would have a responsibility to their young adult child to allow them to pursue the the adulthood they Are going to grow into. My belief is that it is a parents obligation Provide. That encompasses literally everything they need for a successful adult life to come. This includes to actively invest in their children\u2019s futures by refraining from stifling their interests for that express purpose.", "My mom showed me rotten.com when I was in middle school and I'm still a (mostly) law abiding citizen.\n\nNTA", "I started watching CSI and Bones when I was like 10 and that quickly segued into true crime. I just turned 27 and I'm about to finish my PhD in forensic anthropology and taphonomy.

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m allowed to post the link, so just go on YouTube and search \u201cSkip Intro copaganda.\u201d It\u2019s an incredibly well-researched, interesting, and informative series.", "I think as long as you're aware of the type of content your kid is consuming, and he's handling it okay then it's fine. Just maybe make sure to check in with him now and see what he's learning from these shows, to make sure he's taking the *right* things from them.\n\nFor instance, a teenage boy could learn a lot about the dangers women face in their lives day to day, it could make him more aware of his privilege and more compassionate if he sees women in vulnerable situations. You also learn a lot about racial injustices, and how easily an investigation can be ruined by political agendas or the desire cops have to 'put anyone away' for a crime instead of the RIGHT person.\n\nBut I think a lot of people who don't consume true crime content just think that what people are going to learn is how to get away with crimes. How to take advantage of vulnerable people. How to manipulate the system etc. And I do think a lot of this depends on how the show handles the crimes, aka do they celebrate serial killers, or condemn them as monsters, or try and understand them? (A lot of them victim blame, too unfortunately).\n\nI'd say because he wants a criminal justice degree he's already getting the right things from these shows, but it never hurts to sit him down and talk to him about it all. Let him tell you what he's learning and it'll act as bonus bonding time between you both!  \n\n\nEdit: I highly recommend the podcasts Buried Bones, Tenfold More Wicked, Criminal, Casefile, and for something less structured, My Favourite Murder!", "Frankly, true crime, as long as it's analytical and technical (like Jim can't swim) as opposed to breathlessly emotional? That's going to give your son a better education in how the world actually works than anything short of law school.\n\nPlease, please, please still vet the YouTube channels he watches. He's 14, not 18.", "We were careful which ones he watched to start off with with. Always gave him the choice to not watch, walk away at any time,but it was ultimately what made him decide what he wanted to do career wise.", "Dreading is also a good channel, he tends to put more focus on the victims side instead of trying to mythologize the perpetrator.", "Definitely this.

I watched a lot of Forensic Files in high school as well as a lot of Law & Order CSI...\n\nThose kinda shows may actually PREVENT crimes because you learn that the science will reveal the truth...", "If you watch True Crime for any amount of time you will immediately encounter multiple examples of the Police messing up what should have been easy cases or straight up ignoring or not giving a fuck about victims for example serial killers love to target Ladies of the Night and the police NEVER used to investigate their disappearances even when it becomes a pattern and it's still happening today. There is no love lost between True Crime \"fans\" and the cops. When the cops do a good job, they get a thumbs up from me. But the amount of compounding victimization and injustice cops have caused in endless scenarios will not be lost on your son I promise you.", "Crime junkie,  anatomy of murder, serial killers, the deck, and the deck investigate.
