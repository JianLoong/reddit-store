Recently my son and his dad had a fight, because his dad refused to let him watch true crime even in his room with headphones on. My son said he watches it all the time at my house, and my ex called me and said not to let him anymore. I said no, that he can't make that decision for me in my home.\n\nMy ex said that kind of content causes behavioral problems. I asked what kind of behavioral problems he has observed. He said our son has been defiant and argumentative. I said that's just being fourteen, and I'm not having many problems in those areas at my house, so maybe his parenting is the issue, not mine.\n\nHe said he's not going to argue with me and that I need to ban the true crime.

If you\u2019re letting him go crazy on it where he\u2019s obsessed and is spending too much time on it then you\u2019re allowing obsessive behavior which can be a sign of an issue.

I'm a therapist and have worked with teens for twenty years and I'm telling you there is nothing to worry about. If he ends up getting into trouble, it won't be because of watching true crime.

Now it\u2019s a habitual part of my routine. \n\nI\u2019ll be the first to say that your son should NOT be listening to it. There are really important things to learn from the genre, but right now, its a financially hot market for content creators. While your son might currently be listening to \u201cacademic\u201d content, it\u2019s a fast slip into other spaces that are not handling the stories as clinically or carefully. Nightmare fuel sells. And if you\u2019re regularly consuming this content, you\u2019d be surprised how quickly you can become desensitized to things like serial rape and child murder. That is HORRIBLE for a developing mind. \n\nAbout the \u201cbehavioral problems\u201d. Listening to this genre probably won\u2019t make your kid violent. BUT- in my own life, it has created a huge burden of fear and I live with a ton of unnecessary anxiety. \n\nThe dose makes the poison, and if your kid is listening to it \u201call the time\u201d - he\u2019s going to develop a really warped view of the world. YTA if you\u2019re letting him consume this content unchecked.\n\nEdit: I want to add this- I grew up with divorced parents and the protectiveness of \u201cmy house my rules\u201d is understandable. But regardless of what your Ex says, this content is not good for your kid.", "NTA\nI listened to true crime at that age. I have never committed a crime, gotten drunk or done drugs.", "Just so confused about \u201cacademic.\u201d I don\u2019t watch true crime because I think it\u2019s creepy, but I know it\u2019s popular. But from trailers I\u2019ve seen/what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s often very dramatic and over the top and salacious, not educational.\n\nI don\u2019t know your kid but if someone told me their fourteen year old\u2019s son\u2019s hobby was true crime I would think it was a little weird. Like they spend their time taking in media about murder and rape.", "NTA. But your ex sure is and no watching true crime will not do what he claims it will do\n\nAs long as you see no issue with your son watching it and it gives him an interest in a career one day I see no problem with him watching it either\n\nEdited to add: I watched true crime when I was younger and my parents never had a problem with it. I used to watch Forensic Files and Unsolved Mysteries", "YTA. First, if anyone thinks true crime dramas prepare a person for a career in the criminal justice system -- oh my you need a reality check (yes, I've worked in the criminal justice system). I believe your ex is concerned that unlimited overload of that content at that age is inappropriate (even if he didn't state it well) which it IS (murder, rape, etc), and your response was that his parenting sucks rather than have a discussion about why limiting this type of content might be a better idea at this point - because you think it's preparing your kid for a career?\n\nGood luck with that.", "NTA. But true crime content, even if well-done, can be considered a bit pornographic in the sense that it feeds an interest in the worst of human beings and searches to elicit an emotional/morbid response (using pornographic not in the sexual sense here).\n\nIf -hopefully- your kid has other interests, I would encourage him to focus on those while at his dad\u2019s. If that\u2019s all he is interested in, I would worry just a little bit and consider if you want to encourage him to look into other areas that have to do with law, for example or something completely different. \n\nI know some teenagers go through phases of focusing on one single subject, but it\u2019s still good to keep a bit of balance.", "YTA. \n\nI don't have a problem with the kid watching True crime content. I myself watch a lot of True crime content. \n\nWhat I think is problematic is the amount of it. Sounds like he's been watching a lot of it and that he doesn't really have other interests.", "no opinion but maybe your ex doesnt let the son watch it because hes still young? however if he's interested in it as a career well not much to do then", "YTA 14 is WAY TOO YOUNG to be listening ro women being rape, people dismembered, etc.", "YTA-14 is way too young for that and it sounds like he watches a lot of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You could just as easily get a warped view of the world by reading the news which is pretty much a relentless barrage of true crime with constant murders and doomsdaying about how terrible the world is.

Don\u2019t listen to people shaming him.\n\nSide note, his defiance to his dad is normal his age. My little half brother is 15 right now and he was way more defiant when his parents wouldn\u2019t help him pursue his interests. He felt like he wasn\u2019t good enough or he couldn\u2019t ever be good enough. He was interested in luxury cars and mechanical work. So I started taking him to luxury car dealerships and he got to talk with the techs and sales people and got to see and sit in luxury cars and over time he gained self confidence, self respect, stronger respect for others and others things, etc. When he knew his interests were encouraged as legitimate and real and he was being treated with respect, he went from defiant to better behaved. Not just for me (his older sister), but for his parents. He helped more around the house, he\u2019d willingly scrape snow off their cars, shovel the drive way, he stopped being up all night playing video games and hiding from the world. He made friends and started exploring the outdoors. He willingly tries to spend more time with his parents without prompting. He wants to do good things for them and others. Why? Kids are defiant and act out at times to control anything they can if they aren\u2019t able to start taking some small control over their life and interests. It\u2019s only a few more years until your son is an adult, encouraging legitimate educational pursuits as legitimate without shaming or judging does more good than many give credit for. I agree with you, the defiance to his dad isn\u2019t because of true crime, it\u2019s likely because he feels devalued and disrespected as a kid trying to grow up little by little", "So cool.
