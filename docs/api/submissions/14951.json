Maybe limit his intake....\"hey dude, can you watch something else for a bit? Give your mind a break, let's watch something silly.\" But True Crime is very interesting...that's why Law & Order was/is so successful for so long.

In 2005 Bones came out and I got to live vicariously through the characters. In 2005 I also had my eldest, who grew up watching with me.  They will be majoring in CSI and art in order to become a forensic art specialist, like their favorite character. They watch and listen to true crime plenty to prepare themselves for this as to understand what is real vs tv magic.\n\n\nI watched Doctor Who with my son (12), and he wants to be a aerospace engineer or astrophysicist and dreams of working for NASA. \n\n\nKid\u2019s entertain themselves with things they want to do when they grow up", "The true crime here would be paying for a criminal justice degree, when a HS diploma is sufficient for most jobs in the field. Sorry, couldn't resist the pun, but in all seriousness, if he wants to go the 3-letter agency route rather than a police department, he should probably consider a degree in a STEM field.

I don't know what the ex's problem is, but I'm pretty sure the actual problem is with the stepmom.  Bet she doesn't want to hear anything but Disney.\n\nI don't remember watching a lot of TV after I had kids, but I never missed an episode of Columbo, Ironside, Quincy, Murder She Wrote - yeah, I even watched Perry Mason reruns when I could get them - in short, I'm a murder mystery junkie.  Moved on to Law & Order and NCIS, but then WE GOT DISH TV!  Oh yeah, Forensic Files, Snapped, 48 Hours, Cold Case, True Detective - gobbled them up.  My granddaughter lived with us from the age of 7 to 12.  Now she is 25 and her only 'behavioral problem' is that her mom wants her to live with her but she insists on being independent instead.  Must be from exposure to true crime programs, right?", "Im not unbiased here since i also watch a lot of true crime.\n\nImho there are 2 kinds of people who watch true crime, people who sympathise with victims and people who worship the criminals.\n\nAs long as you're sure your son is the former and not the latter NTA\n\nAt his age, i would definitely recommend you watch with him, or at least watch the same things he wants to watch, so you can discuss the content and your sons reaction and motivations.", "I\u2019ve seen way more gross stuff doing a medical chart review than I\u2019ve ever seen on a true crime show. I also feel that, as his age, if he finds something too disturbing, he\u2019ll have the sense to fast forward or shut it off. \n\nHis father\u2019s reasoning reminds me of a conversation I once had with my sister. I taught high school for 10 years, and my sister would sometimes say things like \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Nephew the Elder acts like that.\u201d And I would tell her \u201cbecause he\u2019s a 13-year-old boy.\u201d \n\nYou are NTA.", "OP, NTA. Did he watch Dateline growing up? Because I sure was at that age. I'm not a serial killer or a criminal. It's fine. My 15 year old has been obsessed with military stuff for about a year saying he is thinking about a career in the Air Force. So he has been watching military movies & documentaries, reading the news, listening to podcasts. Your son will either get over it or will turn it into a career. Your ex is TA for suggesting that his own misguided views are more important than your son.", "NTA. My eldest is near the same age and shes getting into true crime now and i was around the same age when i got into it. I was so fire sure i was gonna be a csi. I loved that show so much. \n\nMy fave youtuber is That Chapter (fellow irish person) and hes good craic as well. Coffeehouse Crime is good but i find him kind of monotone. \n\nI didnt turn into a mad serial killer or anything from devouring true crime mags or docs or books. Your ex seems to be going over the top a bit\n\nNTA", "I'm not sure that fictional shows and the news are as bad as some of the True Crime podcasts. I listened to one episode of Sword and Scale that was so horrible that I still get sick to my stomach thinking about it. I turned it off during the episode while yelling \"turn it off turn it off\" at myself to drown out the words while I was speeding down the highway on a road trip - it was like my brain was stuck and I couldn't remember that I could turn the volume down. Maybe I'm not watching the same shows on network or cable, but all the episodes of Law and Order SUV could not have prepared me for how awful it was. Sword and Scale is by and large really interesting and some of the episodes are great but holy jesus some are just too gruesome for me.", "I read both erotica and listened to true crime and I'm the least violent person i know \ud83d\ude02 and i am also not a prostitute", "I love how pretty much every thread on this post is full of recommendations for true crime and law stuff.", "> He said it's heavily influenced by and biased towards police departments.\n\nYou have a really smart kid.

I like his (and his writers') empathetic approach that acknowledges the victims as real people who deserved better and their killers as the bad guys.\n\nExcept Ken McElroy, the episode I'm watching now and one of my favorite true crime stories. He deserved it.", "No wonder hes an ex.", "Please shut up and go back in your hole with this absolute bullshit comment.

Similar vein to JCS and EWU, but also points out some inconsistencies with certain psychological techniques and beliefs. \n\nSome crime content is really not ethical. I really dislike the mukbang true crime content and the ones where they exploit victims for views (the podcast side of true crime are really bad for this). \n\nI have consumed true crime media since I was 10 (similar situation to OPs son, I just never completed my degree). Yes it can be gory and upsetting. But in the same breath studying crime is a good way to understand motivations and ways to try and prevent it (broken windows theory for example). So I'm going with NTA. \n\nI think OPs son is acting out because his dad says his way or no way at all.", "I went through a phase of listening to the case files podcasts while playing games on my switch, it was always interesting to listen to.

I like John Oliver a lot. He\u2019s very informative, and I think it\u2019s great that your son is so aware of his own interests AND has a parent that supports them!"]}
