The content is intense, but it's very academic for the most part.\n\nMy ex doesn't let our son listen to or watch true crime at his house, which I assumed is because he and his wife have elementary age kids at the house, and of course they shouldn't be exposed to such things. Recently my son and his dad had a fight, because his dad refused to let him watch true crime even in his room with headphones on. My son said he watches it all the time at my house, and my ex called me and said not to let him anymore. I said no, that he can't make that decision for me in my home.\n\nMy ex said that kind of content causes behavioral problems. I asked what kind of behavioral problems he has observed. He said our son has been defiant and argumentative. I said that's just being fourteen, and I'm not having many problems in those areas at my house, so maybe his parenting is the issue, not mine.\n\nHe said he's not going to argue with me and that I need to ban the true crime.

If he was truly concerned he would have laid out a better argument.  \n\nI will say as long as you are monitoring and discussing the crime shows with your son then NTA.  If you\u2019re letting him go crazy on it where he\u2019s obsessed and is spending too much time on it then you\u2019re allowing obsessive behavior which can be a sign of an issue. Make sure he\u2019s watching 14 year old shows and not something he\u2019s not yet equipped to deal with.  You have to be active in this interest just like you would soccer or anything else.

Your ex is free to ban certain TV shows/media in their own house, but they're the TA for trying to implement house rules in your house.", "NTA. Had the same fascination growing up, which led to attending a great university  where I majored in forensic science and double minored in chem and bio. Led me to the great career I love. I would tell the kiddo to skip watching at Dad\u2019s house and you two can have a little binge night and watch the show together. Sometimes a battle avoided is a battle won.", "Sounds like your son is interested in the educational aspects that don't sensationalise the criminal or the gory aspects of the crimes.\n\nNow there might be a conversation to be had about the level of gore or violence in the shows, but that's true of most TV nowadays. \n\nIt sounds like your ex is either reacting out of ignorance on the subject matter (perhaps he's squeamish) or he's powertripping.\n\nNTA in either case.", "NTA\n\nBut if you're going with the \"my house, my rules\" argument, you need to let your ex do the same.

It's ex's behaviour that is concerning. He will alienate your son if he keeps it up.", "NTA. \nI also watched true crime content when I was his age, even younger because I really loved it at the time and it didn't affect me in any way. I love to watch it today too, but I just don't have enough time to do it so often as I did when I was a kid.", "NTA me and my mum used to watch these all the time.\n\nIt sounds as though you have a smart intelligent son there and he will go on to challenge and question things at college and uni.", "NTA.

It's be great if you could be a united front, though.\n\nThat said, I'm inclined to agree with the dad that some true crime is really intense for a 14 year old. I wouldn't let a kid listen to it (at least not as frequently as yours does), but I don't think that makes you an asshole. I also don't think the dad is wrong for fighting for what he thinks is best for your kid.", "That is nonsense. Your ex is wrong. True crime isn't damaging in any way. I'm a therapist and have worked with teens for twenty years and I'm telling you there is nothing to worry about. If he ends up getting into trouble, it won't be because of watching true crime. I would use this as a teaching opportunity for your son that he doesn't want to grow up to be the kind of man who tries to tell women what to do.", "NTA, and your ex is TA for trying to force you to follow his rules in YOUR home.", "Not exaggerating- I have listened to true crime almost every day since 2016; I\u2019m an artist/painter and in college I started listening to several podcasts to fill up my long studio hours. Now it\u2019s a habitual part of my routine. \n\nI\u2019ll be the first to say that your son should NOT be listening to it. There are really important things to learn from the genre, but right now, its a financially hot market for content creators. While your son might currently be listening to \u201cacademic\u201d content, it\u2019s a fast slip into other spaces that are not handling the stories as clinically or carefully. Nightmare fuel sells. And if you\u2019re regularly consuming this content, you\u2019d be surprised how quickly you can become desensitized to things like serial rape and child murder. That is HORRIBLE for a developing mind. \n\nAbout the \u201cbehavioral problems\u201d. Listening to this genre probably won\u2019t make your kid violent. BUT- in my own life, it has created a huge burden of fear and I live with a ton of unnecessary anxiety. \n\nThe dose makes the poison, and if your kid is listening to it \u201call the time\u201d - he\u2019s going to develop a really warped view of the world. YTA if you\u2019re letting him consume this content unchecked.\n\nEdit: I want to add this- I grew up with divorced parents and the protectiveness of \u201cmy house my rules\u201d is understandable. But regardless of what your Ex says, this content is not good for your kid.", "NTA\nI listened to true crime at that age. I have never committed a crime, gotten drunk or done drugs.", "Just so confused about \u201cacademic.\u201d I don\u2019t watch true crime because I think it\u2019s creepy, but I know it\u2019s popular. But from trailers I\u2019ve seen/what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s often very dramatic and over the top and salacious, not educational.\n\nI don\u2019t know your kid but if someone told me their fourteen year old\u2019s son\u2019s hobby was true crime I would think it was a little weird. Like they spend their time taking in media about murder and rape.", "NTA. But your ex sure is and no watching true crime will not do what he claims it will do\n\nAs long as you see no issue with your son watching it and it gives him an interest in a career one day I see no problem with him watching it either\n\nEdited to add: I watched true crime when I was younger and my parents never had a problem with it. I used to watch Forensic Files and Unsolved Mysteries", "YTA. First, if anyone thinks true crime dramas prepare a person for a career in the criminal justice system -- oh my you need a reality check (yes, I've worked in the criminal justice system). I believe your ex is concerned that unlimited overload of that content at that age is inappropriate (even if he didn't state it well) which it IS (murder, rape, etc), and your response was that his parenting sucks rather than have a discussion about why limiting this type of content might be a better idea at this point - because you think it's preparing your kid for a career?\n\nGood luck with that.", "NTA. But true crime content, even if well-done, can be considered a bit pornographic in the sense that it feeds an interest in the worst of human beings and searches to elicit an emotional/morbid response (using pornographic not in the sexual sense here).\n\nIf -hopefully- your kid has other interests, I would encourage him to focus on those while at his dad\u2019s. If that\u2019s all he is interested in, I would worry just a little bit and consider if you want to encourage him to look into other areas that have to do with law, for example or something completely different. \n\nI know some teenagers go through phases of focusing on one single subject, but it\u2019s still good to keep a bit of balance.", "YTA. \n\nI don't have a problem with the kid watching True crime content. I myself watch a lot of True crime content. \n\nWhat I think is problematic is the amount of it. Sounds like he's been watching a lot of it and that he doesn't really have other interests.", "no opinion but maybe your ex doesnt let the son watch it because hes still young? however if he's interested in it as a career well not much to do then", "YTA 14 is WAY TOO YOUNG to be listening ro women being rape, people dismembered, etc.", "YTA-14 is way too young for that and it sounds like he watches a lot of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
