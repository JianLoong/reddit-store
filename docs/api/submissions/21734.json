My daughter, Diamond,  graduated from high school. Her father is very religious and paid to send her to a catholic high school near us. \n\nThey have a dress code and it applies to hair, but it\u2019s never been an issue before. She is biracial so she has pretty curly hair but not curly enough to grow an afro like my husband. \n\nShe takes good care of it and it looks healthy and presentable. It\u2019s decently long, but that hasn\u2019t been an issue ever before. However slightly before graduation I got contacted by the principal of her school saying she would need to either cut her hair into a bob cut or chemically straighten it with a keratin treatment. I told them she wasn\u2019t going to do a keratin treatment since they can be very bad for your hair but I would ask her if she wanted to cut it, but it was really up to her. \n\nI talked with Diamond and she said she didn\u2019t want to cut her hair. Like I said, it is quite long and I think part of her identity is tied in it as it\u2019s unique because not many people are black or biracial where we live. So it would be more of an emotional issue to cut it, but regardless it would take a long time to grow out. \n\nThey threatened to not let her walk at graduation and I said \u201cFine by me. We won\u2019t be attending graduation.\u201d\n\nMy husband was contacted by the school and called me, very angry. He wasn\u2019t hung up on Diamond cutting her hair, ironically he was also against it, but he was mad that after spending the money he had to send her to this school that he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her walk at graduation. He told me I needed to reason with the school and get them to allow her to walk. \n\nUnfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to convince them, and when I mentioned this to my family they seemed pretty split on if Diamond should have cut it and gone or skipped it like we did. \n\nI never was fond of the school, and I value my daughter\u2019s desires about her bodily autonomy over walking at graduation. But I also realize it\u2019s an emotional thing for most people and I did prevent my husband from seeing that. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688889206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14usiwk/aita_for_not_making_my_daughter_damage_or_cut_her/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did he even bother to give justification to why your daughter needs to change her hair or what impact that has on her attending graduation? E.g. it's \"too distracting\" or some other bullshit?\n\nAs for being asked to chemically straighten her hair - That's fucking despicable. Not even just to straighten / silk press it for the day (still abhorrent but at least it's not permanent or excessively damaging) but to chemically relax it? Something that can't be undone save for growing it out and cutting it off? Absolutely not. That's so deeply routed in racism it's horrific.\n\nCutting it into a bob makes no sense either. Often times (especially if it's not cut by a curl or texture specialist) it can go poofier and sit awkwardly. I can't get my head around how that's a better option. \n\nGood on you for respecting her bodily autonomy.

How dare they dictate what a young woman should do with her hair to be \u2018acceptable\u2019. \n\nPersonally, I think you need a lawyer, if only to stop other young women being subjected to this archaic practice in the future. \n\nWell done for standing your ground. Her dad will have to suck it up. He wanted her there. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. The school enforcing this arbitrary rule over your daughter's natural hair is awful. You did the best you could to advocate for her, and you made sure that she was the one in control of her own body & choices. Good on you! I know she must appreciate your support in this.\n\nI understand her father being upset at not seeing her walk at graduation, but his problem should be with the school administration; not you. If he paid for her to go there, I don't understand why he expected you to convince them to let her walk if he couldn't. It's unfortunate, but these kinds of rules are common with religious schools.", "NTA and whaaaattttt \ud83d\ude33 there are not enough words to say how wrong this is.....", "NTA - where I live, it\u2019d be considered discrimination if a mixed race or black person was told to straighten their hair. To the point the local press would get involved and the school would have to publicly apologise.", "NTA. Graduation ceremonies are nothing more than a way for schools to rip off a bunch of people who think it\u2019s \u201cthe done thing\u201d. \n\nThrow her a massive party (if you can) with her friends at her house and they can wear whatever they want, have their hair however they want. \n\nScrew that school.", "NTA  This is outrageous!\n\n Info:  Do all of the girls have bobs and/or shorter hair? Or are they allowed to have long straight hair?\n\nYour daughter could keep her hair long if she put straightener in it?  Say it's not so!!  So does this mean she couldn't wear it as is because... it was too wide???\n\nAlso, the obvious, did she have the choice to wear it up in say, a bun?", "NTA \n\nIf school makes her cut her hair, then every other girl should also be required to destroy their hair. \n\nI would sue the school.", "NTA-Her hair cannot be natural if she wants to walk the stage? Fuck that. They shouldn\u2019t be trying to take part of her identity from her.\n\n\nI rolled across graduation with red, pink and blue hair with just a bit of actual natural blackish-blue hair showing. My friend who came after me had a Mohawk that was orange and blue. We realize now we looked ridiculous but they allowed it.\n\nThere\u2019s no earthly reason to not allow your daughter to wear her hair as she chooses unless you count bigotry and racism.\n\nCould you still go over their heads to the school board? Someone needs to know what this principal is doing.", "NTA. You stood up for your daughter in the face of unreasonable demands.
