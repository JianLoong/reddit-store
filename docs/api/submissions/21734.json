My daughter, Diamond,  graduated from high school. Her father is very religious and paid to send her to a catholic high school near us. \n\nThey have a dress code and it applies to hair, but it\u2019s never been an issue before. She is biracial so she has pretty curly hair but not curly enough to grow an afro like my husband. \n\nShe takes good care of it and it looks healthy and presentable. It\u2019s decently long, but that hasn\u2019t been an issue ever before. However slightly before graduation I got contacted by the principal of her school saying she would need to either cut her hair into a bob cut or chemically straighten it with a keratin treatment. I told them she wasn\u2019t going to do a keratin treatment since they can be very bad for your hair but I would ask her if she wanted to cut it, but it was really up to her. \n\nI talked with Diamond and she said she didn\u2019t want to cut her hair. Like I said, it is quite long and I think part of her identity is tied in it as it\u2019s unique because not many people are black or biracial where we live. So it would be more of an emotional issue to cut it, but regardless it would take a long time to grow out. \n\nThey threatened to not let her walk at graduation and I said \u201cFine by me. We won\u2019t be attending graduation.\u201d\n\nMy husband was contacted by the school and called me, very angry. He wasn\u2019t hung up on Diamond cutting her hair, ironically he was also against it, but he was mad that after spending the money he had to send her to this school that he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her walk at graduation. He told me I needed to reason with the school and get them to allow her to walk. \n\nUnfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to convince them, and when I mentioned this to my family they seemed pretty split on if Diamond should have cut it and gone or skipped it like we did. \n\nI never was fond of the school, and I value my daughter\u2019s desires about her bodily autonomy over walking at graduation. But I also realize it\u2019s an emotional thing for most people and I did prevent my husband from seeing that. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688889206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14usiwk/aita_for_not_making_my_daughter_damage_or_cut_her/", "score": 1194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did the principal even bother to give justification to why your daughter needs to change her hair or what impact that has on her attending graduation? E.g. it's \"too distracting\" or some other bullshit?\n\nAs for being asked to chemically straighten her hair - That's fucking despicable. Not even just to straighten / silk press it for the day (still abhorrent but at least it's not permanent or excessively damaging) but to chemically relax it? Something that can't be undone save for growing it out and cutting it off? Absolutely not. That's so deeply routed in racism it's horrific.\n\nCutting it into a bob makes no sense either. Often times (especially if it's not cut by a curl or texture specialist) it can go poofier and sit awkwardly. I can't get my head around how that's a better option. \n\nGood on you for respecting her bodily autonomy.
