I asked her how she was going to be able to do that, I laughed and told her that she doesn\u2019t make enough, that she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the bills and that I would not be co-signing for her. As the argument progressed, she told me that she saves everything she makes in a month and that she doesn\u2019t touch any of her money besides what she has to give me. I told her this was impossible because she gets her hair and nails done. \n\nWe were on the freeway exit and as she continued to get smart after I\u2019d asked her to stop and to watch her tone several times, I told her she could find her own ride and pulled over to let her out.
