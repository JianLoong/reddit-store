You and your partner need to put MIL on an information diet because you know everything you say will make its way to BM. It won't be easy, no doubt about it. But you do not need the stress from this toxic person (BM).", "NTA\n\nHowever your husband is an AH for not standing up for you and telling both women to lay off you. He should have put his foot down right when it started.\n\nHold off on telling MIL about this pregnancy.\n\nWhen it's revealed, DH can tell his mother that she might not get to see your children unless she apologizes to you and stops gossiping about you with the BM.", "NTA.\n\ndH is the one who needs to step up and have a firm boundary setting conversation with *his* mother that asking you to abort the child to appease his previous partner is unacceptable, outrageous and freaking ridiculous. \n\nThat decision is between you and your partner and ultimately you. How dare they. It\u2019s understandable that BM might be concerned regarding how much money there is to go around for all these kids and adults but that still doesn\u2019t entitle her to suggest you abort.\n\nNow if DH cannot or will not set the boundary, the question is why.", "NTA and your partner needs to make it crystal clear to their mother that he does not want the BM being involved In His life other than as a coparent.  That\u2019s crazy and gross what she said.", "NTA \n\nYou would be well within your rights to want a modicum of privacy even if they hadn\u2019t said such vile things about your previous pregnancy. If MIL and the ex are genuinely that close, surely they can find something other than you to talk about. \n\nHonestly, I might even put off telling your MIL about the pregnancy as long as possible. She seems to view the whole situation as some kind of ongoing love triangle and she\u2019s rooting for the ex, so I wouldn\u2019t expect her to be respectful or reasonable in response to being told not to discuss it with the ex.", "Wait, wait, wait, wait, she wanted you to abort?! WHAT?! And your MIL just acted as if she wasn't part of the idea? Your partner needs, no, must set boundaries. Btw, MIL wants your partner and BM together and you out of the picture, careful with her.\n\nNTA", "NTA you can ask and it'll be ignored", "I think you should tell MIL and BM to fuck right off and if they don't like it, they can just keep it to themselves.

Why are you even discussing anything with MIL? Why are you even going to family events if BM  bothers you that much? If you're expecting MIL to respect your request, you're in for a rude awakening. \n\nGo LC. You need to talk to your partner.  If he's not going to back you up, then your shit  out of luck.", "Wow that is some pair of balls the BM has. Honestly tho, I feel like this should be your husbands problem, not yours. He should talk to Both BM and his Mother to establish boundaries both you and your husband are comfortable with.", "Wtaf?! No your are absolutely not TA. Who the hell says \u201cwe talked about and you having a baby isn\u2019t a good idea so I\u2019ll go with you to get an abortion\u201d. Like who has the actual audacity to say that to someone?! It\u2019s no one\u2019s business but the parents. Everyone else\u2019s opinions are just background noise. I know BM would be pissed if someone told her that \u201cit\u2019s best for her to abort her child\u201d. She was absolutely just being nasty because she\u2019s probably jealous/worried for her own kid and the fact that his mom was part of it says a lot about her too. I wouldn\u2019t have either of them involved in my pregnancy personally. Wishing ill on an unborn child. Gross.\n\nMIL is probably going to talk to her about it no matter what you ask of her.", "NTA but MIL doesn't sound like she would respect your boundaries", "NTA but she probably will anyway", "NTA.\n\nBM doesn't even get to opine on her ex-husband's new wife getting pregnant, much less try to talk her into aborting her child. She's certainly allowed to speak up and even go to court if she thinks her child (your stepchild) is being treated unfairly, but she has absolutely no business deciding for you whether you can have kids of your own with your husband, who is no longer her husband.\n\nIt's possible that she's hoping to get back together with your husband and raise their child together, but you having children is an obstacle to that. Or it could just be that she wants her child to be your husband's only focus. Perhaps she's worried that her child will be sidelined in favor of your children. And I have to admit, based on the stories I see in this sub, that's a real possibility.\n\nBut she's completely out of line. I would just block her on your phone if she pulls that stunt again.", "wow, you are nta, you are nowhere near. She should have absolutely never asked you to get an abortion which was far overstepping. and MIL needs to put her personal views aside nothing is her choice. it is solely between you and your partner. congratulations on your baby and your expecting baby. if they do that again no is a complete sentence.", "Wait. What??? Why are you even still speaking with your MIL. She and the ex girlfriend ganged up on you to terminate your pregnancy. That should have been it for any type of contact with MIL.  As for the BM, there is no reason for you to ever speak with her.  I am assuming you husband gets his child on a schedule and that means y\u2019all don\u2019t ever need to go to family events with MIL and BM anymore.  And your husband!! WTH he should be no contact with his mother either.", "NTA! Telling you she\u2019ll go with you to an abortion clinic?!?! Those are fighting words\u2026 I would tell her to put a leash on herself before you do it for her. You also need to get your husband to check his mother. Like, she will not be allowed around the grandkids if she doesn\u2019t cut the BS. The audacity!", "It would not be wrong and, because she will clearly talk anyway, sounds like it's time to draw a line where mil is not allowed around if she breaks the rule. Nta", "Why does your MIL need to be included ? I would leave her out as long as possible she\u2019s going to still talk trash with the ex bm", "NTA\n\nBut your problem here is really with your partner (DH). He needs to set boundaries with his mother and ex, which he isn't doing now. There is no reason for her to be invited to every holiday and every family birthday. She can do those things with her family. She and your partner are no longer together. They are co-parents, and there are some things they will do together, like their child's birthday, or they might see each other at preschool events. But this idea that she would be this enmeshed in your partner's life after they've broken up and that your MIL is supporting it and treating her like the DIL she's rooting for is problematic and it's even MORE problematic that your partner DH is like, cool, I'll go along with that. He should set  boundaries with his mother and ex.", "NTA\n\nThis woman tried to pressure you into killing your first child. I wouldn't want her to know anything about the younger.", "NTA. Honey, why the heck are you giving these ladies information about your life?!  Stop it!!! Do t speak to them much. If they ask about the pregnancy say, thanks but let\u2019s talk about climate change.   Your problem is you entertain these ladies and then complain.
