You BOTH need to be rested for tomorrow, as you will not be able to do anything parent-wise after your surgery. \n\nWhile I think you could have communicated how scared you are (men literally need these things spelled out sometimes), he should also be a big boy and be able to figure out that tonight isn\u2019t an appropriate time to have a buddy over for a sleepover.

Good luck tomorrow.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't trivial surgery, it makes total sense that you want your husband to be with you tonight.

The \\*best\\* case scenario I can imagine is that he's realized that his next few weeks will involve taking care of you and doing the things you normally do, so this is his selfish last hurrah for a month or so.

Not only is this a big surgery physically, but emotionally as well. He should be there alongside you helping you relax by providing a calm environment and being present.

He said it wouldn\u2019t go past a certain time; what is that time? You can follow up and like others have said, if he wants to continue, they can go to a bar, but you can have the expectation that the house is quiet at a certain time.\n\nI think having more conversations with your husband will be important, but those can wait.

Your husband should be taking care of you and creating a calm environment to help you recover from surgery. He is very selfish. Does he do this often?", "NAH. People process things differently. In my marriage, we both would be like \"make sure you don't stay up too late-- don't forget we have to be at the hospital early tomorrow.\"  I had major surgery two years ago and the night before was basically any other Wednesday night, except for some dietary restrictions. I'm not contemplative and, if anything, I would have liked to save the quiet night for when I was recovering. \nWith that said, you're entitled to be in the kind of mood, for whatever reason, to be irritated by noises and life in general. \nI think it would have been fine to ask them to go watch the rest of the game at a bar.", "I\u2019m leaning towards ESH. Maybe you should have communicated that\u2019s how you wanted to spend the night prior and he should have also checked. \n\nIf this is your first major surgery, your husband is a bit of an idiot. Obviously, anyone would be that terrified before their first major surgery, but tbh after your first one\u2014the rest of the \u201cregular \u201c major procedures they do day in and day out become a lot easier. I think context is important: I\u2019ve got severe anxiety too with a tendency to overthink, so me saying that is really something!\n\nHowever, it looks like the minute you actually expressed something, it was already a done deal and he tried to compromise if I\u2019m understanding correctly. I also think it\u2019s really important info to know how often he sees this friend and how close they are. It seems like they don\u2019t get to see each other often and maybe your husband needs some support and socializing before having to pick up all the slack while you recover from surgery. It also seems you didn\u2019t give him the chance to even respect the compromise before taking to Reddit. \nIf this is the case, I\u2019m leaning more towards YTA. No one is a mind reader and you need to express what you need in enough time for someone to respond. Sounds like you knew this friend was coming in for some time. If you had concerns, you should have said something the minute those two events coincided in the calendar.", "NTA but I do think it\u2019s a little dramatic because 7:30 is early and a hysterectomy is not a serious or difficult surgery.

I paid the Uber driver an extra $100 to come check me in and come in and get me afterwards. Did it the next 2 surgeries as well. Sometimes you just have to improvise. She\u2019s remarried now and completely miserable so it all worked out, lol", "I know I have often wondered the same thing\u2026 There are countless stories of elderly individuals who just don\u2019t have somebody to sit with them, and therefore they can\u2019t get a procedure\u2026 It\u2019s a very good point and a sad one at that :(((((", "I can\u2019t answer that. I\u2019m not hospital administration. But for safety, you cannot be physically alone for outpatient surgery with general anesthesia which is what this is. I\u2019m in the US if that\u2019s important.", "Doctors can refuse service if they feel the procedure is dangerous \"liability\" yada yada. Basically SOL.", "They probably get a hospital volunteer, then go to a rehab place", "My coworker is struggling to find someone to take her to a (relatively minor) procedure this week. She's from out of town and started here during early COVID so she doesn't know a lot of people outside of work. I told her I'd drive 45 minutes down to where she is if I had to but was brainstorming other coworkers who live closer with her because she's feels bad asking me to do that drive. \n\nI feel like there should absolutely be better ways to support people who don't have their own support systems through medical procedures.", "Awww thanks!!:):):) \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "Maybe I just thought of a business for myself \ud83d\udca1", "So I actually asked this question. Due to the fact that once my mother passes I don't have a person. As it's too inconvenient for most of my family to help me for anything.\n\nI was told I would basically have to find someone even if that means paying them to babysit me otherwise they would not do the procedure", "Yeah I'm in the US too. If you're not hospital administration, don't act like such an authority on policy but then not know anything about a valid yet probably not too uncommon scenario. Plus something like this hardly sounds like federal law so you're in the US that's really not important if you're not even saying what state.", "You would become a millionaire honestly", "There are actually home care business\u2019s that do this. It\u2019s expensive but exists. I don\u2019t know if insurance would cover\u2026", "In Australia they will sometimes admit you for the night following surgery/procedures if you need to be monitored and have no-one", "Funny how lazy people always bring down everyone's dreams and ideas."]}
