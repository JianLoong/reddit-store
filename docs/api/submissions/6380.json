We had been together from the age of 17, had married in our 20s and he passed at the age of 31. Our children were very young. The last five years I have missed him like crazy and have poured myself into focusing on my children, my hobbies and even furthering my career more. I have no interest in dating or finding a new partner. My sister and a couple of other family members have been trying to ~~push~~... I mean encourage me to find a new partner, to find a dad for my kids, to look for more love. I have zero interest. It's something I have discussed with my sister on repeat. She has told me she doesn't understand. Even as a teen I had zero dating interest. My husband was the exception. I loved him, I was best friends with him, we were compatible in every way and we found a relationship that worked for the two of us and gave us a life better than we had planned on. My interest in dating has not sparked now in my 30s and widowed. I have pleaded with my sister to understand, to know that I am living the life I want to live and that I am not some broken hearted shell who has paused my life.\n\nIt seemed as though she accepted it.\n\nShe announced her engagement months ago, sent invites for her February wedding in December and she and her fiance left a note that they would cover the cost of the hotel for me because they are aware I am now a single mom and that leaving my three kids with my ILs covers some expense, but not all. So I RSVPd yes. Then over Christmas my brother told me my sister has rounded up many single men to invite to the wedding and she has recruited some people to help her play matchmaker for me at her wedding. He said it was why she paid for the hotel for me and everything. I was not happy. Her friend she recruited to help confirmed it to me. She said my sister has been wanting to find me the perfect man and has planned it all. I was so done at this point that I called my sister, told her I knew what she was up to and I would no longer be attending her wedding and I was not going to trust her again.\n\nShe got so upset and told me I was overreacting. My parents also chimed in and told me the same. They said I could just ignore her plan and attend and support my sister. My sister keeps telling me I need to come and then she got mad saying she's trying to save me from myself.

Instead, this event that was meant to be fun and happy will have you on tenterhooks anticipating or dealing with guys hitting on you.\n\nThe bigger issue are your boundaries being trampled.  I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s imperative that she understands your views for her to back off.  She doesn\u2019t understand, OK.  But she must respect it. Thinking that what she thinks and wants is more important than what you think and want (the person who will actually be the one in any potential relationship) is highly disrespectful.  And controlling. She can control things in her life all she wants, but not in yours. It actually makes me wonder what she would be like in her marital relationship - this is not the sign of somebody who generally respects and supports others - it\u2019s somebody who thinks their wishes matter most, and that is not a good way to start a marriage. \n\nSorry for everything that you have has to go through.

You\u2019d be feeling like the laughing stock of the wedding and like the butt of everyone\u2019s joke. The poor lonely widow who needs help catching a man.
