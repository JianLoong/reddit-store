The most recent time was because my sis wanted to do a wine tasting while we were on a trip together. \n\nAt the winery, I found the first wine that I\u2019ve actually enthusiastically liked: a spicy wine infused with hot peppers.

Then one Friday night, I came home to Morgan and two of her friends drinking it. I confronted her about it, and she said that her friend had opened it without knowing it was mine. Morgan apparently realized the mistake but thought it would be ok because I\u2019ve \u201csaid that I don\u2019t like wine before.\u201d \n\n??? What makes you think that made it ok? Ive said that before, yes, but this is literally the only wine I\u2019ve ever enjoyed enough to buy a bottle of. I was saving it for a special occasion or maybe to share the next time my sister came to visit. But they drank most of it, and now there\u2019s barely a full glass left. \n\nI told her I wanted her to replace it, and she agreed. Well, a couple weeks later she said that she\u2019d gotten me another bottle, but it was just regular wine from the liquor store. \n\nI told her that she must have misunderstood: I don\u2019t want just any old bottle of regular wine. I want her to get me another bottle of the actual wine that she and her friends drank.\n\nHer eyes got really wide and she started complaining about how that winery is a three hour drive away, and that wasn\u2019t fair because it was her friend who opened it and not her.\n\nHonestly? I told her that I didn\u2019t really care. Morgan knew it was mine and let her friends drink it anyway. She could have told her friend that it was mine, put it away, and told me about it, and I would\u2019ve understood. But no, she let them go ahead and even poured herself a glass. She was still drinking it when I came home. \n\nSo yeah: I\u2019ve told her that her friend can replace it or she can. Don\u2019t really care how. I just want another bottle before the lease is up next year and I move out. \n\nMorgan is mad at me. She\u2019s been avoiding hanging out in our shared living room and won\u2019t speak to me at all now. Our third roommate thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable and wants me to just drop it and accept the regular wine bottle as a replacement, so Morgan will \u201cget back to her old self.\u201d \n\nThey\u2019re both making me feel really bad now, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m being too harsh so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685030734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rlphd/aita_for_wanting_my_roommate_to_replace_my/", "score": 6841, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Knowing that you have a special wine waiting adds something to look forward to even if you don't plan on drinking it anytime soon. Having that taken away because they decided you didn't want it was not cool. Then replacing it with a lesser wine is a slap. \n\nI hope she replaces it.

Who cares if she \"thought\" that you don't like wine so you wouldn't miss it?  Maybe it was the ONE wine you've had that you liked... or maybe it was a gift you've been saving to give to someone.

Even if they just let it rest, they\u2019ve still started oxidizing.", "I'm confused... You're talking about \"getting back at them\" and revenge. I simply seek restorative justice.\n\nI had a very similar situation to OP in college. Was roommate with my brother, him and his dipshit friends drank my bottle of nice (ketel one) vodka and tried giving me a bottle of shit vodka (Smirnoff) in exchange. I made his life hell til he got me what was mine. It's not about revenge, it's about making them take you seriously. These days, I'd probably just let it go, but back then, $30 was real money to me.  What actually worked was a threat to toss their cast iron in the dishwasher. But I clearly communicated what the issue was, not just passively did shit without telling him why I was angry.", "Because that's what you're replying to.", "No no, I mean dump as in down the drain, gone. Cuz it's oxidizing.\n\nOP could've decided to drink it that night (which they were probably forced to, that last half glass or whatever) or drink it the next day with a nice meal and a friend. That last ditch option was taken from them.", "OP lost wine. OP wants wine back. Roommate tried to compensate OP, but doesn't think a 6 hour wine trip is reasonable. How likely do you think roomate will be to go on that trip if OP pisses her off?", "I\u2019m replying to a comment. Not the original post", "special or not is irrelevant. how long it\u2019s good for is irrelevant. \n\ni like gin. i like my bombay sapphire and my empress. i drink them when i feel like it, neither is for any special occasion, and they\u2019re pretty shelf stable. \n\nif a roommate opened a bottle and drank even only a couple drinks worth, without asking permission, i\u2019d be livid. even if they replaced it. \n\nnot because it\u2019s fancy, unique, limited, gonna go bad, or because i\u2019m saving it for anything. but because they know it\u2019s mine.", "It was. But they weren\u2019t home, and also had let it sit for months so it seemed unlikely they were going to want to finish a bottle. \n\nI see your point to an extent. I think Morgan should have immedielty texted OP and let her know of the mistake, stated she\u2019d replace it (appropriately) and then figured it out.\n\nThe problem was the lack of communication.", "Your reply was to a comment about the 28-year-old in this story. You just changed your mind after I pointed out that they weren't partying. Or you didn't make it clear in your initial reply that you weren't talking about the 28-year-old in question even though that's what you were replying to.\n\nAnyway, this is tedious. You said something incorrect--so it goes.", "You are totally NTA - they went ahead and drank a hard to find wine that was yours because they wanted to.   \nJust a note, though - I also found an awesome white wine with peppers in it - it was kind of sweetly spicy and loved it. My cousin was visiting me at the time and also bought a bottle to take home with her. She saved it for two years until I visited her. We opened the bottle, all excited, and it had aged and grown immensely hotter over those two years. I like spicy but this was something else.   \nFor the bottle that they should buy you - don't wait two years to drink it!", "I had a roommate drink a bottle of very nice single malt scotch l got as a gift ,with some girls who followed him home from the bar . They mixed it with coke and gave me a bottle J&B as a replacement .The bodies were never found.", "NTA. I\u2019ve somehow managed to live with both a roommate and several partners, who do not understand this concept at ALL.\n\nI am not a huge sweets person, and I only like a few things. Both my ex\u2019s would eat ALL of my ice cream, or whatever little treat while I was at work. And then when I\u2019d be looking for it respond with- oh I\u2019ll grab you more tomorrow *shrugs* no no- I want that now, and now I can\u2019t have it. My old roommate would also do this whenever I got the non dairy like dipper ice creams- she\u2019d eat the entire damn box in one night. \n\nAll of them would basically blame me for \u201cknowing they have poor self control.\u201d\n\nSide note- spicy wine sounds delicious", "Other roommate needs the boat rocking classic post from JUSTNOMIL.", "Going to a winery is fun as hell, she could make a fun trip of it and grab OPs bottle as a side quest.  So dumb to pout and act like OP should just forgive the brat.", "thats classic", "Well, assuming OP is even in the same state as the winery, odds are probably not high. I'ma give you a long explanation with a TL;DR at the end because people seem to enjoy my explanations.\n\nFor each state, there are at least half a dozen distributors, which each store typically buys their product from. Some stores only buy from one distributor at a time (sometimes because reps are predatory), but the smart ones ask for full inventory lists and buy from multiple sources. Be aware, some reps only sell what makes them the most money. \n\nEach distributor has its own inventory list of wineries. Small production wineries may not have enough product to push wholesale, and therefore get ignored. For example, Lescombes is a winery in NM that makes chili-infused wines, for a price point of about $11 USD. \n\nTechnically, that's a fruit wine because of the chili, which is a different category than grape wine, even though it's made with grapes. Because of that, it has a novelty demand, rather than a fine wine demand. Any wine bar or restaurant will likely pass it up in favor of a more common varietal from that same producer, such as Cab Sauv or Pinot. Partly because that's what guests are more likely to order, but also because a restaurant, shop, and a rep can make much better margins on it. \n\nSo you're more likely to find it at a local liquor store or tourist shop, esp. because of the price point. But unless a shop has their inventory listed online, you'd either have to search high and low for it or call each store and ask. And unless you're in the industry, you can't just check to see distributor inventory. \n\nTL;DR- maybe? Depends on production/demand.", "OP is never getting the wine either way, so...", "Judge Judy", "Although you can\u2019t diss Casios", "I absolutely adore your edit. Hahahaha \n\nNTA, OP.", "To be fair, the moment she tasted it was the wrong wine the damage was already done. It was already opened, and they might at well drink it instead of just letting it go bad.\n\nBut yeah she should pay for a replacement. Also almost certainly the winery would ship them a bottle, or a wine store locally carries it.  She doesn't need to drive there to get it.", "I legit thought this was guerrilla marketing for some off beat product but apparently there's a whole category for this.  https://vinepair.com/articles/caliente-spicy-wines/", ">Why must every story have an uninvolved third party offering their verdict on things? \n\nIsn't that what we are doing? :)", "I bet that rug really tied the room together.", "Lmao touch\u00e9", "No. We\u2019re being asked for our opinion by OP. It\u2019s not clear weather OP asked their other roommate to weigh in, but I\u2019m guessing no.", "We have a winery here in CA that does a special reserved bottle that has notes of chili peppers in it. They also have a rose with jalape\u00f1o. They release them for the annual pepper festival and it\u2019s honestly good \ud83d\ude02. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d keep on my shelf but it\u2019s a fun once a year drink I like to have.", "Well that\u2019s just like your opinion man", "This is where calling the winery is the best option. They can tell her whether shipping is an option and the cost. They should also have an idea if any shops near her sell that bottle. She would still have to call the shops herself but at least can narrow it down to a handful of places rather than any store that can legally sell wine in her area.", "Absolutely. The shop will be able to tell OP the shipping price, too. \n\nSide note though, that wine I mentioned somewhere in this thread also seems bomb and might be worth tasting, as well."]}
