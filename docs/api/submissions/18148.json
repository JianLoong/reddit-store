Ive said that before, yes, but this is literally the only wine I\u2019ve ever enjoyed enough to buy a bottle of.

But they drank most of it, and now there\u2019s barely a full glass left. \n\nI told her I wanted her to replace it, and she agreed. Well, a couple weeks later she said that she\u2019d gotten me another bottle, but it was just regular wine from the liquor store. \n\nI told her that she must have misunderstood: I don\u2019t want just any old bottle of regular wine. I want her to get me another bottle of the actual wine that she and her friends drank.\n\nHer eyes got really wide and she started complaining about how that winery is a three hour drive away, and that wasn\u2019t fair because it was her friend who opened it and not her.\n\nHonestly? I told her that I didn\u2019t really care. Morgan knew it was mine and let her friends drink it anyway. She could have told her friend that it was mine, put it away, and told me about it, and I would\u2019ve understood. But no, she let them go ahead and even poured herself a glass. She was still drinking it when I came home. \n\nSo yeah: I\u2019ve told her that her friend can replace it or she can. Don\u2019t really care how. I just want another bottle before the lease is up next year and I move out. \n\nMorgan is mad at me. She\u2019s been avoiding hanging out in our shared living room and won\u2019t speak to me at all now. Our third roommate thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable and wants me to just drop it and accept the regular wine bottle as a replacement, so Morgan will \u201cget back to her old self.\u201d \n\nThey\u2019re both making me feel really bad now, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m being too harsh so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685030734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rlphd/aita_for_wanting_my_roommate_to_replace_my/", "score": 691, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is it an option to go to the winery together? Spend some nice time, do a wine tasting and buy a new bottle. She pays for the bottle and everything else you split.

The fact that she didn\u2019t stop her friends is also a red flag, that to me means she doesn\u2019t care too much. She should have taken note of the fact that while you don\u2019t drink a lot of wine, that probably means you\u2019re specific about the wine you do drink and likely would have told her she could have it if you really didn\u2019t want it. \n\nFriends have stored a few cases of alcohols for me b/c I moved abroad. There was a case that had select wines I told them they\u2019d like/could take and they STILL checked with me before taking any. \n\nAlso, I\u2019d check online and see if the winery delivers and if you\u2019re in the same state, it\u2019ll be easier/more likely too.

Morgan should be taking responsibility for any damage her friends do. Tell your other roomie no, a generic bottle of wine does not equal the wine that was taken and morgan needs to start adulting.", "NTA - looks like your roommate and her friends have a reason to go wine tasting.", "NTA I would be furious too. Knowing that you have a special wine waiting adds something to look forward to even if you don't plan on drinking it anytime soon. Having that taken away because they decided you didn't want it was not cool. Then replacing it with a lesser wine is a slap. \n\nI hope she replaces it. She could call them and ask if they will mail a bottle.", "NTA. Some AH get mad and lash out when they realize they have done something wrong.

Does the winery have a website she can order and deliver from? I mean, I understand wanting the exact thing replaced, and in a an ideal world that's what should happen.  6 hours there and back is a long way.......I don't think that's a reasonable expectation.

At 28 years old I would hope she is old enough to figure out how to replace a bottle of wine. Has she ever heard of the internet or a phone? I\u2019m sure the winery would ship a bottle of wine for a fee. \nIf she borrowed you LV heels & broke them, you\u2019d expect her to replace them with LV, not some \u201clookalikes\u201d from Target.

Even if it\u2019s in your section or your cabinet or whatever. Roommates make dumb decisions, usually in the form of using your stuff and thinking they can replace it before you notice.

If the place was an hour away I'd say go for it, 2 hours would be a stretch, and 3 hours is a bit ridiculous. That's the drive from Brussels to Paris. It's just a bottle of wine, OP didn't drive to the winery specifically to buy it, she was just on a trip to a winery and picked up a bottle she enjoyed. Take the money and move on, or plan another trip to the winery if OP enjoyed it that much.", "> Even if it means calling six bookstores and looking online.\n\nYes, that's absolutely reasonable. Expecting them to drive 6 hours to buy it is what I think is unreasonable, but yeah it would be totally reasonable for the roommate to call up the winery and ask where it's sold locally or if they can ship some. Or if there's a minimum number of bottles for a shipment (like 4), buy 4 bottles with at least two going to OP.", "An easy compromise here would be to go with the roommate out to the winery on a day trip to do a tasting.
