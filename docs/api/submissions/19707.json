Having an adult man home all day, eating our grocery, spiking our electricity bill and can't so much as throw out the trash.\n\nMy mother called me a horrible sister and when my dad heard, he said I would be cut off from any benefits in their passing... and everything placed in  my brother's name.

They have stated multiple times that his care when they are gone will not fall to the two younger kids.

They should set up a trust and have plans for him to go into a group home if that\u2019s what he needs.\n\nThreatening to cut you off from whatever puny inheritance they might conceivably leave you is laughable.

They are his parents, not you. They need to figure out how to do this without you. I mean hell, in another 10-15 years, are they going to expect you to take care of them AND him AND your three kids?
