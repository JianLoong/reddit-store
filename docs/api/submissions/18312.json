You\u2019re clearly dealing with a crazy person.\nNext time, drop your daughter off and wait around the corner.  Totally not fair to you and I get that, but sometimes it\u2019s worth it just to keep the peace when dealing with someone unstable.", "I do stay away, but youngest asked me to take her over there for her gift.\n\nI do what I need to do for the kids... Even if that means going to his house.", "We have been divorced for 10 years... Met fiance 4 years ago. So no affair.\n\nHe just doesn't like the fact that I moved on and that fiance has taken an active part in the kids life and they see him more of a father figure/someone they can count on than their own dad.\n\nHe blames fiance for the older  kids not talking to him", "Which you did, and he acted like a bratty child. Now I would make him drop it off and not make yet another trip for yourself.", "ok so hes just a jealous man. nta for sure then", "So he gets more chance to kick off? Nah, he can post the darn thing. \n\nNTA.", "NTA sounds like the only reason he\u2019s in contact with the youngest is to watch your actions. My guess is he\u2019s using her. I would recommend your daughter see a therapist to decide if contact is needed or for the therapist to help work through these types of incidents that are likely to continue.", "Reasonable question.", ">I do what I need to do for the kids... Even if that means going to his house.\n\nSpeaking as someone who had a non-present father.... what you do for the kids can absolutely include not doing things if the experience will be bad for them.\n\nI am saying this kindly because it sounds like you're genuinely trying to do the right thing. But a missed present (which is what happened anyway) isn't a great feeling but it fades quicker than the upset of seeing a parent behave this way. (I remember the times of visits and upsets far more than the many many no visits)\n\nKeeping it on a positive side, you can tell the kids that dad will bring over his present when he can - and let  him be responsible for that parenting act.\n\nEspecially if this is his usual behavior, your kids are just learning he's an emotionally manipulative person. They will remember that each time - HIS behavior, not yours. In that sense, don't blame yourself for their memories because it is the dad's blame.", "NTA he needs to put his child first. His pettiness just messed up relationship with his daughter. Who he supposedly loves.", "NTA, but stop going to his house. If your ex can\u2019t make the effort to see his kids or mail a gift at the very least, then he does not get to dictate that you drive to him. Unfortunately, you\u2019re forced to have a hard conversation with your child about your ex. You don\u2019t need to bad mouth him, but you do need to explain that you\u2019re not driving there anymore. He sees nothing wrong with cussing you out IN FRONT of your children.", "NTA- but is the contact really worth it? He sounds like he makes no effort other than to throw fits because you\u2019re with a new man. Four years- heck after a year it\u2019s considered abandonment in some states and can cost a neglectful parent their rights completely.", "NTA. Your ex is responsible for managing his relationship with your kids at this point. They are all in high school now, and while you need to still facilitate things like visits and contact per the order, and certainly should not be obstructionist about this relationship, you are not responsible for driving to pick up a gift. He could have dropped it off at your home or met your daughter after school one day to give it to her. It was nice of you to drive twenty minutes out of your way for this, and how awful for reacting how he did and not seeing her when you got there or giving her the gift then. Lesson learned the hard way. You now know the boundary you need to put in place to protect yourself and also the kids from a scene like this.", "Guess we all know why he is the ex.", "Look, I\u2019m betting he didn\u2019t even have a gift.  \n\nHe remembered it was her birthday, and didn\u2019t want to be seen as a dead beat, but probably figured you wouldn\u2019t drive the 45 minutes to get it. \n\nSo when you agreed to stop by, he was screwed. So he picked a fight -and it would have been over *anything* so he could tell her *thats* why she\u2019s not getting the gift. \n\nAnd now? He\u2019s putting it on YOU so he can tell his daughter YOU are why she doesn\u2019t have his gift (and I\u2019m doubting he even has anything still).", "NTA!  Why didn't he bring the gift when he came outside?  He didn't have a gift, he was up to no good, so that's why he acted an ass.", "NTA.. you are not your ex's babysitter.  He's a  AH and a grownup", " Nta. Sadly, some ppl never grow up", "You say \"without slamming her father\" but it's important that she knows his behaviour is highly inappropriate (at best) and not only should she not have to put up with it from her father but that she should never have to put up with it from any future partner. There's ways of putting things, but his behaviour shouldn't be glossed over.", "Did she actually see the gift? Deadbeat doesn't see or really talk to his kids. Unless the gift was seen and he took it back inside, I'm betting there was no gift. He needed a reason to blame OP for him not giving her one, and the loser found one.", "NTA.  Man was a jacka$$.  Here's hoping the next four years pass quickly so you no longer have to put up with him.", "NTA. Take him to court and get full custody. Ur kids don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this. It\u2019s fucking bullshit.  I would insulate ur daughter from him 100%. Being a teenage girl is hard enough. It\u2019s extra hard when u feel u don\u2019t have or deserve the love or attention of ur father. When he\u2019s mad at u, he punishes his kid for it. It\u2019s got to stop. He witholds his affections to punish her in order to make u hurt. Unacceptable. Uve got to send a clear message that this will no longer stand. Document this behavior and get full custody", "NTA. My mom and bio dad split when I was 9 months old. My mother moved back to where she grew up which was 2,000 miles away. Neither could afford us to see him every year so I didn\u2019t meet him until I was almost 11 and had lived with my mother\u2019s boyfriend for 10 years. He\u2019s sho I called dad. Said it right to my bio dad then when my dad met us in July, I called him dad in front of my bio dad. While I am sure that was painful, my bio dad never said a negative word about him. Not even by accident. There\u2019s no call for someone to act like your ex in front of kids. He should have sucked it up and gave her the present. It sounds like it was some kind of bribe anyway since he doesn\u2019t actually take his allowed parenting time. Definitely NTA. Your ex can drive the 45 mins. Gas isn\u2019t cheap and while I am sure you can afford to take 2 vehicles, it\u2019s an unnecessary waste. And since your daughter was ok with it, your ex has zero say!"]}
