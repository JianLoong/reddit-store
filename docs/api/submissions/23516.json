My ex and I co parent a wonderful 9 year old daughter. We've been separated since my daughter was 3 but we have always maintained 50% physical custody and co-parented effectively. I'm dad.\n\nWell my daughter's body is changing. And she is developing little \"buds\" that are barely even there or noticeable. My daughter's mom freaked out and bought her about 10 bras and told her she has to wear them at all times when not at home.\n\nAt first I was on board because this is clearly mom territory and I didn't want to step on her toes. But the last few weeks it's been made clear that my daughter hates wearing these bras (she has sensory issues when it comes to clothes). So I haven't been forcing her to wear them when she is with me.\n\nHer mom found out and we had a little argument about it. I asked her why it was so important- if it was a development thing or a modesty thing since I'm pretty ignorant in this subject. She told me it is a modesty thing and that she needs to wear them because \"men are perverts\".\n\nOur daughter is 9 years old! I got a bit mad because I don't feel like my 9 year old daughter should have to wear something that is uncomfortable because someone may look at her wrong. I feel like it's the same concept as forcing women to wear veils so men aren't tempted. And it's just wrong.\n\nThis is the second puberty related argument we've had. When I took our daughter to her last doctor's appointment the doctor told us that she was starting puberty and we need to start having those talks with her. I asked her mom to talk to her about the changes that would be happening to her body but she refused saying she was too young and that it would scare her. But the doctor said it's possible for her to have her first period any time between now and when she is 11.\n\nSo I did research, sat her down and talked to her about this stuff and we made a plan for what to do when it happens- especially if it is at school. Her mom was livid and said I had no business talking to her about those things as I'm dad and not mom.\n\nMom thinks I am a major asshole for these things. But I think I'm just doing what has to be done so my daughter isn't made uncomfortable or blindsided by the changes she will be experiencing.\n\nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1690762632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15e10pe/aitah_for_not_forcing_my_9_year_old_daughter_to/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's a very sad reality. I do understand the mom's fear, but that's not the right way to approach the body changes and body autonomy. \n\nYou're doing right.", "NTA, you\u2019re doing everything you can as a dad to raise your child. You may not have personal experiences with periods, but you can still talk to her about it. What I don\u2019t understand is why her mom, of all people, thinks she\u2019s the only one who has to teach her these things.", "NTA if you don\u2019t mind a suggestion - my mom started me off with camisoles. Something to add an extra layer without being restrictive. I don\u2019t think your wife is trying to make a bad choice here, but she is failing to adapt to your daughter\u2019s actual needs and is just enforcing what she thinks \u201cshould\u201d work.", "NTA. She has a lifetime of body shaming to deal with, she doesn't need it at 9 years old.", "100% NTA!!! \n\nIt sounds like you're being an awesome dad and your ex is delusional.\n\nAn actual medical professional told you that your baby girl could literally start her first period at any moment, and ex still won't talk to her about it. Because... modesty? Because it won't happen if she's just not prepared? While our 6-year-old son doesn't \"understand,\" he knows that girls bleed every now and then, and it's normal. \n\nThe bra thing is just dumb. Obviously, the problem is that there are always going to be creepy guys who are inappropriate. Instead of teaching your daughter that it's her responsibility to cover her \"buds\" at 9 years old, maybe you could teach that it's okay to be comfortable and possibly enroll her in a self-defense class? That's not a bad idea for any human these days, no matter their age. Especially for a young girl. It wouldn't hurt for her to have the ability to break someone's fingers (or arm) for touching her inappropriately. \n\nIt's our job as parents to prepare our children for the world. Not to hide them from it.\n\nYou're doing great, and please, for your daughter's sake, keep having these uncomfortable/embarrassing conversations to the point that they're not uncomfortable/embarrassing anymore. You're going to be the one she comes to for help and advice. \n\nDon't judge or shame her. If you don't know the answer, Google it together and take her to the doctor if you can't find an answer or it doesn't make sense to you. You might want to have the sex talk now as she's going to start her period soon (whether ex likes it or not). \n\nShe might only be 9, but she understands. THAT I can guarantee.\n\nKeep at it, dad, you're amazing!", "NTA\n\n\nWoman here. \n\nThe mom is right, a lot of us received unwanted attention from men before turning 10. Your daughter being 9 will not stop perverts from looking at her.  \n\nThat said, neither will wearing a bra. \n\nBut thats the only part where she has a point. \n\nYou absolutely should be having puberty related conversations with your daughter, you're as much of a parent as your ex is. My dad had those convos with me just as much as my mom, and now at almost 40, looking back I really appreciate that he was comfortable to talk about puberty, buying me sanitary pads, that he knew what having a period meant for my wellbeing, etc. \n\nWell done to you for talking to her like you did, and as for your ex... I just don't get why she doesn't want to talk to your 9yo about puberty. Nothing worse than being unprepared for the appearing out of nowhere hips, breasts, vaginal discharge etc. \n\n>I don't feel like my 9 year old daughter should have to wear something that is uncomfortable because someone may look at her wrong. \n\nRight on the money, she shouldn't be punished for other people's sick thoughts or made to feel like she's somehow to blame.\n\nYou're a good dad and you're doing the right thing by allowing your daughter a choice, especially if she has sensory issues. \n\nYour ex wife needs to accept that have *exactly* the same rights as she does, that includes deciding about what your child wears, what she learns about, etc.", "50% custody and co-parent mom expects the universe to align so that puberty-related talks and events only happen on her watch? Your ex sounds a bit wobbly in the head. Sure, these are traditionally female-female conversations and issues, but that traditional family unit no longer exists for you, so everybody needs to adapt and do their best.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I had just turned 10 when I had my first period. I freaked because my underpants were all bloody and I was in the bathroom try to clean them. Luckily this happened at home. I had only a minor talk about periods at school\u2014this was in 1970.  I would have benefited from more in depth talks.\nShe is not too young to get her period now, my friend\u2019s granddaughter started hers at 8. As far as wearing a bra I developed early and had to wear one, my sister didn\u2019t really need to wear one till older.  I don\u2019t see anything wrong with not wearing one yet if she is not that developed but she may wish to a camisole or undershirt under some of her tops if needed.", "NTA!!! As a mom I commend you!!! You know what is more terrifying than talking about a period? Having a 9 yo girl start bleeding and not have a clue why there is blood everywhere!!! THAT is terrifying and can leave a horrible impression. The American Girl book \u201cThe Care and Keeping of You\u201d is a WONDERFUL book! There is book 1 and 2. I also suggest you get some organic cotton pads (that\u2019s a personal preference on my end bc I hate the texture of the big name brands.) for her to keep in her back pack (even just one or two) in case she starts when she\u2019s out. She will be so thankful to have them when she starts and has access to them. As for the bras\u2026my kiddo (sensory issues) prefers sports bras. I let her try on different kinds. Until she found the style she likes. They don\u2019t feel so \u201cbra\u201d.", "NTA", "NTA - while I think this is largely way above AITA's pay grade, you're in no way the AH for how you feel.  Plenty of women choose not to wear bras, and while there shouldn't be anything wrong with that choice, society (not just men) in general are perverted and love to judge women and shame them over their clothing choices.  Your wife's reaction kind of proves that point.  So, while I think your wife wants to protect your daughter, she's going about it in a way that is likely causing your daughter unnecessary shame and stress.\n\nI think the tougher issue is how do you support your daughter without making this into a parental squabble that your daughter gets caught in the middle of? I don't have a clear answer for that, but I suggest just keeping telling your daughter you love her and will support her choices.  I think that is the best thing you can do.", "NTA. You are doing what you can to help and understand your daughter. I'm someone with sensory issues and am unable to wear any kinds of bras for long periods of time. Thing is she is only nine and when I was this age nearly no one wore bras this young. Plus perverts will still be there no mather what. I think she can wait a little and look for more comfortable alternatives. Plus props to you for talking about period, no one (even my mom) did this with me and let me tell you it's freaking scary when you don't know what's going on especially if it happens outside of the house. The thing that you did a research about this topic for your daughter is amazing and showing how good as a father you are.", "NTA asshole but as a woman I am telling you right now I was cat called wayyyyy more between the ages of 12-16 by older men than any other time in my life. Your wife may recall something similar and is trying to protect your daughter from experiencing such things.", "NTA as a dad.\n\nYour child is 9 and starting puberty. My mother slowly introduced me to the idea of periods over months and explained what they were to me multiple times and I STILL freaked when I first got mine, because it's terrifying. \n\nYour ex-wife is being a horrible mother right now. It's her job as a mother to prepare her for these changes and she's clearly failing at it. She's 9 and her body is beginning to go through these changes. There is NO point in telling her all this after she's experienced it. Good on you for doing what she didn't. I'm sure your daughter will remember it and thank you.\n\nAlso, some advice, I hate bra's to, and 9 should be fine to let it slide, but when they really start growing in, she's going to need them and have to get used to wearing them or it could cause her some problems depending on how big they grow to be. So your ex-wife may have had a similar experience and is why she's so dead set on this.", "NTA, but your wife isn\u2019t 100% wrong about the bra. \n\nThere are a LOT of freaks out there and if one of them commented on your daughters figure OR approached her because of it that\u2019s potentially worse than the discomfort. \n\nI\u2019m not advocating your daughter wear the bra, but I think there needs to be a more nuanced conversation about it.", "NTA - Mom's rules are to wear the bra \"when not at home\". Your house is one of your daughter's homes, mom's rule doesn't require a bra.\n\nThe deeper issue is mom's attitude that all men are perverts. And she whats to teach her daughter that you are a pervert and should be treated as such.", "NTA. If your daughter's mother bought her the bras with filling I definitely understand the daughter being uncomfortable with it, I used to be too.\n\nI recommend buying her slip on bras, which are incredibly comfortable and fit for her age.\n\nIt's great that you had the period talk with your daughter, she needs to know those things to avoid bad surprises, and for her own health.\n\nYour daughter's mother seems to have a problem with exposing your daughter to the real world. She seems to be overprotective in a way that doesn't include the child or the child's actual feelings.", "NTA in my experience a bra usially 'defines' boobs more, im not sure what bras youre talking about, but to me this would if anything draw more attention\n\nRegardless, if your daughter is not comfortable wearing a bra, and theres no medical reason to support pushing her to do so, leave her be and tell mum to back off. This would be a hard line for me\n\nAlso, coming from a girl whos dad also had the talk with her cos mum thought i was too young, (wore a bra from 8 and periods started just after my 9th bday) keep doing what you need to for your daughter. She will worship the ground you walk on", "As a mom with a child with sensory processing disorder, I\u2019m  used to hearing certain fabrics and most tags are too itching. This is a legitimate concern for kids and should be accommodated. \n\nYour daughter may have two things going on\n\n1. She does not want to wear a bra at all and at 9 this sounds appropriate \n\n2. When the time comes when she wants to wear one, they have ones specifically designed for girl and women with sensory processing disorders, here is one: https://bleuetgirl.com/pages/sensory-aware-apparel\n\nYour ex sounds like she doesn\u2019t understand, believe and/or care how much tactile things can effect someone with a sensory processing disorders, which is awful but also makes her TA.\n\nYou, on the other hand, sound like a rational, intelligent and caring parent and NTA.", "Honestly, I think girls and women shouldnt need to wear bras if they don't want to. Guys don't have to so \ud83e\udd37 It should be solely to feel more comfortable and secure.", "NTA\n\nYou're being her dad in the best way possible. Hopefully, her mom will soon understand that her daughter is growing up and she needs to stop trying to ignore that. \n\nAlso, maybe try just an undershirt or camisole. Before transitioning, my son had a similar issue and we ended up finding an undershirt that had no tag, wasn't too tight or too loose, and did the same as a bra without strangling him (his words).", "NTA, even as a man we understand when something is uncomfortable. we shouldn't force our children to undergo uncomfortable feelings that we ourselves don't want to be subjected to. This feels like something that you could ease your daughter into overtime.", "NTA I was in the 3rd grade when it happened and I was horrified. This was with me being aware of it before hand. I was wearing a skirt and the teacher thought I injured myself, so she made the two boys sitting next to me clean it up while she took me to the nurse. I was so upset they had to send me home that day. Ruined a brand new plaid skirt too. \n\nGirls need to know about this sort of thing because most young girls who get their period before being told about it think their dying. Blood is scary and a kid's mind almost always goes to the worst possible thing.\n\nYou are a wonderful father for having this conversation with her and im sure your daughter will truly appreciate it when shes older. You are trying your best to do right by your kid and thats what a wonderful father does. Keep it up! \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. This world needs more loving and nurturing fathers who are invested in their children's lives and actually want them to be happy and healthy.  Are these uncomfortable subjects for a father and daughter?  Yes.  Do these conversations need to take place?  Yes.  Keep doing what you are doing.  If mom won't help then at least your daughter knows she has you in her corner.  Good job.", "NTA. Your daughter deserves to feel comfortable.

You are doing a great job in preparing your daughter for what\u2019s coming her way in puberty. Given the 50/50 custody, she could easily be at your home when it first happens - by being so open, she won\u2019t be nearly as scared. \n\nAs for the bra, you are teaching her autonomy: it\u2019s her choice what she wears. At some point, she may very well be more comfortable wearing one, though, for support purposes. Because of that, I highly suggest checking out the various bras/bralettes sold by MeUndies. I have serious sensory struggles with clothes and find their fabric and stitching to be so soft and comfortable. And my SIL swears by the \u201cfirst time\u201d bras by BleuetGirl that she bought for my niece - SIL is pretty petite and ended up buying a couple for herself!", "NTA. You sound like a good parent", "I got my period at 11. Luckily I was at home. I didn't really have a period talk prior to that. I hit puberty very early and very quickly. Good on you, Dad.

Your daughter will learn to trust you and know you have her back.", "NTA my daughter is almost 18 and still doesn\u2019t wear a bra. She prefers crop tops and wears them every day. Perhaps that\u2019s an option for your daughter rather than a traditional bra.", "NTA", "Well Dad..I had similar issues co parenting...you'll never win. Just do what you think is right. Different rules for different houses. You sound a little more rational than your ex", "NTA\n\nYou are doing great! Especially with the period prep stuff! Trust me when I say, it's far more scary being 11 years old and getting your period at school and being in agony and having nothing prepared or really any knowledge of what's happening. My mum felt so bad because she thought I would be older so hadn't really prepared me for it, but she made sure my sisters were much better prepared.\n\nAs for the bra situation, I agree with you about not forcing her to wear something uncomfortable for the sake of the male gaze (or in this case preventing it). If it's such an issue with your daughters mum, there's soft, seam-free crop top things you can buy that are infinitely more comfortable than actual bra's and they could be a good compromise.", "NTA.\n\n>Her mom was livid and said I had no business talking to her about those things as I'm dad and not mom.\n\nYou are as much her parent as her mother is - and it seems you are the only one looking out for her, whilst her mother buries her head in the sand and pretends nothing is happening, whilst simultaneously giving her the idea that it is her \"fault\" if men look at her, and \"she needs to be modest\".  These are poor lessons for any girl child - its teaching her to be ashamed of who she is.\n\nIf your ex pulls this argument out again, remind her you are 50% a parent - same as her.\n\nedit - clarity", "NTA bras are horribly uncomfortable.

My niece had her first period the summer before 4th grade, way before anyone expected her to. It was scary, traumatic, and embarrassing for her.

If dad can talk about periods and boobs it must not be weird and embarrassing. She\u2019s free of some of puberty related shame most young women experience.", "Look into sports bras. She's reaching a point where her breasts may be uncomfortable and especially noticeable if she is active. A sports bra is a good starter option that can be pulled over so doesn't have to have hooks or bands that needs to be adjusted. Many also have printed tags so a normal tag won't cause sensory issues. There are some great books I really like The Care and Keeping of You from the American Girls collection. If she sees a therapist or a support team for her sensory issues it's another great thing to preplan for. Sometimes kids with sensory issues have a really rough go with puberty because they don't understand why they need to do more hygiene wise which can cause social issues.", "NTA.

So when it was my *'time to bloom'* we were both had no idea what to do. To his credit- he'd asked a friend of his (a mom to 2 girls), who I was somewhat close to at the time, to try and answer some of the general questions we were both too embarrassed to ask. \n\n**[This isn't a rant to his faults, single dads can only do so much but there's a lot of 'feminine' things I'm not really prepared for]**\n\nYour daughter seems to be an early bloomer, and depending on how quickly she develops, maybe starting off bra-wearing sooner isn't a bad thing.

Kids go through puberty when their bodies are ready for it, not when we as parents are ready for it. And conversations about puberty have to be shame free! If your daughter is self conscious about her chest then she could wear a crop top or whatever, but why is the comfort of her mother or other people in public more important than your daughter\u2019s comfort?

And until she's developed more fully, they aren't necessary, but it's good to get used to them. If she ends up with larger breasts, NOT wearing a bra can be painful, though there are women who don't wear one regardless. As a comprise, have either of you tried different styles/materials of bras?

I like that kind for sleeping now when I\u2019m getting close to my period and my boobs are sore. \n\nBut also don\u2019t underestimate disgusting men.

Yes, moms should have first right of refusal to have those kind of conversations with a daughter...but if she isn't up to the task, then it's up to dad to have them.\n\nRegarding the bras, it sounds like OP is more willing to respect the daughter's bodily autonomy than the mother. Honestly, the daughter will probably end up far more well adjusted and confident about her own body if given the choice to dress how she wants and not develop a conscience about how other people react to it...which will lead to being better able to cope with and call out 'perverts' than being taught not wearing a bra makes her at fault for a perv being pervy...instead of acknowledging the perv for being what he is.", "NTA- perhaps bring your daughter shopping for a new bra.

While I'm generally of the opinion bras are a choice, young ages are a bit different. For starters, other kids tend to notice when you're big enough to wear one but aren't, and it's not just the boys. Girls can be mean. For me, by the time I was 12, no bra was not an option cause things like gym class actually were uncomfortable without one. Make sure you know why she won't wear one and explore different styles to actually find one comfortable to her, too, cause something tells me mom isn't. There's also a lot of fun options to explore, like fancy braletts and supportive tanks used for layering.

My ex and I co parent a wonderful 9 year old daughter. We've been separated since my daughter was 3 but we have always maintained 50% physical custody and co-parented effectively. I'm dad.\n\nWell my daughter's body is changing. And she is developing little \"buds\" that are barely even there or noticeable. My daughter's mom freaked out and bought her about 10 bras and told her she has to wear them at all times when not at home.\n\nAt first I was on board because this is clearly mom territory and I didn't want to step on her toes. But the last few weeks it's been made clear that my daughter hates wearing these bras (she has sensory issues when it comes to clothes). So I haven't been forcing her to wear them when she is with me.\n\nHer mom found out and we had a little argument about it. I asked her why it was so important- if it was a development thing or a modesty thing since I'm pretty ignorant in this subject. She told me it is a modesty thing and that she needs to wear them because \"men are perverts\".\n\nOur daughter is 9 years old! I got a bit mad because I don't feel like my 9 year old daughter should have to wear something that is uncomfortable because someone may look at her wrong. I feel like it's the same concept as forcing women to wear veils so men aren't tempted. And it's just wrong.\n\nThis is the second puberty related argument we've had. When I took our daughter to her last doctor's appointment the doctor told us that she was starting puberty and we need to start having those talks with her. I asked her mom to talk to her about the changes that would be happening to her body but she refused saying she was too young and that it would scare her. But the doctor said it's possible for her to have her first period any time between now and when she is 11.\n\nSo I did research, sat her down and talked to her about this stuff and we made a plan for what to do when it happens- especially if it is at school. Her mom was livid and said I had no business talking to her about those things as I'm dad and not mom.\n\nMom thinks I am a major asshole for these things. But I think I'm just doing what has to be done so my daughter isn't made uncomfortable or blindsided by the changes she will be experiencing.\n\nAITAH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How do you think you're going to feel if your 10 year old calls you up from school or is screaming from the bathroom because there's blood between her legs and she thinks she's dying? Not telling her about it isn't going to make it not happen. Random blood between her legs is going to scare her a whole lot more than a rational discussion about it.

She can't be recognizing that her daughter is going through puberty and forcing 'women' products on her like bras that she doesn't like without following through on everything else that happens to women. There needs to be a handful of discussions that need to be had and frankly, your ex is in denial if she's buying her bras to cover baby booby bumps but won't explain periods to her. The fact she has baby boobies is proof that her menses is going to start SOON. Can't have one without the other. Which means one of you (probably you) are also going to have to have a sex ed talk with her. Talk about consent. Talk about what falls under the sex umbrella (you'd be flabbergasted at how many teenagers think oral sex isn't sex).

I developed early and needed a bra by 9. I hated them and I refused to wear them. Long story short I was in 4th grade and it took being relentlessly teased by 6th grade girls about my chest, in order for me to start wearing my bras. So my defiance was short lived. I have 3 daughters. One of which also has sensory issues like your daughter. We're years into puberty and she still won't wear bras HOWEVER, we have solutions that work her her! She uses other methods. We buy specific tank tops (we have tried MANY, because again- sensory issues) and she wears these tanks under thick fabric t shirts. This combined, gives her enough concealment and comfort. For a long time she would pick out fun t shirts at places like Walmart in the boy section because they often are made out of that thicker fabric. The older she gets the more creative she gets with improvising. I've re ordered her the same tanks more than once on Amazon and you can buy cheap plain girl tanks at Walmart on those little stand alone shelves for like 2.98. I recommend trying this out. You're not an asshole. You're a daddy navigating life with a little girl. My poor dad had to raise me, and my sister,  on his own. So the whole bra fiasco was so uncomfortable with him. But by the time my little sis needed a bra he delegated the task of talking to her to me. If you see this, please let me know if these ideas work for her? Sensory issues are no joke and the feel of clothing goes sooo beyond throwing a tantrum because you don't feel like wearing something. My daughter is 14 now. And it's still a struggle.

I got bullied a lot. Comments made by adults...\n\nI'd much rather have someone tell me all this stuff in advance. As it was I didn't get sex ed until 5th grade. A couple years after I had already begun. I understand moms worry and I agree with it in parts. The most confusing part for me was being treated or looked at like a woman when I was still a child, and not understanding why I was made fun of so much by boys and girls my own age for something I couldn't control. \n\nIt's tough for sure. If she's still small then I don't see there being a reason to while at home. But for her own social navigation she may want to learn how to wear one. Especially if she gets bigger.

Just like girls have to use period products, all girls will have to use bras. And many of them are uncomfortable! No 2 bras fit the same, every brand, cut, and type is completely different and feels very different. Rather than abandoning the whole bra issue, you MUST get to the bottom of why she doesn't like it and go from there. \n\nWhat type of bra was she bought? Was it a trainer bra (basically a cotton garment in the shape of a bra that looks like a sports bra)? Or did it look like some variation of a regular bra (where there's two cups and a strap in the back you do and undo)? If the latter, was it padded? If  she's just starting to fill out, a trainer bra or sports bra should be more then enough and to most people is much more comfortable. But the size could be off, so ask if its too tight or too lose. \n\nIf its a regular looking bra, then the cup size or the band size may be off, the tag could be super itchy and have to be ripped out or cut off, she might need the straps readjusted because they pull down to hard or are so loose they fall off, the cut of the cups might feel weird, the clasp could be irritating or she doesn't like the movement of opening from the back (in which case you can find front opening ones), or the material could be bad (stay away from lacy or any rough material, it should be a smooth fabric to help her start out). As mentioned previously, a trainer or sports bra should be more than enough, and it should provide enough nipple coverage for at least a year. - And no this isn't just for show, there are important biological reasons for wearing bras, particularly as her chest grows.\n\nIts important to get used to them, because you'll need them later in life (unless she stays at like an A cup, but a vast majority of women need bras all the time). Starting then is very helpful, especially since if she's going to have a larger chest, it can start filling in at any time. I went from training bras around her age to real bras in late elementary school at like a B or C cup and by late middle school/early high school I was in D and DD cup bras. At bigger sizes, bras become really really important because  if you don't wear them it can cause back pain, you can't participate well in sports or gym class (or anything involving running), and if you never wear bras at all, your chest will start to pull downwards and they won't stay firmly up (which further contributes to the back pain).\n\nAnother pro tip for later down the road, if your daughter gets into a C, D, or DD cup bra, a secret hack for playing sports/doing gym/running is wearing BOTH a regular bra AND a sports bra over it (the first effectively supports your breasts while the second pulls them tightly to your chest - so they dont bounce up and down when you run, which is a major inconvenience that increases as cup size increases). I used this trick for girls basketball in middle school and varsity tennis in high school, and let me tell you it was a LIFE SAVER.", "NTA\n\nSeems like mom is super old school. \n\nI will not be forcing bras or letting my child enter her teens without a proper chat about what\u2019s going to happen to her body.", "NTA.

Wired bras are known to stunt growth. They're also incredibly uncomfortable and definitely unnecessary for a young girl.\n\n\\- If she ever asks for underwire later in life but she's still too young, ask her about trying crossed bras. They can reduce shoulder pressure and make the experience a bit more comfortable.\n\n\\- I'd also just research bra health for teenagers in general.\n\n\\- For now you should be fine getting these thin crop vest type tops to appease the mother, they come in multi packs in kids aisles (if you're English, places like ASDA will have them) and the packs can hold like 6. They're hardly noticeable but if she does have sensory problems there are brands out there that make sensory processable clothing.

And there is no territory when it comes to which parent should do which part of parenting, she'll grow up to be a better, stronger woman because you have her back. Puberty is a part of life, and a part of your life too because you are her parent who loves her.  \n   Pretending women having periods is a thing only women know about and a shameful secret is weird and harmful. Half the planet has to deal with it at some point and everyone on the planet should know it is a normal thing.", "Once you know what her flow is like you can try other sensory friendly options like period underwear (it has a cloth pad built in!!! Thinx are a good brand) or cloth pads that work like normal pads but are made from very soft material. You are an awesome dad BTW!", "You set up a \u201ccode word\u201d? That\u2019s awesome. Wish we had use em growing up\u2026.", "A lot of sports bras, even for young girls, are seamless now. I don\u2019t necessarily think she needs to wear a bra all the time, but kids run around a lot and soon she may feel more comfortable with support.", "It's similar for me, if something is not completely smooth I cannot wear it and I know from experience how hard it is to get for example a bra that does not cause any form of discomfort or irritation.", "I think you are completely NTA. But it might be worthwhile to start researching types of bras she can wear. This will likely become an issue eventually, so it can\u2019t hurt to be prepared. There are some lounge bra styles that are seemless", "Seamless bras for the win! When my daughter was this age, it was camisoles, bralettes, and those smooth seamless bras. She grew out of that issue but wanting a little extra support with no hooks, seams, wires or discomfort is perfectly normal and understandable.", "Yeah honestly wasn't the teacher's best idea to make them clean it up, I was horrified lol. Luckily while it can be very scary the first time it happens, young girls can get over it fairly easily with time and experience, thank goodness. It wont be as scary just more of an inconvenience (and embarrassing for some teenage girls) as she gets older. \n\nYour best bet is to just treat it like you would puberty. Its a natural body's reaction and as long as you have a plan there isnt a need to worry. Kids can pick up on our own anxiety fairly easily. Just make sure to keep a heating pad or hot water bottle at home! It helps with the pain :)", "Here's an example:\nWould you walk down the street in the ghetto naked at 1:00am?\n\nWhy not?\nBecause walking around naked in a high crime area is not smart or safe. Is it your responsibility to keep the perves from attacking you? Of course not. But you take steps to stay safe. It's the same thing. \n\nNow,  here's another scenario. Go out and run errands with a bra on. Some men might glance at your breasts. \n\nThen go out without a bra, you'll notice MORE looks, longer looks, and creepier looks. But... you're a grown woman who can get out of situations. A nine year old child is easier to prey on. So why condone behavior that increases her risk?", "It reduces the attention from the creeps.\n\nWhy change her habits? To teach her NOW about ways to make herself safer and control what she can.\n\nWe can't control other people, but we can take steps to protect our children", "I'm so happy my mom was never shy about period... I don't remember learning about it. It was always a reality to me that it would happen at some point when I grew up.\n\nI can't comprehend keep something SO fundamental a secret!", "Or just a camisole under her shirt. I have sensory issues and bras are horrible. Camis don\u2019t bind.", "Why does she *need* to wear a bra?  If she is uncomfortable or just doesn\u2019t want to wear one, she doesn\u2019t have to. Period. End of story. \n\nUnless there is a law somewhere that says women need to wear bras.", "I guess I just wasn't ready for it. And her mom certainly wasn't. She's still our little girl!\n\nBut these changes don't give a damn if we are ready or not.", "Better nutrition leads to earlier periods. It was perfectly normal for girls to have their first period at 10 when I was a kid, and I'm 46 now. Please stop scaremongering about \"hormones\" and \"chemicals.\"", "I'm sorry to ask... But what do you do with the heating pad or hot water bottle? \n\nI've never heard of that.", "I just can't imagine someone saying \"Damn look at that little girl. Oh she's wearing a bra. Nevermind!\". Creeps don't care. \n\nBut I can imagine my daughter believing that it is somehow her fault that people look at her inappropriately. Or that it's her responsibility to police the inappropriate gaze of men and not their responsibility.\n\nAnd did you really compare a 9 year old little girl who doesn't even really have breasts yet not wearing a bra to someone walking down the street naked at 1:00 am? That analogy is so terrible it actually makes me angry.", "I really don\u2019t think teaching your daughter that it\u2019s her responsibility to prevent creepy men from behaving inappropriately counts as \u201cprotecting\u201d her.\n\nI\u2019m also pretty sure that predatory dudes are not going to determine whether how they behave based on whether a girl is wearing a bra or not. Women could wear ankle length dresses and turtlenecks and still get harassed or assaulted.\n\nThere are lots of important things to teach your children about how to stay safe, but \u2018avoid provoking men by dressing normally\u2019 is not one of them. FFS, plenty of adult women with smaller boobs don\u2019t wear bras either.", "I wore camis and sports bras when I was 10 and growing breasts. I eventually shifted to wireless and wired bras in middle school.", "Bras are terrible. Just get her some undershirts.", "I wore them growing up and they were favored over bras for sure", "I need to wear a bra because otherwise my boobs sweat so heavily that it's uncomfortable. Additionally, once they sweat that much, they rub off the skin to the point that I had open sores at one time for refusing to wear a bra. There's no reason to wear one for modesty's sake unless you personally want to. But there are definitely reasons to need to wear one.", "NTA\n\nIf it helps any, my daughter (almost 12) started budding at 8, and she didn\u2019t start her period for about 2 years. It could very likely be 2-4 years before she starts her period. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no real way to pinpoint how quickly after the start of puberty the first period occurs. The best I can do is tell you that you did right by her, and cross my fingers her body holds off until your daughter is more emotionally mature and can handle the flood of hormones. You\u2019re doing great, Dad. Keep up the good work", "Lol. No they don\u2019t. Life goes on. But I can tell you that you\u2019ve done her a huge favor by letting her know. I know what it\u2019s like for girls who didn\u2019t know freak out bc what the hell is happening?!?!?! They are terrified over something that they shouldn\u2019t be. But once again. Check out the book. Read it first if you are concerned. It talks about being healthy, eating healthy foods, bullying, puberty, and all.", "A hot water bottle is usually a rubber container or ice pack looking item that can be filled with very hot water so you can have something water to place on your stomach to ease cramping and a heating pad is similar to a very small heated blabket used for the same thing. I can link a hot water bottle from amazon to help out! Its the benefit of a hot bath without actually having to get in a tub.

I'm 33 and love my stuffed turtle", "Agree to disagree.", "And you are wearing one because you are uncomfortable if you don\u2019t. That\u2019s a valid reason. \n\nWhat I was trying to say was that she doesn\u2019t need to wear one just because mom says so. Bodily autonomy and all that.", "I will certainly do that.

There are however likely going to be schools who say so. And jobs. And eventually her boobs may be big enough that she's uncomfortable if she doesn't. I know my jobs and school have had language like \"proper undergarments must be worn and must not be seen\" in the dress codes. \n\nTo me, it makes more sense to ease herself into wearing a bra when she's still got small enough boobs for them to genuinely be able to be comfortable. I actually thought the training bras I ended up with were very comfortable, second only to my nursing bras once I had my son.", "There is no school dress code or work dress code that is going to tell a female to wear a bra. \n\nProper undergarments can be a camisole."]}
