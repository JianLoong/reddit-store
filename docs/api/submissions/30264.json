My brother married a woman who we all loved dearly and welcomed into the family, but almost immediately things took a bizarre turn and it was like she became a completely different person. She turned him against my mother and me, and he seemed more than happy to write us both out of his life forever. They did it in such a cruel way, too-- my mother had necrosis in both her hips and had to have a full hip replacement surgery. The DAY AFTER she got out of the hospital, he came over and told her he wanted nothing to do with her. Nothing cements itself in your brain quite like your 90-pound mother in a walker crying because her only son suddenly hates her.\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks to a commenter I realized I need to give some more context. My brother has Cerebral Palsy and has been in a wheelchair his whole life. Mom fought tooth and nail throughout his entire childhood to make sure he had the best life possible. His argument for writing her out of his life (and then me for having her back) was that she was very overbearing with him. Which is true, but given everything she had to do for him, I see both sides of it. Growing up the only disabled person in the family, he certainly has a different perspective, but at the end of the day I don't think anything can excuse his actions or how he went about things.\n\nFlash forward a year and a half later, Mom and I have not spoken to Bro or SIL once. Our father has been in very poor health, and I figured the convo had to come sooner or later, so we decided that we would play nice during Thanksgiving and Christmas for Dad's sake because family is very important to him and he doesn't need the stress of us being split up. But now Bro is trying to do more than we agreed, sneaking into the picture when I plan to go visit my Dad alone, randomly showing up to children's b-day parties without notice, things of that nature.\n\nBasically Bro and SIL have turned into incredibly toxic people, their relationship is so strange. It's like they bring out the absolute worst parts of one another. Our sister, who has tried to remain a pretty neutral entity through all of this, dreads being around them and does everything she can to interact with them as little as possible. He does seem to be making an effort, but never once has he apologized. AITA for still wanting nothing to do with them and carrying around massive load of hatred?", "created_utc": 1699036319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17n1ogi/aita_for_not_wanting_to_forgive_my_brother/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My sister and her baby are currently living at my mom's place. Brother texted my mom and sis at midnight the day beforehand saying \"I'm coming--\" no asking if it was okay, just asserting he would be there.", "Honestly there's not much else to it, I left out the fact that he has Cerebral Palsy and my mom did everything she could when he was growing up to make his life easier. She could be overbearing when we were kids, this was probably more the case for my brother, but that's about it.", "Not at all. My brother has Cerebral Palsy and Mom did everything in her power to make his life as good as possible. She was certainly overbearing with us at points growing up, especially him, but I find that at least somewhat understandable considering everything she had to go through with him.", "Have you asked him at all what the conflict his with your mom? Or tried to talk it out at all?", "Oh absolutely, my sister and I tried for a long time to talk it out with him and figure out why he felt this way. At the end of the day all he had to back up his actions was that she was overbearing with him. Which we both conceded was true, but she had to fight for him every step of the way to make sure he had the best life possible throughout his childhood. His arguments didn't come anywhere near being enough to explain his actions, especially the awful way he carried them out. Eventually I just gave up, decided that he was not the same brother I grew up and loved but a stranger I no longer wanted to have in my life.", "It may be worth taking seriously that he had a different experience of childhood and of your parents than you did. \u201cOverbearing\u201d often does not cover what it\u2019s like to be the only disabled person in the family.\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on or want to speculate, and it\u2019s definitely unfortunate how it\u2019s turned out.
