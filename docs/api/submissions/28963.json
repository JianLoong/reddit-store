But nevertheless, I have always said to my girlfriend that if she wants to go, then I\u2019m happy for her to do so, if she doesn\u2019t then I\u2019ll also respect whatever choice she makes.\n\nI\u2019m not a huge wedding lover anyway, so our grand plan was to still travel to Italy and have a holiday out of it, myself and our little boy, who will be 1 year old, just exploring for the day she\u2019s at the wedding. At this point, financially we were in quite a good place to do so.\n\nHowever, this year we\u2019ve hit quite significant financial difficulty. Our 7 month old son is growing in and out of clothes at the blink of an eye. I left my job in the Spring time to pursue starting my own business. I invested my savings into starting it up, and business has been going well and I\u2019ve been surviving, but I\u2019m not at too stable of a salary just yet. \n\nAnd then in the summer time, my girlfriend, whilst on maternity leave, found out she was being laid off due to budget cuts. She got a fairly small payout and has since used a chunk of it to pay off some debts and buy things for our baby whilst my finances have been covering the household bills, car finance, fuel etc, whilst I have a few small debts to pay off as well.\n\nWe\u2019ve had to also sell her car and share mine as we couldn\u2019t afford to run two cars anymore.

Then we got into an argument a few days ago where I raised it and she still hasn\u2019t discussed it with me because I honestly think she is expecting me to pay it. \n\nHad I have actually been invited to the wedding myself then I feel like things would be different, and we could compromise on some sort of cost or saved very harshly for it, but I feel quite put out whilst already in financial difficulty, paying for her just to go to a wedding, as otherwise if it wasn\u2019t for this wedding, we more than likely wouldn\u2019t have been planning a trip to Italy in the first place.\n\nI have always wanted to go to Italy but I\u2019m struggling to enjoy the idea of going next year solely for a wedding when we can\u2019t afford it.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1697369357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178demg/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_girlfriends/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just how we have agreed for the last few years we would be travelling for the wedding and I kind of just grinned and smiled and agreed to it, but now due to financial difficulties, it seems we will struggle to afford it and yet I feel my girlfriend thinks I have some sort of magical money tree and can afford this wedding.\n\n2. I\u2019m not sure if this is just myself taking a no invite personally and therefore am I wrongly taking this out on my girlfriend? But similarly her brothers and even father are standing by their partners which I think is really loyal and caring. But our financial circumstances have also significantly changed for the worst this year and more than likely won\u2019t pick back up until mid-late next year\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your girlfriend sounds awfully entitled!", "Info: why did the bride tell everyone no partners and no children? Childfree weddings are becoming more popular especially with younger couples, but extending that ban to SOs is bizarre. If it was just a numbers thing, the couple could just limit the total guest list or find an Italian venue that can accommodate more people. It sounds like something else is going on.\n\nRegardless, if money is tight then it\u2019s tight.

What can you no longer afford? The family holiday + wedding or just her attending solo?  2. You need to sit down and have a conversation about budgeting to be able to afford one of these.  \n\nIt feels like you are annoyed with her purchases and not being invited to the wedding so are using your (potentially legitimate) money concerns to take this away from your partner.  \n\nYou need to budget to address the larger budget first and part of that needs to be this line item.  But I presume this is important to your partner so should be discussed with compassion and with the understanding that finding a way to afford this might be non negotiable for her.", "Yeah she knows the financial situation but she\u2019s more just not wanting to let her cousin down after promising for the last few years to be a bridesmaid for her", "Understandable but I would imagine (hope) the cousin would be understanding to the situation and not hold it agasint her, even if it was just 1 person going thats still going to be a good chunk of money"]}
