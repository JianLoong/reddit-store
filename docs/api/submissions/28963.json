You can't afford it, end of story.\n\nWhen you're struggling financially, to the point of having to sell an automobile and worrying about how to keep food on the table and your growing child in clothes, this is not the time to blow God knows how much money on some random cousin of your girlfriend's wedding in another country. That would simply be madness and total financial irresponsibility.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nShe wants to go, you're not invited, SHE pays or the bride pays.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have to cut your cloth according to your means. And the sooner she tells her cousin she can no longer afford to go the better. and fairer.", "Most definitely NTA. Is she looking for a new job since being laid off? Why does the responsibility lie solely on you especially since you\u2019re not even invited? \n\nYour girlfriend needs to grow up & discuss this situation and financial situation you\u2019re currently in like an adult!", "NTA Buuut gently, if you could theoretically afford it if you were invited, then you can theoretically afford it if you're not. However, your girlfriend needs to understand the limits here.\n\nINFO: Have you sat down with her and shown her the numbers, or is she just going on your judgement?", "NTA if you can\u2019t afford it then you can\u2019t afford it. It sounds like your finances are not stable and you have a baby on the way. Maybe sit down with her show her what comes in and goes out and how it\u2019s just not there", "Info: exactly how much are you down now she\u2019s lost her job? I believe even if she was made redundant then she still would be entitled to statutory maternity, which might not be as generous as her company maternity but it would help bridge the gap. Between that and the redundancy pay I can\u2019t see there being that much difference unless she had a really good job. \n\nIt might not be the plan but what if she went back to work a bit earlier than normal so she can get earning again? I also feel this situation is not entirely her fault as you had already put the family in a precarious situation by starting your own business especially with a new baby and it feels as though there\u2019s a slight punishing her for losing her job and the cousin not inviting plus ones.", "NTA\n\nThe bride and groom can\u2019t afford everyone so you guys should be financial responsible to. If your gf used her money, that is a different story. But what your 7 months son. Is she just leave you behind to babysit. She is being unreasonable especially she was laid off.", "NTA.\n\nBudgeting is critical.", "You need to get on the same sheet of music. With kids together you need to make these decisions together.  You two may need counseling", "Ask yourself a simple question. All else being equal and unchanged, if just the wedding situation was reversed and it was you going out to be a groomsman for your cousin, would you still go?  \n\n\nYes, you'd go - YTA.\n\nNo, you'd cancel - NTA.", "I'm not sure if this is a NAH or mild ESH. The unpleasantness about the invitation should not really be relevant here - it's not your GF's fault and wasn't directed at you in particular. Let's accept that these are the rules and leave it aside.\n\nBack when it came up the whole thing could be a pleasant activity for the whole family. You all would get an Italy vacation out of it and your GF would get to go to her friend's wedding. The whole thing was within budget out of *your joint resources*. \n\nSince then things have happened like you describe. Her reduced income due to maternity is on both of you. Her layoff is more about uncertainty - maybe she'll find something right away after maternity ends, maybe not. Your reduced income was due to you getting to follow something that's important to you. I'm also getting some vibes about less than optimal budgeting - sounds like the baby expenses were higher than you both expected.\n\nThe budget pressures come from all sides and aren't really anybody's fault. There are no AHs here, and there are things in here that either of you gets to do because they're important to either you or her. At least in the ideal. The stage you two ate at is more about: are you a family or not? If yes, then what you need to get to is to sit down together and look at your *combined* resources, talk (without anger, snipping or recriminations) about what's possible, what's fair, and what the consequences are of any course of action.", "I don't see how people can be angry at another person for pointing out facts. \n\nAlso, why should she get to go on a vacation without you?", "Did I miss the part where she asked you to pay? Or is it all assumptions", "NTA", "Reasonable grown-ups do not do things they can't afford to do.  You cannot afford to go to Italy.  Your GF can't afford to go to Italy.  \n\nAssuming your GF understands simple math, you might want to sit down with her, a pencil, and a ledger.\n\nDo not, under any circumstances, pay for her to go.  You can't afford it.  And you're a reasonable grown-up.  End of story.\n\nNTA.  The A title belongs to your GF.", "NTA  \nYour GF needs a reality check.", "NTA - but you two are in no position to go on holiday. Getting on your feet financially should trump everything else. Can your girlfriend not save by going by herself and bunking in with another bridesmaid, and keeping the visit as short as possible (ie show up the day before leave the day after). Have I mentioned how much I hate destination weddings?", "Lol\n\nI'm sorry but I would have started hysterically laughing in her face when she mentioned me covering the cost of her trip. \n\nHas she lost her mind?", "NTA. And you have bad taste in women. She's shown who she is. Believe her.", "Undercarriage.  hee hee", "You\u2019re not wrong, but in case you\u2019re not from Europe I would just add that getting to Italy from the UK is not a HUGE expense. I mean, it\u2019s not nothing and i obviously don\u2019t know their income level, but with one partner (at that point) in work and another keeping afloat in a business it\u2019s not an outrageous thing to do.", "Baby clothes are cheap in supermarkets too. That\u2019s where I got most of mine. That and hand-me-downs from friends.", "She is looking after their baby and he is working full time. The cost of infant childcare is prohibitive in the UK. More than low paying jobs. \nHowever, they can\u2019t afford for her to go to the wedding and they don\u2019t sound like that can afford a holiday. That\u2019s life with kids sometimes.", "Both my sister and I had our wedding. And we would never dis-allow anyone our family immediate others and their children. If we can\u2019t afford, we just cut down friends first before family. Or cut down on flowers, dresses, decor\u2026 stuff like that.", "Freecycle, my dude.", "Doesn't the UK have free sites, like the Buy nothing group and freecycle? I see tons of baby stuff there all the time.", "My ex husband and I were poor when we were young, we couldn\u2019t afford daycare so we worked different shifts and on each others off days. If she really wanted to, she would find a way.", "I was wondering this too. I know it\u2019s not the main issue by any means, but this whole bunch seems to have issues making good decisions.", "To some people, this is enough not to give them an invite. It\u2019s tacky as all hell, but not uncommon.", "She\u2019s still getting her maternity pay, so she is bringing in money arm saving them on daycare expenses currently. OP said she is going to be paid through January, she doesn\u2019t need to go back to work yet.", "Yet they are also having a destination wedding.", "If she wants the trip for her son\u2019s birthday and the wedding she does. Or does OP have to get a second job? She has time to get something part time and save every penny. Why are you making excuses for her?", "Well that's probably why. Lol", "Common law? That's not a thing everywhere. Where are you getting that from?", "My point is more that destination weddings are already mildly AH moves lol", "It is in the UK. Anyway, it is pedantic to pretend long term couples with kids aren\u2019t as important as married couples.", "I mean you're not wrong. Haha. I just had this conversation with my dad. I said when I get married (if) it will be me and my guy and my sister and whomever he wants. We'll zoom. I don't understand this big hoopla.", "Nah it ain't a thing here. People might say they are common law but it comes with no rights etc that being married would have.", "I mean I agree. I was just saying if that's her thing than that's it. \nI didn't know that about UK"]}
