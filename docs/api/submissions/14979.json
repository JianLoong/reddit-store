Naked things. \n\nEither pay for the extra room or organize a suite option where the couples can close the door and go to town - and your other daughter is going to be forced to sleep next to it.", "YTA, you are absolutely ruining it.

The idea that it's unsafe for a woman alone is ridiculous. Like where is her private room? 6 hours away? Her private room would be next to your one.

Stop treating your adult daughter like a child. Show some respect. Let her pay for her own room if you're too cheap to pay for it.

Majorly so even.\n\nBut let's explain it s bit further:\n\n- You are not only trying to impede in the personal life of your younger daughter by intentionally placing a third person in her and her boyfriend of two years room,no, you are even trying to use your other daughter for it.\n(Hint: They have sex. If you like it or not.)\n\n- When your older daughter invalidates your faux money argument by offering to pay for her own room you show your true colours by now (and only now) putting security as a new argument out there. (Bit racist,btw.) If you are concerned about money and safety why does your daughter not sleep in the room your wife and you use?\n\n- Let's spin this further: How would you react if now older daughter comes up with a boyfriend and he now sleeps in her room? That SHE payed for it? \n\n- Tbf, I even suspect that the flight might be the equally expensive part to the accommodation here - so basically you just pay to keep your \"power\" over your daughters personal affairs. \n\nWhat is your younger daughters stance on this, btw?

Spend the money and get your adult daughter her own room for your family vacation.  I\u2019d be terribly uncomfortable sharing a room with a couple.  Or get an AirBNB so you\u2019re all together in the same house.", "Do you think if you put the oldest in the room that they aren't going to have sex? They are on vacation. I wouldn't want to share a room with them either.

You're being unreasonable.\n\nYTA", "YTA - Its pretty intrusive deciding something like this for your adult daughter.\n\nFirst time i read your question i thought your just kinda pragmatic guy but to be honest your primary reason for this idea are your xenophobic views about cubans. She is an adult with 23, what should happen? You think this is a third world county where they rape and rob you as soon as its becomming dark? Believe it or not, but cubans are living off tourism and its one of the safest countries in the world (ive been to cuba 10x and even totally drunk and lost in havanna random people brought me to my hotel with their private car). Chances of getting killed, robbed or raped are much higher in certain US or Europe areas. Believe me, im from europe and ive already travelled half the world.\n\nIf you just wanna prevent her from having fun you should rethink your relationship to your kids, bc this shows you have serious trust issues.", "Soft YTA. \n\nIt's generous of you to fund the holiday, but at 23 she is old enough to have her own room, and she's even offered to fund that herself.

This is an awkward position to put them in, and you have no good reason why she can\u2019t stay in her own room.", "YTA And what if they don't want to 'just sleep'? Seriously, a couple needs privacy, specially on a long holiday like this. ;)", "YTA. Only because she offered to pay for her own room. BUT she is right.

The fact that you think it\u2019s better to pressure her to share a room with a male she\u2019s not comfortable with, than have her pay for her own room is ridiculous. \n\nRealistically what level of risk do you think there is for her in a hotel room, one that\u2019s probably right next door to yours?", "YTA \ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\n\nOP you do realize you have just told your daughter that the boyfriend is more important to you than she is right?\n\nGuess we also know who your favorite child is as well, nice job, this decision has changed the dynamic of your relationship with your 23 year old daughter, possibly beyond repair.\n\nYou should make the boyfriend pay for half of a room and you pay the other half for your younger daughter.\n\nShow some love for your 23 year old, why should she pay for a room to ACCOMMODATE your favorite child? Wowy you are a piece of work even for AITA", "yta but only because of the part where she offered to pay for her own room and you said it was unsafe. she\u2019s 23, old enough to live on her own or have children or join the military or legally drink. she\u2019s definitely old enough to stay in a hotel room by herself, especially if she can get a room in the same hallway", "YTA, can someone not sleep on the couch? Your daughter IF SHE WANTS TO! Or the bf.", "YTA\n\nYour adult daughter told you she wasn't okay with someone and your reaction was basically \"tough shit.\" You don't even have a financial reason because she offered to cover her own room, you just want her to be a free chaperone.", "Info: did your younger daughter ask you to include boyfriend, or did you bring up the subject?", "YTA-The whole set up is weird asf.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nIt is super creepy to ask your daughter to room with a couple. I would be so uncomfortable if I were in her shoes. Absolutely take her up on her offer to get her own room.

Less expensive and more comfortable, plus you can easily have breakfast or a few other meals in, which will also save money.\n\nAdults should not be sharing rooms like this.", "Why won't you answer how old the younger daughter and boyfriend are?  \nI had a female friend travel through India alone and she is fine.  \nShe offered to pay for her own room, Cuba is not unsafe like that in a hotel where she is likely to have a room right next to you anyway.  \nI would also not go if this was the stipulation.  \nIf this really is the hill you are willing to die on then don't be surprised when you permenately ruin the relationship with your wife and your daughters.  \nYTA no question about it.", "You were NTA up until she asked to pay for her own room.

She offered alternatives and you rejected them because once again you think your DECISIONS are more important than anyone else's.  first with the room arrangements--without consultation and then to tell DAUGHTER OF LEGAL AGE that she can't room alone.\n\nYour wife is right--you are ruining it.  You cannot force your 23F daughter to go if she doesn't agree to go and why should she if she's forced to room with a man she doesn't want to room with.", "YTA because you ARE ruining it.

Of all the countries to worry about your safety in your rooms, that\u2019s not a country I\u2019d worry about.", "YTA. If she wants a separate room to the point where she will pay for it, then let her. She is 23, therefore, an adult and can make her own decisions.

Once you realized that she had an issue with it, you should have told her you would work something out and then spoke with your wife. So go make it right.", "YTA. Just tell them what the plan is and let them make their own travel arrangements to meet everyone there.

When I took a trip with another couple, we booked 1 hotel room to share. How ever did I manage with other people ??? I kept some pants on the side table or floor and when i woke up, put them on under the sheets or when they were in the bathroom. Point is it\u2019s not that hard to be accommodating.
