Why would you ask a new mom that?\u201d. Jane said \u201cfinding something random to start a fight about already?\u201d and got up and went to the backyard.\n\nWhen my brother came downstairs, I told him what happened and he said I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.

Especially when she was a new mom. \n\nNTA.", "NTA and as an 8 year sober person it\u2019s NEVER the family\u2019s responsibility to keep someone sober. It\u2019s the addict\u2019s job to do the work and stay sober or the sobriety will never last. Being sober has nothing to do with having no filter and being an ass. By saying what he did and excluding you from the birthday party your brother has open the door for her to relapse by making her a victim. \n\nEdit;\nWhat your brother did is set an unfair timeline for you to forgive her when she\u2019s made no attempt to make amends to you. You\u2019re allowed to forgive ( or not) on your own terms. Your brother is being an enabler for your sister.", "NTA. Why is everyone coddling your sister like she\u2019s a toddler who doesn\u2019t understand boundaries? Them telling her to not be inconsiderate or ask rude questions would be a risk to her sobriety? What else is she allowed to say or do at the expense of everyone else?", "NTA, those are rude questions and it is wrong to expect you to be involved in Jane's sobriety. That is your choice alone.", "NTA. I understand where you were coming from and tbh I think your brother is the AH for excluding you from a special event over someone who I\u2019m basically insulted his wife who was a new mom at the time.", "NTA, but I hope you understand that it's likely Mark and Jane have a much stronger bond due to their 1 year age difference. They grew up together, and Mark probably remembers her as a good sister who stumbled, while you, due to your decade age gap, probably think of her as just an addict as that's likely all you've ever known her as.  \n\n\nIt's one of those things that can be really hard on families. As such, Mark probably thinks you're being unreasonable, and that he's doing everything to help the sister he remembers stay clean. It's unfair and if you can have a conversation with Mark about it, it would probably go a long way to clearing the air and repairing your relationship with Mark.", "**NTA**. New mother's go through so much, both emotionally and physically. I think it was appropriate of you to call that out (although you could have approached it in a much less confrontational manner). \n\nBut, your family's concern with Jane is real. It's a tough balancing act they're trying to do now, and it's understandable. You will either need to get on board with them or be excluded from more events in the future. You should think about where you want to stand on this issue and have a talk with your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like your brother is putting in work to prevent Jane from facing the consequences of her own actions. Is he also going to accept the blame when she relapses? Hmmm.", "Why should YOU have to put in any work to help your sister not be an addict? I feel like, unless you're passing out drugs and alcohol, you have nothing to do with her addiction or recovery from it.\n\nAnyway... I'm going with ESH, except Lucy. Jane sucks, for the obvious reasons. Mark sucks for prioritizing his sister over his wife and for choosing Jane over you. You suck for starting the argument.", "While I certainly don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, your family (Lucy included) has decided to handle this situation in a particular way. Not a good way but the decision has been made. Since you know Jane is combative, I would\u2019ve spoken to Lucy in private and let her know that she is and always will be fully within her rights to say \u201cThat\u2019s a private matter and I prefer not to discuss it, thank you for understanding\u201d. In other words, \u201cLucy, you are under no obligation to answer any invasive questions ask by any member of my family, myself included. And by the way, you\u2019re doing a great job as a new mom.\u201d Unlike Jane, I\u2019m assuming Lucy hasn\u2019t fried her brain cells so she\u2019s in a better position to set healthy boundaries.", "NTA if everyone else wants to live as if in a minefield when Jane is around that up to them. \n\nNothing wrong with pointing out when someone is being consistently rude and making others uncomfortable.", "I feel like there\u2019s another side to this that we haven\u2019t heard.  It\u2019s very odd to choose her in favor of you when she was clearly rude.

That's on Jane to work through. It's one thing if they were telling her that she was worthless, but setting boundaries is just fine.", "I see why you thought what you ended up saying but YTA. Lucy's an adult who can decide when to shut Jane down. It does sound like you were looking to start an argument", "Yta but you meant well.", "Yta (soft). Your heart was in the right place but your brother is right that it's not your business.", "Sorry but YTA.  Your intentions may have been noble (or you may have just been looking for a reason to pick a fight) but, in either event, it wasn\u2019t your place to insert yourself into a situation that brother and SIL were perfectly capable of dealing with had they chosen to.  That is particularly true since you went NC with your sister and apparently have minimal understanding of the rest of your family\u2019s dynamic with sister.", "YTA. Everybody knows your sister's faults. You're not telling anybody new information. This was a battle not worth fighting. I'm siding with your brother. He seems level-headed and has realistic expectations.", "NTA so your family has decided that your sister can walk all over anyone about anything as long as she stays in recovery.\n\nThey do realize that the rest of the world isn\u2019t going to give a shit your sister is a recovery addict and isn\u2019t going to put up with her being intrusive.\n\nThey are not going her any favors. Your sil should not have to put up with that behavior so your brother needs to get his head out of his ass and start prioritizing his family.", "tell me your family play faves without telling me they play faves.", "right so just be there for you your SIL if she ever decides shes done being second to your sister.

If your sisters sobriety exists on such a fine edge sounds like she should be kept away from a child, but that's just my 2 cents.", "NTA. enabling a clean addict to be an asshole is still enabling. relapsing will always be her choice unless someone physically forces her. I am in recovery (2 years) and come from a family of addicts. you were right to say something and stand up for your SIL.", "NTA", "NTA If being called out on her bad manners is going to push her back to doing drugs it was going to happen anyway and that\u2019s just the excuse she needed. \n\nPOV from a daughter of heroine addicts, sister to a recovering alcoholic and an active alcoholic along with a family full of recovering addicts.", "Another example of how the dysfunctional (bullies) family members rule a family. Saying this seeing it in my own family constantly. I'm usually the one excluded because I get therapy and am tired of their shit. I'm okay with that.", "Yes! This!!", "My brother said Jane says stuff like this all the time and he told Lucy not to say anything because Jane is sensitive. Tbh I don\u2019t think Lucy would say anything even if my brother hadn\u2019t asked her to. She\u2019s so shy and soft spoken. But I truly was out of the loop. I would\u2019ve handled it differently had I known they\u2019re choosing to have no boundaries with her. I dont know what I would\u2019ve done but it wouldn\u2019t have been this.", "Her comment referring to me always starting an argument is because I was the only one to ever say anything when she\u2019d do something. She messed up and screwed us over many times and my family didn\u2019t ever say anything to her or create boundaries. But when she\u2019d do or say something to me I wouldn\u2019t just sit there and take it, I\u2019d definitely say something and it would escalate into an argument. I wouldn\u2019t let her do whatever she wanted to me and she thought that was argumentative.\n\nI can only guess that they excluded me because they don\u2019t want me to say anything to Jane if she does or says anything rude again. If they can\u2019t create simple boundaries with her, I\u2019m not surprised they wouldn\u2019t risk excluding her from the birthday out of fear of hurting her feelings. They think I can take it but she can\u2019t.", "> Lucy's an adult who can decide when to shut Jane down\n\nCan she? If OP's brother got upset with OP for confronting Jane, what makes you think he'd be okay with his wife confronting her?", "It\u2019s not his job to keep her sober. That responsibility rests squarely on her shoulders.", "So basically your brother is putting his sisters feelings above his wife's. He doesn't care how much Jane's words hurt his wife.\n\nGreat husband material, there. Ffs.", "If possible, id try to be there for Lucy as the only family member who isn\u2019t stopping on her to \u201chelp\u201d Jane.", "Lucy may be soft spoken and shy, but i promise you it won\u2019t last forever. Your AH brother is treading on very shaky ground, as he has appointed himself as Jane\u2019s gatekeeper. I say this from personal past experience. Mollycoddling a recovering addict is NOT the way to achieve lasting sobriety. And the extra added bonus to this situation would be: Jane: \u201cI tried to stay sober, but how can anyone stay on the good path when our little sister is so mean to me! If she hadn\u2019t said \u2014fill in the blank, as you know she lies\u2014 this horrible thing to me, I wouldn\u2019t have run out to the bar and relapsed! **It\u2019s HER fault!**\u201d\n\nEventually, Jane is likely to relapse, and she will start treating them both the same way she treated you before. If Lucy thinks Jane is a little rough around the edges *now* she hasn\u2019t seen anything yet. Your brother is a controlling a$$. Lucy is gonna wake up and smell the coffee one day. It\u2019ll be a last straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back situation. And my money is on Jane as that last straw. Good luck.", "Your brother sounds like a pretty crappy husband. He is willing to let his wife be uncomfortable talked badly about just to make his sister happy. I feel bad that your SIL has to deal with that.", "It sounds like Lucy and Mark have already discussed how they want to deal with Jane's comments"]}
