Your AH brother is treading on very shaky ground, as he has appointed himself as Jane\u2019s gatekeeper. I say this from personal past experience. Mollycoddling a recovering addict is NOT the way to achieve lasting sobriety. And the extra added bonus to this situation would be: Jane: \u201cI tried to stay sober, but how can anyone stay on the good path when our little sister is so mean to me! If she hadn\u2019t said \u2014fill in the blank, as you know she lies\u2014 this horrible thing to me, I wouldn\u2019t have run out to the bar and relapsed! **It\u2019s HER fault!**\u201d\n\nEventually, Jane is likely to relapse, and she will start treating them both the same way she treated you before.

But they probably have a point about being nervous trying to keep her on a balanced path. However since you may not have fully grasped the pressure they feel, they reacted in an unfortunate way.

That you are no longer going to be in contact with family that would purposely choose to hurt you to protect a selfish person who has hurt all of them over and over and that they can now feel better because they no longer have to worry about who to choose because I made the choice for them. I\u2019m not going to keep people in my life who don\u2019t want me to be there and they obviously don\u2019t. \n\nAgain maybe that\u2019s just the petty part that wants them to feel the pain they have caused to me but then again my people pleasing side would hate this plan and probably not go through with it. \n\nHonestly I would have a sit down talk with all of them ask them to let you get what you need to say out first and just explain that they are enabling her behavior and that if she is truly this sensitive then she should be in a rehab facility or with mental health professionals because people in the real world are not going to coddle her and they are going to say a lot worse things if she tried that shit with them. And that her sobriety has to solely be place on her shoulders because if she\u2019s not doing it for herself and by herself she will relapse and will fail almost guaranteed. Say that while you commend her for being sober but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to be a bitch and do and say what she wants without consequences. And that while you hope and want for her to be sober and to maybe (if you want I\u2019m not sure where you stand on that part) have a relationship with her in the future once she\u2019s been sober for longer and has made amends with you over the things she did. Cause the truth of it is if your sister sees nothing wrong with that things she did as an addict and the things she\u2019s doing and saying now then she will not get better she will just keep repeating the same cycle over and over again. Addicts cna only get sober and stay sober if they truly feel remorse for the things they did and said and they work to fix it and be better and from the sounds of it that ain\u2019t happening so she will most likely relapse and soon possibly. \n\nHow long has she been sober for?", "NTA.

He\u2019s 2.5 years sober (that I know of).\n\nMy little brother, my older sister and my older brother all lived in a different part of the country than me. I was the only sibling to be left out of his struggles and I was also the unknown enabler as I was giving him money under the assumption he needed living essentials (rent,food, transit to work). My older siblings stopped talking to me because they thought I knew and was still giving him money. My parents had sent him to rehab and tried detoxing him twice. And my sister detoxed him once. \n\nOnce I knew what was going on I went full NC. I didn\u2019t speak to him for 4 years until he moved in with my parents who live near me.

Just because your brother doesn\u2019t want her to relapse doesn\u2019t mean everyone should let her run the show. Tough to say but she was already allowed to run the show and it led to drugs.

But after years of watching them hurt themselves, living in constant fear of that call that they\u2019re dead, there\u2019s no right or wrong way to support them. Some people turn to tough love, some people will turn their backs completely, and others tip-toe around them trying to avoid triggers. Aside from enabling them, I have no judgement about how people will try to care for an addict that they love. And then when they get clean, and for long enough that you feel secure in their sobriety, you\u2019re so grateful to be out from under the fear, and you\u2019re desperate to never go back there. As an addict, you can totally say it\u2019s all on them, and I agree, but as someone who loves an addict, even at his worst, there wasn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t have done to help him find his way out of it.", "this is an excellent point.

The world wants to say otherwise but you\u2019ll be surprised. People can get help, people can learn and people can become better. The question is if the do change, should there past haunt them. If they pay the price, and turn there life around, should that scarlet letter be with them for the rest of there life? Will they always be known as a 24601? Ultimately that\u2019s up to you.

Lucy, according to OP, is a naturally quiet person. \n\nHowever, having said that, I do take issue with the way the brother responded to OP and not inviting him to the kid\u2019s birthday.

It's not what she said that gets me, it's her defensive and aggressive reaction.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong: AA is kinda culty. And a lot of what they do is nonsense.

Just curious because the \u201cshe\u2019s apparently clean/family welcomed her back\u201d part suggests to me that you were totally in the dark about any of this until your brother told you that Jane would be at the house. \n\nIt sorta sounds like your brother\u2019s anger is more about the fact that you going no contact meant he had to pick up the slack. I\u2019m not saying you were wrong to remove yourself from that situation but surely you can see how your other sibling could be upset by that perceived burden? Especially while expecting and having a child?\n\nLike just for a second put yourself in his shoes. He hasn\u2019t seen you in at least a year and in the meantime has been raising a new born while also help his other sister stay clean. Then you come in and get offended on Lucy\u2019s behalf by Jane\u2019s questions when you\u2019re the only one who hasn\u2019t been around Jane in recent years. \n\nMaybe you don\u2019t enough about their rapport with each other to judge Lucy\u2019s perception of the situation. I\u2019m just saying, what if Lucy wasn\u2019t even offended? Because if she wasn\u2019t\u2026well, then you did kinda just picked a fight with your recently recovered sister for no reason. IF that\u2019s the scenario, then YTA", "NTA. Your brother is wrong. It is not your duty, nor his, to make sure your sister stays sober. That is all on her. Tolerating her rude behavior does not support her recovery. Instead, she should be trying to make amends with those she hurt while doing drugs -- including you.", "NTA But the next time something like that happens, I wouldn\u2019t say anything to Jane, but after I\u2019d still say something to the brother. Because it was enough to make Lucy withdraw. He\u2019s not doing his job as spouse letting that happen on a likely regular basis nor are they doin Jane any favors by allowing it because it\u2019s not an undue consideration. Like expecting Jane to manage herself is fine and calling someone on being inconsiderate should be done. A tad blunt/aggressive but unless someone knows your history it wouldn\u2019t raise flags. With your history it definitely seems like you trying to start somewhere because of the way you arranged the words. If you had said hey I think dismorphia after birth can make those questions uncomfortable for new moms comes off waaaaay differently.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is hard, but your entire family is shitty. The fact that they\u2019re putting the responsibility of your sister being sober on everyone **EXCEPT** your sister is fucking baffling to me. It\u2019s your sister\u2019s responsibility to stay sober. Period. It\u2019s completely 100% on her, not everyone else. Your family has it backwards. I\u2019m really sorry they\u2019re treating you this way, and if I were you, I\u2019d be distancing myself from all of them, not just your sister.", "NTA and go LC take care of yourself plz  they are discounting your feelings or what you have gone through.  Do you have good friends, lean on them plz?", "NTA you were standing up for your SIL when your brother doesn't.\n\nAs sad as it is you've found out your family care more about pussyfooting around Jane then calling her out in unacceptable behaviour.", "Mark is quite the AH, you are NTA.  You didn't bail on her, Jane basically ended any relationship with her major lie.  My initial thoughts anyway.", "NTA \n\nFor the reasons everyone said. But also, when does it end? When can they assume that she can safely take criticism? How about when OP\u2019s little nephew is running around and Jane tells him wild stories about when she was using? Or minimises the effects? Does Mark want his son to think fun aunt Jane is an example to follow because look what she did and everyone in the family does everything they can to accommodate her.", "NTA they are enabling her they are treating her like a child and letting her disrespect people because of her problems. She is the recovering addict she needs to be the one in charge of her character and not hope everyone just understands who she is", "NTA. The family can\u2019t keep walking on eggshells around her and letting her say inappropriate comments in fear she\u2019ll relapse. That\u2019s not how it works and the world isn\u2019t going to accept her behaviour and change to accommodate her. From what you\u2019ve said I think she\u2019s going to relapse again. She\u2019s not a responsible person and sounds very selfish. Not going to end well.", ">I don\u2019t know the amount of work they\u2019re doing to keep her from relapsing since I decided to bail because i didn\u2019t want to put in the work to help her recover.\n\nNTA Uh why is her addiction your responsibility? Why is it everyone's responsibility to make sure she stays clean? If you don't forgive her, you don't have too especially when it's clear that she won't acknowledge what she's done, if they want that bs they can deal with it and if they complain to you tell the to stfu\n\nIn regards to stepping up for your SIL that's okay you did the right thing,if he doesn't want to support his partner over his sister that's his decision just tell her she can talk to you if she needs support but best to go NC with the rest of the family as this will only continue", "NTA and I genuinely believe your brother is wrong. Your sister is the only one who is responsible for her sobriety. And she sounds like she's quite toxic and manipulative. She may well hold a certain amount of resentment towards you because you didn't enable her addiction and just wanted a fight. Perhaps you should show your brother this post.", "I feel like you're the only one protecting Lucy. NTA. Your sister and your brother suck.", "NTA\n\nFuck your bro and family, your sister\u2019s condition shouldn\u2019t be put above everything else. I say just don\u2019t give a fuck about them since it\u2019s clear where their priorities lies, but if possible try to be able to support your SIL and nephew since they absolutely don\u2019t deserve to be treated as second class citizens in their own home.", "NTA. No one is responsible for Jane\u2019s recovery but Jane. She is the one who needs to \u201cput in the work\u201d. Not you, and not your family. And the fact that they\u2019re now excluding you because you - at 19 - were not willing to dedicate your life to your 30-year-old sister\u2019s recovery so she didn\u2019t have to is absolutely fucking ridiculous. I think your brother is projecting his own bitterness onto you, and he needs to grow tf up and learn a more productive way to deal with it.", "damn. i feel sorry for your brother's wife. she has to constantly let shit slide cause her husband will never have her back when it comes to jane, all in fear of jane relapsing.", "I mean there must be info missing. Or you\u2019re portraying yourself as better than the others - you met the baby after almost a year. Jane is fully integrated into the family but you\u2019re not. I get that some families tend to stick by the side of their addicted/ sober family members but normally they don\u2019t exclude a \u201ereasonable\u201c family member like that.", "NTA.\n\nI hope your brother\u2019s happy with his decision, especially when he will have to put up with her manipulations.", "So your brother is sacrificing his wife and child to his sister. He should be ashamed of himself. NTA", "I'd also like to point out that the brother has accused OP of 'bailing'.  At the time she made the decision, she was only 19 years old.  Even now, she's only 22.  That's far too young to be considered responsible for the work to help her sister recover (actually, she's never responsible, but I think the age makes the scenario worse).", "NTA \nI'm so sorry that your brother feels that you're the sister that deserves silent treatment. He has it a** backwards & is screening up behind belief. You have done nothing wrong. You tried to support your SIL, which is the exact opposite of what your sister tried to do. The fact that he is banning you from your nephews party is idiotic. Hopefully he discovers his a** from his elbow before you go NC from him & Jane forever. They'd deserve it. Your SIL & niece & nephew don't deserve it. I hope you can talk to your SIL & that your parents can talk some sense into their son.", "An enabler, and has a savior complex. Not only can the family not prevent this, they also can\u2019t make someone become sober. It\u2019s disrespectful to OP and her boundaries, as well as to Jane. Apparently she didn\u2019t do the work, it\u2019s all about him and his efforts for her.", "What if she actually doesn't understand social boundaries though?  \n\nForget the addiction part, what if she's on the autism spectrum, or had sever ADHD, or just socially anxious and awkward?\n\nImagine living in a world where everyone understood the social rules but you... I'd probably turn to drugs too.", "NTA. This.", "Yeah imo addicts need to learn how to function and learn coping skills and this is not gonna help", "The whole post smells of something missing. Why is OP only now getting to meet the baby after a year? Why would they be so quick to exclude her from the birthday party?", "Probably just a mistyped name", "Just because it\u2019s a common question doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not also an offensive one. \n\nMost everyone agrees that a woman\u2019s weight gain/loss is taboo to talk about unless the woman brings it up first. Pregnancy doesn\u2019t change this fact but people treat it like it does. I remember being very self conscious about my post pregnancy weight and would, like Lucy, been uncomfortable with those questions and likely fled to the bathroom too!\n\nAlso how would a new mom of one child know if breast feeding helped her lose the baby weight faster? She has nothing to compare it. \n\nAs for OP trying to start a fight. Yes she could have been less confrontational about it and I think she was just upset for Lucy and trying to look out for her. Coupled with the antagonistic relationship between OP and sister, I can see why it appeared as OP trying to start a fight. That doesn\u2019t mean that was OPs intention.", "Personally yeah. I hear those questions towards new mom all the time.", "Oof what a take", "100%.", "This\u2026being a recovering addict doesn\u2019t give you the right to be an ass and if your family thinks calling her out on it will affect her recovery she\u2019s either not getting effective support or they are just being codependent and clueless and showing her she can act however she wants and get away with it\u2026like a toddler could.", "You can\u2019t prevent people from relapsing, if they do they do, no matter what you say to them. Sounds like brother has a savior complex, and feels he was why she got clean\u2026when again, you can\u2019t make people start a sobriety journey, they do this on their own. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t up to OP or brother to \u201cget her sober\u201d, that is solely up to her. So not only is he being rude to OP who is defending the feelings of his wife, he is taking the work Jane has done away from her and given himself her flowers. Bad all around.", "This right here", "Exactly", "While OP's response could have been nicer, she didn't owe her sister any niceties. For most if not all of OP's life, she watched her sister constantly put herself and her addiction first - to the point that the sister tried to throw OP under the bus when she didn't get her way. Addiction causes trauma. From the sound of it the sister has never apologized nor does she show any consideration for others even now. If I were OP I would still be bitter as well, especially when the sister is way out of line and hurting someone OP cares about. Just more of the same thing - sister keeps hurting the people OP loves with no remorse. \n\nI am so sorry for OP. My heart breaks for her. Her family has chosen to coddle the sister even to the detriment of OP, Lucy, and the child. If I were OP, I would be writing a very to-the-point letter to my brother and blocking him. His omitting OP from the party was just cruel.\n\nNTA", "I feel sorry for Lucy with a husband like that. He should protect her, not sacrifice her. I hope she divorces him.", "Oh so basically they are sacrificing Lucy AND you. Sure, maybe both of you can take it. But neither of you should have to. If I were in your shoes, I'd be going 'Lucy deserves better than an emotionally abusive husband' and blow up the bridge.", "Thanks! \nHonestly a lot of it just came down to a few simple things. \n1. Actually WANT better. \n2. Get away from the type of people that\u2026 encourage that behavior. \n3. And this is the hardest one, you have to admit YOU are in control. \n\n3 was the toughest for me. Specifically with my upbringing, it was ingrained in me the victim mentality. It\u2019s ALWAYS someone/something else\u2019s fault for my failures. And once I admit I had control, and with the control I also have to take the responsibility and accountability of myself. It became so much easier. \nReally though, and as a example I will use a old friend of mine. We were best friends back in the day. And even getting into druggin around, we stayed friends. \nNaturally as time goes on, we split apart. I left to better myself, she stayed. \nAbout 6 months ago or so, she reached out. Naturally since it\u2019s been about 10 years we played the catch-up game. How ya doing, how\u2019s life, etc. which leads me to find out she is still doing \u201cher thing\u201d at almost 30. Honestly I was kinda shocked. But I didn\u2019t wanna make her feel bad, so I just skimmed over that part of the convo. The convo eventually got to me and what I\u2019ve been up to. Great relationships, great job, own my home, etc. With me having a soft spot for her, I made a underhanded offer (not targeted, meant to be offhand and not put her on the spot) if she would like some pointers? Since she made a couple comments of being tired of the lifestyle and people. \nLong story short, literally set her up with a job with decent pay. Tried to offer some pointers, etc. she looked up the job before the interview and no showed. I reached out later to find out why, and she said it was beneath her, she wanted to make the money I do now. Wtf? Like bro, it took me 10 years to get where I am. Getting my degree, went through the 100hr work weeks from the time I was 18 for years, doing the grunt work, literally having no friends due to time available, no NOTHING. And she\u2019s mad because at almost 30, no HS diploma, no work experience, felony\u2019s, that she is to good for a job that STARTS at $25 a hr. \n\nLol ended up losing a nice favor I was saving from a client. But it reinforced my lesson. You cannot help ANYONE who won\u2019t help themselves. That goes for any part of life or whatever that person is struggling with.", "Yes, and I\u2019m going to back up these comments as another recovered addict. You have to do the work if you want to get and stay clean and sober. Not everybody gets on with 12 steps but even without them, you have to somehow face up to what you did and take responsibility. \n\nAnd you need to learn coping mechanisms for the rest of your life. You cannot expect everyone to tiptoe round your feelings forever, that\u2019s crazy! It\u2019s a relapse waiting to happen and not how you help someone recover. \n\nThe family and friends of an addict have to have strong boundaries. It\u2019s awful that a new mother is expected to put up with such stupid talk, because an addict is around being fragile. I would say the family desperately needs to go to Al-Anon or similar. Because this addict will destroy them even if she stays clean.

This is going to get harder because as the kid grows Lucy will have to do more. And one day if she snaps, her husband will tell her to keep shut. This is not a healthy family dynamic at all. \n\nNTA. That poor kid and Lucy.", "Yeah, Jane might be 'sensitive' but Lucy isn't being given the opportunity to be sensitive as well.  And a new mum is definitely going to feel sensitive about issues like weight loss.", "Marek needs alanon post haste", "Honestly sounds like OP is leaving out certain points.", "Yes! To everything you said. Some education is needed here", "No kidding and the idea that just because the little sister cut her off and didn't \"help get her sober\" is a justification to tell her to keep quiet? Absolutely not right. It's her family too, absolutely her business. And an addict needs support, sure, but they also need accountability.", ">And an addict needs support, sure, but they also need accountability.\n\n100%", "The fact they cut her out not taking into account that a young impressionable person has to go through is terrible.
