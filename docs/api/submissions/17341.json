As such, Mark probably thinks you're being unreasonable, and that he's doing everything to help the sister he remembers stay clean.

But when she\u2019d do or say something to me I wouldn\u2019t just sit there and take it, I\u2019d definitely say something and it would escalate into an argument.

Your AH brother is treading on very shaky ground, as he has appointed himself as Jane\u2019s gatekeeper. I say this from personal past experience. Mollycoddling a recovering addict is NOT the way to achieve lasting sobriety. And the extra added bonus to this situation would be: Jane: \u201cI tried to stay sober, but how can anyone stay on the good path when our little sister is so mean to me! If she hadn\u2019t said \u2014fill in the blank, as you know she lies\u2014 this horrible thing to me, I wouldn\u2019t have run out to the bar and relapsed! **It\u2019s HER fault!**\u201d\n\nEventually, Jane is likely to relapse, and she will start treating them both the same way she treated you before.

It\u2019ll be a last straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back situation. And my money is on Jane as that last straw. Good luck.", "Your brother sounds like a pretty crappy husband.

Addiction is not a life long excuse to be a dick.", "Former addict here. It is NOT anyone else's job to \"do the work to keep an addict from relapsing.\" That work is all on the addict, and personal accountability and responsibility for one's words and actions is the biggest thing an addict needs to accept in order to recover. You're completely NTA; her hardships are zero excuse to be thoughtless and rude.", "It isn't your responsibility to keep your sister out of falling back into her addiction, and the fact she used to be an addict shouldn't excuse her inconsiderate and rude behavior.

But they probably have a point about being nervous trying to keep her on a balanced path. However since you may not have fully grasped the pressure they feel, they reacted in an unfortunate way. Still what you said was sensible but you didn\u2019t grasp the atmosphere you were in.", "You are NTA at all and maybe this is petty of me but personally I would go NC with them all aside from Lucy and maybe try talking to and seeing her and your nephew away from the rest of them. \nI would send them all a note saying that since they think it\u2019s ok to exclude me in favor of trying not to hurt someone\u2019s feelings who has show multiple times that they do not care for anyone else\u2019s feelings. That you are no longer going to be in contact with family that would purposely choose to hurt you to protect a selfish person who has hurt all of them over and over and that they can now feel better because they no longer have to worry about who to choose because I made the choice for them. I\u2019m not going to keep people in my life who don\u2019t want me to be there and they obviously don\u2019t. \n\nAgain maybe that\u2019s just the petty part that wants them to feel the pain they have caused to me but then again my people pleasing side would hate this plan and probably not go through with it. \n\nHonestly I would have a sit down talk with all of them ask them to let you get what you need to say out first and just explain that they are enabling her behavior and that if she is truly this sensitive then she should be in a rehab facility or with mental health professionals because people in the real world are not going to coddle her and they are going to say a lot worse things if she tried that shit with them. And that her sobriety has to solely be place on her shoulders because if she\u2019s not doing it for herself and by herself she will relapse and will fail almost guaranteed. Say that while you commend her for being sober but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to be a bitch and do and say what she wants without consequences. And that while you hope and want for her to be sober and to maybe (if you want I\u2019m not sure where you stand on that part) have a relationship with her in the future once she\u2019s been sober for longer and has made amends with you over the things she did. Cause the truth of it is if your sister sees nothing wrong with that things she did as an addict and the things she\u2019s doing and saying now then she will not get better she will just keep repeating the same cycle over and over again. Addicts cna only get sober and stay sober if they truly feel remorse for the things they did and said and they work to fix it and be better and from the sounds of it that ain\u2019t happening so she will most likely relapse and soon possibly. \n\nHow long has she been sober for?", "NTA.
