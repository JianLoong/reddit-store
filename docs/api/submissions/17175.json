My wife and I both work full time and have another kid on the way. Both my parents are retired and live 30 minutes away from us. My mom has been telling my sister (4 years older than me, lives at home with our parents, works full time but doesn\u2019t pay rent, bills, or cook or do any chores, but that\u2019s a different story) what she wants for her Mother\u2019s Day. My sister has been texting me since Monday on behalf of my mom trying to set up plans to celebrate. It started that my mom wanted all of us to play golf today (Saturday), followed up by a dinner afterwards. I already had plans on the calendar for today, but they kept trying to book a tee time around my plans. I ultimately called my mom directly earlier in the week, telling her that I can\u2019t make golf work and that it\u2019s a logistical nightmare trying to keep a 2 year old entertained on the course for multiple hours. I suggested we just do a dinner or breakfast instead. She made no effort to hide how disappointed she was that I couldn\u2019t make this happen.\n\nFast forward to today, we meet for dinner at a brewery as a family at it is just chaotic as hell. The place is absolutely packed, there\u2019s a live band playing, nobody can really hear each other, and our kid is running around like crazy. Eventually my mom says she thinks we should do Mother\u2019s Day as an even bigger group next year, to include my wife\u2019s parents in the celebration so we don\u2019t have to split the days between families in the next few years. My wife\u2019s parents absolutely do not want to make mothers/ Father\u2019s Day a big family get together with in laws every year, they don\u2019t even make plans or really give a shit how it\u2019s celebrated. I react to my moms suggestion, by suggesting that maybe we don\u2019t make Mother\u2019s Day a big family get together at all in future years. I say that it\u2019s kind of stressful for us trying to plan this get together considering that my wife and I have a lot going on in our lives. She is immediately offended and her attitude is soured until we leave for the night. \n\nAITA for trying to cancel Mother\u2019s Day / Father\u2019s Day as a mandatory big family get together holiday every year?

Then plans a night at a not so family friendly place.", "NTA. I am the only sibling without children so I make a point of doing something with my mom during Mother\u2019s Day weekend. We all get together two weeks after to have a meal and celebrate our mom.\n\nThat allows each sibling to celebrate with their kids on Mother\u2019s Day or to do something with their in-laws. Because we always celebrate our mom two weeks later, it\u2019s easy to block that day and keep it clear for the get together.\n\nWhen you form your own family as an adult, you are entitled to determine how you want to celebrate holidays. I understand why your mom is disappointed but it seems like the whole thing was pushed on you at the last minute and wasn\u2019t a very child friendly plan.\n\nI would suggest sitting down with your family when there isn\u2019t an impending holiday and discuss how you want to handle celebrations moving forward.", "Kinda TA.

Imo Mothers Day should primarily be for the benefit of those mothering kids who are still children. You should still get a card and gift for your mother and maybe arrange to see her for dinner on another weekend in the month, but Mothers Day itself should be about celebrating the mother of your own children and giving her what she wants.", "NTA, In our family, when we all moved out / away from home, we switched to sending a joint bouquet on behalf of the kids and calling our mom on Mother\u2019s Day. I think the expectation to celebrate it in person every year, almost like a birthday, is quite a lot to ask of adult children who are parents themselves.", "NTA. Honestly, it is okay to celebrate mother\u2019s day at two different date. Altho, your priority would of course be more tailored towards your wife. And mothers day celebration should be tolerable and permissible to be done. It is okay to make it big but it does not have to be every year big. Having a cake and sending gifts is good enough.", "No you\u2019re not", "NTA- lol she\u2019s trying to make it into a big family event all low key centering on her. Honestly you should be celebrating your wife instead for Mother\u2019s Day anyway. After all she\u2019s the mother of your children. Many times people forget the tiredness of the young children stage or the difficulties of actually going out anywhere. But your mom is still taking it too far by not being accommodating of her grandchild and a pregnant DIL or of a busy young family\u2019s family time. She\u2019s being disrespectful only thinking about her wants and is t recognizing you as part of a separate family unit", "NTA you should have hung out with them a different weekend. You have a wife and children now. I\u2019m sure there are a million other things your extremely pregnant wife wanted to do today. Your mother has the expectation that she gets to eat up all of the day because it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. Tell her it\u2019s time to pass the torch and now she gets grandparents day instead. You\u2019re going to be doing what your wife wants next year. End of story. My mil gets a text for Mother\u2019s Day. My mom got the same when she was alive. We stay home and do what I want and I\u2019m so thankful that\u2019s the case. If I ever become a grandparent I fully expect my children to take care of their spouses wants or needs that day. I\u2019ll be passing the torch. Your mother does not need to be recognized with the whole day. Or really any of it. She\u2019s not in the thick of motherhood anymore.

Gotta take care of your family first.  \n\nScheduling logistics sounds hectic enough already, adding her parents as well?

Is Mother\u2019s Day the only time of the year everyone sees one another?  \n\nI like how your mother doesn\u2019t (at least from the context given) even give a thought that she is not the only one to be celebrated that day and expects everyone show up yearly because that\u2019s what *she* wants.", "While I don\u2019t agree that Mother\u2019s Day is for those who are \u201cactively mothering,\u201d I think that your wife takes priority absolutely, your mom getting one meal like breakfast or dinner in your situation is generous.

Mother's Day is meant to honor the sacrifices a mother makes for her children. A phone call, a card, organizing a lunch or dinner at home ought to suffice.   \n\n\nYour family went to a \"chaotic as hell\" brewery with a live band where nobody could even enjoy the time and conversations with her children and grandchild. She also wanted to go golfing, potentially alienating your wife (and Mother Of Your Child), as she would have been required to either be alone caring for her child (and not being celebrated on Mother's Day) or be away from her child (and not being celebrated on Mother's Day).   \n\n\nThere are ways to honor all of the mothers in your family, but your own mum needs to learn how to be more flexible in how to celebrate with a mother and young child in the mix.

I send a text, that\u2019s it!", "We celebrate every Mothers and Father's day! Sometimes we don't celebrate on the exact day and we generally do it as breakfast for mom. Lunch with dad.

If you don\u2019t do Mother\u2019s Day, there should be a \u201cFirst Saturday in May Day for Grandma\u201d or something equivalent.\n\nI find it abysmal that you are complains about a 30 minute commute when I\u2019ve always done 2 hours one way (four round trip) and got two other mothers as well on Mother\u2019s Day.  I managed to have a special day of my own as well.", "After my first Mother\u2019s Day was spent going to two different family dinners while trying to keep my child relatively calm, I decided that was it.

However, for not controlling your kid and letting them run around a restaurant without intervention, Y T A. Get a high chair, or have a portable one in the car for places that don't have them.

A full on event? What? NTA", "NAH You don\u2019t age out of being a mother. I understand why she was annoyed. And she can be more flexible and lower her expectations since you have a small child. \n\nI\u2019ll have brunch with my mother-in-law tomorrow, and if my mother lived closer, I\u2019d find a way to see her too.

Your mother has lost her mind if she doesn\u2019t realize that the most important mother in your life right now is your wife, who is the mother to your child.

Normally lunch. We have often done it with family groups. But lunch and kid friendly stuff when the grandkids were littler. \n\nA brewery with a 2 year old sounds nightmare Ish. \n\nWe used to do a local pub. But it was super local when bands played. So local that 90% of the people knew each other and the kids were a tribe. So super family friendly. Pub is closed now. \n\nWhat does your wife want?", "Typically my husband and brothers plan a BBQ to honour all the mothers in my family - myself, my own mom, and my sister in laws. One thing I love about my husband is that he insists on including my mom and honoring her on Mothers Day.

She made you, birthed you, raised you and you are her greatest accomplishment.

I will celebrate her as a mother now because my job is to support my child. It\u2019s nice to be celebrated, but as you say, there are other days that I can be celebrated. OP\u2019s mom needs to understand that her son\u2019s first priority now is his wife.", "I don't agree with it being reserved for, but rather, those who are actively mothering should get priority.

In my house, we see my mom and MIL on the Friday or Saturday, but keep Mother's Day open.", "My family has never paid attention to Mother's Day or Father's Day. In adulthood, my brother and I started calling our parents on the day to wish them a happy one, but that's all we've ever done; our parents paid literally not one second of attention to either day when we were kids. After my father died, I was rather grateful for that, because the first time Father's Day rolled back around, it didn't really bother me, whereas a lot of people I know are just absolutely crushed by it after losing a parent.", "OP is NTA but so many things sound wrong with that reasoning of \"actively mothering\".
