My wife and I both work full time and have another kid on the way. Both my parents are retired and live 30 minutes away from us. My mom has been telling my sister (4 years older than me, lives at home with our parents, works full time but doesn\u2019t pay rent, bills, or cook or do any chores, but that\u2019s a different story) what she wants for her Mother\u2019s Day. My sister has been texting me since Monday on behalf of my mom trying to set up plans to celebrate. It started that my mom wanted all of us to play golf today (Saturday), followed up by a dinner afterwards. I already had plans on the calendar for today, but they kept trying to book a tee time around my plans. I ultimately called my mom directly earlier in the week, telling her that I can\u2019t make golf work and that it\u2019s a logistical nightmare trying to keep a 2 year old entertained on the course for multiple hours. I suggested we just do a dinner or breakfast instead. She made no effort to hide how disappointed she was that I couldn\u2019t make this happen.\n\nFast forward to today, we meet for dinner at a brewery as a family at it is just chaotic as hell. The place is absolutely packed, there\u2019s a live band playing, nobody can really hear each other, and our kid is running around like crazy. Eventually my mom says she thinks we should do Mother\u2019s Day as an even bigger group next year, to include my wife\u2019s parents in the celebration so we don\u2019t have to split the days between families in the next few years. My wife\u2019s parents absolutely do not want to make mothers/ Father\u2019s Day a big family get together with in laws every year, they don\u2019t even make plans or really give a shit how it\u2019s celebrated. I react to my moms suggestion, by suggesting that maybe we don\u2019t make Mother\u2019s Day a big family get together at all in future years. I say that it\u2019s kind of stressful for us trying to plan this get together considering that my wife and I have a lot going on in our lives. She is immediately offended and her attitude is soured until we leave for the night. \n\nAITA for trying to cancel Mother\u2019s Day / Father\u2019s Day as a mandatory big family get together holiday every year? Do other grown ass adults celebrate this holiday as a get together every year with their parents, even when they have families of their own?", "created_utc": 1684030617, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gzsmr/aita_for_telling_my_mom_we_dont_need_to_celebrate/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You gotta look after your own. Your wife is a mother too and if she'd prefer a quiet holiday, she has that privilege.", "NTA Your mom absolutely deserves to be honored on Mother\u2019s Day. But, as families evolve, everyone has to make compromises. You are now at a point in your life where it\u2019s your job to take care of your wife and your mom. She needs to trust that you would find a way to honor them both but more realistic for your life as it is today.", "NTA. IMO Mother\u2019s Day is for celebrating women in our lives who are actively mothering children, like OP\u2019s wife. That\u2019s not to say OP should forget his mom entirely on Mother\u2019s Day, but she has other days to celebrate her, like her birthday, anniversary, or even grandparent\u2019s day.", "NTA\n\nI think that you should do whatever your wife wants to do on mother's day and your mom should respect that. You could remind her that there is a grandparents day and plan something then?", "NAH\n\nYou have other priorities now, which is understandable. Your mom also has hurt feelings, which is also understandable. I think celebrating it on Saturday was the way to go, you guys just picked a bad venue. Maybe keep that day open next year and keep Sunday for just your wife. By all means don't do the big combined celebration (but you didn't need to shoot that down today, you had a whole year to do so).", "NTA\n\nYou have a wife.  She's your priority now.   You mum needs some love and assurance, but your own house HAS to come first on all things.", "NTA. Grandparents day is in November.  You and your wife have your own family/kid(s) now. It's time for grandma to step back. She had 30+ years of doing mother's day for herself, it's time for her to let go. Doesn't mean you can't still wish her a happy mother's day, send a card, or whatever, but your wife should be priority now.", "Mothers and wife's should always be celebrated. I think of my mothers age and count how many mother's days we may have left. I'd never miss one knowing we may only have 10 or so days...", "NAH, it\u2019s very reasonable for your mom to be disappointed that you aren\u2019t going along with her plans especially on Mother\u2019s Day, but at the same time you yourself are an active parent and are allowed to have priorities. It sounds like you\u2019re in a transitional period so hopefully this situation will be smoother in the future", "NTA. Mother of 4 grown kids here. They FaceTime me for Mother\u2019s Day and that\u2019s awesome. I don\u2019t need gifts or a big fuss to know that they love me. We keep in touch, even though we\u2019re spread out over the country. The last thing I\u2019d want is for them to do something that would exhaust them. They\u2019re grown ass adults with their own lives ffs. And so are you. Your mother sounds very needy and exhausting.", "Nta \n\nThis is the grandmother, so nope. A call and card and maybe a lunch if you live close and not on actual mothers' Day is enough.\n\nYes, all moms need celebrated but moms need to pass the torch when grandkids come along. Sorry, but the day should be about your wife now, and all gatherings on that day should be if she wants.\n\nI am sorry your mil wants a huge get-together. It works for some but is unrealistic if all parties are not on board. \n\nSome celebrate together and others don't.\n\nWe don't here. Kids gave me my gifts. Tomorrow, since they work and is their first, I am making a favorite dinner and what baby gift to mom is. Will do same on Father's Day. Once they get home, we are making purse scarce so they can begin making their own traditions.", "Nta - you\u2019re an adult with your own family now and they are priority. If mom wants to have her kids for a meal, and it works out with your wife great but moms with grown kids need to stop acting like they can demand top priority with them. Especially grown kids with families of their own.", "*Do other grown ass adults celebrate this holiday as a get together every year with their parents, even when they have families of their own?*\n\nYes, I do try to get together every year, although very commonly I'll come once between Mother's and Father's day and celebrate both together. That's fine by my folks - if either of them told me it was important for them that I come on the holiday itself, I certainly would.\n\nAnd eh, *kinda* TA? How big of a deal a certain celebration is should heavily take its cues from the person being celebrated. You can certainly suggest, for example, that your birthday not be celebrated every year, but it's a bit rude to suggest that someone else not get their celebration. I mean within reason of course.", "Yes grown ass people make time to spend with family on mothers & Father\u2019s Day.\nSince your mom is older, she should host at her house with a brunch & bbq and invite people over.\nThis will give your wife a break from the house and kids so they can play with The grandparents (your wife should stay home or go to the spa).  Then meet up for a bbq dinner at your parents.", "NAH for not wanting to make Mother's Day a big celebration every year, but if I'm geographically close to my mother, I'm going to try and make it. If schedules do not always meet up, then celebrations may happen on alternating days or weekends. It's all mother's big day and I try not to miss one. If my wife wants to drive 2 hours to see her Parents, I'm going to agree to it whether or not I want to go", "Do other grown ass adults celebrate this holiday as a get together with their mother even when they have families of their own...\n\nwell that depends.  If they actually give a shit about how their mother's feel about it.  \n\nClearly, you don't.", "YTA\n\nIt was loud\u2026 so you can pick another venue. Your kid is running around\u2026 so teach him or her how to behave in public (or ask to pick a place you can chill more like a picnic spot). It\u2019s hard to schedule events\u2026 that\u2019s part of adulting figure it out. None of these are good reasons for the family to skip celebration of a holiday. Let alone plan to skip it forever going forward. Grow up, sort your planning/ parenting skills , and celebrate your mother one day a year.", "Seems like you're from the kinda country where mothers only get one day (birthdays not included, everyone has them) to celebrate with the children they raised? Why can't you spare one or two days for your mother? Unless you had a bad relationship growing up. \n\nPlus your mother IS your own family as well. Your parents and siblings ARE your own family. Just because you now have a wife and a kid doesn't mean your parents are from a rent a family service that you're now done with.  YTA for acting like your parents are disposable and thinking that an own family means a wife and a kid alone.", "NTA however yes people do celebrate as a family.. my family does It a bit diffrent. The girls get together on mothers day and the guys get together on Father's day.", "YTA\n\nBut just only... I get it you are grown and have a family now, but don't forget your Mother, she wants to spend time with YOU! Instead of being a wet blanket about it and looking for the negative in all of this, try to plan something where you and your sibling just take your Mum out, can't you leave your kids with your Wife next year and take your Mum out just you and your sibling, and then plan something with your kids for your Wife?\n\nGrown adults absolutely celebrate this day! It's always going to be harder with your own family, because you want your Wife to be celebrated also on that day, but just plan ahead, honestly I sincerely believe if you made plans with just a nice outing with your mum and sibling she would be happy!\n\nYou're just a bit off an asshole for your crappy attitude towards this all, it's ONE DAY a year you have to put yourself out for your Mum! Just the one day, try to have a better attitude and be better organised next year so you can enjoy it together!", "You now have your own family, but that this mean your mother is kicked to the curb?

Mom needs to be more considerate of your schedule and needs, but you shouldn't blow your mother off if you are nearby and it's important to her. She's still your mother, and it's not hard to come up with a compromise.\n\n In my family, when my brother got married and had kids, Friday became about her mom/dad, since they do Friday night dinners there, Saturday is my mom/dad, and he and his wife spend actual Mothers/Fathers Day as their small unit with their kid. We also simply do not go out to a meal on the Saturday because it's still chaos and the kids are too young to handle it (4/6 now) -- we usually bring in food so the kids can be kids and people can relax. \n\nOh, I don't live nearby, but I switch off every other year between Mother's Day and Father's Day because again, IT'S IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE I LOVE.", "NAH. You can celebrate Mother's Day but it doesn't have to be on mother's day. It just takes some effort.\n\nPlan something for the Saturday before. Take the kids, leave the wife at home.

He goes off at night, I know it's hard, he has a mother, she has a mother, she IS a mother, so they ALL should be thought of on Mothers Day, I get you probably can't squeeze in all three of them in one day, but my point is he just seemed to have a shitty attitude towards the whole thing, like it was a bother to even try to spend time with his mum.\n\nEveryone wants what they want. And ALL mothers want to be thought of. I guess he can think it's silly to celebrate when he is grown, but that is sad IMO. He just need to organize better for next year."]}
