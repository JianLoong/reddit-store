My sister has been texting me since Monday on behalf of my mom trying to set up plans to celebrate. It started that my mom wanted all of us to play golf today (Saturday), followed up by a dinner afterwards. I already had plans on the calendar for today, but they kept trying to book a tee time around my plans. I ultimately called my mom directly earlier in the week, telling her that I can\u2019t make golf work and that it\u2019s a logistical nightmare trying to keep a 2 year old entertained on the course for multiple hours. I suggested we just do a dinner or breakfast instead. She made no effort to hide how disappointed she was that I couldn\u2019t make this happen.\n\nFast forward to today, we meet for dinner at a brewery as a family at it is just chaotic as hell. The place is absolutely packed, there\u2019s a live band playing, nobody can really hear each other, and our kid is running around like crazy.

You presumably love your mother, it\u2019s just that she is no longer the only mother in your life. The day needs to grow to accommodate all the mothers you need to celebrate. And for some that might mean it\u2019s time to deemphasize their own mother and prioritize their spouse or themselves. Others make a point to stop by their mother\u2019s to spread the celebrations out. *Your* mom is clearly communicating that if you stop celebrating her role in your life all together, that would hurt her feelings. And you don\u2019t want to hurt her, bc you presumable love her.\n\nYour question is flawed. It doesn\u2019t really matter who is right. What matters is getting on the same page so you don\u2019t harm your relationship. I disagree with other\u2019s suggestions that you instead celebrate grandparent\u2019s day. That is about your parent\u2019s relationship to your child, not to you. She wants recognition for the work she puts into her relationship with you.\n\nBut you can\u2019t keep dedicating Mother\u2019s Day solely to her when you have several others to acknowledge. I think you need to have an honest conversation with your mom. Start by apologizing for getting frustrated. Maybe you feel she drove you to snapping at her, but starting with an apology will help her be open to what you need to say next. She\u2019s no longer the only mother in your life. Of course you still want to celebrate her and acknowledge her role in your life. But you also have your child\u2019s mother to celebrate now too. (Btw you talked about your mom and your MIL, but where is your wife in all of this? She is also a mother. How does she want to spend her Mother\u2019s Day?) Tell her you need to make room in the celebration for these other mothers in your life. After all, did she not teach you to show your love and appreciation for the women in your life? \n\nReframing it this way will help her be open to a fair compromise instead of feeling like the day is being taken away from her. And there are so many ways to make sure she feels celebrated while allowing for your wife and her parents to get their time too! Talk through some options with her and see what feels right. This gives her some control of her own celebration, but keeps you firm on your boundaries. As you suggested, you could stick to one meal on the day of, her choice. Or you could celebrate her the day before or a week before or after. If she suggests golf again, tell her golf is a bit hard right now bc it\u2019s not something your kid is old enough to appreciate, but when they are you would love to go out together and get the little on engaged in the game. Counter with suggestions: maybe you could get a sitter and see a show on the Saturday before Mother\u2019s Day next year, leaving actual Mother\u2019s Day open for whatever your wife wants to do (but still call your mom or send her a thoughtful card on the day of!) or maybe the weekend before you come up and help her tackle a semi-big project around the house, like planting her front garden or repainting the living room. Or suggest you take a half day on the Friday before and just the two of you go play 6 holes, so you can really focus on the two of you. Talk through the options with your wife too, and see what she thinks sounds good to her.\n\nThings are often more nuanced than this sub is willing to acknowledge. You want to make all the mothers in your life feel equally celebrated, bc you love and appreciate them all. So you\u2019re going to need to communicate more clearly so she can manage her expectations. And while you don\u2019t technically *have* to handle her feeling gently, it\u2019s the most likely way to get a happy outcome for everyone involved.", "NAH \n\nBut remember you only have one mother, and she\u2019s getting older. I completely understand not wanting to make Mother\u2019s Day a big event, everyone should go to their own mothers and celebrate separately. \n\nYou go to your mother, your wife goes to hers.

They truly feel that the only \"mother\" that should be celebrated is themselves. And that's just selfish.

In future you need to reformulate the day, such as visiting for brunch ( bring some food with you) rather than the whole day. Containerise the event that works for your wife and daughter too. Good luck.", "Didnt even read whole thing, bro, get some balls, you have wife and 3rd kid coming out, what are you still doing here? Simply tell your mother her time has passed, you now have wife who is also a mother to tend to and that she should get off your back with her whims. Ah yeah NTA but also TA on how you handle it or rather don't handle it.", "NTA its actually all about how your wife wants to spend Mothers day with your daughter - its now about creating memories for your kid and her mother and then you for fathers day when she is young.  The crazy busy brewery with a live band was not appropriate for your 2 year old nor enjoyable for you and your wife.  Tell your mother to choose a different day of the year, but that going forward you will be spending mother and fathers day with your own kids.", "NTA.\nMy mom wasn't really a mom, so we haven't celebrated for her in years, but my boyfriend's mom is just happy if we come by and wish her Happy Mother's Day. She doesn't expect a big celebration or that we make it into an event. Just that she is celebrated as a mother who still checks in on her sons, and she is still active as a mother, even for me.\n\nIt shouldn't be forced. It's not like it is a birthday, so OP's mom can calm down a bit.", "> My mom has been telling my sister (4 years older than me, lives at home with our parents, works full time but doesn\u2019t pay rent, bills, or cook or do any chores, but that\u2019s a different story) \n\n\nwhat does this have to do with anything", "OP's mom giving off \"I am the main character \" vibes", "Don't tell your mom about grandparents day though. She'll want both.", ">Your mother brought you into this world, the least you can do is include her in your plans/life.\n\nAgree with this, but (1) this doesn't have to be on mothers day and (2) in this case the mother is insisting her children conform to *her* plans, not the other way around.", "Nothing OP said suggested he is opposed to celebrating his mom every year around this date. The issue is that his mom wants a big, involved celebration with everyone, including his in laws apparently, every year. That isn\u2019t feasible.\n\nHe is also expected to celebrate the mother of his children. OP\u2019s mom has to recognize that as dynamics change, these celebrations change.", "His wife is the family he chose. He's making a family with her and spending the rest of his life with her. They make decisions together and their needs as a couple come before what any of their parents want. Kids grow up, it's just how that works. You can't expect to be top priority anymore when your kids are grown and married. \n\nBesides, did mommy dearest ask her DIL or DIL mom what they wanted to do since it's their mother's day, too? No, of course she didn't. She just wants everyone to follow along and do what she wants. That's not fair or compromising. Don't compromise with people who won't compromise for you.", "Yeah, when you get married you need to cut the apron strings. Your new family comes before the one you left behind. That\u2019s not to say don\u2019t be in touch or get together but your priorities must always now be with your spouse and any children you have together.", "Who is actively mothering children right now? Not adult children, children children?\n\nOPs wife. So she gets priority. OPs mum has had her share of mothers days just for her and now it's time for her to step aside and make way for the next generation.\n\nI mean today my daughter and I spent a nice time out with my mum where we had lunch and I bought my mum a gift. But that's because I arranged that and how I chose to do mothers day as the active mother.\n\nIf I hadn't then we would have called my mum and has a just us (husband, kid and I) mothers day and my sister (no kids) would celebrate with our mum.", "His mom comes after his wife\u2026 in the end u dont recreate with ur mom unless ur an Egyptian king", "Speaking as someone who is actively still mothering, if you take this route, it can become hellish. I have tried this before and it ends up with me, the mother of two small children, having to cater and accommodate my husband's mother, my own mother, my sister and her family (or my sister has to do all the catering and accommodating) and my sister's mother in law. \n\nInstead of a day of me being treated nicely, it becomes a day of me looking after my own children AND looking all the elderly mothers in attendance.", "My husband always actively celebrated mother's day with me when our babes were small. \n\nIt really gave me a chance to feel special and appreciated. How are littles going to know how to celebrate mother's day or father's day or any holiday for that matter if the customs aren't taught to them?", "And in traditional US style, a holiday does not mean a day off work.", "It was the day before Mother's Day though.", "> (1) this doesn't have to be on mothers day\n\nAnd they were celebrating the Saturday before Mothers say. So it wasn't. And also the Mother's plan was golf and they just did dinner. So she's not demanding they stick to her plans", "Exactly. Mother\u2019s Day (and Father\u2019s Day) is more important for those of us who are in the trenches of parenting. Grandparents who make it about them and throw tantrums are just harming their relationships. \n\nOne of our mothers sent me a text that said \u201cFYI\u2026I don\u2019t require a Mother\u2019s Day gift\u2026 just so ya know.  You\u2019re my most precious gift! So plz don\u2019t worry about it.  I know you have a lot going on.\u201d The other called and bitched at/guilted my husband because he declined to make his wife and small children drive SEVEN HOURS to see her on Mother\u2019s Day. Guess which one we have a better relationship with?", "But... she is actively mothering... the older sister. \ud83e\udd23\n\nBut I get it. Mother's day is for the core family. Mum needs to accept that her son is no longer part of her core family. Starting from the time he married and has children and thus a core family of his own, his main focus are his wife and kids - not his mother.\n\nGod for him and his family that he is no momas boy. His main loyalty belongs to them and not mom.", "I agree with your main point but \u201cactively mothering\u201d was an unfortunate choice of words. Seriously though mothers of young kids ought to get clear priority over grandparents on Mothers Day and most people seem to get this.", "Yeah, his wife is the main mum in his life now. He should call his mum and drop her a gift or whatever but he is in charge of helping the 2 year old celebrate their mum now.", "Tbf it sounds like mom is still actively mothering the sister.", "well it sounds like mom is actively mothering her 34 year old daughter, to be fair. that counts, right? /s\n\nseriously tho what's up with that", "It's not in one day. This was written about Saturday. Today is mothers day.", "Yes", "Right? I thought this too!", "Australians also had Mother\u2019s Day today.", "Not to mention that it was to a BREWERY. While his wife is pregnant with child #2! How inconsiderate can his mom be of her own DIL?", "I'd simply put it to my.mum come to my place and I'll cook a nice meal or even get a take ways whollop easy decision", "That\u2019s right.  USA has grandparents day in September, I think.", "I mean everyone also has a birthday\u2026 imo if you want to have a day where everyone does their best to make your plans work, just choose your birthday? \n\nAt least in my book birthdays get a bit of special privilege, so even if it\u2019s a little more complicated to attend I\u2019ll try to make it work (within reasonable bounds ofc).", "Noone\u2019s saying you stop being a mom at all, just that you stop doing most of the active \u201cwork\u201d since your child should at some point be able to mostly take care of themselves.", "You clearly don\u2019t have kids.", "Golf also doesn't really sound appropriate as an evite family that includes a pregnant woman with a two year old. Op's mom sounds like kind of a pill.", "A lot of these are what we refer to as \"Hallmark holidays\" (after the greeting card company, for those not familiar with the name, not sure if it's really known outside the US), i.e., \"holidays\" created primarily to sell cards and other things.", "It really depends on the mother and relationship! People who come from loving and healthy families often have a hard time understanding what it\u2018s like to not grow up in this kind of environment.\n\nOPs mother is guilting him AND his pregnant wife into making a trip with a 2 year old when she knows they will be stressed and won\u2019t enjoy themselves. IMO a good mother would be understanding instead of sulking and be happy to spend time with them whenever it\u2018s more convenient!"]}
