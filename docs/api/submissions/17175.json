My sister has been texting me since Monday on behalf of my mom trying to set up plans to celebrate. It started that my mom wanted all of us to play golf today (Saturday), followed up by a dinner afterwards. I already had plans on the calendar for today, but they kept trying to book a tee time around my plans. I ultimately called my mom directly earlier in the week, telling her that I can\u2019t make golf work and that it\u2019s a logistical nightmare trying to keep a 2 year old entertained on the course for multiple hours. I suggested we just do a dinner or breakfast instead. She made no effort to hide how disappointed she was that I couldn\u2019t make this happen.\n\nFast forward to today, we meet for dinner at a brewery as a family at it is just chaotic as hell. The place is absolutely packed, there\u2019s a live band playing, nobody can really hear each other, and our kid is running around like crazy.

You presumably love your mother, it\u2019s just that she is no longer the only mother in your life. The day needs to grow to accommodate all the mothers you need to celebrate. And for some that might mean it\u2019s time to deemphasize their own mother and prioritize their spouse or themselves. Others make a point to stop by their mother\u2019s to spread the celebrations out. *Your* mom is clearly communicating that if you stop celebrating her role in your life all together, that would hurt her feelings. And you don\u2019t want to hurt her, bc you presumable love her.\n\nYour question is flawed. It doesn\u2019t really matter who is right. What matters is getting on the same page so you don\u2019t harm your relationship. I disagree with other\u2019s suggestions that you instead celebrate grandparent\u2019s day. That is about your parent\u2019s relationship to your child, not to you. She wants recognition for the work she puts into her relationship with you.\n\nBut you can\u2019t keep dedicating Mother\u2019s Day solely to her when you have several others to acknowledge. I think you need to have an honest conversation with your mom. Start by apologizing for getting frustrated. Maybe you feel she drove you to snapping at her, but starting with an apology will help her be open to what you need to say next. She\u2019s no longer the only mother in your life. Of course you still want to celebrate her and acknowledge her role in your life. But you also have your child\u2019s mother to celebrate now too. (Btw you talked about your mom and your MIL, but where is your wife in all of this? She is also a mother. How does she want to spend her Mother\u2019s Day?) Tell her you need to make room in the celebration for these other mothers in your life. After all, did she not teach you to show your love and appreciation for the women in your life? \n\nReframing it this way will help her be open to a fair compromise instead of feeling like the day is being taken away from her. And there are so many ways to make sure she feels celebrated while allowing for your wife and her parents to get their time too! Talk through some options with her and see what feels right. This gives her some control of her own celebration, but keeps you firm on your boundaries. As you suggested, you could stick to one meal on the day of, her choice. Or you could celebrate her the day before or a week before or after. If she suggests golf again, tell her golf is a bit hard right now bc it\u2019s not something your kid is old enough to appreciate, but when they are you would love to go out together and get the little on engaged in the game. Counter with suggestions: maybe you could get a sitter and see a show on the Saturday before Mother\u2019s Day next year, leaving actual Mother\u2019s Day open for whatever your wife wants to do (but still call your mom or send her a thoughtful card on the day of!) or maybe the weekend before you come up and help her tackle a semi-big project around the house, like planting her front garden or repainting the living room. Or suggest you take a half day on the Friday before and just the two of you go play 6 holes, so you can really focus on the two of you. Talk through the options with your wife too, and see what she thinks sounds good to her.\n\nThings are often more nuanced than this sub is willing to acknowledge. You want to make all the mothers in your life feel equally celebrated, bc you love and appreciate them all. So you\u2019re going to need to communicate more clearly so she can manage her expectations. And while you don\u2019t technically *have* to handle her feeling gently, it\u2019s the most likely way to get a happy outcome for everyone involved.", "NAH \n\nBut remember you only have one mother, and she\u2019s getting older. I completely understand not wanting to make Mother\u2019s Day a big event, everyone should go to their own mothers and celebrate separately. \n\nYou go to your mother, your wife goes to hers.

Yes, there are people who do this and include aunts, big sisters, godmothers, grandmothers, etc. in the celebration. \n\nThere are also people who do not want to continue making every Mother's Day a huge event while they are raising their own families. I have been hearing about these challenges from friends and family for decades. My Mom was a matriarch and raised many kids (her own, foster, and grandchildren), and we did a lot of multigenerational celebrations for Mother's Day. My Aunt and her family were often included. I have friends who really dislike the vibe of dealing with their in laws, or specifically feel like the attention placed on their mother-in-law takes away from their own. I have childless friends who hate Mother's Day for various reasons. I personally think everyone's feelings are valid.\n\nI try to make everyone feel special based on what they prefer--not what I prefer. If I just need a little \"me\" time, I find it without taking away from others. For this situation, NAH. Your Mom wants what she wants, and you can easily validate and affirm that and try to accommodate to a point. Your in-laws are low maintenance, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't feel appreciated, too. Your wife has her own preferences that absolutely matter, but I disagree with many others here saying \"active\" mothering takes precedent. We have turned into a monstrously selfish society. Taking care of and appreciating each other as humans has really taken a backseat, imho. So I recommend you do exactly as you suggested--every year, the celebration changes and rotates, so everyone's needs get met. And communicate with your Mom about why and let her have input on the how and what. If she sulks, try to get to a place of mutual understanding.

I may pay for her to have a little adventure next year!", "I\u2019m talking more about future Mother\u2019s Days he he told her not to expect to share every Mother\u2019s Day together. My thinking is compromise on Mother\u2019s Day will look going forward. And that she should be acknowledged every year even in a small way", "Again, this post is about a son and a mother who normally gets alone. You're hyper compounding an idea in your head.", "Because nothing says fun to a guy with a very pregnant wife and a small toddler like a pub with a shit ton of loud noises and people\ud83e\udd23", "Some moms had their own time. I never really got to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day when my 2 were younger. I have a sucky partner who doesn\u2019t plan. We celebrated his mom for sure. No plans for today. I would love to have a chance even now. 1 daughter is working, the other is away at college. If and when my daughters become moms I guess my chance goes down to 0 for me :(", "Yes ma'am exactly! I have an adult child in their 30's with a family of their own. I would never even dream of demanding they do some crap meet up in my honor. I always tell them I love them, that they're a great parent,  and to have a beautiful day. Then I do little things with my kids under 18. If someday WE decide to do a picnic or something for mother's day it will be me doing the work to honor my parenting daughter IF she wants that...because she is a badass momma.", "We did this last night with my MIL. It was lovely!", "That would be nice and certainly a solution for someone who (as an adult child with a family of their own) wants to do something with their mom to celebrate.  The problem is when an adult child with a family of their own receives a  \"summons\" of sorts to attend some made up mandatory event and is treated like they've committed a mortal sin.", "Yes. OP\u2019s mother is acting like Mother\u2019s Day is her second birthday, revolving around her and her wishes alone. Nope.", "Not when he politely declined and she keeps pushing. Respect peoples first answer", "Yeahhhh. As someone with a passive aggressive MIL I get the same vibes. Everything she plans is something super inconvenient for wife and kid? The inviting the in laws for next years party is exactly what my MIL does. When she does it she knows full well my own parents are not able to afford or physically travel to do it but she can then get all huffy with the \u201cWELL I TRIED to include them if they really wanted to come they could find a way\u201d (yeah sorry my 85 year old dad can\u2019t just \u201cfind a way\u201d to fly to Palm Springs because you want us there because that\u2019s your super fun xmas plan you booked without actually consulting anyone).", "Happy mama's day, fellow Mama of growns! \ud83d\udc96", "This is so f'd up, how many Reddit users would rather sack their own mothers off. Awful behaviour and zero empathy.", "If someone came to your birthday party and announced that they didn't want to celebrate your birthday in the future because their life was too busy, wouldn't you feel a bit hurt? What if that person was one of the most important people in your life? There are nicer ways to say that and definitely better times to say it.", "I'm shocked any golf course would allow a two year old on the course. They're typically focused on keeping the flow of play, especially on a weekend when it's busy.", "You too honey. Enjoy your day!", "Nope, they didn't announce they didn't want to celebrate her birthday. They announced they didn't want to do the mass MD celebration. And with a rambunctious toddler, who wants to go to a brewery with background noise so loud that they couldn't even hear the other person speak?"]}
