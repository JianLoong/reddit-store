I think your sister has a bigger problem than anyone is willing to admit or notice.\n\nYou should know better how harmful words can be, and shouldn't engage at all.

I\u2019d suggest apologising for what you said (if you feel inclined) and set a very clear boundary with your sister on this subject and you may need to keep reinforcing eg literally leaving the conversation and room when she starts etc. I\u2019d also maybe have a gentle chat to make sure she isn\u2019t suffering with the behaviours of ED as her thought processing sounds that way at the very least", "Eh... a little bit the asshole.\nYour sister is so very wrong and should probably get help to figure out why she feels the need to speak this way about people so often.

I'd suggest giving her some space first though, & opening with an apology. \n\nAll that aside, it could also be a good idea to talk to your parents about this.
