All  of the houses in our street have bay windows. It's kind of like every other street you see anywhere kind of deal (in the UK anyway).\n\nI  have one neighbour on the left side who likes to smoke weed and I am  not against that part at all. I honestly don't care. When she does want to have a smoke, she kind of leans/sits against our bay window for 10 minutes, just smoking.\n\nThis has  bothered me for months. I honestly do not understand why anyone would do  this. She has her own bay window that she can sit on, yet she chooses ours. Who does that? But my partner said I shouldn't say anything in  order to not raise issues. This is fair enough. We bought the house so I  want to be nice to neighbours. But to me, sitting on my bay window is  so disrespectful. You wouldn't go an sit on someone's garden furniture  if it's not your garden, so why do this?\n\nSo  long story short, she was doing it again today. The first time I let  her off. The second time, I let her off. The third time, I was so  annoyed that I finally walked over to the window and tapped on it. She  spooked, like she wasn't expecting me. In MY window!! I gestured (yes,  maybe kind of rudely) that she's sitting on my bay window and needs to  scram. Which she did, thankfully.\n\nThis  only just happened so I am still shaking with adrenaline at my big  move. I already know what my partner will say, he will get annoyed that I  ruined the relationship with our neighbours but honestly, I don't want a  relationship with someone who thinks that's okay. Am I being a dick  about this? I feel like an old man shaking his fist at the kids on his lawn. Let me know!\n\nediting to add: we have had barely any previous contact with this neighbour. We live next door but when she moved in, she didn't come to introduce herself when she saw us out. So we're not even at friendly nod kind of level with her.

Just to add, I think me gesturing at her was what made me the asshole, rather than going out and politely asking her. I was annoyed at her doing this so I went the coward rude with the window between us.

So much interpersonal conflict can be solved with communication.\n\nIn all likelihood, she was just being inconsiderate and wasn't thinking of the effect on her neighbors. You can have disagreements with people and still be cordial. I recommend having a chat about it and seeing where it goes. If she's reasonable about it, you've created a greater sense of community for yourself.", "And leaving the bins out too long.", "I like this idea  NTA", "No she didn\u2019t think that.
