I get you are uncomfortable with the situation between your husband and your son and that is fine. I remember being 7 to 8 years old and having no problem being seen by my mother or my siblings naked. The problem isn't whether or not you are comfortable the situation. The question is how does your son feel. Have you ever asked the 8-year-old the simple question of whether or not he feels old enough to shower by himself or if there's a reason he likes to shower with his dad? He might enjoy it because it is a father son bonding thing and sees nothing wrong with it. Maybe he does have a problem but is not comfortable changing the dynamic. The same thing goes for your 11 year old son. At no point should you sexualize or question anyone's motive, but you should certainly have a conversation with both children. Let the younger one know that if he is okay bathing with dad that that is okay but if he should decide he wants to shower alone he has the right to say so. The same is true with your 11-year-old son. Tell him that you are happy he is comfortable with his body and being around you but that if his feelings about a change you would understand. \n\nIt sounds like you are happy with the closeness your older son expresses with you and you see nothing sexual about it, but that's because there is a physical space there.
