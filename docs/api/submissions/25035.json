I get you are uncomfortable with the situation between your husband and your son and that is fine. I remember being 7 to 8 years old and having no problem being seen by my mother or my siblings naked. The problem isn't whether or not you are comfortable the situation. The question is how does your son feel. Have you ever asked the 8-year-old the simple question of whether or not he feels old enough to shower by himself or if there's a reason he likes to shower with his dad? He might enjoy it because it is a father son bonding thing and sees nothing wrong with it. Maybe he does have a problem but is not comfortable changing the dynamic. The same thing goes for your 11 year old son. At no point should you sexualize or question anyone's motive, but you should certainly have a conversation with both children. Let the younger one know that if he is okay bathing with dad that that is okay but if he should decide he wants to shower alone he has the right to say so. The same is true with your 11-year-old son. Tell him that you are happy he is comfortable with his body and being around you but that if his feelings about a change you would understand. \n\nIt sounds like you are happy with the closeness your older son expresses with you and you see nothing sexual about it, but that's because there is a physical space there.

Getting the kids bath robes and asking them to put them on when they go to the shower is enough to minimize any potential discomfort and will also be enough to make the argument regarding your presence in your son's room while he's showering irrelevant.\n3) Your husband might not necessarily be doing something wrong (if his mindset is related to getting wet when showering the kids anyway and since they're boys, they have similar anatomy to his so it's not that weird to him), but unless he showers with a swimsuit on, a kid will start asking questions about why their bodies look different at some point because children are curious and have no filter. This could bring up a conversation that a child below the age of 10 won't be able to fully understand and might create an uncomfortable situation for you as parents if you aren't prepared for having \"the talk\" with your boys yet.\n\nEither way, parents often do things that may not be considered correct since parenting involves a great deal of trial and error and mistakes are pretty much inevitable.

The dad probably just wanted to be thoughtful and avoid an uncomfortable situations for his son before it happened. The son will probably start exploring his sexuality soon and having his mother randomly start a conversation with him while he thinks he has a moment for himself wouldn't be comfortable.

She just excitedly told us that the girl she had a crush on asked her out just as easily as if it were a boy and that's how we found out she was gay. All we care is that she's safe and happy. And my husband agrees with you: it's a perfectly normal bodily function and should carry no shame with it. He's never, not once, made a big deal about anything about it and so she feels very comfortable talking to him about it. Like yesterday, she complained about weird pains and he's all, \"you think it's period cramps? I know you rarely have them but go as mama if that's what it is and hopefully she'll have some advice\". I had a hysterectomy due to my severe reproductive issues (longest period lasted 47 days, for example) so he knew I'd have at least *some* insight.

Neither one of us forced them to shower with us.

I never - *never* - ask them to. In fact, I always tell them that my care is not their responsibility and never will be, but they insist on helping every now and then. My bladder no longer works, so they've seen me have to change my \"incontinence panties\" (i.e., adult diapers... the most sexiest of all undergarments) if no one else was around to help (it's dangerous for me to do anything with any level of activity on my own so they've \"supervised\" me when needed). It's not like they stare or even pay close attention to any naked parts... they simply don't mind being in the same room as us.\n\nAlso, we're Russian-Ukrainian, so I think there's quite the cultural gap here. But we've never found nakedness around family to be odd, especially with the same sex. But even as a kid, I remember being in the bathtub while my brother went to the toilet and we'd just talk to each other. But that also stopped around 12 (his age; 10 mine).\n\nI just genuinely don't see anything wrong with it if there's nothing sexual in nature. But we've definitely had conversations with them about what is appropriate and what isn't and if you ever feel uncomfortable, to not be afraid to leave the situation or raise a fuss. Luckily, they've not had to deal with the same thing I did as a kid. So I feel like we're doing well in that regard. But I get it... not everyone is comfortable with this.

People of the same sex always co-showered in my family in order to safe water (grandparents grew up fleeing into the German Soviet occupation zone from eastern Prussia after the war.

And we didn't want them to grow up to ashamed of their bodies or to feel like there's anything \"wrong\" with them. I'd encouraged my daughter to ask me anything she wanted about her body if she felt comfortable and she had plenty of questions and observations, like \"omg, your left breast is bigger than your right... so that's totally normal?\" and would ask if a certain part of her body was normal or weird. She's said that it's helped her to not be as self-conscious about her own body as a result and she's very confident with it and she literally credits us showering together as part of a reason as to why so I feel like it was a net positive.", "I don\u2019t think of it as a nudity bad type of thing .

There are absolutely times in your life when you may need to your family members naked.  They may get sick and need caregiving.  Heck even just a surgery or minor medical emergency.  People in hospitals need help undressing and, when allowed family members feel a lot more comfortable when it's another family members helping them take off their undies or in the bathroom.  \n\nStill to this day I will absolutely rather have my dad help me and vice vs. than a nurse or aid.", "Thank God.

For example in my state if a minor marries a man he is exempt from the CSA statutes and numbers. If they weren\u2019t married he would be charged and the crime would be included in statistics.
