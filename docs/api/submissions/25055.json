I asked her how much it was, and she told me. I was shocked because my parents never set up a fund for me.  \n\n\n  \nI felt really unfair that they set up a fund for my sister but not for me.

Technically, if the money was invested in one of these special accounts, they can't give you the money because it was already set up with your sister as a beneficiary.\n\nOP, you are 20, and your parents have been giving you money throughout your college years.

Now, if you're at a state school, this may not be the case, because it would be re-adjusted yearly and you would feel the impact. \n\nIf you're at a smaller private school, though, many times, they include this in the initial \"merit\" and other scholarships, and often these do not change over the four years. Meaning, at a smaller school, your sister could theoretically have to pay more simply because of your parents' income, and in the end, with their contribution end up having the same amount of loans as you.

While your situation sounds far from ideal, you sound like you\u2019re making it work and will graduate at least. Until/unless your sister gets guaranteed financial aid, they don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll get the same chance. \n\nIs it possible that if she got a full ride or other major financial aid they\u2019d have offered half of the saved money to you? Or did they not get chance to say before half of the money was demanded? \n\nI understand being upset, but pretty much immediately demanding half of the money set aside for your sister is an A H move imo.\n\nParents also A Hs for not being upfront though. You were always likely to find out eventually, no reason to try and hide it from you.\n\nIf the \u201csignificant amount\u201d is so significant that half of it would still send your sister to college, then sure, some of it could have gone to you. \n\nHowever, nothing here is your sisters fault, and I understand her being upset at you too. As far as she was aware, that money was for her, she was very grateful it was there and it sounds like upon finding out about it you didn\u2019t even talk about it with her but went to your parents and asked for half of it? I\u2019d be upset too.", "YTA. It\u2019s their money, not yours.

Is the working world harder for women in the working world? Yup. Does that mean she will never get a job?? Nope lol. In fact she may have an easier time. Recently a recruiter reached out to me for a job, I said I wasn't looking but referred a male colleague I knew was looking. They said \"sorry we are actually looking for a woman\". I was totally pissed but point being- if your sister works hard she will be fine.  Their arguments suck.\n\nJust because they saved for your sister and not you- doesn't mean you should get half of the money promised to your sister. Do not take this out on her. She is not the enemy. She is a young person just like you. Your parents really, really suck. And I am so sorry. You have to remind yourself it is _not her fault_.\n\nI'm sorry you have come to the realization that your parents are awful.

It's their money and they can do what they want, but it's completely understandable you feel that way. They are wrong that women have life tougher though. Late teens and early 20's are definitely a harder time period for men.", "NTA.\n\n\"They also mentioned that life is tougher for my sister because she's a woman\"\n\nNO, that is total bullshit.   You are more likely to be admitted to a good college if you don't have a penis.  Most good companies are deliberately hiring women, INSTEAD of men now.  That, and the supposed \"wage gap\" has been thoroughly debunked.  Some men get paid more for similar work but only because they work more hours (or undesirable schedules) and are more assertive in seeking promotions and pay raises.  In other words....two people hired at the same company on the same day for the same job title.  One man, one woman.  If they both accept the opening offer, their pay is identical.\n\nThe only disadvantaged group now is defined as straight white males.  If this describes you, then everybody is discriminating against you now.  Ironically.  And many people are happy about that.  (see how it feels?)  But discrimination is discrimination.", "OP NTA\n\nYour parents knew exactly what they've been doing and you need to see this going forward as a wake up call.\n\nWhile it was shitty to suddenly demand 1/2 of it I understand exactly where you are coming from. The fact is that they are giving you such a little amount monthly while still substantially funding your sisters college is not only absurd, it's cruel. When you brought this up that it wasn't fair, that it's not equitable they justified it by stating that you're doing fine so it's ok.\n\nExcept it's not fair, it's not equitable and it's putting you in a much worse financial position going forward while their arguments to negate how you feel aren't very legit imo. They don't sound like they have ever offered to match how much you earned from working and saved up or offered to match the scholarships you've gotten. Nevermind that you and your sister are 3 years apart so they should have been splitting that \"college fund\" at the start to balance it out between you both.\n\nThe fact you followed up that if you took 1/2 and your parents would still be able to significantly fund your sisters college isn't doing them any favors imo. If they are saving $ for her now then why isn't 1/2 of that being used to help fund your current college experience so that your work duties can reduce and your studying and focus can be increased?\n\nYour sister isn't the AH here and I think you owe her at least a sit down talk to explain what's going on and why you've reacted the way you did. Apologize about how it came off with asking for 1/2 the college fund but explain to her that what they've offered and done only for her was not and is not fair to offer the paltry bit they've given you. INFO: Are your parents making your sister get a job/save money as well for college like it was expected for you?\n\nGoing forward you need to evaluate how you want to interact with your parents based on this and how things proceed as well as what is best for YOU. The fact that they are very clearly favoring your sister from what you've presented might mean it's a one off situation. But if it's not, if she has been and is consistently favored in other stuff then you are only obligated to do what is best for yourself.\n\n If you have student counseling options available I would strongly suggest using those resources to help process this and learning mechanisms to cope with it.\n\nFrom experience, parents who do wind up favoring one child don't ever stop it barring a miracle occurring.", "Your parents are favoring your sister unfairly.  Even if they only saved up money in the past couple of years, half of that should have been for you.  This level of preference of one child over the other is shameful behavior, and you are absolutely NTA to be hurt and upset by the unfairness.\n\nI'm concerned that if you speak up, your parents will stop helping you altogether.  Otherwise I would suggest that you let them know that you hope your sister will be assisting them in  their old age, as given their financial favoritism, God know you won't be.  \n\nNTA\n\nP.S.  You sound like a very intelligent (merit scholarship!) and hard working (majoring and minoring in challenging fields while working) young person with a lot of drive and motivation.

Would she be able to attend on half the fund without them? For that matter, would she be able to attend on the full fund without them, or would she also be in a position of having to work?\n\n\\-Do your parents make sufficent money that they reasonably could afford to give you at a further portion of money to help out seperate to your sister's college fund?\n\n\\-Is it an educational fund in her name? If so, are there penalties to withdrawing money from it?\n\n\\-Why did you ask for half when your parents have already given you some money? Was it only small amounts? If not, how does it compare to the amount of the college fund? Include all major assistance/purchases for you in this calculation unless they are things your sister also recieved (including things like expensive electronics, dorm furniture, a car, etc)\n\n\\-How close are you to finishing your program and how egregious is your student debt/interest? Is there a great deal of difference between paying it off now vs paying it off in 5-10 years when they would have been able to save more money?\n\n\\-What country do you live in? Does that affect your sister's ability to live/work safely?\n\nI pose these questions because there are two possible elements to your ask. The first is whether you're being an AH to your parents, the second is whether or not you're being an AH to your sister.\n\nIt is reasonable for you to be upset with your parents if they're showing genuine and blatant favoritism, but less so if they have attempted to help support you and/or there are actual reasons they couldn't offer you the same. Many college funds do not allow taking out money for anything other than school necessities for the beneficiary, or not without major penalties. Your situation is, as you have said, sustainable, if they didn't have the money when you started and her situation isn't garunteed to be sustainable (she doesn't have scholarships yet, so you cannot necessarily factor that in) then it makes sense they would prioritize ensuring she *can* go to uni over making your current uni life moderately easier by removing the help she may very well need in order to attend. Younger children often have an easier time attending school since their parents are earning better by the time they attend, that's an unfortunate thing but not necessarily favoritism. Additionally, if it would have been unsafe for her to live/work in a manner similar to you because she is a woman, or if that makes her less likely to recive scholarships, then saving additional funds for her is reasonable (I...am going to assume that you would prefer having less money over your sister being put at a high risk of assualt/murder. You never know on reddit, lol, but it sounds like you get along). It's still reasonable of you to be upset (unless they have given you an amount near to half the fund in 'help' over the years, in which case you are being greedy), but if they have genuine and valid reasons and you blew up rather than asking about them, that's pretty assholish behavior on your part.\n\nThen there's your sister. She's right, you ARE trying to take her money. Money that, as the situation stands, you don't actively need right now and she actively does/will (again, no certainty of scholarships). Unless the account is like twice the amount of tuition, you are attempting to disadvantage your sister who is in a less secure position than you because you are upset about something your parents did. You are also attempting to do so unfairly by demanding half when you have *already* recived financial help from your parents that she has not. In both a fair \"everyone gets the same amount\" approach, a just \"everyone gets what they need\" approach, and a reasonable \"don't hurt the innocent if it can be avoided\" approach, your demand for half the fund is utterly unreasonable and also both rude and wrong. Demanding money from your parents? Probably reasonable. Demanding money that has been set aside for your sister and which she is relying upon? Dickish. While yes, she could be more understanding of the position they put you both in, it's still entirely reasonable of her to be pissed at you for potentially fucking up her life over something you *don't actually need* right now. Some people will argue that it's your parents' money until it's in her hands, and while that may be true (depending on the nature of the fund), even if it is it's still something she has relied upon and a difference she likely cannot make up in the time left for her to start college. Especially if the amount would mean she likely has to work during college to keep up with bills as well.\n\nSo yeah, you are almost definitely an asshole to your sister, but likely not to your parents, given the situation (unless they have given you a great deal of financial help you are completely discounting, which is possible from how you phrased things and I suggest you run the numbers at some point). I would suggest suggesting to them that they could help out a bit more and then save up for a bit longer to help you pay off your loans in few years to make things fairer, rather than demanding a chunk of cash that someone else is effectively already using. That's a much more reasonable agreement to come to, and much less likely to make your sister disown you if you actually went through with it lol", "NTa, but given systemic misogyny and inequities in pay/future earnings and the rest of the shit your sister will face as a woman maybe your parents are justified in allocating a greater portion of money to your sister at this life stage. You should ask them what the percentage split is on any inheritance will be - if they toss an extra 5-10% of the death pot does it all equal out?", "I am guessing your sister is the favorite. I would be beyond frustrated and hate it when people say \u201cshe\u2019s a female so she has it rougher.\u201d \n\nHonestly I would take whatever they give you and then go no contact when you graduate.

Good luck.", ">Are your parents making your sister get a job/save money as well for college like it was expected for you?\n\n  \nShe's never worked. That's another reason why I get frustrated.

She may have expected that her brother get a similar amount.\n\nShe could be an arse but at this point  it's a reflection on her parents and how they have brought her up.  They are the real arses.", ">how much they've already helped you\n\n  \nThey didn't pay a dime for college. All the expenses are covered by the scholarship I got or by loans. They help me with just a few dollars a month, and I cover my expenses by working.", "Except what's going to happen is that despite his lack of parents help the OP will be a very successful person in his field and will earn good money and have a comfortable like.  His entitled sister... maybe not so much because she's never had to work like the OP has and perhaps never will.\n\nSo the parents will give the bulk, if not all, of the inheritance to the sister because the son already has a good life and doesn't want for money.\n\nHowever with how the parents are treating the OP.. they need to hope they have enough money to support them in their old age.  OP ain't gonna be helping them.

Cast a wide net with your applications and if you have time, maybe get some research experience as an undergrad.
