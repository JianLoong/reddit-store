{"id": 5978, "submission_id": "zyiws1", "title": "AITA for trying to \"parent\" someone else's kid and then calling the cops on them over Christmas decorations?", "selftext": "I live in a neighborhood that's considered \"quaint\" and a popular destination amongst locals during the holidays for our holiday light displays. My home has a little pathway and lawn on both sides, and it's fenced in all around (but it's more of a decorative fence that's wooden and waist high). \n\nThe issue started when I got a notification on my home camera that someone was moving in my front yard. I work from home so peeped out and saw a girl (about 6 or 7) running in my yard. By the time I got outside to check it out, the girl had broken some decorations. She pulled lollipop heads off their stands and knocked over one of my reindeer and one of the antlers snapped off. \n\nHer mother was just laughing and watching, so I ran over and kindly (honestly, I swear) asked the mother to grab her kid. The mom got super annoyed and called me a grinch and said if I didn't want kids playing on my lawn then I shouldn't put out decorations or leave my gate unlocked (I leave it unlocked so its easier for the mailman to get in).\n\nHer answer annoyed me, so I told her to leave or else I'd call the cops. She called me a bitch (in front of her kid) and left with her. \n\nI was so mad, I did lock my gate in case she came back. Lo and behold, she returned, and this time I caught her on camera lifting her kid up and over the fence on purpose. I didn't feel like going out and having an argument with the lady again, so I ended up just calling the cops saying there were trespassers on my property. \n\nBy the time they came, her daughter had trashed some of my inflatables. The cops told her pretty nicely to leave, but the mother got in their face and started yelling. It caused a bit of a scene, and I ended up coming out. The cops asked if I wanted to press charges, but I said no if the lady promised to never come back. \n\nA few of my neighbors saw and it's been quite a conversation in my community. One neighbor said I was an AH for calling the cops, but another said I did the right thing because the same little girl took one of her angel decorations and the mom wouldn't give it back. I do feel bad because the girl cried a lot though, so I'm not sure.", "created_utc": 1672353667, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyiws1/aita_for_trying_to_parent_someone_elses_kid_and/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sure even the neighbor who thought you did the wrong thing would feel differently when the mom and daughter decided to make their yard their own personal playground after trashing yours. The fact that the mom lost it and yelled in the face of the cops shoe showed up proves that you weren\u2019t dealing with someone who could be rational or calm about it. I would have pressed charges. Absolutely NTA.", "Oh brother. NTA and thank you for modeling to the kid that actions have consequences. Apparently she doesn't get a lot of that at home.", "NTA.  And it's not even close.\n\nThe mother is a terrible parent and is actually encouraging this destructive behavior on her child.", "NTA and I would have pressed charges for the vandalism!", "NTA. You were too nice tbf. If the child gets hurt on your property you could be held liable for that. It would be in your best interest to have both the mother and her child trespassed. If they come back after that you should have them arrested. You have a fence around your property for a reason. They need to respect that. If they don't whatever happens in on them.", "NTA. It's your property. You made it very clear that she wasn't welcome, and why. She clearly just wanted to feel like she \"won,\" so she went back and let her kid run wild *again* just to spite you.\n\nYou're also not the only one that she's disrespecting like this. If she comes back again, tell the police that you want to press charges. Maybe some actual consequences will teach her how to respect her neighbors. It's a shame that the kid got caught up in it, but that's not your problem.", "NTA - they had absolutely no right to be on your property.", "NTA  Entitled mother fucks around and finds out.

Obviously kids will be kids but that doesn\u2019t mean the mother should allow the kid to do break property and trespass.", "NTA the girl is just a product of her mother.

It's a ridiculous excuse that the gate was unlocked.  It would be the same if there was no gate at all.", "NTA - Do stupid things, earn a cop visit. Nothing supports a parent enabling their child destroying private property. Sorry you were the victim of entitled behavior.  Press charges when she returns.", "NTA.

The kid is the mam\u2019s responsibility and her crying is because of her mother\u2019s choices not yours. You let her off nicely. All she got was telling off by someone she might actually listen to this time.", "NTA\n\nAnd how in heck is that trying to 'parent' some else's kid?
