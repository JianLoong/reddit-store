My home has a little pathway and lawn on both sides, and it's fenced in all around (but it's more of a decorative fence that's wooden and waist high). \n\nThe issue started when I got a notification on my home camera that someone was moving in my front yard. I work from home so peeped out and saw a girl (about 6 or 7) running in my yard. By the time I got outside to check it out, the girl had broken some decorations. She pulled lollipop heads off their stands and knocked over one of my reindeer and one of the antlers snapped off. \n\nHer mother was just laughing and watching, so I ran over and kindly (honestly, I swear) asked the mother to grab her kid. The mom got super annoyed and called me a grinch and said if I didn't want kids playing on my lawn then I shouldn't put out decorations or leave my gate unlocked (I leave it unlocked so its easier for the mailman to get in).\n\nHer answer annoyed me, so I told her to leave or else I'd call the cops. She called me a bitch (in front of her kid) and left with her. \n\nI was so mad, I did lock my gate in case she came back. Lo and behold, she returned, and this time I caught her on camera lifting her kid up and over the fence on purpose. I didn't feel like going out and having an argument with the lady again, so I ended up just calling the cops saying there were trespassers on my property. \n\nBy the time they came, her daughter had trashed some of my inflatables. The cops told her pretty nicely to leave, but the mother got in their face and started yelling. It caused a bit of a scene, and I ended up coming out. The cops asked if I wanted to press charges, but I said no if the lady promised to never come back. \n\nA few of my neighbors saw and it's been quite a conversation in my community.
