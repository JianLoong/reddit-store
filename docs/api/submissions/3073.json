As soon as I saw him I was thinking meet cute, holiday movie, cuffing season, etc. etc.\n\nI was pretty tipsy and noticed that it looked like he had left the bar and I was really bummed so I went out to my car to grab my phone. I just so happen to see him sitting in the car next to mine and it looked like he was texting.\n\nMy car has some damage on it that\u2019s been there for a really long time that I\u2019ll probably never get fixed but it gave me an idea so I knocked on his window and of course he looked very surprised and I started saying hey I think you hit my car. \n\nWhat I was expecting to happen was for him to have a good sense of humor about it get out, we start chatting, we exchange numbers and so on and so forth. What actually happened is he got out and he started screaming I didn\u2019t hit your fucking car that damage has been there forever what the hell is wrong with you? I was like whoa OK never mind then and I tried to walk away and he started coming after me and said you scared the fucking shit out of me what the hell are you trying to pull what scam is this what are you doing?\n\nWhat it probably looked like to people on the street was that this guy was chasing after me screaming at me and I was telling him to leave me alone and then a whole bunch of guys and bouncers from the front of the bars got involved and told him to go the fuck away. He did. I thought that was the end of it but a mutual friend just called me and said that this guy has severe ptsd from being in the military and my behavior triggered it and this guy is having a miserable day. \n\nI feel really bad and I\u2019m not sure what I should do. AITA?\n\nEdit: wow people are really mean. Yes it was dumb but I\u2019m not good at \u201chitting on\u201d guys and I thought it was cute.

The initial outburst is understandable, but to chase you down is just uncalled for. PTSD is hell to navigate through, my grandfather suffered from it for over 40 years before he died.

If you wanted to talk with him out in the parking lot, there were less moronic ways to do it. If you knocked and said, \"hey, you're cute\" or whatever other flirty nonsense you can muster and he *still* flew off the handle, the *he* would be the bad guy.
