Back the F up. The 18yr olds are highly likely the ones who caused this mess, and it just shows how stupid and immature they are, thinking it's a good idea to let the younger ones join in on their secret. They ruined their own fun, if only they had kept it to 18+ only. \n(I'm not saying they did no wrong, but everyone knows that at that age you do things like this with friends so it's to be expected at 18+.)\n\nYou were the messenger and are not at fault for stopping them, if anything you hopefully stopped 13yr olds from getting seriously sick from whatever they were drinking.

This is something that will damage their health.", "NTA. They value keeping up false appearances, even if it means letting something that can harm their grandkids continue.
