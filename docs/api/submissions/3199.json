Lmaoo the logic is immaculate", "NTA, you were just giving an honest reaction, and you\u2019re the parent who found out. How they deal with their kids isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA if it was in my home I\u2019d want to know so it could be dealt with immediately. Waiting would only resulted in drunk and high minors.", "NTA.  Sounds like they are all shooting the messenger here.  The kids lied and snuck in shit they weren\u2019t supposed to\u2026.and that\u2019s your fault for calling attention to it?", "NTA - Let me get this straight, you find extremely under age minors drinking alcohol and smoking and tell your family members, and it's your fault Thanksgiving was ruined? Back the F up. The 18yr olds are highly likely the ones who caused this mess, and it just shows how stupid and immature they are, thinking it's a good idea to let the younger ones join in on their secret. They ruined their own fun, if only they had kept it to 18+ only. \n(I'm not saying they did no wrong, but everyone knows that at that age you do things like this with friends so it's to be expected at 18+.)\n\nYou were the messenger and are not at fault for stopping them, if anything you hopefully stopped 13yr olds from getting seriously sick from whatever they were drinking. And whomever the parents involved were, they will hopefully deal with their kids like they should and maybe work things out with the other family members once everyone is cooled down. \n\nThanksgiving got ruined due to dumb teens doing dumb teen things while thier own parents were around. LOL", "Nta\n\nThe people in your family are trying to blame you for the truth that they were trying to ignore...", "NTA. Underage kids' drinking and smoking should absolutely be highlighted to their parents. You didn't ruin thanksgiving. The kids did by doing something they knew was wrong and then trying to hide it. You don't need to give them a pass because it's Thanksgiving. It's not like they were sneaking an extra slice of pie or feeding the dog turkey under the table. This is something that will damage their health.", "NTA. They value keeping up false appearances, even if it means letting something that can harm their grandkids continue. The younger kids aren't going to know limits and are more likely to drink and smoke themselves sick. Stopping it sooner was needed.\n\nDon't feel guilted because they'd rather bury their heads in the sand.", "It's unfortunate that this incident ruined your thanksgiving, however it's not your fault that the children decided to do what they did. Hard to say for sure because it depends on many aspects of how the situation unfolded but I lean towards NTA.", "NTA. You didn't ruin anything, other than your parents' illusions.", "NTA  did your parents think it was ok for underage drinking to be going on upstairs?? Were you supposed to let them continue and if you had what would the parents reaction have been then? I doubt they would have been grateful for you letting it continue.Your parents are wrong - the kids ruined Thanksgiving, not you.", "Smoking and drinking at a young age is extremely dangerous. And I'm not just talking about the long-term consequences. You don't want to know how many young children are hospitalized with alcohol poisoning each year. Good that you intervened right away. Too bad the adults present were not able to behave like adults and calmly try to find out who brought what.\r  \n\r  \nNTA.", "NTA - the kids drinking and smoking weed illegally ruined  thanksgiving. Do your parents not realize that if anything happened to those kids b/c they\u2019d been doing things they shouldn\u2019t have been doing, the home owner may be held legally/criminally responsible because there was underage drinking going on in their home?", "NTA. In all seriousness would the teens not have been obvious anyhow once they came downstairs? The head in the sand thing is ridiculous as well as blaming you as the messenger.", "Nta.  They are though", "Absolutely NTA. It is not legal for children to drink and is a  major safety issue. I mean just the part about them drinking/drinking upstairs is terrifying because they would have to walk down those stairs eventually. The other parents\u2019 response was not your responsibility. What did your parents want instead? Thanksgiving go on as expected and a kid end up with alcohol poisoning and/or injured?\n\nI also want to add your parents are AHs for prioritizing their own wants over the safety of several children in their home.", "NTA\n\nWhen alcohol and \u2018drugs\u2019 (I don\u2019t consider marijuana a drug-it\u2019s medicine when correctly prescribed) are being consumed the parents must be informed. If OP would have waited and something unfortunate happened, OP could go to jail/prison. Also, if OP waiting they would have consumed more and some serious issues could have occurred- again, jail/prison. \n\nYou did the right think regardless of thanksgiving being ruined. \n\nParenting>party", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.

When kids that old drink, that is how accidents, holiday hospital trips and disorder happen.  You were right to bring to everyones attn.  Your parents only have one thing on their minds and that is a peaceful holiday at a table which unfortunately wasnt possible.

The parents could equally have waited till after the party to yell at their kids, if that's what's being seen as the problem. \nIf it was my kids, I'd want to know at the time, not hours later or the next day.
