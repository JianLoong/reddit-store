Obvi if you enjoyed talking with your father you would pick up. So trust yourself. He's an AH and since he only called to yell at you. The fact taht he called to get you to tell him where you Mom is makes him doubly the AH. Don't feel bad about putting him in your voice mail where you can decide to call him back when and if he has anything nice to say. \n\nIf you feel up to it, send a text telling your dad, should he actually want to be in your life he'd best figure out how to be a positive influence in your life, or failing that he will be left on read.", "NTA.

Also, stick to texting with him until you straighten this out, if you do say anything. That way he can\u2019t yell at you or get upset. I mean he can, but you don\u2019t have to listen the the tone and negativity of what he says. I know most young people prefer to text. \n\nI have a young adult daughter who when she first moved out,  rarely heard from her. We were always close so I really missed her. But leaned real quick not to guilt trip her if I wanted to have any relationship at all. So I waited patiently as she moved to another state and now she texts me way more often. She\u2019s in her 20s now. She knows I like history so she\u2019s been sharing stuff with me from her history class she\u2019s taking in college. She did the same thing with history in high school, because it was an extra online class so she was able to take college classes in high school. So history is something we can chat about. I used to talk to my dad a lot about history before he died."]}
