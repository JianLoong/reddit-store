Our kids are close in age but have vey different personalities. My son (16M) is an extrovert, has a very active social life and does a lot of activities. My stepson (17M) is an introvert that prefers to stay home and does not have much going on in his life outside of school. They still have a good relationship, even playing videogames together sometimes. \n\nMy son was not on board with the DisneyWorld idea at all. He had not interest in doing this kind of trip with his family and was specially upset because it would make him miss his current girlfriend's birthday. He was really angry about the situation, yelling at me multiple times demanding to stay at home instead of going to the trip and accusing us of ruinning his life. On the other hand, my stepson was really excited about the trip.\n\nMy husband is used to having a kid with no friends when doing plans like this so he didn't expect my son's reaction. I felt that going just with my stepson would be anticlimactic and wouldn't fulfill the original idea of it being a trip for the whole family. I also didn't want to leave my son fully alone with all the house to himself. We decided to leave them both so my stepson can keep an eye on my son's behaviour while me and my husband have a romantic trip just for the two of us.\n\nMy stepson is sad because he wanted to go to the trip but my son is happy about the new plan. My stepson was more intense about his disappointment at first, crying and whining a lot, but he has mostly calm down by now. I asked my son to try to include his stepbrother a little in his social life while we are out so he wouldn't be so lonely and he said he would try to. My husband feels bad for his son being sad but I am convinced this is the best solution for everyone.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1682979733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13537ar/aita_for_uninviting_my_stepson_from_our/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How is this the \"best solution\"? If you\u2019re worried about your son's behavior while you\u2019re gone, hire a babysitter (even though he is too old for that and should be responsible to be home alone) instead of forcing that role onto your step-son or consider that his behavior is due to your parenting OP\n\nInstead of letting your son's behavior slide and punishing your step-son because of his behavior; you should properly discipline your child and not enable his horrible behavior.\n\nYour husband is also an AH for letting you do this to his son.

You're not just depriving the 17yo of a trip he really wanted to go on, but you're making him responsible for monitoring your 16yo while you and your husband get to have a romantic getaway? \n\nYour stepson did nothing wrong and doesn't deserve to have the trip taken away from him. He was enthusiastic and looking forward to the trip.

Your son manipulated you into leaving him home, so to make it easier on yourself you\u2019re punishing your stepson by dis-inviting him? So your stepson bears the brunt if your bad parenting choices?

YTA big time. You\u2019re like one of those evil stepmothers. I won\u2019t be surprised if your stepson will go NC to both you and your husband.

It makes sense that your own son is an entitled brat.", "Poor step son \nThe only way for him to get heard would be to act like an entitled brat like your son. \n\nHe was clearly excited but because the king decided he didn\u2019t want to go and obviously he isn\u2019t not well behaved, you are using your stepson as a mental crutch. \n\nJust go the 3 of you. (Or force your son to come. I don\u2019t see why you changed your plans just for him and made your step son suffer as the same time). \n\n3 people is still a family.

It sounds like the root of the problem here is that you don't trust your son to be on his own while the rest of you are on your trip.  That's a problem, but it's something to be worked out between you and him.  Your stepson doesn't need to be punished for it.  If someone has to stay and supervise your son, you or your husband should, not him.", "YTA - Evil stepmom vibes. Do better. Gross.", "YTA and so is your husband for letting you do this to his son.", "YTA - seems like the problem is your son, why should the step son that did want to go suffer because of someone else's tantrum? It is not the best solution for your step son, it is the best solution for you and you alone.", "YTA. \n\nNice of you to put yours and your son\u2019s desires first.

You are punishing your stepson by taking away a vacation you already told him he was going on, when your son is the one being a dick. You said your stepson is an introvert, but that doesnt mean he doesn\u2019t have any friends, right? Let him bring a friend along instead, and make your son stay with a family member if you don\u2019t want him left alone.", "YTA.  Your kid has a fit  and gets to stay home,  so you make stepson stay home also?\nYou and your husband are both assholes", "YTA. Your son pitched a fit like a toddler so you punished your stepson to appease him? Of course YTA. The fact that your 16 year old can\u2019t figure out how to behave like a mature human being is not your stepson\u2019s fault- I\u2019m pretty sure if the roles were reversed you\u2019d be pissed your stepson was unhappy, yet you don\u2019t seem at all concerned that your own child is whining like a four year old. Your blatant favoritism is astounding.", "Yes, YTA. You had one son that was actually looking forward to this trip and another not. You should haven't uninvited the one that actually wanted to go....make it up to him by inviting him again and admitting your faults. \n\nDon't punish him bc your other son didn't want to go.", "YTA. Your stepson wanted to spend time with you...and you didn't want to spend time with him.\n\nI hope you see Cinderella in Disneyland; you're exactly the Evil Stepmom. You have a stepson and are making him work instead of spending time together as a family. YTA big time on this one.", "YTA.  Should have made your son go on the trip.  Stepson got punished because your son had a little tantrum because no doubt his high school girlfriend has been whining about her birthday and can't have him go away for a few days.  Your son won't be inviting him anywhere - your son will be with his girlfriend the whole time.  And you know it. Even the way you described the stepson as 'crying and whining' when its exactly what your kid did only you made him sound less like a child.", "YTA. Are there any family or friends in the area that can keep your son.  Giving into on. And basically, punishing the other by making the stepson stay home to babysit.", "YTA.", "Wow. Yes, YTA.\n\nWhy refer to your stepson as acting like a baby, when your own son did the same?", "YTA, and wtf? If your son don't want to go, then ok, don't force him I guess. He's 16, old enough to stay alone at home without a babysitter.\n\nBut come on, why are you punishing your stepson? And why is your husband ok with that? It's family even if your son isn't here. Your stepson is family too. Don't punish him because your son don't want to go, and APOLOGIZE, please.\n\nAnd for real, what's wrong with your kid? He can yell and throw a tantrum and accuse you of ruining his life because *he's going to Disneyland*? And you're not punishing him? He should be the one being punished lol, not your stepson.", "YTA, you invited him and because he wants to go and your son doesn't you're going to not take him? In what world does that make sense?\n\nIf you're annoyed your son doesn't want to go, that's no reason to punish step son.\n\nIf your son wouldn't enjoy it, that's no reason to punish step son. \n\nI could go on but the fact is, your son wants to spend time with his girlfriend. Your step son is excited and you're considering that step son can't come because your son doesn't want to go. \n\nHe has done nothing wrong. If your husband goes with you and without his son, he's a horrible father. For even considering asking, you're a horrible mother for raising a brat and a sad excuse for a step mother.", "YTA. Why are you punishing your step-son for your son being an AH? That's pretty shitty.", "Your husband and stepson should go on the trip together, and you should stay behind with your spoiled brat of a son. That is what would be fair. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nTell me you are a step mom without calling yourself that. Jeez. Btw your husband sucks too.", "YTA and blatantly favouring your son over your stepson.   You also seem like you look down on your stepson for not being as social and popular as your son.", "No. It's the best solution for you. Certainly not the best solution for everyone. You choose your son over step son. YTA", "YTA", "YTA. You're punishing your stepson for your son's behaviour. If you can't see how awful that makes you then you're beyond help.", "YTA. Turning your son into an entitled little brat by allowing his temper tantrums to ruin things for his step brother. Seriously. He is 16. It was a trip to Disney, does he even understand how many people never get such an opportunity? And fine, want to leave him home, do so. Stepson should have been given the option to invite a friend or family member (shocker but we introverts do have friends..) or to go himself. This was sad, borderline abusive, and entitled. Your poor stepson.", "So stepson isn't good enough to be worthy of a Disney trip but he's good enough to stay home and babysit your teenage brat?

Yikes. Your husband isn\u2019t \u201cused to having a kid with friends\u201d?", "A romantic trip to Disneyland.  Hahaha. YTA \nYour son throws a tantrum and gets his way.  Your stepson is rightfully sad, and he's a whiner. You are not very nice. I hope your husband sees you for what you are", "YTA and a bad parent and your husband is a worse one. Cruel is the term I would use to describe taking away a trip from a kid to watch his misbehaving and bratty stepbrother.

You have such a condescending attitude regarding your stepson! It doesn't seem like you like him at all - what just because he has a different lifestyle than you?? No wonder your son is so spoilt, he probably picked up on many of his childish/immature habits from you. \n\nYou honestly owe him a trip he can take solo, without his unkind stepmom and dad.", "yta", "YTA, you are punishing your stepson for your bio-son's bad behavior.", "YTA. Your stepson doesn't want to stay home and babysit your son. Which is what you are asking of him. He shouldn't be responsible for monitoring the behavior of his similarly-aged step-sibling. \n\nYour son threw a fit and instead of telling him he was going or arranging for someone else to stay with him you punished your stepson by taking the trip away from him.", "YTA.  Your teenage son threw a tantrum and you caved. You took a trip away from step son because he's not worth taking? Wtf!\n\nAnd now stepson doesn't get to go.

Time to grow a fucking spine and parent your child. YTA.", "Holy shit your a massive dick. You ruined a kid\u2019s happiness, and crushed his excitement over something that would get him out and about. Then not only asked him to be a parent to his brother and keep an eye on him, but then asked that your son invite him to be social like he would have been on the trip. How the fuck do you think this is the best solution\u2026.", "YTA - yeah the family dynamics here are tough. But essentially you let your teens sons temper tantrum keep your step son from doing something he really wanted to. How is he going to feel about that? Your son wins and he loses. Now he has to babysit his brother who runs things. \n\nBeing an introvert with few friends is totally healthy. Going on a long trip with his dad and step-mom may have been a really great moment for all of you..m but nope. No Disney magic here.", "yta so because your son doesn\u2019t want to go, you don\u2019t let your stepson go either. What if it was the other way around.

Doesn\u2019t have much going on in his life & has no friends, huh? So when your son acts up like a spoiled brat, you reward his behavior by letting him stay home & you punish your stepson taking away something you promised him & he was excited about. \n\nWell enjoy this first anniversary trip because if your husband has any kind of backbone & a half decent father, this will be your last anniversary.", "100% YTA\n\nall I read is, my stepson isn't as popular & social & not as fun to be with at Disney, so I uninvited him because my bio son is not going.\n\nYour husband is TA too for not sticking up for his child.", "YTA. This post reminds me of the situations at school whereby a minority of kids in a class would misbehave but the entire class would get detention even if most people didn't misbehave at all- this is collective punishment and is unfair. \n\nYou got your stepson's hopes up by bringing up the Disneyworld trip to him, and uninvited him solely because your son didn't want to go. Why should your stepson, who sounds like a good kid, miss out when you had initially wanted him there regardless? If you don't trust your own son's behaviours, then you should've either left him with another adult family member, or insist he comes along anyway. Why should a 17 year old be expected to be the childcare provider of someone else's child, when he is still a child himself?", "YTA Because your son started acting like a brat, you decided to punish your stepson.

How on earth is that fair, reasonable or good parenting?", "YTA - The solution would have to make your son go on the trip\u2026not the other way around.

Our kids are close in age but have vey different personalities. My son (16M) is an extrovert, has a very active social life and does a lot of activities. My stepson (17M) is an introvert that prefers to stay home and does not have much going on in his life outside of school. They still have a good relationship, even playing videogames together sometimes. \n\nMy son was not on board with the DisneyWorld idea at all. He had not interest in doing this kind of trip with his family and was specially upset because it would make him miss his current girlfriend's birthday. He was really angry about the situation, yelling at me multiple times demanding to stay at home instead of going to the trip and accusing us of ruinning his life. On the other hand, my stepson was really excited about the trip.\n\nMy husband is used to having a kid with no friends when doing plans like this so he didn't expect my son's reaction. I felt that going just with my stepson would be anticlimactic and wouldn't fulfill the original idea of it being a trip for the whole family. I also didn't want to leave my son fully alone with all the house to himself. We decided to leave them both so my stepson can keep an eye on my son's behaviour while me and my husband have a romantic trip just for the two of us.\n\nMy stepson is sad because he wanted to go to the trip but my son is happy about the new plan. My stepson was more intense about his disappointment at first, crying and whining a lot, but he has mostly calm down by now. I asked my son to try to include his stepbrother a little in his social life while we are out so he wouldn't be so lonely and he said he would try to. My husband feels bad for his son being sad but I am convinced this is the best solution for everyone.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Honestly, if my daughter acted like that I would tell her she was showing me why she was not mature enough to stay home without us. Your stepson should not be forced to stay home.  He was looking forward to the trip and should get to go.

You knew your own child and you should\u2019ve said I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work for my kid.\n\nAlso, the way you talk about your stepson just is losing with implied judgment that he\u2019s not as cool as your son. And he\u2019s not doing as much as your son. I bet he does a lot more than you know he does. Because you probably don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to him just from the way you describe him versus describing your own son. And both apparently seem to live with you most of the time.", "Because your son was a brat you punished your stepson. Of course YTA!\n\n\"I am convinced this is the best solution for everyone.\" How is it the best solution for your stepson?", "YTA", "Maybe your stepson isn't an introvert and just doesn't like his garbage stepmom that treats him like a babysitter and a second class son? Ever thought of that?", "YTA -and so is your kid! Your poor step-son.", "your child is a crybaby", "Whoa. \n\nYTA\n\nLike a huge one.", "So, you punished your stepson because your bio son cracked the sads?\n\nYta", "Yta \nYour step son is not a babysitter. He dont have to be a colateral damage of your son reaction\u2026", "Definitely the ah here. I hope your totally okay with ruining the relationship you have with your stepson. Your hubby is also the ah for letting you do that to his son. You are literally punishing the one kid cause the other kid threw a tantrum. I use the term \"kid\" lightly seeing as their almost adults.. Your son must be super entitled to think that going on vacation is going to \"ruin his life\". But hey, you raised that right? Take the whole family on the trip as you originally planned.", "If I was your step son I'd be so angry at everyone especially your real son when you're gone we would most likely end up fist fighting. I hope you think about that while on your trip leave your angry step son home with your whiny brat son, you don't think they will say some words to one another? Could escalate I hope not, fighting isn't ok.", "YTA. You sound like an evil step mother from cartoons, it's almost hilarious if it wasn't so sad for your step son.", "You are SOOOO the asshole . YTA", "YTA. Your kid acts out so he gets his own way and your stepson is punished in order to make it happen.  You do know that your extrovert son is going to make this kid\u2019s life miserable, take advantage of him and wreck your house.  And then you\u2019ll no doubt blame your stepson for not \u2018supervising\u2019 him.", "YTA", "Boooooooo \ud83c\udf45\ud83c\udf45\ud83c\udf45 your stepson should go with friends and you can stay home to watch your unruly high school aged toddler.

Shit parenting at its best.", "So when your son whines and cries it's not a tantrum. Lol and you think your step son can stop your son from doing what exactly? Currently he's mad at you so he's extra not going to care to help you. \nYta", "YTA - your son throws a fit so he gets what he wants. Your stepson is upset and he\u2019s told just to get over it oh and by the way to babysit his stepbrother. Either the family goes or everyone stays home.", "YTA- to me this reads as follows \u201cI don\u2019t like my stepson cause he isn\u2019t like my son so why should I spend time with him if my son doesn\u2019t want to babysit him so I can do what I want?\u201d You suck as a stepmom.", "YTA. Wow! The fact that you call him whiny says so many awful things about you as a parent, step or otherwise. And it isn\u2019t his job to babysit your kid.", "WTF did I just read?  You literally offered a child something and then pulled it away from them!  Is this even real???? YTA, YTA, YTA.  Your SON is behaving like a total twit and you're punishing your stepson for it.  I am flabbergasted.", "YTA. You let a 16 year old decide for your stepson and change the plan the \u201cparents\u201d had. You are letting him make decisions he shouldn\u2019t be at his age. \nI have twin 16 year olds, and my oldest is 20. I know from experience you caved on this, he now know he is capable of having you cave on many more things, and can change events not only for himself if they inconvenience him, but for your entire family. There were other ways to make it work. \nMy mom sent me on a bad kids hike 1.5 months before my 18th birthday. She didn\u2019t like my boyfriend so that\u2019s why she sent me on it. I was the only kid not addicted to something. I hated her at that moment for it. It was a \u201csurprise\u201d for my graduating and birthday she told me. I missed my best friends wedding I was supposed to be the maid of honor in (that bad boyfriends older sister) and my then boyfriends 18th birthday, instead got 3 weeks in a wilderness camp/hike with no communication from the outside world. I got over it. Wasn\u2019t angry at her when I returned. This was much worse than having to go to Disneyland", "Total AH.  Take one and leave the other behind.  But as he did not want to go do not make it up to him with a different trip or gifts.", "YTA. You can stay home and stepson and hubby can have a vacation together", "Your husband and his son should go on the trip and you should stay home and watch your kid.  Win/win.  \n\nAnd you\u2019re the asshole.", "Big YTA!", "YTA. It\u2019s a family trip. He will survive missing his gf bday, and any high school gf would totally understand that a family trip takes precedence. Why are you letting your son control the family? Please don\u2019t raise a man like that.", "Why would you cancel the kid who was interested in your silly Disneyland vacation? Omg YTA. Big time. And your kid is spoiled too", "YTA omg what the fuck is your problem, I don\u2019t know why you wanna go to Disney when you\u2019re the real life Evil Stepmother.", "YTA - Fulfilling the stereotypical mean old stepmother. You are so heartless. \nWow. Sorry for your stepson that he doesn't even have a dad that will stand up to you. Sounds like he tried but you shot him down.", "Couldn't even make it a full year without becoming evil stepmother.  YTA.", "WOW. YTA!!! The fact you're asking is shocking. Come on!", "YTA - Nice step mom move there", "YTA majorly here. Your son is throwing a temper tantrum and not only do you give in but you punish your step son who was so excited and appreciative to go on a trip with family. He will remember this forever and it will definitely tarnish his view of you and his dad and also your son. Your son was throwing the fit, send him to a relatives and go bond with your husband and step son, maybe your son will be more appreciative in the future.", "YTA. You\u2019re punishing your stepson because of your son\u2019s behaviour. In no world does this make any sense.", "Y are an entire A - pinning the stepson's trip, and ultimately his punishment in not going, on the whim of the son is contemptible.", "YTA. \n\nDo you even care about your stepson? Also your son sounds like a spoiled brat.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA the biggest AH is the dead beat dad . What a pathetic loser- feel bad for his son. He deserves better", "YTA", "YTA along with your husband and your son. The only one that isn\u2019t is your poor stepson.", "YTA - you punished your stepson because your son is an entitled AH", "YTA. What a bad decision. Why can\u2019t you just get someone to stay with your son and let stepson enjoy the trip? What are you trying to accomplish here?", "It's not the best solution or everyone, this is the best solution for your son. Yes, major asshole", "YTA. Even as a 28 year old, if someone promised me a trip to DisneyWorld and then backed out of it I'd throw a tantrum too.", "YTA please, please don't punish your stepson for your son's behavior/choice.", "Wow. YTA and awful. You made your stepson cry. Heartless.", "YTA\n\nYOU don\u2019t trust YOUR son, why is it stepson problem?\n\nAnd your husband is AH as well for agreeing with this bs.", "Wait, you stopped your stepson from going on a trip that he wanted to go on,that HIS father paid for, so he could look after YOUR son? \n\nPlease explain how you could NOT be the asshole here!\n\nYTA", "YTA. Favorism much? Why is your stepson being punished for your son being a brat. He's an introvert means he must be really excited for this trip and you crushed it because it would be \"anti-climactic\" TF? Also your husband is also an asshole who's letting his wife of 1 year treating his 17 yr old child like shit. You fit the bill of step parent stereotype really well.", "Definitely the asshole wtf, your son should go to his dads or another family member\u2019s house. Id 1000% just take my son and leave you behind if i was your husband, absolutely fuking not just because your son doesnt wanna have fun, we are a whole ass family with or with your son, step son shouldn\u2019t even be considered step son, that\u2019s your 2 son like your son is your husbands second son\u2026 the actual fuck is your issue", "YTA YTA YTA. I hope you fix this immediately and take that poor boy with you on vacation.", "not just punished. she couldn\u2019t parent her son so she\u2019s making her stepson parent him(keeping an eye on his behavior). you know you put your stepson in a lose lose situation. WHEN your son misbehaves your stepson either tells you, making your son mad at him and hurt their relationship or to not tell you and of course you\u2019ll blame him for not stopping it and reporting to you.", "It\u2019s so freaking needlessly stupid and cruel, too. The solution was *right there*. One doesn\u2019t want to, one does. Were we worried about not getting fun pics for the \u2018gram because stepson\u2019s not outgoing? Like how does this even work?", "Not only that, she basically rewarded her son acting like a spoiled brat. \n\nI'm surprised the Dad didn't advocate for his son, but judging by the reaction of that kid - maybe he's used to being disregarded. Poor kid", "Agree. What is this??  YTA for sure. If this is a real post, this is terrible.", "Majorly", "Is there a no filter aita sub where we can actually tell people how we feel about them without getting banned? I want one. Sometimes these people deserve it.", "Her son is spoiled brat and she\u2019s made him that way.

But no, it\u2019s your son who\u2019s an ungrateful brat and the only thing your stepson did to warrant having his dream trip snatched away was\u2026 (checks notes)\u2026. Being a decent human being who you now expect to do your job and parent your own kid?\nHere\u2019s an idea\u2026 Dad and Stepson go to Disney. You and your entitled brat stay home.

All carrot, no stick.", "Man she\u2019s the asshole, the son isn\u2019t in the wrong here. He\u2019s a teenager, dragging him to Disney world isn\u2019t reasonable at all.

When the shy introvert who doesn't have much going on outside of school actually shows excitement and you take that excitement and say to them \"silly you for showing interest in something now go babysit your older step brother\". \n\nYta op. You taught your introverted step son to likely show even less of an interest in something you'll do in the future.", "They\u2019re only a year apart in age too.
