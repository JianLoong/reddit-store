Our kids are close in age but have vey different personalities. My son (16M) is an extrovert, has a very active social life and does a lot of activities. My stepson (17M) is an introvert that prefers to stay home and does not have much going on in his life outside of school. They still have a good relationship, even playing videogames together sometimes. \n\nMy son was not on board with the DisneyWorld idea at all. He had not interest in doing this kind of trip with his family and was specially upset because it would make him miss his current girlfriend's birthday. He was really angry about the situation, yelling at me multiple times demanding to stay at home instead of going to the trip and accusing us of ruinning his life. On the other hand, my stepson was really excited about the trip.\n\nMy husband is used to having a kid with no friends when doing plans like this so he didn't expect my son's reaction. I felt that going just with my stepson would be anticlimactic and wouldn't fulfill the original idea of it being a trip for the whole family. I also didn't want to leave my son fully alone with all the house to himself. We decided to leave them both so my stepson can keep an eye on my son's behaviour while me and my husband have a romantic trip just for the two of us.\n\nMy stepson is sad because he wanted to go to the trip but my son is happy about the new plan. My stepson was more intense about his disappointment at first, crying and whining a lot, but he has mostly calm down by now. I asked my son to try to include his stepbrother a little in his social life while we are out so he wouldn't be so lonely and he said he would try to. My husband feels bad for his son being sad but I am convinced this is the best solution for everyone.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1682979733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13537ar/aita_for_uninviting_my_stepson_from_our/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How is this the \"best solution\"? If you\u2019re worried about your son's behavior while you\u2019re gone, hire a babysitter (even though he is too old for that and should be responsible to be home alone) instead of forcing that role onto your step-son or consider that his behavior is due to your parenting OP\n\nInstead of letting your son's behavior slide and punishing your step-son because of his behavior; you should properly discipline your child and not enable his horrible behavior.\n\nYour husband is also an AH for letting you do this to his son.

You're not just depriving the 17yo of a trip he really wanted to go on, but you're making him responsible for monitoring your 16yo while you and your husband get to have a romantic getaway? \n\nYour stepson did nothing wrong and doesn't deserve to have the trip taken away from him. He was enthusiastic and looking forward to the trip.

Your son manipulated you into leaving him home, so to make it easier on yourself you\u2019re punishing your stepson by dis-inviting him? So your stepson bears the brunt if your bad parenting choices?

YTA big time. You\u2019re like one of those evil stepmothers. I won\u2019t be surprised if your stepson will go NC to both you and your husband.

It makes sense that your own son is an entitled brat.", "Poor step son \nThe only way for him to get heard would be to act like an entitled brat like your son. \n\nHe was clearly excited but because the king decided he didn\u2019t want to go and obviously he isn\u2019t not well behaved, you are using your stepson as a mental crutch. \n\nJust go the 3 of you. (Or force your son to come. I don\u2019t see why you changed your plans just for him and made your step son suffer as the same time). \n\n3 people is still a family.

It sounds like the root of the problem here is that you don't trust your son to be on his own while the rest of you are on your trip.  That's a problem, but it's something to be worked out between you and him.  Your stepson doesn't need to be punished for it.  If someone has to stay and supervise your son, you or your husband should, not him.", "YTA - Evil stepmom vibes. Do better. Gross.", "YTA and so is your husband for letting you do this to his son.", "YTA - seems like the problem is your son, why should the step son that did want to go suffer because of someone else's tantrum? It is not the best solution for your step son, it is the best solution for you and you alone.", "YTA. \n\nNice of you to put yours and your son\u2019s desires first.

You are punishing your stepson by taking away a vacation you already told him he was going on, when your son is the one being a dick. You said your stepson is an introvert, but that doesnt mean he doesn\u2019t have any friends, right? Let him bring a friend along instead, and make your son stay with a family member if you don\u2019t want him left alone.", "YTA.  Your kid has a fit  and gets to stay home,  so you make stepson stay home also?\nYou and your husband are both assholes", "YTA. Your son pitched a fit like a toddler so you punished your stepson to appease him? Of course YTA. The fact that your 16 year old can\u2019t figure out how to behave like a mature human being is not your stepson\u2019s fault- I\u2019m pretty sure if the roles were reversed you\u2019d be pissed your stepson was unhappy, yet you don\u2019t seem at all concerned that your own child is whining like a four year old. Your blatant favoritism is astounding.", "Yes, YTA. You had one son that was actually looking forward to this trip and another not. You should haven't uninvited the one that actually wanted to go....make it up to him by inviting him again and admitting your faults. \n\nDon't punish him bc your other son didn't want to go.", "YTA. Your stepson wanted to spend time with you...and you didn't want to spend time with him.\n\nI hope you see Cinderella in Disneyland; you're exactly the Evil Stepmom. You have a stepson and are making him work instead of spending time together as a family. YTA big time on this one.", "YTA.  Should have made your son go on the trip.  Stepson got punished because your son had a little tantrum because no doubt his high school girlfriend has been whining about her birthday and can't have him go away for a few days.  Your son won't be inviting him anywhere - your son will be with his girlfriend the whole time.  And you know it. Even the way you described the stepson as 'crying and whining' when its exactly what your kid did only you made him sound less like a child.", "YTA. Are there any family or friends in the area that can keep your son.  Giving into on. And basically, punishing the other by making the stepson stay home to babysit.", "YTA.", "Wow. Yes, YTA.\n\nWhy refer to your stepson as acting like a baby, when your own son did the same?", "YTA, and wtf? If your son don't want to go, then ok, don't force him I guess. He's 16, old enough to stay alone at home without a babysitter.\n\nBut come on, why are you punishing your stepson? And why is your husband ok with that? It's family even if your son isn't here. Your stepson is family too. Don't punish him because your son don't want to go, and APOLOGIZE, please.\n\nAnd for real, what's wrong with your kid? He can yell and throw a tantrum and accuse you of ruining his life because *he's going to Disneyland*? And you're not punishing him? He should be the one being punished lol, not your stepson.", "YTA, you invited him and because he wants to go and your son doesn't you're going to not take him? In what world does that make sense?\n\nIf you're annoyed your son doesn't want to go, that's no reason to punish step son.\n\nIf your son wouldn't enjoy it, that's no reason to punish step son. \n\nI could go on but the fact is, your son wants to spend time with his girlfriend. Your step son is excited and you're considering that step son can't come because your son doesn't want to go. \n\nHe has done nothing wrong. If your husband goes with you and without his son, he's a horrible father. For even considering asking, you're a horrible mother for raising a brat and a sad excuse for a step mother.", "YTA. Why are you punishing your step-son for your son being an AH? That's pretty shitty.", "Your husband and stepson should go on the trip together, and you should stay behind with your spoiled brat of a son. That is what would be fair. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nTell me you are a step mom without calling yourself that. Jeez. Btw your husband sucks too.", "YTA and blatantly favouring your son over your stepson.   You also seem like you look down on your stepson for not being as social and popular as your son.", "No. It's the best solution for you. Certainly not the best solution for everyone. You choose your son over step son. YTA", "YTA", "YTA. You're punishing your stepson for your son's behaviour. If you can't see how awful that makes you then you're beyond help.", "YTA. Turning your son into an entitled little brat by allowing his temper tantrums to ruin things for his step brother. Seriously. He is 16. It was a trip to Disney, does he even understand how many people never get such an opportunity? And fine, want to leave him home, do so. Stepson should have been given the option to invite a friend or family member (shocker but we introverts do have friends..) or to go himself. This was sad, borderline abusive, and entitled. Your poor stepson.", "So stepson isn't good enough to be worthy of a Disney trip but he's good enough to stay home and babysit your teenage brat?

Yikes. Your husband isn\u2019t \u201cused to having a kid with friends\u201d?", "A romantic trip to Disneyland.  Hahaha. YTA \nYour son throws a tantrum and gets his way.  Your stepson is rightfully sad, and he's a whiner. You are not very nice. I hope your husband sees you for what you are", "YTA and a bad parent and your husband is a worse one. Cruel is the term I would use to describe taking away a trip from a kid to watch his misbehaving and bratty stepbrother.

You have such a condescending attitude regarding your stepson! It doesn't seem like you like him at all - what just because he has a different lifestyle than you?? No wonder your son is so spoilt, he probably picked up on many of his childish/immature habits from you. \n\nYou honestly owe him a trip he can take solo, without his unkind stepmom and dad.", "yta", "YTA, you are punishing your stepson for your bio-son's bad behavior.", "YTA. Your stepson doesn't want to stay home and babysit your son. Which is what you are asking of him. He shouldn't be responsible for monitoring the behavior of his similarly-aged step-sibling. \n\nYour son threw a fit and instead of telling him he was going or arranging for someone else to stay with him you punished your stepson by taking the trip away from him.", "YTA.  Your teenage son threw a tantrum and you caved. You took a trip away from step son because he's not worth taking? Wtf!\n\nAnd now stepson doesn't get to go.

Time to grow a fucking spine and parent your child. YTA.", "Holy shit your a massive dick. You ruined a kid\u2019s happiness, and crushed his excitement over something that would get him out and about. Then not only asked him to be a parent to his brother and keep an eye on him, but then asked that your son invite him to be social like he would have been on the trip. How the fuck do you think this is the best solution\u2026.", "YTA - yeah the family dynamics here are tough. But essentially you let your teens sons temper tantrum keep your step son from doing something he really wanted to. How is he going to feel about that? Your son wins and he loses. Now he has to babysit his brother who runs things. \n\nBeing an introvert with few friends is totally healthy. Going on a long trip with his dad and step-mom may have been a really great moment for all of you..m but nope. No Disney magic here.", "yta so because your son doesn\u2019t want to go, you don\u2019t let your stepson go either. What if it was the other way around.

Doesn\u2019t have much going on in his life & has no friends, huh? So when your son acts up like a spoiled brat, you reward his behavior by letting him stay home & you punish your stepson taking away something you promised him & he was excited about. \n\nWell enjoy this first anniversary trip because if your husband has any kind of backbone & a half decent father, this will be your last anniversary.", "100% YTA\n\nall I read is, my stepson isn't as popular & social & not as fun to be with at Disney, so I uninvited him because my bio son is not going.\n\nYour husband is TA too for not sticking up for his child.", "YTA. This post reminds me of the situations at school whereby a minority of kids in a class would misbehave but the entire class would get detention even if most people didn't misbehave at all- this is collective punishment and is unfair. \n\nYou got your stepson's hopes up by bringing up the Disneyworld trip to him, and uninvited him solely because your son didn't want to go. Why should your stepson, who sounds like a good kid, miss out when you had initially wanted him there regardless? If you don't trust your own son's behaviours, then you should've either left him with another adult family member, or insist he comes along anyway. Why should a 17 year old be expected to be the childcare provider of someone else's child, when he is still a child himself?", "YTA Because your son started acting like a brat, you decided to punish your stepson. That's ridiculous and you should know that", "YTA and the husband, for giving in to you punishing step son for your sons behavior. You need to do better, evil step mom.

Do you always give him what he wants after he screams at you?", "Omg YTA. \n\nSo, your son throws a hissy fit and behaves badly, and you essentially reward him by giving in and giving him what he wants. Your stepson, on the other hand, was actually excited and wanted to spend family time, and he gets his trip cancelled to placate your son? How on earth is that fair, reasonable or good parenting?", "YTA - The solution would have to make your son go on the trip\u2026not the other way around.

Our kids are close in age but have vey different personalities. My son (16M) is an extrovert, has a very active social life and does a lot of activities. My stepson (17M) is an introvert that prefers to stay home and does not have much going on in his life outside of school. They still have a good relationship, even playing videogames together sometimes. \n\nMy son was not on board with the DisneyWorld idea at all. He had not interest in doing this kind of trip with his family and was specially upset because it would make him miss his current girlfriend's birthday. He was really angry about the situation, yelling at me multiple times demanding to stay at home instead of going to the trip and accusing us of ruinning his life. On the other hand, my stepson was really excited about the trip.\n\nMy husband is used to having a kid with no friends when doing plans like this so he didn't expect my son's reaction. I felt that going just with my stepson would be anticlimactic and wouldn't fulfill the original idea of it being a trip for the whole family. I also didn't want to leave my son fully alone with all the house to himself. We decided to leave them both so my stepson can keep an eye on my son's behaviour while me and my husband have a romantic trip just for the two of us.\n\nMy stepson is sad because he wanted to go to the trip but my son is happy about the new plan. My stepson was more intense about his disappointment at first, crying and whining a lot, but he has mostly calm down by now. I asked my son to try to include his stepbrother a little in his social life while we are out so he wouldn't be so lonely and he said he would try to. My husband feels bad for his son being sad but I am convinced this is the best solution for everyone.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Honestly, if my daughter acted like that I would tell her she was showing me why she was not mature enough to stay home without us. Your stepson should not be forced to stay home.  He was looking forward to the trip and should get to go.

Both you and your husband. Your son\u2019s decision should not effect your stepson\u2019s opportunity to go on the trip. Just say you like your son more than your stepson since your solution really screws over your stepson. Going to Disney World is not the same as staying home with your step brother. Did you even offer a reward or something to your stepson for staying home?", "YTA ah yes punish your stepson because your son is as spoiled as you are. SMH", "YTA you\u2019re punishing your step son because your own son\u2019s a brat, then you make him \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on him!", "YTA", "U can\u2019t be this dense ! Is ur step son ur sons baby sitter? Be so ffr \ud83d\ude11 poor kid ! Ur husband needs to grow a back bone n stand up for his son .", "YTA\n\nYour stepson is going to feel like a babysitter now. If you wanted someone to look after your son you should have picked a family member or trusted friend to either stay with him or check on him at key intervals. Or he could have had an awesome time staying at a friend's house (assuming the parents were open to the idea).", "My favorite was \"so my stepson can keep an eye on my son.\" Ridiculous and stupid logic. If she can't trust her son, she needs to hire him a babysitter.... not punish her stepson.", "True. You are such a selfish personOp. All i read was if my son cannot go my stepson shouldnt be going and having fun. OP's husband is even a bigger AH than you because he is not thinking about his son at all.\nYTA", "Dude this is horrible. Your son is entitled and so are you. Your son has friends now at 16 but if you\u2019re an adult leaning on your son\u2019s popularity for kudos as a parent I can only imagine his adulthood will fall short. Your husband is pathetic too for allowing your unkindness to his son. Seriously what kind of adult are you for being so hung up on a child not having many friends that you have no respect for them? Wtf? YTA", "Yes, totally the AH!  You\u2019re punishing your stepson because you allow your son to throw a temper tantrum and get his way.", "Well, she\u2019s going to Disney after all", "Oh that fits the situation well. Just think poor step kid. \n\nThink op took parenting lessons from the Brother Grimm", "And punishes the other kid for it instead!", "So her son is going to essentially have the house to himself on his girlfriend's birthday. \n\nWhat could possibly go wrong.", "I don\u2019t think her stepson counts as \u201canyone\u201d or part of \u201ceveryone\u201d to her.  Poor kid. \ud83d\ude15", "Hes not people.", "You know - leaving the son at home and taking the stepson, which would make both kids happy - was no good because it didn\u2019t fit the plan of doing things as an entire family. So instead leave both kids behind! Perfect!  YTA", "I hope he throws a Sixteen Candles party.", "One step brother doesn't appreciate the gift so OP also took it from the grateful step brother.\n\nOP, YTA. You could have left your son home and taken your stepson. You could have rescheduled the trip so it fit with your son's schedule. Instead, you take something treasured from your stepson, and then come here and insult him. YTA to the max.", "I hope the stepson realizes later on that OP isn't worth his love.", "Yes\n\nyta", "I think the root is that OP has had 16 years to not turn her child into Dudley Durnsley and failed miserably.", "I'm not OP. I usually hate when people use \"Do Better\". But not in this case. You are spot on! This Mom definitely needs to do better!", "The Dad won't. Going against OP would cause issues and now OP gets a *romantic* vacation instead of a family trip.\n\nHe already chose when he agreed his son should stay behind.\n\nOP, YTA. Be a better stepmom.", "This is a perfect solution. She created the monster, she should have to deal with it.", "She\u2019s obviously making moves to get what she wants. Son to be golden child and step son to disappear. So she can have her perfect family. She\u2019s VERY obviously making sure her husbands son will go nc with his father. And be out of the happy little family she actually wants. Dads the biggest AH for allowing his son to be treated so poorly.", "No, leave spoiled brat son home with grandparents or other adult and let stepson enjoy the trip. No one wants to drag a petulant teenager on a trip that's supposed to be fun.", "Disagree.

And also gf's birthday is on those days. \nMake whatever you like guys...\nPlus YTA, poor kid ss", "Or just cancel the whole trip.

OP clearly is prioritizing her son to her step son.", "But OP isn\u2019t trying to do the right thing and isn\u2019t being fair", "So if someone was *trying* to save a kid from dying of thirst by drowning them then you'd not call that person an asshole?

Seems unlikely, but I'd consider the possibility. Sometimes people do their best & it leads to real tragedies, and in those cases I think it's horrible to pile on. \n\nAs I mention in another comment \"either both of you get the thing or neither of you gets the thing\" is a valid parenting strategy when spending money on siblings. It's not inherently a mean or evil rule, even though the application of it here is particularly awful. \n\nIt looks like the consensus here is overwhelmingly that the OP is an asshole, and I'm both unsurprised and at peace with that.", "I think you are wrong. In this case, both boys were originally given the option of going on the vacation. So the gift/benefit was equally offered. \n\nThen one son got to make the decision for both of them, and the other son, who wanted to go, was given the task of \u201cwatching over him.\u201d \n\nSo basically, sorry, you can\u2019t come anymore. Also, can you make sure your step-brother doesn\u2019t party too hard and mess up the house? \n\nThat\u2019s incredibly unfair."]}
