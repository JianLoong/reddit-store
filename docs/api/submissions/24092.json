Oftentimes he falls asleep after getting home and doing the rest of his share of the housework and spending time with the kids.

Yesterday afternoon I dropped the kids off with my parents and I was venting to them about it.

There are also times where my husband will ask me to make an extra egg wrap, slice of danish etc. for \u201cthe boys\u201d because their days started earlier or they forgot to bring something. I do this because it makes me happy-not because my husband treats me poorly or expects it from me. I enjoy providing in my own way! If you don\u2019t, great-that\u2019s your choice and your marriage.
