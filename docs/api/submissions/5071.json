Fake names.\n\nI\u2019m currently 10 weeks pregnant and my biggest pregnancy issue is fatigue and, mainly, cravings and hunger.  No matter what I do, I cannot seem to stay full.  I eat all day but have managed to still lose 3 pounds.\n\nProblem is we don\u2019t always have what I want.  So a few times a week, I stop at the store on my way home from work and stock up on my favorite snacks.  Pizza, pickles, fruit (especially oranges, grapes and watermelon), popcorn, chicken noodle soup, string cheese, etc.  I\u2019ve been doing this since maybe about 5 weeks.\n\nBut every time I check the fridge, almost all my snacks are gone.  I keep telling Paul to stop eating my food and he says that it\u2019s not a big deal and I can just get more.  But the at involves me (not him) stopping at the store more and me (again, not him) spending more of my money.\n\nLast week, I just snapped.  I had bought my favorite ice cream: Neapolitan.  I put it in the freezer and decided to take a nap before writing a paper (I\u2019m currently getting my masters).  I planned to have a bowl when I woke up and began working on it.\n\nWhen I woke up, I went to freezer and saw it had been opened.   Now, I can\u2019t eat an entire quart of ice cream all by myself, so I wasn\u2019t mad that he had some until I saw what he did to it.  My husband ate all of the strawberry side and left me with just the vanilla and chocolate.  And the strawberry is my favorite part.\n\nI got mad and started yelling at him.  He told me it was unreasonable of me to bring food in the house and not expect him to have any of it. But I told him that wasn\u2019t what I expected but he knew that was my favorite ice cream and my favorite part of it was all gone and he\u2019s always eating my snacksl.  He just told me run to the store and get some more.  So I just went back upstairs because he wasn\u2019t listening.  \n\nI opened my laptop and ordered a full sized fridge ($2300), paid for from my personal savings account that he has never contributed to.  My husband and I don\u2019t mingle our accounts together so he never saw I bought it until two days ago when it was delivered to our house.  He came home from work and saw it plugged in our garage.  \n\nHe asked why there were locks on it and how much it cost.  I told him not worry how much it cost and there\u2019re locks on it to make sure he doesn\u2019t eat all my snacks for my cravings.  He said I can\u2019t control what he eats, and I told him not.  I\u2019m just controlling who eats my snacks but the fridge in the house is open and he can have whatever is in that and the cabinets, but the fridge in the garage is for me only.\n\nI haven\u2019t had to go to the store at all this weekend and all my food is locked up, but Paul is not speaking to me for two reasons:  for making a large purchase without talking to him first and for \u201cturning food into a war\u201d (his words).\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: FYI, this is the only issue we\u2019re having by right now.  We\u2019ve been married 2 years.\n\nEdit 2:  Also, I got a full size instead of a mini because ours in the kitchen is kinda old and I figured it could replace it should it go out.

You have every right to be annoyed and frustrated that he has no respect for you concerning food.\n\nWhat bothers me is that after eating your food, he tells *you* to go out and buy more. That is some nerve. Why doesn't he go out himself and replace the food he took? He sounds extraordinarily selfish. \n\nUnless he is willing to have some kind of couples counseling, I'm afraid he will keep behaving this way even after the baby arrives.", "NTA, I had a friend who had to do something similar because her husband wouldn't stop eating the lunches she made for herself for work.

You know that abusers often wait until they believe their victims are trapped before letting loose? Sometimes it's living together, sometimes marriage and very often pregnancy. He's taking things away from you, and forcing (trying anyway) you to fix the problem. Sounds like he resents being put second to the baby, and is acting out because he too, is a giant baby.\n\nYou can tell because he fucked up the ice cream. If he was just eating it, he wouldn't have carved out your favorite part, just for himself. He's the one that started the war, you just called his bluff. I hope you are very careful about how you proceed with this relationship if you can't beat to the bottom of this. People who fuck with food are very dangerous. Whether it's tampering, forcing, withholding, stealing, it's all messing with the fundamentals of life. It's not just that he's eating, he's saying *you* are responsible, *you* need to fix it. And *you* need to do the fixing *his way*. *You* need to scurry around and buy more. *You* can't buy some device that will secure your food, that's against the rules of war!\n\nSeriously though.

And if you don't need it in the future, it isn't like you can't sell it. \nHe caused the issues when it comes to the food by not being considerate for the fact that your in school AND pregnant and therefore don't have the extra time to just run out and grab more every time he eats it all. \nMaybe start eating all his snacks before he gets to them if he keeps wanting to make a big deal of it - but that's just me being petty.", "NTA ignore this ice cream terrorist.", "NTA \n\nPaul continually disregards the food YOU buy. it\u2019s not even like you haven\u2019t communicated, you have. you\u2019ve done what you\u2019re supposed to. \n\nyou were clear with your boundaries, you communicated them, he violated them, now there are consequences.", "Best way I can think of this is that you bought a $2300 band aid to slap on a stab wound.

Like, really pressed for answers? I've heard some guys experience sympathy symptoms and begin eating just as much food when their SO is pregnant, and he might be embarrassed or doesn't understand it. It's definitely no OK for him to do this and it could cause issues down the line if there's not proper communication.\n\nYou'll want to talk with him and see if you can figure out what is happening in a way that prevents a build up of resentment/future issues.\n\nIf it really is sympathy symptoms, he can just replace snack with double the amount and enjoy them with you while you prepare for your new squishy addition to the family. I do hope this gets resolved, and don't listen to some of the other commenters. Yes, it's not a great situation, but that doesn't mean considering divorce just yet. Try some marriage troubleshooting first. \n\nAlso, good luck on your masters!", "NTA - hubby is being pretty inconsiderate. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t realize how exhausting it is to be you right now. You\u2019re expending so much energy that you\u2019re losing weight. I understand why you yelled and bought the fridge, but someone needs to tell hubby that you are being drained and you need WAY more support. Because it\u2019s not going to get easier from here. Some would say the pregnancy is the easiest part.

Definitely worth keeping it separate from the main fridge!", "NTA. I literally laughed out loud reading the \"he asked me why there were locks on it\" hahaha This was an amazing solution OP, but I'm really sad for you that your husband is being such a AH...especially while you're pregnant.", "NTA, it was your money, you can spend it on whatever you like.\n\nAnd he should learn that if he eats something, **he** has to replace it, not just you always running off to the store.\n\nThis isn't even a pregnancy thing, this is a basic manners thing.", "NTA. He said it is unreasonable for him not to have \u201csome\u201d of the food. That is true - but he ate ALL of the strawberry ice cream.", "NTA. He is so selfish. He isn't even replacing what he eats. Well, he does get his way now. The food isn't technically in the house so he can go and get his own. You are growing a whole human in your body and your husband is being a baby about food.", "NTA the fact he is taking your snacks and food and not replacing them is the biggest issue here. He knows very well what he is doing and he doesn't care. this could be the beginning of other behaviors, so please pay attention.", "NTA and bravo to you.", "NTA. your husband is being really inconsiderate of your needs while you're pregnant with (i'm assuming) his child. at the very least he could replace what he's eaten so you don't have to make trips back and forth to the store. also, if your bank accounts are separate, then you don't need to inform him of making \"large purchases\" that only concern yourself. this fridge is for you specifically and not for him, therefore he shouldn't get a say in it.", "NTA\n\nWhat an entitled AH you have for a partner. This is a red flag and it\u2019s probably not the only one he\u2019s been waving around.", "NTA, the problem is not him eating your food it is his lack of respect for your time, effort, and money.
