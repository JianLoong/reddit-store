Before we moved into our rental house, we stayed with his parents and saved. I was working for them at the time and staying with my sister over an hour away so they suggested staying with them until we moved out. \n\nNow my bf has a younger sister (22f) who we will call Cindy. My bf and I were having a hard time finding places so his parents suggested we have Cindy move in (two birds one stone, they seemed to really want everyone out). An important side note: we at first were not going to have someone else, we had qualified for a place on our own but it was very small and run down and just not great, but my bf\u2019s mom assured us they would not let us fail and would help if needed. My bf\u2019s Mom also suggested another roommate, as she knew someone at church who was looking for a place for their son. So with four people splitting rent we got a slightly bigger house. The lease is signed by my bf and Cindy, i\u2019m not on it because i\u2019m working on my credit and didn\u2019t want to risk paying more or just not getting the place. So we get the place and everything is good and it\u2019s not a ton of money for everyone. \n\nNow at the end of may there were issues, basically Cindy had a boyfriend (20m) who was just out of rehab and in AA and needed to stay with them. She did not ask any of us, she texted our roommate group chat and announced he was moving in a few weeks from now, but doesn\u2019t give us a set date. We were annoyed, but decided that less rent was ideal and we could deal with it so we said okay. Then, 3 days before rent is due for June, Cindy moves him in without telling anyone it\u2019s happening. We are annoyed but just move on. Later that night, we text the group chat again and say rent is due in three days and just make sure everyone has the right amount. Cindy responds that her boyfriend won\u2019t be paying until july as he is looking for a job, we then respond that he can\u2019t stay here for free. she doesn\u2019t respond for a bit so i start falling asleep in bed, and my boyfriend is watching a show. Cindy then comes busting in through the door screaming at us saying her boyfriend can\u2019t afford rent yet because he doesn\u2019t have a job. There\u2019s then this long fight with her and my boyfriend and she is just yelling at us. \n\nThe next day, their parents come and move her out without a word. We are then stuck covering her part for june rent, which was rough. Her parents have moved her and her boyfriend in and we are just stuck paying for her. Now, it\u2019s been a few months and now are still paying so much because of her and it\u2019s killing us financially. Their parents keep inviting me to things and while my boyfriend sometimes goes I usually stay home because of how angry I am. So, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s a terrible idea to just tell them all how I actually feel and why I don\u2019t want to be around them.", "created_utc": 1698939722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17m6cz2/wibta_if_i_told_my_boyfriends_family_the_full/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One question though, aren't they aware already that that's the reason you're not visiting? Doesn't seem that hard to figure out tbh", "IMO your bf needs to talk to mom and dad about the situation of Cindy moving out and you guys being stuck paying more rent. It's his name on the lease along with Cindy's and if you guys get behind in the rent it can affect your bf and Cindy's credit scores. Bf's parents may be clueless about the situation because bf might be making up some excuses for you not coming round instead of discussing what actually happened. Anyway, YWNBTA", "NTA for being upset but they\u2019ve already taken the daughter\u2019s side so I think you are just going to find yourself with more unresolved anger. I think you need to let this one go. They are not going to side with you over their daughter. Perhaps you can reapply for the smaller more affordable apartment.", "NTA\n\nTell them, they need to know exactly what they and their daughter did to you.  Just tell them as kindly as possible, \"Hey, the reason I'm not hanging out is I am feeling a certain way about how you move daughter out so fast, and we were stuck paying her share of the rent.  It put us in a terrible situation financially. \n\n It will get it off your chest and you will feel better.  Good luck finding a roommate!!", "If Cindy signed the lease, she can't just move out and not pay. I would ask that your bf address this with them but I think you're right to stay away from them. NTA", "NTA but no need tot tell them, they know. They know the position you were in before and that it was their idea to move in together. If they ask you directly just tell them you can't afford to go and leave it at that.", "You wouldn't be a jerk if you told them why you weren't hanging out.  \"I would like to, but Cindy's abrupt move out makes me and BF responsible for a lot more rent now, and money is tight.\"  But like others have said, I don't know how much good it would do you.  If anybody needs to have that discussion, it's your boyfriend.  I've read enough stories here to know that if you broach the subject, you WILL be the bad guy, whether you're right or not.  \n\nHowever, I really think that the parents did you a solid here.  This sister and her boyfriend sound like bad news.  I think you would have had a lot of other, more serious problems if you had to live with them long term.", "Communicate your views, just be kind in your method of communication.", "NTA. Just get another roommate.", "NTA\n\nI reckon they already know. You're NTA but I think telling them won't result in anything because they'll side with the daughter. I'd just have nothing to do with them or her again. I would maybe stop sending excuses and let your bf explain to them, if he wants to. I wouldn't waste my time at all.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't pay for cindy. She is up to pay half of the rent - tell his parents she will have to pay or you will need to sue her for the rent, because you can not afford her half, too.", "NTA, but it is just going to blow up and go nowhere.  If you intend to remain part of the family, it is probably not worth bringing up since nothing will change.  Just don't go to family events.  If your bf gets up the nerve and they ask where you are, he can tell them that what they did makes neither of you want to see them, but I am pretty sure his parents still have his guts at home.  I would have said a hard no when she mentioned moving him in, but you weren't even on the lease, and neither of you said no or even brought up splitting rent and bills, etc.  Of course she thought she could do whatever she wanted as no one said no.  Her parents did not live up to their end of the bargain, but that is up to your bf to bring up to them.  The fact that he did not say no to his sister shows you he probably knew what would happen, his parents would pull their offer for help.  You and your bf have the biggest issue, lack of  communication with each other and everyone else.", "So get another room-mate.\n\nESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you're too angry still to address this with them in a way that you won't lose your sh\\*t doing it, then maybe bf can assist. \n\nBTW, any chance you find a roommate or two to help cover rent?", "Not really, they seem to think that it\u2019s not as big of a deal and i usually have an excuse to not go over there. They very much do not want issues so much that they will not acknowledge it at all. They are also not great at accepting when they messed up.  I think they also think that I don\u2019t visit because of the sister being there but it\u2019s really all of them. So i\u2019m just trying to decide if I should let this one go or make it known how I feel about our treatment.", "He has been pretty up front about everything, but they have long labeled him the \u201cproblem child\u201d (he smoked and didn\u2019t go to college) so they don\u2019t really take him seriously when he\u2019s angry. I do think he needs to but i also think it\u2019s hard for him because he doesn\u2019t want to just get shot down by the family again. but you\u2019re probably right and I should just make us all sit down and talk about it", "The apartment is a problem just because we have two very big dogs that are not on most apartments approved dogs list, and I would feel terrible for taking away their yard. We can afford to live in a house just not this one because it was meant to be spilt four ways. We also didn\u2019t change our roommates rent because it wasn\u2019t really his fault so we\u2019re just covering her portion outright. But you\u2019re right, i\u2019m not their daughter and they will not side with me so i\u2019m just frustrated with all of this because if I say something it puts my relationship in harms way and I don\u2019t want my Bf to not like his family just because I do.", "I considered the legal side of things, but as we have dogs that are not on the lease and people who are not on the lease I didn\u2019t want to risk it. Their parents are also lawyers and own a big law firm here in town so i doubt that would be a good path.", "Thank you, I\u2019m thinking I will just let it be for now and keep my distance, I don\u2019t see anything good coming out of me speaking my mind on this, and hopefully karma will get her here soon. She seemingly has never dealt with a consequence in her life and i would love to see that catch up to her.", "we\u2019re trying to find someone but as we live in a smallish town way outside the city it\u2019s hard to find someone.", "We\u2019ve been trying, we live in a small town farther from the city and we cannot find anyone", "You said it's been a few months, right? If you're still angry about it now (not blaming you for that), it seems to me that it would be hard to let it go and that it might be better to talk it out", "If Cindy is on the lease, then she needs to continue paying her share of the rent.", "Ah, I see", "It\u2019s been several months, the issue is more information keeps coming up. Like her going to work (we all work together) and telling everyone there including upper management that my boyfriend hit her and physically kicked her out (didn\u2019t happen i was there the entire time, she came into our room screaming and we just tried to get her out) and her boyfriend still living with the parents and still not having a job, and now the parents are about to buy her a new car (she broke her Q5 that they also gave her) and pay for her to go back to college", "Oh wow, that makes it even worse. Do they know about her slandering your boyfriend?", "Apparently that is what she told them the day they came to move her out, and that\u2019s why they were being so cold and just mean about it. We couldn\u2019t figure it out until someone with worked with let us know what was up (I had taken some time off work around this then as it was my second job so i wasn\u2019t around all the time or I would\u2019ve known sooner) and my boyfriend works in a different section of the place so he didn\u2019t know for a while", "Damn, that's messed up. From what you said to another commenter, it sounds a bit like she's the golden child. I still think that you absolutely WNBTAH for telling them the truth, but I'm starting to doubt that they'd really care or see your point. So my advice would be, talk to them if you feel you want to get iflt off your chest, otherwise keep things the way they are now"]}
