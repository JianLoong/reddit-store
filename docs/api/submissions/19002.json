You may have felt it was a \"more friendly way,\" but it may just be a matter of feeling hurt now that she has surpassed you in her physical prowess and not that she is actually trying to be mean. Talk to her about how you have felt about the way she is teasing you about losing matches and listen to what she says about the difference in tone may or may not be. You might think it is mean spirited when it is just feeling the loss.\n\n\nAlso, INFO,\nDid you two challenge each other and sometimes fight even when she may have not consented in the past? Have you ever been in a similar situation except it was \"different \" because you picking up your gf or play fighting and her losing is \"cute\" or \"just flirting?\" Make sure your issues with consent aren't an indication of a more serious problem between you.

He put an edit stating before they would only play fight when they had permission of both of them. Suddenly, one is stronger than the other, and the second yes isn't needed?

She knew exactly what she was doing.\n\nNTA\n\nIt's not that she must apologize, but she must acknowledge that this is an unusual situation brought about by a medical condition.

How is what she did okay?", "She has already invalidated your feelings and done things you did not consent to with the likely intention of humiliating you.

OP pokes her over and over again \u201cgloating\u201d about his superior strength (as they\u2019ve admitted). GF consented to the wresting despite always losing, because OP enjoyed it. Sounds like not so much for GF. Now GF isn\u2019t so easily dominant and not subject to being teased for being physically weaker. \n\nIt\u2019s like a story of bully getting bullied by the person they bullied and them declaring the new bully took it to far. It\u2019s hard to feel sympathetic for somebody who set the president for generally poor behavior.\n\nThe right answer is for OP acknowledge he set a standard for poor behavior and GF escalated it. They should both apologize and just stop this whole wrestling silliness.", "My question is: did she actually consent? Or did OP assume she did because instead of complaining she smiled and laughed and hid the embarrassment because, as you mentioned, women are conditioned to do so. To do whatever is necessary to make their partner feel masculine and strong even at their own expense. Her \u201ctables have turned\u201d may have been about more than being beaten in a wrestling match. It doesn\u2019t make her any less of an A H for continuing on when she knows he dislikes it, but her comments read more bitter than the \u201cinnocent\u201d wrestling of the past warrants.\n\nEdit: typo", "No it is a issue of consent. Body autonomy isn't something you get to just over-ride just because the situation doesn't seem fair based on past events.

Therefore you agree to sex on all Fridays.\" Consent is something that can be rescinded, denied at any time. That goes for all forms of body autonomy not just sex. The two of them are still wrestling at home. He just didn't want to do it at that particular point in time. \n\nHe may not wanted to in public because it may be something that highlights his recent PHYSICAL  DISABILITY!! something very personal to a lot of people. Something he may still be comming to terms with. Not inherintly because rules for me and not for thee.  Please learn to respect people's bodies and their rights to do with them as they please at all times.", "Or maybe he didn\u2019t want to do it bc they were at a party and it\u2019s kind of weird to start wrestling your gf in the middle of a party. Also, it seems like she wanted to do it to embarrass him, that\u2019s why she chose that time and place to do that. I\u2019m not unsympathetic to her tho, I\u2019m sure it feels great for her to be strong and feel confident and he should support that, but not at his expense, publicly, when he didn\u2019t consent to doing it", "Doesn\u2019t change that they\u2019re both assholes for their part lol. To be so nit picky about the verbiage of ESH and YTA when I gave specific reasons for both is stupid and lacks critical thinking skills.

We're not all cookie cut-outs who conform to the same bullshit definition YOU want to limit us to. We don't all fall into the narrow itty bitty 'woe is me' box you wanna shove us into.\n\nConsent is consent. No means no. To justify it because everyone wants to assume their dynamic, point and laugh about OP getting a taste of his own medicine is a slap in the face to every woman out there.

I ASSUME that neither one had previously objected.\n\nNow, of op used to force his gf into wrestling in public against her will (ie if she had objected), and now she has turned the tables, is day she is a justified AH.

I had a ex GF that was partially responsible for brakeing a very expensive lamp in my room several years ago I imported because her and a mutual friend (male)  decided to try to see who was the better fighter.

Other women do power lifting and can be every bit of a gym rat as your average dude bro. \n\nOPs GF is pressing over 300lb lb according to his post. That's not \"I'm going to bulk up because my partner is a dick.\" That's \"I'm lifting reguarly because I love it and like my body this way.\" Good for her. People that into fitness and having that much strength often also enjoy showing it off. It's entirely possible she has a competitive streak and takes it too far.", "This. Also, he\u2019s now, for medical reasons, in the tiny minority of men who are physically weaker than their female partners.

Line, I get that Christ on the cross getting \"nailed\" by Metheny is a bad choice for a tattoo, but it doesn't belong on that sub if that shitty tattoo choice was executed perfectly.", "The concern is that your girlfriend is willing to restrain you and humiliate you just because she physically can, and is unwilling to apologize or back down when you're unhappy about it.  If that's the case, where's the line?  \n\nI don't know if it's *that* bad--it's possible your girlfriend is getting used to a new physical dynamic, and is just being a bit of a sore winner about it, and doesn't understand the problem.  There's a good chance that if y'all can sit and chat about it, she'll turn around.
