OP should take this situation as a chance to reflect on how being outmatched because of something beyond your control sucks, and it's made even worse when someone gloats about it. And because women so often are outmatched physically, we are conditioned to just smile and laugh and accept it. \n\nFrom 'Overboard'(1987) \" You... most of us go through life with blinders on, ... Knowing only that one little station to which we were born. But now you, ... on the other hand, had the... rare privilege of escaping your bonds for just a spell. To see life from an entirely new perspective. How you choose to use that information, ... is entirely up to you.\" (It tracks, no?)", "Great point! Consent is important; the human body is inviolable for anyone, any reason!\n\nOp also tells us he has a health issue where he cannot put on muscle. Guess what happens when you cannot put on muscle? The little muscle you have atrophies, causing widespread pain, and your joints become unstable with nothing to support then, so you are very likely to sprain/tear/spasm/dislocate something even with normal movement.\n\nI obviously don\u2019t know what OP has, but I have a condition that also prevents muscle growth called Ehlers Danlos syndrome\u2014it is progressive, and while not life threatening now, it may become so in the future.

On a bad day, my spouse knows better than to even touch me\u2014much less play fight. And he would never do any of this without my consent, especially in front if an audience. \n\nThis story reads as essentially an athlete fighting a potentially disabled person without his consent with the intent to humiliate / emasculate him in front of an audience. NTA, OP, and your GFs behavior speaks volumes about her own confidence levels. Be aware that this is a red flag for a potentially toxic personality trait. \n\nOn the other hand OP, your history here is a little different, as you\u2019ve engaged in horseplay regularly in front of others. So I\u2019m willing to give GF the benefit of the doubt. But, if your condition is anything like mine, you might need to explain to GF that each day is different for you and she needs to check in first.
