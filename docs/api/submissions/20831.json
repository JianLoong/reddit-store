Said home gym had a treadmill and a couple sets of fixed weight dumbbells.\n\nI couldn\u2019t use this to work out, for a couple reasons: 1) there\u2019s a lot of workouts in my routine that I need machines for, such as lat pull-downs and face pulls 2) there are also workouts I use barbells for instead of dumbbells 3) the dumbbells are lighter than I lift, so lifting them isn\u2019t much of a workout 4) I prefer running in nature instead of on a treadmill.\n\nSo, I thanked her for the present and said it was sweet but explained I can\u2019t really use it and said that I would continue going to the gym and out for runs like usual. She got angry and said she spent a lot of money on this and that I shouldn\u2019t be so ungrateful.\n\nAITA int his scenario?

Spending time together in the same space but not interacting, or only interacting on a roommate level (what's for dinner, whose doing the laundry today, etc) probably doesn't count as quality for her. While she went about this the wrong way, there's clearly something she's missing in this relationship. Could you be doing better for her, or have you given all you have to give and it's a compatibility issue?", "NTA - Very obvious that wasn\u2019t a gift for you and more of a gift for herself so you wouldn\u2019t go to the gym.", "NTA.  She seems to want a hostage rather than a boyfriend.", "NTA for not using the home gym, but you have class all day, spend about 2 to 3 hours outside of the house, how many hours of time does it leave you to spend quality time with her? Taking into account the cooking, chores and sleeping don't count lol.

She's sending you a cue that she wants more quality time with you, even if she didn't go about it in the best of ways.", "NTA - definitely self serving and her own fault for dropping all that money without checking with you first that you even wanted a home gym. If she wants to spend more time with you she can come to the gym", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t take into consideration what you wanted or needed when she built the home gym.

She may have been trying to do something nice, but then she would have made a gym that matched your needs. You can create routine for the home gym for 1-2 times a week, but continue attending the gym for 5-6 days - that is a compromise, but I assume not one she would like. \n\nWhile that is a lot of time at the gym, many use the gym for mental health as much a physical and it is a routine and helps reduce stress. \n\nThis is greater conversation about quality time, and what you both want and need out of the relationship. Your ratios of independence and togetherness may not be matching, she wants you around more and you like being autonomous for periods every day.", "NTA, I'm leaning towards the fact that your girlfriend has separation issues. This could become a problem to the point where she doesn't want to be left alone at any time", "NTA. An hour at the gym with an additional hour run a few times a week is completely reasonable. There are so many benefits to working out other than weight control, including improved mental health and multiple physical benefits. \n\nPlus if your your working from home just getting out of the house and around other people. \n\nThe home gym was about your girlfriend trying to control your time, not really about a gift for you.", "NTA. I understand her feeling disappointed that her gift didn't pan out, but it also kind of sounds like this was an attempt to manipulate you out of your regular gym/workout routine. You guys are young and don't have kids or full-time jobs (it sounds like?), and you live together - it's perfectly fine for you to go to the gym by yourself for an hour every day if it makes you happy, she shouldn't resent that.", "NTA I couldn\u2019t fathom being with someone so clingy and overbearing", "NTA. But you and your girlfriend need to sit down and have a conversation about personal time and couple time.

The people commenting that \u201cshe just wants quality time\u201d would change their tune fast if the genders were reversed. This is controlling behavior disguised as a gift. If a man did this to his female partner everyone would be talking about red flags.", "NTA because the gym time is for you. She never asked your input about a home gym.

This was a sweet idea with poor execution, which proved the importance of communication. If she had communicated her intent you could have shared what would actually have been helpful. \n\nThe nice thing is that the treadmill can be a great option for days it rains outside, or it can be used as a quick warm up before you run. So not a total loss. \n\nYou might also find you want to incorporate other types of exercise occasionally to work different muscles. Perhaps you\u2019d like kettlebells. If so, you can purchase some and use those at the home gym. \n\nThis sounds like something someone who never exercises would do as a nice gesture, without realizing they don\u2019t know enough about your needs to get you what you need. Hopefully you two can use this as a way to improve your communication. If she continues to be angry without realizing the role she played in getting a gift without understanding your needs, perhaps she isn\u2019t mature enough to be in a relationship with you. \n\nGood luck!", "Red flag. She is trying to change who you are. NTA", "NTA... you didnt indicate you wanted this. It was foolish to spend the time and money on it. \n\nYou cant control someone's work out. \n\nYou are spending about 8 hours away doing your exercise. Is she being neglected? Are you doing your half of the cooking and cleaning? Are you willing to listen to her concerns.\n\nIn the end it's up to her to decide if she wants to stay with you.", "NTA sure she was trying to do something nice and because she wants more time with you, but for an avid gym goer who likes to lift heavy that is super inefficient. Also running outside is better for your joints your knees will thank you when you're older. Plus treadmill scenery is boring and the noise for an hour straight would probably annoy her. I'd give her a list of equipment required to make a home gym effective.... Olympic bar, assorted plates, squat rack, bench, and a dual cable machine with assorted attachments. Thank her for the gesture but explain that the stuff you would need is way more expensive and not feesable. Maybe one night a week you can do arms at home and she can chill on the treadmill and hang out? Also I wish more people knew how empowering and amazing lifting is. Its not just for weight maintenance it helps you age gracefully and reduce aches and pains, not to mention mental health benefits.", "NTA, it\u2019s like getting a new camera for a professional photographer when you know nothing about even normal cameras", "NTA. She\u2019s too needy. Dump her.", "NTA- as someone stated, this was a present for her not for you. I don't really see her concern unless this 2 hours a day is some of the only time you two can spend together. In the interest of keeping the peace you could attempt to expand the home gym and create something that you could use for at least a couple days. I know my push days are could predominantly be done at home. If space is an issue I'd return the treadmill and see about getting a cable instead. (I love my cables)", "NTA.  She is just a bit clingy I bet.  Tell her to take the exercise stuff back and get her money back.", "I got the same vibe overall, that this was a self serving way for her to get something she wanted", "NTA\n\n Totally this. She never asked igf you would be happy with a home gym or what you might need. This is manipulation at its finest. making you feel guilty beause she has spent money on you so you must be thankful and not go to the gym.\n\nIt's healthy for the relationship to have me-time and time with friends only  when you are leaving and spending so many hours together.", "She also thought enough of you to not take your workout needs into account at all in what she bought.   \n\n\nShe is telling you something. Are you listening? This could be a relatively minor conversation. This could also be a giant red flag. Regardless, a conversation needs to be had.", "I wish she had.

You don\u2019t have to be a gym rat to know that people have different routines and use specific equipment to work out. You can\u2019t just buy random weights and assume it\u2019s going to be useful. And exercise is clearly important to him so I imagine he\u2019s talked about his gym routine at some point\u2026she just paid no attention.", "But how much of that is quality time focusing on each other?", "Wfh does not count as time together.", "Maybe encourage her to join you at the gym by emphasizing to her \u201cit would be fun to have her come to the gym with me.\u201d", "NTA. I am so confused by people saying OP is wrong. An hour and half a day to your self is nothing. I have been married for 20 years and we each take time to our selves.

This gift was Not a gift for you OP it was a gift for her and it was very manipulating. I would sit down and have an open and honest discussion. Figure out what her expectations are and see if there is something that can be changed. If her expectations don\u2019t work for you that\u2019s fine too.

If you're going to question wfh as not spending time together then do the same with her bogus idea of a home gym", "You say that as if it's a reasonable expectation. When these two are older and have \"real\" jobs, and maybe children, they'll have even less time to spend together, and \"alone time\" becomes even more important.\n\n\"Actively going on dates\" is not something that's even an option for most adults with lives and families. The occasional date night ends up being a treat, if you even get that.\n\nIn any case, the guy answered \"most of the day\", so I think you're just pushing for no reason when your question has been answered already.", "Yes, I also said that we already spend almost all of every day together.
