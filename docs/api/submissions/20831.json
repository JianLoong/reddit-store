Said home gym had a treadmill and a couple sets of fixed weight dumbbells.\n\nI couldn\u2019t use this to work out, for a couple reasons: 1) there\u2019s a lot of workouts in my routine that I need machines for, such as lat pull-downs and face pulls 2) there are also workouts I use barbells for instead of dumbbells 3) the dumbbells are lighter than I lift, so lifting them isn\u2019t much of a workout 4) I prefer running in nature instead of on a treadmill.\n\nSo, I thanked her for the present and said it was sweet but explained I can\u2019t really use it and said that I would continue going to the gym and out for runs like usual. She got angry and said she spent a lot of money on this and that I shouldn\u2019t be so ungrateful.\n\nAITA int his scenario?

Spending time together in the same space but not interacting, or only interacting on a roommate level (what's for dinner, whose doing the laundry today, etc) probably doesn't count as quality for her. While she went about this the wrong way, there's clearly something she's missing in this relationship. Could you be doing better for her, or have you given all you have to give and it's a compatibility issue?", "NTA - Very obvious that wasn\u2019t a gift for you and more of a gift for herself so you wouldn\u2019t go to the gym.", "NTA.  She seems to want a hostage rather than a boyfriend.", "NTA for not using the home gym, but you have class all day, spend about 2 to 3 hours outside of the house, how many hours of time does it leave you to spend quality time with her? Taking into account the cooking, chores and sleeping don't count lol.

She's sending you a cue that she wants more quality time with you, even if she didn't go about it in the best of ways.", "NTA - definitely self serving and her own fault for dropping all that money without checking with you first that you even wanted a home gym. If she wants to spend more time with you she can come to the gym", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t take into consideration what you wanted or needed when she built the home gym.

She may have been trying to do something nice, but then she would have made a gym that matched your needs. You can create routine for the home gym for 1-2 times a week, but continue attending the gym for 5-6 days - that is a compromise, but I assume not one she would like. \n\nWhile that is a lot of time at the gym, many use the gym for mental health as much a physical and it is a routine and helps reduce stress. \n\nThis is greater conversation about quality time, and what you both want and need out of the relationship. Your ratios of independence and togetherness may not be matching, she wants you around more and you like being autonomous for periods every day.", "NTA, I'm leaning towards the fact that your girlfriend has separation issues. This could become a problem to the point where she doesn't want to be left alone at any time", "NTA. An hour at the gym with an additional hour run a few times a week is completely reasonable. There are so many benefits to working out other than weight control, including improved mental health and multiple physical benefits. \n\nPlus if your your working from home just getting out of the house and around other people. \n\nThe home gym was about your girlfriend trying to control your time, not really about a gift for you.", "NTA. I understand her feeling disappointed that her gift didn't pan out, but it also kind of sounds like this was an attempt to manipulate you out of your regular gym/workout routine. You guys are young and don't have kids or full-time jobs (it sounds like?), and you live together - it's perfectly fine for you to go to the gym by yourself for an hour every day if it makes you happy, she shouldn't resent that.", "NTA I couldn\u2019t fathom being with someone so clingy and overbearing", "NTA. But you and your girlfriend need to sit down and have a conversation about personal time and couple time.

The people commenting that \u201cshe just wants quality time\u201d would change their tune fast if the genders were reversed. This is controlling behavior disguised as a gift. If a man did this to his female partner everyone would be talking about red flags.", "NTA because the gym time is for you. She never asked your input about a home gym.

This was a sweet idea with poor execution, which proved the importance of communication. If she had communicated her intent you could have shared what would actually have been helpful. \n\nThe nice thing is that the treadmill can be a great option for days it rains outside, or it can be used as a quick warm up before you run. So not a total loss. \n\nYou might also find you want to incorporate other types of exercise occasionally to work different muscles. Perhaps you\u2019d like kettlebells. If so, you can purchase some and use those at the home gym. \n\nThis sounds like something someone who never exercises would do as a nice gesture, without realizing they don\u2019t know enough about your needs to get you what you need. Hopefully you two can use this as a way to improve your communication. If she continues to be angry without realizing the role she played in getting a gift without understanding your needs, perhaps she isn\u2019t mature enough to be in a relationship with you. \n\nGood luck!", "Red flag. She is trying to change who you are. NTA", "NTA... you didnt indicate you wanted this. It was foolish to spend the time and money on it. \n\nYou cant control someone's work out. \n\nYou are spending about 8 hours away doing your exercise. Is she being neglected? Are you doing your half of the cooking and cleaning? Are you willing to listen to her concerns.\n\nIn the end it's up to her to decide if she wants to stay with you.", "NTA sure she was trying to do something nice and because she wants more time with you, but for an avid gym goer who likes to lift heavy that is super inefficient. Also running outside is better for your joints your knees will thank you when you're older. Plus treadmill scenery is boring and the noise for an hour straight would probably annoy her. I'd give her a list of equipment required to make a home gym effective.... Olympic bar, assorted plates, squat rack, bench, and a dual cable machine with assorted attachments. Thank her for the gesture but explain that the stuff you would need is way more expensive and not feesable. Maybe one night a week you can do arms at home and she can chill on the treadmill and hang out? Also I wish more people knew how empowering and amazing lifting is. Its not just for weight maintenance it helps you age gracefully and reduce aches and pains, not to mention mental health benefits.", "NTA, it\u2019s like getting a new camera for a professional photographer when you know nothing about even normal cameras", "NTA. She\u2019s too needy. Dump her.", "NTA- as someone stated, this was a present for her not for you. I don't really see her concern unless this 2 hours a day is some of the only time you two can spend together. In the interest of keeping the peace you could attempt to expand the home gym and create something that you could use for at least a couple days. I know my push days are could predominantly be done at home. If space is an issue I'd return the treadmill and see about getting a cable instead. (I love my cables)", "NTA.  She is just a bit clingy I bet.  Tell her to take the exercise stuff back and get her money back.", "I got the same vibe overall, that this was a self serving way for her to get something she wanted", "NTA\n\n Totally this. She never asked igf you would be happy with a home gym or what you might need. This is manipulation at its finest. making you feel guilty beause she has spent money on you so you must be thankful and not go to the gym.\n\nIt's healthy for the relationship to have me-time and time with friends only  when you are leaving and spending so many hours together.", "She also thought enough of you to not take your workout needs into account at all in what she bought.   \n\n\nShe is telling you something. Are you listening? This could be a relatively minor conversation. This could also be a giant red flag. Regardless, a conversation needs to be had.", "I wish she had.

You don\u2019t have to be a gym rat to know that people have different routines and use specific equipment to work out. You can\u2019t just buy random weights and assume it\u2019s going to be useful. And exercise is clearly important to him so I imagine he\u2019s talked about his gym routine at some point\u2026she just paid no attention.", "But how much of that is quality time focusing on each other?", "Wfh does not count as time together.", "Maybe encourage her to join you at the gym by emphasizing to her \u201cit would be fun to have her come to the gym with me.\u201d", "NTA. I am so confused by people saying OP is wrong. An hour and half a day to your self is nothing. I have been married for 20 years and we each take time to our selves.

This gift was Not a gift for you OP it was a gift for her and it was very manipulating. I would sit down and have an open and honest discussion. Figure out what her expectations are and see if there is something that can be changed. If her expectations don\u2019t work for you that\u2019s fine too.

We\u2019ll do plank and wall sit challenges\u2026 it can be a very social experience for some.", "Also for a lot of people errands, cooking, or other household activities can be quality time. If my husband and I clean the garage that is still quality time if you are in a relationship with someone you like.", "He suggested she go to the gym with him, that seems like it would solve her issues of not spending enough time together.  She just doesn't want to.", "They gotta be in college and working part time at most; corporate FT jobs + working out 1-1.5 hr 4-5x a week really means only 2-3 hours a day w their SO, and that is if they live together.", "can you use it like one or two days a week? or would she still be pisssed off?", "NTA. She SHOULD have checked with you first to see what you'd need. And going to the gym isn't just to lose weight.  She CAN to go tone up but maybe feels self conscious or ignorant of her needs/desires.  \"Naturally skinny\" doesn't mean anything. She can build muscle.  \n\nAsk her if she'd like you to \"draw up a plan\" for her. I feel bad for her using the money not really knowing your routine. She COULD be distrustful to some degree and wants you home.  Reassure her your eyes only want her if that's a possibility.  \n\nBut LISTEN to her.  She wants to spend more time with you. Don't ignore that. Find a compromise you can work with.  Missing a day at the gym and making \"date night\" for her might help.  Give HER a day to look forward to. Or someone else might.  \n\nAll relationships take some compromise.  Find what you can give her that she really wants.", "NTA your gf sounds exhausting", "INFO : why are you with someone so clingy?", "No, NTA. While it's thoughtful of your girlfriend to create a home gym for you as a birthday present, it's understandable that you have valid reasons for not being able to use it effectively. \n\nYou have specific workout routines that require machines and barbells, and the equipment she provided doesn't meet your needs. It's important to communicate your gratitude for her efforts, but also explain why it doesn't work for you. \n\nFinding a compromise or alternative solution that allows you to spend time together without compromising your fitness routine might be helpful.", "NTA.\n\nIf she wanted to get you a home gym, she should have asked you for input. How much she spent is irrelevant - if what she bought is useless to you, it's useless.", "Info : why are you in this relationship ?", "How are you gonna do lat pull downs with dumbbells genius?", "What a dumb comment. It is wayyy easier to train at an actual gym than doing home workouts. If that\u2019s his preference why should he change the way he does things just because his gf made a stupid decision to buy a bunch of stuff he wouldn\u2019t want to use.\n\nThis whole thing could have been avoided if the gf literally just asked \u201chey you could actually be home more if you worked out from home, should we consider buying stuff for a home gym?\u201d To which OP would have said no\n\nAlso not even sure why the dumb as shit gf thought him gyming at home was better than him gyming elsewhere. I don\u2019t know anyone who sees gyming as an opportunity to spend time with someone else, it\u2019s not a social activity", "im confused  in what world 2 hours hours everyday is resonable when you re in a relation with someone . You should let her go and find a gym buddy \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "Is she expecting you to be hanging out and chatting with her during your workout? Like I can kind of understand if she wanted to run with you or something (but even then that can be annoying if you\u2019re not at the same level) but this is just \u2026 weird.", "Bullshit i have a set of dumbbells and they do everything the weight machines can do. OP is TA. Also, what\u2019s more important your relationship or the fucking gym? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "How? Unless you have a job where every moment you have to be hyper fixated on your work/in meetings, they can easily spend time together while working.", "Explain to me how gyming at home would be a better solution than gyming outside? it\u2019s not like OP would be chatting with his gf while he gyms\u2026 what a stupid solution", "Only if you\u2019re both doing the same routine, and I think that\u2019s likely rare. My husband and I have very different workout goals, our gym time is our own time. The only time we do what you\u2019re doing is usually HIIT at a hotel gym when you\u2019re on vacation, but otherwise no.", "That\u2019s absolutely adorable (I truly mean that) but his gf doesn\u2019t want to work out with him, she just doesn\u2019t want him going to the gym.", "I mean ok you do you but work from home to me means I'm working. Not paying attention to my partner. \n\nLunch is a possibility that did not initially cross my mind however.", "Sure, I get the gym is more important than people to you. Stfu", "Not only that. She said she didn't have to go to the gym bc she was already skinny. Which shows she doesn't really understand why you work out. She sounds shallow.", "Explain it then wise guy, how would OP gyming at home improve their relationship?", "She might just be naive and not understand how metabolism slows down because I guarantee you like at least 75% of people workout to get skinnier and better looking", "Maybe more context is needed, but from your post it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s trying to control you. She\u2019s trying to find a compromise so the two of you can spend more time together, and it\u2019s equally as likely she was doing it with incredibly thoughtful intentions as it is that she was doing it to be manipulative. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re assuming the negative about her, shows that you don\u2019t really think that highly of her. Why that is, the reason doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is you\u2019ve reached a point where you\u2019re not willing to find a compromise with her and you automatically assume the worst in her. Both are signs that this relationship has run its course.", "What do you mean \u201cbingo\u201d? \n\nWtf\u2026\n\nAre you ok?", "NTA, it's a good thought, but lets be clear her gift wasn't for you, it was so you would be at home more.\n\nIt was foolish of her to setup a home gym without consulting you.", "She didn\u2019t even ask you what kind of equipment you would need?! She didn\u2019t really care. As others stated it was about her and her feelings. I\u2019d be looking at other aspects of the relationship. Just based on this she seems kind of self centered.", "\nI had GFs like this who wanted to controll all of my time. This is not about love, it's about control. Also it will probably not ever get better. If not gym, would be something else. You see how she tries to make you the bad guy here, for not using gift that is in practice useless to you.\n\nThink about her behavior, are there other red flags in her behavior towards you. If yes, is this a long term partner that you want in your life?\n\nAlso I would dare to guess that she has much less interests/hobbies in life than you, meaning you are focus of her attention at all times.", "ESH. OP, have you tried to spend more time with her? She\u2019s spending major $$ because her needs aren\u2019t being met. Have you tried actually setting time aside for her?", "You said the same thing twice, just with point 1 you took more words to arrive at the conclusion .", "OP has been dodging the question about quality time on all posts which ultimately leads me to believe he doesn't know what it is, or know damn well he's not minding her when he's at home.", "Again, spending time together doesn't mean you're actually connecting but okay, I give up on explaining that.\n\nThe gf being jealous is also a valid idea. Good one.", "I'm okay, thanks for asking! Are you okay?", "NTA for not wanting the 'gift'. But it sounds like your gf is feeling seriously neglected, and you may be a bit AHish for that.\n\nTime for a heart-to-heart.", "NTA....not your fault, she didn't ask you what you needed, or investigate what you do need. If she had any actual interest in what you did, she'd of tagged along or ask questions to get an idea of what you actually needed.There are women who for some ungodly reason, cant stand you being out of their sight, and try all sorts of things to keep you in the door. Just keep doing what your doing, and i'm sure if she got you a full home gym, give her 6 months and she'd be complaining that all you do is spend all your time in the spare room, working out.  Been there, lived it. Just keep doing what your doing,", "NTA I\\`m guessing this was a suprise, so she can not be mad if you\\`re not thrilled about it.", "u can work out for purposes other than losing weight,he didn't tell her to \"get skinnier\" he asked her to join him.", "Well, see how a Tribble reacts and go from there..."]}
