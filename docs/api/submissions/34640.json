YTA - lets get that out of the way\n2. 3rd sentence in you've insulted your GF, calling her vain.... sorry *very* vain.   You hadn't even got to the story yet.  Question for you:  Do you even like your girlfriend?  If no, then move on. \n3. 4-5 inch heels.  Did you measure? Are you sure?  Are you a shoe afficionado and can eyeball such things? Or were they just \"high heels\" and you are exaggerating?\n4. At what point in your journey when you noped out of all the sightseeing before her did you tell her \"I'm sorry honey.  You were right and I was wrong\"?   What... you didn't??  Well thats very surprising. \n5. So.  Calling her dumb, sorry,  *incredibly* dumb.  Given that that moment was the moment that sucked all the joy out of the trip.  Not her shoe choice, mind you. You insulting her.   Was it worth it?  Literally ruining a trip to NYC.  So there was no enjoyment of any sites, no lively banter, romantic moments, having wonderful meals.  None of that, all of that was ruined by one little comment.    So was it worth it?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook man, here's the thing, it is perfectly ok to be concerned for your GF's health.  \n\n\"Boy, I hope her feet aren't going to hurt\". you  think to yourself and then say out loud \n\n \"Hey honey, we're going to be doing a lot of walking.  Did you want to bring sneakers?\"   \n\nThen perhaps she'll say \n\n\"nah, I'm just bringing these,  I'll be ok\".  \n\nThen you will think to yourself \"well,  She's an adult and certainly can make her own choices.  So what else will I bring\".  \n\nBut you went to \"dumb stupid dummy\".   And I will grant you, her dogs were probably screaming at the end of the day,  but she's probably thinking \"fuck him that asshole.  I'm going to walk till my feet fall off\".   \n\nYou seem like a less than great boyfriend.   One wonders how long this relationship will last.", "YTA. The fact you even had to ask, is pretty alarming. No partner who actually loves their significant other, would talk to them the way you spoke to your girlfriend. I genuinely hope you either work on yourself to become a better person, or she finds someone else who is actually ready to love her like a partner and not call her dumb for something as silly as shoes. She\u2019s a grown ass adult, she can wear whatever she wants. It\u2019s worrying that you feel the need to dictate what she wears. \n\nBut then again, your username kind of says it all really.

But no, you\u2019re just pissed she didn\u2019t obey you like a good girlfriend should. She proved you wrong without even trying, the fact that she did all of those things in high heels is actually impressive as fuck \n\nThe fact that you call her dumb and vain is a reason in itself for you to be the AH. I saw that you chose that username so you would \u201cremember it\u201d, when you easily could have chosen something to do with shoes or this sub without insulting her yet again. I hope she dumps your ass and throws out all your shoes.", "YTA even with sneakers my feet hurt so badly in NYC because I didn't bring the right shoes and wanted to be fashionable instead of comfort. My husband wasn't annoyed. Made one remark saying I should've packed better in a loving tone and I agreed, and then we went out and bought me a knee brace to help for rest of the trip. I couldn't walk as much as we planned and had to rearrange plans and my husband was completely okay with it.", "YTA and I hope she wakes up and drops your ass for someone who actually values her and doesn\u2019t try to play mind games with her. \n\nIf she wears heels all the time, chances are she\u2019s very used to them.

Ask yourself this: why are you dating?  You clearly don't respect some things about her.  You outright call her vain, she suggests you're insecure......there is an unhealthy dynamic scent to this whole thing.

I haven\u2019t responded to anyone else\u2019s comments or changed my opinion in anyway.\n\nOp isn\u2019t TA for calling not bringing sneakers dumb. He was right.", "omg thanks for the tip!!!", "Seriously. Ah yes. Grass. \ud83d\ude06", "I was in my 20s in the 90s. I could walk forever in a chunky heel. It\u2019s not unthinkable that she was fine.", "The UK definitely has incredible art museums, but as a long time Met fan these numbers seemed off to me so I googled and it looks like the Met is the fourth largest art museum, according to Wikipedia. (The Met itself claims 2 million square feet, I have no idea how they are getting that number. That would be twice as big as the Louvre.) \n\nBut OP is an AH in any museum.", "30,000 sq ft? Mid-size?\n\nJust the Greek and Roman gallery alone is 60,000 sq ft.\n\nMaybe you went when part of the museum was closed off.", "Same, and they never die lol", "Worked for me because I have flat feet\u2026.", "I wish you and your self-proclaimed hot daughters all the best!! Hope you\u2019ve got yourself some hot grandkids, too!", "So in your perspective calling your significant other vain, dumb and materialistic is an ok way to describe a partner who doesn\u2019t agree with you? \n\nI think you\u2019re missing the major point that OP was in no way impacted by her decision. If she wants to wear them and doesn\u2019t complain good for her. So why is he so salty that she was able to do it and went ahead with wearing them? Again, non-issue that he\u2019s turned in a major issue with his insults.\n\nEdit: Again, hilarious comparison. If they\u2019re not complaining, who cares! Their choice, their life.", "Dude OP is the one who couldnt last on this trip not the gf you keep doubling down cause you know you are wrong but hate to admit it.", "Idk why but I can\u2019t stop giggling at this \ud83d\ude02", "But heels? Very, very different", "Thank you.", "It\u2019s what you call it when someone takes excessive pride in their looks to the point that they wouldn\u2019t be caught dead without makeup and wear high heels to the airport. It\u2019s not a problem to be vain. \n\nShe\u2019s not TA for wearing heels. She\u2019s the asshole for gloating about it afterward because she wants to say I told you so. Op asked if he\u2019s TA for calling her decision dumb.\n\nShe made a dumb decision to wear heels and got lucky, but that doesn\u2019t make her right.", "I mean, there's nothing to be wrong about. It's an objectively dumb decision to wear heels for prolonged walking and any medical professional would agree. \n\nSurviving a dumb mistake doesn't make it less dumb.", "That makes my night ! Glad I made you chuckle.", "I\u2019m talking about heels. Do you mean stilettos? Or a standard heels? I know people who can wear those for hours, too. Might regret it when they\u2019re 50. But for the moment they can do it.", "You\u2019re just saying heels as if you think we\u2019re not talking about heels. I can stand and dance and walk in d\u2019orsay pumps for 7-8 hours, but will hurt if I\u2019m doing consistent walking. My heeled clogs are fine for a whole day of walking. I can walk in heeled boots for hours and days for long distances. There are many, many different kinds of heels.", "No, they're not. A heel is a heel. You're thinking of stilettos.", "It\u2019s her choice, she\u2019s automatically right. She knows her body and what she\u2019s capable of more than a random internet stranger. So what if she takes pride in her appearance, that not a bad thing and it\u2019s not ok to insult people because your but-hurt. If she wanted to wear a Barney suit that\u2019s her choice as well.\n\nAgain, how did this impact OP? Why was it so important? Because that\u2019s the one question you haven\u2019t been able to answer. \n\nShe didn\u2019t gloat! She wore what she wanted and didn\u2019t say anything. That\u2019s not gloating. She never said \u2018I told you so\u2019, he accused her of being a liar and then insulted her.", "How is it a dumb decision when she didn\u2019t regret it and looked good ? Like genuinely what about wearing heels is dumb ?", "Do you often get offended by what other people choose to wear cause you seemed genuinely pressed over something that literally has no effect on you or anyone else?", ">any medical professional would agree\n\nSources?", "She gloated by \"called (OP) an ah for not believing her\" that the heels were comfortable. \n\nWhy does she care so much if OP believes her? It's because she wants to be able to say \"I told you so\". It really doesn't impact her otherwise, and he didn't make her wear anything she didn't want to.", "Do some googling on whether wearing high heels for prolonged walking is a good idea. I always thought it was common sense, but if it isn't it would be good for you and OP's gf to learn about.", "I don't get offended by other people's dumb decisions. But I'm aware enough to recognize dumb decisions.", "Defending yourself from someone calling you/your actions dumb isn\u2019t gloating. I didn\u2019t think that I actually needed to explain that.\n\nShe walked in them for days, with no complaints AND outlasted him. OPs the complaining about her! Not the other way around. \n\nDon\u2019t be daft, the mere existence of a woman wearing heels is not gloating. The only reasonable explanation was she felt she was good, and no one but her would be able to give you an actual answer concerning her comfort. Not you, or OP. So why is he offended about her wearing heels? And why should she not be offended at her boyfriend calling her dumb. If someone calls you stupid are you not going to defend yourself? Or are you just going the lay there like wet mat and take someone talking down to you for no reason. Unless her heels created an issue, there was no need for him to make any comments. \n\nShe did nothing wrong in this scenario. His attitude about heels is his problem, not hers.", "And that makes her an asshole how ? Do you call people that drink soda assholes ? Do you call people that don\u2019t exercise regularly assholes ? What exactly about doing unhealthy things make someone dumb and an asshole", "You given no reason why its dumb just that its not *your* preference but still seem angry so yeah, you seem offended. Of course youre a stranger so its not my place to tell you how you feel but since thats what you seem to be doing with the gf, another stranger, I think its alright."]}
