She said her friend messaged her and said it was creepy. I apologised and promised to not wave again but I feel like that is a perfectly normal interaction?\n\nEdit\u2026 thanks everyone. I knew I wasn\u2019t going crazy and forgetting how social interactions work! After some of your suggestions I spoke to my daughter about the exact message and she said she can\u2019t remember exactly what it said and it\u2019s been deleted as it was on Snapchat. I think maybe she has exaggerated a bit. I mentioned that her friend might not want to visit in the future if she finds me creepy and she just brushed it off and said it doesn\u2019t matter. I think I will just let it be for now but keep an eye on it.

And I do.", "Since when does a wave at somebody you know count as hitting on them?", "Not even funny \nI think diddlers and weirdos should be gassed\nBut to suggest waving and saying hi makes you a creep is insane", "If friend said that. Possible she\u2019s exaggerating what friend said and added the creepy. Either way that girl would no longer he allowed in my house.", "Im assuming here that they are talking about themselves as an individual, as one would when having a talk like this with their own flesh and blood. He isnt saying 'men never do that' he is saying 'how could you think that I, YOUR FATHER would do that'", "Defensiveness? When his daughter goes along with someone calling her father a creep? They're family, not strangers.", "Methinks the creep doth protest too much...", "Negative.. the whole point is what someone on the outside could thing of when they hear 'Xs dad was being creepy to me' as gossip, also note Im not the person who wrote that, just one that understands what implications are and why they need to be curtailed when there's no inappropriateness happening.", "To be fair it wasn\u2019t the daughter who said something about it, she didn\u2019t even know. It was the friend who felt the need to say something about it.", "The very idea that parents exist *at all* is mortifying to teenagers. OP, it's definitely not personal.", "I thought so as well at first, but other commenters have a point when they say that the kid basically lied about OP being creepy for waving across the street, so OP should think about what the kid might say after being in OP\u2019s house.", "that was my thought. sorry hon' but if your friend finds me creepy, better that she not coem here, just in case she gets creeped out again.", "Sorry, it's the world we live in. OP needs to make sure to protect himself. A conversation needs to be had with friends parents before friend is allowed back into the house.", "Please actually say this OP", "Or even go the extra mile and say \u201cI don\u2019t want her parents to think I\u2019ve crossed a line, maybe I should call them just to clarify anything.\u201d And watch your kid shit herself.", "I agree with this 100% and if the daughter did add that part, it would be a good teaching moment that certain words hold more weight when it comes to negative connotations. Especially when dealing with an adult man and a teen girl, cringe and creepy are two vastly different things and the use of a wrong word can creat two different outcomes. \n\n15 is old enough to be held accountable for poor word usage imo.", "It doesn't, and that is the point, because it happens so much, it becames expected, that girl might have had interactions involving older man hitting on her before and her mind instantly thought he was doing the same.\n\nThere is no asshole here, the guy did nothing wrong, and the girl was dealing with whatever is her thing", "Your comment is pretty weird tbh, obviously OP didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I can\u2019t understand why the friend (or possible the daughter tbh) called him a creep. But no, not all young girls are half naked for internet points. You sounded like a \u201cnice guy\u201d with your comment.", "That's a possibility too. It sucks but she'll probably grow up one day and think back on it like \"omg why did I say that to my poor dad\". OP took it well and shouldn't think anymore of it", "It\u2019s entirely possible they just mean it in an \u201cEww, old people!\u201d way, not in a predatory way. Nothing indicates anyone said he was \u201cinterested\u201d in her, and reacting like that is over the top. Normal people don\u2019t get so aggressively defensive.", "That's what it sounds like from the story, but it could just be the daughter exaggerating things, like teenagers like to do. We've all done it \ud83d\ude04", "They just didn\u2019t grow up in eastern household", "\"And quite frankly I find it very disturbing of you that you want to bring your friend into the same house as someone she finds creepy so I am going to call her parents and tell them what a bad influence you are on her\"", "Please don\u2019t, it\u2019ll make the situation stickier.", "Why is accusing guys of being creepy for no reason a totally ok thing to do?", "Let's be real, you don't have pools in Ireland and the annual trip to the Guinness factory isn't a holiday.", "I get that, But that's your friends dad... Like, If someone messaged me and said \"OMG, Your dad's a creep.. I saw him earlier and he waved at me!\" I'd have said, \"Well, You don't need to worry about coming around anymore as you aren't welcome.\"\nThe connotation around the word 'Creep' can have horrendous effects on people's lives if the wrong people hear it as it means different things in different contexts and they clearly do not know how to utilise the word in the correct context so realistically, they shouldn't be using it.", "See, this guy gets it! Impeccable."]}
