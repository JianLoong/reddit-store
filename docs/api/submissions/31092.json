Protect yourself.", "NAH seems like a generational difference or potentially your daughter\u2019s friend has trauma that has nothing to do with you but she can\u2019t help it either. don\u2019t feel too guilty but maybe ask your daughter if she can explain to her friend that you had no intention of being creepy and, knowing her boundaries as you now do, you intend to do everything in your power to make her comfortable in your home and will not greet her or call attention to her outside of your home other than in a situation where, like, your daughter greeted her first or she greets you maybe. if you make a point out of taking this kid and her boundaries seriously it will make her more likely to relax around you and realise that this was a one-time misunderstanding. the last thing you want is for this friend to stop being comfortable coming around and then your daughter gets mad at you that she lost a friend, so just do your best to be patient and accommodating even if some things seem strange to you and normal to her or vice versa.", "NAH you were fine and her response was very typical for her age \ud83d\ude02 (not sure why all the N T A votes, are we really calling normal teenage reaction that of an A H?)", "NAH", "NTA, seems like you're just being nice.
