We're all remote but even when we were in the office, we had a peculiar way of doing lunch hours. We don't have set times. Since we're such a small department, roughly about 10 people in total-maximum 4 people on shift each day, we just claim our lunch hour in the morning via chat. The employees who have been here for years usually have a set time that we claim and those times are sort of verbally agreed upon as **our time.**\n\nI usually go last because my situation is a little unique. I'm T2 diabetic and for those who don't know, it's not recommended that diabetics starve themselves or hold off on eating when they're hungry. It can spike our sugars higher than it already is. So I set myself up to go last. That way, if I'm not hungry at that time, I can postpone my lunch in good conscience that everyone has already had their hour.\n\nThis morning, we started calling our lunch hours and I called mine as usual. The new employee privately messaged me, asking me to move my lunch hour because she wanted it so she can have lunches with her children. I wrote back (copied from our messages) \"I'm sorry but I need to keep my 4pm lunch hour. I'm diabetic and I need to eat on time to maintain my sugars.\" She wrote back to me asking that I be accommodating and understanding because she's a mother of 4 kids with a husband who is always working and she needs the lunch hour to dedicate her time to getting them fed. I reiterated that I cannot give her my lunch time and I am considering this conversation as over. She called me an asshole, saying that she knew I hated kids and if her kids don't eat on time, it's going to be my fault.\n\nWhile I know her kids not eating has nothing to do with me. But I have to ask, am I really an asshole for not accommodating her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your comments! I'm reading every comment! I'm working up the courage to report her to HR.

Her request is for convenience and yours is life or death.\n\nEdited a typo", "NTA.\n\nYour medical well-being trumps her wanting to have lunch with her kids.  She's acting entitled and it is quite astounding considering she's the new kid on the block.\n\nHowever, expect her to try to claim your lunch time earlier than your regular lunch time chat  and try to take it away from you.

I'd keep those messages, as I don't think this is the last conflict you're going to have with this new coworker and you'll want to keep the evidence.", "NTA.  Let's forget the diabetes issue for a moment--what we have here is a brand new hire demanding a seasoned employee accommodate her and then throwing a temper tantrum when those demands aren't met.

She can change when she feeds her kids. You can\u2019t change when you eat because you have a medical condition. I\u2019d contact HR and let them know of the situation before she makes some ridiculous claim.", "NTA. Keep records of this for HR purposes and consider getting a doctors note regarding your lunch hours to cover yourself in case she persists in her attitude.

A new employee who is already this entitled and hostile is not going to go away quietly.", "NTA - But talk to your supervisor ASAP. Diabetes is recognized under the ADA and making sure that you get a specific lunch hour is a reasonable accommodation that they should have to provide.", "NTA.  The children are important, but not as important as keeping you as healthy as possible.", "NTA - but if she makes it a thing, y'all can all kiss goodbye the chill method of how the lunch is structured, someone up above is NOT going to deal with this low level drama and just start scheduling it.

Why can't she feed them an hour earlier or later? 4PM seems like a very odd time to be having lunch or dinner anyways.

If you're not then I would push back hard- how dare you attempt to compromise my health for your convenience. You just got here. Your family time is not my priority, my health is.  And before you think about saying the words accommodating and understanding to me, you need to think about how those things apply in my context as well. You can apologize to me for your insults and then I won't take your messages and report you to HR for abusive behavior and we can start over.

It sounds like you have a good workplace environment. Someone like this will absolutely poison it. And don\u2019t think of this as your fault, because it is 100% not your fault. You didn\u2019t (I assume) lie about what occurred, her behavior was completely out of line and because of (again) her behavior she\u2019s in trouble. This is in no way on you."]}
