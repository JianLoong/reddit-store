We're all remote but even when we were in the office, we had a peculiar way of doing lunch hours. We don't have set times. Since we're such a small department, roughly about 10 people in total-maximum 4 people on shift each day, we just claim our lunch hour in the morning via chat. The employees who have been here for years usually have a set time that we claim and those times are sort of verbally agreed upon as **our time.**\n\nI usually go last because my situation is a little unique. I'm T2 diabetic and for those who don't know, it's not recommended that diabetics starve themselves or hold off on eating when they're hungry. It can spike our sugars higher than it already is. So I set myself up to go last. That way, if I'm not hungry at that time, I can postpone my lunch in good conscience that everyone has already had their hour.\n\nThis morning, we started calling our lunch hours and I called mine as usual. The new employee privately messaged me, asking me to move my lunch hour because she wanted it so she can have lunches with her children. I wrote back (copied from our messages) \"I'm sorry but I need to keep my 4pm lunch hour. I'm diabetic and I need to eat on time to maintain my sugars.\" She wrote back to me asking that I be accommodating and understanding because she's a mother of 4 kids with a husband who is always working and she needs the lunch hour to dedicate her time to getting them fed. I reiterated that I cannot give her my lunch time and I am considering this conversation as over. She called me an asshole, saying that she knew I hated kids and if her kids don't eat on time, it's going to be my fault.\n\nWhile I know her kids not eating has nothing to do with me. But I have to ask, am I really an asshole for not accommodating her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your comments! I'm reading every comment!
