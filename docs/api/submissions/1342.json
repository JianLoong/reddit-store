Moving in together after being long-distance is a big transition, especially at 18, I \\*highly\\* recommend seeing a couple's counselor, depending where you go to college you may be able to see one through the college for free or at least a reduced price. Hopefully he can recognize that the reason you keep nagging is because he keeps putting off basic responsibilities and that it sucks for you as much as it does for him, but he's the only one who can fix it by changing his behavior.", "If he has time to be on games then he has time to do the dishes, I\u2019d bet anything that he\u2019s just waiting until you cave and do the dishes and/or waiting for you to give up and stop asking him to do chores all together. It\u2019s not quite weaponized incompetence, but it\u2019s adjacent to it. Since you don\u2019t want to break up with him you\u2019ve got 2 options the way I see it:\n\n1\u2022cave and do the dishes\n\n2\u2022leave the dishes there and get *yourself* 1 bowl, 1 plate, 1 knife, 1 fork, 1 spoon that are yours; you clean them right after you use them and then put them somewhere he can\u2019t use them (get a camping dish set that\u2019s compact and keep it in your school bag if you have to). Then the lack of clean dishes only affects him. The kitchen\u2019s gonna start to smell and the quality of meals you have to eat will probably go down, but then those dishes stay there until he does them like he said he would. \n\nEither way NTA", "Seriously you are NTA. He's treating his work and his leisure as more important than yours. If he has time to game, then he has time to wash the dishes. I'd be tempted to keep a clean set of dishes for myself (wash them in the bathroom if you have to) and look all innocent when he doesn't have anything clean to eat from. Good Lord, is the hard work of feminists since the 1970s truly for nothing when 18 year old men still expect women to clean up after them?", "I know you're both 18, but he's not taking your time seriously. You need to sit down and talk with him about this and try to find a compromise. If he refuses then that is another personality difference you need to consider. Good luck.

Get used to living like this, or take over cleaning so that the house is always at level of cleanliness that you're comfortable with, since the level he is fine with bothers you so much.", "NAH - You and your BF are just too far apart in terms of the level of filth/clutter you can tolerate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
