He said everyone needed to pony up funds to help with this need to the tune of $27-35 / hr for 4-6 hrs per day. First of all, MIL receives SS and a savings we estimated being upwards of $150,000 from the sale of her house after building her MIL suite off the back of his house.

He's already started that off for you guys and if MIL is upset by this and demands to know why you don't speak with him let her know that your husband is apparently dead so can't.\n\nAlso even if MIL needed money for the nursing care if you don't have then you don't have it and can give when you are able to. it's not about want sometimes with money. \n\nBIL is a douche dumpling. Family is tough. Good luck! I hope your husband's health improves soon too.", "NTA.\n\n\"I'm dead to you? Why? Because I caught you lying, trying to scam us out of our money? You were a fool to imagine we wouldn't check what you were saying. Not sure if you are in financial trouble or something, but your behavior in this situation is vulgar and disappointing.\"", "Does the mom have power of attorney set up for healthcare and financials?!? If not this needs to be done asap!!", "Who the hell cares what your BIL thinks about anything?\n\nNTA", "NTA. And you should make sure Mom has control over her SS and other money and not BIL. He is likely to spend it on himself. Maybe find a finance planner and have them help with setting up her money to cover any expenses she may have for future medical issues. Maybe an annuity or some other secured instrument that he can't access. And an updated will.", "NTA. Sounds like bil was trying to scam you.", "Absolutely NTA. He was trying to scam you. Good news is now that you're fully aware of his motives and so is mom you don't have to feel guilty about wanting proof of any future expenses for mom. Medical procedure needed? Then you'll need doctor and hospital's numbers, email and records for example.", "NTA why would you be an A for calling a scammer out on their scam? Of course your BIL is mad, he wasn\u2019t able to trick you into giving him money. Good riddance!", "We have no interest in a relationship with him - and only maintained contact to this point because of the mother. My husband worries he won\u2019t know if something really happens to his mom - but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth all this drama.", "That\u2019s the plan!", "Seriously - a long one - off a short cliff. :) He\u2019s always been awful, but he ends his emails with a *bible verse* so that\u2019s convincing everyone he\u2019s a good guy, right? Just be a good guy. No manipulation necessary.", "Already done. We had cut ties with him several years ago and only opened the lines of communication at the mother\u2019s request. We told her this was the end - and that decision was final.", "Maybe, from now on, your husband should call his Mum every couple of days to stay in touch and to make sure she's alright. If they have a good relationship...But you're definitely NTA for checking in with your MiL.", "To add, your BiL threatened you with a very good time when he told his Brother, your husband, \"you're dead to me.\". Party on!", "NTA. I hope MIL cuts BIL out of the will. Scamming family is the lowest of the low", "Apparently he\u2019s on the verge of his 3rd bankruptcy. So yeah - after we confronted him about grifting us - he said we should give him at least $50/month for all that he does for his mother. HE agreed to do that. Not to mention will have all the massive improvements made to his home with her addition and all she has helped him with since moving in - he just wanted her money without any of the elder care involved in having a senior parent to deal with.", "Good Job!  Sometimes progress is challenging, but the reward is usually worth it.", "We are on a message thread and talk to her almost daily there and monthly face time calls, so we were pretty sure he was conning us."]}
