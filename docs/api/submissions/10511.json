He let her crying go on for almost an hour before explaining it to her and giving her pads.\n\nMy husband and I go on business trips that can keep us away for weeks at a time. When left for my last trip, brothers in law were visiting from out of state and apparently my husband and them deceid to turn the basement into a bedroom for my stepson.\n\nThe result is a much larger, nicer room for my stepson, as a reward for what I view as sexism.\n\nHe was proud to show me when I returned what he and his brothers had done, like I'd be happy or impressed.\n\nNow my husband has gone a weeks long trip and I have put a lock on the door tovthe basement so my stepson can't move in.
