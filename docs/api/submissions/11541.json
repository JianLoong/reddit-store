But he seems like he wants you to be healthy and safe. \n\n>My dad is currently on Keto, but I don't understand why I have to be involved, even though he claims he's not forcing me to do it too. \n\n\n\n1) Keto is a lifestyle choice, it isn't a diet. When you commit to it, the first thing they tell you is not to have anything non-keto in the house. So he, in fact, isn't forcing his diet on you. He is adhering to a lifestyle choice and requiring you to if you live in his home. And he's your parent. He has to serve you, you don't have to eat it.\n\n\n>My food options go down even further because I have sensory issues, so I can't eat lots of foods without gagging.\n\nSo Keto should actually be very helpful to you. Being as you have worse issues than keto and all.\n\n>He acts like I'm overreacting, even though I literally can't eat some foods without feeling sick\n\n2) Would you expect him not to? This whole post is an \"I Hate Dad\" over *food* that you have to put in your stomach. And good food, too, if you have dietary restrictions like this!! \n\n>yet he insists on checking my work and berating me for any mistakes, forcing me to do it again until it's all correct.\n\n3) I know this is hard for you. This is why I have a hard time posting judgment. I realise you probably get straight A's because he makes fix the wrong answers. But berating you is wrong, and there are easier ways of showing kids that they have more to learn. I've tried not to berate you here, and if you feel I am, read with a softer tone. I'm no demon, honey.\n\n>Most doors (except for bathroom doors) have to remain unlocked all the time. \n\nWell, of course they do. But I'm sure they can be shut. Did you know it's actually *extremely dangerous* to lock doors that have a metal turn lock in a fire? Doorknobs can be worse. There is a host of reasons he might not want doors locked... We don't live in your house. And I say that with the experience of someone that almost got hurt very badly rescuing her disabled sister in a *locked bathroom*\n\nETA: I wanted to save my work quickly.\n\nI realize you're probably a teenager, from reading this I would say 15-17 year old.\n. You didn't give us that information, but I do my best not to guess gender. Look. I know you want me to sit here and say that your dad is the bad guy, but I can't really do that.\n\nWhat I can do is tell you that he at least cares about you, and no one can tell you that you are wrong for voicing your feelings. You needed to do it better, maybe, but he's also not wrong to be hurt by your words. \n\nYou may consider trying to sit down and talk to him about this post and come to a compromise on things. I think both of you will be pleasantly surprised, especially when he lets you look outside the Keto foods, and you see that 90% of non-keto has more than 10g of sugar. Keto is the healthy version of the crap the rest of us eat. Including pancakes, pizza, and candy corn. The candy corn was an interesting achievement. I was impressed.\n\nNAH", "Um... NAH\n\nHe's looking out for your health. Bite your tongue until you move out. I'm assuming you're a child, so it's okay to have one strict parent. But again, you'll move out sooner or later. Also, I'm assuming that's why you said you favored your mother to your father in a fit of anger. Maybe just chill out a little.\n\nEdit, INFO : Abd you talk like he doesn't understand your food issues, so I wonder. Does he not know much about your dietary restrictions? Is there any reason for this?", "DING DING DING. You'd be correct about him not changing his behavior. I've recently talked about it a little with my mum and I don't want to completely stop visiting since he can be okay sometimes. This controlling behaviour only becomes a real problem when I stay for more than a week (I typically stay for three). \n\nIt becomes real annoying (and damaging to my mental health) when I gotta live on five minute noodles and lasagna for a while. I'm going over to him in a month or so, but only for a week. \n\nAlso thank you everyone you've confirmed I'm not being a brat and/or going insane.", "Good point about ARFID, but I am autistic and the two can be quite similar in some aspects. Either way I'll look into it, thanks!", ">Keto is a lifestyle choice, it isn't a diet. When you commit to it, the first thing they tell you is not to have anything non-keto in the house.\n\nWell that's nice if everyone in your house agrees but he made this choice for his kid.

When we haven't bought anything yet??", "No, but you might need to have a sit down with your dad that he needs to stop pushing his diet on you or you'll report it. Mom, CPS, court, whatever. He is welcome to do as he pleases. \n\nMaybe you can ask your mom to let you bring your own food and do your own cooking.

As for the dietary restrictions, while it is good to consume things in moderation, his rigid guidelines cut out major food groups that can alter your microbiome & effect on your relationship with food as you age; you need to be able to moderate your food intake yourself.", "NTA, and let me correct you, OP - he is NOT doing any of this to help you.
