They weren\u2019t invited to my wedding and they are lucky I told them my wife and I are having a baby. \n\nEver since I came out and started testosterone, my dad is even more competitive. Around me and my sister, he wants us to compete to see who can get the waitresses number, who is the best at trivia, sports, etc. My sister is a lesbian and unfortunately isn\u2019t a good person.

In the past when she has asked, she shows my dad without permission and they rank, then act weird if my partner is hot. \n\nI told her no. She kept asking. I said no.

I said she can meet my wife when we are all at Thanksgiving. \n\nAITA for not participating in this?\n\nEditing cause many people asked: I visit twice a year to see my nieces. I try to spend quality time with them and ignore my parents. Last time I saw them for Christmas, my dad called my three year old niece fat. And shamed her while I held her. I looked at her and told her that I love her no matter her body size, she\u2019s beautiful, and just the right weight. Her face went from sad to happy. Due to the addictions that run in my family. I\u2019ve been mentioned as a potential guardian, so it\u2019s a fine line I have to walk. Previous years I was more apart of my nieces life. Taking care of her when she was a newborn and to one year. It came with visiting my family.", "created_utc": 1667170502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhsu48/aita_for_not_sending_my_sister_a_photo_of_my_wife/", "score": 735, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
