You\u2019re not an A H for trying to talk your mom out of this, but it\u2019s your mom\u2019s kiddo. Just like she picked your name, she absolutely CAN give your sister any name she wants because that\u2019s her DAUGHTER. Stop trying. The more you poke, push, and prod, the more likely she is to be stuck on that name. \n\nIf it\u2019s really super terrible, little sis can always go by a nickname.

He thinks maybe a third of people know who Artemis is. He says he didn't know her until he met me. I have to apologize.
