{"id": 12887, "submission_id": "11y4epn", "title": "AITA for threatening to call the cops on the person who gave my underage son alcohol?", "selftext": "Preface: I live in the US. Drinking age is 21. I understand in different countries it differs, but this is law where I am.\n\nAlso, some context. When my kids were younger, they had an amazing babysitter, Allie. She\u2019s only 10 years older than my oldest (Faith) and 12 years older than my youngest (Tim) My husband and I viewed her as a daughter figure, and she told us several times that she thought of us as parents.\n\nNow, our kids are 18 and 16. Faith is several states away at college and ended up being rushed to the hospital. It was pretty bad, so my husband and I decided to go be with her, help out and potentially bring her home should it get there.\n\nThe issue was Tim had a few very important exams at school as well as work, so he couldn\u2019t come. We have no family in the area, so we asked if Allie could stay with him for a few days, basically make sure that he\u2019s alright. We\u2019re also not dumb. Tim is a good kid, but we\u2019ve all seen one too many sitcom episodes where parents go away and a party gets thrown. Ally agreed. \n\nWe returned 4 days later after our daughter was cleared. Later that afternoon, a friend sent me a TikTok which showed Tim drunk. A lot of kids his age were around and also clearly under the influence. I confronted Tim right away and he came clean. He explained that he was having friends over, which we did expect and were okay with. However, someone bought him alcohol and it got out of control.\n\nI called Allie and asked where she was the night of the party. She said she was at her friend\u2019s house because she didn\u2019t want to intrude on Tim\u2019s friends. I mentioned alcohol and she got super defensive before finally admitting that she supplied the alcohol before leaving.\n\nI am livid with both her and Tim. While I understand teens may drink, they put myself and my husband at risk. If someone got hurt, we\u2019d be liable even if we weren\u2019t home. Parents could\u2019ve sued us. \n\nWe\u2019re speaking with Tim about drinking responsibly, the laws around it and how much trouble he could get himself and others in. A talk we already had but I guess it didn\u2019t sink in.  He was also grounded. \n\nAllie tried to downplay it. I pointed out I have plenty of evidence that she supplied alcohol and threatened to call the police. She freaked out and said I was overreacting. \n\nMy husband is trying to convince me to not file a report. He says we should just cut Allie off and move on. But I feel this shouldn\u2019t go unpunished.

Totally out of line. \n\nA 21 year old thinking it's a good idea to supply to underage kids is silly but understandable. But to do it in your late 20s? Just irresponsible. \n\nBUT calling the cops is also totally ridiculous. She doesn't need to be charged, you just want to vent your anger.

You have every right to be livid and I think it\u2019s fair enough to file a report, especially considering this is YOUR CHILD that someone else has betrayed your trust of. But honestly, I would suggest not filing a report, simply because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be effective or resolve anything. Simply cut that person out of your life, reinstate boundaries for your children, and continue on with life.", "ESH. Allie should never have done it but honestly the threat is enough.\nTeenagers drink sometimes and I totally get where you\u2019re coming from but calling the cops isn\u2019t going to take back the fact that your so has tried alcohol. What will her going to jail solve?", "ESH. My older siblings got me drunk when I was 15. It\u2019s a shitty rite of passage, but what if it was your daughter buying alcohol for your son? Would you call the police? I\u2019m going to guess not. On one hand you want to treat Allie like one of your own kids, and on the other, you want to punish her for having that kind of big sister relationship with your kids. \n\nBe thankful nothing bad happened but only call the cops if you\u2019d do the same if it was your daughter in the situation.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for threatening her with the cops, I personally think it may be the wake-up call she needed. \n\nWhere I\u2019m from 16 year olds are allowed to drink wine and beer, and 18 year olds are allowed to drink everything, so I don\u2019t find it outrageous when a 16 year old consumes alcohol, but I would never supply a group of teens with alcohol and then just leave them to it. That\u2019s super dangerous. \n\nI do however think you would be T A if you actually went through with it and went to the police. It was shitty of her to do what she did, but no one actually got hurt and she\u2019ll hopefully know better in the future", "NTA, but YWBTA if you actually do call the police. It won't help anything, and could ruin Ally's future.", "Edit: Okay, I somehow missed Allie\u2019s age. That changes my perspective some. Response updated accordingly. \n\nNTA\u2026for being upset. What Allie did was  completely inappropriate and a breach of your trust. While it is also illegal, whether you report it to the police is a personal choice that should take into a variety of considerations. For example, do you think this is a one time lapse in judgment or do you think Allie is prone to other risky behaviors? Do you think your finding out is enough to deter Allie from doing this again? Do you think the offense is serious enough to warrant criminal consequences? In my state, this is a class H felony which is punishable up to 3 years in prison, 3 years extended supervision and a $10,000 fine. That kind of a sentence can ruin a life, make a person unemployable in the future, etc. You have to balance your anger, interests in protecting your son and others, and your relationship with Allie to decide what is appropriate. Other actions that don\u2019t involve reporting to the police could be equally effective, depending on your answers to the above. \n\nOne thing to consider is that it\u2019s unlikely this is Tim\u2019s first time drinking. These days, many kids have had their first drink around that time or even sooner. It\u2019s also unlikely that this was Allie\u2019s idea, or that she was intending to prey on youth with her actions. It\u2019s more likely Tim begged Allie to purchase alcohol for him\u2026because HE saw an opportunity and he had prior experience. Other adults (siblings, older friends, parents of friends) would have had to be participants in these activities, whether at the urging of Tim or others in his company. It seems to me that the most immediate issue is educating and establishing clear expectations for Tim. While \u201cdon\u2019t drink\u201d is an acceptable boundary to establish, it\u2019s likely Tim will do it again. So include guidance on how Tim can make safe decisions if he finds himself in this position again.", "INFO- Did you pay Allie to watch your kid or did she do it as a daughter figure? That changes the dynamic a lot here.", "ESH and you suck extra for arguing with everyone here telling you something you don\u2019t want to hear.", "YTA. IME the police aren\u2019t always the friendly types you expect and often make a situation worse. You\u2019ve had a conversation with her. Also real talk your son would\u2019ve probably just bribed someone at a gas station to buy for them and has friends who know how to do that. And uh\u2026 why did your 16 yo need a babysitter? Did I read something wrong?", "YTA because you only want to call the cops on Allie. I'd be pissed as hell at Allie and never ask her to babysit again. But your son broke the law, too. Why aren't you reporting HIM to the juvenile court? Your son didn't sit there with a halo over his head, begging Allie to stop trying to pour beer down his throat. If you call the cops on Allie but think that Darling Widdle Timmy-Poo doesn't need delinquency charges because he's \"learned his lesson\", you're a giant gaping diarrhea-encrusted asshole.\n\nETA: I used to work in a juvenile court and have multiple relatives who are cops. Quite a few of the probation officers and cops I've known, if you told them this story, they would automatically file complaints against both Allie AND Tim. After all, you just provided them with a confession that Tim committed underage consumption. So, again...if you want to go to the cops, you need to accept that Tim is just as deserving of legal punishment as Allie.", "ESH. She should not have given your kid alcohol, but do you really think a 16-year old kid having a party is t going to get his hands on alcohol? If she had not provided it one of his friends almost certainly would. Allie saved your ass when you had to go away. If you are pissed, don\u2019t use her for a babysitter again. Trying to have her arrested would move this front and e-s-h to a you are the asshole.", "ESH. She shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't be trying to ruin her life over it.", "Okay so your Allie is not 21 or 22, she's 28. She's a whole ass grown adult. There's no excuse for her to be buying alcohol for a bunch of 16 year olds. Lots of people get alcohol for their underage friends when they're close in age, and while that's not advisable, it makes more sense. A 28 year old knows better. Any good babysitter or older sibling role keeps tabs on the younger one and makes sure they don't drink too much and have a glass of water or something.\n\n**You also included this comment:**\n\n*\"I paid her. $25/hr for the hours that she\u2019d actually be around him and then a $250/day retainer to guarantee availability if he went home sick, there was an emergency, etc. She made $2000 for those 4 days.\"*\n\n\nWhatcha wanna bet that the money that you gave her ended up paying for the alcohol she bought him? You literally **paid** her to keep tabs on him and make sure he was doing well and she gave him the means to put him and his friends in a potentially dangerous scenario and then left him alone. \n\nWhile I agree you shouldn't call the cops as that's over the line, definitely NTA. You need to have a serious talk with her and maybe ask for that $2000 back.\n\nEdit: mistyped as daughter not babysitter, got the roles confused. Fixed and judgement still stands", "What\u2019s it like being perfect OP?", "NTA atm but no need to file anything. Freaking kids out is pretty traumatic for them and calling the cops isn't going to fix anything. I'd say giving your kid the talk was all that needed to be done.", "ESH. It wasn\u2019t really her place to be buying your 16yo alcohol, but, at the same time, I get the feeling that if your son asked you or your husband to buy him and his friends alcohol you would say absolutely not. At least the teens were drinking somewhere safe and had a trusted adult they could call if something went wrong, unlike my partner and his friends when they were in high school where they would go out to a field in the woods around a bonfire to drink underage and none of their parents or any other adults knew about it lol.", "NTA for being upset but you would be the AH if you press charges. You've also made it/will make it clear to him that you'll go nuclear when something upsets you so don't expect him to reach out to you when he's stuck somewhere without a sober ride or if he gets himself into a situation where he needs you. You're teaching him that he can't trust you, and that you care more about the breaking of rules than his own safety in that kind of scenario.", "NTA I understand your anger and frustration. But I think your husband is right on this one. I think you have put the fear of God in Alli and your son.", "Yeah YTA here. You have an 18 year old kid. He's going to want to explore, drink, and throw/attend parties. The question you need to ask yourself right now is what do you want him to do if/when he gets himself in too deep. Do you want him to call you for help? Or do you want him to fear you and try to drive home drunk to avoid you finding out or \"walk off\" an overdose?\n\nYou aren't teaching him to make smarter decisions because he doesn't have a safe place to explore them. You are teaching him to hide his decisions from you better. \n\nHonestly that babysitter could end up being a lifesaver because she's built trust with your son and there's a good chance that he would call her before he did something really stupid.", "YTA - your husband is right, just cut allie off and move on. You are using a very disproportionate response to a slight mistake anyone could've committed (let's face it, your son is at fault too and he could've gotten any older friend to buy if allie wasn't around).

You make sure they don't drink so much that they get alcohol poisoning, that if they pass out they're in the recovery position and someone is checking on them regularly, that no one takes advantage of them, they don't try to drive anywhere, and that they don't make any permanent mistakes. That's the whole point of the rite of passage - so that later, when they're drinking around strangers, they have some experience under their belt and are more likely to be safe. \n\nIf Allie had done that, I'd be on her side. The kids want to party, okay, buy them a couple beers and hang out and make sure they're safe. Better at home with you right now than with skeezy upperclassmen at college in a couple years. \n\nBut she bought a group of minors alcohol and then *left*. That's so much worse.

It's not unheard of that the older sibling would buy alcohol for the younger one and fk off somewhere else doing their own thing. Or the young kid would insist and since they had built some form of trust over the years, the adult would cave in believing things would be handled fine. Bad judgement call, sure. Irresponsible, sure. I doubt the parents would get them jailed for that though.\n\nIt is also pretty obvious that it wasn't HER who \"decided to get the kids drunk\" - overreaching again on your part.
