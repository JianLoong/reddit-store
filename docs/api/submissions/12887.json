I understand in different countries it differs, but this is law where I am.\n\nAlso, some context. When my kids were younger, they had an amazing babysitter, Allie. She\u2019s only 10 years older than my oldest (Faith) and 12 years older than my youngest (Tim) My husband and I viewed her as a daughter figure, and she told us several times that she thought of us as parents.\n\nNow, our kids are 18 and 16. Faith is several states away at college and ended up being rushed to the hospital. It was pretty bad, so my husband and I decided to go be with her, help out and potentially bring her home should it get there.\n\nThe issue was Tim had a few very important exams at school as well as work, so he couldn\u2019t come. We have no family in the area, so we asked if Allie could stay with him for a few days, basically make sure that he\u2019s alright. We\u2019re also not dumb. Tim is a good kid, but we\u2019ve all seen one too many sitcom episodes where parents go away and a party gets thrown. Ally agreed. \n\nWe returned 4 days later after our daughter was cleared. Later that afternoon, a friend sent me a TikTok which showed Tim drunk. A lot of kids his age were around and also clearly under the influence. I confronted Tim right away and he came clean. He explained that he was having friends over, which we did expect and were okay with. However, someone bought him alcohol and it got out of control.\n\nI called Allie and asked where she was the night of the party. She said she was at her friend\u2019s house because she didn\u2019t want to intrude on Tim\u2019s friends. I mentioned alcohol and she got super defensive before finally admitting that she supplied the alcohol before leaving.\n\nI am livid with both her and Tim. While I understand teens may drink, they put myself and my husband at risk. If someone got hurt, we\u2019d be liable even if we weren\u2019t home. Parents could\u2019ve sued us. \n\nWe\u2019re speaking with Tim about drinking responsibly, the laws around it and how much trouble he could get himself and others in. A talk we already had but I guess it didn\u2019t sink in.  He was also grounded. \n\nAllie tried to downplay it. I pointed out I have plenty of evidence that she supplied alcohol and threatened to call the police. She freaked out and said I was overreacting. \n\nMy husband is trying to convince me to not file a report. He says we should just cut Allie off and move on. But I feel this shouldn\u2019t go unpunished.

Simply cut that person out of your life, reinstate boundaries for your children, and continue on with life.", "ESH.

Would you call the police? I\u2019m going to guess not.

Frankly, it\u2019s unlikely this is Tim\u2019s first time drinking. It\u2019s more likely he begged Allie to purchase alcohol for him\u2026because HE saw an opportunity and he had prior experience.

Did I read something wrong?", "YTA because you only want to call the cops on Allie. I'd be pissed as hell at Allie and never ask her to babysit again. But your son broke the law, too. Why aren't you reporting HIM to the juvenile court? Your son didn't sit there with a halo over his head, begging Allie to stop trying to pour beer down his throat. If you call the cops on Allie but think that Darling Widdle Timmy-Poo doesn't need delinquency charges because he's \"learned his lesson\", you're a giant gaping diarrhea-encrusted asshole.\n\nETA: I used to work in a juvenile court and have multiple relatives who are cops. Quite a few of the probation officers and cops I've known, if you told them this story, they would automatically file complaints against both Allie AND Tim. After all, you just provided them with a confession that Tim committed underage consumption. So, again...if you want to go to the cops, you need to accept that Tim is just as deserving of legal punishment as Allie.", "ESH. She should not have given your kid alcohol, but do you really think a 16-year old kid having a party is t going to get his hands on alcohol?

There's no excuse for her to be buying alcohol for a bunch of 16 year olds. Lots of people get alcohol for their underage friends when they're close in age, and while that's not advisable, it makes more sense. A 28 year old knows better.

You literally **paid** her to keep tabs on him and make sure he was doing well and she gave him the means to put him and his friends in a potentially dangerous scenario and then left him alone. \n\nWhile I agree you shouldn't call the cops as that's over the line, definitely NTA. You need to have a serious talk with her and maybe ask for that $2000 back.", "What\u2019s it like being perfect OP?", "NTA atm but no need to file anything.

It wasn\u2019t really her place to be buying your 16yo alcohol, but, at the same time, I get the feeling that if your son asked you or your husband to buy him and his friends alcohol you would say absolutely not.

You've also made it/will make it clear to him that you'll go nuclear when something upsets you so don't expect him to reach out to you when he's stuck somewhere without a sober ride or if he gets himself into a situation where he needs you. You're teaching him that he can't trust you, and that you care more about the breaking of rules than his own safety in that kind of scenario.", "NTA I understand your anger and frustration. But I think your husband is right on this one. I think you have put the fear of God in Alli and your son.", "Yeah YTA here. You have an 18 year old kid. He's going to want to explore, drink, and throw/attend parties. The question you need to ask yourself right now is what do you want him to do if/when he gets himself in too deep.

Or do you want him to fear you and try to drive home drunk to avoid you finding out or \"walk off\" an overdose?\n\nYou aren't teaching him to make smarter decisions because he doesn't have a safe place to explore them.

You make sure they don't drink so much that they get alcohol poisoning, that if they pass out they're in the recovery position and someone is checking on them regularly, that no one takes advantage of them, they don't try to drive anywhere, and that they don't make any permanent mistakes. That's the whole point of the rite of passage - so that later, when they're drinking around strangers, they have some experience under their belt and are more likely to be safe. \n\nIf Allie had done that, I'd be on her side. The kids want to party, okay, buy them a couple beers and hang out and make sure they're safe. Better at home with you right now than with skeezy upperclassmen at college in a couple years. \n\nBut she bought a group of minors alcohol and then *left*. That's so much worse.

The babysitter relationship makes things a lil weird however at 16 and 18 years old your kids knew what they were doing. They just so happen had someone able to purchase it legally, but that wouldn\u2019t have stopped them if they were trying to drink. I used to steal 30-racks and bottles every week from the grocery store. It\u2019s not right, but if your kids are 16 and let\u2019s not forget literally also 18 years old, they made their choice.

There\u2019s a whole lot of what ifs and could\u2019ve/should\u2019ve here but in the end did those kids you were worried about get hurt?

And that after that, you will be suing her for $2000 in small claims court, which she is likely to lose as well.\n\nIf she says she spent that money already, have her donate $100 or more a month until that $2000 is fully donated.\n\nTell her this is not a negotiation. If she even tries to contact your son (to have him recant his confession), either directly or indirectly through friends, or if she doesn't send proof of her $100+ donation within 48 hours, you're going directly to the police and the DA.\n\n48 hours during weekdays is good, because it should give her enough time to get a free consultation with a criminal defense lawyer.

As the absent \"host\" parents, having this documented through email might help you if the other parents decide to report you to the police.\n\nIn the meantime, the son needs to be punished as well. May be temporarily take away all his electronics and have him do extra chores. And only call Allie when the son is not around to overhear.

America is very car centric and drunk driving is a killer. \n\nThe difference between an unrelated adult buying children alcohol and leaving them with no supervision and a parent allowing kids to have a supervised party is astronomical.

The person you employed didnt stop it, she actively encouraged it, wasn't their to supervise and supplied the alcohol. If she was staying there as a guest and turned a blind eye to it is one thing, but she was there purely to stop this from happening. She made it happen by giving the go ahead and supplying the alcohol. She took advantage of you. Her presence in your home, the understanding of why she was n your home was solely based on doing the job of stopping parties. That was all she was needed for. She betrayed you completely and lied to you. For this reason, the fact she was in your home to stop the partying, yes I would report her. She massively broke her word and verbal agreement. If you dont do that you certainly need to sue her for the money.", "You can tell reddit has a huge community of children and teenagers.\n\nNTA.

She had no right to be serving your son and his friends alcohol.\n\nFor the people saying \"well why isn't he responsible\" uh hello? That's why Allie was there. Because he's 16. He is *not* an adult with a completely developed brain. There was no liquor in the house until Allie brought it over and left it with him. Yes, he did drink it, *because he's a teenager*, again, if Allie didn't bring him and his friends alcohol, this wouldn't even be a post.\n\nYou're NTA OP, even if you do report her.
