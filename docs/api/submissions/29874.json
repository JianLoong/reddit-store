Oral herpes is so common, and for the most part benign, they don\u2019t even test for in STD panels. At least half the population of pretty much every country is estimated to have it and you can get from your grandma kissing you as a baby.\n\nNTA. He may have had it for decades and be like the majority of people who don\u2019t experience regular outbreaks.", "Um, noooo.\n\nNTA, but dont let him kiss you on the lips when he has an active flare up. It will be even more awkward to explain to your friends, that your dad gave you herpes.", "I get fever blisters, cold sores, whatever. And I hate them. So, I don't play games and don't drink from other people's glasses, bottles, whatever. The virus has a really short life span, though. So, its me - not the glasses, bottles and jars. I am just likely hyper vigilant. \n\nAsk your dad where else his mouth has been because you have no active sores and obviously he did not get a mouth sore from you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nHowever, I don\u2019t think that you have a firm understanding of herpes, cold sores, etc. Even if you had a cold sore when you were at, if that is in fact what it was, your father knew about it. Therefore, he should\u2019ve been more mindful. Frankly, he remembered that you had a cold sore when you were eight enough to latch onto the idea that you\u2019re the one that gave him herpes. \nAlso, a significant number of adults have Herpes Type 1, which causes cold sores. People don\u2019t exhibit symptoms very often, if at all. So it\u2019s not always as obvious that you are having an outbreak as it might seem. You could have a sore inside your mouth that you\u2019re not really noticing. It\u2019s possible that you were contagious at that moment in time, however, it\u2019s unlikely. \nGenital herpes is something else altogether. It is Herpes Type 2. It\u2019s a sexually transmitted disease. They can do testing to determine which type of herpes simplex type he has your post was a clear on that so I\u2019m not sure whether he just has a cold sore or he has \u201cdown there.\u201d It\u2019s a sexually transmitted disease. They can do testing to determine which type of herpes simplex type he has. Your post wasn\u2019t clear on that so I\u2019m not sure whether he just has a cold sore or he has herpes \u201cdown there.\u201d I don\u2019t know about everyone else but that\u2019s an important factoid that I would like clarification on. Because if he\u2019s claiming to have acquired a sexually transmitted disease through your drinking glass, then that\u2019s absurd. \nAt the end of the day, there is a possibility, if not a probability that you would\u2019ve transferred your cold sore to him at some point over your lifetime. It\u2019s extremely common. If he just developed a cold sore, that doesn\u2019t mean that he got it from your glass last week. He could\u2019ve gotten it from your glass 10 years ago and it\u2019s only manifesting now. So there are a lot of flaws in his logic. At the end of the day, Herpes Type 1 or cold sores are very common and a lot of people get them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for him to \u201cblame\u201d you. However, just like you may not have a firm bras on how all of the stuff works, he may not either. So I wouldn\u2019t be too upset with him because he\u2019s ignorant on the subject. Lots of people don\u2019t understand herpes and that\u2019s common too. Don\u2019t let your feelings about this situation with the girlfriend, color or interfere with how you see the possible (or not) transmission of herpes. You may be quick to blame the girlfriend based on some implied misgivings you have about their relationship. I recommend being aware of that possibility so that you are seeing all the details of the situation with clarity. \nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad. If you do have a history of a cold sore that doesn\u2019t really mean anything. You have nothing to feel bad about in this situation, as far as I can see.", "NTA. I think we all know how he got herpes.", "The doctor is wrong about not being able to get it from sharing drinks, and couldn't have possibly cleared OP unless they actually tested for HSV1 and 2, which I truly doubt they did. OP said themself that they've had a cold sore in the past, which is from HSV1, herpes.", "You are correct about this.", "\"So you have herpes\"\n\nHow can you know OP has herpes?", "Where has dear old dad been putting his face? It seems highly unlikely that he got that short lived virus from his daughter's water bottle?\ud83e\udd23", "Eeeew id never kiss a parent on the lips", "Do you take a lysine supplement daily? It really helps prevent outbreaks. I take one every day and I haven't had a breakout in over a year.", "OP didn\u2019t get tested by their doc, and it\u2019s extremely rare to clear a herpes infection.  I suppose I could\u2019ve said that it\u2019s 99.99% certain OP has herpes, but at that point\u2026what\u2019s the point?  OP has herpes.", "Depends on your culture but herpes dad...ew no way", "I do, but not daily. Its hard on my stomach.  It seemed like my relationship with mouth sores got much better when I stopped actively working in the early childhood wing of our school buildings. I might be wrong, but I have less contact with the little ones and they get everything and bring it to school, plus you work in much closer contact with them because they are so small.", "I hadn\u2019t heard about taking lysine for this. I get an outbreak every time I\u2019m stressed so I\u2019m going to have to start this. Thanks for the tip.", "But where did OP say she ever had the virus?\n\nShe said she had a sore on her lip when she was 8 years old, not that the sore was from herpes", "As ridiculous as this sounds to people - so do I. Stress exacerbates everything.", "If she had a cold sore when she was eight then she has herpes. They\u2019re the same thing.\nEDIT: But she only said a \u201csore\u201d not a cold sore so I\u2019m connecting dots of my own there.", "Cold sores are herpes. As are chickenpox, mono, epstein-barr virus.\n\nUsually HSV1 (herpes simplex virus 1) causes cold sores, but it can also be from HSV2 (which is usually associated with genital herpes)", "If it wasn\u2019t a cold sore, why would OP have mentioned it?  So obviously, OP meant she had a cold sore then.  Ergo, she got herpes 1 when she was 8, and humans can\u2019t clear herpes, so she has herpes.", "Yes, unfortunately it does"]}
