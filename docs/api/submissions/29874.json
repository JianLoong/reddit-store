Therefore, he should\u2019ve been more mindful. Frankly, he remembered that you had a cold sore when you were eight enough to latch onto the idea that you\u2019re the one that gave him herpes. \nAlso, a significant number of adults have Herpes Type 1, which causes cold sores. People don\u2019t exhibit symptoms very often, if at all. So it\u2019s not always as obvious that you are having an outbreak as it might seem. You could have a sore inside your mouth that you\u2019re not really noticing. It\u2019s possible that you were contagious at that moment in time, however, it\u2019s unlikely. \nGenital herpes is something else altogether. It is Herpes Type 2.

Your post wasn\u2019t clear on that so I\u2019m not sure whether he just has a cold sore or he has herpes \u201cdown there.\u201d I don\u2019t know about everyone else but that\u2019s an important factoid that I would like clarification on. Because if he\u2019s claiming to have acquired a sexually transmitted disease through your drinking glass, then that\u2019s absurd. \nAt the end of the day, there is a possibility, if not a probability that you would\u2019ve transferred your cold sore to him at some point over your lifetime. It\u2019s extremely common. If he just developed a cold sore, that doesn\u2019t mean that he got it from your glass last week. He could\u2019ve gotten it from your glass 10 years ago and it\u2019s only manifesting now. So there are a lot of flaws in his logic. At the end of the day, Herpes Type 1 or cold sores are very common and a lot of people get them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for him to \u201cblame\u201d you. However, just like you may not have a firm bras on how all of the stuff works, he may not either. So I wouldn\u2019t be too upset with him because he\u2019s ignorant on the subject. Lots of people don\u2019t understand herpes and that\u2019s common too. Don\u2019t let your feelings about this situation with the girlfriend, color or interfere with how you see the possible (or not) transmission of herpes.

I recommend being aware of that possibility so that you are seeing all the details of the situation with clarity. \nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad.

Men can have active herpes and not even know about it which is why it.  More than 50% of the world population have the HSZ-1 virus and i believe its around 10-15% worldwide for HSV-2 (I could be won't but I'm sure that's what I was told).  Unfortunately, I'm talking from personal experience. \n\nTo stress how common it is,  there are even dating sites specifically for those with the herpes virus (I'm NOT talking from experience on this one lol).", "Just a small correction - herpes can't be \"cleared\". The virus kinda nests in centers of your nervous system and stays dormant there, and that's for life. When an outbreak happens it traveles through the nervous system to the lips/genitals/other places in rare occasions, depending on where the infection point was (it doesn't travel freely across your body, well at least not the common ones).\n\nIt is indeed very rare to get it when no symptoms occur but not impossible. In any case, while it isn't a pleasant experience, it's not really dangerous.\n\nDoctors have a tendency to somewhat dismiss the whole thing to avoid creating panic, which is a bit weird, saying it's \"impossible\" cuz the concensus is that you shouldn't build your life around the infection", "I literally got herpes / cold sores from drinking my friends water bottle who had an active cold sore breakout.", "I agree with the explanation. Also, my doctor told me 20 years ago that you cannot test for herpes unless you have an active sore at that moment. Yes, you will always carry that virus for the rest of your life, but if it's dormant, you can't test for it. However, that may have changed in the last 20 years. \n\nQuestion: we're taking about the herpes simplex virus, right? The one you can get from drinking from the same can, bottle or glass as someone with an active sore? Not genital herpes, which is an STD? Or does OPs dad have an STD now and he's blaming his daughter? That would be hilarious.\n\nI'm voting NTA here though, because by blaming someone else for getting a virus makes the father the ah.", "You can still shed the virus even if you don\u2019t have symptoms or an obvious outbreak. This is false info.", "It could also be that OP is misinterpreting it. The virus doesn't survive long on a plastic bottle, so it's quite unlikely to be shared that way", "it has a forever lifespan. it just goes into latency.", "Yep - that is often the case, people don't know they carry and possibly shed the virus for ages til the circumstances are right. Stress, Sun, suppressed immune system for any reason....", "Yep. My parents both had cold sores when I was a kid. Never had one myself, but it\u2019s probably reasonable that I have it too. My gyno doesn\u2019t even test for herpes on a full panel because almost everyone has it", "Though, fun fact, you can actually transmit HSV1 during sex to, you know, non-mouth places.", "It's not abnormal to think your kid has cold sores. HSV1 is cold sores.\n\nAlso chicken pox are herpes. Do normal fathers not think their daughters could get chicken pox?", "Why do you have to refuse patients? Are you guys kissing them? As you wear gloves and a mask and sterilize equipment this is very odd", "Yeah, I\u2019m very concerned about that.\n\nI\u2019m immunosuppressed, so getting accurate info about something like this really matters.  Herpes might be a nuisance infection for most people, but it can cause a lot more injury to immunosuppressed people.  A friend of mine\u2019s father was pretty badly disfigured, and it can attack places like the eyes in immunosuppressed people.", "I think OP is making up shit about the doctor to back up the herpes denial. IDK why people get so twisted about the herpes virus considering 99% of the population has at least one form or another.", "Dad could've got herpes 40 years ago and it just flared up now.", "You seem to be hinting at cunnilingus, but you don't get oral herpes from someone with genital herpes.", "Because she says she hasn't have a sore since she was 8. So she **has** had a sore, meaning she has herpes. She doesn't have an active herpes outbreak now, but herpes is for life.", "They don\u2019t test directly for herpes.  They test for herpes antibodies, which is fairly reliable as long as it\u2019s not done too soon after the initial infection.", "[deleted]", "The herpes virus can travel facial nerves and cause encephalopathy too. Nasty, nasty virus.", "What?  No.  That\u2019s an exaggeration.  WHO estimates worldwide HSV1 at 67% of the world\u2019s population, with about 13% having HSV2.  They don\u2019t give any estimate of overlap, so if we\u2019re being extremely generous and assuming there is non, that only gets you 80%.  Estimates of HSV1 in the US are as low as 48% (ranges from 50-80%, but the CDC weighs in at 48%) about 12% having HSV2.  Again, assuming no overlap, that means as few as 60% of Americans have either type of herpes.", "Right? Shoot, dad could have been the one who originally gave it to OP. She said she had a cold sore at 8. So probably dad kissing her face or sharing food/drinks as a baby or toddler is what gave her the virus in the first place", "I hate to be all \"well actually...\" but you absolutely can get oral herpes from a genital herpes sore. The difference is literally only the location but both are either HSV-1 or HSV-2. It used to be that HSV-1 was oral herpes with mouth cold sores and HSV-2 was genital herpes with genital sores... But that's just not the case anymore. It's more likely that oral herpes is HSV-1 and genital herpes HSV-2, but a high percentage of genital cases are HSV-1 (from memory, up to 20-40, less likely that HSV-2 is oral, ranging between 6 to 15% of cases depending on study).", "Yes you absolutely do! Both strains of herpes can occur on either the mouth, genitals, or both. A genital infection can absolutely spread to the mouth or vice versa through oral sex.", "There\u2019s HSV1 and HSV2 herpes. Both can be on the mouth or the genitals and can pass from mouth to genitals and vice-versa. The main symptomatic difference between the two is one typically shows up as one sore while the other has typically has multiple sores.", "No. Actually I'm not hinting at anything. Although, HSV1 can cause genital herpes. But, I was not thinking about anything more than her dad needs to think about his recent contacts - because the virus would not live long on a water bottle. Its possible but much less likely. \n\nHSV2 is spread by sexual contact. \n\nI'm a nurse's kid and a physician's wife. I don't feel remotely coy about illness or STDs. \ud83d\ude0a", "Both HSV1 and HSV2 can infect all areas of your body.", "No we don\u2019t.

Scary.", "I'll second the recommendation for lysine - I've taken it when I've felt a cold sore coming on, but before it's broken out, and it's stopped it from developing. Works a charm, IMO.", "Yeah, cold sores can flare up when you're stressed or your immune system is working extra hard. That's why you get them when you're sick a lot.", "She says she had them as a child which means she still has the virus in her body.", "You can have the virus and never get flare-ups.", "Yeah - it\u2019s awful! \u2639\ufe0f", "Yes.
