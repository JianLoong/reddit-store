He may have had it for decades and be like the majority of people who don\u2019t experience regular outbreaks.", "Um, noooo.\n\nNTA, but dont let him kiss you on the lips when he has an active flare up. It will be even more awkward to explain to your friends, that your dad gave you herpes.", "I get fever blisters, cold sores, whatever. And I hate them. So, I don't play games and don't drink from other people's glasses, bottles, whatever. The virus has a really short life span, though. So, its me - not the glasses, bottles and jars. I am just likely hyper vigilant. \n\nAsk your dad where else his mouth has been because you have no active sores and obviously he did not get a mouth sore from you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nHowever, I don\u2019t think that you have a firm understanding of herpes, cold sores, etc. Even if you had a cold sore when you were 8, if that is in fact what it was, your father knew about it. Therefore, he should\u2019ve been more mindful. Frankly, he remembered that you had a cold sore when you were eight enough to latch onto the idea that you\u2019re the one that gave him herpes. \nAlso, a significant number of adults have Herpes Type 1, which causes cold sores. People don\u2019t exhibit symptoms very often, if at all. So it\u2019s not always as obvious that you are having an outbreak as it might seem. You could have a sore inside your mouth that you\u2019re not really noticing. It\u2019s possible that you were contagious at that moment in time, however, it\u2019s unlikely. \nGenital herpes is something else altogether. It is Herpes Type 2. It\u2019s a sexually transmitted disease. They can do testing to determine which type of herpes simplex type he has your post was a clear on that so I\u2019m not sure whether he just has a cold sore or he has \u201cdown there.\u201d It\u2019s a sexually transmitted disease. They can do testing to determine which type of herpes simplex type he has. Your post wasn\u2019t clear on that so I\u2019m not sure whether he just has a cold sore or he has herpes \u201cdown there.\u201d I don\u2019t know about everyone else but that\u2019s an important factoid that I would like clarification on. Because if he\u2019s claiming to have acquired a sexually transmitted disease through your drinking glass, then that\u2019s absurd. \nAt the end of the day, there is a possibility, if not a probability that you would\u2019ve transferred your cold sore to him at some point over your lifetime. It\u2019s extremely common. If he just developed a cold sore, that doesn\u2019t mean that he got it from your glass last week. He could\u2019ve gotten it from your glass 10 years ago and it\u2019s only manifesting now. So there are a lot of flaws in his logic. At the end of the day, Herpes Type 1 or cold sores are very common and a lot of people get them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for him to \u201cblame\u201d you. However, just like you may not have a firm bras on how all of the stuff works, he may not either. So I wouldn\u2019t be too upset with him because he\u2019s ignorant on the subject. Lots of people don\u2019t understand herpes and that\u2019s common too. Don\u2019t let your feelings about this situation with the girlfriend, color or interfere with how you see the possible (or not) transmission of herpes. You may be quick to blame the girlfriend based on some implied misgivings you have about their relationship. I recommend being aware of that possibility so that you are seeing all the details of the situation with clarity. \nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad. If you do have a history of a cold sore that doesn\u2019t really mean anything. You have nothing to feel bad about in this situation, as far as I can see.", "NTA. I think we all know how he got herpes.", "The doctor is wrong about not being able to get it from sharing drinks, and couldn't have possibly cleared OP unless they actually tested for HSV1 and 2, which I truly doubt they did.

It seemed like my relationship with mouth sores got much better when I stopped actively working in the early childhood wing of our school buildings.

Tell him he actually gave it to you.", "ESH especially your doctor. I would get a new one ASAP as your current MD is ignorant. Viral shedding can occur at any time. While it is highly more likely that your dad got herpes from someone with an qctive sore, it is not impossible for you to pass it on witbout a sore. And sharing drinks? Also possible. Get a better MD.", "NTA my niece gave me herpes and it\u2019s not a pleasant experience maybe he just wanted the reassurance that it came from his family/someone he trusted", "time for a new doctor", "YTA I got it from drinking from a cup before I ever kissed anyone.", "NTA - dumb is a polite thing to say to such a moron. I\u2019ve had cold sores for 40 years & my husband of 16 years has not contracted it, as if I have an actual sore (2-3 times a year) we are careful not to kiss or share drinks etc. I\u2019m worried a grown man has such limited understanding of the human body.

Maybe good to ask your dok if it is ok for your dad to share his cup with a toddler. I doubt he would want to sign his carreer off on that.\n\nI am the only one in my family who doesnt have it, and my sister and borther had it since they were young.

Do you kiss your mother with that tongue?", "If you had a cold sore when you were 8, then you actually do have herpes already.

Wouldn't she need to have been directly experiencing one for any contraction to occur? Let alone the fact they've managed for 19 years before dad was infected?

Their website says:\n\n\u201cHSV-1 is a version of the virus that causes cold sores or fever blisters. People may be exposed to HSV-1 as children due to close skin-to-skin contact with someone infected.\n\nA person with HSV-1 in tissues of the mouth can pass the virus to the genitals of a sexual partner during oral sex. The newly caught infection is a genital herpes infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cHSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither HSV-1 nor HSV-2 survives well at room temperature. So the virus is not likely to spread through surfaces, such as a faucet handle or a towel.
