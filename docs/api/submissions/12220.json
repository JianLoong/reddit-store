She\u2019s young but she needs to learn how to be discreet. In a workplace this behaviour wouldn\u2019t fly. NTA", "Well, if we're going to go banning every teenage girl who's ever had a crush on a middle-aged man, we're going to need a lot more empty houses.", "I agree. Trust your gut.", "So you'd let some little girl that's already saying those things about your partner in your house where they could try something and if it doesn't go their way they can claim assault? No thank you. nta", "I totally was thinking about American Beauty reading this lol\nAnd the movie with Drew Barrymore too... can't recall the name but sick mom,  teen daughter...", "There ya go", "I'm wondering how \"mature\" she looks.", "This just means you're also an asshole too, bro.", "They do when just the mere threat of impropriety from a teenage girl towards an adult husband could destroy his entire life.\n\nPerception is reality. **if this teenage girl feels jilted or vengeful, she could wreck his entire life in minutes.**", "I'd ban them to if they try something and it doesn't go their way they can easily claim SA", "So if the genders were reversed and the dad overheard a 16 yo boy constantly saying how hot his wife is and he'd totally fuck her if they got divorced he shouldn't have say on that person being in his house?", "Exactly, my dad's been called a DILF by my friends before. I shut it down and they're not allowed in my house anymore because it made me uncomfortable. Why did your daughter tell you? What did she think your reaction would be?", "Sure - just ask Mary Jo Buttafuoco about how innocent those schoolgirl crushes can be.", "Good!", "I was just thinking that in the event the husband ever says anything to her that she finds flattering, it could escalate, but yes you made me think that this girl might develop a general interest in older men and it will be really bad for her. NTA", "Yeah, I think a conversation needs to be had about it. Banning the girl right off is not helpful", "What kind of weird ass take is this? Just because she doesn\u2019t want someone who makes disrespectful comments about her husband in her home it doesn\u2019t mean she feels threatened by a 16yo. Calling \u201cdibs\u201d on a person is creepy at any age.", "This. All I could think about is what if this girl does something and he rejects her, she can put them in a dangerous situation. Also what 16 yr old says that shit or wants to hear that about a dad unless these are young parents.", "Exactly who would suffer if this girl didn\u2019t like rejection and made up lies. YTA lady", "Ahh so you think a family should let a 16 yo boy talk about how he wants to fuck the mom all the time.", "Is she? Her daughter was bothered enough by it to tell her.", "This is weird thing to randomly assume a 16 year old girl would do.", "It only takes one false allegation and this guy's life (and his wife's) is ruined.", "The poor adult man, being preyed upon by a teenage girl? Nah.\n\nOP needs to step up and be the adult here. And adults teach children when they're doing something inappropriate by sitting down and having a conversation with them about respectful behavior.", "jesus she could easy claim husband touched her or the wife did to get her out the way. And after what happened to that poor austrailian man who helped fix a car, i'm not being in same room as a women i don't 1000% trust without a camera", "\"Try something?!\" She is a high school girl with a crush, not a sexual predator. The way you think is disgusting.", "Yeah, seems fair.\nWhy do the genders have anything to do with it if the rest of the facts remain the same?", "Also, saying \"dibs\" isn't exactly the same as saying \"fuck [him]\". It's not far off and the implications are there but it's still not the same.", "If the genders are reversed, the right way to handle it is the same way as it is in this case. The adult should sit down with the child and gently explain what is and isn't an appropriate thing to say about someone.", "I didn't say it wasn't creepy, I said it was. But the friend is 16 and emotionally undeveloped, she either thinks she's being funny or has no idea of the consequences of what she's saying, so can't be judged on the same terms as like a 26 year old. The mom shouldn't have straight up banned her because now she's created conflict with her daughter. Instead, she should have helped her daughter to see why her friend's behaviour is creepy. I think that's a pretty sensible take.", "Yep. If OP has any concern that her husband would pursue an underage girl, all the more reason to ban her from the house (and consider seeking therapy/resources to exit the marriage, obv.) Either way, the friend is behaving inappropriately, and boundaries would protect everyone. This is a child. It\u2019s not a competition. If something happens, it\u2019s already too late.", "This happens all the time when the mum is attractive!", "Unless that child's going to force themselves on the mom and the mom has the sense to say no to a child, then yeah? Stacey's mom, she's got it going on", "\"She says her friend is just making jokes\" it doesn't sound like she told her mom in a bothered way more like a ha ha way.", "We can't know for sure but it reads like an ongoing inside joke between friends that OP's daughter thought OP might find funny because she's 16. If the daughter agreed it was uncomfortable or inappropriate then maybe.", "And their daughter\u2019s.", "You won't ever be in the same room as a woman you don't 1000% trust without a camera? Seriously? The internet is fuckin WILD. LOL.", "I'm not talking about sexual things with another persons child, that's how you end up with false allegations. This is extraordinarily terrible advice"]}
