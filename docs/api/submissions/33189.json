My mom kept her maiden name and her relationship with my dad was fine. \n\nI live in a jurisdiction where, by law, wives don't take their husband's last name and couples don't feel any less close and intimate. Tradition should not dictate the felt depth of the relationship or whatever it is the reason people give to *demand* that their spouses take on their name.", "NTA - there are so many valid reasons for not wanting to hyphenate/ change your last name. I got married in June and hyphenated mine and my husband kept just his. \n\nI think at the time where changing names was super important everyone got married, women changed their surnames and had children all with the same name. But, we don\u2019t live in these times anymore and so the whole same last name thing isn\u2019t as big of a deal. A marriage is more than sharing a last name because you are bonded by something much stronger. I think it\u2019s also something super important about being individuals as well as in a couple. There needs to be mutual respect and forcing someone to change a name  isn\u2019t - the name is not the be all end all.", "NTA OP.Hyphenated names can be a logistical nightmare.IF having the same name is the only way she can feel married then I think you two have bigger problems .", "NTA but have you considered merging your last names?

Online forms often won't accept it.\n\nI often end up making up an easier to understand version and going by that.", "NTA- but she's NTA either. The asshole is tradition, and the solution is simple. Get rid of both of your last names and pick a new one that you both like. It will require more paperwork Im sure, but it's worth it. Make something new together. When you have children you can also give them whatever last name you feel like. Break the cycle. Be your own person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, it's nice to be thoughtful and considerate of others' desires, but it's not wrong to follow our own hearts within the limits of the law. Sometimes we are placed in situations where we have to choose between following our heart or making someone special to us happy, but it should still be a choice that we make freely.

Personally I would feel the same as I would also want my children to have the same surname as both parents rather than having to pick one or the other. It also sounds like your traditional parents want to keep the family name alive which is an emotional reason. Whereas your only thoughts on it are practical. You need to decide whether your practical reasons are more important that your fianc\u00e9 or families emotional ones. Yes it\u2019s your life and your name and you can make the decision but starting a marriage off by disregarding your wife\u2019s emotions on something she feels strongly about doesn\u2019t seem like a great idea. You definitely need to have a longer conversation about it and try to acknowledge her feelings even if you ultimately don\u2019t agree with them and decide not to take/merge/hyphenate names", "Yep.

I do think it could be worth talking to your family and seeing what they think of the idea of a blended name rather than assuming how they will feel.", "And you won't be upset if you have daughters and no sons, right?", "I understand what you're saying, because I married into a very traditional family like yours and study such things and trust me, they're going to continue being a headache until you put your foot down, and the sooner you do that, the better for everyone.  The longer you cater to their sensibilities, the bigger the ultimate explosion will be and the more stress it will cause, especially if there are grandchildren in the frame.  For example, unless you are the one taking child/ren to the doctor, your wife will have to spell both her name and your, as you say, long and complicated name when making appointments, requesting records, checking in, and the same for everything at school etc. etc. etc., so the most logical thing and kind thing to do for her if you subtract \"tradition\" would be to give the child/ren her last name. So, will you follow logic, or will you saddle your wife with a lot of unnecessary annoyances because you are afraid of your parents?  Or is it less about them and more about your own sense of self and pride and privilege?  \n\nYou have my sympathies, because it's a very tricky situation to navigate.  I'm just saying that these are the foundation stones you are laying down for the rest of your life, with your chosen co-designer and co-builder of that life, and she with the one she has chosen to your great fortune.  If you let your parents determine how the stones are laid, then the foundation will not be trued to the strength and stability you could build with your partner as closely as if you more independently chose the materials and alignment of the stones and the material for the mortar, creating your own mix of what to keep from tradition and what not to keep from tradition.", "No I wouldn\u2019t, I\u2019d like daughters honestly."]}
