Usually people use that to mean \"I had no judgement and meant it perfectly innocently.\"\n\nBut obviously you *did* have judgement behind your question.

Mind your own business.\n\n*EDIT:  Follow-up based on OP's response:  In this case OP was using \"is she pregnant\" as an insult and a comment about overeating.   Yes, the guest might be AH for eating OP's cookies, or sister might be AH for giving \"his\" cookies to guest, but that is NOT the question he asked.*", "Oh honey, no. Absolutely, immediately not.\n\nYTA in every possible way, and it's actually really important for you to understand this now, while you're young enough to learn better. Take it from someone old enough to technically be your grandma.\n\nFirst of all, it is always, ALWAYS rude to ask if someone is pregnant, even if it seems INCREDIBLY obvious. Like, even if they are married and of normal childbearing age, and super skinny with a huge belly. I have seen that happen and the person turned out to have a massive abdominal tumour. Other times someone might be pregnant but carrying a baby with a severe disability who isn't going to live. If they aren't discussing what's going on with their body publicly, then it's not for you to know.\n\nSo number one, NEVER EVER ask if someone is pregnant. If they want you to know, they can tell you. Otherwise it's none of your business. Period. No matter how curious you are. It just isn't for you to know. Other people's medical and private information (which is what pregnancy is) IS NOT YOUR BUSINESS. Being curious doesn't give you a right to know people's personal business, and there are a million reasons for that. \n\nBut secondly, and more importantly, your entire premise was faulty to the point of being genuinely obnoxious and really seriously disgusting. Having a large belly and eating a lot of junk food ARE NOT SIGNS OF PREGNANCY. They are signs of being overweight, maybe of being stressed out, and possibly of disordered eating (only because you're talking about binge-eating entire packages of cookies, etc. in one sitting). \n\nLiterally none of what you described had anything to do with pregnancy, at least in the sense of being reliable INDICATORS of it, and you're old enough at 16 that I'm very concerned about how incredibly ignorant you are in thinking that they did (your understanding of pregnancy seems to come entirely from colloquial descriptions of \"cravings\" in pop culture), and also of the ignorance and intrusiveness of you thinking that it was okay to ask questions or have opinions about someone else's body or eating habits at all. Preschoolers can understand not to make comments or ask questions about people's bodies. It's rude. You don't get to have an answer to everything you're curious about.

You were legit curious because she showed  possible symptoms of pregnancy (even tho i wouldnt assume someone is pregnant because they eat a lot and have a rounder stomach. I have that too when im on my period). You didnt ask your sisters friend if she is pregnant, you asked your sister. Probably to not cross any lines, to not insult her, because you arent that close etc. I agree with the comments that you shouldnt ask someone if they are pregnant but you asked your sister. The friend wouldnt even know about your assumption if your sister wouldnt tell her so you didnt hurt her directly or in a mean spirited way. But also, she is young and if she would want you to know she is pregnant, you would know. Its not unusual that you want to keep it for yourself, especially when you are so young.

That sometimes people need kindness rather than judgment? \n\nI guess these are rhetorical questions, since your comment suggests you definitely don't understand that.", ">Even if they drank the last time you saw them, does not mean they want to drink every time.\n\nAlso (to add on for OP/comments, not to disagree with you), again, you don't know people's medical history. There's plenty of medications that have negative interactions with alcohol, many of which can have short term use. Several common antibiotics, for example, can have extreme negative side effects when mixed with alcohol. Someone might be on meds now and weren't previously. \n\nOr someone could have realized they had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and are not drinking as a result of that. Or gave up drinking to support someone else's recovery. \n\nOr they're the designated driver. Or just don't feel like drinking that day. \n\nAlways have non-alcoholic options.", "\"... all of *our* most unhealthy foods.\" She didn't bring them", "He clarifies in the comments that she helped herself", "Well it would be different if they were her snacks, but that\u2019s not clarified. Also boys can\u2019t get pregnant so this post wouldn\u2019t even exist then.", "Better to mind your own business and keep your nose where it belongs. Pregnant or not, unless he is her doctor or partner it's none of his concern.", "You're right and I apologise, heat of the moment :)", "Additionally, if a woman happens to miscarry after she\u2019s showing, she may continue to look pregnant for quite a while. And that just compounds her misery and grief.", "tbf \"girls that age\" makes sense considering hes 16 and shes 18 and thats a world of difference at that age", "Do I go around a workplace spreading rumors about a co-worker about a condition that women are still stigmatized for having? No. No I don\u2019t. I keep my mouth shut and wait for the person to mention it or announce it because women do not have enough rights for this to not be a potential problem.", "In your hypothetical, you absolutely \u201cwatch a coworker get bigger\u201d and do not comment on it because it\u2019s none of your damn business. \u201cLiving in society\u201d does not mean I owe you an explanation for why my body looks like it does. You just want an excuse to be rude.", "He says she came over and ate all this unhealthy food\u2026 no where does he say she ate all their snacks but i guess we have to villainize someone", "Yes but OP was being very vague about a few details plus if he was worried about her health (which is understandable) that would be different but he clearly has issues with this girl and is being very vague on purpose, like leaving out what sister ate during that time and just seems to have an issue with her overall presence (how dare someone hanging out with a friend chill on the couch!!)\u2026\n\nAlso look at how much teenagers can eat (especially teenage boys) or how a lot of people eat during hang outs and sleepovers\u2026 i actually highly doubt she was being a glutton or OP could be justified if he had said she ate all the food in their cupboard without permission or ate something he was looking forward to eating but he didn\u2019t specify that so im doubting a lot of his claims here", "YTA. I can understand how you came to the conclusion that she might be pregnant, but it's social norm to never ask a woman whether she is pregnant or not. \n\nEither she's fat because she's pregnant, or she's fat because she's just fat. Either way, you're calling them fat. \n\nThat being said, that person sounds like a lovely guest. I probably would've asked the same thing as a slight if someone was helping themselves to that much food without being offered, but it would be fair to call me AH.", "Yeah, that\u2019s a no for me. idc how rude it comes out to ask if someone\u2019s pregnant when they\u2019re actively raiding the pantry for food that they contributed $0 to- Im gonna need a reason why they feel entitled to all the food in *my* home when they\u2019re the guest.", "Ah yes, comparing eating disorders to intoxication-related crimes. DEFINITELY a great understanding going on here!", "Good point.  I agree.", "Nobody said a non resident has the same rights - true.  But what the commenter DID say was that \"its not his food.  He doesn't own the house.\"  This obviously indicates they think he has no rights.", "I mean, me personally if someone\u2019s in my house absolutely demolishing double stuffed Oreos like he described I\u2019d ask the same thing, not that being \u201clarger\u201d is a bad thing but like holy man, I don\u2019t even eat a whole pack of Oreos in like 3 days maximum much less 2 whole packs in 2-3 days", "SHE ATE THREE FUCKING POUNDS OF BROWNIES AND 2 FAMILY SIZE OREOS IN THREE DAYS.\n\nThat is the definition of gluttony.\n\nWhat the sister ate is immaterial. There is no \"issue with her presence\", it's just confusion regarding the obvious belly bump and the excessively gluttonous (*nobody* eats like that during pregnancy) eating. \n\n>Also look at how much teenagers can eat (especially teenage boys) or how a lot of people eat during hang outs and sleepovers\u2026\n\nI have never eaten a pound of brownies a day for 3 days straight, alongside 2 family size Oreo packages. That's *insanity*, and it sounds like she ate even more than that. That's like my 600 Pound Life level caloric intake. There's a very clear problem.", "What is different?", "How is asking about someone\u2019s personal medical condition behind their back, when he has no reason he *needs* to know the answer, NOT gossiping?\n\nThe key thing that makes it gossiping is that he had no need to know the answer\u2014he is asking about other people\u2019s personal business because he is curious and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s gossiping. (In general, I think \u201cgossiping\u201d gets a bad rap because it can be valuable to know what\u2019s going on in your community even if it\u2019s none of your business, but that doesn\u2019t make what OP is doing *not* gossiping.)\n\n If he had noticed a different pattern to his sister\u2019s friend\u2019s eating, and so asked his sister, \u201cIs she on Atkins?\u201d that would be obvious gossiping. If he was making snacks for them all and asked about her diet, that\u2019s not gossiping because he would need to know.", "I think youre to young to understand that \n\n\n1. Its not your body\n2.

That is the issue couples with the *gargantuan amount of slop she shoved in her face while doing it*. \n\nOP described her as visibly fat, so this is either pregnancy (not likely) or a common occurrence. \n\nStop. Justifying. Gluttony. Stop lionizing people with no self control. Stop making excuses for them."]}
