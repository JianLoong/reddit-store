Usually people use that to mean \"I had no judgement and meant it perfectly innocently.\"\n\nBut obviously you *did* have judgement behind your question.

Mind your own business.", "Oh honey, no. Absolutely, immediately not.\n\nYTA in every possible way, and it's actually really important for you to understand this now, while you're young enough to learn better. Take it from someone old enough to technically be your grandma.\n\nFirst of all, it is always, ALWAYS rude to ask if someone is pregnant, even if it seems INCREDIBLY obvious. Like, even if they are married and of normal childbearing age, and super skinny with a huge belly. I have seen that happen and the person turned out to have a massive abdominal tumour. Other times someone might be pregnant but carrying a baby with a severe disability who isn't going to live. If they aren't discussing what's going on with their body publicly, then it's not for you to know.\n\nSo number one, NEVER EVER ask if someone is pregnant. If they want you to know, they can tell you. Otherwise it's none of your business. Period. No matter how curious you are. It just isn't for you to know. Other people's medical and private information (which is what pregnancy is) IS NOT YOUR BUSINESS. Being curious doesn't give you a right to know people's personal business, and there are a million reasons for that. \n\nBut secondly, and more importantly, your entire premise was faulty to the point of being genuinely obnoxious and really seriously disgusting. Having a large belly and eating a lot of junk food ARE NOT SIGNS OF PREGNANCY. They are signs of being overweight, maybe of being stressed out, and possibly of disordered eating (only because you're talking about binge-eating entire packages of cookies, etc. in one sitting). \n\nLiterally none of what you described had anything to do with pregnancy, at least in the sense of being reliable INDICATORS of it, and you're old enough at 16 that I'm very concerned about how incredibly ignorant you are in thinking that they did (your understanding of pregnancy seems to come entirely from colloquial descriptions of \"cravings\" in pop culture), and also of the ignorance and intrusiveness of you thinking that it was okay to ask questions or have opinions about someone else's body or eating habits at all. Preschoolers can understand not to make comments or ask questions about people's bodies. It's rude. You don't get to have an answer to everything you're curious about.

You were legit curious because she showed  possible symptoms of pregnancy (even tho i wouldnt assume someone is pregnant because they eat a lot and have a rounder stomach. I have that too when im on my period). You didnt ask your sisters friend if she is pregnant, you asked your sister. Probably to not cross any lines, to not insult her, because you arent that close etc. I agree with the comments that you shouldnt ask someone if they are pregnant but you asked your sister. The friend wouldnt even know about your assumption if your sister wouldnt tell her so you didnt hurt her directly or in a mean spirited way. But also, she is young and if she would want you to know she is pregnant, you would know. Its not unusual that you want to keep it for yourself, especially when you are so young.
