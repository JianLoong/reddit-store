We wanted to make sure we stayed in contact since we do not hang out in person very much. We also try to get breakfast as a group occasionally, to make sure we stay in contact. \n\nSome background. I (28m) have been friends with \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d since middle school. We were best friends all through middle school and high school, had a standing \u201cThursday night sleepover\u201d for a couple years and continue to text in group chat and see each other occasionally. Since graduation(in 2014) B and I grew into a different life style. We want to further our education, build a career and family. Whereas A wanted to enjoy college party life and have fun while he could. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s important information for context. \n\nSo to why I might be the asshole. \n\nWhen I got married in 2018 both A and B were groomsmen in my wedding. We may have lived different life styles, but we are all friends still. They were a huge part of my life, and I wanted them to be a part of my wedding so I could cement them in my life as important to me, even if we don\u2019t hang out all the time. \n\nFlash forward to this year, we got our wedding invitations and neither B or I are going to be groomsmen in A\u2019s wedding. A is an only child and has very little family so I was expecting both B and i to be invited to be groomsmen. \n\nHowever, A chose 8 guys from his \u201cpartying\u201d friends group leaving both B and i off the list so I was extremely hurt by this. \n\nI do come on here a lot and any of the posts around weddings tend to lean towards \u201cit\u2019s their wedding, they can make the decisions they want\u201d and while I do not disagree with that, it does not make my feelings any less hurt. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to my wife and  therapist about it and they both suggest we send a gift to show support, but skip the wedding if it will negatively effect my mental health, which I think it would. \n\nB is somewhat hurt, but leans on the \u201cit\u2019s his wedding, his choice\u201d part of all this. \n\nI haven\u2019t talked to A about this, as I don\u2019t want to be the cause of problems during his planning. I figured the best thing for both of us is not go, send a gift and let him reach out to me for a reason instead of going to him to tell him. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA if I skip my \u201cfriends\u201d wedding?", "created_utc": 1692270713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tkdg3/aita_if_i_skip_my_friends_wedding_because_he_did/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it would affect your mental health, then that is understandable but still feels like you should still acknowledge his wedding at least or the relationship you currently have would become further strained. \nHowever, if you are still close, having a conversation would also be best.", "Do you really want to live your life with such a fragile and self centered ego?

Your post feels like you are pretty much stuck in the past, might not have made some great new friends and regret how you guys part ways.\nWhile your friend is able to live in the present, got some probably great friends with whom he spends lots of time and STILL sees you as friend he likes to invite to his wedding.", "YTA if you skip the wedding. You say you aren\u2019t that close anymore so NBD. Go and celebrate your friend\u2019s big day and go home. You get to go to the same party as everyone else.

While not TA to choose not to attend a wedding for any reason, But you are being petty. And you are oversharing your pettiness.  A polite \u201csorry, can\u2019t\u201d would have been fine.

Were you actually faced with a choice of who to make a groomsman? \n\nYou made a choice to have them there to create a new memory and a moment to bond you three together. That was YOUR motivation.\n\nHe is choosing the guys he actually spends his time with, and who share his same past times and activities. That is perfectly valid.\n\nYour feelings are hurt yes, and glad you have a therapist to work with. You used your marriage as a way to create new bonds with two old friends, which is sweet. He is creating those memories with the people he sees all the time, but you are still invited to share the day with him and have THOSE memories. \n\nPlus, it would be way harder to explain having 6/8 guys from his regular friends group and two others he sees only occasionally?", "YTA. \nYour groomsmen were your choice. \n\nHis groomsmen are his choice. \n\nYou said so yourself that you've drifted a part a bit, which is totally normal over time.  Unfortunately for you, because he still meant a lot to you, this isn't reciprocated anymore by your friend.  That's hard to learn for you I get that, but then having a toddler temper tantrum over it and refusing to go to the wedding?!?! Grow up!\n\nAnd waiting for him to reach out and explain why?! Ummm he owes you absolutely no explanation at all.  He chose who he wanted and he doesn't need to justify that to you. \n\nRunning off to your therapist claiming this will affect your mental health - oh my goodness the snowflake is strong within you - seriously, people change over time and he has. He's not done this out of malice or trying to ruin your mental health. You just need to be more mature. \n\nSorry but your relationship with each other isn't equal anymore but if you don't go to his wedding, I'd imagine there probably won't be much of a friendship there at all anymore and you'd have deserved it!", "YTA ya big baby", "Go ahead & skip the wedding.

For background, 5 of us have been friends since middle school (all M in our 40s).\n\nI was technically the 2nd to get married (one guy was in the military and married quietly). I had the other 4 in my wedding party. \n\nAll 5 of us have now been married, but mine was the only one where any of us were in the wedding. The last guy to get married did say he wished he'd had us up there, but he still went with family members instead. \n\nEach time, it hurt a little. Especially one who invited us all to the reception only. He had a small wedding, but it stung to see his 4 best friends left out. \n\nBut we're all still friends. We all understood that, as you said, it's their wedding and their decision. Yeah, it hurt but we all got passed it. \n\nThe question you need to answer (and your therapist and wife can help), is how you will feel if you miss this day in your friend's life. Is missing this a step in the relationship coming to an end?\n\nIf you can put the hurt aside to celebrate your friend, I would encourage you to go. \n\nYou WNBTA for skipping, but if you don't go, (a) send a great gift and make plans to celebrate them (dinner, drinks, whatever) after the honeymoon, (b) don't make a big deal about it, and (c) stay off social media for several days around it, or you'll see the pics and regret not even being there, regardless of your role in the wedding.", "I also have a lot of friends that I party with. I also go on vacations with them, and have dinners with them, and they care for me when I'm sick or heartbroken. \n\nSo I think you might be severely underestimating how close he is with his \"party friends\", and how deep their friendship goes. Especially if they all have had the same lifestyle for the past years, and are probably seeing each other much more than him and you. \n\nIf you don't want to go to his wedding unless you're the groomsman, it's up to you, so NAH, but fairly childish if you ask me.", "Send your apologies and best wishes along with flowers or whatever, and you don\u2019t have to go, of course not. \n\n(However, if friend B marries, what will you do if he doesn\u2019t ask you to play a major role? Will you also sit out that wedding?)\n\nBut then there\u2019s this:\n\n>\u201d\u2026let him reach out to me for a reason instead of going to him to tell him\u2026\u201d\n\nNo no no. You\u2019re asking for a squabble. You want your day in court. But this is immature. If you\u2019re not going to bring up your feelings before the wedding, then don\u2019t bring them up afterwards either:\n\n \u201cI\u2019m very sorry that we can\u2019t make it to celebrate your special day with you,  we have a prior,  we wish you a delightful wedding, many congratulations and all happiness\u201d, and that\u2019s that.

He got married a couple years ago and, to my surprise, I was not chosen as one of his groomsman. Like you, I was obviously hurt. I realized two things. One, as you are aware, it\u2019s his wedding. Two, just because he\u2019s my closest friend does not mean I am his. Once you get past the pride aspect of that realization, you recognize that there is nothing wrong with that.

You're right that it's his wedding and his right to choose who's in his wedding party, but it's completely valid that you feel hurt and want to skip the wedding. By sending a gift you're still sending a message that you care and support your friend. But before you do RSVP no, I urge you to really reflect on if you'll regret not attending the wedding.

You are not allowed to dictate or manipulate someone to get what you want.\n\nIf you don\u2019t go the friendship is over, he will cut you out because he will see a long time friend who couldn\u2019t be bothered to show up at the wedding.  \n\nYou do you, but understand the likely consequences.", "YTA, you could still be there and celebrate his day. To just not attend seems petty. You said yourself you went separate ways a bit", "If your friendship is at the level where you'd skip the wedding because you aren't a groomsman then you aren't really groomsman material for that person. This honor is reserved for the type of people that would be at your wedding regardless.", "Yta. \n\nMy husband has friends from childhood that he still communicates with.  He considers them friends. He cares about them and wants them in his life. But they aren\u2019t part of his everyday circle any more. When we invite people over, they aren\u2019t usually on the list.  Not because they aren\u2019t friends, but because the dynamic has changed. \n\nAnd although they were once close friends, when we got married they weren\u2019t groomsmen. Because he has other friendships that while newer, are more impactful on who he is as a person NOW, and where he is in his life.  But we still invited all of those friends, because he wanted them to be apart of his joy.  \n\nIf you were a groomsman, would you have fun? You\u2019d be expected to attend more events, and hang out with people you don\u2019t know well.  Or you could go to the wedding, acknowledge the place you held for many years in his life, the place you still hold, and then go home at the end of a really fun night, knowing you didn\u2019t have to do any of the pony show that being a groomsman entails. \n\nIf it\u2019s more about being around all those people from hs, and your mental health, I think you can call him, speak candidly about that. \u201cHey A, I\u2019m so happy for you and W, and am thrilled you\u2019re getting married to someone you love so much. I really wish I could be there, but I\u2019m struggling with my mental health right now, and i think maybe it\u2019s best for the healing I\u2019m doing if I don\u2019t go to your wedding.  But I would love to host a thing for you when you come home, so we can toast together.\u201d \n\nBut if it\u2019s just being hurt that you\u2019re not a groomsman, and in your mind \u201cnot as important\u201d anymore, then you need to get over that.  And given that you make a point to point out that these are his \u2018party friends\u2019 and that you prioritized a job while he had fun, it sounds like you\u2019re judging him pretty hard for not choosing the same path as you.", "You are still friends. I get why you are hurt but to avoid his wedding altogether just feels petty. You have to appreciate your view of your friendship might not be his view and given his social activities he probably has a lot of friends whilst you might not. I think you are being a little selfish to let your feeling affect you so much that you don\u2019t go at all.", "YWBTA\n\nFirst, when you characterize A as having gone down a different path you are being judgemental. You are saying that he has gone down a destructive path of partying which may be true but I find it just as plausible that he simply has a more robust social life that is perfectly healthy. He went to school, is pursuing career goals, and is marrying the love of his life at 28. That hardly sounds like he has been derailed by poor choices and a life lived in the fast lane. \n\n\nSecond, when you were laser focused on your studies and girlfriend, now wife, he was building new social bonds.

They may all know each other already, thus sparing you being 'the odd man out in the wedding party.'  They may live closer.  They may know his future wife much better.

If the other guy gets upset, which I highly doubt he will, just let him know you support his marriage and understand your friendship isn't what it was. No harm/no foul.", "YTA: You all grew a bit apart, no big deal you guys are still friends just less close. Your friend made other close friends during his time at college, I wouldn't dismiss his friends simply because they are \"party friends\"", "Sounds like he\u2019s more interested in the \u201cparty\u201d part of wedding party. Think about the bachelor party and how crazy that will most likely get with this group. Is that really something you want to subject yourself to? If you want to keep the friendship, go to the wedding and be happy for your friend. It\u2019s not a slight against you, you\u2019ll honestly probably both be happier with this arrangement.", "YTA for making this about you. It isn\u2018t. You\u2018re not the Main Character.", "YTA you\u2019ve known A for years but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re involved in his day to day life in a meaningful way. He choose people who he is currently closer to than you. You may not respect his choice in his \u201cpartying friends\u201d but that is a your problem. Get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t live anywhere near each other and he picked EIGHT party bros?\n\nDude it\u2019s gonna be party central, big Bachelor party, etc.  It\u2019s the vibe, which you aren\u2019t apart of.\n\nIt\u2019s a reflection of the different life styles you lead and admitted to.  You view these events totally different", "Why are you making his wedding about you? He has other friends. He chose them. You have fewer friends. You chose him. If you can\u2019t attend and genuinely show support and be happy for him, it\u2019s best you send your regrets.", "If you were still best friends and did everything together NOW, then that makes sense.\n\nImagine if you asked an old friend from before middle school to go to your wedding, and they got angry at you for not making them your best man, how would you feel?\n\nYou'd think they're acting silly, since you changed.\n\nGo to the wedding. You might be able to have some nice laughs about old nostalgic jokes you guys used to make. Snile about the old times.\n\nBut that's all they are. The good old days. You don't wed to the good old days. You wed to your present and future\n\nSo YTA, for assuming he should view you as the most important person in his life forever and always, regardless of what he and you are doing in your lives.", "NAH\n\nI don't agree with your reasoning. Does not seem like you are close anymore, just old high school friends. Seems like the \"party friends\" are his real current friend group, makes sense.", "YTA, honestly I don\u2019t think being part of a wedding party is that important.", "NAH.\n\nA wedding invite is an invitation, not a summons.", "YTA.  Obviously you do need to protect your mental health, but going into such a spiral because you weren\u2019t chosen as a groomsman is a bit much.  You need to pair up with the girl on r/amiwrong that wants to skip her SIL wedding because she\u2019s not a bridesmaid.", "NAH- An invitation is not an obligation. You can skip a wedding for any reason", "YTA, I\u2019m sure it was hard for A to decide and those other 8 guys might be in a whole group that he couldn\u2019t exclude (it was all or none). You might\u2019ve been on the wait list in his head.  But your friends have other friends. It\u2019s just the way it goes. \n\nI have been a bridesmaid in a few weddings of high school friends that stayed in our home town.  But Ive moved a few times and made more friends in different cities through work and university. If I think of my best friends I would ask to be in my wedding party, only one bride of 3 would make the list.  \n\nTbh, it\u2019s why I think I\u2019d go the no bridesmaid route. One of my closest friends didn\u2019t have bridesmaids because she would\u2019ve chosen her university friends and her highschool friends would\u2019ve been really hurt. So she only have her sister.", "Seriously. I know we love to talk about mental health and all in 2023 but holy mother of Christ.

If this was a major setback for me I would consider myself winning.\n\nI\u2019d be ecstatic, being a best man/groomsman actually sucks. You might have to make a speech, you have to rent a matching tux, you have to spend money on a stupid bachelor party\u2026 and you still buy a wedding gift. This way you get out Scott free. You get to go to the wedding, get drunk, dance (if that\u2019s your cup of tea) and then go home after and not worry about ruining the stupid tux you rented.", "I don\u2019t love this take. If the thought of attending at this point isn\u2019t what OP wants, I don\u2019t think not attending makes him TAH. In the same vein, an invitation is not a summons. OP can send a gift and well wishes but I don\u2019t love saying he\u2019s TAH for not attending\n\nETA: OP is definitely TAH for being so spun up about not being asked to be a groomsman.", "Then you mean NAH.

I get it\u2019s his wedding, their decision to make and I don\u2019t expect an explanation for their decision. \n\nThat does not make the decision any less painful for me, though. \n\nI agree with the situations you laid out, but I\u2019ve made it sound like I haven\u2019t come to terms with possibly ending the friendship. So I\u2019m situation 1, I just let the friendship go rather than getting more mad. I understand that might happen, but at the end of the day the \u201cright\u201d decision for the long run doesn\u2019t always feel \u201cright\u201d in the moment. \n\nThank you, for the feedback!", "Same asshole who tried to shame an OP for not wanting someone he barely knows at his bachelor party.", "I\u2019m 99% sure that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do, but I wanted an unbiased internet opinion. \n\nThank you!", "It\u2019s less we went separate ways and more we had different priorities which is why we never physically hang out. We talk almost daily. \n\nPlus, something I didn\u2019t add in the post is 1 or 2 of the groomsmen hang out with him less than we do, for the same reason.", "\ud83e\udd2f, How old are you?", "That\u2019s when we graduated. I consistently visited him and partied with him for his first couple years of college. I found a wife, settled down and didn\u2019t want to party any more, so we stopped hanging out as much, but talk almost daily.", "Do you only go to weddings if you're in the wedding party?", "He's an AH because he's so self-involved that he's talking about his \"mental health suffering\" over not being chosen to be part of the wedding party. He's making something deeply personal that likely isn't a personal slight at all.\n\nA may (and probably does) value his friendship very much . . . as a lifelong friend whom he is in touch with regularly, and cares about deeply, but who isn't a part of his day-to-day life anymore as an adult. He chose groomsmen who are. And the fact that OP dismisses them as \"his party friends\" rather than \"the people he actually socialises with regularly\" speaks volumes. It's petty and childish, and reeks of something that may not be jealousy but isn't far off. \n\nWhen a lifelong friend whom you care about deeply invites you to their wedding, a good person understands that THAT is an acknowledgement of the friendship, they don't look at the invitation and go, \"Is that all? I was expecting to be part of the bridal party.\" And they certainly don't passive-aggressively threaten not to attend at all because they didn't get a figurative sash saying, \"Very Best Friend\".", "I agree with you in part, that an invitation is not a summons. People miss weddings all the time. But my point is that if OP skips the wedding just because they weren\u2019t included in the wedding party when they think they should be it that\u2019s pretty petty. And they would be TAH for missing the wedding for that reason.", "I would encourage you not to think so 'all or nothing' about friendships.  From my perspective, this guy puts in effort to talk on a group chat regularly with you and meet up with you for breakfast, despite the fact that you lead very different lives and haven't had a convenient reason to interact (i.e. going to the same school) in years.  He clearly is a friend.  I'm older than you, but the number of people who were childhood friends who I put this amount of effort into... it's one person, my best friend from childhood.  We interact similarly now... we keep in touch online, we meet up for dinner every few months or so to catch up.  Our lives went in vastly different directions and she is no longer my closest friend or the person I am the most honest and open with about my life or the person I would turn to in a time of need, and I'm not hers either.  But we still value each other, we still put in the effort to stay in touch, and we are absolutely friends, even if the intensity of that friendship has changed over time.", "Man, ignore 75% of the comments in this thread. You are handling this so maturely. You know the feelings you have are more intense than you'd like them to be, but you're talking to your therapist and your wife about them instead of taking it out on anyone else. You're worried about being inconsiderate and taking steps to mitigate that while also being aware of your own ability to tolerate the uncomfortable situation. \n\nHere's my advice: if you've got the time between now and the wedding, go ahead and grieve that the relationship isn't the same as it once was. Give those feelings the time and space they deserve, because relationships do have seasons sometimes, and change can be painful. Once you've given yourself the space to grieve this change and process it, you might feel better about going and celebrating your friend in the current configuration of your relationship. Or you might not, and that's okay, too. The key thing to avoid, which you're doing, is lashing out at anyone else. \n\nI have a lot more thoughts on this as someone who has been married twice, once young and once in a much healthier place in life, and (given your comment on ADHD) I have thoughts from a neurodivergent standpoint as well. If you want to shoot the shit about it, send me a DM. \n\nBut honestly, ignore most of the comments here. You're being mature in a way a lot of people aren't healed or healthy enough to understand. Process your grief, and see how you feel afterwards. The friendship has changed but it's not dead. You'll figure it out.", "You're NTA, but I do think you can have a chat with your friend, or this is gonna eat you up inside, straighten it out, not in an accusatory way, but be forthcoming on how hurt you feel about said decision, and perhaps you'll get more clarity on why he picked those other guys and not you and B!!\n\nAnd if you don't feel comfortable being somewhat vulnerable like that, maybe it is indeed time to rethink this friendship!!", "There is no such thing as unbiased folks on Reddit.", "Speak to him! No harm in that!", "Who cares? He clearly feels closer with them than he does with you. That's fine. You made a conscious and intentional choice to deprioritize hanging out with him. He is likely aware of this. \n\nI'm in daily group texts with a lot of people, and I wouldn't expect that to be much of a factor in bridal party decisions.", "That\u2019s fair, but you described the diff in \u201clifestyle\u201d started nearly a decade ago. Can you really blame your friend for developing a closer friend group that he actually sees in his daily life then the buddy he messages online? Soft YTA imo", "Eh it\u2019s hard to say. This all could be true but I had a phase like A. De-prioritized older but deeper, closer friends for new fun partying friends.\n\nThen a few years later when I matured and realized how much I appreciated the depth of past friendships, I wanted to re-form connection with my old friends. Unfortunately bud understandably they were particularly eager to get close again, as they had made their own deep friends and likely held some negative feelings over me leaving for \u201cflashy fun new friends\u201d.", "That\u2019s a fair point. I can dig it.", "He won't regret it cause he's hurt about not being a groomsman!!

I'm still friends with people I grew up with, in the same way that OP is.  We keep in touch online, we get together for dinner once every couple months or so to catch up.  I've known them my whole life, I'll always love them.  But the friends I can rely on in my daily life, the friends I am emotionally vulnerable with now, are all people I met as an adult.  Longevity doesn't necessarily equal depth when it comes to friendship.  A might have really meaningful relationships with the friends he met partying in college.  My old bestie is someone I love who I had a lot in common with as a kid but our lives are VERY different and we haven't grown the same way.  The friends I made as an adult are people who I love who I have a lot in common with NOW and who have grown in the same direction as me since we met as younger adults.", "Deeper friends? OP has no space for friends in his life if group messaging and a few breakfasts a year is how he maintains his closest friendships. That is very much a superficial connection based on middle school nostalgia rather than what they share as adults.", "Info:  do you have adhdv or anything like that?", "Honestly it looks like you have you're mind made up no matter what feedback you get here.  You're feelings are hurt - that's understandable. Regardless of who's a close friend in who's eyes - Skipping a friends wedding for the reasons you plan to skip it is a mistake in my mind.  I'd assume that no matter how much you feel like it's the right decision  for you right now, you'll likely regret it later down the road.", "idk, it's kind of wild to be like, well I can only be happy enough for my friend to go to his wedding if he makes me a groomsman. Otherwise I won't be happy enough for my friend to go.", ">My conversation with my therapist would have been \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard to be there, but I\u2019m so happy for my friend and being in his wedding, that it\u2019s worth putting up with it\u201d \n\nSo being happy for your friend and sharing the day with both him and B is not worth putting up with it...\n\nYou realise that says a lot more about how much you value your friendship than it does about A and him not making you groomsman?", "Yeah everyone\u2019s different! In my experience the college partying friends don\u2019t end up being deep meaningful connections but I guess it could be! \n\nI think the difference is if they\u2019re friends because you both enjoy partying they\u2019re not likely to be deep friends.", "Some people are like that- they hold history in high value despite the business of adult life. \n\nI personally feel that your close childhood friends will know you better than almost anyone you meet as an adult-it\u2019s like your parents. They know you at your root.", "I am in the process of being tested for adhd. Likely that I do, yes.", "I am 99% made up in my mind, yes. I do appreciate the feedback though.

The wheels came off the bus when my spouse had an affair with one of my closest friends (from childhood.) I found myself single for the first time in a long time in my late 20s. I was also fairly estranged from my core friend group given the circumstances of the affair. This is when I really found myself.I was able to rediscover my old passions and create new ones. In doing so, I met new people and formed lifetime friendships based on common interests, shared passions, and compatible personalities rather than the arbitrary lines of a school district and the randomness of classroom seating charts. These friends are my chosen family. We understand and appreciate each other based on who we are as fully realized adults without the baggage of childhood perceptions and expectations. Though some may view it as a form of arrested development I never settled into a stagnant sort of adulthood. I continue to learn, grow, and seek out new and enriching experiences and continue to make friends along the way.", "The way neurodivergent folks view friendship/closeness can be very different from how neurotypical see it.
