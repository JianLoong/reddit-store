We wanted to make sure we stayed in contact since we do not hang out in person very much. We also try to get breakfast as a group occasionally, to make sure we stay in contact. \n\nSome background. I (28m) have been friends with \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d since middle school. We were best friends all through middle school and high school, had a standing \u201cThursday night sleepover\u201d for a couple years and continue to text in group chat and see each other occasionally. Since graduation(in 2014) B and I grew into a different life style. We want to further our education, build a career and family. Whereas A wanted to enjoy college party life and have fun while he could. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s important information for context. \n\nSo to why I might be the asshole. \n\nWhen I got married in 2018 both A and B were groomsmen in my wedding. We may have lived different life styles, but we are all friends still. They were a huge part of my life, and I wanted them to be a part of my wedding so I could cement them in my life as important to me, even if we don\u2019t hang out all the time. \n\nFlash forward to this year, we got our wedding invitations and neither B or I are going to be groomsmen in A\u2019s wedding. A is an only child and has very little family so I was expecting both B and i to be invited to be groomsmen. \n\nHowever, A chose 8 guys from his \u201cpartying\u201d friends group leaving both B and i off the list so I was extremely hurt by this. \n\nI do come on here a lot and any of the posts around weddings tend to lean towards \u201cit\u2019s their wedding, they can make the decisions they want\u201d and while I do not disagree with that, it does not make my feelings any less hurt. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to my wife and  therapist about it and they both suggest we send a gift to show support, but skip the wedding if it will negatively effect my mental health, which I think it would. \n\nB is somewhat hurt, but leans on the \u201cit\u2019s his wedding, his choice\u201d part of all this. \n\nI haven\u2019t talked to A about this, as I don\u2019t want to be the cause of problems during his planning. I figured the best thing for both of us is not go, send a gift and let him reach out to me for a reason instead of going to him to tell him. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA if I skip my \u201cfriends\u201d wedding?", "created_utc": 1692270713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tkdg3/aita_if_i_skip_my_friends_wedding_because_he_did/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it would affect your mental health, then that is understandable but still feels like you should still acknowledge his wedding at least or the relationship you currently have would become further strained. \nHowever, if you are still close, having a conversation would also be best.", "Do you really want to live your life with such a fragile and self centered ego?

Your post feels like you are pretty much stuck in the past, might not have made some great new friends and regret how you guys part ways.\nWhile your friend is able to live in the present, got some probably great friends with whom he spends lots of time and STILL sees you as friend he likes to invite to his wedding.", "YTA if you skip the wedding. You say you aren\u2019t that close anymore so NBD. Go and celebrate your friend\u2019s big day and go home. You get to go to the same party as everyone else.

Were you actually faced with a choice of who to make a groomsman? \n\nYou made a choice to have them there to create a new memory and a moment to bond you three together. That was YOUR motivation.\n\nHe is choosing the guys he actually spends his time with, and who share his same past times and activities. That is perfectly valid.\n\nYour feelings are hurt yes, and glad you have a therapist to work with. You used your marriage as a way to create new bonds with two old friends, which is sweet. He is creating those memories with the people he sees all the time, but you are still invited to share the day with him and have THOSE memories. \n\nPlus, it would be way harder to explain having 6/8 guys from his regular friends group and two others he sees only occasionally?", "YTA. \nYour groomsmen were your choice. \n\nHis groomsmen are his choice. \n\nYou said so yourself that you've drifted a part a bit, which is totally normal over time.  Unfortunately for you, because he still meant a lot to you, this isn't reciprocated anymore by your friend.  That's hard to learn for you I get that, but then having a toddler temper tantrum over it and refusing to go to the wedding?!?! Grow up!\n\nAnd waiting for him to reach out and explain why?! Ummm he owes you absolutely no explanation at all.  He chose who he wanted and he doesn't need to justify that to you. \n\nRunning off to your therapist claiming this will affect your mental health - oh my goodness the snowflake is strong within you - seriously, people change over time and he has. He's not done this out of malice or trying to ruin your mental health. You just need to be more mature. \n\nSorry but your relationship with each other isn't equal anymore but if you don't go to his wedding, I'd imagine there probably won't be much of a friendship there at all anymore and you'd have deserved it!", "YTA ya big baby", "Go ahead & skip the wedding.

For background, 5 of us have been friends since middle school (all M in our 40s).\n\nI was technically the 2nd to get married (one guy was in the military and married quietly). I had the other 4 in my wedding party. \n\nAll 5 of us have now been married, but mine was the only one where any of us were in the wedding. The last guy to get married did say he wished he'd had us up there, but he still went with family members instead. \n\nEach time, it hurt a little. Especially one who invited us all to the reception only. He had a small wedding, but it stung to see his 4 best friends left out. \n\nBut we're all still friends. We all understood that, as you said, it's their wedding and their decision. Yeah, it hurt but we all got passed it. \n\nThe question you need to answer (and your therapist and wife can help), is how you will feel if you miss this day in your friend's life. Is missing this a step in the relationship coming to an end?\n\nIf you can put the hurt aside to celebrate your friend, I would encourage you to go. \n\nYou WNBTA for skipping, but if you don't go, (a) send a great gift and make plans to celebrate them (dinner, drinks, whatever) after the honeymoon, (b) don't make a big deal about it, and (c) stay off social media for several days around it, or you'll see the pics and regret not even being there, regardless of your role in the wedding.", "I also have a lot of friends that I party with. I also go on vacations with them, and have dinners with them, and they care for me when I'm sick or heartbroken. \n\nSo I think you might be severely underestimating how close he is with his \"party friends\", and how deep their friendship goes. Especially if they all have had the same lifestyle for the past years, and are probably seeing each other much more than him and you. \n\nIf you don't want to go to his wedding unless you're the groomsman, it's up to you, so NAH, but fairly childish if you ask me.", "Send your apologies and best wishes along with flowers or whatever, and you don\u2019t have to go, of course not. \n\n(However, if friend B marries, what will you do if he doesn\u2019t ask you to play a major role? Will you also sit out that wedding?)\n\nBut then there\u2019s this:\n\n>\u201d\u2026let him reach out to me for a reason instead of going to him to tell him\u2026\u201d\n\nNo no no. You\u2019re asking for a squabble. You want your day in court. But this is immature. If you\u2019re not going to bring up your feelings before the wedding, then don\u2019t bring them up afterwards either:\n\n \u201cI\u2019m very sorry that we can\u2019t make it to celebrate your special day with you,  we have a prior,  we wish you a delightful wedding, many congratulations and all happiness\u201d, and that\u2019s that.

He got married a couple years ago and, to my surprise, I was not chosen as one of his groomsman. Like you, I was obviously hurt. I realized two things. One, as you are aware, it\u2019s his wedding. Two, just because he\u2019s my closest friend does not mean I am his. Once you get past the pride aspect of that realization, you recognize that there is nothing wrong with that.

You're right that it's his wedding and his right to choose who's in his wedding party, but it's completely valid that you feel hurt and want to skip the wedding. By sending a gift you're still sending a message that you care and support your friend. But before you do RSVP no, I urge you to really reflect on if you'll regret not attending the wedding.

You are not allowed to dictate or manipulate someone to get what you want.\n\nIf you don\u2019t go the friendship is over, he will cut you out because he will see a long time friend who couldn\u2019t be bothered to show up at the wedding.  \n\nYou do you, but understand the likely consequences.", "YTA, you could still be there and celebrate his day. To just not attend seems petty. You said yourself you went separate ways a bit", "If your friendship is at the level where you'd skip the wedding because you aren't a groomsman then you aren't really groomsman material for that person. This honor is reserved for the type of people that would be at your wedding regardless.", "Yta. \n\nMy husband has friends from childhood that he still communicates with.  He considers them friends. He cares about them and wants them in his life. But they aren\u2019t part of his everyday circle any more. When we invite people over, they aren\u2019t usually on the list.  Not because they aren\u2019t friends, but because the dynamic has changed. \n\nAnd although they were once close friends, when we got married they weren\u2019t groomsmen. Because he has other friendships that while newer, are more impactful on who he is as a person NOW, and where he is in his life.  But we still invited all of those friends, because he wanted them to be apart of his joy.  \n\nIf you were a groomsman, would you have fun? You\u2019d be expected to attend more events, and hang out with people you don\u2019t know well.  Or you could go to the wedding, acknowledge the place you held for many years in his life, the place you still hold, and then go home at the end of a really fun night, knowing you didn\u2019t have to do any of the pony show that being a groomsman entails. \n\nIf it\u2019s more about being around all those people from hs, and your mental health, I think you can call him, speak candidly about that. \u201cHey A, I\u2019m so happy for you and W, and am thrilled you\u2019re getting married to someone you love so much. I really wish I could be there, but I\u2019m struggling with my mental health right now, and i think maybe it\u2019s best for the healing I\u2019m doing if I don\u2019t go to your wedding.  But I would love to host a thing for you when you come home, so we can toast together.\u201d \n\nBut if it\u2019s just being hurt that you\u2019re not a groomsman, and in your mind \u201cnot as important\u201d anymore, then you need to get over that.  And given that you make a point to point out that these are his \u2018party friends\u2019 and that you prioritized a job while he had fun, it sounds like you\u2019re judging him pretty hard for not choosing the same path as you.", "You are still friends. I get why you are hurt but to avoid his wedding altogether just feels petty. You have to appreciate your view of your friendship might not be his view and given his social activities he probably has a lot of friends whilst you might not. I think you are being a little selfish to let your feeling affect you so much that you don\u2019t go at all.", "YWBTA\n\nFirst, when you characterize A as having gone down a different path you are being judgemental. You are saying that he has gone down a destructive path of partying which may be true but I find it just as plausible that he simply has a more robust social life that is perfectly healthy. He went to school, is pursuing career goals, and is marrying the love of his life at 28. That hardly sounds like he has been derailed by poor choices and a life lived in the fast lane. \n\n\nSecond, when you were laser focused on your studies and girlfriend, now wife, he was building new social bonds. They formed memories and shared experiences as adults. Their connections aren't based on middle school sleepovers fifteen years ago. These groomsmen are his everyday adult friends. They interact regularly face to face rather than through a group chat. They are sharing more than the very occasional plate of pancakes. These friends aren't necessarily new. He has likely spent a lot of time with these people during the last 5-10 years. \n\nWhile you were prioritizing your goals and your relationship your connection with this person waned. He wasn't a priority and he has other people in his life who has filled the void. Stop being petty. Go out and celebrate your friend's wedding.", "YTA. If your mental health can't handle that people grow apart you're going to need a lot of therapy for dealing with a lot of things.\n\nGeez you could just go, have some fun maybe plan to get together soon to maybe get close again or not and go on with your life.", "YTA - Why can't you be happy for him, period.  Why must it be tit for tat with you?  Grow up.", "YTA for the simple reason of it\u2019s their wedding. No one gets a say in how any wedding goes except the people getting married. Period end of discussion.", "NTA. If going to the wedding will hurt your mental health then don\u2019t go.", "YTA\n\nYour extrovert friend selected his groomsmen from his close friends - the ones he spends a majority of time with and communicates with a lot more.", "YTA are you a little girl? Who cares if you are a groomsman. You got an invite, grow up.", "YTA. Just go to the wedding, do you really want to be included in a group of partiers? Let them get wasted and act like 15 year olds and spend your time with B and your wife.", "Yea YTA. Entitled at that to.", "YTA because you expected to be a groomsman and not wanting to attend for this reason is petty. I have many friends of which i was extremely close with and hung out with almost every single day for 3 years straight. but that was 10+ years ago. Some of them got married, I wasnt invited to some, and it did not even hurt my feelings or bothered me. its their life and their choice. its called being an adult - I am so happy for them. we all went our separate ways but we all each cherish our old memories together and still support each other from far away.", "YTA.  Grow up.  This isn\u2019t about you.   It\u2019s a lot more fun to be just a guest anyway.", "Wait, you're upset he chose the friends who actually hang out with him regularly over the friends who \"went their separate ways\" to focus on their career? YTA. Get over yourself.", "NTA.  His wedding/his choice and your choice as a gues.", "NAH\n\nHe has the right to pick his own groomsmen, and to feel differently about your friendship than you do.\n\nYou have the right to be upset about that and skip the wedding. You also have the right to decide whether or not to tell him the true reason.\n\nThat said, my opinion is that you should definitely be honest about why you're not going. Don't put any blame on him, but let him know you feel disappointed because you care about him, and would hate to see your friendship fade. And then just wait and see how he responds. He might be completely unaware of any of it, or perhaps has a completely valid explanation for it all.", "I would add that it's understandable that A would like to have his party friends representing. They are his here and now. People have different expectations on friendships, doesn't make them bad friends, just good acquaintances. His view is clearly more shallow than yours and this is a byproduct of that.", "So they are the AH because they aren't that close and shouldn't expect anything but should still be expected to go to the wedding? That doesn't add up.", "he doesn't see how entitled he truly is.", "What you are missing in not being part of the Party is going to be a lot of **Partying**. Would you really feel comfortable and have fun at those events? Based on your description of those people it's likely to be pretty hard core. I don't think you or A would have really enjoyed all of that. As friends you have gone different ways based on who you are. He invited you because he still values your friendship and history.", "You make very valid points. It is something to think about. Thank you, for the feedback!", "You misunderstand my last point. I don\u2019t expect, or need a reason from him. It\u2019s his choice. I also mentioned that in my post. He can make the decision he wants to. It\u2019s his wedding. Doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be hurt though. \n\nWhat I meant by that, is if he wanted a reasoning from ME, I would let him reach out and request it, to not cause drama. I\u2019m not trying to make it about ME, but making him justify why I wasn\u2019t chosen is making it about me. RSVP no, then sending a gift seemed like the least drama option. \n\nIf he wants ti know why I didn\u2019t come, he can ask. \n\nAlso, you have no idea what I\u2019m going through or what I\u2019ve gone through. So, the \u201crunning to your therapist, snowflake\u201d comment is unnecessary. All I was trying to do is give context to the situation. Not sure calling me a snowflake was necessary. I\u2019ve been banned once for not being \u201ccivil\u201d, so I will leave out the response I really wanted to give.", "Imagine wanting to be a part of a wedding you had to force yourself into by saying \"either put me in the wedding or I'm not coming\" lmao, that's even more sad than the situation in OP.", "Can confirm- I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid 7x and it is noooot that fun or magical and costs a lot of fucking money.  \n\nI\u2019m in my early 30s now and most of my friends are married with families and for that, I am GLAD. Never wanna partake in that shit ever again.", "I greatly appreciate this comment. Thank you, so much. \n\nI would have to assume it would be a step towards it coming to an end, but idk. \n\nI don\u2019t want to lose a \u201cfriend\u201d, but I keep thinking about it; are we even friends? Or are we holding on to the nostalgia of a perceived friendship? \n\nI still care about him and I appreciate the friendship especially when we were in middle and high school but the energy and effort it\u2019s going to take to go to the wedding, mask and be happy just feels like it\u2019ll be too much for me. \n\nIdk. I will for sure be bringing this comment up in therapy in a few weeks\ud83d\ude02. Thank you, so much.", "I think that\u2019s a fair point. Thank you, for the feedback!", "Not necessarily holding a grudge. It\u2019s his decision. I can accept that, but it doesn\u2019t make me feel any less hurt. \n\nWe\u2019re still talking almost daily, I don\u2019t want to end the friendship, but I don\u2019t really want to go to the wedding either.", "We communicate daily in a group chat. A few years ago, I didn\u2019t want us to grow apart so I specially started the group chat and I\u2019m active in it, to make sure we\u2019re always at least talking still even if we enjoy different things. \n\nWe went out to breakfast last year as a group of 3, and it was a great time.", "Very thoughtful and insightful response. Thank you. \n\nI don\u2019t care that I\u2019m not number 1, but I thought I\u2019d be in his top 8 lol. \n\nPoint 2 hit home. Thank you.", "I may have implied we don\u2019t \u201ctalk\u201d much, but we do. We talk almost daily in our group chat with B. We don\u2019t hang out often. They like to go out and drink all night, we like to go to breakfast so don\u2019t often link up to hang out in person, but we talk almost daily. \n\nI don\u2019t think it changes your point much, but I wanted to clarify", "only valid comment", "I can only explain so much on Reddit. There\u2019s some more background that plays into my therapists decision/advice but I would have written a novel. It plays into a bunch of other issues I have with not letting go of or healing from trauma in the past.\n\nThe wedding will basically be a high school reunion, and I/we think it will do more harm than good. \n\nLike, I get I\u2019m being petty or a baby but why should I have to struggle with my own mental health, just so he isn\u2019t hurt that I didn\u2019t show up, ya know? \n\nEither way you look at it, someone is gonna have hurt feelings/emotions and I think I\u2019m doing the right thing by sending a gift to show I care, but not going in person to avoid any negative consequences. \n\nI appreciate the feedback, and I will take it into consideration!", "Thank you for the feedback! It\u2019s been an ongoing conversation with my therapist and wife, but I wanted unbiased Reddit folks to weigh in as well. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d regret it too much. \n\nThank you again, for the feedback.", "Thank you, for the feedback. You make many good points. Thank you.", "Snowflakes can turn into an avalanche. It\u2019s not that simple, but thank you for the feedback!", "I\u2019m trying to avoid going and being a sourpuss. \n\nI get I\u2019m being somewhat of a baby, but my feelings are still hurt. \n\nI\u2019m also trying to be respectful of him and his wedding, which going and being a sourpuss would be extremely disrespectful. \n\nI\u2019m still happy for him, that\u2019s why I will send him a gift to celebrate their relationship, but I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to go in person. \n\nThank you, for the feedback!", "I would say so, yes. It just plays into a bunch of other healing I need to do. \n\nI appreciate the feedback, thank you!", "Never said I wasn\u2019t happy for him. \n\nI plan on sending a very personalized gift, for that reason. I\u2019m still happy for him, it just feels like going to the wedding is not worth the energy", "I mean, gender has nothing to do with this. I\u2019m no less of a man, for not going or feeling the way I do. \n\nThanks for the feedback.", "Totally agree with you. No one likes to admit that you aren't viewed equally in a friendship, but time does that. Not bad friends at all, and A I imagine is totally oblivious to this even being an issue at this point.", "There is no evidence that A's views on friendship are more shallow. I would argue the opposite. The OP doesn't value friendship. His focus has been on academics, his girlfriend now wife, and his career. Memories of middle school sleepovers, a group chat, and the very occasional plate of flapjacks isn't the foundation for a close friendship. Those sleepovers were more than half a lifetime ago. I have found that many members of the shut-in culture are very judgemental of those of us who aren't. They think of parties and socializing very negatively. I don't think that hosting BBQs, dinner parties, and watching live music makes a person shallow. It makes them more interesting.\n\nA, on the other hand, has friends with whom he interacts regularly. He has actively built a social circle. He has people in his day to day life. They share experiences and adventures out in the world and in each other's home. These adult friends are featured players in each other's daily life.", "In his head, he clearly thought they were and is only now coming to that realisation. Doesn't mean he can't still be a friend, just not as close as they were once, never said expected to go to the wedding just to either reach out or acknowledge his friends big day.", "You're making it completely about you.  And this really is snowflake behavior, the very definition thereof - not being able to accept that people change and move apart / move on.  You may not like it but, it really and truly is.", "But his MeNtaL HeAlTh!", "Glad it's even a little helpful. Good luck with your decision!", "You last spent time in person in a year ago? You're \"an old friend\" which is why he invited you to his wedding. You're not \"a close friend\" which is why you're not a groomsman. There's nothing wrong with folks growing apart as they get older & nothing wrong with where you're friendship is now, but it makes total sense that his groomsmen are made up of people he likely sees far more often than a yearly breakfast and group chat. You're entitled to your feelings, but I do still lean towards YTA for skipping an old friends wedding simply because he didn't put you in the wedding party. If you want MORE distance in your friendship, you're on the right path.", "Sometimes its a harsh lesson to learn when other people don\u2019t \u201cvalue\u201d us the way we value them. But he obviously cared enough to invite you regardless. Although I understand your upset in the situation, i don\u2019t think it would he a good thing to skip the wedding. Weddings don\u2019t happen often in someones life, you don\u2019t often get do-overs. I think you\u2019d regret it if you didn\u2019t go.", "You're specifically not going because you weren't a groomsman though. So all of those other issues would have magically disappeared if you were made a groomsman?", "If you\u2019re not going to regret it too much why all the drama on not being a groomsman.

The fact we don\u2019t hang out all the time doesn\u2019t make us any less of friends in my mind. We still talk all the time, and are friends. I just thought we were closer and it hurt to find out we aren\u2019t. \n\nEspecially when I know for a fact he sees one of the other guys even less than he sees B and I.", "Thank you. I will absolutely take that into consideration! :)", "Not being made groomsman opened my eyes to how he views our friendship, so ya, it would have been different. \n\nMy conversation with my therapist would have been \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard to be there, but I\u2019m so happy for my friend and being in his wedding, that it\u2019s worth putting up with it\u201d \n\nBut now, I see he doesn\u2019t value our friendship the same way I did and so it wouldn\u2019t be as easy to show up, mask and be happy. Ya know? \n\nSo, ya, I\u2019m happy for him but I\u2019m happy for most people that find the happiness of marriage. \n\nI don\u2019t have the sense of overwhelming happiness for him, that would have made dealing with the night easier.", "Yeah that\u2019s what makes no sense. I won\u2019t regret skipping the wedding but I will throw a tantrum about not standing up in it. That seems like good evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be in the wedding", "Oh, I do. Don\u2019t you worry.", "If you didn't want people to disagree with you, and you want to be calling them names etc to the extent that you could be banned again.... Why on earth did you post on AITA?! \nYour behavior is totally spoiled and self centered and if you're so fragile you can't even take not being a groomsman from someone you've said you've drifted apart from, you clearly need many more coping strategies for the actual real adult world. \nYour therapist also seems to be enabling this, by giving you the excuse that you can't attend because of how it would affect your mental health.... For goodness sakes, how precious can you get?! You don't want to go because your jealous, and unable to deal with that maturely, don't go citing your mental health as an acceptable excuse.", "It has been 5 years since your wedding. That was only 5 years since you guys started growing apart. It has now been a decade .Just because you're not his closest friend anymore, you've basically decided you won't be his friend at all. Your therapist absolutely should be calling you out for this.\n\nYou not being a groomsman doesn't mean that he doesn't value your friendship. Absolutely ridiculous take.", "Ok. You\u2019re the one crying about not being asked to be a supposed best friend\u2019s groomsman.

Which is bad. How is ignoring my emotions and going the \u201cright\u201d thing to do? \n\nThe \u201cright\u201d thing to do in this situation is subjective and relative to the individual, which is why I reached out to Reddit. To get the different views and opinions from numerous people. \n\nSo once again, the fact that your immediate response was to call me a snowflake and disregard my feelings in the situation, tells me all I need to know about how much to value your feedback.", "> And I reported the other people that did it? \n\nlmao"]}
