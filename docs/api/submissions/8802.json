They are married and have an 8 year old child.\n\nI have known them for 4-5 years, we used to work together.\n\nNow, they are both my dear friends and I care about them deeply buy either I'm too strict or they have no self control.\n\nBasically the problem is that they often argue with each other, even in public, no matter where they are or what's happening around them. Whenever they argue, they start by being passive-aggressive and then escalate until they yell at each other, then storm off in opposite direction, abandoning whoever is with them. \n\nThey are generally quite mature and calm but for some reason, whenever they start arguing, it's like their brain shuts down and they can't avoid yelling.\n\nI have tried multiple time, in the most calm and gentle way possible, to make them understand that their behavior disturbs me and everybody else who happen to be with us when they argue. Mark seems to have understood and has not started any argument in the last couple of years but Andrea seems deaf to mine and everybody else's words.\n\nNow, a couple of days ago I transferred to my new house and I decided to organize a small party with few friends.\n\nI was roasting some burgers in the garden and cooking a pizza in the oven. Everything looked fine, until I started hearing someone screaming from the living room. I went to check and of course Mark and Andrea were arguing again because, apparently, Mark picked the wrong bottle of wine to bring to the party. I tried to calm them down, they didn't listen and I snapped. I yelled at them to sit down on the couch and I lectured them about how much they disturb me and the others whenever they argue. Andrea tried to say that it wasn't my business if and when they argue but I shushed her. I scolded them for a couple of minutes and kicked them out, then went back to the party. It was awkward for a bit but most of the people understood why I snapped and we had fun in the end.\n\nMark texted me to apologize later but Andrea wrote in the group chat that they are not children and that I have no right to scold them.

You had every right to scold them for causing issues in your home.", "NTA, if Andrea and Mark want to act like children then that's how they should be treated. Since Mark seems to have some sense you might want to suggest marriage counseling, they are definitely having a commutation issue and if they're like this in public I shudder to think what it is like in their home.", "NTA.  When people argue to the point of yelling, their brains actually DO shut down or at least go offline.  The nervous system switches to a phase (\u201csympathetic\u201d) where logic and problem solving are gone, replaced with primal survival mode.  They need to learn to recognize when either themselves or the other is getting triggered and then WALK AWAY from the situation until both are more regulated or feeling normal. Then they can discuss the issue at hand.  Somatic Experiencing therapy would be a perfect fit for them.  That said, you are entitled to set boundaries for yourself.

You shushed them and told them to sit and listen while you scolded and lectured them. \n\nYes, they were behaving very badly, but what you did was try to shame them into submission. You're not their parent. Don't try to behave as though you are. Set the boundary, and if they refuse to respect it, tell them they are no longer welcome in your home. End the friendship if you need to, but don't patronize them.", "ESH - yes they are acting like children, but that's not a reason to act like their parent.  I mean, you shushed her.

It\u2019s really disrespectful to argue in front for other people and it\u2019s more shameful to argue in front of dear friends. Andrea should come over with a pie and apologize with her husband. Show her their thread, maybe they will understand.

They are toxic together!", "ESH.  Kicking them out was the right move, and they need to find better conflict resolution, but it's not your business to police their marriage (or anyone else's) and tell them what their boundaries are.

Time for more drastic action.", "NTA And she is wrong, the moment they start openly arguing in your home and in front of others they invited everyone into their relationship. \n\nI knew a couple like this and it was horrible. Especially because they constantly denied how bad it was. Until they got into a huge fight over something insanely stupid at a mall and someone recorded it and posted it on Twitter.
