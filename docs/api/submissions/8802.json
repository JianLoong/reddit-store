They are married and have an 8 year old child.\n\nI have known them for 4-5 years, we used to work together.\n\nNow, they are both my dear friends and I care about them deeply buy either I'm too strict or they have no self control.\n\nBasically the problem is that they often argue with each other, even in public, no matter where they are or what's happening around them. Whenever they argue, they start by being passive-aggressive and then escalate until they yell at each other, then storm off in opposite direction, abandoning whoever is with them. \n\nThey are generally quite mature and calm but for some reason, whenever they start arguing, it's like their brain shuts down and they can't avoid yelling.\n\nI have tried multiple time, in the most calm and gentle way possible, to make them understand that their behavior disturbs me and everybody else who happen to be with us when they argue. Mark seems to have understood and has not started any argument in the last couple of years but Andrea seems deaf to mine and everybody else's words.\n\nNow, a couple of days ago I transferred to my new house and I decided to organize a small party with few friends.\n\nI was roasting some burgers in the garden and cooking a pizza in the oven. Everything looked fine, until I started hearing someone screaming from the living room. I went to check and of course Mark and Andrea were arguing again because, apparently, Mark picked the wrong bottle of wine to bring to the party. I tried to calm them down, they didn't listen and I snapped. I yelled at them to sit down on the couch and I lectured them about how much they disturb me and the others whenever they argue. Andrea tried to say that it wasn't my business if and when they argue but I shushed her. I scolded them for a couple of minutes and kicked them out, then went back to the party. It was awkward for a bit but most of the people understood why I snapped and we had fun in the end.\n\nMark texted me to apologize later but Andrea wrote in the group chat that they are not children and that I have no right to scold them.

You tried time and again to let them know calmly and that didn\u2019t get anywhere. They were causing a scene at your home - you were right to make them leave.", "NTA Couples who behave that way have zero idea how annoying it is for everyone around them. It's a way of life for them, you just pointed out it wasn't the time or place and people don't want to be around it.", "NTA. If they are not children, they shouldn't act like they are.", "NTA\n\n>  I yelled at them to sit down on the couch and I lectured them about how much they disturb me and the others whenever they argue.

Andrea needs to have a look at her actions and understand this is not ok.", " Andrea screaming over the wrong bottle of wine is a warning sign. TheHotline.org has resources to help you recognize when your friends are in abusive relationships. Please do a little reading and if you see other warning signs in their relationship, reach out to Mark with support and encourage other friends to do same.", "NTA You wouldn\u2019t have treated them like children if they didn\u2019t act like children. If they are arguing in your presence especially in YOUR home, they made it your business.", "NTA. Your friends are making others uncomfortable so you were straight to the point and honest with them. I would have kicked them out, too. Just because they can't control their tempers doesn't mean that others need to be subjected to their arguing.   \nI feel sorry for their kid having to listen to them fight like they do. \n\nIf it was me, I would be replying to Andrea's message in the group chat that you wouldn't have to treat them like children if they didn't act like children and she needs to grow up.", "NTA, they sound like children with the same maturity level of one. You had every right to scold them for causing issues in your home.", "NTA, if Andrea and Mark want to act like children then that's how they should be treated. Since Mark seems to have some sense you might want to suggest marriage counseling, they are definitely having a commutation issue and if they're like this in public I shudder to think what it is like in their home.", "NTA.  When people argue to the point of yelling, their brains actually DO shut down or at least go offline.  The nervous system switches to a phase (\u201csympathetic\u201d) where logic and problem solving are gone, replaced with primal survival mode.  They need to learn to recognize when either themselves or the other is getting triggered and then WALK AWAY from the situation until both are more regulated or feeling normal. Then they can discuss the issue at hand.  Somatic Experiencing therapy would be a perfect fit for them.  That said, you are entitled to set boundaries for yourself.  I\u2019d suggest you stop inviting them to anything for awhile and otherwise avoid them until they make some changes around self control and being appropriate.", "OP, you are not the bad guy and you did the right thing calling them out. The couple you mentioned with the way they behaved are actually embarassing you and embarassing themselves. NTA to you for calling it out\n\nThere is a time and place to sort an argument like real human beings and adults. Plus them behaving that way ruins the peaceful atmosphere and people's good mood. It also takes away people's right to a good time and some peace and quiet", "NTA.

The only person you can change is yourself.  End this futile effort.", "ESH. You tried repeatedly to set a boundary with regard to arguing in front of you, and that's perfectly reasonable. What's not reasonable is treating them like children in front of your other guests and insisting that they subject themselves to your scolding as if they were naughty children. You shushed them and told them to sit and listen while you scolded and lectured them. \n\nYes, they were behaving very badly, but what you did was try to shame them into submission. You're not their parent. Don't try to behave as though you are. Set the boundary, and if they refuse to respect it, tell them they are no longer welcome in your home. End the friendship if you need to, but don't patronize them.", "ESH - yes they are acting like children, but that's not a reason to act like their parent.  I mean, you shushed her.  If they can't control themselves, ask them to leave.  If you decide to invite them back again, let them know that you'll ask them to leave if they start arguing.\n\nThis is not your circus, stop adopting the monkeys.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing by kicking them out. I'd be embarrassed to have friends like this, especially around other friends of mine. Do they not have any sense of shame at all? Their poor child. When mom and dad have no problems fighting like that publicly, I can only imagine what the fights at home look like.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think you handled that well. Kick them out if they\u2019re causing a scene, but you shouldn\u2019t have ordered them to sit down and lectured them. At the very least, kick them out and then call or visit to discuss this issue after your other guests are gone.", "NTA. If they don't want to be embarrassed for getting scolded like a child they should quit acting like embarrassing children.", "NTA. It\u2019s really disrespectful to argue in front for other people and it\u2019s more shameful to argue in front of dear friends. Andrea should come over with a pie and apologize with her husband. Show her their thread, maybe they will understand. I hope for an update.", "NTA... but I think you need to go a step further and say you're no longer going to invite them to large gatherings until they prove they can behave yourself when it's just the three of you.  \n\n\nIt sounds like they have their own issues that they need to solve, it sounds like a very toxic relationship.", "NTA. I mean if they don\u2019t have the common courtesy and decency to behave well at a gathering and this is a regular , it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise when someone reaches they limit and blows up at them. I\u2019m with you on this", "YTA. They are not children and you had no right to scold them. You also don't have the right to be the spokesperson for for \"the others whenever they argue\" \n\nYou DID have a right to address the behavior at the party as if everyone in the room was adults -- something along the lines of \"You are going to have to keep your voices down or I'm going to have to ask you to leave\" and/or \"I'm afraid I cannot be around you when you argue like this so I'm going to have to leave\" when not at a party at your house.", "NTA\n\nAct like kids, get treated like kids.", "NTA, holy crap Andrea seems like a joy to be around.", "I have to vote NTA even though you are the funniest *sshole in history.

She just wants to be right ! Instead of settling the argument later in private, let's just escalate it ! Who cares if she wrecks the vibe !\nWhen she gets called out for it ,instead of oh I don't know, maybe reflect on why they got called out ...nope ! Will not admit to anything .\nEven if I was wrong, you should have never scolded me like I was a brat ( even though I was acting like one ). At least the dude is remorseful! They are toxic together!", "ESH.  Kicking them out was the right move, and they need to find better conflict resolution, but it's not your business to police their marriage (or anyone else's) and tell them what their boundaries are. If it's a constant issue when you guys hang out then don't invite them.  The lecture portion was inappropriate", "ESH\n\nThey behaved like children, but treating them like it, is not all that respectful of them as adults.  And their way of communicating isn't your business ...\n\n... until they bring conflict into your home. You have every right to ask them to leave if they are making you, or your guests, uncomfortable.  Your house, your rules. And yelling fights aren't allowed. You've discussed it nicely. Time for more drastic action.", "NTA And she is wrong, the moment they start openly arguing in your home and in front of others they invited everyone into their relationship. \n\nI knew a couple like this and it was horrible. Especially because they constantly denied how bad it was. Until they got into a huge fight over something insanely stupid at a mall and someone recorded it and posted it on Twitter. Of course eventually someone saw it and forwarded it to them. Wow did seeing themselves like that change their attitude and relationship. \nAlways wanted to find that stranger who posted it and buy them a drink.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
