Why would your coworker have a panic attack in their room if you weren't there? Were you planning on sleeping together? \n2. Hotel rooms lock from inside, you only need the keycard from outside. Thus, this \"room not properly locked as key left at reception makes no sense. They wouldn't be able to get into the room without the keycard.\n3. Hotels have emergency keycards and security carry master keys. At no point can you lock the room so securely that hotel staff cannot enter in case of an emergency \n\nThere's a lot of incoherence here", "NTA\n\nYou attempted to let your coworker know, they didn't answer, you left a message.", "Based on the situation given, I would say NTA - You were out for work and had plans of your own. The fact that your co-worker panicked after finding that you were not staying at the hotel was not your fault. You made attempts to contact your co-worker and you did inform the reception that you were not returning after your plans changed.  \nIt was very kind of you to consider your co-worker's feelings throughout the situation, however, I believe that you are not at fault.", "No, it\u2019s weird they\u2019d put 2 coworkers in the same room to me anyway.", "Unless you are lovers, I have no understanding why it matters where your spent the night? NTA. A work trip comes with guidelines to support employees in business. It does not come with any demands about where you spend your free time. NTA.\n\nTBH, unless you are your coworker's care giver? The panic attack is her  personal medical problem and all adults working or leisure have to manage such things. (You communicated with her, whether she liked what you told her or not - you still gave her a head's up.)\n\nI could go on, but this is ridiculous to me. Key cards? Door not fully locked? Is she from kindergartenland?", "NTA - This is your coworker and not your mother; even if it were your mother if you're old enough to go on a business trip, then you're old enough to stay out all night if you so choose. You made a reasonable effort to let your coworker know that you were not returning for the night.\n\nThe bigger question your post actually draws is why is your employer having you share a room? I guess it is cost-saving, but it's very dumb. It's a set-up for a harassment issue, even if you're the same gender; stupid people do stupid crap all of the time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The coworker is an adult.", "INFO\n\nWas your job paying for the hotel? Or were you and your coworker paying for it?", "NTA\n\nThis is more of an Ask A Manager issue than AITA issue.  You are co-workers and they should not expect anything more of you than the common decency to let them know that you won't be there.  They shouldn't be trying to get you into trouble for being an adult with friends.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult. Co-worker wasn't tasked to be your caretaker.", "1. Because they are not used to sleeping alone and I wasn't told or made aware about the same until I heard they went and spoke about it to another coworker.\n\n.\n\n\n\n2. Never thought about the 2nd point. I kept blaming myself for not thinking about the security of my coworker.", "The whole guilt trip just whines of, \"YOU DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO ME AND I EXPECTED YOU TO BECAUSE I CRAVE ATTENTION!\"", "Most places that do this don't have a real HR. I see it a lot where I live, but I've only ever been the only woman so I never had to share. I've felt terrible for the guys and would absolutely hate doing that..I need some decompression/alone time.", "The job was", ">Because they are not used to sleeping alone and I wasn't told or made aware about the same until I heard they went and spoke about it to another coworker.\n\nI'd be very wary to associate myself with this colleague in future. Can't sleep alone so expected you, a person from work to share a room? \nThat's a ridiculous stand. What if you were someone who doesn't like to share rooms?\nI wouldn't have agreed to shared room", "Then they need to get used to sleeping alone FFS. Grown people can't make outsiders responsible for their frailties. (Nagging unrest about being away from home,  feeling isolated, or uncomfortable with the unfamiliar settings is a real enough problem, certainly. But, they just aren't your responsibility to fix for her. Most adults would never tell a coworker, \"I'm afraid of the dark and just really feel overwhelmed in unfamiliar housing, so I need you to stay beside me so I can sleep!\" after all.)\n\nYou tell your lover, or your sibling, or your best friend things like that.

They can't require you to actually make use of the bed in the assigned room, though. That's because in your free time, no one can demand that you work. You didn't have clients to be responsible for or responsive to. You aren't a den mother. And where you sleep is not in your job description as it relates to your actual work. So, I would not stress that part. ;-)", "Yeah I can't speak for your job, but i know if my job paid for a hotel room and they found out I didn't use it, I'd be in major trouble for abusing funds.", "No one cares if you use your shared hotel room on a work trip", "NTA, why do you have to report to a coworker or the hotel? \n\nThat\u2019s just weird and partially an invasion of privacy.", "Your company is cheap if they made you share a room. Gross", "NTA but in what world do people share a room on a work trip?", "NAH, to be fair. If I woke up in the middle of the night and found a \u201croommate\u201d hadn\u2019t returned when expected, I would be a bit worried. I probably listen to too many murder podcasts and whatnot, but I would hope someone would notice if I didn\u2019t come back at night. I\u2019ve also had the unfortunate experience of a hotel employee using their cards to come in to my hotel room before, so I get wanting to use all the locks.\n\nThat said, you tried to reach them; it\u2019s not your fault the call didn\u2019t go through. You did the best you could.", "NTA.\n\nHaving a card key at the reception for you isn't leaving the room unlocked.  You'd have to show ID to get it.  And it's not your responsibility to watch after a co-worker.  You went to go see a friend and were courteous enough to let your co-worker know, that wasn't even strictly necessary (but polite of course).\n\nYour co-worker needs to suck it up and deal, it's not like you brought a stranger back to the hotel, then we'd have something to consider.", "NTA. I was in almost exactly the same scenario lately. I got laid and coworker got to have the room to herself for one of the nights of our trip. Win/win. Your coworker is a freak.", "NTA. If they need a carer, your coworker needs to make the appropriate accommodations. Unless your job is to babysit, it is nobody else's business where you lay your head (or don't) at night.", "NTA, but I can see both sides. As far as not properly locked - usually there is a slide bolt or something that you can lock that keeps anyone from getting in, even with a key. Idk if I would have been comfortable without it fully locked down", "Isn't \"same sex\" a bit redundant in 2023? I mean, I am purely gay.", "Well, you tried calling her and left a text. What she \"thought\" is on her.\nOnce again, you are not the nanny or guardian of your co worker", "I(F)would absolutely not share a room with a man, but I\u2019d have no qualms sharing with a lesbian.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the possibility of sexy, it\u2019s about me feeling safe.", "That's very understandable. Straight men are at the top of the people committing crimes, and you need to be safe when you are vulnerable\n\nTo be honest, I do not want to share room with anyone. As a single gay man, I'd only feel safe at night in a hotel if I'm alone and it's a locked door"]}
