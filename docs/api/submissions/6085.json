OP seems very emotionally mature for the age, Gabe, less so. Understanding that, Gabe probably lashed out defensively and may be embarrassed/feel singled out. Apologize for the misunderstanding (be bigger person) and CALMLY explain that maybe as wifi is a shared resource all roomies can agree large downloads are fine but appreciate at the appropriate time and with notice if will monopolize wifi for extended periods. Be respectful if you expect it back. Remove emotion other than empathy and just be factual but firm. Same skills needed for negotiating with all ages toddler to adult.

The sulky roomie will have no room to complain when its going to happen with others too. If they do stuff involving large file downloads.\n\nIt should also have no impact on any online play the roommate may be doing. Those packets should get the same priority as other streaming traffic. It should just throttle file downloads (and any other deprioitized types of traffic).\n\nThat makes it the most polite and fair method of dealing with it.\n\nThrottling the traffic of the console itself, as someone else suggested, would be targeted and impact all of its traffic. Better to leave that as a fallback option.\n\nKicking the console off the network, as more than one comment has mentioned, is pretty much a declaration of war.

That works fine for 3 people who don't do more than reddit, FB and Netflix 90% of the time. \n\nBut the PS4 will eat it all up when doing downloads. Wired or not. It's a nasty little hog.

At least not yet.", "Or just find the circuit breaker for his PS4 and flip it and then say you have no idea what happened.\n\nNTA", "Or depending on what you have at your house you could just block it from the actual internet. I have hard lined internet in my house, but upstairs I have a mesh system. I can block my stepson's computer from accessing the Wi-Fi up there, very easily. I have had to implement it before when he got in trouble for some things. Fortunately he now realizes that stepmom is not messing around and will absolutely take the internet from him haha", "But I assume you would give him the password for his phone/laptop? What would then stop him from entering it on his PS4?", "Huh?!  Wireless connections are almost always slower than wired.  If you don't believe me run a speed test on a wireless connection and then run it on wired.  The wired connection will be faster.  Most internet connection speeds are marketed with the wired connection speed rather than wireless.\n\nThe reason for this is some routers can't handle higher speeds and so the connection is automatically metered.\n\nAt my family's vacation condo if you try to download something over wireless it could take ***days***, if you switch to a wired connection it's done in 30 minutes.  We're in a hurricane zone so the building is reinforced concrete which can interfere with the signal.  If you're browsing the internet, it isn't a problem.  It's only an issue if you try to download something.", "I\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had home WiFi that was faster than the *wired* Ethernet connection to that same router.\n\nWhat exactly kind of equipment are you busing?", "if the ps4 is hogging the internet, you cold change the password temporarily while he's out. or kick the ps4 from the network", "I think they mean changing the password on the spot to kick the PS4 off the WiFi. Then changing the password back when the roommate gets home.", "If he's already gone, he can't re-enter the password until he gets home.  Then if he pulls that stunt again, change the password again or change the password back to the old one before he gets home.", "If you have a 50mbps connection to the internet, and your wireless is capable of, say, 200mbps, then the bottleneck is, in fact, the internet connection speed. Now, if you're in an area where you can't get a strong signal, and the best you can get is 25mbps, then yes, connecting directly to the router will get you a faster speed. But it still won't have any effect on other wireless users. The only time a direct connection to the router is absolutely, always going to be faster is when your internet connection speed is faster than your wireless. But in those cases, you'd probably already have connected anything that's capable of being directly connected.\n\nWhere I am, I have 50mbps down. And I get about that speed on both my phone (wireless) and my computer (wired) unless I'm really far away from the router. If others are using the internet, obviously, it's slower... But that applies whether I'm on the wireless or directly connected, because again, the connection speed to the internet is the bottleneck.\n\nNow, some routers automatically prioritize data going to wired connections. But that's a setting and it can be changed, it's not something inherent to the technology.\n\nAnd yes, all of this assumes we're talking about data being transferred between a device and the internet. All bets are off if you're transferring data between devices on your network- in that case, the direct connection will always be faster with current technology.", "Faster than the internet connection. Yes, the wired connection is faster to the local area network, so, between devices that are on your network, but if your internet connection is slower than both, it's not going to matter.", "At my house I have 200mbps down over a wired connection.  For wireless the speed test pings back at 150mbps, unless I'm sitting right on top of the router (it's supposed to be the same as wired but even the ISP techs have said speed drop-offs still happen because router technology hasn't caught up with internet speeds).  Distance plays a role in wireless speed and so does battery charge.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that for most home internet a wired connection is going to be faster than wireless, especially if you aren't in the same room as the router.", "Right. But they\u2019re talking streaming and downloads. So it\u2019s not about between devices on their network. It\u2019s about communicating with severs on the outside. That\u2019s what has people confused by your comment, I think.", "You're sorta missing the distinction between LAN and WAN. \n\nLAN, meaning local area network, is your home's internal network. Wired connections between computers with sufficient hard drive speed are capable of saturating (fully utilizing) a typical 1 gig ethernet link.\n\nWAN, meaning wide area network, would mean the entire internet. It sounds like your connection to your internet service provider is 200 mbps or so, so your connection is faster than typical wifi allows. \n\nMany people have WAN connections in the 20-100 mbps range, very common. In those cases wifi is more than sufficient to saturate your WAN link and you'll not see significant speed differences for downloads via wifi vs cable. Stability and packet loss may be improved via cable though, which is often considered a good idea for gaming.", "So you have a much faster internet connection then I used as an example, then. And likely a slower wireless connection, either by nature (802.11n routers are inadequate for 200mbps speeds) or because the ISP has artificially limited it. Both of these are very common with ISP-provided routers, partly because it's cheaper and partly because it sort of reduces overall traffic and allows them to stretch the number of subscribers on a particular line a bit. If you got your own wireless router, say, one that meets 802.11ac or ax standards, turned off the wireless supplied by your ISP, plug your own router into the ISP access point, you'd almost certainly get better wireless than you are now. Yes, distance from the router would still affect things, as well as local interference. But again, that's a limitation between your device and the router. It wouldn't affect other wireless users because your router would still have bandwidth to spare."]}
