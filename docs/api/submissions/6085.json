If he wants the ps for him alone he needs to have this in his private bedroom. The living room is for everybody and he cannot digitally occupy it. \nIt sounds like he is an addict to games and the only thing he worried about, not your well-being or understanding that you can spend time in the living room as well.

And to download large files at night, while everyone is asleep.", "NTA, I was sure you were gonna say you forgot to unpause the download.  But you didn\u2019t!

Fuckhead sounds like he will be getting booted out of shared housing quite soon and sent back to Mommy\u2019s house for some more coddling.\n\n-edit: You still would not be an AH if you did forget to unpause it.  That just makes you an extra nice person.", "NTA.\n\nGabe is a psycho.  He needs to not be your roommate anymore.\n\nWhen you can't have your own place for whatever reason, you don't get to commandeer all the electronic bandwidth and common areas.  I get being irritated that he couldn't start the game when he got home, but he can't really expect the rest of you not to use the TV in his absence.\n\nI'd get a lock for my door if I were you until you don't have to live with him anymore.  Take this to the landlord.  If you think he would actually be dangerous, that's a whole other issue.", "NTA. He's hogging the shared spaces and the Internet, he's the AH. You three are all letting Jim walk all over you.

OR there\u2019s something shady going on that he doesn\u2019t wasn\u2019t people knowing.", "NTA he is being super inconsiderate expecting you all to put up with laggy internet because he wants to download a game! He should do the download overnight like normal people.", "NTA doesnt he have a bedroom? Why is he hogging the dining room? That isnt fair.", "NTA but who set up the internet?  Do you have your own router or are you using your internet providers?  It\u2019s either really slow or the PS4 is prioritized over other traffic. With your own router you could cap his internet speeds so it doesn\u2019t harm everyone else\u2019s experience.", "I love reading these stories about clueless, obnoxious, and entitled roommates.\n\nIts cathartic after dealing with them myself for years.\n\nYou're obviously NTA, your roommate is TA, and I very much suggest you follow the other suggestions and throttle the network speeds to the PS4.", "NTA. He sounds like an absolute fucking child.", "Who pays for the internet? If it's all of you, then you all have right to use it while your in the building. He can't use it so much that no one else can't use it.\n\nYour housemate needs to have some respect and think of others. \nIf he does it again then pause his game but I would not mention it to him.\n He's a WiFi hogger.\n\nYNTA but roommate sure is.", "NTA. He can't take up all the bandwith when he's not even home.", "Break the internet bill down evenly according to each data use \u2026..", "Nta, next time disconnect the router for 5 mins and plug it back in, the ps4 will give error in the download and youll be able to use the wifi properly", "NTA and if possible throttle his ps4s connection when he isn't home. Using all the bandwidth when you aren't home and others are is bad form.", "NTA. However see if your internet router has any settings for QoS or Smart Queues and turn them on. It'll automatically throttle down his PS4 downloads just enough to allow the Netflix stream to work unbuffered. \n\nDepending on what y'all have it might not be an option, in which case buying a third party router might get you going.", "NTA  I'm sorry your 13 year old son is acting out, he'll outgrow this childish and selfish behavior one day....OH WAIT...I mean your 20 year old roommate...guess it's too late to hope he'll grow up.  Seriously though, next time just unplug the thing.  Or reboot the router. Oh, and next time his controller is on the chair, just sit on it and loudly say 'oops that shouldn't be there' as you then nudge it onto the floor.  Wouldn't want to get yelled at again for *picking it up* like a normal person.  Is he an only child?  He really doesn't seem to have learned the basics of communal living.", "I see a lot of NTAs here, but sorry, for me, it's a ESH, sure he shouldn't be using up all the bandwidth, but shit, don't touch other people's belongings. Heck, disconnect him via the router, next time, just don't touch his shit.", "NTA, in my opinion if he doesn't want his downloads managed while he is out of the house, the only solution is the PS4 stays off while he's out of the house, and if he's insistent you can't touch IT, well, you can certainly touch the socket it's plugged into.\n\nIf he's being unreasonable there's no reason not to match him.", "YTA and I say this because you didnt have the right to get on his console without permission. In case ppl are unfamiliar with consoles you have to log into the console and go into settings to pause a game. He had to actively go through this persons personal electronic device( your opinion on whether a gaming console count is irrelevant.) Just like phones laptops tablets and other personal electronic devices it can store and contain a lot of personal information. Secondly I assume the roommate pays for part of the Wi-Fi bill so they had a right to be downloading the game. Just because I\u2019m not in the home doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not still paying for my part of the Wi-Fi.  Thirdly unless your Wi-Fi is complete dog shit it shouldn\u2019t take more than 15-20 minutes for even a massive download.", "Yeah, he is doing it BECAUSE he isn\u2019t there, so it doesn\u2019t inconvenience him! All the more reason to stop it.", "The PS4 shouldn't be in a shared space if he's that anal about it.", "I would just tilt the chair and let the controller slide on the floor. Then he can't complain because I didn't touch it", "Alternatively if that's not possible, the house can develop a strange power surge each time he hogs the bandwidth. Oops ps4 turned off,  tough luck I guess.", "Nope, cause then he will keep doing this b/s with impunity!", "That's not true at all! My husband is constantly downloading games onto a PS4 so I know it's a one button pause. Source: have had to pause Arkham downloads for same reason. This wouldn't even make sense in this story because why would OP have their roommate's login info? It's also not true that games only take 15 minutes to download, lots of games take hours to download over wifi. \n\nI don't know why you would take an \"incase people are unfamiliar\" tone and then say a bunch of untrue things?", "Why do you enjoy lying?", "A shared living situation really doesn't work that way. I hope you live alone.", "True but imagine he locks it up in his room while using all the internet for his downloads while not at home lol. \n\nWould make him even more of an asshole tbh.", "Yeah thought about this myself, a bit petty but probably exactly what I would do as well in such a situation.", "\"I _really_ wanted to reboot your PS4 to resume the download after that happened, but you told us not to ever touch it.\"", "If you reboot the Wi-Fi and change the password it won\u2019t let him connect without the new one"]}
