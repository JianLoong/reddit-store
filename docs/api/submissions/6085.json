Apologize for the misunderstanding (be bigger person) and CALMLY explain that maybe as wifi is a shared resource all roomies can agree large downloads are fine but appreciate at the appropriate time and with notice if will monopolize wifi for extended periods. Be respectful if you expect it back. Remove emotion other than empathy and just be factual but firm. Same skills needed for negotiating with all ages toddler to adult.

The sulky roomie will have no room to complain when its going to happen with others too. If they do stuff involving large file downloads.\n\nIt should also have no impact on any online play the roommate may be doing. Those packets should get the same priority as other streaming traffic. It should just throttle file downloads (and any other deprioitized types of traffic).\n\nThat makes it the most polite and fair method of dealing with it.\n\nThrottling the traffic of the console itself, as someone else suggested, would be targeted and impact all of its traffic. Better to leave that as a fallback option.\n\nKicking the console off the network, as more than one comment has mentioned, is pretty much a declaration of war.

That works fine for 3 people who don't do more than reddit, FB and Netflix 90% of the time. \n\nBut my PS4 will eat it all up when doing downloads. Wired or not. It's a nasty little hog.

What would then stop him from entering it on his PS4?", "Huh?!  Wireless connections are almost always slower than wired.  If you don't believe me run a speed test on a wireless connection and then run it on wired.  The wired connection will be faster.  Most internet connection speeds are marketed with the wired connection speed rather than wireless.\n\nThe reason for this is some routers can't handle higher speeds and so the connection is automatically metered.\n\nAt my family's vacation condo if you try to download something over wireless it could take ***days***, if you switch to a wired connection it's done in 30 minutes.  We're in a hurricane zone so the building is reinforced concrete which can interfere with the signal.  If you're browsing the internet, it isn't a problem.  It's only an issue if you try to download something.", "I\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had home WiFi that was faster than the *wired* Ethernet connection to that same router.\n\nWhat exactly kind of equipment are you busing?", "if the ps4 is hogging the internet, you cold change the password temporarily while he's out. or kick the ps4 from the network", "I think they mean changing the password on the spot to kick the PS4 off the WiFi. Then changing the password back when the roommate gets home.", "If he's already gone, he can't re-enter the password until he gets home.  Then if he pulls that stunt again, change the password again or change the password back to the old one before he gets home.", "If you have a 50mbps connection to the internet, and your wireless is capable of, say, 200mbps, then the bottleneck is, in fact, the internet connection speed. Now, if you're in an area where you can't get a strong signal, and the best you can get is 25mbps, then yes, connecting directly to the router will get you a faster speed. But it still won't have any effect on other wireless users. The only time a direct connection to the router is absolutely, always going to be faster is when your internet connection speed is faster than your wireless. But in those cases, you'd probably already have connected anything that's capable of being directly connected.\n\nWhere I am, I have 50mbps down. And I get about that speed on both my phone (wireless) and my computer (wired) unless I'm really far away from the router. If others are using the internet, obviously, it's slower... But that applies whether I'm on the wireless or directly connected, because again, the connection speed to the internet is the bottleneck.\n\nNow, some routers automatically prioritize data going to wired connections. But that's a setting and it can be changed, it's not something inherent to the technology.\n\nAnd yes, all of this assumes we're talking about data being transferred between a device and the internet. All bets are off if you're transferring data between devices on your network- in that case, the direct connection will always be faster with current technology.", "Faster than the internet connection.

For wireless the speed test pings back at 150mbps, unless I'm sitting right on top of the router (it's supposed to be the same as wired but even the ISP techs have said speed drop-offs still happen because router technology hasn't caught up with internet speeds).

Wired connections between computers with sufficient hard drive speed are capable of saturating (fully utilizing) a typical 1 gig ethernet link.\n\nWAN, meaning wide area network, would mean the entire internet. It sounds like your connection to your internet service provider is 200 mbps or so, so your connection is faster than typical wifi allows. \n\nMany people have WAN connections in the 20-100 mbps range, very common. In those cases wifi is more than sufficient to saturate your WAN link and you'll not see significant speed differences for downloads via wifi vs cable. Stability and packet loss may be improved via cable though, which is often considered a good idea for gaming.", "So you have a much faster internet connection then I used as an example, then. And likely a slower wireless connection, either by nature (802.11n routers are inadequate for 200mbps speeds) or because the ISP has artificially limited it. Both of these are very common with ISP-provided routers, partly because it's cheaper and partly because it sort of reduces overall traffic and allows them to stretch the number of subscribers on a particular line a bit. If you got your own wireless router, say, one that meets 802.11ac or ax standards, turned off the wireless supplied by your ISP, plug your own router into the ISP access point, you'd almost certainly get better wireless than you are now. Yes, distance from the router would still affect things, as well as local interference. But again, that's a limitation between your device and the router.

NTA though...", "wtf kind of garbage internet do you guys have that slows down from someone downloading a file?\n\nNTA but i feel like there's something else going wrong with your internet tbh", "NTA\n\nIf OP has any interest many routers have an admin config section they can sign into like a website, they can set a priority for certain devices, traffic types and sometimes assign download limits. \n\nSo go in, find the IP/Mac address of his PS4, set it to lower priority for its traffic(i.e. it gets put on the back burner compared to Netflix/YouTube), or simply disconnect it from the WiFi from the router side(you haven't touched his stuff)\n\nBut Gabe is an AH, he works nights, the time when most people sleep, is the perfect time to update those huge ass game files, when noone else is using the internet. And when he comes home, it would be done! \n\nBut also, if Gabe is gonna leave stuff running 24/7 might have to assess that in relation to energy bills and the proportion he pays.", "Glad to know I\u2019m not he only one who would do this! However I\u2019m wondering if this wifi hogging roommate needs to invest in paying more for internet so they can get a higher bandwidth?", "Fiber optic internet will save families. I wish more routers made it easier to split up bandwidth so multi user environments weren't so flakey at times. MU-MIMO helps somewhat but doesn't prevent the actual Internet connection from being swamped.", "OP can't kick him out. \n\n> We all got separate leases with the landlord.\n\nBut as the WiFi is running on his name/account he hopefully can block the ps4 or slow it down... or look for something else.", "Just block it for good, lol. He can buy his games on disc and download the patches over his mobile phone data...\n\nAnd yep, don't understand the fuss over an old PS4... he behaves like it's a brand new PS5 at the very least.", "I would understand had OP not try to contact Gabe, but he did and Gabe didn't pick up. Gabe also seems to have a bad habit of ignoring people's calls.", "He's hogging the Wifi that EVERYBODY pays for when he's not even home, to the point that those who are home can't even use it! Gabe is being the AH, not OP.", "First of all, OP tried contacting Gabe, but he never answered. It's not like he wanted to snoop in his PS4.\n\nSecond of all, Gabe is hogging the Wifi while he's not even home, to the point where those who are can't even use it! Gabe is being the AH, not OP.", "Gabe shouldn\u2019t be in shared spaces either, with the way he behaves and thinks.", "Gabe needs his own dedicated wifi.", "I'm getting single child vibes from this kid.", "He's still using a service he paid for, whether he's hogging it or not. You charge him an extra percentage, but you don't mess with his possessions. That's when you go to asshole territory.", "just go into the router settings and limit his download to 25 kb/s if able to, it's more painful than kicking him off because he likely won't know how to fix it, or that it even happened, and might get his own wifi.", "Does it not have the option to limit download speeds and download over a longer period of time?", ">\tlimit his download to 25 kb/s\n\nWell now we\u2019re just being petty. I like it. Especially if one could set that up so it only happens during the hours he\u2019s typically gone from house. Then he\u2019d really wonder what was going on.", "Or just pay for some slightly modern internet speeds", "True. Even my phone hotspot can do both... will just slow down the download accordingly (to really, really slow, lol, but it doesn't stop my netflix). \n\nMaybe OP needs to check if roommate hasn't prioritised the ps4 and change it back to the least priority. Or block the ps4 from the WiFi and only allow it over night (thought I'd be too lazy to change it all the time). \n\nDoesn't change the fact though that the roommate is a selfish AH and should keep anything he doesn't want touched in his own room instead of throwing a fit...", "So, you would rather have the asshole with the PlayStation continue to eat up internet bandwidth?  Most people don't understand technology, changing the password is the easiest and *safest* fix.  If someone doesn't know what they are doing, they could brick the router.  If the router is from their ISP, they're going to have to pay for it.  If they damage the router, they'll have to pay for it.", "Nope. Just on or off. Max speed or nothing. Especially in Rest Mode, it tries to use it's max download potential. (something like 1000Mbps wired, 450Mbps wifi?)\n\nMy router can block it, but I cant figure out how to get my router to only limit it. So I do my downloads at night, or at least when no one else is home.\n\nHell, it'll even trip over itself to do downloads. I had to stop downloads in the past because they werent letting the cloud streaming games thru. It was literally prioritizing background downloads over stable gameplay lol.", "nah, just set it up and if he asks if the internet is being slow for anyone else, just say yeah. He won't know the difference lmao, it usually doesnt even effect online gaming, just downloads.", "It can, not necessarily is. \n\nCut my PS4 off plenty of times accidentally (power cuts for example) and it is still completely fine... it's just that any warranty or insurance wouldn't pay out in that case that's why they're so adamant about it. \n\nAs almost every PS4 is old and not worth much anymore most people wouldn't have any warranty/insurance to begin with. Obviously it'll still be upsetting loosing it over something stupid like this. It can be fatal, but I honestly think it's a very rare occasion that this actually happens.", "Technically speaking this can happen to all electronics. It's why we use surge protectors. Higher end electronics will be more susceptible, and it can be exacerbated by improper wiring, overloading your circuits, and like you said, electrical storms or lightning strikes sending surges up the line.\n\nIt's probably more likely than you think, as anytime there is a storm causing power outages there's going to be a handful of people in the area who need to replace electronics, but there's also going to be thousands who have nothing go wrong.", "That's incredibly fragile, and something I've never heard of with Nintendo products. You could throw your gamecube out a window and it'd likely still function.", "They pay equally for the utilities that he's running up when he's not even home and that seems fair to you?", "Surge protection is part of the electricity installation in every home unless you live in idk some weird ass historical building maybe.", "First of all, nowhere was I defending the roommate. All I said was getting at was that OP could be liable if he did as the person above suggested and just shut the off the breaker because it could damage the PS4. And secondly, in my experience of paying bills, an internet bill is not like a power or water bill, it doesn't go up with usage. You pay flat amount for certain speed."]}
