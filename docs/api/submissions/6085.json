He is a bad flatmate.", "NTA - you need to tell your roommate that he has to share and share a like the common resources you all pay for.  His demands that no one pause a download when he wasn't even home smacks of extreme entitlement.  He needs to get over himself and IF he goes through your possessions without any reason other than spite then you and the other two roomies need to band together and clearly make it 3 against 1!!!", "NTA\n\nGabe is acting like a spoilt brat and throwing a tantrum.\n\nNext time just lie if you need to pause his download and deny all knowledge.

I'm fascinated to know what he's got on there that he's so nervous about you finding.\n\nIf you're not allowed to \"go through\" it next time he does it, just unplug the thing.", "NTA\n\nLook into whether or not QoS is enabled on the router.
