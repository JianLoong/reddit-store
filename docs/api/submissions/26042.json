{"id": 26042, "submission_id": "167inzm", "title": "AITA for looking out for my new coworker by telling her that her food might be upsetting to others?", "selftext": "I (32m, white) am potentially in trouble at work, but I don't really think I deserve it.\n\nMy coworker, \"Anna\" (23-ish f, asian), is new at our office and she brings her own lunch on days we don't have a food truck. On Thursday (yesterday), she brought in a homemade stir fry and used our shared microwave in the break room to do it. I was in the room when she took it out of the microwave, and it smelled heavenly. I asked her about the recipe and she told me it was just a bunch of ingredients and spices thrown together as to not waste any veggies that might go bad soon. \n\nWhen I was telling her how good it smelled, I also mentioned that some other people at the office might think it would be too smelly or ethnic (as in, racist people tend to look down on \"ethnic\" things). I have read those kind of stories on here about microagressions when it comes to people of color and the food they bring in, and I wanted to warn her that she might not want to bring it in anymore so it doesn't happen to her. I emphasized that it smelled good to me personally, though.\n\nI guess a couple of the other co-workers in the room overheard our conversation, because after Anna left the room, some of them sort of quietly told me how it was inappropriate for me to have said that. I told them that it's true, that ethnic food gets ridiculed for smelling too strong and that I disagreed with that senitment, but I also think she would face less harassment if she didn't bring in that food anymore. One of my other coworkers then said that \"I was the only one harassing her\" and making insinuations that her food is problematic, plus the fact that she hasn't even been bringing in her own food that often since she just started last week, so there couldn't have been an opportunity to have had this hypothetical harassment happen to her. I just wanted people, yes, even the assholes, at the office to make her feel welcomed.\n\nI left work that day not thinking anything of it, until the following morning where I hear from a different coworker that Anna talked to our HR department about the conversation and how she was \"hurt\". I'm a bit frustrated as to why she didn't talk to me about it first since it was just a misunderstanding and that I'm looking out for her. I did notice that today she was trying to dodge me, which is unusual and a bit heartbreaking. I just want to work things out. I wanted to be a friend to her and help her out since this is one of her first jobs out of undergrad, but this has been blown of out proportion. Now my coworkers think I'm racist, but I really try my best to be an ally, but then again what do I know?\n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling her that her food might be a bit too much for other potentitally racist people in the office to handle?", "created_utc": 1693601384, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167inzm/aita_for_looking_out_for_my_new_coworker_by/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your coworker is a grown woman who's been Asian her entire life. Do you genuinely think she's unaware that racism exists? All you did was put her on edge around coworkers who may not even be racist! Congratulations, you're the one who created the microagression.", "YTA\n\nSo your coworker was peacefully enjoying her lunch, and you goosestepped over there like the microwave police to tell her that Some People would find her food too' ethnic'.... but Not you because you're one of the good white people \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26 but then you go \"no but actually the racists are right you are asking for racism by bringing Asian food in\" \n\nYTA \n\nstop being racist to your coworker she was just trying to eat her leftovers ffs\nGet out of your white fragility shield and recognise your own awful hurtful behaviour and learn from it and the feedback you're getting please", "YTA.\n\nYou are the mircoagressor", "Anna is Asian and she brought a *stir fry*, a dish that is now super Americanized, so you felt the need to let her know that potentially racists might target her food based on race. Would you have done the same for a white person eating a stir fry at work?\n\n* Ana is Asian and you treated her differently because of her race. That's racism. \n* You were on the look out for her, protecting her against a situation that didn't arise. Ever heard of the \"White Saviour Complex\"?\n* Instead of thinking \"if the racists arise, I will tell them off\", you thought \"She should erase herself, so the racists get no ammunition\". That's not how you help people from minority group. You don't ask them to code-switch so the sensitivities of the bigoted can be protected. \n* The hell is \"ethnic\"? \"Not white\"?\n* Why do you say that she was \"hurt\" with quote marks? Who are you to decide that her feelings are not valid?\n\nIf someone approached you to tell you \"Other people might maybe think [you're a potential mass shooter]/[you can't dance]/[the spiciest condiment you can handle is mayo]/[you will start mansplain everything], but they're being racist and/or sexist, **I** for one think you're swell! :D\", unprompted, wouldn't you feel at least a little bit annoyed with their unneeded intervention?\n\nYTA. Go apologize.", "YTA -- you are not protecting her from racists, you yourself are being racist. if you're trying to convince us/her/yourself that you're an ally, you might be more than a bit delusional. \n\nalso stop trying to hang around your young coworker lmao", "YTA was pretty racist what you did buds", "So you told a new coworker \"in order to avoid harrassment about your food, you shouldn't bring in your food!\"\n\nDo you realize that you just harrassed her?\n\nYTA\n\nI suspect this is bait, but the judgment is the same if it is true or fake.", "YTA.\n\nYou came off like this: \"SOME people might say that your food is smelly. Not me though. But SOME PEOPLE.\"\n\nAnd then you proceeded to call her food Ethnic. You might as well have worn a shirt that said SOME PEOPLE on it with an arrow pointing to your face.\n\nDoesn't sound like you were ill intentioned, but sometimes you just have to give a complement and let it be.", "YTA. You acted like the very people you wanted to warn her about. Telling someone that their food is too ethnic *is* a microaggression. You basically told her to assimilate and leave her culture at home on, what, her first week at a new job? Way to make her feel welcome.\n\nThe fact that your coworkers told you off should have been enough to make you apologize to Anna, rather than carrying on with your day thinking all was well. Of course she went to HR. You were being racist about her food under the guise of what \"other people\" might say. Why would she assume that it was a misunderstanding and talk to you first?", "YTA - what you did was tell her that she needed to conform to the white culture at the work place. That is incredibly exclusive. If you wanted to be her ally, you would tell the others to shut their trap if they said anything not tell her that she needed to change to fit on. Who wants to fit in with small minded bigots anyway?", "YTA   If your white coworker brought in egg salad and and tuna fish sandwiches would you tell them that might smell offensive to your Asian coworker?", "YTA \n\nYou're not the Company Food Police so just stop it. Apologize to her THROUGH HR (Do NOT approach her!) then start minding your own business. Please.", "I think what you are missing is...\n\nShe didn't make ethnic food. I make rice and leftover veggies and random spices, I'm white. \n\nYou saw Asian lady and presumed ethnic food. Then you got on your big dense white horse and tried to make a show of fighting off imaginary racists.\n\nThat's what you turned this poor woman's lunch into.\n\nYTA if you're real.", "YTA. You were racist. That's like telling a black man in 1931 that people might be upset and him for walking on the street so he just shouldn't walk on the street.", "YTA.  So...instead of having her back and encouraging her to report someone to HR if they DID  start harassing her, you told her she should change her behavior to appease the racists.  I get that you didn't mean to be hurtful, but you definitely still were.", "YTA ! So you're pandering to the (hypothetical!) other racists' sensitivities AND making her feel very much unwelcome all by yourself.\n That you claim you're \" looking out for her\" is an irony lost on you...", "YTA!  \nThe food shaming is coming from you! You are the one causing an issue where there was none...  \nEven if someone (other than you) didn't like her food, it is her own business and decision to eat whatever she wants...", "YTA.  Majorly so. You warned her about something that hadn't happened and may never happen. So then only person that sounded racist was,  hmmm, you.", "YTA - so you read about micro aggressions and then thought you\u2019d try to try and top trump them with an act of overt racism?!? \nIf you wanted to be an ally, ironically the appropriate action would have been to call out people like yourself who made any comments about Anna\u2019s food being smelly or \u2018ethnic\u2019. It would definitely not be referring to her food as \u2018ethnic\u2019 or insisting that \u2018other people\u2019 would have a problem with it", "YTA so many times over. Why tell someone that their cooking smells wonderful, but then go on to tell them that it might offend others because it is \u201cethnic\u201d. Of course she is offended. She likes her lunches and you turned it into a problem.  She wasn\u2019t eating anything unusual or smelly. Don\u2019t you think it is awfully presumptuous to decide that you are the microwave police? That you alone can judge if someone\u2019s lunch is American enough to be acceptable at work? I\u2019m glad HR is taking it seriously.", "YTA.", "YTA If you want to be a ally if you notice people saying the things you speak up and tell them to knock it off, you may as well go up to someone and be like  don't leave the house because some people are racist.", "YTA and a racist.  A clueless and intrusive racist. And if she weren't asian you would not have thought anything about it. But you found it offensive. \n\n I'm surprised you didn't tell her that it would be best if she went back to her own country to eat it.  That's what you meant when you said she should eat it at home.  \n\nThat poor woman, being accosted and shamed for being asian at her new job.  You destroyed any excitement and joy she had about her new pisition . Not only does she have to avoid the obvious racist, but she has to wonder who else is alligned with you.\n\nETA: As an asian and a woman, the last thing she needs is advice on dealing with bigotry from a clueless white male.  \n\nAnd the textbook line a bigot uses to shame another is \"I'm fine with it, but others might not be.\"\n\n You should be fired.", "You messed up. YTA. In case you didn\u2019t know white people also eat Asian food. White people also eat leftover Asian food. Would you have said the same to a white person who brought in a stir fry for lunch?", "JC, YTA. This has not been blown out of proportion. You need a serious wake-up call.", "YTA\n\nYour motives don't matter here. You were at least undiplomatic. The message starts with the recipient.  \nBut in effect you have encouraged the same racist microaggressions that you say you want to fight. By reproducing the racist language and interpretation and even recommending ethnic subordination.", "YTA. Being an ally does not mean telling people of colour about racism and microaggression! \n\nWhat, you think she\u2019s not aware of racist behaviours??\n\nYou were the only person to bring up the problem when there was no problem. You were the one who caused the problem.\n\nWhat you did **was microaggressive and rude.", "YTA.  It's not that you worded things wrongly, it's that the idea you had was wrong.  IF other employees harassed her, they would be the ones behaving inappropriately, not her.  It's not on the victims of racism to try to figure out how to carefully live their lives so as to not invite racists to act racist to them.  It's on racists to stop doing racist things, and thinking racist things.  You intervening to try to \"prevent\" theoretical racism towards her in the future didn't prevent harassment- it reinforced to her that if someone harassed her, it would be her fault because she didn't avoid it.    \n\n\nYou also need to realize that there's not ways to avoid bigots from saying/doing ignorant things to you when you're of minority status.  If it's not the food, it will be the clothes she wears, how she wears her hair, an imagined accent or any other thing they can find to harass her about.  Bigots find a way to be bigots, and it's not the responsibility of their victims to try to find a magical way for the bigots not to notice they are different from them.", "YTA \n\nYou need to learn how to be quiet.", "What is wrong with you? \n\nYTA", "YTA\nFor making her feel uncomfortable, and for your impressive lack of self awareness. \nYou really need to do some work on yourself!", "YTA. Stop worrying about potential racists in the office and stop trying to \"save\" her ahead of anything. The only one causing issues now is you.", "OP, the call is coming from inside the house", "YTA oh my god OP, your lack of self awereness is killing me. \n\nBy saying that to her, you created immediatly an hostile environment like \" yeaaahh !! be careful with your innofensive \"heavenly ethnic (really girl)\" food, it might upset some coworkers hihi Oh yes we have openly racist coworker apparently it's a thing here, welcome to the family doll love the smell give me the recipe :)\" \n\nBut it's a good thing you ask the question so you don't make the same mistake again in the future. Because what you did is the definition of a micro agression. Get it together.", "YTA. If someone (anyone) put fish in the office microwave, okay, I\u2019d probably say something, but not any of what you said! There\u2019s so much WTF here I don\u2019t know where to start.", "YTA\n\nSo because you read some silly shit on the internet means you should \"warn\" your coworkers??? Why stop there??? Might as well warn her that one of your coworkers could be a mass shooter... Cause that's happened. OH! don't forget that you read about a guy that followed a coworker home!!! She should know that because someone did that in Bangladesh, that she had better be careful in California cause it could happen here too!!!", "Sorry but you handled that incredibly badly. I can't believe you said her food was \"ethnic\" and lumping that in with smelly (implying she was smelly?). I shudder to think what else you said.", "YTA. You warned her for the office racist; yourself.", "YTA\n\n  I'll be blunt.  I cannot imagine a single non white person who would take your comments at face value.  The \"some other\" people comment really comes across as you trying to push a point without taking responsibility for it.  There is absolutely no way I'd address it with you one-on-one either.", "You are upset that when you approached a woman who didn\u2019t know you very well, and told her that, while you yourself would never call her food \u201csmelly ethic\u201d, you *could* smell that it was the kind of food *other* people thought was \u201csmelly ethic\u201d food, that she didn\u2019t come to you to discuss it further? YTA.", "YTA. This is so absurd it seems fake. But what the heck, here we go. \n\nGiving the benefit of the doubt that everything you say about your motivations is accurate. You\u2019re STILL an AH. Let\u2019s look at what you actually said\u2026.\n\nHey minority employee. You\u2019re new here and while I think your food smells super yummy, there might be racists here. If they smell your oh so yummy food that\u2019s clearly ethnic, they may suddenly realize you\u2019re not white and be racist towards you! So you should avoid offending the racists and prompting them to treat you poorly by acting as white as you can when it comes to the food you eat. Now again, I think your food smells SO good because I\u2019m not racist but others here really might be! \n\nWhy is your solution not to stand up to anyone racist enough to give a co worker crap over the food they eat. \n\nAlso, do you really think only Chinese people eat Chinese take out at work? Or only Hispanic people would dare to bring in some spicy enchiladas? \n\nBesides, isn\u2019t it universal work etiquette that you can microwave anything that isn\u2019t fish/seafood?", "Unfortunately, yes, YTA. It's a well-known ruse to refer to \"some people\" to express one's own racist views. I am NOT saying you are insincere! But it wasn't your place to step in where there was no conflict and start talking about some imaginary people whose offenses might or might not ever materialize. If they did materialize, the young lady would be filing complaints with HR about *them*. You created a completely unnecessary drama where there was none, and she complained about *you.*", "YTA-The only coworker acting racist about her food is you.", "YTA. \n\n\"I know people commit microaggressions on people of color, so I decided to be a good ally by committing the microaggression first.\"\n\nI can guarantee that you, a white man, do not need to mansplain microaggressions to any person of color ever. *Ever.*", "Top tip, keep your mouth shut when it comes to people\u2019s food.

The fact that you thought it necessary to tell the newbie shows how absolutely clueless you are.\n\nTake the chinning and learn to keep your opinions to yourself", "You, sir, are a racist.  Who the fuck is going to complain about the smell of oriental stir-fry?  What if a white person brought in oriental food for lunch?  Would you have told them not to bring it because it stinks and other racists like you wouldn\u2019t like it?", "YTA. You can't cancel out your racism by saying \"not me\".  Some people will not like the smell of your ethnic food so you shouldnt bring it, not me of course.  Some people round here won't feel comfortable if you speak in native tongue, not me of course. Some people around here don't like people of your skin colour/who dress the way you dress/who believe in the religion you do, not me of course. Nope YTA and the racist.", "YTA.

On Thursday (yesterday), she brought in a homemade stir fry and used our shared microwave in the break room to do it. I was in the room when she took it out of the microwave, and it smelled heavenly. I asked her about the recipe and she told me it was just a bunch of ingredients and spices thrown together as to not waste any veggies that might go bad soon. \n\nWhen I was telling her how good it smelled, I also mentioned that some other people at the office might think it would be too smelly or ethnic (as in, racist people tend to look down on \"ethnic\" things). I have read those kind of stories on here about microagressions when it comes to people of color and the food they bring in, and I wanted to warn her that she might not want to bring it in anymore so it doesn't happen to her. I emphasized that it smelled good to me personally, though.\n\nI guess a couple of the other co-workers in the room overheard our conversation, because after Anna left the room, some of them sort of quietly told me how it was inappropriate for me to have said that. I told them that it's true, that ethnic food gets ridiculed for smelling too strong and that I disagreed with that senitment, but I also think she would face less harassment if she didn't bring in that food anymore. One of my other coworkers then said that \"I was the only one harassing her\" and making insinuations that her food is problematic, plus the fact that she hasn't even been bringing in her own food that often since she just started last week, so there couldn't have been an opportunity to have had this hypothetical harassment happen to her. I just wanted people, yes, even the assholes, at the office to make her feel welcomed.\n\nI left work that day not thinking anything of it, until the following morning where I hear from a different coworker that Anna talked to our HR department about the conversation and how she was \"hurt\". I'm a bit frustrated as to why she didn't talk to me about it first since it was just a misunderstanding and that I'm looking out for her. I did notice that today she was trying to dodge me, which is unusual and a bit heartbreaking. I just want to work things out. I wanted to be a friend to her and help her out since this is one of her first jobs out of undergrad, but this has been blown of out proportion. Now my coworkers think I'm racist, but I really try my best to be an ally, but then again what do I know?\n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling her that her food might be a bit too much for other potentitally racist people in the office to handle?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "You are the racist here bud. YTA", "Beyond stories you have read, is there any evidence that people in your office would react negatively?  There does not seem to be any.  Therefore, while your heart was in the right place, your actions mean YTA.", "YTA. Seems pretty obvious you \u201cjustifications\u201d of trying to help her out are just em there so you don\u2019t look like the bad guy. As your coworkers said no one else was bothering her about it, just you.", "YTA.\n\nShe\u2019s Asian. Do you really think she didn\u2019t know she might experience micro-aggressions? It gives strong mansplain vibes, and I almost never use that word. It\u2019s like telling a black person that they might experience racism. Like duh, of course they know that. They don\u2019t need your secondhand knowledge. \n\nThis also insinuated that you and her co-workers wouldn\u2019t welcome her because of her food. You literally stated that some might harass her so you were warning her of things that never happened at your workplace. This is the opposite of creating a friendly environment when the warning is hypothetical. Also, while some warnings can be helpful, they\u2019ll never make a person feel safe since by definition they put people on guard.\n\nI think you should apologize to her. Explain that you shouldn\u2019t have said that. Say you had been trying to look out for her but then realized that what you said was actually harmful and not helpful and that you\u2019re sorry for hurting her.", "Just in case this isn't a joke - yes YTA.  yes, you are the racist person who is making her feel bad about the food she brings in.", "YTA you are like those parent who ridicule their kids cause they think other kids will too. Like how is that better? You became the racist bully to warn her about racist bullies? Wtf", "Not just an asshole but a stupid one at that.", "Dude really? You \u2018REALLY\u2019 don\u2019t get it? An old white guy telling a young Asian woman that her homemade food might \u2018upset\u2019 people at work isn\u2019t HUGELY problematic? Seriously? You don\u2019t see that?", "It almost sounds like you're racist but also the food was way too yummy smelling for you to just ignore it. Like you probably were hoping it'd be strong and pungent and you could tell her to stop bringing that nastiness in to the office, but you go thrown off by it smelling so good. \n\nBUT GOOD NEWS OP\n\nThis is an excellent way to overcome your racism -- smell yummy food, then taste it, and then come to love and appreciate other people's food... And bingo, you'll no longer be racist!", "You\u2019ve read about those people\u2026. You literally ARE one of those people .", "Is this a joke? You the special white man felt the need to warn the Asian lady that racism exists and she should not bring her nice food to try and avoid it. Nobody can be this stupid right?", "It is absolutely not her job to prevent getting racisted at.", "\"Hey, OP, I think your dessert looks delicious, some people might think it causes diabetes, tho.\"\n\n\"Hey, OP, that new truck of yours is amazing, some people might think you are contributing to global warming, tho.\"\n\n\"Hey, OP, so nice you have been working out, some people might think you are narcissist, tho.\"\n\nThat's how you sounded. YTA, and you might want to talk to her and apologize for your dumbness. She might not forgive you but you definitely need to apologize.", "Pretty sure an ally would stand by her if any harassment had come up, as in defend her and tell others to shut up. Managing her food is in fact a pretty bad thing to do...\n\nYTA", "YTA: You don\u2019t tell people to make themselves hidden to avoid bullies. Why don\u2019t you speak up if people are mean to her instead?", "YTA\n\nThis is also a racist take. This isn\u2019t looking out for her. You can also hold racist views without intentionally trying to be racist, so you should probably understand that. Leave her alone and never comment on other people\u2019s food ever again.", "YTA.", "YTA you really need to try and absorb what your coworkers are saying to you. I hear you\u2019re well intentioned but everyone is explaining what the issue is to you and you\u2019re not listening. Additionally your coworker shouldn\u2019t have to avoid bringing in food of yer choosing to avoid this hypothetical harassment. Being a true ally looks like exactly what your other coworkers did in calling you out on your behavior.", "Not only are you an AH, but a stupid one at that. You didn\u2019t think this was inappropriate on your part??  Were  you purposely trying to make her uncomfortable?  Wtf was your reason for even going there other than to cause strife?\n\nJust so you know, OP, I have never heard anyone complain that food \u201csmells too ethnic.\u201d\n\nHard YTA!", "Wow \u2026 why do white people find it so hard to mind their own business? YTA", "YTA. Stop trying to \u2018warn\u2019 people. That is not the way to be an ally. Being an ally is saying something if and when someone is racist or inappropriate. No one was. Except you. You made her feel uncomfortable, all by yourself.", "YTA. All you had to say was that it smelled heavenly. Period. You took it a step further, and what you said to her wasn't fact, it was opinion.", "This is like walking over to a minority and saying \"hey! I think you're awesome! But some people here might think (insert racist stereotype) though. I'm just trying to protect you and give you a heads-up that some bad people may think like that\".\n\nLike.. you don't think she knows how racists think? You mentioning it to her OUT OF NOWHERE, as if you're being an \"ally\", IS micro-aggression. YOU thought of the racist thing before anyone else. You brought it up. You tried to teach a POC that racism exists lmao. You tried to be a \"white savior\" in this instance. Like why did you even think of the problematic thought in the first place?\n\nWhy did you mind jump to, \"Oh that's delicious - but racists might hate it\". Like WHAT. YTA.\n\nAnd to tell her she shouldn't bring her food for your hypothetical reason?????", "YTA and describing it as ethnic is just plain racist. I quite frankly don\u2019t give a shit about what people eat at work. I do however draw the line at the person in my office who kept putting mackerel tins in the office waste paper basket", "YTA. Whitest thing I've ever read...Your \"allyship\" is performative and you have done no work.", "YTA, her lunch wasn't even offensive, a stir fry is a very standard dish for lunch  Take the feedback on your behaviour to heart and start treating your colleague as just any other, not your \"ethnic coworker\".", "YTA! \"Watch out for the racists! You're other and they hate other\" like do you not hear yourself. Nonwhite ppl don't need to be reminded that racists and racism exist.", "The racism was coming from inside the house. YTA", "YTA. you\u2019re the harasser. you\u2019re the racist.", "You sound racist here too...", "YTA.  The only microagression in that post came from you.  And uh, using the word ethnic while pretending to look out for her is so cringe.  You deserved a HR complaint.", "The call is coming from inside the house OP\n\nYTA", "So hey what ya got there?   Oooh it\u2019s something from your \u201cculture\u201d? Wow well I think it smells interesting and all but there may be some people who think it\u2019s not appropriate to bring in because of well the different smell being from your \u201cculture\u201d and all. But hey enjoy your lunch.  OP you cannot be that dumb.  YTA", "YTA this has got to be fake. You mansplained racism to her like she hasn\u2019t been Asian her entire life.", "YTA. You were \u2018protecting her\u2019 from the REAL racists, hm? ::eyeroll::", "C", "YTA", "YTA.  Of course YTA here.  Dude, what you did was othering and othering = racist.  \n\nIf there are potential racists in the office, then the way you show yourself as an ally is by standing up against them if they say anything racist.  Nice of you to pat yourself on the back that you can find \"ethnic\" food appealing, but you need to STFU.  Her food isn't \"ethnic\", it's her lunch.  Unless it's full of peanuts and you have a peanut allergy, the only appropriate things to say are either that smells good or nothing at all.\n\nGlad that your other coworkers called you out on it, just wish they had spoken up while Anna was still in the room to hear them.", "This post is a joke right? YTA. I can\u2019t believe you had to come to Reddit to come to that conclusion. Of course Anna went to HR. You made her super uncomfortable with your offensive comments about her food! What did I just read?", "YTA.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not the least bit racist, here\u2019s the racist thing I did. But I\u2019m not racist!\u2019", "Exactly. She's going to be well-aware and if she isn't somehow, maybe your workplace won't be full of AHs. The OP went out of his way to make her self-conscious and create a problem that doesn't exist.\n\nYTA. Also, OP,  you should also be aware that plenty of people who claim to be allies pull stuff like this. \"Kindness\" that is condescending at best or at worse, a cover for their bigoted opinions by deflecting the blame onto others. I don't blame her for going to HR.", "White people \u201cteaching\u201d POC about racism (sigh", "She 100% sees a negative post about white people and she has to hop in there with \"not all white people, I...\"", "OP: \"I've read some stuff about micro-aggressions\"\n\nAlso-OP: \"some un-named people might think your food is too ethnic and smelly\".\n\nFFS.", "It wasn't even that micro!", "Truly excellent post.", "I wish I had an award to give you", "LOL \"also stop trying to hang around your young coworker\" was exactly my thought too!

We already know she's young, he likely finds her hot and imagine how grateful she could have been to him from preventing her from the disgrace of someone complaining about her food.
