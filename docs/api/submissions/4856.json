{"id": 4856, "submission_id": "zn8fj5", "title": "AITA for not helping a lady out to her car at the end of my shift?", "selftext": "Some backstory, I currently work at a grocery store to save up for college. At this store our hours are usually 6 a.m. to 12 a.m. The only time when those hours change is Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve (6 \n a.m to 5:30 p.m.). \nFlash forward to Thanksgiving day, I was working at a register from 9:30-5:30. As expected, we were moderately busy. At about 5, this lady ( let\u2019s call her Diane) comes to my counter and proceeds to put her stuff on the belt. She, then, asks if I know where to find folding chairs and tables. I told her to look in our seasonal department or home section. She walks off without finishing unloading her cart. No problem. This happens all the time. I ring up the stuff in that cart and bag it. About 15 minutes later, there\u2019s still no sign of her. I call my SC (service coordinator) and she goes to look for her. Diane, eventually, comes back with two more full carts of items. She says she couldn\u2019t find them so I call that department and have them meet me at my register. However, Diane decides to roam around again looking despite me telling her that someone is on the way.\nAt about 5:30, the announcement comes across the store that it is closing. I keep my lane open because Diane still had not checked out yet. Not long after, I see two employees pulling 3 more full carts without Diane in sight. It takes 3 department heads and the store manager to find her after 30 minutes of looking. At this point, she has thousands of dollars worth of Christmas stuff (because it was on sale) and she has still not paid. Lo and behold, she had walked into the back of the store, where no customers are allowed, and yelled at a completely different department head to help her find her stuff.\nThey proceed to bring Diane to my register to finally pay for her stuff. \nHer checkout was when she really blew up. She first started saying that no one had helped her at all. Next, she argued that the store was ableist( had she asked, someone would have definitely helped her through the whole experience). She then proceeded to yell at everybody in ear shot to never shop at the store again. Then, we come to the payment. Obviously, her card declines and she demands that we speak to her bank. Legally, we are not allowed to do that. My manager proceeds to help her through the checkout. This kind gesture is met with her cursing at us. \nIn total, Diane spent over 5,000 dollars and had nine different carts. We had to get people from different departments to even help get her to her car. Since I saw that there was enough people, I clock out and start to head for the door. She yells at me and asks where I\u2019m going. I politely tell her my shift has ended. She demands that I help her to her car. Her demand is met with me continuing to walk out the door with my headphones on. I\u2019ve gotten mixed responses on my actions during the entire event. I do not regret what I did but I\u2019m wondering what some of y\u2019all might think.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671173536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zn8fj5/aita_for_not_helping_a_lady_out_to_her_car_at_the/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Other staff's job is to show her where stuff is, and they did their best to do so.\n\nIt's no one's job to call her bank or take stuff to her car for her unless she has paid for that service, which despite her total bill, she has not paid for.
