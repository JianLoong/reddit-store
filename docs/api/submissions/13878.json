The other day while discussing a possible guest list, my mom mentioned the family of a girl I went to school & said \u201cThey\u2019ll of course be invited\u201d.  There was a moment of silence after she said it, then I responded saying that they wouldn\u2019t be. She got pretty offended by that & pretty much said that it wasn\u2019t up to me. \n\nHere\u2019s the back story - \n\nI went to school with this girl, we\u2019ll call her Sam, from K-8th grade. In 2nd grade my mom started signing me up for sports. Simultaneously Sam\u2019s mom did the same & we ended up on the same teams. Our moms met through going to games, would sit together & over time became friends. Before this Sam & I didn\u2019t interact in school. But after, our families would have dinners together & our moms often planned sleepovers for us.\nRight away Sam didn\u2019t like me. If parents were around she was nice but if not she was brutal. I was a nerdy, overweight child - an easy target for bullies & Sam quickly became my biggest one. She destroyed any confidence I had. & When we went on to middle school, the bullying went to social media, where to her there were no rules. It got pretty rough after that. \nFor other reasons, I ended up going to a different high school than Sam. Mom finally stopped making plans on my behalf so I cut contact with Sam & I guess since our moms didn\u2019t have us bringing them together anymore they did too. \nFlash forward after years of not being in contact my mom recently started chatting again with Sam's mom, we\u2019ll call her Jill. They went to lunch to catch up & I guess are hoping to stay in touch. \nIt\u2019s important to note I\u2019m not a fan of Jill either. She used to gossip about the kids in my class, saying disgusting things about literal children. & in middle school she made fake IG profiles posing as kids who went to different schools to befriend kids in my class to get info about us & what we were up to. I only found out because my mom let it slip years later\n\nNow back to the current conversation. I told my mom that I saw no reason to invite them given the history & that I haven\u2019t had any contact with them in years. She said they were her friends & it would hurt their feelings if I didn\u2019t Invite them. I told her she can be friends with whoever but they don\u2019t need an invite to my wedding if I have no relationship with them. We went back and forth a bit then the conversation ended with her saying she was disappointed in me & expects me to change my mind. She said that people change & I shouldn\u2019t hold Sam's actions against her. I agree with her, that people can change. But Sam\u2019s words/actions had a big impact on my life & I had to work really hard to get past it. At this point I feel like both of our lives have gone on fine without each other & I see no point disrupting that. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if I'm in the wrong & if I should just invite them for my moms sake.

And I am saying all that because you seem to focus just on the \u201cwhose feelings are more important\u201d and not on the more important part of your comment where you completely dismiss the bullying. That is the disgusting attitude here. It is possible that I\u2019m sensitive there as I was bullied myself but I hate the \u201cthey were kids\u201d attitude, it\u2019s just as harmful as saying \u201cboys will be boys\u201d.

If she is helping contribute, then it would be appropriate to let her invite a few people, but even then you can say no to certain people, and this family would be one of them. I am totally down for parents getting to invite some friends/family that the couple don't know well IF they are contributing, but that doesn't mean they can invite people you actively don't want to associate with, you still control the guest list. And if your mom isn't paying, well then double no reason for them to be there. \n\nJust be clear with your mom- no, this family isn't invited, end of story.

Any time she brings it up, walk away or end the conversation. If she makes even one passive aggressive comment, call it out- mom, no, we talked about this, and I can't believe you aren't letting it go, so now I am leaving- and don't let her get away with it. If she does this more than once (bring it up again), then start uninviting her from wedding stuff- no dress shopping, cake tasting, whatever, and be clear it is because you know she will raise this issue and therefore her own actions are the cause of her not going to things. \n\nAlso might consider a little security for the wedding to handle uninvited guests!", "NTA, but don't be afraid to carry this through to it's logical conclusion.\n\n> We went back and forth a bit then the conversation ended with her saying she was disappointed in me & expects me to change my mind\n\n\"Mom, I will not be changing my mind on this.  If this means you're unable to attend, I completely understand; just let me know.

You no longer have to think in terms of 'making Mommy happy.'  In fact, you need to make a point of shifting your thinking from 'mommy' to 'fellow adult.'  And so does she.
