The other day while discussing a possible guest list, my mom mentioned the family of a girl I went to school & said \u201cThey\u2019ll of course be invited\u201d.  There was a moment of silence after she said it, then I responded saying that they wouldn\u2019t be. She got pretty offended by that & pretty much said that it wasn\u2019t up to me. \n\nHere\u2019s the back story - \n\nI went to school with this girl, we\u2019ll call her Sam, from K-8th grade. In 2nd grade my mom started signing me up for sports. Simultaneously Sam\u2019s mom did the same & we ended up on the same teams. Our moms met through going to games, would sit together & over time became friends. Before this Sam & I didn\u2019t interact in school. But after, our families would have dinners together & our moms often planned sleepovers for us.\nRight away Sam didn\u2019t like me. If parents were around she was nice but if not she was brutal. I was a nerdy, overweight child - an easy target for bullies & Sam quickly became my biggest one. She destroyed any confidence I had. & When we went on to middle school, the bullying went to social media, where to her there were no rules. It got pretty rough after that. \nFor other reasons, I ended up going to a different high school than Sam. Mom finally stopped making plans on my behalf so I cut contact with Sam & I guess since our moms didn\u2019t have us bringing them together anymore they did too. \nFlash forward after years of not being in contact my mom recently started chatting again with Sam's mom, we\u2019ll call her Jill. They went to lunch to catch up & I guess are hoping to stay in touch. \nIt\u2019s important to note I\u2019m not a fan of Jill either. She used to gossip about the kids in my class, saying disgusting things about literal children. & in middle school she made fake IG profiles posing as kids who went to different schools to befriend kids in my class to get info about us & what we were up to. I only found out because my mom let it slip years later\n\nNow back to the current conversation. I told my mom that I saw no reason to invite them given the history & that I haven\u2019t had any contact with them in years. She said they were her friends & it would hurt their feelings if I didn\u2019t Invite them. I told her she can be friends with whoever but they don\u2019t need an invite to my wedding if I have no relationship with them. We went back and forth a bit then the conversation ended with her saying she was disappointed in me & expects me to change my mind. She said that people change & I shouldn\u2019t hold Sam's actions against her. I agree with her, that people can change. But Sam\u2019s words/actions had a big impact on my life & I had to work really hard to get past it. At this point I feel like both of our lives have gone on fine without each other & I see no point disrupting that. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if I'm in the wrong & if I should just invite them for my moms sake.

Your mom was being more than a little presumptuous in assuming that her friend would be automatically invited. Beyond that, bullying is the shittiest kind of formative experience, and it absolutely sticks with you. Your wedding is supposed to be a day where you are confidently the center of attention, and by no means is it your job to offer somebody else a redemption arc on your special day.

Isn\u2019t it standard practice that if the parents are paying , a few of their closest friends should be invited because no doubt they have heard all about you time and again from your proud parents.  It\u2019s customary here in USA I believe .  On the other hand , your bully from middle school should not be invited .  I wouldn\u2019t.  The parents yes, the bully no.  If OP is paying for the wedding then do whatever the hell you want .  Best wishes !", "NTA\n\nThe only slippery slope is if your parents are contributing financially to the wedding.

Remind Mom that, as your wedding,  you are inviting friends and family to *support* you and your partner as you start your new life together. A wedding is not a neighborhood potluck in which one more family won't matter.\n\nWhat is it with weaponized weddings, anyway? Got to invite neighbors or coworkers who have no connection to the couple to show off? Or use it as an occasion to irritate family? My mom asked me if I was inviting Sue and Bob. Sue is my brother's ex-girlfriend. Bob is Sue's husband. My brother was attending with his wife, who was expecting their child. Firm no on that Mom.

Those people aren't even family so the mother shouldn't be insisting that they are invited.", "Bahahahahahahaha are you kidding me? NO it\u2019s not \u201ca special day for everyone\u201d, and no one is going to agree with you on that, it\u2019s a day for the bride and groom and YES for once everyone else\u2019s feelings are less important. Mom can go a day without her friend who gossiped and her bullying daughter. You\u2019re an AH for diminishing Sam\u2019s action \u201cthey were kids\u201d omg people like you make me so fucking mad. if you\u2019d read correctly OP went to a different HIGH school because of the bullying, by then a \u201cchild\u201d should be aware of their actions.", "Grow up and forgive already, they were kids. Yeah the Mom is out of line, but that's her Mom, and she's involved, so just deal with it.", "[removed]", "The onus is not on her to forgive them. If people bully others then they will need to grow up and deal with the repercussions that come with that. Forgiveness is something that is up to the individual involved and not the choice of the one in the wrong to force it on to them.", "Wow this is sad\u2026 I hope you find a person someday that you love so much that you want to celebrate that love with the people close to you. Because that\u2019s what marriage is about. And yes the two people celebrating this union are special for this one day, it makes you sound quite narcissistic that you wouldn\u2019t put someone else\u2019s feelings above yours for ONE day", "That was far beyond the point. But science proves, unforgiveness is deteimental to health, whether she does or doesn't. She's inconsiderate to her mother, either way.", "[removed]", "Funny how you say OP is inconsiderate when her mother is the one being extremely inconsiderate of OP. She ignored her daughter\u2019s feelings and is now making a ridiculous demand to invite somebody who at worst is a bully and at best is a stranger. OP is NTA.", "How would YOU know what I know about marriage?\n\nSo do I, I also consider everyone\u2019s feelings, maybe sometimes even too much other peoples feelings before my own, and still! On the wedding day the feelings of the bride and groom are more important than other people\u2019s feelings. I\u2019m not saying that this extends to the completely unreasonable requests some bridezillas make, but I am saying than on the wedding OPs feelings trump mom\u2019s feelings. And I am saying all that because you seem to focus just on the \u201cwhose feelings are more important\u201d and not on the more important part of your comment where you completely dismiss the bullying. That is the disgusting attitude here. It is possible that I\u2019m sensitive there as I was bullied myself but I hate the \u201cthey were kids\u201d attitude, it\u2019s just as harmful as saying \u201cboys will be boys\u201d. THAT is what\u2019s been bothering me most about your comment.\n\nPs: I have no idea what negative points are, but good for you for keeping score on a fictive rating of your comments (? I guess) that gets you nothing irl"]}
