The other day while discussing a possible guest list, my mom mentioned the family of a girl I went to school & said \u201cThey\u2019ll of course be invited\u201d.  There was a moment of silence after she said it, then I responded saying that they wouldn\u2019t be. She got pretty offended by that & pretty much said that it wasn\u2019t up to me. \n\nHere\u2019s the back story - \n\nI went to school with this girl, we\u2019ll call her Sam, from K-8th grade. In 2nd grade my mom started signing me up for sports. Simultaneously Sam\u2019s mom did the same & we ended up on the same teams. Our moms met through going to games, would sit together & over time became friends. Before this Sam & I didn\u2019t interact in school. But after, our families would have dinners together & our moms often planned sleepovers for us.\nRight away Sam didn\u2019t like me. If parents were around she was nice but if not she was brutal. I was a nerdy, overweight child - an easy target for bullies & Sam quickly became my biggest one. She destroyed any confidence I had. & When we went on to middle school, the bullying went to social media, where to her there were no rules. It got pretty rough after that. \nFor other reasons, I ended up going to a different high school than Sam. Mom finally stopped making plans on my behalf so I cut contact with Sam & I guess since our moms didn\u2019t have us bringing them together anymore they did too. \nFlash forward after years of not being in contact my mom recently started chatting again with Sam's mom, we\u2019ll call her Jill. They went to lunch to catch up & I guess are hoping to stay in touch. \nIt\u2019s important to note I\u2019m not a fan of Jill either. She used to gossip about the kids in my class, saying disgusting things about literal children. & in middle school she made fake IG profiles posing as kids who went to different schools to befriend kids in my class to get info about us & what we were up to. I only found out because my mom let it slip years later\n\nNow back to the current conversation. I told my mom that I saw no reason to invite them given the history & that I haven\u2019t had any contact with them in years. She said they were her friends & it would hurt their feelings if I didn\u2019t Invite them. I told her she can be friends with whoever but they don\u2019t need an invite to my wedding if I have no relationship with them. We went back and forth a bit then the conversation ended with her saying she was disappointed in me & expects me to change my mind. She said that people change & I shouldn\u2019t hold Sam's actions against her. I agree with her, that people can change. But Sam\u2019s words/actions had a big impact on my life & I had to work really hard to get past it. At this point I feel like both of our lives have gone on fine without each other & I see no point disrupting that. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if I'm in the wrong & if I should just invite them for my moms sake.

I\u2019m not saying that this extends to the completely unreasonable requests some bridezillas make, but I am saying than on the wedding OPs feelings trump mom\u2019s feelings. And I am saying all that because you seem to focus just on the \u201cwhose feelings are more important\u201d and not on the more important part of your comment where you completely dismiss the bullying. That is the disgusting attitude here. It is possible that I\u2019m sensitive there as I was bullied myself but I hate the \u201cthey were kids\u201d attitude, it\u2019s just as harmful as saying \u201cboys will be boys\u201d.

Any time she brings it up, walk away or end the conversation. If she makes even one passive aggressive comment, call it out- mom, no, we talked about this, and I can't believe you aren't letting it go, so now I am leaving- and don't let her get away with it. If she does this more than once (bring it up again), then start uninviting her from wedding stuff- no dress shopping, cake tasting, whatever, and be clear it is because you know she will raise this issue and therefore her own actions are the cause of her not going to things. \n\nAlso might consider a little security for the wedding to handle uninvited guests!", "NTA, but don't be afraid to carry this through to it's logical conclusion.\n\n> We went back and forth a bit then the conversation ended with her saying she was disappointed in me & expects me to change my mind\n\n\"Mom, I will not be changing my mind on this.

These people, who may have changed and could in theory be lovely now, are not in my life, so it does not make sense for me to invite them. I would prefer to to use that invite for someone we both know and like. Do you think you can put aside your personal feelings and agree to support me in this?\"  (edited as I hit return too fast)", "Tell your mom if she keeps up her shit she won\u2019t be invited either. Then the 3 of them can spend the whole day together.", "NTA and I don\u2019t understand why people you haven\u2019t seen for years and aren\u2019t your friends would want to go to your wedding. I don\u2019t even like weddings where I know everyone", "NTA but she probably already invited them and that's why she's digging her heels in. Or she might invite them anyway and bring them to the wedding herself.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a piece of work\n\nMaybe you shouldn't invite her too", "NTA  \n\n\nPeople can change, but you are no obligated to give a single fuck about them.", "Exactly all of this.  OP you are NTA!\n\nDo NOT GIVE IN to your mother over her unreasonable demands, that WILL negatively impact YOUR wedding.\n\nWhy are these \"friends\" of hers more important to your mother than you OP?\n\nThat's what it boils down to with what she's saying. You could call her out on that directly.  Straight up ask your Mother why her \"family friends\" *POSSIBLE* upset is more important your ACTUAL upset and discomfort at YOUR own wedding?!\n\nThat's what your mother has been verbalising here - that you do not matter, at your own damn wedding.   And that you should care more about others who have harmed you, than you do about yourself??  Some wild shit.\n\nDamn right that should be called out for the disgusting shit behaviour that it is.", "The thing too, I think, is WHO the parents try to strong arm.\n\nMy younger brother and sister are genuinely nice people. Mum tried to strong arm one of them into inviting someone, and strong arm the other into disinviting someone.\n\nI, on the other hand, can be a bit of a dick. Mum didn\u2019t try and strong arm me in the slightest when I got married.\n\nI don\u2019t know, it just kind of makes me sad to see the nicest people get the worst treatment.", "Right I was wondering the same \u201cno pay no say\u201d."]}
