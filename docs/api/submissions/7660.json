I do it because I love her, not to shelter her or keep her in a box. She gets so upset when she fails (like emo teenager curl up into a ball and sulk in the darkness vibes) and it's really hard for me to just let it happen and fight trying to rescue her. So these holidays, I let her fail. She pays the utilities for the house. She left a lot of lights on, including the tree running around the clock. I'd do what I can to negate it but never said anything. I didn't purposely run around and burn electricity to prove a point. I just didn't fuss about it when lights/TV are on in a room no one was in all the time. I'd simply turn things off and not say anything.\n\nShe just got the bill and is flabbergasted at how expensive it was.

She chose what she was able to afford and handle, as she insisted she help out with bills. Utilities are her responsibility by her choosing, I didn't just assign them to her.

Reading your post, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re talking about your wife, but instead like you\u2019re talking about a young teenage daughter. Being treated like that can be extremely grating. Most of the other comments seem to brush that aside, and the attitude seems to be that if she wants to be treated like an adult she should act like one. The thing is, that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s trying to do! My guess is she\u2019s been sheltered her whole life and is only realizing as an adult how that stunted her.\n\nBeing sheltered from your mistakes makes it hard to learn from them. You mention how upset she gets when she fails. That\u2019s because she\u2019s been sheltered her whole life! Your wife is trying to learn, and to grow as a person. You are doing nothing to help her while you continue to shelter her against her will. Even before the electricity incident I would call you TA (which is where I think I differ from most top comments).\n\nLastly, regarding the electricity bill. I\u2019ve seen some other people call you out on this and you were receptive to it. The best way you can help her is to let her fail (when the fallout isn\u2019t too serious) and then support her as she deals with the fallout. Playing a game of \u201cI told you so\u201d does nothing to help her, and it makes it extremely clear that you missed the whole point of what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s not TA because she didn\u2019t blame you for not warning her about the bill, she just wanted some support which I think is fair.", "ESH.\n\nYou're infantalizing her, and she's acting like a child.

Then I can be an adult and choose to have it or not. If you simply said \u2018you won\u2019t like it\u2019 I\u2019d feel like you were treating me like a child. Same with the speeding.

Small things that don't do much damage are ideal for that.\n\nI'd just make sure you don't abstain from interfering when it's a more consequential kind of deal. Maybe a warning will help.\n\nOr even better, give your wife the right process to figure things out better. Asking oneself the right questions at the right time can help a lot. Letting her fail in specific situations most likely won't help future ones. Basically, give a man a fish, he eats for a day vs. teach a man to fish, he eats for life kind of deal is what I'm getting at.", "I've been in multiple relationships like that.\n\nIf I had to choose between those relationships and a nap, I'd choose the nap tbh.", "Well said.\n\nOP is coming across one of those men who views everything a woman does as a problem to be solved.

By that wording I'm thinking it also includes Gas. Knowing that the US went thru one or the worst cold snaps last month, your increase in bills is probably actually heat. Everyone's bills went up but not from lights. Even the most inefficient lights are not going to be 80 dollars. This isn't a learning curve on leaving lights on. This is most likely a learning curve in how inefficient your house is truly heated in cold weather."]}
