Here's the thing, mistakes are great, because they teach you a lot of things, and I've learned a lot from making mistakes, so it's not a bad thing to make them once in a while. But she can't complain to you when it happens and she told you not to stop her from making mistakes. No sulking and whimpering because this is what you wanted.", "NTA - are you her husband or parent?

Reading your post, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re talking about your wife, but instead like you\u2019re talking about a young teenage daughter. Being treated like that can be extremely grating. Most of the other comments seem to brush that aside, and the attitude seems to be that if she wants to be treated like an adult she should act like one. The thing is, that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s trying to do! My guess is she\u2019s been sheltered her whole life and is only realizing as an adult how that stunted her.\n\nBeing sheltered from your mistakes makes it hard to learn from them. You mention how upset she gets when she fails. That\u2019s because she\u2019s been sheltered her whole life! Your wife is trying to learn, and to grow as a person. You are doing nothing to help her while you continue to shelter her against her will. Even before the electricity incident I would call you TA (which is where I think I differ from most top comments).\n\nLastly, regarding the electricity bill. I\u2019ve seen some other people call you out on this and you were receptive to it. The best way you can help her is to let her fail (when the fallout isn\u2019t too serious) and then support her as she deals with the fallout. Playing a game of \u201cI told you so\u201d does nothing to help her, and it makes it extremely clear that you missed the whole point of what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s not TA because she didn\u2019t blame you for not warning her about the bill, she just wanted some support which I think is fair.", "ESH.\n\nYou're infantalizing her, and she's acting like a child.

Then I can be an adult and choose to have it or not. If you simply said \u2018you won\u2019t like it\u2019 I\u2019d feel like you were treating me like a child. Same with the speeding.

She's mad because he said he knew it was going to happen, which is an AH response. How hard would it have been for him to say \"That sucks\" instead?", ">I didn't run around turning on all the lights to teach her a lesson. \n\nYou knew that it would be very expensive.
