{"id": 7660, "submission_id": "10fbad2", "title": "AITA for following my wife's request at letting her fail and let a problem bite her in the ass?", "selftext": "I try and protect her from harsh realities or things that will turn out badly.

ITS PINEAPPLE, I HATE PINEAPPLE, THERE GOES $20,\" kinda things.\n\nShe's insistent I let her fail, so she learns a lesson and stop protecting her from it. I do it because I love her, not to shelter her or keep her in a box. She gets so upset when she fails (like emo teenager curl up into a ball and sulk in the darkness vibes) and it's really hard for me to just let it happen and fight trying to rescue her. So these holidays, I let her fail. She pays the utilities for the house. She left a lot of lights on, including the tree running around the clock. I'd do what I can to negate it but never said anything. I didn't purposely run around and burn electricity to prove a point. I just didn't fuss about it when lights/TV are on in a room no one was in all the time. I'd simply turn things off and not say anything.\n\nShe just got the bill and is flabbergasted at how expensive it was. I told her I wasn't surprised because of all the electricity being used during December. Now she's mad at me for not being sympathetic for the bill she has to pay.\n\nAITA for letting this happen and not being sympathetic for the bill she's going to have to pay?\n\nTLDR:\nMy wife pays the utilities and left lights on all the time in December and got the bill and is surprised at how much it is and I wasn't sympathetic for her.\n\nAddendum:\n\n1) Sorry if it comes across as condescending. I'm very educated and it generally comes across that way, no matter how hard I try and make things neutral. The irony in that sentence is palpable, yes I hear it too.\n\n2) the bill isn't exponentially higher, it's just $80 higher than usual. It's not going to break the bank.\n\n3) I generally pay about 85% of the bills. She chose what she was able to afford and handle, as she insisted she help out with bills. Utilities are her responsibility by her choosing, I didn't just assign them to her. It's not a punishment for her behavior. It's her first time paying actual bills besides her car.\n\n4) There's no parental child kink here.

Reading your post, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re talking about your wife, but instead like you\u2019re talking about a young teenage daughter. Being treated like that can be extremely grating. Most of the other comments seem to brush that aside, and the attitude seems to be that if she wants to be treated like an adult she should act like one. The thing is, that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s trying to do! My guess is she\u2019s been sheltered her whole life and is only realizing as an adult how that stunted her.\n\nBeing sheltered from your mistakes makes it hard to learn from them. You mention how upset she gets when she fails. That\u2019s because she\u2019s been sheltered her whole life! Your wife is trying to learn, and to grow as a person. You are doing nothing to help her while you continue to shelter her against her will. Even before the electricity incident I would call you TA (which is where I think I differ from most top comments).\n\nLastly, regarding the electricity bill. I\u2019ve seen some other people call you out on this and you were receptive to it. The best way you can help her is to let her fail (when the fallout isn\u2019t too serious) and then support her as she deals with the fallout. Playing a game of \u201cI told you so\u201d does nothing to help her, and it makes it extremely clear that you missed the whole point of what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s not TA because she didn\u2019t blame you for not warning her about the bill, she just wanted some support which I think is fair.", "ESH.\n\nYou're infantalizing her, and she's acting like a child.

Then I can be an adult and choose to have it or not. If you simply said \u2018you won\u2019t like it\u2019 I\u2019d feel like you were treating me like a child. Same with the speeding.
