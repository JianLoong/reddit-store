There's no food on the island apart from tiny berries that just barely keep you from dying of hunger, and just enough rainwater to keep you from dying of thirst. You scrape by on that island for a month, every day closer to starvation. And then, one day, out of the sky, falls a big box of your least favorite food. You'd look at that food, which you'd normally refuse, as the best meal you ever had. But, once you're rescued and off that island, you definitely wouldn't want to sign up for eating only that food for the rest of your life.\n\nI'm not saying that your partner is definitely bad for you.

That\u2019s felony vandalism", "If the 70 yo dress was so precious, why was it only professionally preserved after decades?

Your sweet granny is 92 and her being alive is a blessing. Besides getting the recording of her stating your sole ownership please don\u2019t vent on her the family issues. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t deserve to vent, it\u2019s because she\u2019s 92, God bless her, and the last thing folks that age want to think of is their family in turmoil. It really affects them deeply. That said, since your mom has this whole \u201cperfect\u201d facade going I\u2019d make it common knowledge (except for granny) how messed up the dress was when you got it, and how she was stifling her laughter when you confronted her about it. That\u2019s blatant BS.   While I can understand being angry they destroyed an heirloom left to you, why are you and your sister so set on who is wearing it when they get married? Are either of you engaged? I\u2019m trying to point out that you and your sis are getting upset about wanting to wear this dress when you wed (which is fine), but as far as I know from the post no one has a wedding date, engagement, ect.  It\u2019s not worth fighting over who is wearing what to two possible weddings, I hope you understand I\u2019m not bashing you, I\u2019m trying to get you to see that you are getting upset about an event that is still years in the future. Worry about present problems. Don\u2019t stress about extra issues that may or may not even come to pass.  The dress is yours, period, end.  I don\u2019t know what legal stance you have to get your mom to pay for having it fixed, but morally I do think it\u2019s entirely on her to foot the bill. And it\u2019s your choice if your sister ever wears this dress or not. So whatever your moms thinks \u201cshould be\u201d does not matter.  It\u2019s yours.  Just an idea here, I think you should type up all this trouble you\u2019ve had getting the dress and the lengths you had to go to just to get it back, maybe add a pic before and after to show all the damage it now has. Put it up on a \u201cgo fund me\u201d page and see if you can get some help from a public appeal for fairness. Also it would totally air your mom\u2019s business and take care of her \u201cperfect\u201d image.  Who knows maybe enough people your mom knows will see it and say something that she\u2019ll feel compelled to fix it to save face. But I would never let that dress out of your possession again (other than to be fixed somewhere your mom does not know). I say this because if your mom somehow gets ahold of this dress again (maybe by offering to get it repaired), I really feel like you won\u2019t get it from her a second time. By the way I do think it\u2019s a beautiful gesture to want to honor your granny by getting married in her dress. Just don\u2019t let possible future issues bring you down, when you have more than enough to handle present day. Good luck dear. I would love to see a pic of the dress sometime.  I bet it\u2019s gorgeous.  NTA", "I would get it fixed and send her the bill", "NTA. You are not being overly dramatic. There's no justification for what she did.
