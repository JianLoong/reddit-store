There's no food on the island apart from tiny berries that just barely keep you from dying of hunger, and just enough rainwater to keep you from dying of thirst. You scrape by on that island for a month, every day closer to starvation. And then, one day, out of the sky, falls a big box of your least favorite food. You'd look at that food, which you'd normally refuse, as the best meal you ever had. But, once you're rescued and off that island, you definitely wouldn't want to sign up for eating only that food for the rest of your life.\n\nI'm not saying that your partner is definitely bad for you.

She caused thousands of dollars in damage.\n\nI get the sense either your partner is not a great human, or doesn't have a full picture of what all happened.", "[removed]", "Yes this, I would definitely sue for the damage. This is beyond vindictive. NTA", " They sound abusive and you deserve bettet.", "If the grandmother is 92 I would have a hard time seeing how her dress is worth thousands.", "How does a wedding dress get thousands of dollars worth of damage? Was it torn to shreds?", "OP is NTA but even better if OP destroys her mother's favorite item of anything to see how her ex mom likes it (Since OP was disowned)", "OP is 16 and shouldn't be marrying anybody for the time being.", "Honestly, I was going to say the same. Use what\u2019s left as embellishments for your own dress. Maybe use a plain dress for structure and use the beading/lace/material to decorate your dress. If your grandma can still write, have her hand write a message that can be scanned and then embroidered into your new dress. Save the money that you would use to use your mother and put it towards your dress. \n\nCut out people who bring you down.", "Honestly, from the way op described her mother\u2019s tone when she confronted her about the damage, my first thought was that the dry cleaner DID warn her about possible/probable damage and mom decided to do it anyway as a way to ruin the dress with plausible deniability.", "If it\u2019s thousands, it\u2019s likely above small claims. That\u2019s felony vandalism", "If the 70 yo dress was so precious, why was it only professionally preserved after decades? The dress probably has no monetary value to recover in small claims court and why would you pay to fix something that has not value. And if mom brought it to a professional dry cleaners to have it done, what did mom do wrong? Op would have had to have it cleaned anyway before it could have been worn. So unless mom purposefully ruined the dress, she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Now the rest of the story may make op not an ah, but I\u2019m not voting because we do not know what precipitated op getting thrown out in the first place.", "It really is good advice, you should 100% do these things.\n\nAnd drop your partner.  They clearly don't support you or care about things that are important to you and that is only going to get worse over time.  You may have been raised to believe that you're always the least important person in the room, but your partner should *never* let you feel that way, never mind *make* you feel that way.  The way they're refusing to back you up on this tells me that you're effectively just dating your mother.", "Also remember that her logic was that this was to be a communal dress. That means the rest of the family had a right to know that OP's mother thinks the family members can get married in a severely damaged dress!\n\n\nShe's a bully, turn the family and the law on her. NTA", "But the other person is actually right imho, I would do the same. Fully out her on social media and take legal actions against her. She doesn't just sound like a bully but highly abusive as well.\n\n\nJust for vote: NTA", "It's a lot better being on the offense instead of the defense. Instead of reacting to what is done to you, do things to her that will cause her to go on the defense. Tell the world what she did, show pictures, and let all of your family know what she destroyed. Call the police and make a report and then take her to small claims court. Make her life a living hell and then cut all contact with her.", "Is there a reason you're not taking this advice seriously?", "And then don't lend it to your sister.\nNTA", "I hope you meant to say if she doesn't cover the cost to repair it - I would definitely not let her touch the dress again, even for repairs.", "What!? lol must be a bot", "Probly referring to the cost to repair it?", "Vintage things are more expensive, not less. That's a probably 70 year old antique.", "You have a hard time believe something old and fancy is worth money? Seriously? Fucking Christ.", "If its dry clean only and she threw it in the wash that dress would be wrecked, every single inch. If it's meant to be handwashed, same issue. The material itself could be destroyed. Lacing, embroidery, beading etc are very delicate and hard to repair. Even an inexpensive wedding dress could easily cost thousands to repair.", "OP was 16 when they were kicked out. They\u2019re about 18 now (maybe 19) It was about 2 years ago she received the dress from her grandmother and was kicked out.", "Am I missing something? I didn't see anything about getting married yet just that they were in the right head space to get the dress back?! Totally agree that the partner needs kicking to the curb with how unsupportive they are being over this.", "As an aside if the dress is damaged beyond repair you might be able to find a dress maker to recreate it. You can use some of the older dress like under lace or tulle to work into the new one to have it still be special. And of course fuck your family do not share it especially with your sister because she will say it's special and not want to give it back.", "Ok depending what the limit is (talk to lawyer) my point being, she's not going to listen to OP. She will have to listen to lawsuit.", "Yes, definitely take the advice, OP.", "It sounds like OP is 16 and living with the boyfriends parents. She probably cannot drop him yet. Sounds like boyfriend is also 16...cut him a bit of slack. He is probably just parroting what he is hearing from adults and doesn't understand the situation. OPs Mom sucks and I hope OP takes her to court and makes her pay for the repairs.", "I think it meant that they should rethink their relationship with their partner because he's been saying they're being melodramatic about thousands of dollars worth of damage but not discounting the possibility of a bot", "Od =I'd", "This. Wedding dresses often have intricate details, not to mention that repairing something can be more difficult than making it in the first place. Something doesn\u2019t have to be worth a lot to be expensive to repair.", "And most likely hand made", "It could also be based on by whom or where it was made. OP talks about possibly destroying her mom\u2019s perfect reputation. I may be reading wayyy too much in to this but if they have money the provenance of the dress itself could be worth something.", "Something old and fancy and properly stored may have value, but a 60-70 yo dress That is only now being cleaned and preserved makes me question what kind of condition it was in if it gets ruined by a professional cleaning.", "Okay good catch but I still think OP doesn't sound like someone who I think should be getting married yet.", "Not the op obviously, but thank you for posting this. I want to wear my family's dress but it doesnt fit and has bad (but reasonable) damage from how many times its been worn and improper storage. I hadn't thought about having it redone and using the parts that are good in my new one. I'm sure it'll be expensive but its one of those things that always made me sad. I'm happy ti know that I can do this when I do one day get married.", "they're 18, it's been two years since she got kicked out", "She\u2019s at least 18. The wedding dress was stolen from her in 2021, so 2 years ago.", "OP is at least 18 at this point. They were 16 in 2021.", "Oh, you actually believe Mom had it professionally cleaned and that ruined it? Oh, sweet summer child.", "Not really Reddit\u2019s decision.", "Yeah I saw this suggested a few times in other dress drama threads.  It works for having people share a dress. Or using a damaged one (or sabotaged in some cases), or yeah different body type needs. The cost is high but probably cheaper than some high end new dresses.", "Even just being freshly 18 and living with others can make someone fearful of rocking the boat. She was already rejected and treated poorly by her own family. Still only makes the boyfriend only freshly 18 as well and he probably does not have the experience or maturity to see why this situation is causing so much stress to the OP. OP feelings on this matter are completely valid. This was the final middle finger from her Mom. No one else has to understand.", "No but this sub is about opinions and I also agree here"]}
