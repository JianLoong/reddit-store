If they want to hang on to Jim's stuff, not to sound insensitive, but that's *their* problem to sort out.  Their argument that it's \"good stuff you're letting be thrown away\" doesn't make sense because if it's good stuff, it can be donated to a worthy cause instead of sitting unused in storage collecting dust, probably for years on end.", "NTA\n\nHoarders are a nightmare to deal with - dead or alive.\n\nThis rubbish will never leave you if you take it in. Just because your home is not full of junk does not give them a right to fill it.", "NTA\n\nofc Paul's death is hard for his family and I have every sympathy with them.\n\nHowever they have no right to hoard their stuff in your home. They asked and you said 'no' and that is the end of it.\n\nHopefully the effect of sorting through someone elses hoarding will help them to see how much holding on to useless stuff is distorting their lives.", "NTA. If they want to keep things, they can keep them in their own homes. They don't get to make you take stuff you don't want.", "NTA. You are totally right for saying no. It's your house, why on earth would you want to pack that with random stuff", "NTA While losing someone so young unexpectedly is a tragedy, it sounds like the family just wants to move the hoard from his apartment into your home where it will remain indefinitely. People with a hoarding mentality see treasures where they're are none. Your in laws have two choices spend the next month going thru the hoard and get rid of the junk or move it to a storage facility.", "NTA.

Her rooms are full of stuff, most of it is still in boxes from the last time that we moved.\n\nIf you let them, your space will be filled with the Paul's junk that they are never going to sort thru.  Of course they think that you have plenty of space because it is not them that has to live with all of it.\n\nIf it is actually good stuff being thrown away, then suggest that they take it to a thrift store like goodwill or something like that.  Otherwise, they need to take it with them.  \n\nIf the thrift store does not work, then I think that your best bet is to hire movers to load a truck and send it to a storage unit close to Paul's parents if they cannot part with it.  But the cost of that may be more than the actual value of the stuff.\n\nAlternatively, you can move it to your house and move a couple of boxes a week to goodwill so that it does go away.  but that is a last option IMO.", "NTA \n\nThey can live their lives as they choose. If they hoard stuff until they only have a path through their homes, so be it. They can't force you to live like that too.\n\nThey have options. Get rid of some of their own stuff to make room for Paul's stuff, pay for a storage unit, give the stuff away, or toss it. None of the options include filling up your house with the stuff. In what world is a month not enough time to empty an apartment.\n\nNone of this is your problem. There are 3 other adults who need to figure it out. Stand firm and don't allow even one thing in your home. It just opens the door for more, literally.", "NTA. You and your husband have a system that works for you and keeps your home life reasonable for both of you.

And those who are hoarders are not AHs for having a problem.", "NTA tell her : \"Its called 'a storage unit at a storage place'\"", "NTA, I would think that between all of them they could pool their $ and rent a storage unit for a couple months so they can sort the good from the trash.", "NTA.

Giving the family an extra month, or two, given the circumstances, might be less stressful for them. But the clear deadline and clear agreement of what will happen to everything after that date would reduce your concern about how long you might be holding onto the items.~~\n\n~~You could even apply a limit on how much you can store, to focus their minds on getting rid of some of the the \"junk\" instead of relocating everything.~~", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
