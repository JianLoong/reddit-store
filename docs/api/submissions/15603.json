It was my great-grandfather\u2019s ring that he used to propose to my great-grandmother, and they gave it to their oldest son to propose to his wife. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always gone, until now. \n\nYou see, I inherited the ring from my dad, but I had no sons myself. I was, however, blessed with three wonderful daughters; Michelle (27), Fiona (24), and Emily (21). \n\nRecently, Michelle came to me to ask if she could use the ring to propose to her long time girlfriend Susanna (27). I hesitated, but agreed, giving her the ring as well as my blessing. \n\nLast week, Michelle proposed while they were out during a romantic dinner, and Susanna said yes! They later posted an announcement on social media which included a picture of Susanna wearing the family ring. \n\nAfter the announcement was posted, I got a message from my brother, Greg (49). He sent me a long rant that basically boiled down to *that ring belongs to my son and you disrespected the family tradition by giving the ring to a girl*. \n\nSome background on Greg and his son: Greg is my younger brother, and we never got along. It started out as a normal brotherly rivalry, but even into our 20s, he remained determined to one-up me at every turn. Greg knocked up his college girlfriend (now wife) Janice with his son Tyler when he was 20. When he proposed, he asked our dad for the ring, but our dad refused because I was older. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, Greg had assumed that since I had no sons, I\u2019d be giving Tyler the ring when he wanted to propose to his girlfriend Ashley. Greg told me to take the ring back from Michelle and Susanna, I said hell no. \n\nSince then, Janice, Greg, and Tyler have been passive-aggressively talking about me behind my back to the rest of the family, accusing me of dishonoring our family\u2019s tradition.

Your brother and his wife sat back eagerly watching your flock of daughters knowing they had no penises to propose with. Guess what? Turns out proposing is an equal opportunity gesture! Sucks for your family but the oldest son now passed the family ring onto his eldest child for a proposal. Assuming you used the ring to propose to the mother of your children, it seems your eldest would have more attachment to the ring than your brother's kid.

Passing to the son #1.\n\nThey gave it to their son to propose.  Your dad.  That's #2.\n\nYou got the ring. That's time 3. \n\nSo, no, this hasn't happened a ton of times. \n\nWhat I don't understand is, did every single woman die before the oldest son proposed?  This is weird. Why wouldn't the woman keep her engagement ring until she died?", "NTA\n\nWe are NOT living in the days of primogeniture when the estate passed in its entirety to the eldest son. Even the English monarchy revised its succession rules so the elder of whatever gender inherits the Crown on the death of the reigning monarch. If Princess Charlotte had been born first, she would be the next monarch.\n\nFWIW the laws of primogeniture inheritance arose when land was \"owned\" by the King who then allocated land to nobles in exchange for loyalty and most importantly sending men to fight when necessary. These Barons (or whatever their rank) would do the same with those below them who pledge alliance to their liege lord.\n\nIt was practical matter since with few exceptions woman did not actually lead men into battle until relatively recently.\n\nAnd again FWIW - England abolished primogeniture laws in 1925 so the entire estate doesn't pass to the eldest heir any more.\n\nWelcome to the 21st Century where women are able to inherit on equal terms with those who possess a penis. :-)", "NTA. That tradition originated from a time that the man was always the one to propose. Nowadays women can propose as well, to a man or another woman. You just modernized the tradition, welcome in 2023.\n\nNowadays all western monarchies recognize the oldest child of the monarch as the heir to the throne, regardless of gender. I don't think you can be expected to be more traditional than the King of England.", "NTA sounds like you're following the family tradition perfectly", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re well within your rights to pass this ring to your eldest child whether male, female or non-binary. Almost no heredity passes exclusively in a male-only tradition.\n\nMy only issue is what if your daughter and her GF split - will the GF keep the ring?", "NTA, don\u2019t give shit back.

But don\u2019t take any long trips and keep a close eye on your spoons. \n\nNTA", "NTA, the minute your dad gave the ring to you and you used it to propose to your wife, it was never going to go to your brother or his family.  Family traditions change over time and technically you are following tradition. Your dad gave it to you as the oldest child and you gave it to Michelle your oldest child. While I expect that you hope Michelle will give it to her oldest child be prepared if she doesn't have a child that she give it to an adopted child instead of a niece or nephew. It will always remain a cherished heirloom that is given with love. I would suggest that before you pass you write out the family history of the ring for your daughter and ask her to pass it onto the whomever she passes it onto next with her history added.", "NTA It is as simole as this you had something in your possession and then you gave to your daughter which was completely your choice", "NTA. You respected the spirit of the heirloom and tradition; gender in this point is not super relevant as it is about the oldest offspring using it to propose to a wife. Also, it sounds like this was assumed from OP\u2019s brother and never explicitly asked beforehand. You don\u2019t ask for a ring back after it was used in a proposal, that\u2019s tacky. He should have asked before.", "NTA and let them know they are not invited to wedding since they have issues and congrats", "I just love that you not only included your daughter but welcomed her fianc\u00e9e. Beautiful!", "NTA, sexist tradition is sexist. You kept the ring in the family and made your daughter very happy.", "NTA. \n\nThe truth is your ancestors were the assholes for setting up a system that passed precious keepsakes down based on factors no one can control in such an uneven way.\n\nIgnore your extended family.

It is the duty of those of us who carry traditions on to honor them while ALSO making sure that they fit with how the world is. \n\nIMO?

Why are you bringing it up about this relationship?", "I wouldn't even consider bringing that up - how would you feel if someone proposed to you, gave you a ring, and then their parent started asking about whether you'd give it back if you broke up?\n\nEvery time it's gifted with a proposal, there's the chance it will be lost to the family, and yet every time so far, it's stayed. And that's all you can hope to continue.", "It seems petty at this point. \n\nThis is a ring that someone proposes with and then post ceremony never wears again. \n\nLet your daughter use it.  Let all the people of that generation use it.  Nephew.  Your other daughters.
