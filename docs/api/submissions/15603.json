That\u2019s how it\u2019s always gone, until now. \n\nYou see, I inherited the ring from my dad, but I had no sons myself. I was, however, blessed with three wonderful daughters; Michelle (27), Fiona (24), and Emily (21). \n\nRecently, Michelle came to me to ask if she could use the ring to propose to her long time girlfriend Susanna (27). I hesitated, but agreed, giving her the ring as well as my blessing. \n\nLast week, Michelle proposed while they were out during a romantic dinner, and Susanna said yes! They later posted an announcement on social media which included a picture of Susanna wearing the family ring. \n\nAfter the announcement was posted, I got a message from my brother, Greg (49). He sent me a long rant that basically boiled down to *that ring belongs to my son and you disrespected the family tradition by giving the ring to a girl*. \n\nSome background on Greg and his son: Greg is my younger brother, and we never got along. It started out as a normal brotherly rivalry, but even into our 20s, he remained determined to one-up me at every turn. Greg knocked up his college girlfriend (now wife) Janice with his son Tyler when he was 20. When he proposed, he asked our dad for the ring, but our dad refused because I was older. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, Greg had assumed that since I had no sons, I\u2019d be giving Tyler the ring when he wanted to propose to his girlfriend Ashley. Greg told me to take the ring back from Michelle and Susanna, I said hell no. \n\nSince then, Janice, Greg, and Tyler have been passive-aggressively talking about me behind my back to the rest of the family, accusing me of dishonoring our family\u2019s tradition.

Even the English monarchy revised its succession rules so the elder of whatever gender inherits the Crown on the death of the reigning monarch. If Princess Charlotte had been born first, she would be the next monarch.\n\nFWIW the laws of primogeniture inheritance arose when land was \"owned\" by the King who then allocated land to nobles in exchange for loyalty and most importantly sending men to fight when necessary. These Barons (or whatever their rank) would do the same with those below them who pledge alliance to their liege lord.\n\nIt was practical matter since with few exceptions woman did not actually lead men into battle until relatively recently.\n\nAnd again FWIW - England abolished primogeniture laws in 1925 so the entire estate doesn't pass to the eldest male son  any more.\n\nWelcome to the 21st Century where women are able to inherit on equal terms with those who possess a penis. :-)", "NTA. That tradition originated from a time that the man was always the one to propose. Nowadays women can propose as well, to a man or another woman.

While I expect that you hope Michelle will give it to her oldest child be prepared if she doesn't have a child that she give it to an adopted child instead of a niece or nephew. It will always remain a cherished heirloom that is given with love. I would suggest that before you pass you write out the family history of the ring for your daughter and ask her to pass it onto the whomever she passes it onto next with her history added.", "NTA It is as simole as this you had something in your possession and then you gave to your daughter which was completely your choice", "NTA. You respected the spirit of the heirloom and tradition; gender in this point is not super relevant as it is about the oldest offspring using it to propose to a wife.

Just because that\u2019s never been a female before doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t be! Obvs NTA", "Greg sounds like such a treat to be around /s \n\nNTA.

Would one of the siblings expect the ring to go to the first couple who produced a grandson (assuming OP's lesbian daughter is the one to be the bio mom)? \n\nTraditions change after time. If the expectation was for OP to give the ring to the eldest nephew, their own father should have said something before OP gifted the ring to their daughter.", "The problem with that is changing tradition to fit the specific scenario you particularly wants renders tradition null and void.\n\nNot saying he was wrong yo give it to his daughter to propose but he did irrevocably break the tradition for right or wrong.\n\nExample if it is tradition to pay for a daughter's wedding but op refuses for the daughter who just proposed everyone on her would be all YTA.", "also i can't imagine it feels great to be a non-eldest child in a family with this kind of tradition", "Right?!\n\nNTA, the eldest child still got to put it on their future wife\u2019s finger.", "Depends is OP first born or first born son?\n\nI'd he is second then that ring belongs to an older sisters oldest continued on.", "What about her? She\u2019s totally on board with the decision and very proud to see Susanna wearing her ring.", "Can I ask why you think that?

Sometimes traditions need to be adapted over time to fit current circumstances, and that\u2019s ok. In this case, OP literally took the same approach as the British royal family, who\u2019s rules about succession now dictate that the throne passes to the firstborn heir no matter their gender rather than going to the first male heir. In that exact same vein, OP passed the ring to his firstborn heir rather than the first male heir in the family, who is not his direct descendant. Does modifying the rules of a tradition so it\u2019s not sexist any longer make the tradition null and void? I\u2019d personally argue not.", "What if they have kids? \n\nNTA. I'm just curious. Since ppl do divorce after they have kids. I hope your daughter and FDIL have a wonderful life together tho. I bet they really love that you gave them the ring.", "Yeah thats what it seems like to an outsider like me too. \n\nI was also wondering if he had issues with the gay marriage piece of it all. Hopefully the answer to that is no.\n\nBut you would think that if he wanted his son to have it, he would have had a conversation like this before your eldest daughter turned 27 lol.", "Oh, I guess I\u2019m not in the know about heirloom rings passed along. I thought the previous wearer had to die before it could move on. I guess you got your wife a nice new ring tho.", "Don\u2019t listen to the person you replied to. Just because it went to the first born son before doesn\u2019t mean anything. If your dad wanted Greg to have it because you didn\u2019t have sons, he would\u2019ve left it to Greg. You took a family tradition and made it better by giving it to your FIRST BORN kid. I think your dad would\u2019ve wanted it to stay in the family and you made that happen. That\u2019s the important part", "There would be two ways to approach this.\n\nEither it goes to first born son and their first born son \n\nIn advent first born doesn't have son it goes to first born son of next generation \n\nOr it goes to first born of every generation\n\nBut if it is the second op must be sure he is the first of the first of the first.\n\nYounger brother is jealous and shitty but he is not completely wrong here. \n\nOP tweaked it just enough to benefit him and his.  Which is his legal right but it does call into question the morality of it.\n\nGranted this is just my opinion and ring is already gone but younger brother has some right to be upset.  Cause let's be honest this likely isn't the first time something like this went down.", "Our family does things a little differently than most, someone on another thread interrogated me about the specifics if you\u2019re interested.", "I view it more as a deviation from tradition out of necessity (there is no eldest son) and a deviation from tradition for selfish reasons.", "There\u2019s actually a lot of ways to approach this.\n\nBut the specific tradition that had been established could no longer exist.  Anything that was to be done would be a change from the past.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to think that \u201cfirstborn son of the next generation\u201d would be the reasonable  back up option.\n\nBecause, then you\u2019d also have to go back all the generations to see if one of them had a son before the firstborn in that generation had a son.  Because then, the \u201cfirstborn\u201d thing is being privileged in some generations and not others.  Logically, you\u2019d have to go back to the original and find out who the firstborn son of all the cousins in a given generation was, and the ring would go to that person.\n\n Reality being, there\u2019s no reason that \u201cfirstborn son of the next generation of cousins of both sons and daughters in the absence of the firstborn son of this generation having a son\u201d should be the default assumption.\n\nEither it should go to the first boy in each generation regardless of parentage, because it\u2019s about a family inheritance that matters to the family \u2014 or it stopped being OPs brothers business the minute it was already passed to someone in his generation.\n\nThere\u2019s literally no reason to expect that the ring would go back up to follow a different branch of the tree\u2014because that wasn\u2019t the tradition.", "Legally speaking, engagement rings are more contracts than gifts\u2014meaning if the marriage doesn\u2019t happen for any reason it goes back to the family that if came from.  Heirloom rings are usually even protected or expected to be returned even in cases of divorce.", "Giving the ring to a son was the tradition\n\nAt this point OP is winging it.\n\nWhich is his right.\n\nBut he can never say it is traditional to hand this down to first born son.\n\nThe next sticky wicket is if daughter and girlfriend have a donor and daughter wife is the carrier.\n\nThen despite what you or I might think it is out of the bloodline.\n\nHeirlooms are always trouble", "ESH. Heirloom traditions like this are just nonsense anyways as if somehow being first born makes you the \u201cwinner\u201d for lack of a better term. Just spitballing, but personally I think it should go to whoever is the family historian/tradition keeper/some other criteria that is more meaningful than congrats on your sex and birth order. That is how you start a new family tradition.", "NTA. Traditions of a few generations are just getting started, so you can interpret them as you need. Greg has been refused once, so you know your father's feelings on the matter too.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s like how a queen comes into power; there\u2019s no sons, so the role gets passed to the eldest daughter. \n\nYou were in possession of the ring due to the tradition, and you decided what to do given your circumstance. It wasn\u2019t even a wrong decision, the fact you\u2019re passing down the heirloom still but giving it to your daughter probably means way more than giving it to your nephew ever could", "NTA your property to do with as you please.

Bad ass tradition change and great parenting", "Greg better not be invited to the wedding, he is a homophobic piece of work.", "NTA and screw Greg! Is he also upset due to this being an LGBTQ+ situation? And if so, double screw Greg!", "NTA.  Not one bit.  I also think it's wonderful you gave it to your daughter to propose to her future wife.  Well done!", " NTA", "NTA", "NTA, the ring was never your brother's to hand down. And his logic is flawed, he said 'you disrespected the family tradition by giving the ring to a girl', but technically everyone had been giving it to a girl, in matrimony.", "Your ring. NTA.", "By passing the ring to a son the intention is clearly to purpose which is what your daughter did with it therefore fulfilling the tradition NTA", "NTA.", "Your logic is flawed. The oldest son is not necessarily the oldest child.", "That\u2019s up to Michelle and Susanna, but I suspect he won\u2019t be getting an invite once there get sent out", "That\u2019s not an option, the siblings would need to continue to produce children until a son were to be born to be heir to the ring. /s", "You are Technically Correct! We'll host a summit and invite everyone to share your sage observation.", "OP says he's a guy in the comment, and I'm assuming that he's the eldest? Just going off the post he only mentions a younger brother.", "Then maybe it's time to change the tradition again, where the ring is used from proposal to marriage ceremony then passed to the next person.

That\u2019s precisely what I\u2019m referring to. As of 2015, when this officially took effect, males born after October 28th 2011 no longer take precedence over females in the line of succession. Which is exactly the approach OP decided to go with in this case.", "Both are kinda selfish, but because we like feminism and don't like people selling out their legacy, we vote differently.\n\nAnd I think the guy has a good case to give it to his daughter. But tradition draws it strength from repetition and family unity. He kinda trashed the unity part by making it about his wants rather than the family's.\n\nWhich is obviously legal. But the weight of tradition is gone. Whoever receives the ring can do what they want with it because that's what he did.", "Yes and if we use 2013 case as predicament the \"queen\" didn't decide to do this unilaterally but with consent and an act of the parliament.\n\nWith this as a precedence then all members or at very least elders of the family would get a vote.", "I'm not sure what he could have done with it that honored tradition anymore than what he ultimately did with it?", "If you want to say legally op can do whatever he wants with it 100% his choice.\n\nMorally he broke the generational agreement \n\nAgain not saying it's a bad thing but it is what occurred and pretending otherwise is deceitful at best.", "Discuss it with the family? Unless the only family this tradition matters to is him and his daughter?", "Lol no he didn\u2019t. There was no \u201cgenerational agreement,\u201d just a patriarchal tradition of the ring being passed from the eldest son to his eldest son. Which had never been an issue before because all of the previous generations had sons to directly pass it to. OP didn\u2019t have a son, and his father made it abundantly clear that he didn\u2019t want the ring going to OP\u2019s brother and his family line. So the ring went to OP\u2019s eldest daughter. His nephew was never really in line for it, and should never have assumed he was.", "What solution could they have come up with that was any better? There was literally no way to adhere to tradition.", "Then the tradition is broken.\n\nIt's not a bad thing but it isn't the tradition that dad was a part of.", "Oh it was an excellent solution. But he devalued the whole family tradition part by not confirming it with family first.\n\nIt's like the law. There are times the law is an ass, and you break it for the greater good. But you've created a precedent where anyone who dislikes a particular law can break it. \n\nObviously a law is protected by punishment or fine, so it maintains itself. But tradition gains its power from the shared beliefs of the family. \n\nIf he had consulted his family,  he could have had it updated and with the general agreement of most of them. That keeps the strength of that tradition despite being updated.\n\nMaking his own choice without them means one of two things, either he doesn't care about tradition in general, ie if his daughter decides to sell it in the future, he can't talk about how it's family tradition. Or he only values his daughter as family and they're starting a new tradition.", "The tradition meant that it was his outright. To imply that there was some sort of counsel responsibility when there is absolutely no history of it is just fabrication."]}
