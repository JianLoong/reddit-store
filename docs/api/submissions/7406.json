Afterwards we were outside having some drinks and discussing the birth itself. Lana was talking about how embarrassed she was afterwards because she'd shat herself during and how she wanted to just bury her head in the sand. Only three women in the group have had kids: Lana, one of her friends and my girlfriend. The rest hadn't and seemed quite shocked that Lana shat herself including my girlfriend. To be fair they weren't laughing directly at her in an intentionally malicious way but were still laughing in a \"you really did that?\" type of way. My girlfriend chimed in saying that she would've been surprised if Lana wasn't embarrassed after shitting all over herself then started dramatising the whole thing - jokingly- as if it were a major deal. \n\nIt was all banter but to cover all corners I added that it's actually common to shit yourself while giving birth. With all the pushing and pressure being exerted on your stomach, it's frankly only natural and a very common occurrence so she shouldn't be bothered. The friend who has a child agreed with me but one cousin was like \"yeah right\" and so i double down and used my girlfriend as an example. She also pooped during the birth. She seemingly didn't realise and we never spoke about it because it literally didn't matter to anyone. I didn't give a fuck, the nurses didn't give a fuck, the doctor absolutely didn't give a fuck. What matters is the baby came out, even if he came out with unexpected friends. My girlfriend argued with me for a bit insisting that she didn't but stopped when I told her she could ask her mother (she was also there). From then onwards she completely ignored me. Everytime I spoke to her she would simply just stare at me then continue talking to someone else. This made things a bit tense since everyone noticed so I told her that I'd wait in the car and excused myself. She followed about thirty minutes later and as soon as we got home she gave it to me. She thinks it was a dick head move blasting the fact that she shat herself to everyone like that and that it was really embarrassing and unnecessary. \n\nNo one even cared and I could tell it made Lana feel calmer but I just let her get it out and didn't say anything. Things are still quite cold and I just keep replaying this in my head wondering if I'm the asshole.

I'm a single guy without any kids and even I know that. I wouldn't be surprised if your gf already had a tendency to mock/bully her sister, and I think she suffered a narcissistic injury because you \"took\" her sister's side.", "YTA.", "You can get on the trendy band wagon and tell people how it really is and by doing so, embarrassing you gf.

It never effing happened.", "I\u2019m not too sure on this one.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have shared that sort of information so casually, but your gf was making fun of someone else for doing it, even if only in a lighthearted manner. \n\nI think it\u2019s kind of funny, actually. Everything\u2019s fine and hilarious when it\u2019s something someone else has experienced but when you point out she went through the same thing suddenly its \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201cunnecessary\u201d.\n\nEven though you probs shouldn\u2019t have told everyone about that, when considering the context, I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA. Good job sticking up for her sister though", "Yeah, OP, it\u2019s a soft YTA. It wasn\u2019t your story to share.

If someone wants out themselves, that their right.  But you never tell an embarrassing story about someone else, especially involving a very private situation like giving birth.

Granted, no one should be embarrassed of that, but read the room.\n\nEdit: I guess everyone likes a 'then everybody clapped' moment on this subreddit lol", "YTA. Ffs.

You could have told her in private she was out of line because she had also experienced that situation.", "NTA\n\nGiving birth sucks and there is so much people who haven't gone through it or seen it don't realize.

It may be \u201ccommon\u201d during childbirth but it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.  You were intentionally shaming her for something she couldn\u2019t control.  Seek therapy.

What you said was completely accurate, it is far more often than not to shit during birth. I certainly don't know anyone who hasn't. You were pointing out how rude she was being.

It is very common to poop while delivering a baby and many women don't even know they've done it because the nurses just clean it up and keep on working to deliver a baby. Your girlfriend doesn't sound like much of a catch if she can pick on a friend for something that is very natural and expected", "ESH, but you more. \n\nYour girlfriend embarrassed her sister over something her sister had chosen to tell everyone.

You\u2019re pushing for forever. Of course you might not notice- you have an array of gooey and arguably gross things coming out of you at certain points, poop will fly under the radar a lot. \n\nLana was talking about how embarrassed she was. She ended up feeling more put on the spotlight when other people butt in with their own opinions instead of just chatting with her about it. The friend group shouldn\u2019t have teased her about something she was embarrassed about. \n\nThose other women\u2026 they\u2019re either extremely ignorant to certain aspects of birth or so embarrassed by shitting (in a situation it\u2019s more normal to shit in than to not) that they would rather throw her under the bus and make her feel alone in her shame. \n\nOVER A LITERALLY NORMAL OCCURRENCE THAT NO NORMAL PERSON CARES ABOUT. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have thrown your wife under the bus in front of people- she obviously was embarrassed and clueless. But if I were you, I would\u2019ve said everything except that part about her doing it since she was obviously so appalled. HOWEVER, once we\u2019re in the car on the way home, I\u2019d be telling her she should know she did this too so she can reflect a bit on how she made a woman feel about it.  \n\nI secretly hope someone is also chatting with Lana making sure she isn\u2019t feeling embarrassed about it, and see how she feels about how she was kinda put on blast like that if its something she\u2019s insecure about. I feel for her in this situation.", "ESH - your girlfriend has to realize it's not a big deal and a majority of women poop while giving birth, but you should also know how your girlfriend would feel about revealing something like that. \n\nAlso, read the room.

Her sister was already embarrassed and your girlfriend opted to add to it. Girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have thrown stones. Pregnancy and birth are not 100% pleasant.

Yes, you're a bit of an asshole, but from the context I have taken from this, you were well-meaning. You should definitely apologise.\n\nHaving said that, your girlfriend also took the piss out of her sister for the exact same thing. If her sister was having a laugh and it was all banter, that's great, wonderful. But if your girlfriend is going to make those jokes, but then get pissy when the same things are said about her, that's kind of assholey, too. I get it, it's humiliating, but at the same time, don't be a hypocrite.\n\nI'm going to say, in this case, as far as you and your girlfriend go, you're both being dicks here, but in a minor capacity, and I don't really believe either of you are bad people. Just need a bit more communication between you two, and your girlfriend needs to not joke about stuff she cannot handle if said about her. That's only fair.", "Yeah why are these woman talking about it like teenagers. I \ud83d\udca9 with two of my three births and no one cared, the actual birth and meeting our baby was all we cared about.\n And once you are a parent you deal with so much shit everyday you don't care about such things anymore.", "Why not ESH? The gf was kinda making Lana feel bad.", "I\u2019d argue ESH.

There is usually a nurse there to discreetly remove it, so it's one less thing to be embarrassed about.\n\nThe girlfriend started dramatising the incident, which is going way too far.\n\nBoyfriend should have said something like \"ok, this is getting out of hand\" and changed the subject, rather than embarras someone else, his girlfriend. They should have left that conversation to a time they were alone.\n\nSource: My brother is an OBGYN and says it happens constantly, and the nurses try to make it as discreet as possible.

Almost all women shit themselves during a vaginal birth. I\u2019ve never, ever once seen a nurse or a doctor ever say a word to the patient when it happens. Obviously there are multilayers of chucks and what not under the patient because a helluva lot more stuff than just a baby comes out. When the poop happens we fold the Chuck over and continue on. It\u2019s not a big deal or anything we even give a second thought to at all. It\u2019s almost certain to happen. Embarrassing a woman trying to push a baby out by telling her she pooped is unprofessional and unnecessary. I\u2019ve had many women worry about it for some reason, and I tell them the same thing; it will probably happen, but also you will probably have no idea it happened.", "Wow, you're really glossing over the gf's part in all of this.

Why is this even top comment right now? What a total joke!", "Lmao if you find it UNFORGIVABLE if your partner says you pooped during childbirth, but find it TOTALLY COOL to make fun of women for pooping during childbirth, I suggest your expectations for parenthood are wildly out of step with reality.", "Exactly. This is how high schoolers behave and part of the reason why women are afraid to talk about certain health issues. The fear of being told you\u2018re weird or gross outweighs anything else and it\u2018s horribly sad, especially because the bullying pretty much always comes from other women", "WHAT?! It literally tells you every acronym on the sub's info bar?!", "I'm with you on this to an extent, but if you were humiliating people for natural, traumatic, physically exhausting and painful events, I'd probably side with your ex just because if that what you were doing you'd be wrong no matter what.", "Thanks, I thought NTA and NAH were the same", "I'd nominate FAP for Fake Ass Post", "I\u2019d say NTA. Pooping during birth is natural and is nothing yo be ashamed about. If gf was ashamed, that\u2019s on her for believing it\u2019s shameful, and shaming and bullying someone else about it. She deserves to be embarrassed for what a shitty person she was being and if she\u2019s choosing to be embarrassed over shutting during birth she\u2019s missing the point.", "Yeah I think you're NTA, OP. Perhaps you should have handled it a little bit differently, but I don't think you're wrong for setting the record straight when Lana was honestly being Ristes for something totally natural. \n\nBirth is messy, can be traumatic, painful, emotional and exhausting. It's not surprising that your girlfriend didn't remember all the details. But when she decided to embarrass Lana and make fun of her for something like that, to me, she asked for it.", "The sister didn't find it funny. Therefore not a joke. If she was genuinely joking she would have laughed when OP said she pooped too.", "I shit on my baby\u2019s face and would never have known I my husband hadn\u2019t told me.

Aren't you doing the exact same thing now that OP's GF did- exaggerating? See how easy it is to do. OP admitted it wasn't malicious...so how do you take OP's word on the fact that she was being dramatic, but not that part?", "All women do, that's what causes period pain. Some womens' uteruses are a lot more gung-ho about it, but yeah, it's the  same thing just a difference in degree.  Your uterus is pushing out the uterine lining, clots, etc instead of a baby.", "I know, it's like exercising the muscles required. But not all period-having people have it be so noticeable. Some people have much more consistent pain.", "Your friend tells you something extremely embarrassing. You don't think it's shaming them to then do a one man show dramatizing the thing your friend thinks was embarrassing?

We don't need OP to tell us if it's malicious or not because we already know this is tacky AF.", "I realized I had because one of the nurses immediately pulled out/wrapped the sheet, but I definitely couldn\u2019t discern anything at that point between an epidural & the contractions.\n\nIt\u2019s really bizarre to be mocking someone else for anything their body does during childbirth, though.", "I am glad it went well for you, and that you had good midwives helping you!", "Jesus I thought enemas went away with the 1960s.  Did they also shave your pubic region?  They used to do that too!", "Enemas were standard birthing practice in Germany - my friend delivered 2 of her kids there. She was horrified, but still felt their practices & care around pregnancy & birth were far superior than the US.\n\nBoth my labors started on a super empty stomach & were exceedingly fast so if poop happened I never noticed.", "Wow, that's really old school! I wonder why the hospital brought that procedure back.", "There's worse situations to poop yourself in. Birth is messy and sometimes gross, nothing to feel bad about.", "Yeah, I always envied those women with easy periods!  My were always horrible, and I usually passed large clots which really, really hurt a lot.  The universe made it up to me by allowing me to skip vaginal birth though, so I'm grateful for that.  I don't think I'd have been able to handle it!", "Yeah, I read the title and was all ready to be like \"of course you're an AH!\" except... why would the GF react to somebody saying something really embarrassed them by \"dramatising the whole thing - jokingly- as if it were a major deal\"? This is an AH thing to do, and I'm kinda on OP's side. If he had just reacted to the initial story by sharing that detail about his GF, I'd be like \"dude, shitty (pun intended) thing to do\", but he reacted to his GF being, as you say, tacky AF.", "Thank you. It really was like torture. Especially since he weighed 10 pounds and by the time they got around to saying that I could have an epidural, it was too late for one. But hey, the nurses didn't have to clean up any poop! \ud83d\ude44\n\nThat was in 1985 though.

If your gf knew she did it and laughed at someone who did, then in my opinion she deserves to be called out on it. But she didn\u2019t know and even if she was laughing a bit at the sister\u2019s poopage, and that\u2019s not nice, this was not the time to call her out on it.

Yes, it\u2019s a relatively common phenomena, but it\u2019s also something that you should know (As an adult) to just ignore in light of the vastly more important event that it was part of, namely the birth of your child.", "Yeah dude YTA. It\u2019s a normal side effect of removing a watermelon sized thing out of your body through a hole the size of a lemon. But obv you know nothing about the trauma the body endures growing a human let alone birthing one.", "After see the title and without reading the story I can say YTA", "I don\u2019t even need to read the post itself. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Only because you didn\u2019t discuss it with her beforehand to verify if it\u2019s funny. It is funny but only if you both agree it is.

Of course you are in the wrong. You needlessly embarrassed your girlfriend just so you could prove you're right. You don't tell people things like this.
