Their dream night was going to top tier night club without waiting in lines or spending a dime and basically being treated like models.  \n\n\nI don\u2019t think any of them have really gone out in a city with a big night life / club scene like Miami, NY, LA, the closes was Nashville and Austin which are big on night life but not so big on nightclubs. I tried my best to set expectations but in the group chat they kept posting about the most exclusive spots. And when I posted a reasonable spot, they were like eww thats cheugy.   \n \n\nI will say this I just turned 31, and despite myself being tall and skinny, on certain nights even I get turned away depending on the artist performing. And a lot of Katie\u2019s friends were on the curvier side and dressed like they live in the suburbs. \n\nI told Kate and Allie, let\u2019s have a backup plan in case we don\u2019t get in. There are tons of clubs we can guarantee to get in to, but they said no. They said that they know how to dress classy and the all be fine. \n\nWell, we went out and even got their early and things were going bad, the doorman let other groups of girls go i before us, despite them being behind us in line. And when he finally did he talk to us, he is like hey we are full from reservations but we do have a table with a min spend of $2,000 And I got that as a sign to leave.   \n \n\nBut then Katie and Allie start arguing with the doorman and are like, those other girls they didn\u2019t have reservations. And the guy is like look I am sorry but other spots are open. And then Katie starts yelling \"you let those girls\" in and starts calling him creepy. And I am pulling away like \"let's go guys, this is not worth it.\" And they start arguing more, and I am getting so embarrassed because the doorman then pull us out of the line.\n\nThen another group of girls goes to the front and they look behind at our group and start laughing with the doorman, and after this Katie starts bursting out crying. And I try to comfort Katie but she tells me to  eave.   \n \n\nWe end up going to another bar near by but the night was pretty much ruined. And afterwards Katie didn\u2019t want me to come out the next day saying that I didn\u2019t stand up to the doorman with her and Allie, and that I cared more about my self image than supporting them. And that me being silent I was supporting misogyny and objectification of women. And she started then standing in line in that spot was basically like being the Rosa Parks for women.

OPs friends may have figured because they are an 8.5+ where they live the same applied in the big city, but it doesn't and they are just another run of the mill hopeful.", "If you actually have model looks and/or a social media following.", "The bride shouldn't have paid. It's a bachelorette party thrown by her friends. IF OP wanted to guarantee admission, then she could have contacted them to see what their options were. OP didn't say her friends thought they were an 8.5, they told her \"we can dress classy\" and at no time in her post did OP say they weren't dressed classy. My post is just a suggestion, OP knew they wouldn't get it and if that was the bride's goal to get into a specific club then OP and her other friends should have researched other ways to get in because OP KNEW they weren't going to get in the club as is. I don't think OP is wrong for not defending but what was the purpose of dressing up and going when she already knew it wouldn't work which is why she tried to tell them to pick something else. She could have told the friends and they could split the price (also its' CHEAPER to book in advance than the day of so that $2000 table may have been a $500 table). OP knew they weren't getting in and I think her friends realized OP knew it when she didn't bother to even speak up", "Most NY clubs are cheaper if you book them in advance than at the door. Also if she called the club may have said if you get here by 930 you have guaranteed admission. If that's her friend, then you look into other ways to get in instead of just standing in line for hours. OP KNEW they weren't getting. IF she called and they said $500 or $1000 thats a lot less than $2k. Case in point- LIV use to have tables for $10K the day of but if you booked a week in advance you could get one for $2k.", "My friends and I are good looking but not models and we\u2019ve found promoters on tinder who have camped everything. Obviously you gotta be attractive, but it\u2019s way easier than you think. If you\u2019re above a 7 it\u2019s so able", "No lol, I have 1k followers and def not a model. I\u2019ve never paid in Vegas or NYC simply from promoters", "Read OP's post. There's only so much style and fashion can do and sounds like they weren't getting in no matter how they were dressed.", "I mean... She advised them against their plans every step of the way.

You speaking out wasn't going to change anything, of course not, but at least it would have verbally demonstrated that you were on their side, not the doorman's.  Staying silent might have been construed as silent agreement with him.\n\nBut I also understand your embarrassment.  I'm under no illusion about my looks - I'm pretty much a troll - and I NEVER would even attempt to enter a nightclub like that.  It's just asking to get rejected, and me yelling at the doorman will just humiliate myself further.\n\nSo I can't really give you a judgement, because I understand both sides.  Although - your friends should have understood your boundaries, and not tried to make you feel bad that you were embarrassed more than them.  So I guess I'll end up with NTA after all.", "NTA. Tell them to watch the video for Ode to the Bouncer.", "NTA wtf does Cheugy mean?", "NTA They refused to listen to you from the beginning, and these were your stomping grounds, and you know how things work. It is their fault for being obstinate. Making a scene in front of the club was not going to change anything. They need to learn that life isn't fair, and you can not force people to treat you fairly.\n\nNone of this is your fault. They are accepting no blame for their part in this mess.

You tried to temper expectations and they didn\u2019t listen. Bouncers don\u2019t gaf if it\u2019s your birthday, bachelorette, etc. \n\nYears ago I was in Miami for a bachelorette party and it was unfortunately scheduled during swim week. So we normal looking women were literally competing against swimsuit models to get into clubs. And two of the people in our group had nothing really fancier than flip flops and shorts. We spent way too much time standing in lines and the bride to be flipping out at bouncers, which never gets you in anywhere. It was easily one of the worst trips I\u2019ve ever been on.", "NTA tell your friend she needs to stop being Sheldon", "YTA - the superiority and distain you express for the rest of the group oozes out of you on the page and probably even worse in person.  \n\nYOU'RE the one comparing Katie to Rosa Parks in trying to stick up for herself (meaning the ignorant one is YOU not her). \n\nYou find it important to talk about how DIFFERENT you look from the group (being \"tall and skinny\" vs \"on the curvier side and dressed like they live in the suburbs\" - such a dickish comment).\n\nYou convey how ELITE you think you are (saying \"on certain nights *EVEN I* get turned away\").\n\nAnd you make sure you sound like the COOL GIRL (you don't say the doorman & co laughed at \"us\", you say they laughed at \"our group\", i.e. the others) \n\nI get being frustrated by the ridiculousness of bachelorette parties and people with unrealistic plans, but your attitude towards the rest of the group is unmistakeably ASSHOLE-ISH.", "Stand up to the doorman?

It's a nightclub and we all know how the show and dance works. The ladies wanted to go to an _exclusive_ club - aka a club that discriminates and only lets in a select few. If the ladies had been let in, they would have cared zero about the club's policies. Sadly, they got their feelings hurt. \n\nThe club's target demo is young, with a certain aesthetic and that is the look that they go for when letting people in. If you don't look the part or don't have connections, you have to pay to play. Argue all you want, but you will only look like a fool as the teenagers and early 20-somethings pass you by.

The ladies wanted to go to an \"exclusive\" club because they wanted to feel like they were able to experience something that others couldn't. They liked that the club turned people away - they just didn't think that they would also get turned away. And, like you said - you can argue with the doorman all you want. They deal with beligerant and entitled people daily. You will just look like a fool.", "I realized I hit \"old\" by NYC standards when I couldn't just walk up and get in any longer. Then I remembered that scene from Knocked Up \"you're just a doorman, doorman!\" and it hit way too close. \nI think it's hilarious now and who wants to pay $25 for a vodka soda anyways?!", "I like NYC, granted I live in a nice area. But, Los Angeles always felt way more sketch.  When I lived in SoCal, I preferred to party in Newport or Huntington Beach. \nI agree OP should have been more blunt.

This is the dumbest comparison I\u2019ve ever seen.", "Someone brought up Rosa Parks at a school board meeting when schools were reopening during the pandemic. The person was arguing about their child having to wear a mask at school and compared that to Rosa Parks somehow. It was mental gymnastics. I don't think people understand who Rosa Parks was or the very real struggles she faced. It honestly pissed me off - don't compare your petty, trivial, temporary problems to the systematic racism that Rosa Parks experienced every day.", "Yuuup, I mean that's what it really sounds like with her entitlement. Like she wanted to get let in even though she wasn't following the basic dress code entirely because she was a bride.", "Exactly. For an \"exclusive\" club, $2k is actually on the cheaper side.", "Tbf all cities are like that to some extent. I lived in Portland and felt the same way sometimes (not as much with the clubbing aspect you could usually get into any bar there one way or another, but more so with the druggie unsafe side). But NYC idk how to put it, it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s a bigger city. \n\nAnyways like most places theirs plenty of safe ish areas and there\u2019s plenty of bars, roof top bars and nice bars that ARENT like this. There\u2019s just a lot more that ARE like that, if you aren\u2019t from there and don\u2019t really know better.", "Sounds like not looking like a model is the least of Katie's problems; she might want to choose her words more carefully in the future so as not to broadcast her ignorance.", "That's true. I tend to stay in Manhattan, Soho, East Village, and I'm either with my husband or a group of friends. I feel Nashville, Vegas,  and Miami are pretty \"safe\" party cities. But, I also don't get sloppy drunk. I don't miss CA, but I miss the vibe of Newport, Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach. But, you're right every place has its issues. I've felt extremely safe in Japan and Korea, but the level of extreme public drunkenness is insane there.", "Yeah, OP and the other girls could have pitched in to give the Bride to Be the illusion she was interested in.", "But it sounded like no one wanted to pitch in. Katie probably told her friends already they can get in for free and already set that expectation.", "I don't think Katie said that though?

I know what you mean though, and it was weird because I did feel really safe there. I was stared at a good bit though, since Im pasty white and had platinum blonde hair. I got quite a few compliments though and asked how I got my hair so white and what my skincare routine was, it was cool haha\n\nEdit: why did I get downvoted?? Was it the compliment thing?? I wasn\u2019t trying to be weird, they just have a big thing about \u201cporcelain\u201d skin and I was was from the PNW so I never got any sun.

But OP was hosting this event, so if she was really concerned she would have stepped out of the host position or given them examples of the best dress code from socialite pages, etc.", "It's not about beauty \"standards\". You can be beautiful in a tiara!\n\nBut that's not the type of image that gets you comped at a bar with $2000 tables.\n\nOP knew her \"friends\" were expecting her to help them get into this place, so IMO she should have helped them have an idea of the dress code. The fact that OP pops up an answer about dress code as \"she was wearing a tiara\" like that's regular attire for high end clubs makes me think she should have done due diligence for her own sake.\n\nI certainly wouldn't have participated at all, but yeah, OP is supposedly helping to *plan* the event so, yes, it is Actually her Responsibility. She's hosting!! She's not just a participant.", "Yes, very safe! I never felt in danger,  but drinking culture,  especially for salary men, is intense. My late husband was Japanese,  and it is a fantastic place to visit, but I would never live there.", "I don't think we read the same post? Her friends seemed pretty confident they would be able to get in, despite OPs warnings.  Also the beauty standards comment was about more than a tiara...  Like she's just going to transform a bunch of girls from Ohio into NYC 10s while they predrink at her place? Pls.", "Really the post where OP says *I tried to manage their expectations and suggested other clubs as alternatives when this one didn't work out* That's the one I didn't read? \n\nWell isn't that a pisser.\n\nThe whole point is she should have been sharing clubbing pictures to the group chat for weeks before the event.\n\nBut the whole thing was doomed from the start. Idk why OP participated. She's better off without those \"friends\" anyhow IMO."]}
