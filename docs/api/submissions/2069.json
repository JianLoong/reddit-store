Their dream night was going to top tier night club without waiting in lines or spending a dime and basically being treated like models.  \n\n\nI don\u2019t think any of them have really gone out in a city with a big night life / club scene like Miami, NY, LA, the closes was Nashville and Austin which are big on night life but not so big on nightclubs. I tried my best to set expectations but in the group chat they kept posting about the most exclusive spots. And when I posted a reasonable spot, they were like eww thats cheugy.   \n \n\nI will say this I just turned 31, and despite myself being tall and skinny, on certain nights even I get turned away depending on the artist performing. And a lot of Katie\u2019s friends were on the curvier side and dressed like they live in the suburbs. \n\nI told Kate and Allie, let\u2019s have a backup plan in case we don\u2019t get in. There are tons of clubs we can guarantee to get in to, but they said no. They said that they know how to dress classy and the all be fine. \n\nWell, we went out and even got their early and things were going bad, the doorman let other groups of girls go i before us, despite them being behind us in line. And when he finally did he talk to us, he is like hey we are full from reservations but we do have a table with a min spend of $2,000 And I got that as a sign to leave.   \n \n\nBut then Katie and Allie start arguing with the doorman and are like, those other girls they didn\u2019t have reservations. And the guy is like look I am sorry but other spots are open. And then Katie starts yelling \"you let those girls\" in and starts calling him creepy. And I am pulling away like \"let's go guys, this is not worth it.\" And they start arguing more, and I am getting so embarrassed because the doorman then pull us out of the line.\n\nThen another group of girls goes to the front and they look behind at our group and start laughing with the doorman, and after this Katie starts bursting out crying. And I try to comfort Katie but she tells me to  eave.   \n \n\nWe end up going to another bar near by but the night was pretty much ruined. And afterwards Katie didn\u2019t want me to come out the next day saying that I didn\u2019t stand up to the doorman with her and Allie, and that I cared more about my self image than supporting them. And that me being silent I was supporting misogyny and objectification of women. And she started then standing in line in that spot was basically like being the Rosa Parks for women. And I was like look, I have been going out in NY for 9 years, you weren\u2019t going to change anything.

And when I posted a reasonable spot, they were like eww thats cheugy.", "There's no \"unfortunately\" - the entire reason some clubs are seem as more exclusive and better is precisely because they *don't* let in groups like this one for free and only let the model looking girls in.", "OP specifies in the post that the bride to be didn't want to spend any money and assumed they were good looking enough to be one of the people let in for free. She was wrong.\n\nThese clubs want 2 kinds of people, those with very large bank accounts who will drop 1,000s to 10s of thousands on drinks and service, and people who are NY/LA 8.5+/10 out of 10. OPs friends may have figured because they are an 8.5+ where they live the same applied in the big city, but it doesn't and they are just another run of the mill hopeful.", "If you actually have model looks and/or a social media following.", "The bride shouldn't have paid. It's a bachelorette party thrown by her friends. IF OP wanted to guarantee admission, then she could have contacted them to see what their options were. OP didn't say her friends thought they were an 8.5, they told her \"we can dress classy\" and at no time in her post did OP say they weren't dressed classy. My post is just a suggestion, OP knew they wouldn't get it and if that was the bride's goal to get into a specific club then OP and her other friends should have researched other ways to get in because OP KNEW they weren't going to get in the club as is. I don't think OP is wrong for not defending but what was the purpose of dressing up and going when she already knew it wouldn't work which is why she tried to tell them to pick something else. She could have told the friends and they could split the price (also its' CHEAPER to book in advance than the day of so that $2000 table may have been a $500 table). OP knew they weren't getting in and I think her friends realized OP knew it when she didn't bother to even speak up", "Most NY clubs are cheaper if you book them in advance than at the door. Also if she called the club may have said if you get here by 930 you have guaranteed admission. If that's her friend, then you look into other ways to get in instead of just standing in line for hours. OP KNEW they weren't getting. IF she called and they said $500 or $1000 thats a lot less than $2k. Case in point- LIV use to have tables for $10K the day of but if you booked a week in advance you could get one for $2k.", "My friends and I are good looking but not models and we\u2019ve found promoters on tinder who have camped everything. Obviously you gotta be attractive, but it\u2019s way easier than you think. If you\u2019re above a 7 it\u2019s so able", "No lol, I have 1k followers and def not a model. I\u2019ve never paid in Vegas or NYC simply from promoters", "Read OP's post. There's only so much style and fashion can do and sounds like they weren't getting in no matter how they were dressed.", "I mean... She advised them against their plans every step of the way.  Her friends are capable of making their own bad fashion choices, it's not upto OP to \"let her\" wear anything.   Like it was OP's responsibility to educate a group of women on beauty standards too?  What a weird comment."]}
