(he wanted us to buy a $2,000 table)", "selftext": " One of my good friends Katie decided to have her bachelorette party in NYC (I live here) and wanted me to work with Allie (her bridesmaid) to help plan the trip.  \n \n\nI was honored to help plan, but very early on I realized that Allie and Katie had grand expectations. Their dream night was going to top tier night club without waiting in lines or spending a dime and basically being treated like models.  \n\n\nI don\u2019t think any of them have really gone out in a city with a big night life / club scene like Miami, NY, LA, the closes was Nashville and Austin which are big on night life but not so big on nightclubs. I tried my best to set expectations but in the group chat they kept posting about the most exclusive spots. And when I posted a reasonable spot, they were like eww thats cheugy.   \n \n\nI will say this I just turned 31, and despite myself being tall and skinny, on certain nights even I get turned away depending on the artist performing. And a lot of Katie\u2019s friends were on the curvier side and dressed like they live in the suburbs. \n\nI told Kate and Allie, let\u2019s have a backup plan in case we don\u2019t get in. There are tons of clubs we can guarantee to get in to, but they said no. They said that they know how to dress classy and the all be fine. \n\nWell, we went out and even got their early and things were going bad, the doorman let other groups of girls go i before us, despite them being behind us in line. And when he finally did he talk to us, he is like hey we are full from reservations but we do have a table with a min spend of $2,000 And I got that as a sign to leave.   \n \n\nBut then Katie and Allie start arguing with the doorman and are like, those other girls they didn\u2019t have reservations. And the guy is like look I am sorry but other spots are open. And then Katie starts yelling \"you let those girls\" in and starts calling him creepy. And I am pulling away like \"let's go guys, this is not worth it.\" And they start arguing more, and I am getting so embarrassed because the doorman then pull us out of the line.\n\nThen another group of girls goes to the front and they look behind at our group and start laughing with the doorman, and after this Katie starts bursting out crying. And I try to comfort Katie but she tells me to  eave.   \n \n\nWe end up going to another bar near by but the night was pretty much ruined. And afterwards Katie didn\u2019t want me to come out the next day saying that I didn\u2019t stand up to the doorman with her and Allie, and that I cared more about my self image than supporting them. And that me being silent I was supporting misogyny and objectification of women. And she started then standing in line in that spot was basically like being the Rosa Parks for women. And I was like look, I have been going out in NY for 9 years, you weren\u2019t going to change anything.
