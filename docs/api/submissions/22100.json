Quick question, if the roles were reversed and you were parking in someone else\u2019s spot, they\u2019d likely have your vehicle towed as well yeah? \n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty about it at all, they knew that was a reserved parking space when they chose to park in it.", "NTA You pay for it, you get to use it.  \nWhat would you say if someone just takes the order you paid for at an restaurant?", "NTA TOW THAT CAR!", "NTA. everyone knows the risk of parking in a reserved spot is that your ass might get towed. you paid for that spot.", "NTA\n\nYou paid for it you should be entitled to it.\n\nThere's a world where you leave a note on the car windshield saying if you see them parked again in your spot you will be forced to have them towed as a warning. But either is fine IMO.", "NTA.  You are paying for that spot, so don't feel bad it has to be cleared when necessary.", "NTA\n\nIt's your Reserved spot that You pay for.", "NTA.\nYou are a LEGEND \nI'm so glad they offered to have it towed, and that you were cool with that. \nAnyone who complains about this is clearly the type of ah who feels entitled to things that aren't theirs.", "NTA, I'd tow someone out of my driveway.", "NTA, you pay for the spot you park there, and anyone else who does needs your ok. Tell your friends your just going to crash at there place, and you're not going to pay rent, then when they object point out they are overreacting.", "NTA - You park in a spot marked reserved and you know you are rolling the dice.  I have a driveway at my house.  You can bet your bottom dollar that is someone I don't know is parked there, I am having them towed.", "NTA 100%.", "NTA. Not at all.  Someone who thinks they are entitled probably noticed your car was gone for a few days and thought they could take advantage.", "NTA, I detest entitled people, it was wrong that you had to insist on the towing.", "NTA - if you park in a spot that is clearly marked RESERVED and you know you didn't reserve it, you should expect to get towed. At the bare minimum, you should know it's a roll of the dice as to whether or not it will be towed before you get back.", "My only question for you is why did you waot 8 hours?  \nNTA. \nThe entitled person who parked in a reserve spot is the AH here.", "NTA. If I know I'm making a quick stop and don't have change, I might not pay the meter. If I come out and see a ticket on my windshield, I'm frustrated but hey, I knew the potential consequences were and I was rolling the dice and this time I got called on it.", "NTA, but my fear would be retaliation for having it towed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I grew up near a college campus, and if you parked anywhere that you weren\u2019t 100% certain was ok, 9 times out of 10 you would come back to see your car had been towed.

You pay for it therefore it is yours to use as you see fit. \n\nNot why why your complex thinks booting it would have been a good solution. All that means is the car is stuck there. The correct course of action to to tow a vehicle that is taking up a spot that is for someone else\u2019s use.", "Plenty of business and places with private reserved parking have simple signs that state \"Parking for such place and/or person only.

Based on your post it's been more than 8 hours since you got home and found the car in your spot. They had time to move the car. The spots are reserved do they already know they are taking the risk and haven't moved the car.", "I was a live in super for 21 years at a 60 unit complex.  when I started the parking was a wild west show.\nall signs, lines ignored by tenant visitors. management gave me permission to tow any violators as they were \ntired of complaints. It only took 2 cars towed in one week to end it. 1 tenant moved out, a few thanked me. \nnever an issue again", "That\u2019s how I see it.
