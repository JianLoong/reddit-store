Your career is far more important, and her child is not your responsibility. You've been very kind in the past but your life is ramping up now... that's more than acceptable and she's going to have to relax. You're setting boundaries, and she has to understand you're not her nanny. She's also an asshole for showing up at an important dinner for you, leaving the child and not taking a shred of accountability or seriousness when you threatened to leave the child in the first place. You DID warn her.\n\n**You** are the asshole for leaving an innocent child in a house alone. The amount of shit that could go wrong is immense.

There were other options, even if in the moment it didn't feel that way... this was the wrong choice.", "ESH - she shouldn\u2019t have left the kid but you had other options. Police. Fire station.

You have a life and she should respect that.\n\n3)Dropping the kid off when you had already told her you couldn't watch him was a bitch move and shouldn't have even been entertained.\n\n4)You never should've opened the door\n\n5)Leaving a child alone, especially one that's five years old and probably believes that there is actual cotton candy in the walls is negligent and dangerous. You put that child in unnecessary danger, and should be in jail. \n\n6)Her not leaving work immediately could be a sign that she, as she had previously stated, literally couldn't have gotten away from work, that there was no way to reschedule and that she desperately needed your help, and you left her child alone.\n\n7)Just because you prioritized your career and education over a personal life doesn't make her having a child any less of a valid life goal. \n\n8)It seems like her and her husband are truly trying to do better for their child, so why would you act so brashly?\n\n9)You have potentially ruined this friendship.\n\n10)You both are colossal assholes \n\n\nFinal vote ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not hers, not her problem or responsibility.  Harsh words I know, spoken to me in the past few years but it is what it is. Our children ARE our responsibility.", "I can definitely see that point of view but once someone is in the system (even just a single report) it can cause a lot of problems, I would say this counts as entitled mom's *one* warning but I certainly don't fault anyone who says E S H because I can see both sides of that. \n\nAlso the authorities would have probably considered this a non emergency call and made OP late to/miss their thing which would've defeated the whole purpose of not watching the kid in the first place.", "Maybe OP didn't realise it was an option. I only saw that it was in other comments and posts.", "I'm dumbfounded by the 'I just put food down and locked the kid in'.  \nIt's.... not an animal...... it's a child. Blows my mind.", "No I think there could be some issue. Especially being roommates and someone who does babysit sometimes. Not saying they deserved to be dumped on, but as someone who lives with and sometimes cares for the kid, there should be a reasonable expectation that they would at least make sure the kid was safe at a police station. I know in my state you have to be 10 or 11 I think to be home alone", "An argument could be made that she left a 5 yo home alone and at risk, regardless of whether mom should have left him there.", "I love that this sub is so hung up on what's legally right, rather than what's morally/ethically right.\n\nMajority of us learn that legality doesn't equal morality when we're very young.", "that's exactly what I mean both are fucked", "Depends on the jurisdiction, I guess. There are states where you can and where you can't, but usually the way the law is written concers the parents or legal guardians, or even in locum parentis like babysitter, not bystanders, and from the legal prospective that's what OP is, just a random bystander. It's like when you see a 5 y.o. on the street on their own, you won't be persecuted if you don't  start looking after the kid.", "Morally it's also not right to lock a 5 year old up, leave them alone, and not tell anyone anything other than \"I told you I don't want kids, don't call me.\"", "And morality doesn't equal legality when you are getting sued. \"Criminals\" refers to somebody who'd be convicted in court. I was never arguing that the morally right course of action would be to leave the kid at a police station, not home alone.", "Would 100% be child abandonment and endangerment here as OP went out of the way to take the child to another house and lock them in it.\n\nEditing to add: It would at the very minimum be child endangerment most places because OP make a calculated set of decisions to endanger the child regardless of whether or not they are intelligent enough to realise it would endanger the child."]}
