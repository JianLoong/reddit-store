When I was 7 I walked in on our dad kissing a woman who wasn't my mom. I was shocked, confused, and felt sick in that very same moment and started to cry. The woman ran away while my dad tried to get me to calm down and convince me that I didn't see what I saw. I was naive but not dumb and while I couldn't fully understand what was happening I knew that my mom (51f) would be upset. \n\nMy mom was out of town when this happened and my dad spent the rest of her trip to try and convince to not say a word. The only reason why I started to go through with it was because Tom came to me and said that it was better to keep quiet to spare our mom's feelings. I didn't say a word when mom came back but I had a hard time being around her as well as trying to eat. My mom was worried that I was sick but my dad brushed her off. I held in the secret for about three days and then had a break down at school when my teacher was going over the importance of honesty.\n\nMy mom came to the school and I ended up telling her everything in tears. My mom held me and told me that it was okay and that nothing was my fault. My mom confronted my dad and during the divorce it came out that Tom knew for at least a year but never said anything. Our parents ended up needing to sell the house and Tom started to lash out at me, and that's when I think something in my mom finally snapped. She didn't fight over custody for Tom the way that she did for me and ended up with 50/50 with him while primary for me. \n\nOver the years my mom would still talk to Tom and try to put in the effort to have a relationship with him but it wasn't the same as with me. When asked she would say that teen boys don't need their moms as much as younger ones do so I would get most of her attention and care. One day I straight up asked my mom why she interacted with Tom differently than me (now that I was older too) and she confessed that she was hurt at how Tom was willing to not only say nothing about my dad's affair but also covered for him once before too. \n\nMy mom admitted that while she still loved Tom she just didn't have it in her heart to fully trust him again, and preferred to keep her distance in case he ever disappointed her again. I can admit that it was sad to hear but I could also understand it. Recently Tom has been going on rants about how my mom played favorites and I told him that it was his own fault for being more loyal to our cheating dad than to our mom who was wronged. Tom has went VLC with me since and my dad called me A but his opinion on this means nothing to me so AITA?", "created_utc": 1684043294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h3xhu/aita_telling_my_brother_that_its_his_own_fault/", "score": 552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad is TA. Tom isn't. He was young and under the same pressure as you. A great responsibility was placed on him at the age of 13. In his mind, he was keeping the family together. Your dad is an ass for putting that pressure on him, and later on you. Your mom was hurt, understadably so, but you all needed counseling in that situation.", "NTA. Look your brother, intentionally on not, was part of your father\u2019s betrayal of his wife and family. So he was part of his mother\u2019s heartbreak. It must have been incredibly difficult for her and I could understand some of her resentment as well and I assume some of your own.\n\nThat being said, perhaps it\u2019s time to have a sit down with your mum and talk to her about all this and how it has affected your relationship with your brother. Perhaps you can get some family counselling (don\u2019t include your dad) to help you all air out everything you need to say and get some help to deal with all this.", "NTA...you did the right thing telling you mom. I cannot understand why he would mind not telling her. She is right to feel hurt and betrayed from her son. Because both the most important men in her life lied to her for so long. I can understand why your brother feels that way. He don't have the relationship that he wants with your mom and this is hurting him. I believe that he knows his mistake but he has to do something to earn your moms trust back", "Nta\n\nFrom your brothers perspective, he was a kid who did an awful thing, and his mom revoked her love over it, reinforcing why he was right to do what he did. I'd be curious what is going through his head under the anger.\n\nHe was a kid, and a trusted figure told him it was for the best. It was wrong of him to do it, but we shouldn't be punished for mistakes we made as children.", "NTA.\n\nYou told the truth.  Both then and now.  Tom may have been a kid at the time, but even then he had to know that keeping that sort of a secret would have serious back blast if it was ever discovered.  It was discovered, his relationship with his mom was destroyed, and its safe to say it will never be repaired.... But none of that is your fault.\n\nThe only asshole here is your dad.", "Your NtA but your dad AND your mum BOTH are. Your dad is TAH for putting that burden on a child. He used his position of \"power\" to manipulate a child into keeping a secret and your mum is the AH for punishing a child for doing what a parent asked him to do and not realising that he was let down too. Your mum is pissed at the wrong person. This isn't Tom's fault at all. He was a child,he didn't know any different and she essentially said \"f\" you and gave up on him. Can you honestly not see how wrong that was? It's not your brother's fault he isn't close to your mum, it's your mum's fault for punishing a child for something his dad did!", "NTA\n\nYou just told your adult brother the truth. That's it.  You are not responsible for his relationships with both parents. \n\nYes,  back then Tom was a kid, but so were you, and he has been lashing out at you for everything bad which happened in his life. On you, his little  brother.\n\nBehaving  like that for a teen is bad but forgivable, but for a young adult when he is almost 30 - nah, he needs therapy. \n\nHe also had more than enough time to figure out why the person he'd been lying to for at least a year and his \"scapegoat\" are closer to each other than to him. This is not a rocket science.", "YTA for saying that, and your mom is an enormous AH.\n\nTeenage boys do need their mothers, and they need their mothers' to not blame them for things that aren't their fault. \n\nYour dad is the one who cheated. Your brother was a teenager, under the influence and manipulation of his father. You know, the person he's been taught to trust, respect and obey his whole life. \n\nHe was convinced that if he told his mother, the family would break apart and she'd blame him and - oh, what do you know, she did just that. Because instead of being a *parent*, she decided to be an AH who blamed a child for her partner's actions.\n\nAnd it sounds like your mom has been manipulating your view and perspective on things. Just like your father did to your brother, all those years ago.", "YTA\n\nYour brother was just a kid, 13-14 years old, when this happened.  And it isn't as if they have a class in school teaching \"what to do if you catch one of your parents cheating on the other.\"\n\nYour brother probably looked to your father for guidance, a the adult on the spot when he discovered this, and your father probably convinced him that your mother would be upset if she learned the truth.  (Not untrue, just manipulative.)\n\nYour brother was old enough at the time of the divorce that the court would listen to his preferences about custody, while you were young enough that the court would pay less attention to you. 50/50 custody for a teenager seems reasonable - cheating generally does not affect custody issues.  I'm actually wondering more if your mother used fighting over your custody as a way to punish your father, separating you from him.  How much time did you actually spend with him after the divorce, growing up?  Were you able to develop/maintain a healthy relationship with your father?\n\nIf your mother was upset with your brother, a child caught in an impossible situation he was naturally unprepared to deal with, she should have sought guidance from a social worker or therapist on managing her own feelings without blaming a child, and guidance on how to be supportive of your brother, as a parent, despite her hurt feelings. \n\nYour father is to blame for his actions. Not your brother.  That includes any manipulation of your brother your father engaged in to get your brother to do what your father wanted.", "Your mom is a huge AH. She seems to blame your brother for not wanting his family to fall apart based on your father's bad decisions. And is still blaming him more than a decade later. He was not responsible and he should not have been put in the position to tell or not tell your mom anything. She can't understand that. \n\nYTA for telling him this is about loyalty. It isn't. It is about playing favorites. You 'ratted\" out your dad so your mom loves and cares more about you. Your brother tried to spare her feelings and keep the family together so it is all his fault and he is untrustworthy in your mom's eyes for something he kept a secret as a young teen.", "Why would the opinion of a reddit sub mean more than yr family\u2019s \n\nYTA. Your brother was a kid. It\u2019s probably best you stay low contact if you can\u2019t empathize with each other tbh", "So your brother at 13-14.  Tried to say nothing and keep his family together \n\nYou told the hard truth \n\nYour dads an AH for what he pulled \nyour mother also is for her treatment of Tom whilst favouring you\n\nAnd also you suck for your treatment to your brother and mental hurting him", "NTA. I don't know where are you from but in my country 14 year olds are considered to be mature. When I was 14 I went to highschool in a different city (using public transport to get there and lived in a student hostel) and saw my parents only on the weekends and school breaks. I managed my life on my own, handled my finances and all in all was a mini adult.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that he was not a child. At 14 he shouldn't be so easily manipulated like you at 7 so it was kind of a decision of him to not tell it to your mom and I can totally understand that it hurt your mum.\nSo if this is the reason why your mother keeps distance with him you are NTA for stating facts. \n\nHowever I think your mother is a huge one for letting her son go. Even if she was angry with him and even if he bullied you she should have fight for him, went to therapy together and with time forgive him. Your brother can be blamed for what he did at 14 but shouldn't suffer its consequences for the rest of his life.", "NTA. Your brother is facing the consequences of his actions. Now I understand that he was still a child when this happened. However, as an adult he should had apologize to your mom about his actions. He knows he is in the wrong. Only he can change the relationship he has with his mom.", "NTA\n\nTom maybe didn't know better back then, but now he does. He had plenty of time to apologize and try to form a relationship again, but he didn't", "Info- has your brother ever apologized to your mother for helping your father hide his cheating?\nI think this is a case of justified asshole. What you said was crappy but it wasn\u2019t wrong and off your brother had never apologized to your mom then you are all the more justified for pointing out his nonsense.", "Pretty sure your brother just posted his side of things", "Acronym Definition\nVLCVideoLAN Client   VLCVariable Length Coding   VLCViva la Cultura\u00a0(Spanish: Live the Culture)   VLCVirtual Language Classroom   VLCVirtual Logistics Communications   VLCVirtual Line Card   VLCVideo Lan Client   VLCVirtual Learning Center   VLCVirtual Language Center   VLCVictorious Life Church\u00a0(various locations)   VLCVirtual Learning Commons\u00a0(various schools)   VLCValley Library Consortium\u00a0(Saginaw, MI)   VLCVery Low Cost   VLCVisible Light Communications   VLCValley Leisure Centre\u00a0(UK)   VLCVolume Level Control\u00a0(sound systems)   VLCVirgin Life Care   VLCVery Large Cone   VLCVietnamese Language and Culture   VLCVery-Low Confidence   VLCVisible Light Cured\u00a0(Composite Resins)   VLCVisual Logic Controller   VLCVancouver Language Centre\u00a0(Mexico)   .....\nThere is more and more and not one that make sense in your sentence.\n\n\nAnyway. ESH, except your brother. First one is your dad, ofc. Second is your mother, for keeping grudges so long on her own child. Last is you. \n\nYeah, big applause on you for standing up for the truth, but you may not have done it if for the school teaching that day. Your mother and you failed to consider that your brother just felt in the same manipulation that your father tried to put on you. And as a child/teen at this time it is not his fault. He didn't choose between two loyalty, he followed what he has been told to do and to say.\n\nYou could have explained your mother's point of view and feelings to your brother without putting the fault on him, just stating that she indeed had a trust issue since then.\n\nYour mother is an AH to put on her son the resentment that she should have aimed uniquely to your father for having an affair AND trying to manipulate both child and so hurting their mental balance in the process. \n\nYou had so much difficulties during three day..., did anyone wonder how he was feeling, having to keep that secret for a whole year ?!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The brother was a kid and should not have been burdened with these decisions, must less punished for them.\n\nIt sounds like your mum has been awful to him for not handling it right.\n\nPeople need to stop expecting children to make adult decisions in situations they are not ready for.", "His mother should apologize to him for pushing him away and not being a good parent. He was 13. He was not equipped to make adult decisions and holds no responsibility for either of his parents actions.", "He was 13. Just as the OP described how the father manipulated him to stay silent, I have no doubt that he manipulated the older brother into staying silent too. He was probably convinced that he was doing the right thing. The mom punished him for doing what he was told to do by an authority figure. Are you seriously suggesting that the older brother should apologize for his actions as a 13 year old?", "I read that one too but it's the exact opposite of this one. This one, the younger brother knew and didn't keep it a secret while in the other one, the younger brother  kept it a secret and had a bad relationship with his mother.", "By VLC, I suspect OP meant \"very low contact\" which does make sense, given the conflict and the way the kids have been manipulated into blaming each other for their parents' bad choices and mistakes.", "VLC = very low contact I imagine", "Hard to expect someone to be a mature adult when their mother in a sense abandons him at such a young age", "The mother pushed him away. Of course, he's distant from her. What parent does that to a child? She pushed him away because he did what he thought was protecting her and their family. You don't hold your children accountable for what they did as a child. These parents made huge mistakes. Op and brother suffered the worst of the consequences. The brother doesn't deserve the nonsense from his mother or his sibling.  The father is TA, the mother is TA and OP YTA. You have no right to inflict pain on your brother because of the pain your father, and then your mother, caused you both. Yes, we should heal ourselves as adults. That doesn't always happen easily and in this family I can see why the brother is still struggling. No one was there to help him through the loss of his family unit, and he had to go through being shunned by his mother. He was a kid. Judging by what OP said about the father's reaction when OP found out, Tom likely suffered the same thing. For a full year, as a child, he had to live with a secret that hurt him. Alone. Now OP tells him all of that is his fault? Because he was manipulated by his selfish father as a child, and his mother dropped him as he was involved in the affair somehow? That's not right.", "A 14 year old watched his mother fawn and fight for his brother while throwing him away without a second thought. And that's for things that were not *his* fault either but he'd already spent a full year being manipulated into feeling were.\n\nSo yeah: lashing out at the person who got praised and adored for the thing you were getting blamed for, when you're a victim yourself and desperately in need to parental support and affirmation, only to discover your mother *does* blame you for all of it? Pretty understandable emotional reaction on his part too.", "She didn't push him away. She fought for 50/50 custody. She continued to talk to him and raised him in their home. However, they are both adults now and if they want to savage this relationship, they need to go to therapy. OP doesn't say if they had any therapy as children.", "I disagree. Because the reason the mom stepped back wasn't just because of Tom covering for the dad, but because he took it out on OP", "Getting 50/50 custody isn\u2019t throwing him away.", "Yeah bad situation  both were kids. Neither are at fault for parents actions.", "I see your point. I still feel that Tom should have received more support and a lot more explanation. He felt as though what he or his sibling did had something to do with the parental relationship, but that was not true. Either way, I would never turn my back on my child because they were acting out during such a terrible time.  I just don't understand how the mother could do that.", "She admitted that she kept him at a distance. You can throw someone away and still spend time with them.

Your mom stopped mothering him the same and that\u2019s not ok, it\u2019s damaging to a child, and you went with it. Poor Tom. He\u2019s not innocent in his own mind probably, when he was just a kid!

You think he enjoyed keeping that secret for a year? You think he didn't think about telling your mother? Knowing full well it would rip his family apart if she knew?\nHe was put in the same position as you but with more awareness to what the fallout would be if he spoke up. Your dad potentially played on this too. \n\nAt that age he probably had friends whose parents had divorced and only see one parent on weekends. \n\nYour mother rejected her son over something that wasn't his fault, something that should never have been put on his shoulders.  \nInstead of trying to repair the damage, she opted to become a part-time parent in his life.

It's the dad's fault, not your brother's.", "Unpopular opinion, but YTA. So is your dad and mum. \nObviously you're not the a-hole for telling your mum, but you are the a-hole for blaming your brother for your mother bias. Your brother was a CHILD that didn't want to \"ruin\" his family. Your mother is an a-hole for either not understanding that or not caring enough. Her being a shitty mother should not be excused.", "This is gonna be an unpopular vote: ESH except for Tom. Dad for very obvious reasons, mom for basically going \u201cIDGAF\u201d on Tom because of what her unfaithful and manipulative husband did, AND lying over the years about the evident favoritism. You for basically being your mom\u2019s echo chamber.\n\nYour mom had every right to be upset about what Tom did, but **she basically withheld love and affection for him because of those feelings**. That for me is worse than capital punishment. Not that I condone capital punishment, but at least the physical pain goes away. Your brother needed to learn that moving forward, he should always do the right thing even if it meant breaking up your family. What he learned is that no matter how many right things you do, it wouldn\u2019t matter because you\u2019re marked for life.", "NTA but both your parents are.  I understand your mom being hurt and that parents are people, but their love for their children is supposed to be unconditional.  Your bro was only 13, should have known what he was doing was wrong but still young enough to not be expected to always make the right choice.  For your mom to essentially abandon him had to mess him up, unfortunate that he decided to lash out at you and more so that your parents didn't see that as a cry for help.  She failed him just like he failed her, but the big big difference is that she was a fully grown adult. He was still a kid.  Your brother is 100% justified in complaining about how your mom treated him and continues to.  I'd try sympathizing with him a bit more if you want a relationship with him, if not, then keep defending your mom emotionally abandoning one of her kids.", "Tom was 14.  Still a child.  Not his responsibility to tell or not to tell.  YTA.", "Your dad is the AH.  And broker up the family and split in like this.  Your brother was a child as well and was in a hard place.", "OP instead of blaming your brother maybe have a chat with your mom about how wrong it was of her to distance herself from her older child. Both your parents are AH who don\u2019t see beyond their own noses.", "ESH except for Tom.

What kind of bullshit is that?! When you have kids it\u2019s for life not until they are teens !!! Instead of keeping him at bay for fear of being disappointed again, she could have gone to therapy to work out her feelings, gone to therapy with Tom, tell him that in the future she\u2019d rather he tell the truth instead of wanting to spare her feelings. She directed her hurt and anger towards her TEENAGE son instead of the ADULT man who cheated on her ! That\u2019s disgusting !\n\nYou\u2019re TA for justifying your mom\u2019s behavior.

Op, your brother was a child when this happened. Teens are still children, and your father probably manipulated him by saying he needed to keep quiet or it would break up the family. He messed up with not telling your mom, and again for bullying you, but he was a kid put in the middle of adult issues that he didn't know how to handle. I get that she was hurt, but your mom blamed a teen for her cheating husband and damaged her relationship with her child. \n\nNow it sounds like your brother has some real issues with your mom, which is understandable. Your brother is entitled to his feelings and It's not fair to blame him for a bad relationship with your mom when your mom pushed him away.
