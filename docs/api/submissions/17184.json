When I was 7 I walked in on our dad kissing a woman who wasn't my mom. I was shocked, confused, and felt sick in that very same moment and started to cry. The woman ran away while my dad tried to get me to calm down and convince me that I didn't see what I saw. I was naive but not dumb and while I couldn't fully understand what was happening I knew that my mom (51f) would be upset. \n\nMy mom was out of town when this happened and my dad spent the rest of her trip to try and convince to not say a word. The only reason why I started to go through with it was because Tom came to me and said that it was better to keep quiet to spare our mom's feelings. I didn't say a word when mom came back but I had a hard time being around her as well as trying to eat. My mom was worried that I was sick but my dad brushed her off. I held in the secret for about three days and then had a break down at school when my teacher was going over the importance of honesty.\n\nMy mom came to the school and I ended up telling her everything in tears. My mom held me and told me that it was okay and that nothing was my fault. My mom confronted my dad and during the divorce it came out that Tom knew for at least a year but never said anything. Our parents ended up needing to sell the house and Tom started to lash out at me, and that's when I think something in my mom finally snapped. She didn't fight over custody for Tom the way that she did for me and ended up with 50/50 with him while primary for me. \n\nOver the years my mom would still talk to Tom and try to put in the effort to have a relationship with him but it wasn't the same as with me. When asked she would say that teen boys don't need their moms as much as younger ones do so I would get most of her attention and care. One day I straight up asked my mom why she interacted with Tom differently than me (now that I was older too) and she confessed that she was hurt at how Tom was willing to not only say nothing about my dad's affair but also covered for him once before too. \n\nMy mom admitted that while she still loved Tom she just didn't have it in her heart to fully trust him again, and preferred to keep her distance in case he ever disappointed her again. I can admit that it was sad to hear but I could also understand it. Recently Tom has been going on rants about how my mom played favorites and I told him that it was his own fault for being more loyal to our cheating dad than to our mom who was wronged. Tom has went VLC with me since and my dad called me A but his opinion on this means nothing to me so AITA?", "created_utc": 1684043294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h3xhu/aita_telling_my_brother_that_its_his_own_fault/", "score": 1686, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad is TA. Tom isn't. He was young and under the same pressure as you. A great responsibility was placed on him at the age of 13. In his mind, he was keeping the family together. Your dad is an ass for putting that pressure on him, and later on you. Your mom was hurt, understadably so, but you all needed counseling in that situation.", "NTA. Look your brother, intentionally on not, was part of your father\u2019s betrayal of his wife and family. So he was part of his mother\u2019s heartbreak. It must have been incredibly difficult for her and I could understand some of her resentment as well and I assume some of your own.\n\nThat being said, perhaps it\u2019s time to have a sit down with your mum and talk to her about all this and how it has affected your relationship with your brother. Perhaps you can get some family counselling (don\u2019t include your dad) to help you all air out everything you need to say and get some help to deal with all this.", "NTA...you did the right thing telling you mom. I cannot understand why he would mind not telling her. She is right to feel hurt and betrayed from her son. Because both the most important men in her life lied to her for so long. I can understand why your brother feels that way. He don't have the relationship that he wants with your mom and this is hurting him. I believe that he knows his mistake but he has to do something to earn your moms trust back", "Nta\n\nFrom your brothers perspective, he was a kid who did an awful thing, and his mom revoked her love over it, reinforcing why he was right to do what he did. I'd be curious what is going through his head under the anger.\n\nHe was a kid, and a trusted figure told him it was for the best. It was wrong of him to do it, but we shouldn't be punished for mistakes we made as children.", "NTA.\n\nYou told the truth.  Both then and now.  Tom may have been a kid at the time, but even then he had to know that keeping that sort of a secret would have serious back blast if it was ever discovered.  It was discovered, his relationship with his mom was destroyed, and its safe to say it will never be repaired.... But none of that is your fault.\n\nThe only asshole here is your dad.", "Your NtA but your dad AND your mum BOTH are. Your dad is TAH for putting that burden on a child. He used his position of \"power\" to manipulate a child into keeping a secret and your mum is the AH for punishing a child for doing what a parent asked him to do and not realising that he was let down too. Your mum is pissed at the wrong person. This isn't Tom's fault at all. He was a child,he didn't know any different and she essentially said \"f\" you and gave up on him. Can you honestly not see how wrong that was? It's not your brother's fault he isn't close to your mum, it's your mum's fault for punishing a child for something his dad did!", "NTA\n\nYou just told your adult brother the truth. That's it.  You are not responsible for his relationships with both parents. \n\nYes,  back then Tom was a kid, but so were you, and he has been lashing out at you for everything bad which happened in his life. On you, his little  brother.\n\nBehaving  like that for a teen is bad but forgivable, but for a young adult when he is almost 30 - nah, he needs therapy. \n\nHe also had more than enough time to figure out why the person he'd been lying to for at least a year and his \"scapegoat\" are closer to each other than to him. This is not a rocket science.", "YTA for saying that, and your mom is an enormous AH.\n\nTeenage boys do need their mothers, and they need their mothers' to not blame them for things that aren't their fault. \n\nYour dad is the one who cheated. Your brother was a teenager, under the influence and manipulation of his father. You know, the person he's been taught to trust, respect and obey his whole life. \n\nHe was convinced that if he told his mother, the family would break apart and she'd blame him and - oh, what do you know, she did just that. Because instead of being a *parent*, she decided to be an AH who blamed a child for her partner's actions.\n\nAnd it sounds like your mom has been manipulating your view and perspective on things. Just like your father did to your brother, all those years ago.", "YTA\n\nYour brother was just a kid, 13-14 years old, when this happened.  And it isn't as if they have a class in school teaching \"what to do if you catch one of your parents cheating on the other.\"\n\nYour brother probably looked to your father for guidance, a the adult on the spot when he discovered this, and your father probably convinced him that your mother would be upset if she learned the truth.  (Not untrue, just manipulative.)\n\nYour brother was old enough at the time of the divorce that the court would listen to his preferences about custody, while you were young enough that the court would pay less attention to you. 50/50 custody for a teenager seems reasonable - cheating generally does not affect custody issues.  I'm actually wondering more if your mother used fighting over your custody as a way to punish your father, separating you from him.  How much time did you actually spend with him after the divorce, growing up?  Were you able to develop/maintain a healthy relationship with your father?\n\nIf your mother was upset with your brother, a child caught in an impossible situation he was naturally unprepared to deal with, she should have sought guidance from a social worker or therapist on managing her own feelings without blaming a child, and guidance on how to be supportive of your brother, as a parent, despite her hurt feelings. \n\nYour father is to blame for his actions. Not your brother.  That includes any manipulation of your brother your father engaged in to get your brother to do what your father wanted.", "Your mom is a huge AH. She seems to blame your brother for not wanting his family to fall apart based on your father's bad decisions. And is still blaming him more than a decade later. He was not responsible and he should not have been put in the position to tell or not tell your mom anything. She can't understand that. \n\nYTA for telling him this is about loyalty. It isn't. It is about playing favorites. You 'ratted\" out your dad so your mom loves and cares more about you. Your brother tried to spare her feelings and keep the family together so it is all his fault and he is untrustworthy in your mom's eyes for something he kept a secret as a young teen.", "Why would the opinion of a reddit sub mean more than yr family\u2019s \n\nYTA. Your brother was a kid. It\u2019s probably best you stay low contact if you can\u2019t empathize with each other tbh", "So your brother at 13-14.  Tried to say nothing and keep his family together \n\nYou told the hard truth \n\nYour dads an AH for what he pulled \nyour mother also is for her treatment of Tom whilst favouring you\n\nAnd also you suck for your treatment to your brother and mental hurting him", "NTA. I don't know where are you from but in my country 14 year olds are considered to be mature. When I was 14 I went to highschool in a different city (using public transport to get there and lived in a student hostel) and saw my parents only on the weekends and school breaks. I managed my life on my own, handled my finances and all in all was a mini adult.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that he was not a child. At 14 he shouldn't be so easily manipulated like you at 7 so it was kind of a decision of him to not tell it to your mom and I can totally understand that it hurt your mum.\nSo if this is the reason why your mother keeps distance with him you are NTA for stating facts. \n\nHowever I think your mother is a huge one for letting her son go. Even if she was angry with him and even if he bullied you she should have fight for him, went to therapy together and with time forgive him. Your brother can be blamed for what he did at 14 but shouldn't suffer its consequences for the rest of his life.", "NTA. Your brother is facing the consequences of his actions. Now I understand that he was still a child when this happened. However, as an adult he should had apologize to your mom about his actions. He knows he is in the wrong. Only he can change the relationship he has with his mom.", "NTA\n\nTom maybe didn't know better back then, but now he does. He had plenty of time to apologize and try to form a relationship again, but he didn't", "Info- has your brother ever apologized to your mother for helping your father hide his cheating?\nI think this is a case of justified asshole. What you said was crappy but it wasn\u2019t wrong and off your brother had never apologized to your mom then you are all the more justified for pointing out his nonsense.", "Pretty sure your brother just posted his side of things", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He was 13. He was not equipped to make adult decisions and holds no responsibility for either of his parents actions.", "He was 13. Just as the OP described how the father manipulated him to stay silent, I have no doubt that he manipulated the older brother into staying silent too. He was probably convinced that he was doing the right thing. The mom punished him for doing what he was told to do by an authority figure. Are you seriously suggesting that the older brother should apologize for his actions as a 13 year old?", "I read that one too but it's the exact opposite of this one. This one, the younger brother knew and didn't keep it a secret while in the other one, the younger brother  kept it a secret and had a bad relationship with his mother.", "By VLC, I suspect OP meant \"very low contact\" which does make sense, given the conflict and the way the kids have been manipulated into blaming each other for their parents' bad choices and mistakes.", "VLC = very low contact I imagine", "Hard to expect someone to be a mature adult when their mother in a sense abandons him at such a young age", "The mother pushed him away. Of course, he's distant from her. What parent does that to a child? She pushed him away because he did what he thought was protecting her and their family. You don't hold your children accountable for what they did as a child. These parents made huge mistakes. Op and brother suffered the worst of the consequences. The brother doesn't deserve the nonsense from his mother or his sibling.  The father is TA, the mother is TA and OP YTA. You have no right to inflict pain on your brother because of the pain your father, and then your mother, caused you both. Yes, we should heal ourselves as adults. That doesn't always happen easily and in this family I can see why the brother is still struggling. No one was there to help him through the loss of his family unit, and he had to go through being shunned by his mother. He was a kid. Judging by what OP said about the father's reaction when OP found out, Tom likely suffered the same thing. For a full year, as a child, he had to live with a secret that hurt him. Alone. Now OP tells him all of that is his fault? Because he was manipulated by his selfish father as a child, and his mother dropped him as he was involved in the affair somehow? That's not right.", "A 14 year old watched his mother fawn and fight for his brother while throwing him away without a second thought. And that's for things that were not *his* fault either but he'd already spent a full year being manipulated into feeling were.\n\nSo yeah: lashing out at the person who got praised and adored for the thing you were getting blamed for, when you're a victim yourself and desperately in need to parental support and affirmation, only to discover your mother *does* blame you for all of it? Pretty understandable emotional reaction on his part too.", "She didn't push him away. She fought for 50/50 custody. She continued to talk to him and raised him in their home. However, they are both adults now and if they want to savage this relationship, they need to go to therapy. OP doesn't say if they had any therapy as children.", "I disagree. Because the reason the mom stepped back wasn't just because of Tom covering for the dad, but because he took it out on OP", "Getting 50/50 custody isn\u2019t throwing him away.", "Yeah bad situation  both were kids. Neither are at fault for parents actions.", "I see your point. I still feel that Tom should have received more support and a lot more explanation. He felt as though what he or his sibling did had something to do with the parental relationship, but that was not true. Either way, I would never turn my back on my child because they were acting out during such a terrible time.

You for basically being your mom\u2019s echo chamber.\n\nYour mom had every right to be upset about what Tom did, but **she basically withheld love and affection for him because of those feelings**. That for me is worse than corporal punishment. Not that I condone corporal punishment, but at least the physical pain goes away. Your brother needed to learn that moving forward, he should always do the right thing even if it meant breaking up your family.

I understand your mom being hurt and that parents are people, but their love for their children is supposed to be unconditional.  Your bro was only 13, should have known what he was doing was wrong but still young enough to not be expected to always make the right choice.  For your mom to essentially abandon him had to mess him up, unfortunate that he decided to lash out at you and more so that your parents didn't see that as a cry for help.  She failed him just like he failed her, but the big big difference is that she was a fully grown adult. He was still a kid.  Your brother is 100% justified in complaining about how your mom treated him and continues to.

Op, your brother was a child when this happened. Teens are still children, and your father probably manipulated him by saying he needed to keep quiet or it would break up the family.

How horribly isolating and lacking any real love and support his family life has been for most of his life!\n\nFor me, the ideal would be that you apologize to your brother, consider some counseling so that you can form your own understanding and perspective on your family history - without self-serving parental influence. Maybe you can rebuild a healthy relationship with your brother. You still love and have a good relationship, but you can also be honest with her as your form your own, independent view of her and your brother's relationship. Maybe she could even open her eyes, see the unjust harm she caused him, and do what she can to repair - or at least own - that damage she caused.\n\n**Your mom intentionally inflicted harm on your brother. In what universe do you consider it possible for a parent harming a child to be \"justified\"?**", "Both parents are TA. Not you, and not your brother. Your brother was 13! He only did what he thought was right at the time. His father told him to do something and he did it. It's as simple as that. It is unfair to make your children lie to save the family, it's a huge burden to carry. I also can't believe your mother still blames your brother for not telling her. Keep children out of your marital problems! It's disgusting and traumatic!", "So strictly answering the question in the header, yes YTA for this specific incident. However this is neither of you or your brothers fault. In concerns to your dad it's obvious why he's an AH but your mom abandoned her 13 year old child because he got caught in the middle of a horrible situation. He has every right to be upset she never tried to be a true mom for the last 14 years. I really hope one day you all can sit down and talk all this out but it seems you guys let it fester and it probably will never be fixed.", "NTA, but your mom is (your cheating father obviously is as well, but he\u2019s not even worthy of discussion here).  \n\nThink back to how your father pressured you after you saw him kissing another woman. You were seven, too young to carry the burden of that lie, but you still managed to do so for three days. Your brother was older than you, and your father pressured him in the same way; he was made to believe that in telling your mom the truth, he would destroy your family. \n\nNow consider this: *your brother is no more guilty by lying to your mother than you were during the three days that you did the exact same thing.*\n\nYour brother was older than you, but he was still very much a child when this happened. Your mother neglected him and essentially sent him away. She emotionally damaged him and punished him *after your father did the exact same thing to him*.\n\nI have four children.

I'm not sure where this is based but here in Australia you hear in the news a lot lately of 13-15 year Olds stealing cars, stabbing people or the most common these days holding other teenagers against their will and physically hurting them often while recording their torture. People don't downplay all of that by saying oh but they are just kids. No. Teenagers know right from wrong. \nTom is nta for the initial lying to his mother. Although I don't agree with it I can see how some people would want to keep quiet to keep their family together although he is definitely ta for showing no remorse for it when it all came out. He even actively helped cover up what was going on. And he never once expressed to his mother that he was sorry, or didn't want to hurt her? \nThe mother is nta either. Yes she was the parent but everyone has their limits and she still had 50/50 custody she didn't abandon him like everyone is saying. Everyone is being extra dramatic about that part. \nOp is NTA although potentially a harsh way to put it he is right. Toms actions and lack of remorse is what got them to this point.", "YTA and so is your mum.  Your father had years to work on your brother and persuade him to keep silent but only days to work on you.  I think your mother needed to take some responsibility for her choices and allowing her child to be manipulated like that and should have worked on repairing the relationship.  A 7 year old will often blab out thinks whilst a teen will overthink the consequences.  Both are age appropriate responses.", "YTA for what you said to your brother.

Father cheated, I was 13 and I KNEW the implications, I didn't want my parents to break but I didn't want him to be sneaking around mom because I knew what cheating meant, even if he said it would break us. I would rather have a broken family with both parents happy than see one of my parents wronged. I told him to stop being a cheater because it's disgusting! Then I told mom. \nShe knew for a long time but she ignored it because \"at least he always comes back home to us\"\nI understand her logic but it's a very sad decision. I wouldn't do it.

I\u2019m saying that blanket statements like \u201clying is wrong\u201d are completely oblivious to complex situations that other people are facing and are damaging. Let\u2019s not blame the 14 year old who was pressured to lie by his dad and then blamed and abandoned afterwards by his mom- it\u2019s a shit hand to be dealt, especially for someone that young.", ">Saying 14 is too young loses all its power when the younger sibling did the right thing.\n\n No it doesn't.\n\nNow I'm not going to downplay the 14 year old's actions. I think a teenager is fully capable of understanding right and wrong here. But that's not how morality develops in kids.\n\nIt's definitely \"easier\" for a kid to tell the truth here. Look up developmental morality theories, like Piaget's. A 7 year old's morality is very basic. Things that are against the rules are bad, things that aren't are good. They can't really consider abstract reasoning that makes decisions gray. It's a lot easier to make the \"right\" decision here and tell the mom when you're too young to understand that it would likely mean divorce and completely upending your life. \n\nFor instance, a scenario given to kids is that a man's wife is dying. Medicine exists, but he can't afford it. He steals some from a pharmacy. A 7 year old will usually say that what the man did is wrong. Because stealing is bad. It's a rule. You can't break rules. They are too young for nuance.\n\nSometimes this is a good thing, like in OP's scenario where \"tell the truth\" is the rule, so the kid is torn up without having to take into account all the messy consequences that the truth would cause. But as in my example above, it also leaves no room for nuance when different moral questions clash with each other.", "From the mother? Quite agree...", "You and I do not know if he was fine, or if he was breaking inside.\n\nLook, from situations such as these, I only see kids that act this way because they are not safe enough in their relationships with the parents to face the outcomes of divorce. While morally wrong from the kid, it is a possible choice from them and it is on the parents to understand that, and overcome that.\n\nThe mother did not do that. In fact, here the mom latter checked-out emotionally, and in a way that OP noticed and thought the fault was Tom's.\n\nI cannot judge Tom too harshly for his actions and, given the mom's own actions, I cannot escape the feeling that may be he was right to fear the consequences of divorce.", "Tom was a 13 year old whose father - someone he should be able to trust, and who was in a position of significant power and influence over him - convinced him it was the best course of action and threatened that his family would be torn apart if he didn't.\n\nTom was not a manipulator. He was a victim of manipulation, and then he was blamed by the one person who should have been there for him.", "What a strange thing a kid who don't want to see his world exploding. Especially a kid who don't want to be the bearer of a bad news. What a bad kid he was for wanting to keep his world safe and not being the one hurting his mother by telling her that his father is cheating. It's really surprising", "That's what teenagers do. They are a little bit selfish and eventually they mature. I can't believe the lack of understanding especially since we all went through that phase and were around people in said phase", "Bull. OP says his own mother was open about blaming Tom for his silence. She was clearly and visibly angry and withdrawing from him the moment she realised he'd known, and never once considered that Tom was a victim here that needed his mother. \n\nHe was a 13-year-old, who'd been manipulated into believing that silence was the best option and whose life and family were falling apart *exactly as he'd been threatened it would*. The narrative his father has foisted as been immediately validated and its all being pinned on Tom. \"Why did you have to ruin everything\" is exactly what he's going to think - no one's helping him see otherwise.\n\nThe OP was seven years old. He remembers his own emotional breakdown; he wouldn't have had the insight to see how it tore Tom up, but we can clearly see his reaction is from having to deal with a pressure that shouldn't have been his in the first place for over a year. And when the secret was out, it was a messy divorce that resulted in their selling their house, upending their family in every which way, and every other action that would suggest that the lies Tom had been fed about everything being ruined if the secret got out being validated. \n\nOf course he lashed out. He was a victim in a situation that's stressful for even perfectly adjusted kids and stuck watching unequal treatment while he was actively blamed and neglected.", "Might as well be when you seek primary custody solely for your other kid.", "It is when you fight tooth and nail for primary custody of one son, and then shrug your shoulders and go 'whatever' with the second.", "He was 13, not 3.

And he showed zero concern for her. I would have expected that from the 7 year old.", ">He was lashing out when he was still a child. And even to this day she refuses to have a relationship with him. How exactly does he win here?\n\nIdk maybe start with some honest self reflection rather than blaming everyone else for the reprocussions of failing this character test", "He didn\u2019t do anything. He got stuck as a bystander to what someone else did.\nHis parents made the mistakes and should be making it up to him. \nParents shouldn\u2019t pick favourites, let alone make\nIt very obvious to everyone who it is.\nIt\u2019s not a character flaw to wish your mum loved you.\n\nImagine not thinking it was both parents role to protect and love him.

You should be able to trust your children? As though it's not normal for children to go through several normal developmental stages where lying to their parents is par for the course?\n\nI mean, was I the only teenager sneaking out of the house to try to walk through the Taco Bell drive through at 3am? Parents should absolutely not trust kids, they're always up to something lol. You still have to raise and do your best with them anyway.", "You don't get to throw a young teenager away for making bad decisions. It is absolutely relevant that they are mother and child - she chose to put him into this world, she is responsible for raising him. As a child, he did not have the maturity to fully understand the consequences of his actions, she as an adult should have. Choosing to neglect him rather than going to family therapy is her choice, and one that makes her a bad parent.", "No. You don't permanently ban a kid from being able to grow or change in your estimation, and if you do, you are a bad parent.", "The 7yo is 20 when he said what he thinks. So I think he\u2019s an ass for it. I did not say that the 13/14yo shouldn\u2019t have said something to mom I said mom failed him to put this on the kid who just wanted mom and dad and brother to be a family\u2026 she just made sure he knew he didn\u2019t have his mother either.", "She didn\u2019t neglect him but she shunned him for his complicity at the very mature age of 13", "So you didn't actually read the post then? \n\n> When asked why she would say that teenage boys don't need their moms as much as younger ones do so I would get most of her attention and care\n\nThat's bullshit, and emotional neglect. Again, she was the adult, and instead of stepping away from her own child should have had some empathy regarding the difficult situation he himself was in. As a parent you can't solely consider your own feelings within your relationship with your children, or at least, you shouldn't - I'm aware of how many selfish parents there are. He wasn't an unrelated adult, he was her child, that's the entire point. \n\nWhy would he give her feelings a second thought when she didn't do the same for him, and has made her resentment of him very clear?", "But had emotional custody during her 50/50 physical custody?\n\nShe did not starvr not left her kid on the streets. Yay?", "He was manipulated and gaslit for a year.\n\nSo their mother lashing out at the child she's responsible for, their entire lives after, is excusable but Tom's short-lived trauma response isn't?", "Lol, no where in the post does it say he didn\u2019t try - only that she was distant with him.\n\nI am a mum and would love heaven and earth to never make my child feel this way. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t have that", "i think the part that changes it to tom an ahole for me personal \"***and Tom started to lash out at me\"*** OP brother started lashing (that could mean a lot of things from rude words to physical violence where i live) at a seven year old that was feeling terrible because of the shit things their father was doing instead of you know being angry at the dad for being shit in the first place.\n\nAlso i think its telling that thats when their mothers view of tom changed ***\"and that's when I think something in my mom finally snapped\"*** after all i try and look at this from both tom and the mothers side and when i look at it from the mothers side i think i could forgive tom for keeping it secret because as people are saying he was a kid being manipulated by his dad but the moment he started lashing out and blaming op who was honest with her basically doubling down on lying to her was the right thing to do i think i would probably snap as well.", "I mean, I put myself in Tom's shoes as well. I still think he's an a******. I'll be it I don't believe that it was his fault He was an a******, that doesn't change it. That doesn't change his actions. That doesn't change the choices he made. They may have been due to pressure, but he still made those choices. He did have the choice to tell his mother. He chose not to.\nJust because you have a lot of pressure on you to make one choice does not automatically mean that the other choice is gone. It does not mean that you CANT Make the right choice. Unfortunately, Tom felt a pressure. And due to his decision, he broke the truss of his mother had in him. Just because you are a parent does not mean that you need to unconditionally trust your children their entire lives. Yes you will love them, you will care about them, but that does not mean you have to believe them or trust them. That doesn't mean that they can't hurt you deeply beyond repair in some instances.", ">He had a major character fail at 13 - that's much different than at 20\n\nSure. But a fail on something this major is still a fail. For example say your kid holds up a liquor store. It's a major moral failing irregardless if he was a teen or 21. But the expectation would be the older you are the higher the expectation you should know better. 13 he absolutely should have known better.\n\n> He was likely being pressured and gaslit by his own father, who probably used the kid's biggest fear against him (that his parents would get a divorce). \n\nSame parameters of the character test that the 7 yr old went up against. Hell I'd say OP had it a bit worse because they also had to deal with a elder brother trying to pressure them into keeping quiet as well. Yet the youngest succeeded where the eldest failed.\n\n>I try to put myself in Tom's shoes when judging him\n\nI do to. And idk if it's cause I grew up in a single parent home, or cultural, but I'd rather die than face the shame of failing that kind of character test towards my Mother whose done nothing wrong.", ">No. You don't permanently ban a kid from being able to grow or change in your estimation,\n\nOnce bitten twice shy. He committed such a serious personal violation of trust. To his own mother no less. AND he isn't even self reflecting on how he went wrong. I'm not saying the earth is completely scorched. But balls in his court to make the repairs and he's still floundering.....", ">very mature age of 13\n\nYall keep bringing this up. It would hold more weight if not for the fact a literal 7 yr old beat him in the same character test....\n\n>but she shunned him for his complicity\n\nSure. Someone who shows they are untrustworthy does not deserve the luxury of your trust.", "He still doesn't get why brother is favoured where as even if dad's at fault, id have been destroyed by guilt and would blame dad and myself before I'd ever lay blame on mum or brother."]}
