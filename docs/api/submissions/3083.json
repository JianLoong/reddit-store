I mention how having children can be a good and great thing, and to retaliate she always brings up the negatives about having children, constantly saying its horrible and tiring and why it just wont be good for her. She also keeps mentioning how parents regret it almost as if shes expecting me to do the same. It turns into a fight, and we stop speaking to each other for a few days.\n\nHowever, now i\u2019m starting to have doubts because of her. What if she\u2019s right and i regret having children? After another fight we had, i mentioned this to her and she got mad at me and told me its not her fault i cant think for myself (which isnt true). She called me a btch and told me to stop bringing the topic up if i dont like what she says. Now i feel bad that i kind of blamed her for my own worry and insecurity even though she kept saying negative things despite knowing i want children.

At least she isn\u2019t planning on having one.", "YTA for blaming her, nobody's forcing you to talk about this with her and you should have doubts, having kids is a big deal.", "YTA. If at 26 you\u2019re blaming someone for making you doubt if you want kids then you are too immature to have them. Stop trying and grow up.", "YTA It sounds like she understands that those reasons apply to HER and not everyone. You have different opinions on this. That's fine.

Why do you keep having the same discussion with her? That seems like a ridiculous waste of time. \nIf a few arguments have caused you to doubt yourself then you really need to rethink having kids anytime soon. You aren\u2019t ready. Kids can sense weakness like that and use it against you. They will run all over you. Maybe take a bunch of realistic parenting classes. Speak to other parents your age about current parenting problems. Don\u2019t ask your parents because the trouble they had when you were young is way different. That would be a far more intelligent way of deciding than arguing with your little sister. And yea. YTA for blaming her for your own inability to form and keep an opinion.

Good luck", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you keep spontaneously telling your childfree sister that having kids is great?\n\nWhy in the world would you do that?", "YTA.

You don't have to agree on the subject as it's not the two of you debating whether to have a child together. She can make her decision and you can make yours. From your description, it seems as though she is only making her point of view clear for *herself* while you seem to be desperately trying to convince her that her point of view is wrong and everyone, including her, should want to have children. Are you trying to convince her or yourself? \n\nTo be honest, it does seem as though you are having trouble thinking for yourself in this regard. You shouldn't be trying for kids if your sister's choice regarding *her own* life is making you doubt choices you make for yours. Learn to be a separate entity from your sister. She doesn't need to do what you do and vice versa. The last thing you should be doing is trying to put the blame on her for your indecisiveness. If she is able to raise doubts in your mind, it is likely you haven't thought this decision through and haven't thought about the arguments she makes by yourself. \n\nYes, childfree people are usually happier than those with children. So are unmarried women compared to married ones. Regarding happiness, statistically, only men profit from being married. So what? Marrying is the right choice for some women nevertheless. But that doesn't mean all women should do it. Having and raising children is hard and expensive and time-consuming. Yes, you will have regrets. When you can't sleep the fifth night in a row because your baby is teething, when you haven't had a good rest for the entire day and now your child is screaming down the entire supermarket because it too is tired or wants sweets or whatever, when you have to change your clothes for the third time this day because baby threw up on you. You WILL have moments of regret. To think all will be peaches and roses when you have a child is naive and dangerous. But you know what? It doesn't matter. If you want a child, you know all these things and you have a child nevertheless. Because you will get over the regrets. Sometimes after a minute, sometimes it takes a while longer. When they smile at you. When they ask you for help. When they run to give you a hug. When they melt your heart by telling you they love you. To anticipate some problems doesn't mean you shouldn't do something. It means you decide for yourself if you can live with these difficulties. Your sister doesn't want to. That's her choice and her right. You have to think about what you want, irrespective of her opinions and her choice. But think about the reality and not some made up rose colored scenario.", "YTA", "YTA. You do realize there is ENDLESS pressure for her to have kids? That\u2019s the societal norm and those of us who don\u2019t want children (especially women) are constantly under HARSH scrutiny as to why we are refusing to procreate. She probably feels she has to defend herself when you go on about wanting babies. She is in no way responsible for what do you do or don\u2019t do. Stop projecting on her.", "YTA and she\u2019s right, why are you continuously bringing up the topic in the first place if you don\u2019t like what she has to say? If you want kids then have them, you don\u2019t need your little sister\u2019s permission and she doesn\u2019t have to want kids herself for you to have some of your own.

YTA", "Why do you keep bringing up this discussion with her? That's something to discuss with your spouse, not your sister.

Constantly defending myself and saying what the negatives are because people like you can't take \"I don't want kids\" as an answer. Leave her alone and stop bringing up the subject. You want kids, she doesn't. See how easy that is. Minding your own business is free y'know.", "YTA. I have kids, and I adore them. But it is hard. I'd never change it for anything and I knew going in that having kids is hard work. To me it's worth it to have them, they are some of my favorite people, but I also recognize that not everyone will feel that way and that's ok!\n\nThe only person you need to talk about having kids with is your husband. It is no one else's business and no one else will raise them. So you need to decide TOGETHER what you want and what kind of parents you want to be. \n\nIt sounds like your sister has made her decision and in your efforts to try to change her mind and make her agree with you she made points that you hadn't thought of and now you're second guessing. There's nothing wrong with that, but that isn't her fault. If you think you can't handle kids, don't have them. Being a good parent is hard, rewarding and wonderful in many ways, but very hard.", "YTA, if you have doubts on your beliefs, that's because you have not done enough research to cover all your bases. Your sister only showed you (NOT intentionally, because I doubt she was actively trying to change your mind, she is just justifying her POV) where those uncovered bases are. \n\nYou should definitely apologize, it's not her fault that you haven't thought through having children and I think it is amazing that you have realised that now that you aren't pregnant instead of later when thing would have become a lot more difficult. \n\nWhat you can do, is try to identify what are those things your sister said that triggered your insecurity and see how you can solve those insecurities. One of those is people regretting to have children. Well, do you think you will be prone to feel that way? If no, then you have no issue. If you do, then research more... What do people who feel this way do about it? Do they abandon these children? Would you do that?  Would they, instead, seek therapy to understand where the regret comes from? Would you rather do that? What are common sources of people feeling this way? Maybe their partners don't help enough, then talk to your husband to make sure you are on the same page when it comes to childcare. Maybe is a money issue, then make sure you are financially stable enough to bring a child into the household and that includes having money for emergencies. Maybe it is an issue that the couple don't have time for themselves individually or as a couple because of childcare, then again, talk to your husband about it. Maybe it is an issue with the body image post-partum and some people blame the child, then make sure you have a support system to help you navigate that situation if you were to be in that situation. Maybe the child is challenging in some way, then make sure you and your husband are prepared to face these situations.\n\nHere's the thing, it sounds like you want a big family like the movies and that's dangerously unrealistic. From your post I am getting the vibe that you haven't been mature about what having ONE baby is like, let alone many. So you really need to have these conversations with your husband before starting a family. If you really are the kind of person who loves children and want a family, you WILL find a way to sort all these potential issues out. Many families do and they are very happy, so it is possible. But in order to provide a healthy environment for a child, as I'm sure you want to, you need to think this through with your husband NOW. Remember that having a child is not just a cute baby that will look like the perfect combo of you and the person you love the most that you get to hug and kiss and all that. That's wonderful but it doesn't end there, it is a human, that won't let you sleep at night and then will be very active kid evolving to a rebellious teen. So you will be tired some days and needing to rest, it's totally normal (and again, having conversations about when to rest so the other parent is there for the child is important I can't stress this enough). But if you are a family person, all that effort and sacrifice will be worthy when you see the amazing person(s) you and your husband raised many years from now. You just need to know if you have it in yourself, your husband and your support system to go through that.\n\nThe other option is that you aren't prepared yet, then no worries because there's still time. Maybe one day everything you need will be ready for you. \n\nLastly, maybe you decide it's not for you and there's nothing wrong with that either. It is better not to have a child that bring it into a family that won't care for them as much as they'll deserve and need. Life is full of things for you and your husband to do and feel fulfilled by so children are not the only option.\n\nApologize to your sister, something tells me people are commenting on her choice to be childfree and she doesn't deserve that since it is her choice, not her parents, not yours. To me this debate looked more like she trying to defend herself with arguments rather than trying to change your mind. I could be wrong, but I doubt it. She, indirectly, did something important for you by making you think about this. She made sure that whenever you have a child, you'll be the best mother you can. That's why we need people who think different from us, sometimes. I wish you and your sister all the best.", "Yeah you can definitely think for yourself, anyways here are our thoughts on your situation...YTA.", "YTA if her saying it would be bad for HER changes your mind your opinion wasn\u2019t strong to begin with.

As a childfree person, there is nothing more obnoxious than people who think everyone should be having children and have to tell you so. I know it's shocking, but it's possible to live a happy life without children. Some people value their hobbies, careers, and relationships over baby-making and childcare. \n\nIf you are having doubts about children, maybe think about why. Why did you want them so bad in the first place? What is it about these doubts that calls to you?\n\nYou should take your sister's advice- stop bringing it up if you don't like her views. She's probably sick of you trying to tell her that she's living her life wrong when she's perfectly happy.", "YTA, she didn't \"put you off having children,\" hearing about the reality of having them did.

I mention how having children can be a good and great thing, and to retaliate she always brings up the negatives about having children, constantly saying its horrible and tiring and why it just wont be good for her. She also keeps mentioning how parents regret it almost as if shes expecting me to do the same. It turns into a fight, and we stop speaking to each other for a few days.\n\nHowever, now i\u2019m starting to have doubts because of her. What if she\u2019s right and i regret having children? After another fight we had, i mentioned this to her and she got mad at me and told me its not her fault i cant think for myself (which isnt true). She called me a btch and told me to stop bringing the topic up if i dont like what she says. Now i feel bad that i kind of blamed her for my own worry and insecurity even though she kept saying negative things despite knowing i want children. So AITA?\n\ntl;dr i kind of blamed my younger childfree sister for making me doubt wanting to have children\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You need to approach the topic with skepticism and search out the blogs and articles from people who will report both the good and the bad; the penalty for being a mother in every area of your life is so large that you should commit only if it's truly YOUR dream (not your parents, not your husband, not your friends, not your in-laws.) YOU will be the one with all the physical \"hits,\" the job set-backs, the constant judgement from strangers, and the additional household duties.

Is what your sister chooses to do with her womb any of your business?  Absolutely not.  \n\nIf she doesn't want kids, then having them WOULD make HER miserable, which you say she clarifies.  If you like kids and want to give one love and happiness despite the ups and downs, then what is horrible to her may not seem so bad to you, but that doesn't mean she's not allowed to feel that it's not right for HER.  If she wants to be sterilized, then more power to her.  She knows what's right for her.\n\nSo yeah, she's right.  You need to think for yourself and do what's right for you.

Also if you're not willing to risk having a disabled child, then I'm not the biggest fan of having kids.

That\u2019s exactly why your sister gets defensive. You keep bringing up a topic that she\u2019s not enthusiastic about. Then you get upset when she shares her opinions. Not everyone likes kids. I\u2019m not sure why people have such a big issue with that. I know people who had kids at a very young age and now regret it because they feel like they didn\u2019t think things out very well. Others feel like they sacrificed their youth because they were forced to have kids by their family members. Having a child is not a fulfilling moment for everybody. We all have different things that fulfill us. I\u2019m 32, and I don\u2019t have kids. I\u2019m happy with my life, regardless of being childless.

I strongly believe that people, especially women, should make educated and informed decisions about whether or not to have children. Regardless of which path you choose it is a monumental and life altering decision and should be taken very seriously.\n\nParenting is fucking HARD and doing it well is significantly harder. I have been blessed with an incredible mom who has shown me what unconditional love and unwavering support looks like.

I know both sides of the coin and the way both of my parents showed up in my life has heavily influenced my choice to never have children. It\u2019s **healthy** to question if you want all that comes with being a parent especially the responsibility and consequences. If you aren\u2019t ready, willing, and able to care for a disabled child you should not have children. (Anyone can become disabled at literally any time) If you aren\u2019t ready, willing, and able to work on your own issues and break generational trauma you should not have children. If you aren\u2019t ready, willing, and able to provide care for a child you regret having you definitely should not have children. Being a parent is the default, childfree wasn\u2019t even a term I had heard of 10-15 years ago. The closest concept I had was being the old spinster/crazy cat lady and that was definitely not a good thing. So if your sister is making you question any of this she\u2019s doing you a favor, now you get to make an informed decision instead of blindly following tradition and biology. Don\u2019t be mad at her because she inspired you to do some critical thinking.", "YTA, and she's right you can't think for yourself.

Tell him not to play with the leaf blower, hell just say \"I'm not I'm just touching it.\" Any and all rules like that he will argue. The youngest 1.5F I'm pretty sure is possessed or something. I have never heard a child scream like this one before. Sometimes I'm convinced her head is doing 360 rotations and she's trying to summon satan himself. They're not bad kids, but they sure are a handful, seeing how my SIL never gets sleep and how they constantly have to be on high alert when the kids are awake does seriously put me off having kids.

Now my baby is three months old and I don't regret having her for a second, but I was never 100% sure I'd feel that way.", "The best part is: I know tons of childfree people that would be happy to talk about the joys of parenthood with you. I myself love making kodak-moments with (most of) my little nibblings. I'm proud at their accomplishments. I'm proud of my cousins for being great parents (mostly). \n\nIt's really not hard to see both sides. \n\nBut when you come at us trying to convince us to have kids: we defend ourselves. \n\nIf OP hadn't been so pushy all this time, these conversations may have been much more fun and relaxed all these years.", "Yep. I did want kids, but wound up infertile. So I have some extra baggage there, especially as the children-are-mandatory lot are apparently incapable of not arguing with me about my own damn body.\n\n\nBut I'm totally with you on the Kodak moments thing, I have a brilliant nephew too. Not tiny anymore though, he's five and is definitely going to be taller than me! Making wonder for a child, or safety, or hope, or just making them laugh until they squeak, is one of the best things ever. And it is awfully nice to be able to hand them back, afterwards.", "My second is a cleft baby! Like you said, it's a minor and treatable issue IF you can afford the medical care but quite devastating if you can't!", "Why not tell them all the bad things that can happen?  You have to be told of all those things when you have surgery so you can make an informed choice.  Why hide the side effects of pregnancy?  So women can be tricked into getting pregnant?", "I\u2019m probably going to hell for this. My first born was the perfect baby. She\u2019s 14 and still amazing. None of the teenage fights I was warned about. Never wanted a second. Ended up with a baby boy who was born terminally ill. The things we went through were awful. I miss him every day and wish I could have him back. But at the same time, I\u2019m really glad it\u2019s just my daughter and me ( I know I\u2019m awful for saying that).", "My mom recently told me how she wanted a bigger family, and my dad was on board, but they decided they were done after I was born. From what I can remember of me as a little kid, I totally get it. The best part was that she waited until after my own kid was born to tell me\ud83d\ude05", "Rasing a mini version of yourself is fun sweet loving but when you argue about stuff you argue\u2026 my sweet mini me is 5 I dread her being a teenager. But husband has a unique way with her that means he stops us spiralling. \n\nMy first born made me realise I was a great mum. My second born made me realise never to judge another parent ever for the choices they make.", "As a mum of 3. I really relate to the \"I don't understand screech and point\" the whole circus of \"is it the duck....the pacifier....blanket???\" While making a big pile of everything that was in the pointed direction \ud83d\ude02", "I do think there's a big difference between being happy with any potential situation and being able to live happily with most likely situations. I have 3 kids, one has ADHD and one has a cleft, and I am certainly happy with my life and my kids. If one of them had a genetic disease which meant they couldn't live without severe pain or something like that, then I couldn't be happy with that and I think that's ok.", "Quit it with the disgusting belittlement.\n\nYour kids are adults. They don't owe you anything. They didn't ask to be born. If they do anything for you, it's because they WANT to, not because you 'make them'. FFS.\n\nThe way you talk about your kids is gross. My parents at least respected me as a human being.", "My mom told me one day my brother had told her half the things I got in trouble for as a kid were his fault. Nice.", "Why are you picking nits?  If they want to live at home, then they have to participate in home live.  Hence \u201cmake\u201d.  Of course, they are just as likely to casually say, \u201cI made mum go to the mall with me, because\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd, yes, kids and parents owe plenty to *each other*, once the kids are adults.   It goes both ways.", "YTA. those r ur own insecurities. you should\u2019ve thought of the points she brought up before you even started trying", "This. It took my relatives years to accept that I won't have children even though I am married to a man and have said that we're childfree. And they weren't even particularly insistent.", "Isn\u2019t that the last thing people say though? \u201cWhen you find the right man you\u2019ll want kids!\u201d But you\u2019ve got the man and you\u2019re both \u201cthat\u2019s a no for us dawg.\u201d And people still don\u2019t believe you \ud83d\ude02", "Not only that, but OP is doing the same exact thing to the sister. \n\nWhat if the sister started to doubt her decision not to have kids and blamed it on OP? \n\nWould OP be mad at the sister if the sister said it was OP's fault?", "Your comment added so much. It\u2019s okay to second guess the decision to have kids and it\u2019s okay to not be 100% sure.", "That\u2019s a good question, I am going to ponder deeply why people don\u2019t know the realities, again not to deter them but to know the realities so they can get above and beyond as healthy as they can be.", "My little brother was like this, he was the reason my parents stopped at 3, they didn't want to risk another him. Now he's married and his wife is baby crazy and works in daycare so she thinks she knows everything about raising kids. My daughter is just like him and my SIL gets frustrated that she won't sit still and be a perfect doll and thinks it's my fault from being a bad parent. Poor girl has no idea the calm, quiet man she married was a Tasmanian devil when he was little, and she's likely to have at least one that's just as bad. As it is my husband spent the first 18 months vehemently denying we would ever have another kid. We're almost 3 years in now and he still thinks I'm crazy but he's not completely shutting the concept down anymore. I keep telling him that we just got unlucky because we got my brother with the first one rather than the last.", "I'm the oldest, and why my mother went on to have 3 more I will never know. She still says I was harder than the other 3 combined, which I fully believe!", "Kids are not free labor, yes.  But they do need to be taught how to do basic chores so they can be self sufficient later. And if adult children and parents are living together, it\u2019s not \u201cmaking\u201d them do anything, it\u2019s not \u201cowing\u201d each other. It\u2019s cooperative living.", "My sister and I used to be like that, each looking at each other like \"YOU have children\"  \"No, YOU\". In the end neither of us have children XD", "Also, your abdominal muscles can just separate during pregnancy and then never go back to what they were (diastasis recti). Your feet get bigger, so do your hands, and you might get adverse reactions to your fetus like bilirubin poisoning.\n\nI'll forever maintain that human pregnancy is parasitic.", "Same, it's really tiring. \n\nWhen are you going to have kids?  I'm not\n\nYou will change your mind.  I won't\n\nWhy don't you want kids?  It's none of your business, I have my reasons and they are mine to know\n\nYou'd make beautiful children.  Probably, but that's not a reason to have them\n\nYou'll regret it one day.  Doubtful, I'll be busy doing all the things in my life I WANT to do\n\nYou still have time, you're not that old.  Thanks timekeeper\n\nWhat does your husband say about this?  Sigh, can we wrap up this inquisition I have things to do.", "YES! All of this. This is exactly what we go through as well. Keep fighting the good fight", "I love that one because that\u2019s assuming your child is financially responsible in any way and so far my brothers are my parents favorite and they are terrible with money! Relying on children instead of retirement accounts is why gen x wont get to retire at all!", "Lol, feel free to use that one if you want; it's saved me from plenty of unpleasant interactions about having kids :)"]}
