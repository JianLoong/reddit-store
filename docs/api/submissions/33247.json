I,on the otherhand, am not american. I will follow my traditions and have \"godparents\", i.e. a couple. So a maid of honor and a man of honor if you wish. For my bf this no issue as he will proceed with the guys but in church he will have his best man and his sister posing as godparents. \n\nHere is the issue. He has 9 guy friends in the wedding party and they organized a bachelor party a few days before the wedding. They will be travelling to my country and bring their so's and found out my maid of honour organized my bachelorette during these days as well, the event is going to be pretty cool, and several of the guys asked if their so's could participate. \n\nI said no. It is something for close friends and family members. One  of them called me and said that i could be more accomodating of my bf traditions and have their so's as bridesmaids and include them in the bachelerette. I told him no. He still wanted his gf and the others to be a part of the party. Of theirs so's only two, which are close and good friends, will be attending the wedding. As i said, small wedding. So i told him no again. \n\nThis is an issue because a few of them want / need to bring their gf/wifes and think they should attend. My bf is standing with me but his family is split. Our wedding is having 40s guest, just close family and close friends, so adding 7 so is going to increase the cost a lot and i want a small intimate party!

I agree that it's reasonable for your bachelorette to be people you care about but consider this. These nine guys are your husband's best friends.

Why are you being attacked? Why isn\u2019t your partner handling his side of individuals? This leads to my next question: Are you sure your partner is not throwing you under the bus and blaming you on his friends, even if he agrees with you? Did you send out invitations that included no plus ones? More information is needed. \n\n\nIt is not your job to be the communicator and your partner needs to stand up for you and be in control of this. I will also say that many would deem it in poor taste to have individuals part of the wedding party, without inviting spouses. It also does not help that it is a destination. Your partner also needs to understand that friendships will be lost and should be happy that people have not already dropped out of the wedding.", "YTA for not inviting them to the wedding.

That is messed up.\n\nThe other people then writing you and telling you horrible things are just assholes in every sense of the word. That is always a horrible thing to do. Flying monkeys.\n\nBut... it is the situation you are in. The only ones that really need to be happy with this in the end are you and your husband. You need to sit down and have a conversation about what you want to do and realistically look at the costs in friendships and make sure he is willing to pay that price... because he is the one who will lose friends over this, not you.

It\u2019s really that simple. \n\nShe\u2019s so focused on her traditions and what she wants, it seems she doesn\u2019t even care what the groom wants. It\u2019s not all about her.", "Okay. So where are the 9 groomsmen coming from and why are they even having a bachelor party at this point?", "I think you made a typo but just checking to see if the wedding really includes boats or not.", "The seats are limited.  OP is inviting 40 people to the wedding.", "Just his bros. He doesn\u2019t give a shit.", "Boats would be glorious. Typo unfortunately.", "They have a ridiculously large bridal part for such a small guest list. Way out of proportion.", "That doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t add more. There\u2019s no indication that they are limited to only 40. Just that\u2019s who they\u2019ve invited.\n\nIt is rude to invite one half of an established couple to a wedding. You invite both or neither. \n\nHow would she like it if, once married, only her spouse was invited to something? You know damn well she\u2019d be pissed. This isn\u2019t any different considering not everyone wants to get married. \n\nYou\u2019re hung up on these 40 seats as though its not a number that they created. It wasn\u2019t created by someone else.", "Okay! I think he is wrong for not giving a shit because now his fiance is being harassed and tormented because of his friends and their partners. OP\u2019s husband better get on board and put his foot down or I would be questioning the person I marry.", "Couldn't agree more.", "Yeah, he\u2019s wrong. But doesn\u2019t give a shit!"]}
