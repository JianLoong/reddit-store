I have literally had my REAL ID confiscated three times in the past year because clubs and bars just didn't believe I was really in my 20s. \n\nMy son attends a daycare from 8am to 5pm daily. My husband (30M) usually handles pick up and drop off, but last Friday an afternoon class I was supposed to have at college was cancelled, and I was missing my baby so I went to go collect him early to spend some time with him. \n\nWhen I got there, another parent, Melissa (34F) was there to collect her daughter, and as we were both coming a few hours early, we were waiting in the playground for a bit for the staff to bring the children out. I'm currently 6 months pregnant now and showing a bit, so she asked me if I was picking up a younger sibling, and mentioned that I looked too young to already have a child. I laughed it off and told her that I was 22 and picking up my son. She didn't believe that I was in my 20s, and I'm obviously not going to pull out my ID to show to a random woman, so I told her that I was definitely in my 20s and tried to end the conversation. She began to ask me questions about what I do for work, if I finished highschool, if the father had 'run off' and I gave her short answers. Throughout this conversation, she would keep shaking her head in a disapproving way and it was really upsetting as I usually avoid the daycare because of fear of something like this happening, especially since it's a Christian nursery (my husband is a Christian). \n\nThis Monday, my husband felt sick in the afternoon so I went to pick our boy up again, and I was informed by one of the staff members that Melissa had been talking about me to other parents, saying that she didn't think it was right for people to have kids so young, and about her not believing that I am an adult. I was irritated, especially given the community the daycare catered too because it could escalate to my son being ostracized by the other children, so I filed a formal complaint with the office just so Melissa could be officially told to leave me alone. \n\nYesterday, Melissa stayed behind to talk to my husband, and told him that she was offended I had filed a complaint for 'being concerned'. She also made a cryptic post on Facebook about the 'younger generations' being rude and ungrateful. My husband doesn't think I was wrong for being annoyed, but he thinks that my filing a complaint was unnecessary as I rarely ever go to the daycare, and now the situation could escalate because of gossip which could make things difficult for my son.

The will judge you for having kids not having kids working not working. Ignore them. You were well within  NTA realm filing a complaint.", "NTA. Also get your son into a new daycare.", "NTA I am mad for you. Judgy moms are horribly annoying in general, but then to post it on FB as if people couldn't figure out the dig and to top it off- she tattled to your husband instead of talking to you directly.\n\nPS. I agree that you should explore a different daycare. Being a mom is tough enough as it is and you can't change what people think but you can put your child in a daycare where you are comfortable", "NTA at all.  Doesn't matter if you were 16 years old and picking up your kid.  It's none of Melissa's business, and you certainly shouldn't be subjected to interrogation by another parent when just picking up your child.\n\nGossiping about you to other parents is more stupid, juvenile nonsense.  I'd file another complaint about her not knocking it off and bothering your husband with it.  Melissa can take her \"concern\" (read: judgement) and stick it where the sun doesn't shine.", "NTA. She's rude, intrusive and judgemental. She sounds awful. She wasn't concerned, she was nosy and unpleasant.", "NTA - Your original conversation was uncomfortable.  OK, you left it alone, good for you.  She then starts talking about you negatively to other parents?  If that were me, I would have been filling out that form the instant I knew what was going on.  You are absolutely in the right here.   You probably need to explain it this way to your husband as well.  Sounds like he doesn't want to be in the middle of it, but this is a case where he needs to be on your side.", "At 34 she\u2019s a fucking millennial.

It sounds like you've had to deal with this kind of infantilizing shit a lot, so he should really know better.", "NTA - How bored and pathetic is that woman?", "NTA. Melissa is a busybody. She isn't concerned. She's looking for a juicy story to gossip about. Unfortunately, because you complained, she has a new story to run with. She's got nothing else to do with her time and that's what you can tell people.", "NTA - FFS Its never you being the asshole for calling people out their shitty behavior. That really is a form of victim blaming and needs to stop.", "NTA Melissa needs to mind her own business.  What was she \"concerned\" about?  You're a grown adult.  \nThe staff there informed you of the problem, so I think it was fine to make the complaint.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou went by the book and should not second guess yourself on this.  If some BS comes of it and your child receives some crap as a result, imagine if you didnt file a report, then all these people would get this innocent face and ask, why didnt you tell us?  Man I hate hypocrites.\n\nThe only advice I would offer is next time this conversation starts with someone else, immediately put your phone to your ear, say excuse me and walk away like you got a call.  Just like hanging up on someone using airplane mode, but in person.\n\nWhat sucks is now Melissa is projecting her silly narrow minded games with others.  Good for the daycare to let you know she was talking crap and good for your husband for having your back.  \n\nGood Luck", "NTA.  Your age and when you decide to have tour children is none of her business.   She was completely in the wrong.  Being \"concerned\"does not entail running around gossiping and someone and something you have no complete knowledge of.", "Ummm, how old were you when you started dating your (8 years older) husband?", "NTA - She had no right to question you or gossip about it.", "ESH. Melissa was out of line, absolutely. Still, the two of you aren't children at the daycare - they aren't responsible for the behavior of the adults that cross their door. I think you could have handled or ignored Melissa yourself without making this a Thing for daycare staff to have to handle.", "Soft ESH. What were you hoping the complaint would accomplish? Other than speaking to the parent the daycare really can\u2019t stop people from talking and gossiping especially since your child hasn\u2019t had any negative experiences with the other children and no disruption of the class has taken place. Plus if it\u2019s true you rarely go to the daycare then it\u2019s easy to avoid that parent and any others like her so I fail to see the point in a complaint. That said I do understand wanting to put that judgmental ass parent on notice that you wouldn\u2019t tolerate being a topic of messy conversations with other parents. She had no right to judge and posting on Facebook is just pathetic mean girl behavior. You weren\u2019t wrong for wanting the behavior corrected. If it continues and does begin to affect your child then you are well within your right to push for intervention with the school. Personally, I would\u2019ve confronted the lady and handled it on my terms but that\u2019s just me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This asshat lady was judging you to your face. Your beauty and youthfulness broke her brain. lol.    Not all moms are like her.  If you MUST interact with her again, I suggest just telling her how she made you feel, and you may have overreacted, but everyone gets a pass. Now you both used up yours.   She will be a distant memory soon.. fuck her.   Or your boys will become bffs and in that case , she's gotta respect you for calling her out on how she made you feel.
