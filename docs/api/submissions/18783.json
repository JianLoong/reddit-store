Not worth a ruined friendship over.", "NTA. I agree that being asked to return a gift is tacky, and I'm glad you decided to rise above and return it to save your friendship.", "NTA\n\nA gift is a transfer of ownership from one to another. At the point she gave them to you they are now your belongings and you are free to do what you want with it. You could have sold them, modified them or even burned them as they are your property. \n\nA etiquette of gift exchanging does not allow for a gift to be taken back without prior agreement. Think gifting someone a car to use while theirs is out of commission. Without an agreement it is a reasonable expectation that the gift is yours do with as you wish.\n\nYou can give it back if you want but are under no obligation.", "Yes, it\u2019s tacky of her to ask but I suspect she\u2019s already upset with herself about having put back on the weight she lost and now can\u2019t find or afford a similar item that fits her. Even though you\u2019re in the right it would be unkind to tell her so, which would make you TA.\n\nI can sympathise with the wretch of giving up a garment that has such positive effects on your self esteem. Before you return it, can you take it to a seamstress or tailor and see if they can make a copy for you? -get a different colour made, you will cherish a great dress in your favourite colour even more than a black one.", "I agree asking for a gift back is tacky. But how badly do you want to retain this friendship?\n\nThere are times when being right isn't necessarily going to make you happy. This could be one of those times. Only you know how much the friendship means to you. If it's that important to you, I'd let my annoyance go and not say anything. But if her tacky request is going to eat away at you, long after you've returned the dress, then say something. But be prepared to lose the friendship over it.\n\nYou're NTA whichever way you go.", "NTA, but don't bring it up. Nothing good will come of it if you do. Let it slide and buy yourself a pretty dress.", "YWBTA\n\nYes, it *was* tacky to ask for the dress back, but it would *also* be tacky to point that out to her.\n\nIf you're not willing to ruin a friendship over a dress, why ruin a friendship over a *remark* about asking you to return the dress?", "She probably views you as a good enough friend, that \u201cit doesn\u2019t hurt to ask\u201d. I mean how many times we see that exact sentence on Reddit? In theory you could say no. And she would be TA to complain because it was a gift.\n\nHowever, this is an opportunity for you to do something nice for your friend. Why withhold that if you can buy a new dress that\u2019s similar? Or search out eBay/Poshmark for this exact same dress?\n\nI personally would just give the dress back and be privately annoyed.\n\nTechnically NTA\u2026 but it would likely damage the friendship b/c she be hurt and all the points you made to us about being able to get a different dress, she would also be thinking.", "NTA and I agree with you but it wouldn\u2019t be worth it to me personally to have this conversation unless you decide you\u2019re not returning the dress. Either way it\u2019s a little bruise on your friendship, hopefully you can move past it and have more good interactions.", "YWBTA. You said it. She can\u2019t afford new clothes. You can. A friend would give everything back in this situation.", "YWBTA for saying something, just give her the dress back because I'm sure she's feeling terrible about gaining the weight back and doesn't need to be reminded about that. Buy a new dress and keep the friendship.", "If you feel strongly that you want to say something otherwise it will fester in you, you can always say \u201cdo you want to swap back everything, all the dresses you gave me and the clothing for daughter that I gave you?\u201d  It makes the point in a direct way but doesn\u2019t call her out for this one contested dress - and it gives her the option of getting everything back that she might need now, it unwinds the deal entirely so no one feels taken advantage of which is where I think you are. \n\nYou are damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t - you either keep it and feel guilty or give it back and feel taken advantage of.", "NTA.. I'm pretty sure it's considered universal etiquette to not ask for a gift back", "NTA but if you want to keep the friendship, best not to tell her how you feel about it. I wonder if she actually feels like she has such a close relationship with you that she is comfortable with exchanging or sharing clothes like this? Like sisters might do? I don't know but just be an explanation for the unusual behaviour.", "NTA But you're trying to salvage your friendship.... I've got news: you're not friends. This person is using you.", "Return the dress, but don't ever accept gifts from her again", "NTA - asking to return a gift is strange, but you're right, it's not worth ruining a friendship over. take it as a lesson learned with her.", "NTA  Asking for the dress back after such a lopsided trade is rude! Five dresses for three bags of children's apparel? What a bargain! She probably sold the excess to a consignment store or on Marketplace. You don't care!  But is it worth sacrificing a friendship over? No. Give her the dress back. And don't conduct any more transactions with her. If you give her a gift,  great! She probably won't be gifting you again since you called her tacky for asking for her gift back.", "I don't think YTA, but sometimes we have to let things slide. My friend once gifted me a dress. I was so excited because I'm a heavy girl and it looked very nice on me, and she had two of the same. She called me that night to say that even though she had two of the same dress, she loved it and wanted it back. I remember being slightly ticked off and thinking she was being ridiculous, but I reminded myself that she is an excellent friend with a very big heart and blowing up about it wasn\u2019t worth it", "YWBTA\n\nIf it was a birthday gift or something then sure.\n\nHere though, it seems that she wanted to make sure that a dress that she clearly really loved got some use. But she really loved that dress, and she wasn't expecting to put on the weight.", "YWBTA, Even though I agree that asking to return a gift is quite disrespectul. However, I think a friendship is more important than a dress or a disrespectful thing she asked. Bringing that up can cause some arguments and I would father avoid that", "YWBTA because, as you stated, it's not worth to ruin a friendship over a dress, so just let it go and don't mention the (unquestionable) tackiness.

Were they actually given for a birthday or another occasion? Or were they merely hand-me-downs? This would make a difference on the tackiness meter for me. I think friends are allowed to be a bit tacky with each other. She knows it's not cool to ask for it back which is why she's just asking for that particular one (for the reasons you stated, it fits well and is versatile). But it also sounds like this wasn't gifted for an occasion but just a donation your direction because she couldn't use them anymore...and unfortunately now she can.", "That is a brilliant Idea! Thank you, I will ask her, if it is okay for her if I keep it just a bit longer to get a copy made.", "This is a very thoughtful response and helpful suggestion. I hope it works out for OP.", "Yes, this !\n\nHer request to return the dress was inappropriate.\nAs you have decided to honor her request to be a good friend, pointing out her faux pas would also be in bad taste. \n\nYWBTA. Returning the dress and not saying anything is the most polite move here.", "Just to clear this up: we both gained the same amount of weight (10kg).", "I never considered it a 'transaction'. I just pointed out that she received something from me as well to explain that her gift was not onesided. I don't care what she does with the stuff she got from me. I gifted it to her because I knew her daughter liked the same clothes that mine liked and also I did want to spare myself the hassle of selling them. It was a gift from me and I know that she sold some of the stuff after her daughter was grown out of it. I don't mind.", "Why am I selfish? I have supported this friend emotionally through many difficult times. She received much more from me than I got from her. All the while I fully support myself financially as a single mother while she has the luxury of only working part time while her husband provides for the family. What exactly makes me selfish?", "Then does the dress even fit you anymore?", "Life happens and it sucks that weight has to fluctuate like it does, but if she doesn't bring up the weight gain when you give the dress back there's no reason to bring it up either.", "Exactly! But even though she got so much stuff from you, she still needs that one dress back. Well, it's her worldview that things are important. Give her the dress back and find a new one you like with a classic style so you can wear it forever. But you're not an AH for telling her that asking for the dress back is tacky. If your friends won't tell you your behavior is weird, who will?", "The more you speak about her the more it makes it clear you aren\u2019t her friend.", "It does. It actually is a maternity dress, but does not look like one. It is very comforting and hides the gained weight.", "What matters more, the dress you said you can easily replace or the friend?", "I suppose the friend thought the same thing and already picked the dress.

So yeah, YTA is you don't give it back.", "YTA\n\nMy opinion would be different if she bought this for you as a gift.\n\nBut it\u2019s a hand-me-down and *she\u2019s just asking.*\n\nIf you\u2019re not willing to return it, just decline and say it\u2019s become a staple of your wardrobe.\n\nIf you\u2019re actually close friends, you shouldn\u2019t begrudge her being honest about wanting the dress back.", "NTA.  Ask for the kids clothes back, since you\u2019re returning 1/x of the dresses, as for 1/x of the clothes so hopefully she\u2019ll see why it\u2019s rude and tacky.", "NTA, it's tacky\n\nbut as a well-endowed woman, I can understand her struggle and pain. Finding clothes IS A LITERAL NIGHTMARE. either it fits the chest and looks like Omar the tent maker made it or it fits everything else and suffocates you. That's not your problem, I get it. But it's a big one that a lot of people don't seem aware of. The clothing market is not made for everyone... The clothing market is made for skinny people with B cups... or plus sized with K cups... there's virtually no inbetween. and i know it's hard cuz I'm an inbetween size too plus well-endowed.\n\nI understand, yes. It's tacky, yes. But for her, it's necessary.", "NTA I would never dream of asking for clothes back that I'd given away", "YWBTA - you said yourself you can afford a new one, and it's easier for you. There's no need to rub that in. I think it would be a bit tacky as it may have taken a lot of courage to ask again, stay friends, and the world needs it.", "NTA definitely say \u201cif you really need the dress you gifted me back that bad, I will return it, but I find this so tacky and unusual to ask for a gift back.\u201d I\u2019d love to know her response. You\u2019re right it\u2019s beyond odd to ask for something you gifted back.", "YWBTA. Just give the dress back. She doesn't need your admonishments. Don't accept gifts of clothing - or anything else that has been used - from her in the future.", "Shared custody?", "Sounds like she can't afford it. I would just leave it. I don't think she feels happy about asking you to return her dress. It seems she's asking out of necessity.", "YWBTA. Although it is an odd, and uncomfortable  request, your first instinct is correct. Give her back the dress and shut up about it. It's not worth losing a friend over, it you care about her.", "Nta but i wouldnt say anything if you value the friendship. Not a battle to pick.", "NTA. It\u2019s a bit strange to ask for a gift back a year later.

Your friend does not have a firm grasp on basic manners. Normal people don't do that.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt is really tacky.

That's not just money, that's time and effort. You're a better person than me, I'd have probably said no and kept it, because she literally gave it to you and she's got some big balls asking for it back.", "How did she ask?
