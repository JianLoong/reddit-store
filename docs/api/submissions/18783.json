At the point she gave them to you they are now your belongings and you are free to do what you want with it. You could have sold them, modified them or even burned them as they are your property. \n\nA etiquette of gift exchanging does not allow for a gift to be taken back without prior agreement. Think gifting someone a car to use while theirs is out of commission.

But even though she got so much stuff from you, she still needs that one dress back. Well, it's her worldview that things are important.

She just decided she wanted it back and asked. She did not really think about how I might feel about that. This sounds terrible. She is not a bad person, she is just often so preoccupied with depression and trauma that she is not able to see other perspectives on situations. We share a similar background regarding the trauma, but we do have rather different ways to deal with it. She often expects others to cater to her needs and tends to think that the world owes her something.", "I do not want to stoop to that level.

No one can tell their reaction.", "She doesn't own the pattern of the dress, but sometimes it can be worthwhile to just be a nice person by being earnest and upfront with your friends.", "There are several reasons. Her behaviour is often not understandable for people who have never faced trauma or depression. She tends to behave like a stubborn child if she does not get her way. Part of the problem is also that she is not working full time, which is not very accepted in the area where she lives. Also mental health issues are regarded as lazyness in the area.  Shitty situation but her behaviour is not helping at all.", "She is not aware of her behaviour being sort of entitled or bossy.

As I am able to drive and it is logistically easier for me to get to her than other way around she just expects me to drop it off. \n\nShe needs the dress in 3 weeks for a family event.", "This is something I have been considering in the past, as there has always been a disbalance within the friendship. And while I can see that, I also feels wrong to me to evaluate a friendship in this way. (It feels rather capitalistic to consider the value of a friendship.)

Let\u2019s take your example here, it is easier for you logistically because you drive etc. but that still doesn\u2019t give her the right to demand it.

Has she done this before and how did she ask. \n\nIf she hasn\u2019t done this before then I would give her some grace and just give back the dress and let it go.
