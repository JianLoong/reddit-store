{"id": 13126, "submission_id": "120zrhw", "title": "AITA for standing up to my wife after doing household chores?", "selftext": "For as long as I can remember, my wife has been very critical of the way that I've done household chores. Whether it's cleaning, cooking food, or doing laundry, it seems like my wife is always yelling at me and nitpicking. It's bothered me for a long time, but I eventually did what she wanted. However, last night I finally gave her a piece of my mind.\n\nWe were cleaning our place after dinner. She was cleaning the bathrooms, and I was cleaning the living room and the kitchen. I decided that I would simply use disinfecting wipes to clean the surfaces, since they're quick and easy to use. There was a program on TV that I wanted to watch anyway. Well, I finished up in the kitchen and plopped down on the sofa to watch my show. My wife came in and told me that I hadn't properly cleaned and that I needed to go over it again.\n\nI told her that I had cleaned it and that she was being a perfectionist like usual. She got really angry at me and told me that demanding basic cleanliness without streaks isn't perfectionism. I laughed and told her that she lacks self-awareness, and if streaks are so important to avoid, she was free to clean the kitchen again her way. She became furious and said that I was being purposely dense and unwilling to learn how to do the task right.\n\nI told her that she was being condescending and that perhaps she should seek professional help for obsessive compulsive disorder if she was unable to handle some streaks. I mean, it wasn't like I wiped everything down with a dirty rag. These were disinfecting wipes I'd purchased from the grocery store. I felt proud of myself for standing my ground, but my wife said that I was being a total jerk and mean to her. I reminded her of her mother's mental disorder, for which she has been in therapy for years, but my arguments didn't seem to matter and may have even made things worse.\n\nMy wife slammed the bedroom door shut and locked it, forcing me to sleep on our extremely uncomfortable sleep sofa. Her extreme overreaction has caused me back pain and a horrible night of sleep, and I'm afraid she still won't see things my way even after we talk this evening. I just want her to understand that she is behaving like a big bully, but I'm afraid that she is too narcissistic to ever admit to this, and I just don't know what to do.

Whether it's cleaning, cooking food, or doing laundry, it seems like my wife is always yelling at me and nitpicking. It's bothered me for a long time, but I eventually didn't what she wanted. However, last night I finally gave her a piece of my mind.\n\nWe were cleaning our place after dinner. She was cleaning the bathrooms, and I was cleaning the living room and the kitchen. I decided that I would simply use disinfecting wipes to clean the surfaces, since they're quick and easy to use. There was a program on TV that I wanted to watch anyway. Well, I finished up in the kitchen and plopped down on the sofa to watch my show. My wife came in and told me that I hadn't properly cleaned and that I needed to go over it again.\n\nI told her that I had cleaned it and that she was being a perfectionist like usual. She got really angry at me and told me that demanding basic cleanliness without streaks isn't perfectionism. I laughed and told her that she lacks self-awareness, and if streaks are so important to avoid, she was free to clean the kitchen again her way. She became furious and said that I was being purposely dense and unwilling to learn how to do the task right.\n\nI told her that she was being condescending and that perhaps she should seek professional help for obsessive compulsive disorder if she was unable to handle some streaks. I mean, it wasn't like I wiped everything down with a dirty rag. These were disinfecting wipes I'd purchased from the grocery store. I felt proud of myself for standing my ground, but my wife said that I was being a total jerk and mean to her. I reminded her of her mother's mental disorder, for which she has been in therapy for years, but my arguments didn't seem to matter and may have even made things worse.\n\nMy wife slammed the bedroom door shut and locked it, forcing me to sleep on our extremely uncomfortable sleep sofa. Her extreme overreaction has caused me back pain and a horrible night of sleep, and I'm afraid she still won't see things my way even after we talk this evening. I just want her to understand that she is behaving like a big bully, but I'm afraid that she is too narcissistic to ever admit to this, and I just don't know what to do.
