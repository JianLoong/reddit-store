I agreed to allow Cassie to be dropped off at my house on her way to work. I also get her on the bus when it comes by at 8:30am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that Regina has been dropping her off at 6am in the mornings which interrupts my sleep. They knock on the front door upon arrival and I come to open it. I then go back to sleep on the couch in the living room while Cassie also sleeps on the other couch. We both sleep until my usual wake up time at 8am. However, the sleep disruption is enough to make me tired during my workday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've requested that Cassie come in using the key that I gave her. That would at the very least not force me to get out of bed and walk to unlock the door, which fully wakes me up and makes it difficult to fall back asleep. I will still know when Cassie comes in the door because I sleep right next to it and can hear her enter. My ex-wife refuses to make that concession and insists that they knock on the door, waking me up, and expect me to open the front door to let her in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegina says that it takes Cassie too long to use the key and it's so cold outside. She also complained that I take too long to get to the door, leaving them out in the cold for longer than they want to be. She said that I should be \"watching her\" anyway (meaning she expects me to stay fully awake after 6am) and that this is easier on me than going to Regina's apartment to pick up Cassie and go back to my house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think Regina's viewpoint is ridiculous. I am providing free child care during her parenting weeks. If I didn't open my home for Cassie to stay in the morning, she would have to go to a paid day care center. I think Cassie is old enough that she should know how to use a key and regulate herself enough to be independent while I'm asleep. With the both of us sleeping in the living room, it's really no different from any night time during my parenting weeks so I don't think it's necessary that I be fully awake at 6am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\n\\[Edited to fix paragraph spacing\\]", "created_utc": 1704498583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zli2n/aita_for_requesting_that_my_daughter_use_her_key/", "score": 313, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Thank you.", "I think it\u2019s worth it no matter what lol I don\u2019t ever want to go back to a regular lock and key", "Finger print scanners for the win.  I don't even have to enter a code, just rich the lock.", "In the state we live, the child support formula is determined by amount of parenting time and incomes. My ex-wife makes less income than I do so according to the formula she is entitled to child support. Unfortunately, the court does not factor that it was her lifestyle choice to be divorced and end our family.", "Yes. The schedule is arranged for the overnight stays so that it meets the technical definition of 50/50, but the overall schedule during the day puts a lot of extra on me and is really difficult on our daughter's sleep schedule as well. I feel bad for her. \n\nThere's no consistency either. On random days my ex decides she will have the afternoon off and pick our daughter up from school so it changes the consistent routine of the bus dropping her off at my house. I still generally do after school parenting every day, but we also got these random one-off changes to the schedule when my ex feels like it.", "Yes, all these inconsistencies are documented on the calendar and in notes. If she requests breakfast, I'll get up and make her something. But usually she is ok with no breakfast. I make her food every day after she gets home from school though.", "The more I think about it, the more I see it as a solution worth proposing. Given that such an outcome would cause her to lose her child support money, maybe that would be enough to get her to stop making a fuss about unlocking the door with the key.", "I agree, and that's what I've been doing all the way. I do much more than my required parenting time, and the time we have together is high quality. It's just that the schedule has crept an increasing amount of responsibility onto me and I'm at the point of burnout. All I am asking is a small concession - to come in the door using the key I provided so that my sleep isn't interrupted too badly because I've been so tired lately. My ex won't agree to that concession, even though they have used the key before.", "Is it that the child cannot do a key in a timely manner, or is it that the child opening the door with the key looks like going into her own home, whereas knocking on the door to wake up her father looks like her being a guest in his home?", "Most certainly.", ">  When I was in college, some of my best papers were written at 2 in the morning (the day they were actually   \n>  \n>due  \n>  \n>), when it was quiet and everyone else was asleep.\n\nExactly. You get it!", "That's the nuclear option \ud83d\ude14", "I'm sorry for the lasting impact your parents divorce has had on your life. That was not your fault.\n\nAnd I feel terrible for my daughter. If I did not volunteer to take on this additional morning parenting time, then she would be dropped off at some day care place under the care of strangers where she definitely would not be able to continue her sleep or enjoy any of the amenities of her home. \n\nAll I want is to just do this on my terms - which is that I get to sleep a bit more until my 8am bus ready alarm goes off.", "I'm not saying she should stand up to her mother. I'm just saying she should be comfortable using a key to unlock a door.", "He says in another comment that he sleeps on the couch by the front door and she usually lays down on the other couch.", "Were you never a kid left to your own devices on a Saturday morning watching cartoons and munching on cereal while your parents slept in? How sad for you.\n\nBy 9, a child can totally self-regulate time on their own for a couple hours while dad sleeps. The daughter isn\u2019t a toddler and should not be treated like one.", "It's hilarious.  If the genders were reversed, everyone would immediately be supporting the poster, and bashing \"her\" ex-husband for expecting her to give up sleep during HIS parenting time.\n\nBut because people on this sub love to immediately shit on father's (admittedly, plenty suck ass), they jump to conclusions.\n\nShe's being unreasonable.  He is trying to help her out during her custody time.  He's not asking for extra child support.  He's just trying to help her out.  And she's completely unwilling to compromise.\n\nSorry, no way around it.  And to be clear - when it's NOT your custody time - it IS Babysitting.  And you can search this sub to see plenty examples where it's called out.  It's just normally the guy expecting his ex-wife to look after the children on his custody time when it's not convenient for him.", "I didn't mention in this post that I take care of her in the evenings too after the bus drops her off after school. I've been doing that for the past 3 years. The morning routine was recently added and it's burning me out. Some mornings I do make pancakes, but the lack of sleep is killing me. I'm basically a full time parent with our daughter sleeping the night at my ex-wife's enough apartment to meet the technical definition of 50/50.\n\nThere are reasons that I stay up late. Much of it to do with income-generating work and not all leisure.", "Which sounds like only to sleep and on every second weekend. So maybe dad should just have primary custody instead of having to work around mom's schedule?", ">But I'm sure your ex-wife would come up with another reason you would need to get up and open the door.\n\nHaha yes you understand!", "When dealing with a high conflict co parent, legal paperwork is a must.", "She needs to just hire someone to help so she doesn\u2019t disrupt your daughter\u2019s sleep also. I moved to a new city, away from family, was widowed, and had to hire someone for the days that I had to be at work before my daughter went to school. I wouldn\u2019t want to disrupt her sleep for that. I think that\u2019s more important than anything else here.", "More relevantly, she isn\u2019t even doing her 50%.", "Document all of this and talk your lawyer immediately. If you're burning out imagine how your 9 year old feels.", "No breakfast shouldn't be an option, even if it's an apple or a granola bar or a hard boiled egg.", "Its a reasonable concession too, i dont know enough about your ex or the overall situation to really be able to give advice but i truly hope for the sake of you and your daughter that your ex is able to see reason soon. Burnout is hard enough without also being there for your kid and doing the bulk of the child care, not to mention your daughters brain is still developing a loooot and getting proper sleep cycles is important for anyone especially kids", "Thanks for your sympathy. The only reason I shared my personal experience is to express how devastating it can be to a child to not have a consistent schedule.\n\nThat's why I suggested you change your schedule. You can spend your time in the morning awake with your daughter and your ex-wife can let her sleep in the evening on her time allowing you and your daughter to get enough uninterrupted sleep. \n\nFailure to provide a consistent schedule and adequate sleep for your child on her part can be grounds for you to either gain full custody and/or cease child support.\n\nMake sure you communicate everything in email or text so you have written disagreements and proof that she is not putting her child's needs first if she fails to commit to and enforce an earlier bed time.\n\nThis way you can be the hero, spend more time with your daughter and get adequate uninterrupted sleep without lasting effects on your daughters development and ability to function long term.\n\nWishing you both the best!", "Are you sure she isn't and that isn't just a story she's telling because mom wants you awake? Maybe she is afraid to come into the house alone, while everyone is asleep.  Nine is older but still a kid.  Have you asked her? Maybe when you are in the car together and she doesn't have to look at you. She could be embarrassed...and having that space could open her up", "After he wakes up from his bed. Once his daughter arrives he goes back to sleep on the sofa.\n\nI did read the post.", "Strangely when my children were young I got up with them, made sure they were fed, brushed their teeth etc. 7 days a week.\n\nThis man wants to not even check if his daughter has arrived, he thinks at 9, 5 days a week she should fend for herself because he cannot be bothered to parent her.", "[deleted]", "Ok, that\u2019s not 50/50 custody. That\u2019s you having all weekday custody. She should just sleep at your house. It sounds like mom just doesn\u2019t want to owe you child support while you feed and house her during mom\u2019s \u201ccustody time.\u201d", "No judge will agree to that. Mediators will just ask parents to work together.", "That person would have to be compensated. It's possible we end up with a solution like that. If so, she will probably open a new litigation in court requesting more child support for it. Maybe that's the plan. This is why I have to document every encounter with her.", "I don't mean to open the scientific debate about it, but a lot of research doctors now say that breakfast isn't as important as we used to think. It makes sense - I never had an appetite first thing in the morning when I was a kid. There are apples and granola bars available, but she doesn't want them at that time.", "Yes, divorce is really sad. Kids lose the most in a divorce like this.", "Thanks for the idea. I'll try to have that conversation with my daughter.\n\nAs I've said in other replies, I don't mind if my daughter wakes me up to let me know she's home. I also don't mind if she watches the TV or plays video games on low volume. It's just that hearing the door pounding, standing up, walking, and getting a blast of cold air in my face makes it difficult to go back to sleep. Coming in quietly using the key is easier on me.", "Yup, these are things you\u2019re supposed to think about before you have kids.", "Most actually take the child into account. If the child doesn't need to get up at the ass crack of dawn to go to dad's house so she can get to school, then stay with dad until bedtime every day, the custody agreement isn't working for her.", "Great....and I completely get your issues. The Ex may like inconveniencing you so is 'influencing' your daughter not to use the key, which is unfortunate as you are only doing this due to a problem on her end. \n\nI hope the chat goes well and all is resolved.", ">The Ex may like inconveniencing you so is 'influencing' your daughter not to use the key,\n\nVery likely"]}
