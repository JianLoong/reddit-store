I've been doing a ton of sports for years, I exercise frequently and I'm in pretty good shape, but for the past (let's say) around two years, I've had horrible pains with my joints.\n\n My knees are in such bad condition that I have a lot of struggle bending my knees to shoot a basketball or diving to save a volleyball. I can barely jump in track and field without my knees popping and I have to sit out for 5 minutes. I also can't run well because of my knees and my ankles. \n\nTo top it off, my hips are also in bad condition. I can't stretch because when I do, my hip feels like it's about to dislocate and I have to quickly stop because when I do stretch my hip gets locked in place and I double down in pain. \n\nI haven't brought it up to my dad until today and he told me I was overreacting. He told me \"are you sure you aren't over thinking it and it's not just growing pain?\" Which I told him I was sure, because I haven't grown much at all in the last year. He then proceeded to tell me \"well, you're doing a lot of sports, maybe you aren't warming up enough.\" Even though I go through 25 minutes of warmup EVERY time I do ANY sports related thing.\n\nHe then told me I was just exaggerating my pain. I'm not. I feel like a grandma. My everything hurts so bad. He got me knee braces online a few weeks back when I told him that my knee hurt a 'little' and they've helped a bit but my coach told me I should consult a doctor if I use knee braces. I relayed this to my dad and he just doesn't believe me. \n\nSo I did what any distraught and angry teenager would do and I flipped out and yelled. I told him some really rude things about him which I take full responsibility for. I called him things about how he wouldn't understand because he never does activities like me. I told him he never did as many sports as me with the pains I did. It was far, but I was angry and I still am. I would never exaggerate about how excruciating the pain I am in was, and the fact that he made me feel like I was just overreacting made me livid. I yelled and yelled going on about his weight and his asthma and how even though he passed it onto me I still did sports.\n\nHe went to his room silent and now my sister is consoling him and telling me to apologize. She's siding with him saying that I'm being an asshole and I'm over exaggerating in order to get some attention. My brother is also siding with them saying that even if I was in pain I should've just dealt with it instead of lashing out. I'm still incredibly angry and I'm not apologizing for wanting to go to the doctors just to get my joints checked out. I want to continue doing sports and I can't if every step I take makes me want to break down crying. I do admit I went a little far insulting my dad but he wouldn't listen to me and he never will.\n\nTL;DR My dad told me I was over exaggerating about my joint pain so I called him some really nasty things and now he's sad and I'm mad.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: This was a bit of a rant, and I wanted to mention that I told him about everything in extensive detail. From where it started, how it feels, how my friends think about it, what I think about it, the research I've done on it and what my diagnosis is etc. Thanks for the comments so far, I appreciate what everyone's telling me.\n\nEdit #2: I'd also like to mention that I haven't been to the doctor in maybe 3 years. And that was because of something as horrible as now. He brought me then cause I pestered him for a month and I feel like I shouldn't have to, hence the reason I lashed out on him. I'm probably going to apologize when he wakes up.

Keep pushing that your coach has recommended seeing a doctor.\n\nAnd frankly you should be seeing a doctor every year for a physical anyway, even if you appear completely healthy. (It may be called a well child checkup - yearly checkups are good for everyone including pets, because there is a better chance of catching illnesses early.)\n\nStart documenting the instances of pain as well as what it feels like and what you were doing - the pattern and how often this pain is occurring is just as important.\n\nAnd it also means if your dad refuses to do anything, you\u2019ll have your own documentation when you can go to a doctor on your own.", "NTA - you should have been having regular checkups with your pediatrician all along.

Juvenile RA, lupus, Marfan, or any of a variety of diseases. EDS is fairly rare, but it gets diagnosised a fair amount because it can have so many different symptoms and manifestations making it easy to mistake for other things or for other things to be mistaken for it.

However, because of how similar a lot of the symptoms can be between some types, that\u2019s very unlikely lol. Like I said, rheumatology is a fine place to start and get an idea of what\u2019s going on, but a lot of them actually won\u2019t specifically diagnose hEDS and will refer to genetics anyways. I would not just ignore testing for other forms of EDS/genetic CTDs, especially if vEDS or Marfans are a possibility. \n\n\n\nDefinitely agree with your last point. Imo, hEDS is fairly over diagnosed. In part because doctors don\u2019t do the work of ruling other things out, I\u2019ve seen it happen a few times where people were diagnosed with hEDS for a while then found out they had vEDS or cEDS.\n\n\n**It could also be nothing.** Child athletes royally screw their joints without any medical reason all the time."]}
