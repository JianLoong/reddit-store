I don't know what culture you are from but I cannot imagine anywhere in the world where you would need to buy a 25,000 dollar car for a sister (or even a 1,000 dollar car for that matter), let alone give preference to that kind of support for your sibling instead of taking care of your own child.\n\nYou have a very strange family. You don't need to apologize. You need to get them out of your life, because they will ruin your family for the benefit of your sister. How dare they.", "NTA, do not give her another cent. She said terrible things about your son, and family. If your mom thinks your sister is, then mom can help her. Sis can go find a job or go after dad for child support.", "NTA and to be honest after what she said about your son I would 100% stop helping her. She isn\u2019t yours or your husbands burden. She can get a job. You\u2019ve helped her far more than most people would and she\u2019s so greedy and ungrateful. I can\u2019t even believe she would say that about your son. I\u2019m so sorry. She does not deserve anything from you any longer.", "NTA. Let me get this straight? Your family told you you were harsh? To a person who called your child abnormal? And thinks she is entitled to your money? And sounds like she wants your husband for herself? Goddamn cut them all off. None of them are your responsibility specially your entitled sister. Why tf is she popping out kids that she can\u2019t afford. She should learn her lesson that her kids are her responsibility not yours. You should stick to your guns, why tf would you even still consider helping this poor excuse of a human being after she\u2019s been so openly horrible to you and your child.", "NTA. Your sister decided to burn a bridge when she lashed out at you and became ungrateful for your incredible generosity.

Block every hateful person (if they want to help your sister, they can shell out the money themselves) and concentrate on your darling baby.\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for.

She should have thought about all the help you provide for her before she talked reckless to you. And honestly, I would go NC with her even if she apologized for how she spoke about your child. That's horrible to say to anyway but especially to a family member who is providing financial support for you. And she is just hugely ungrateful, not just for the things she said but the fact that she expected you to buy her a 25K car!

It has nothing to do with you, none of it is your fault and you definitely don't have to feel bad for bringing up the things you did.

You and your husband have been generous with her to the point she feels entitled to your money rather than grateful for the help you\u2019ve been giving her. Help you are not obligated to provide.  Your sister is in the wrong, and those family members who think you are should pool their money and buy her a car.", "NTA and everyone siding with this entitled twit can help her.

It is not your responsibility to ensure that your sister is financially able to care for her kids, regardless of how much more money you have than her. The fact that you've been generous to this point doesn't mean you have to continue, particularly in the face of her being abusive towards you when she doesn't get her way and inappropriate with your husband. She is an adult who chose to have children, it is her responsibility to care for them, not yours. Also, your family is entirely wrong - you were not both wrong in the situation. I definitely think that for your own mental health, some distance for the time being is probably a good idea. And when you do work things out, hopefully, some firm boundaries will be needed.", "NTA -   \nYou have nothing to apologise for.

Jenny deserves nothing. Jenny isn't her children though. It sounds like you've been really wonderful and supportive with your help for them, getting them accommodation but also enriching their lives.\n\nI'd just say take a child-centred-approach to this.

Obviously your sister feels entitled to everything that belongs to you and your family, which is awful. Worse though is her denigration of your son. That alone is enough to cut her out just so you can protect him. However I am most concerned about you, you sound physically and emotionally drained, can you and your husband look into hiring a caretaker of some sort to help you and help with your son?

She is using you. It needs to stop. Also if you are dealing with postpartum depression please seek help. It can be treated.", "Absolutely NTA, she is completely out of order.", "NTA\n\nAfter that comment, she'll be lucky to get any help at all from you.  You don't owe her anything.  Anyone in your family backing her can take over paying for her.\n\nThe fact that she's pissed off when you said no to giving her the $25k for a car says that she doesn't appreciate what you're doing for her at all.

I guarantee that your sister will at some point make moves on him, if she hasn't already. \n\nAnyone who talks about  a child- their sister's child, no less!- the way she did is the lowest form of life.

It's money all the way for them.\n\nNo one 'needs' a $25 000 car, either. If she's genuinely desperate she'd be happy with a $2 000 rattletrap. A $25 000 is a new, luxury vehicle.\n\nYour sister is a malignant narcissist and should be kept far away from your child and your husband. Find your backbone, protect your family, and get rid of her before she harms you any further. I strongly suggest looking at websites re: familial narcissists.

He needs to get on the same page because you guys are a team who don\u2019t tolerate disrespect. Discuss with him how your support and kindness has enabled and made sister feel entitled.\n4.

Stop letting them use and abuse you. You have a family now take care of them", "This is really hard for you. I'm sorry your having to deal with this.\n\nIt's not great that your husband just doesn't believe what happened because he wasn't there. Why does he think you are an unreliable narrator.\n\nWhether your husband is cheating or not I can't say, but your sister is behaving inappropriately and acting very entitled towards your husband. Even if your husband is being faithful he is still responsible for shutting your sister down and ending her behaviour.\n\nYou need to have a serious conversation with your husband about boundaries. You can say that she is acting inappropriately and so the 2 of you need to reinforce appropriate boundaries.\n\n My suggestions\n\n1)your sister is no longer allowed to visit your husband. If she shows up at his work, he tells her he is busy and sends her away. (If he has an assistant or someone between him and visitors, get them to send her away) Same for if she shows up at the house when she knows your not there.\n\n2)he should not have 1 on 1 conversations with your sister. No phone calls or texting. It isn't necessary the 2 of you are a team, so she doesn't need to talk to him behind your back.\n\n3)I understand that getting into a big fight with everyone right now seems so overwhelming. So have Jacob agree that continuing to indefinitely financially support your sister isn't happening. You will pay daycare fees for the next 3-6 months (pick whatever feels most realistic) but after that she needs to be supporting her self (she can get child support of her ex instead of your husband).  Stop buying extras like groceries or clothing (or a car!). Agree that you will no longer be your sisters atm. (What access do you have to yours and husbands finances? Will you be able to payment to day care has stopped? That large amounts of money aren't going out of the account?)\n\n4)discuss with your husband setting up some kind of trust or plan to support your baby through their whole life. The extra money from not paying for your sisters lifestyle can go there.\n\n5)do you need some help looking after the baby? Maybe a nanny or someone with medical expertise? Don't forget that you need a break too and you and your husband need time together. Even some help whilst you're at the house but they are looking after the baby would help. Or maybe some help with household stuff, like a cleaner \n\n6)it does seem that you and your husband need to work on some things like communication and being on the same page regarding handling disruptive family members. Couple counselling would be beneficial. Particularly as parenting a child with serious medical needs can be very difficult on a marriage.", "You need to find out what's going on.
