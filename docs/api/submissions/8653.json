My mum had a lot of impractical ideas how to share duties such as executives to estate. A lot of it was fear that one child would feel less loved if she didn't give them an equally important role. The reality is, all of us would step up if we had to but none of us actually want the roles and would have been happy for one of the others to handle it. But despite all of us telling her that, she had a real bug bear about it. It finally settled down when the lawyer suggested assigning one child executive, one power of attorney and one medical power of attorney. She felt that we each had an important role that showed she trusted and loved us all. She was a lot more reasonable than your mother to begin with but she was happy with that. If you believe your sister trustworthy despite your differences, suggest giving her power of attorney and you executive of the estate. Or vice versa. Emphasise how both are very important roles.\n\nAlso talk to your sister, lay out what your mother is demanding, why it is a terrible idea and offer her the choice of executive/power of attorney. She doesn't have to take on either.
