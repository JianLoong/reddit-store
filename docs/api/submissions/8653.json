I was already my dad's financial & medical power attorney, assigned by court because although my brother lived closer to my dad, the hospital suspected (were fairly certain)  my brother was financially, medically abusing my father so they reported him due to things such as taking my dad for surgery, not visiting while he was in hospital, not picking him up when he was discharged, having his pain meds filled (but leaving my dad in pain while he took all his meds), refusing to follow doctor's orders causing innumerable readmissions due to lack of proper care, and the list goes on.

My brother blew through the cash in a matter of months.  When i did a look back on prior finances, i found that over a 3 year period he had already taken over $75K from my dad's account as his health deteriorated and he was unable to check on his accounts.\n\nUnbeknownst to me until everything was said and done, i learned my 93 yr old uncle had told my brother he was aware that i promised my dad not to take any action that would cause my brother to go to jail for his actions,  but he had not made any such promise.

He can do all the work if he wants to."]}
