This conversation was had without my prior knowledge and in my experience coercive. \n\nSince our separation (we were not married) she has had several boyfriends most of which have been introduced to our children. Our original agreement on separation was that we would notify each other upon any major changes to our kids lives, new partners, living arrangements etc.  \nThis worked well for the first time she had a new partner, but has not been followed up since. In fact she moved in her husband(not husband at the time obviously )without telling me. And the kids felt guilty that they had not mentioned it when I found out. I did not tell my kids off for this i just laughed it off and said that it was nice to not make they feel awkward. \n\nBrief introduction to the new husband, I know absolutely nothing about him. I've tried to engage him in conversation on many occasions he just stuck to one word answers and eager to get away from me as soon as possible. I didn't even know his surname until my ex approached me to add it to the kids surnames via a double barrel.\n\nI was speechless, didn't give an immediate answer. She continued to tell me the kids are all for it. Rather than have an argument I said I would think about it. \n\nI have absolutely no intention of letting my kids change their surnames to add his. \n\n1. I believe the kids have manipulated into thinking it's a great idea. ( I used to be manipulated during our relationship, and she still does to a point now but I'm more aware now)\n\n2. When/if she splits up with her husband ( she has a history)my kids will be stuck with a stupid surname. \n\n3. Im not a fan of hyphenated surnames (double- barrel)\n      3.1 Also the names are not unique\n\nQuick background about myself since my separation I've had joint custody of our children and have been in a relationship with my now wife nearly 7 years. My children have known her most of there lives and they think the world of her, she has a good relationship with my Ex too. Despite having joint custody I pay child support as my and I'm suckered into paying more on occasion various ploys of which I won't get into here.....\n\n\nAnyway I feel like I've wasted your time.

Plus solicitors in Britain offer 30 minute free initial consultations and you can call as many solicitors as you like and get your free consultation from all of them. Best of luck,", "Kids born in Scotland?  If yes, then while you can call yourself anything you like it isn't a legal change and you generally can't get formal documents (passport/driving licence) without a birth cert or a statutory declaration (deed polls do not exisit here) in that name.\n\nThey may be called the double barrell, but that doesn't mean it's a formal legal change (at least not without the additional paperwork)", "And OP doesn't even need to make it a thing that's about gaslighting issues to ask her to start doing this. Just say \"We've had some mixups of dates, using this app will help make sure we all know what's going on and we reduce confusion\". I can't imagine she would have a leg to stand on if she tries to argue that they shouldn't use an app that's specifically made for coparenting arrangements - they're used by couples without gaslighting issues because coparenting is hard and there's a lot of balls in the air.", "THIS.  ABSOLUTELY, 1000000% this.\n\nI am not actually law enforcement trained, but I do have my criminal justice degree, and this is something I would highly encourage as well!", "OP is not US based", ">Try the legal sub, legaladvice sub, and I think there is one called legaladviceuk\n\nGetting legal advice anonymously over there Internet is a bad idea. No competent lawyer will ignore the major ethics issue of giving specific legal advice outside of an attorney-client relationship. Mostly what you get on those subs is a mix of overgeneralized boilerplate by non-attorneys engaged in a weird popularity contest, and even when they're wrong the mods will often delete the correct answer and ban the person posting the correction. It's happened to me, and it's happened to a number of actual attorneys.\n\n If you have a specific question, you need specific answers. Go see a real attorney in real life."]}
