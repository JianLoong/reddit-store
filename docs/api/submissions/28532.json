This conversation was had without my prior knowledge and in my experience coercive. \n\nSince our separation (we were not married) she has had several boyfriends most of which have been introduced to our children. Our original agreement on separation was that we would notify each other upon any major changes to our kids lives, new partners, living arrangements etc.  \nThis worked well for the first time she had a new partner, but has not been followed up since. In fact she moved in her husband(not husband at the time obviously )without telling me. And the kids felt guilty that they had not mentioned it when I found out. I did not tell my kids off for this i just laughed it off and said that it was nice to not make they feel awkward. \n\nBrief introduction to the new husband, I know absolutely nothing about him. I've tried to engage him in conversation on many occasions he just stuck to one word answers and eager to get away from me as soon as possible. I didn't even know his surname until my ex approached me to add it to the kids surnames via a double barrel.\n\nI was speechless, didn't give an immediate answer. She continued to tell me the kids are all for it. Rather than have an argument I said I would think about it. \n\nI have absolutely no intention of letting my kids change their surnames to add his. \n\n1. I believe the kids have manipulated into thinking it's a great idea. ( I used to be manipulated during our relationship, and she still does to a point now but I'm more aware now)\n\n2. When/if she splits up with her husband ( she has a history)my kids will be stuck with a stupid surname. \n\n3. Im not a fan of hyphenated surnames (double- barrel)\n      3.1 Also the names are not unique\n\nQuick background about myself since my separation I've had joint custody of our children and have been in a relationship with my now wife nearly 7 years. My children have known her most of there lives and they think the world of her, she has a good relationship with my Ex too. Despite having joint custody I pay child support as my and I'm suckered into paying more on occasion various ploys of which I won't get into here.....\n\n\nAnyway I feel like I've wasted your time.

That would allow you to get formal papers (passports etc) in that name.", "I don\u2019t think you should get their opinion before saying no. It\u2019s really your choice not theirs at this point. But you should open communication with them about the topic. If you go along with it and haven\u2019t talked to them OR don\u2019t agree then your ex will say that it was your idea or you think it\u2019s a great idea. OR you don\u2019t agree, you will be made the bad guy in the story. While I totally agree with not bad mouthing their mom to them, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to avoid talking about any topic with them that involves their mom. If she\u2019s as manipulative as it sounds, they\u2019ll grow up thinking you let her manipulate them and never protected them.", "The 7 years is how w long op has been marked to their current wife.", "\u2026.No. That\u2019s just not true. In the UK, you become an adult at 18, not 16.", "You may be on a bad situation with your ex, but how does that make OP T A? Are you serious? I don\u2019t have kids but I\u2019d never knowingly consent to letting my family name be erased from their identity if I did.", "I live in the same country as OP. So that's how I know how much she would pay", "I\u2019m in Scotland and have been on the other side of this (mum changing surname). In my case the kids dad gave up parental rights when we were trying to get contact sorted. Without anyone asking! Me and my lawyer nearly fell off our chair. I think he thought it meant no child support payments. Anyhoo\u2026.\n\nShe\u2019ll need your consent if you\u2019re on the birth cert and you have parental rights. Only you can give up those rights. She might make arguments about it being easier to go on holiday without being questioned at the border. It\u2019s much easier for you to give her a letter to show at the border granting permission for the kids to go on holiday. \n\nThis sounds very much like alienation and a few comments have mentioned using an app to communicate. This is a great idea and one I wish I\u2019d known about when it was me. AFAIK it\u2019s something used in Scotland now and the Sheriff / solicitors can see the chat history. Most importantly if you haven\u2019t already, get back in touch with the solicitor who dealt with the care agreement (custody isn\u2019t a thing in these situations in Scotland) and get the CSA involved to formalise the amount you pay in child support.", "Have a conversation with Citizen's Advice. Here's the link for the Scottish service. They can talk you through any legal consequences/your and your kids' rights. Don't agree to anything until you understand potential consequences.", "NTA. If you\u2019re in the UK and have Parental Responsibility then you can simply refuse the name change. She can ask the school to use the double barrelled name as their \u201cknown as\u201d name but she can\u2019t formally change it without your consent without a court order. The chances of her a) seeing that through and incurring the cost, and b) securing the order when you\u2019re v involved and against it, are slim. \n\nI would explain to the kids that names are important and that we thought very long and hard about the names we gave them when they were born. It\u2019s mummy getting married, and she\u2019s able to change her name if she\u2019d like to, but as they\u2019re kids both parents have to agree to big changes like this. Personally I would add that they still feel strongly at say, 18yo, I will support them changing it at that stage but not before. Tenner says they won\u2019t bother. \n\nIf your ex kicks off tell her if everyone\u2019s so keen on matching the kids you\u2019re cool with her and her fianc\u00e9 changing their names to your surname.", "Seek legal advice, Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau if you\u2019re skint: most have a lawyer donating their time to give you advice. Don\u2019t let your ex manipulate your kids\u2026 or you. Stop paying her too- you share custody so you owe her fuck all. Good luck from a fellow Scot", "This is not an amicable parenting situation. It\u2019s time to get everything spelled out by the courts as far as schedules, CS, etc and then don\u2019t deviate even a millimeter from that. I\u2019m assuming she needs your approval to change their surname so you should just say no to this (if they don\u2019t have your surname, you could offer to change it to your name or nothing). Communicate through an app designed for high conflict parenting so that her communication is all saved in case you need to go back to court. If she continues to try to alienate your kids against you, that is something to document and address through your lawyer \u2014 often it would lead to reduced parenting time for her", "Now you know his surname check him sex offender register, Claire\u2019s law (I think). There might be a reason they\u2019re being shady.", "Have a read up on dark triad of personality. Sounds to me that the children are not central to her thoughts here and that they (and you) are being manipulated and gaslighted. Gets your thoughts in order, discuss with your wife , consider chatting with a solicitor and have a think about setting some clear boundaries with your ex.\n\nBe aware that if you do she will escalate her behaviour ( for a while) but it will set clear limits on her behaviour going forward", "She never wanted *her* surname hyphenated when it was just the two of you together parenting the kids. But now that she\u2019s marrying this guy she suddenly wants to share partial surnames with them? Weird.", "OP, you\u2019ve gotten a lot of support here, but I want to add in as someone who once was the child in a similar scenario. My mom had a lot of boyfriends, but she was talking about marrying one and wanted to have him adopt us and change our names. My dad was an absentee dad, but he was still very much my dad. When it wasn\u2019t this conversation, she wanted us to take her last name (she went back to her maiden name after the divorce from my dad).  \n\nI still resent these conversations with hers, and I\u2019m a happily married adult with two teenagers of my own. I still resent it so much. It was awkward and difficult and seemed like we were stuck in a place of disappointing her if we said no (and possibly disappointing the man we thought she was going to marry). If we didn\u2019t disappoint her, we would be taking on a label we didn\u2019t want. \n\nI share all of this because it sounds like you have a\ngood relationship with your kids, and I\u2019m guessing they need an outlet right now. I really hope that outlet can be you. And I also hope, without any pressure from either of you, that your kids get to stick with the names they\u2019ve had since birth. \n\nGood luck!", "A double-barrel with his name and your name would make it seem as if the kids are his and *yours* (not his and hers). It's an absurd proposition.\n\nNTA", "Not in the UK.", "And said the kids had known her most of their lives", "We have our own legal system numb nuts. At 16 you\u2019re legally emancipated and can do whatever you want without your parents permission.", "Wrong, in England perhaps, but it's a separate legal system up here.  Certain things - alcohol or voting in a general election (edited: as holyrood has dropped this to a lower age form some devolved/local polls) - are 18 throughout the UK but that's about regulation of those activities, not adulthood.", "Are you going to make sure you never have daughters then, or teach them to never give up your family name if you do.

In the US everything costs more that should not.", "I was absolutely going to comment this. If she uses an app she has to put all dates for everything into a message. It is written down and she cannot argue about it.", "I think an app is an excellent idea. On those occasions where OP may actually have forgotten something he will have at least one written record to consult. Though I'd probably use a calendar too just in case. But an \"oh wow, I'm so sorry I forgot\" is about a million times better for an amicable relationship than being stuck not knowing if the other partner just made it up because he or she is selfish or does not want to admit that *they* forgot to mention it.\n\nAnd the name idea is obviously absurd, no parent who is involved in the kids' lives would ever agree to that.", "Or, as an alternative perspective, she feels settled in her current relationship and has found that she likes the idea of a shared familial name with her kids. Sure, her reasons could be suspect, but they could also be just a mom and her kids expressing what they would like to do.", "I was actually talking about the UK. You don't need ID to register with a doctor for instance.", "Even in the rest of the country its nuanced.  16 year old's can do a lot in the rest of the country too.", "Definitely agree with that. We don't even have to pay that, we can change our names ourselves by making our own document that's just signed by two witnesses that don't live at the same address as the person making it. Legal names really aren't a big deal at all in the UK", "That's the correct response for at least parts of the UK. Name changes must be done with consent of both parents with parental responsibility until the child reaches 16. I believe this is true for all, but there are quirks of each country and I've not looked into Scotland.\n\nI don't know the laws around assuming names, however. Adults can assume a name change upon marriage. It may or may not be that the kids can assume a double barrelled surname by choice without amending their name via deed poll, if one of the surnames in question is their mother's. I don't *think* they can, but I know a lot of kids that switched socially so I might be wrong.", "That's why I responded to the OP's post saying they're from Scotland with Scotland-specific advice. I'm not a yank but I don't believe that yanks let 16 year olds do anything except carry and shoot automatic weapons without their parents' or spouse's (if they're one of the many American child brides) permission.", "Even if that\u2019s true, she has no right to even think it would be acceptable for HIS KIDS to take their stepfather\u2018s name.", "And let's not even start with Gillick-competence...", "I grew up in England.  My mother had me while unmarried and did not put my father's name on the birth certificate.  She claimed she didn't know who it was.  When she decided to change my name to my stepfathers she still had to go to court and file papers swearing she did not know who the father was so he did not have to be asked for permission.  This was a lie but she did it.  This was 58 years ago but I bet it's still the same and likely the same in Scotland.  If the father is known I doubt she can change the kids' names without his permission.\n\nFYI I only found out who my father was through DNA on Ancestry.  Lots of family secrets coming out with DNA these days.", "Do her kids not currently share a last name with the stepmother? Unacceptable lol. \n\nIt would be weird if they had the mother's last name but they've already got OP's, so won't they just get one name from each household now?"]}
