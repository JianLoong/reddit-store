However, once I got married and had kids, my brother's grown increasingly distant over the last few years, and I couldn't understand why.

That was five years ago, and now that I have a daughter, my brother is more distant than ever.\n\nLast week, I went over to my brother's house to talk to him, hoping to figure out what was wrong and hoping to mend whatever caused this rift between us. I asked him what was going on, why he was so distant when we used to be so close. He didn't want to say anything, but I kept pushing. Eventually, my brother broke down and admitted he had an attraction to children, and he was being distant because he didn't want to get too close to my kids. He swears he's never acted on his attraction, and showed me his computer to prove it was clean. He told me he's been seeing a therapist for the last seven years in order to help keep his desires in check. He pleaded me repeatedly not to tell anyone, that he can't help his attraction but he's doing everything he can to not enact on it. It was so much information to process, and so I just got up and walked away.\n\nMy wife has asked me if I learned anything, but I lied and told her no. My feelings have been stewing for a week now, and I'm conflicted on what to do. On the one hand, I feel like I have a moral obligation to do whatever's necessary to keep my children and others safe. On the other hand, I know when my brother is lying, and I believe him when he says he's never acted on his desires, and I feel that exposing him will do nothing but make his life worse for no reason.\n\nAITA for keeping my brother's secret?

This is so beyond reddit.  Have you thought about talking to a therapist of your own about this?  Or even his?  Not to discuss your brother, because obviously, the therapist won't reveal anything, but just to talk to someone who obviously specializes in this.\n\nNAH and honestly, I applaud your brother for recognizing how wrong this is and staying away, seeing a therapist, etc.", "NAH very tough situation but sounds like he is being brutally honest. Of course, keep him in sight if your kids are around but if he is seeing a therapist then hopefully he would not cross that line. Keeping his secret will lead to regaining trust and you could get closer again, if you still want that", "NTA - for keeping the secret\n\nAlthough not ideal at least your brother is seeking help via a therapist. He has voluntarily kept his distance from your family and I would assume from others with children as well so as not act upon his impulses.\n\nRatting him out for a 'thought' that he has not acted upon would indeed be an AH move. Do you really want to ruin his life completely for a condition he has been actively seeking help for the last 7 years? If you expose his secret to anyone and it gets out then this may result in him acting on his impulses as he may feel he has nothing left to lose.\n\nHe is keeping his distance, so you and your family keep yours.", "NAH. There is no way anyone would take it well if they knew this about him. If he\u2019s making such a strong effort to avoid acting on it and he\u2019s trying to address the problem, it could well undermine his efforts to be judged as harshly as if he had actually done something wrong. Do keep him away from your kids, obviously. If you notice he\u2019s not staying away from kids anymore, then you have to say something. But for now, I feel like this is okay. It\u2019s a horrible secret to have to keep, I know, but there are good reasons to keep it right now.", "NAH\n\n\n\nDon't tell a single person!\n\n\n\nYour brother has done the right thing and needs to keep doing that, but he doesn't deserve to be treated badly by anyone because of it", "NTA - You know what you need to do to keep your kids safe.  He must trust you a lot to confide this to you.   \n\nIt sounds like your brother has a severe mental health issue that he's in treatment for.  Check in with him, but keep his secret.  It's clear that he's doing everything he possibly can to prevent harm from coming to the kids in his life.  \n\nThis news getting out could be devastating to him.  Literally devastating.  He could lose everything.  His family, his job, his reputation.  Maybe even his life.  \n\nThat being said, if your wife ever finds out that you kept this secret from her, your marriage is over.  It sucks that you were given this knowledge.  At this point, you're sort of TA either way.  There's not a good choice.", "NAH, unfortunately there\u2019s a lot of stigma around people who feel attracted towards minors (the ones who haven\u2019t acted on the desire). I\u2019ve interned at a mental health facility and it was actually pretty sad and admirable to see the steps some of them are taking to protect kids from themselves. They\u2019re seen as sick and gross and lose jobs, loved ones just because of what I believe to be a mental illness, even if they go to extremes to ensure they never, ever act on it. And some do get better and get over their attraction with help and support. He deserves sympathy, love and understanding which I\u2019m glad he found in you at least.", "NAH your brother recognizes he had issues he needs to work on and it taking steps to keep himself and others safe from his desires. There are a number of people out there who, like your brother, feel that way and do everything they can to get help but sadly there isn't much help put there for them. You should keep this secret for your brother and tell him you are proud of him for taking steps to keep away from children. You two can still have a relationship, especially now that you know his secret which he likely feels horrible shame about. Spend time with your brother and let him know he isn't a monster. Monsters don't care if they hurt people.", "NTA. You were trying to be a good brother and got handed WAY MORE than you bargained for. Tell your wife something like \"He's struggling with his mental health and won't be stable for a long time, so we're going to X, Y, Z\" to make sure you can keep your kids safe. If you have the bandwidth, check in with your brother once in a while and offer to speak with his care team if they think it'll be helpful. But if you can't do that, it's not a bad idea to talk to someone of your own about how to be a kind family member to someone that's struggling with that kind of heavy disorder. \n\nHis actual Dx is not your business to spread around, and not something to just blurt out to your wife without your brother knowing you're explaining it to her, but you have to make sure your brother doesn't victimize anyone. Talking to a professional about how to walk the line between the two is not a bad idea, just for your own health. (Aka: Oh holy hell this is beyond reddit's paygrade.)", "NTA. This is an incredibly tough situation, and it's natural to feel conflicted. Your top priority should be the safety of your children. It's essential to consult with a mental health professional to get guidance on how to proceed while also supporting your brother in seeking help. Take your time to make a thoughtful decision in this complex situation.", "NTA- He's sick, he can never see your kids, ever. And leave it at that. Therapy doesnt fix his issue, castration is the only course of action shown positive results and even that success rate is abysmally low.", "YTA. If I learned my husband kept a secret like this from me it would cause major trust issues between us. \n\nDon't you trust your wife? I would tell your brother that you don't keep secrets from your wife. You will be telling her, but you will swear her to secrecy as well. Then you and your wife can discuss the issue and decide how to proceed. And she will have all the information needed to ensure her children are safe at all times and she will trust you in future to come to her and that you handle major issues together as a partnership. You don't have the right to unilaterally decide that you know what's best for your family in this circumstance and to not tell her would be horribly selfish. Your brother should not have told you honestly it puts you in a very tough place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA", "Say nothing. There's a difference between attraction and sexual assaulting people. He is working with a therapist and not putting himself in any situation that would stir up a feeling. Leave him be. \n\nHe's still your brother. Support him in continuing the help he needs and don't tell anybody, that will put him in danger and stir up unnecessary hatred against him. If he was a bad person, he wouldn't be getting help and doing everything to ensure that he's never inappropriate. \n\nHis sexuality is tragic, he can't control that, he can only control his reaction to it, which he is doing.", "I don't think talking to *a* therapist is a possible solution. First of all, it's not his secret to share. Secondly, most therapists are mandated reporters and might feel they have to report this. Finally, if the secret spreads, it won't be a secret much longer and the fallout is major.\n\nTalking to brother's therapist, who already knows, may be the only therapeutic option.", "I think you should change your answer to NAH then instead of NTA", "It's an impossible decision.  Either choice would involve an unforgivable violation of trust.  \n\nHere's the problem,  everyone would react to this information differently.  There's no way to know what the wife will do.   We don't know her history or her personality.  She might call the police.  She might tell her husband's parents. She might tell acquaintances or other family members with kids.   If she has a sibling or close friend, she would probably confide this information to them.  She may tell her own parents.   It's the kind of secret that's really big and impactful.  \n\nAnd then who knows who those people will tell.  You can swear someone to secrecy, but that doesn't mean that they're actually going to keep this secret for the next 30+ years.  \n\nIf this secret gets out, it could easily lead to the brother committing suicide.  That's a real risk.   Even if not, he could have a criminal investigation brought against him.  He could lose all the connections he has in his life.  No one could recover from this.  \n\nI agree that the brother should have probably kept these details to himself to protect OP from the burden of such a heavy secret.", "Terrible advice. He shouldn't trust his wife with his brother's life. People who don't believe in secrets can never be trusted to keep them. \n\nThis doesn't affect her, the brother will never put himself in a situation where there's a possibility of stirring as much as a feeling and he's in therapy, there's no reason to share this.", "Oops u right"]}
