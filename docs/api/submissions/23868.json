The mechanism is thought to be a maternal immune response to male fetuses, whereby antibodies neutralize male Y-proteins thought to play a role in sexual differentiation during development. This would leave some regions of the brain associated with sexual orientation in the 'female typical' arrangement \u2013 or attracted to men. Biochemical evidence for this hypothesis was identified in 2017, finding mothers with a gay son, particularly those with older brothers, had heightened levels of antibodies to the NLGN4Y Y-protein than mothers with heterosexual sons.\"", "Not if it's a inbuilt natural mechanism for pop control.\nAnd btw oldest child, middle child type etc don't actually correlate to birth order, but.

You can have as many kids as possible while investing as few resources into them as possible and hope enough of them survive to make it worth it or you can have relatively fewer kids but invest a ton of resources into each one in the hopes that most or all of them make it to adulthood. This is on a species level, not an individual level. Amphibians that lay 100s of eggs are the \"quantity\" strategy. Humans are the \"quality\" strategy. \n\nSpecies that follow the quality strategy benefit from having other adults around with no children of their own to provide resources to the children. There's been research that shows having grandparents around is very helpful for ensuring your children make it to adulthood (in pre-modern times). This went against one popular theory (at the time) that in pre-modern societies, anyone who was past reproductive age would be a drain on the group's resources. I wouldn't be surprised if having a gay uncle is just as helpful to your children. They will help your children survive and out-compete other children because it's an extra adult providing for the children who isn't distracted by their own children.\n\nSo if you're a mother looking to maximize the success of your grandchildren and you already have several heterosexual sons that you can expect to have children, having a gay son that will support your other sons' children without having any of his own might be a better strategy than having another straight son. \n\nI say \"strategy\" but obviously no one is making this choice consciously; it's just that, for some reason, mothers who have a gay son after having several other sons are more likely to have had their genetics spread widely than others who didn't, so clearly there's some advantage. (Though it could be that the gene for \"make your 4th son gay\" is right next to the gene for \"slightly better grip strength\" and that's why it got propagated, not because it is actually useful on its own. Genetics is wild! And of course this is all an oversimplification, but I feel like that goes without saying.)", "Maybe we should start pushing this science. Men are most likely to cheat on their partner during pregnancy and right after. Pregnant folks are also most likely to be abused or die then.
