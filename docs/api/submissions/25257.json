When we first starting dating his sister(25F) and I got along great, but when I asked her to be a bridesmaid she turned me down, I assume because she would not be the center of attention. Everything spiraled from there and now we are pretty much NC with her. She is a brat truth be told and created a ton of unnecessary drama. Some highlights were showing up with no gift to our engagement party and not saying a word to us, she ran into my brother in public and was extremally rude to him, her and her boyfriend denied this happened and called my brother a liar. Now she is no longer invited to the wedding.\n\nThis summer we made an effort to see other members of his family so we have been spending our weekends meeting up for dinner with different members of his family. Naturally the issues with his sister come up. I chose not to hold back and told them exactly what she did. I thought they should know how toxic she is and decide for themselves if they want her in their lives. \n\nYesterday I saw on Instagram one of my fianc\u00e9's cousins posted a bunch of pictures from a girls wine day. All his females aunts and cousins were there and of course his sister was there. I was so hurt that they wouldn't even invite me. It felt like the pictures were posted specifically to make me feel bad and show that they took her side. I am supposed to be marrying into this family in a few months and they completely left me out.\n\nI reached out to one of his aunts I thought I was close to and asked if my fianc\u00e9's sister planned this, She said no it was another aunt. When I asked why I wasn't invited she said it was because of the drama between me and fianc\u00e9's sister, they didn't want the day to be uncomfortable so chose to keep it to just family which hurt to hear that they don't consider me family. I asked her if they meant they all took her side, she claimed no one was taking sides and if I chose to take it that way it was up to me. I ended the phone call very upset.\n\nMy bridal shower is in a few weeks and I don't want any of them there its for friends and family and obviously they don't consider me family so they don't need to be there. I want no drama at my shower and only people who are happy for me and love me there. I am debating if I want them at the wedding but I will deal with that later. I have a mass email written up ready to send disinviting them from my shower, my fianc\u00e9 is fine with it he can't stand his sister and is angry with his family. My MOH is trying to talk me out of sending it saying it will ruin my relationship with his family and my wedding and upset my MIL, but I think its already ruined.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1692715195, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y7ru0/wibta_for_uninviting_anyone_who_attended_a_winery/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You cannot, however, demand that everyone do the same.", "YTA.\n\nTBH, it sounds like you're the only person creating drama here...\n\nYou've been talking shit about their cousin/niece all summer. Did you really expect them to welcome you into their family with open arms ? You sound very immature.", "YTA. You claim to not want drama but it sounds like you're at the center of all of it. You \"assumed\" she turned you down when you asked her to be a bridesmaid because she won't be the \"center of attention\"? That's quite a judgment to make about someone you claimed to get along great with up to that point. You took your brother's word over hers about an encounter (with what proof?) You bad-mouthed her to her family. You assumed that pictures posted on social media were only there to make you feel bad (is everything about you?) And now you want to go nuclear and disinvite a bunch of your fiance's family members from your shower and possibly the wedding? There is one common denominator in all these issues and it's not the sister.", ">All his females aunts and cousins were there and of course his sister was there. I was so hurt that they wouldn't even invite me. It felt like the pictures were posted specifically to make me feel bad and show that they took her side. \n\n This is THEIR family, and unless other girlfriends/wives of the family men were there, then (a) this is their girl's day and (b) it has nothing to do with you.  \n\nOk, BUT re: the sister - So something is missing here. WHY doesn't your fiance's sister like you? No one acts like this for no reason.  Your fiance has to know, and maybe hasn't told you.  It's to the point where, ok, she's uninvited and NO ONE - not your fiance, not his parents - has fought you on that. ?!?!

I want no drama at my shower and only people who are happy for me and love me there. \n\nYou've put together two completely unrelated things in your head, and YWBTA and become the automatic out-law, if you start pulling stunts like this.  \"Not being invited\" to an event (especially one where you have open beef with one of the people in attendance, ahem the sister) is quite different than being \"uninvited.\"", "YTA.\n\n> She is a brat truth be told and created a ton of unnecessary drama. \n\nAnd yet you're the one who thinks 'uninviting people who hang out without me' is a perfectly fine and normal reaction.\n\nSounds to me like you're the drama-loving brat, and just projecting.\n\n> It felt like the pictures were posted specifically to make me feel bad and show that they took her side. \n\nNews flash: You are not, in fact, the center of the universe.", "YTA\n\nYou're trying to convince his family to exclude a family member for fairly petty reasons reasonable people wouldn't have gone scorched earth over.\n\nCalling someone toxic because she didn't want to be a bridesmaid (trust me, I don't want to be a bridesmaid for anyone ever again at this point), because of a disputed interaction with your brother, and because she didn't bring a gift to an engagement party (you're supposed to bring a gift to an engagement party? when did that become yet another gift grab?) is pretty over the top.\n\nAs for the winery weekend--well, you're not part of the family yet. You attempted to establish yourself \"in\" the family by declaring his sister toxic and uninviting her from your wedding over petty bullshit. Duh, nobody wants to hang out with you. His sister may or may not be toxic, but you've definitely proven that you are.\n\nIf your husband to be dislikes his sister, he should own that himself and take his consequences. Which will likely be losing his family.", "YTA. You really need to have a conversation with SIL to find out why she turned you down before you go scorched earth with your future husbands entire family. DO NOT send that email or it may end up being the end of your wedding.", "\u2026..you\u2019re not family? lol you haven\u2019t married into this family, but you expect them to cut out the sister (who they have known presumably her entire life from birth until now) in favour of someone they met in the last two years?\n\nYou have no idea why she turned down the bridesmaid offer. You just decided it because \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t be the centre of attention\u201d. Like, what - you\u2019re just adding assumptions and treating them as fact. \n\n\u201cI felt like the pictures were lost specifically to make me feel bad and show me they took her side\u201d. hahahaha this is such a crazy take. They posted them for themselves, not to make you feel anything. \n\nYou made a crazy play of it\u2019s me or her, and are upset that her family didn\u2019t reject their own in favour of you.  Such a narcissist. \n\nLol YTA. Get over yourself. \n\nYou can disinvite them if you choose, it\u2019s your wedding - but pretending you\u2019re the victim here isn\u2019t right.", "YTA, you haven't joined the family yet but keep stirring drama.

You may continue you vengeance by uninviting people, but that will not fixed your relationship with his family.", "[removed]", "YTA. People are allowed to have outings without you. You need to accept that because you and your SIL don\u2019t get along, there are going to be times that she\u2019s invited to someone you\u2019re not invited to and vice versa. You can\u2019t expect your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family to spend the rest of their lives navigating your drama. You\u2019ve only been part of the family for a short period of time, while your SIL has been part of the family for her entire life. If they ever have to choose between the two of you, your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family will most likely choose her. That\u2019s just the way it is. Based on your post, I have a feeling that you hold at least half, if not the majority of the blame for this feud.", "I feel like its YTA.\n\nAlthough it would be upsetting to anyone who gets purposefully left out of a get together like the brunch you mentioned, I feel like you need to take some responsibility over bad mouthing her to her whole family. The aunts and the sister are totally entitled to organise their own day outs - you are of course not family **yet**, perhaps they just wanted a drama less day. No one is out to get you - they had a good time, so they posted about it.\n\nListen to your MOH, I think it's a bit childish to uninvite most of your future family over a brunch, and uninviting your future SIL because she didn't get you a gift and was rude to your brother..\n\nThere must be more to your relationship with you and your future SIL, how did it go from asking her to be your bridesmaid to this?", "YTA. You can\u2019t expect your fianc\u00e9es ENTIRE family to cut off his sister just because you felt like she\u2019s been rude to you a few times. That\u2019s extremely petty and honestly, imo, pretty toxic behavior on your part. From what you said about that gathering it sounds like it was all of your fianc\u00e9es female family members that are related by blood which yes would include is sister and I think it makes sense to exclude you from that gathering for two reasons 1) you\u2019re not related to them yet 2) given how you bad mouthed the sister over the summer that\u2019s a recipe for drama if your both there. My guess is there\u2019s more to the story from the sisters perspective that you\u2019re not giving us because you\u2019re clearly biased and trying to sway the judgment in your favor.", "YTA. So one of the highlights of her behavior was no engagement gift? You expected her family to side with you, which is so entitled, it beggars belief.", "YTA - this reads like you are the source of all this drama. How many presents do you expect? And then you bad mouth and gossip about this girl to her own family and somehow expect them to take YOUR side? Some rando they just met. Why on earth would you ever expect them to take your side over hers? You were the one trying to force people to take sides and you lost. This is just the expected consequences of your own behaviour.", "YTA.\n\nYou are the center of the drama in your life, and I don't think you are a very reliable narrator.", "YTA. I do believe she is a stirrer too. But, from the way you disinvited a substantial number of your fianc\u00e9's relatives for daring to stay in touch with someone you wanted to exclude, it is pretty clear you are the more unreasonable and dramatic one.", "\"Everything spiraled from there...\"  I feel there is an *awful* lot of detail being glossed over in this line.", "YTA \n\nWow this sounds like it was written by a 14 year old but you\u2019re 30?! \n\nYou hate drama and yet you\u2019re stirring drama. Grow up!", "YTA I\u2019m not sure I believe your telling about the SIL because of the way you talk about her. So I\u2019d love to hear the other side of the story. You suggested that family (that isn\u2019t your family) consider cutting their own family member out because of some petty drama??\n \nYou sound insufferable and I feel for that family for having to deal with you.", "YTA. So\u2026FSIL declined to be a bridesmaid and didn\u2019t give you a party gift and you made all this drama that could easily derail your fianc\u00e9 still wanting to marry you at all.", "YTA. \n\n\"I chose not to hold back and told them exactly what she did. I thought they should know how toxic she is and decide for themselves if they want her in their lives.\" \n\nSo you trash-talked your future sister-in-law to *her* family, and are now whining that they chose her over you? You're *not* family yet, and  your behavior is extremely narcissistic. Your MOH is absolutely right, you're ruining your relationship with your fianc\u00e9's family and you're going to upset a lot of people because you have a bad case of main character syndrome.", "YTA\n\nYou are escalating the drama rather than focusing on mending the rift. Everything from assuming she declined your wedding party due to being self centered, to calling her a brat, and trying to mobilize your husband's family to \"your side.\" If you want to be an actual part of the family, you don't try to mobilize troops to your side. You find a way to tolerate the family member you don't care for. You may be welcomed as a new family member by marriage, but they aren't going to join you in a campaign to ostracize their blood without compelling reasons. What you described are personality conflicts, not issues to go to war over.\n\nMy SIL is a self-centered brat. I've dealt carefully and graciously with her for 13 years. She gets along fine with me, and maturity has improved her. I'm the bigger person when I have to be, and I respect the love her family holds for her by keeping those feelings to myself. The situation has remained drama free and only improved as a result of my choices.", "Yta\n\nStory read like you think the world revolves around you. \n\n\"She didn't give a present\"\n\n\"They planned the wine party and took pictures *just* to upset *me*\"\n\n\"We're not married yet, but how dare they see actual *family* that they've known their whole lives as family and not see this person that they've known less than 2 years as family\"", "Basically, every decision you have made in this has been a cry for drama and attention. \n\nSo what she didn't want to be a bridesmaid get over it. \n\nWhile it's common courtesy to get a gift for certain occasions it's not a bottom-of-the-line deal. \n\nShe was rude to your brother at a grocery store and what proof is there besides he said she said. \n\nOfc his family is going to choose Sil over you after you bad-mouthed her to her family with the guise of \"they can see how toxic she is\"\n\nThis just screams attention seeking and that \"I can be the only young female in the family\"", "YTA. Why on earth would her own family who love her and have known her her whole life care if you think she\u2019s toxic? How could you seriously think they would take your side or even be impartial? She\u2019s their family and you have been on the scene two years.", "YTA\n\nI had to scroll up to check ages because this is some late teens' early 20's nonsense. \n\n>Naturally the issues with his sister come up. I chose not to hold back and told them exactly what she did. I thought they should know how toxic she is and decide for themselves if they want her in their lives.\n\nYou showed exactly how toxic YOU are, and they have apparently decided for themselves if they want YOU in their lives. \n\nI can't figure out why you're being so inflammatory and immature, but it's about to be a no contact situation, and you will not be the one making that decision. I wouldn't want to go on a fun winery outing with you either.", "YTA\n\nYou obviously have beef with the sister, so inviting both would lead to an evening of arguing. And from your text I neither understand your beef, nor why she is a brat? What is the issue with not bringing gifts to your engagement party? Cause that is something I only know from entitled people.\n\nSomething about why the falling out happened is omitted here.", "YTA\n\nFirst you are not family YET \n\nSecond, people can have events in different permutations. I would start inviting these ladies in different combinations to form a relationship with them.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou sound quite entitled and toxic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My MOH is trying to talk me out of sending it saying it will ruin my relationship with his family and my wedding and upset my MIL, but I think its already ruined.\" .. Why do you think they would care to come to your wedding if you uninvited them from the shower? Why would they waste their time on you AH?  You sound like a toxic and petty AH, incapable of meaningful and positive relationships. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't let your jealousy and pettyness ruin any more of your relationships.", "YTA \n\nJust because you don\u2019t like your SIL, doesn\u2019t mean the entire family is obligated to ostracize/disown  her to make you comfortable or to make you feel included. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want her at the wedding or the shower, fine- don\u2019t invite her. Not only does it seem like NO ONE has a problem with her not being there, but it also seems they\u2019re going out of their respecting your decision to not be around her. That doesn\u2019t mean his family isn\u2019t happy for you or doesn\u2019t support you. If you don\u2019t invite **anyone** from his family, just because of this- then them not involving you in anything else afterwards **will be entirely your fault** \n\nThey\u2019re allowed to still spend time with their cousin/niece/daughter/ whatever WITHOUT inviting you or letting you know. \n\n**You are not the matriarch of the family. You don\u2019t dictate who they can or cannot associate with within the family**", "YTA, you sound so tiring. I'm not invited to everything involving my husband's family, and I could honestly care less. It is very childish what you are thinking about doing. Do you want to make your fiance's family hate you?", "YTA. And exhausting, self centered and I don't think you would make a day out a pleasant and relaxing experience. The fallout afterwards from your visiting tour to family members to debrief with your litany of complaints would put anyone off in itself.", "YTA. The only person causing drama in this whole situation is you. The only thing his sister did was show up without a gift and barely said a word? His aunts, sister, and mom went to a winery day without you? Oh woe is me!!! You're not entitled to be invited to anything and uninviting them from your wedding because they went out without you is extremely immature. You need to grow up. Just because you're getting married doesn't mean the world revolves around you.", "Just think about it this way. If you uninvite these people to your shower that means no gifts. YTA.", "YTA. Yikes, what a way to start with his family. You should not even be asking about 'taking sides' - I'm shocked to see that you're 30 and not...IDK 14? You've put his family in a very difficult position, forced to exclude one or the other of you, and sorry honey but you're not going to win out here. The best thing you can do is try to smooth things over with his sister. Do you really expect her to be outcasted by HER whole family becuase you two can't get along? \n\nBEYOND THAT, your reasons for considering her 'toxic' seem extremely flimsy. HOW DARE SHE attend an event without a gift in tow. You've really escalated what seems to be small slights and this is becoming a 'fuck around and find out' situation for you. \n\nI hope for the peace in the family and your long-term happiness with your groom that you can fix this.", "Sending that mass e-mail would be a really bad idea.\n\nI doubt they were trying to make you feel bad because of that trip, instead it sounds like the aunt's response was pretty honest -- it's clear you and future SIL have drama and they wanted to steer clear of it. I don't think it necessarily means they're taking her side, it's probably just that she's a blood relative and you're not.\n\nThe best thing to do is honestly to let things die down. I know it's tempting to want to do something about the situation, but it's probably going to make things worse. If you can rise above the situation and trying to keep being nice to everyone, it will probably blow over. The more you try to attack her and them, the more you're going to come out looking unreasonable and like you're the one causing drama.", "YTA - Keep burning those bridges, you'll have *NO* family left.", "YTA - you are not family, you only dated this guy for 2 years!! How can you expect them to see you as family. Marry this guy, then get to know them as family. Why do you think his sister would ask a girl, her brother us dating less than 2 years, to be one of the bridal party?", "You *are* the drama, also YTA", "Aha.\n\n>my MIL would be devastated and **might not pay for some wedding things**\n\nReally, OP?", "From reading this\u2026.chances are you seem to be the one stirring up the drama. \n\nYou will absolutely be TA if you uninvited anyone from your bridal shower AND wedding because they hung out without you! Very very petty if you do", "YTA I know shock horror but people don't live their life to serve you, you love drama stop pretending you don't", "YTA.\n\nIt is hard to tell whether your SIL is creating drama or not. The only witness we have here isn't exactly reliable. \n\nWhat is certain is that you sure as hell love drama.", "YTA \n\nYou made the mistake to \u201cnot hold back and tell them exactly what she did\u201d why did you do that?! You\u2019re supposed to be concentrating on your wedding planning, yet you thought they needed to know how toxic she is(according to you) in what way was she rude to your brother? And why was she uninvited from the wedding? \nAnother mistake was calling to see who planned the wine trip, and ask why you weren\u2019t invited! She is their niece, cousin! You haven\u2019t even married into the family and you are already trying to divide them. \nI think you need to step away from all this, and not create more drama.

I\u2019m guessing her reasons for not being a bridesmaid are very different from what you assume they are.", "YTA\n\nSo only you are in the position to determine how his family will interact with a person (family member) they have known for 25 years.  The aunt told you they didn't want drama and that was why you were not invited.  \n\nYour description of why the sister was not invited was flimsy as well.  She did not give an engagement gift (social faux pas yes, but...) and she was rude to her brother (which she denies which likely is a family dynamics thing).  You then took it upon yourself to tell everyone that she didn't give you a gift and was rude BECAUSE your don't hold back.\n\nEveryone is giving you a chance to be part of the family but you want everyone to bow and acknowledge you.  The family says you're taking this the wrong way.  Seems you have many expectations and interpretations that are not in line with reality or are self perceived slights.  \n\nTake a chill pill and see this as a chance to be part of something (the family) as opposed to cutting yourself and your fianc\u00e9 off from it (which will likely lead to future resentment btw)", "YTA. Maybe the SIL sucks too, this post is pretty vague about the drama that started between you two. But with the way this post reads, I\u2019m not convinced you\u2019re a victim of it all. \n\nClearly you\u2019re continuing the drama. Clearly you aren\u2019t making a true effort to make amends with your future SIL. And clearly the family you are marrying into has picked up on all the drama you are causing/taking part in and they\u2019re doing their best to stay out of it. \n\nTake some responsibility for your part in all of this drama. What an awful way to start a marriage. Sending that mass email will only (continue to) make things worse.", "You're the one creating all the drama, it comes right through your narrative.

I can\u2019t believe you thought you could get her thrown out of her own family. That was clearly your intention since you stated \u201cI thought they should know how toxic she is and decide for themselves if they want her in their lives\u201d. None of the things you described even cast her in a bad light.  A lot of people don\u2019t want to be bridesmaids anymore, because of all the Bridezillas who seem to think their bridesmaids are just unpaid labor. You didn\u2019t say what she actually did to your brother that was so rude. But I\u2019m inclined to think that he\u2019s lying, or at best, exaggerating just because of the things you\u2019ve said about her so far. The final nail in your coffin is that you honestly thought you could turn her own family against her. You seem to have a very high opinion of yourself. YTA", "YTA. Your campaign to get your fianc\u00e9s sister alienated from her own family failed. \nFYI, someone turning down a bridesmaid position could be for numerous reasons. \nUnfortunately you are so self centred that has probably never occurred to you. \nYou sound exhausting, to think someone posting pictures of a day out was to insult you is beyond \u201cI\u2019m the main character\u201d attitude. \nGet over yourself", "YTA\n\n Don't worry, your fiancee would divorce your entitled and annoying ass anyway, so who cares??", "YTA. You sound exhausting. It sound like most of the \"drama\" has been started by you over you not getting your own way. Did you ever stop to consider that she may not have wanted to be your bridesmaid because she couldn't afford it, didn't feel able to hold up whatever responsibilities you wanted her to take on in that role, or just didn't want to concede to whatever demands you felt entitled to impose on her person as the bride? Or maybe she just didn't like the dress.  A whole LOT of things that have nothing what-so-ever to do with not being the centre of attention.\n\nIf you want to make people uncomfortable enough to make them want to keep you away from in integral part of their blood family, you have to understand that there will be some activities that you are simply not going to be invited to because that other person will be there. Of the two of you, the aunt that did the organizing prefers her niece. No drama from you was warranted. The fact that you went around to other relatives demanding an explanation for your exclustion rather than simply accepting that you weren't invited to this ONE THING,  says loads about you. None of it good.", "YTA if you disinvite people. You'll be burning bridges, and although your fiance might be fine with it now, they are still family and he may want them in his life.", "Take the opportunity to be the bigger person.   You've let everyone know about the drama, and now you're shocked that family is excluding you to cut down on the drama.   Don't escalate this and you may be able to salvage the relationship.\n\nYes, your WBTA.", ".... you do know that you are the problem here, right? Maybe if you want family invites you should try not running your mouth at every family dinner. YTA", "YTA", "Sounds like you are creating more drama. Of course, they are going to invite her over you.

When we first starting dating his sister(25F) and I got along great, but when I asked her to be a bridesmaid she turned me down, I assume because she would not be the center of attention. Everything spiraled from there and now we are pretty much NC with her. She is a brat truth be told and created a ton of unnecessary drama. Some highlights were showing up with no gift to our engagement party and not saying a word to us, she ran into my brother in public and was extremally rude to him, her and her boyfriend denied this happened and called my brother a liar. Now she is no longer invited to the wedding.\n\nThis summer we made an effort to see other members of his family so we have been spending our weekends meeting up for dinner with different members of his family. Naturally the issues with his sister come up. I chose not to hold back and told them exactly what she did. I thought they should know how toxic she is and decide for themselves if they want her in their lives. \n\nYesterday I saw on Instagram one of my fianc\u00e9's cousins posted a bunch of pictures from a girls wine day. All his females aunts and cousins were there and of course his sister was there. I was so hurt that they wouldn't even invite me. It felt like the pictures were posted specifically to make me feel bad and show that they took her side. I am supposed to be marrying into this family in a few months and they completely left me out.\n\nI reached out to one of his aunts I thought I was close to and asked if my fianc\u00e9's sister planned this, She said no it was another aunt. When I asked why I wasn't invited she said it was because of the drama between me and fianc\u00e9's sister, they didn't want the day to be uncomfortable so chose to keep it to just family which hurt to hear that they don't consider me family. I asked her if they meant they all took her side, she claimed no one was taking sides and if I chose to take it that way it was up to me. I ended the phone call very upset.\n\nMy bridal shower is in a few weeks and I don't want any of them there its for friends and family and obviously they don't consider me family so they don't need to be there. I want no drama at my shower and only people who are happy for me and love me there. I am debating if I want them at the wedding but I will deal with that later. I have a mass email written up ready to send disinviting them from my shower, my fianc\u00e9 is fine with it he can't stand his sister and is angry with his family. My MOH is trying to talk me out of sending it saying it will ruin my relationship with his family and my wedding and upset my MIL, but I think its already ruined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I ended up say no as I wasn't comfortable being in front of that many people doing something so foreign to me (he was the first of us to get married) and didn't want to mess up his and his wife's day. \n\nInstead of trying to destroy relationships because I didn't do exactly what he wanted, he thanked me for my honesty and offered me a role as a groomsman which I was much more comfortable with, like a reasonable adult.\n\nEdit to add: And who brings gifts to an engagement party. You're already having a shower and a reception, those are when gifts are given", "YTA: although I understand your feelings.
