It left all of us devastating and in shock. We were together for 20 years. Married for 17. He was the love of my life. My best friend. Ngl, I still have a hard time accepting his passing.\n\n\nI have a great relationship with my husband's family. They've always offered their support with anything I ever needed and me the same with them.\n\n\nInfo important here: My husband's family all live in a multigenerational home. MIL, two BILs, 1 SIL, 2 nephews, and their girlfriends. 8 persons in the same home. I live in a tiny apartment (my husband and I's place) \nEvery family dinner has always been held at the multigenerational home because it's bigger, spacious, and they have large dining table while my husband and I only had a tiny table with two chairs.\n\n\nFor the one year anniversary of my husband's death, I suggested having dinner at their place. I mentioned not having a lot of money for it but enough for pizza and dessert. I wanted something to my husband's image and I mentioned it. Everyone agreed. My way of thanking them for being there for me. At first MIL suggested going to a restaurant instead but I mentioned having a small budget (I work part time) and put my foot down for a smaller get together. \n\n\nDinner was tonight. Earlier today MIL called and mentioned the warm weather and suggested going to an Asian restaurant instead. She told me everyone would be paying for their own dinner since it'll be more expensive but I replied that I'd prefer something to my husband's image. He didn't like Asian food and I wanted something more low key. Where we could talk. She agreed.\n\n\nI had bought an expensive exquisite chocolate cake for dessert from a bakery my husband loved. Paid around 40$ for 8 persons. With about enough money left for the pizza, fries, poutines, and sodas for everyone. I had about 90$ left. Which was plenty for many pizzas and everything needed for a good meal for 9 persons. \nI arrived with the cake. We sat down and I asked people what kind of pizza they wanted.\n\nWell my nephew's girlfriend had a migraine and she's a picky eater. People discussed ordering somewhere else instead. They picked the same Asian restaurant my MIL suggested earlier to please my nephew's girlfriend. People started naming their order. Asian fusion, noodles, full meals. MIL assured me it wouldn't be expensive as everyone ordered items like chicken and rice. \n\nThe order was placed. It arrived. Total: 180$. I was shocked. My husband's family all knows I work part time and I'm struggling financially. \nPeople thanked me for the meal. Some of us played card for a while and I left.\n\n\nOnce I arrived home, I wrote in the family group chat my dissatisfaction. I explained how I had a budget for the month and their decision to order from the Asian restaurant really messed with my financed.

I'm sorry for your loss OP and I hope you have more of a support system than Judy the in-laws.", "NTA, but you should have clearly stated that you could pick up the tab for pizza but not for the other meal option. I'm shocked it was so cheap, to be honest, so they probably tried to keep it reasonable but it was still 2x your budget which is unacceptable.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry.", "NTA, if they want to eat there so badly, they can pay for it themselves and your meal.

I'm broke soo yall havr to pay sorry", "NTA\n\nBut why were you expected to pay for everyone in the first place?  Your MIL said everyone would pay for themselves if they did the asian food option.  You should have just paid the $90 and asked them to get their wallets out. \n\nI'm so sorry your husband has left you in a difficult financial position and that his family is so unsupportive.

Many people love to be frivolous with other people\u2019s money. Clearly all your family cared about was getting a free meal. You\u2019re NTA for telling the how you felt but you shouldn\u2019t have let them put you in this position in the first place.
