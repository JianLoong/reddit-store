NTA lmao. Cats don\u2019t typically participate in their own abuse they whack the shit out of people. Also lint rollers aren\u2019t like duct tape or something they\u2019re typically more gentle because they need to easily roll.", "NTA\n\nYour cat likes it, and it's mainly pulling out already-loose fur, so it's not \"ripping off\" the fur.\n\nI vacuum my dog sometimes because she sheds constantly year-round. She's not even the biggest fan of it, but she sighs and lets me do it (I use the corner thingie).", "NTA. If you do it gently, all you're doing is getting all the loose fur. If your cat is letting you do it and is purring while you're doing so, I'm pretty sure it's safe to continue to do. You are in no way an animal abuser for lint rolling your cat.", "NTA. The only thing rolling a lint roller over your cat does is take off the fur that's already about to fall off anyways. This is a really weird thing for your friends to get upset about.", "NTA that is so dumb. Lint rollers are literally meant to collect loose hair. They do not have the stickiness for anything else. \n\nYou are fine OP.", "If you are lint rolling your cat i suggest getting a reusable one so you dont have to waste money on the disposable ones. Alot of cats actually like being lint rolled your friend was being ridiculous", "We do the same thing with our cat. She loves it and even goes to the drawer and indicates that it\u2019s time for us to get to it. Really cuts down on the furballs.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say NTA", "NTA u can get cat lint rollers at a pet store!! they\u2019re reusable", "Just throwing it out here that you should invest in a FURminator. It helps to remove the undercoat without cutting it, and it\u2019ll probably help to the point that you won\u2019t need to lint roll your cat itself.", "NTA. It's a cat. If you're doing something to it that it doesn't like, you'll know for certain. If your hand isn't bleeding and the lint roller hasn't been shredded, then you're fine.", "OH MY GOD That is an amazing hack!  NTA obviously for any of that nonsense but are the glue chemicals cat safe?  I want to look into this now because sheddy cats/dogs/humans are w00f.  Cats love rubbing their face into concrete floors that are prickly.  As long as everyone is safe NTA.  FYI my friends used this bristly thing to de-fur their cats.  It works a-ok.", "NTA, your friend is imagining that it's a lot worse than it is, and seemingly not willing to put any further thought into it.", "NTA, but you could also try a brush/furminator as those work well also.", "INFO Are they maybe thinking about a different kind of lint roller than you are using? I've seen a few that are pretty much fly tape on a roll that I would consider abusive to a furry animal considering my younger brother managed to pull out a chunk of his own hair with it as a kid, and others that are much less sticky, or even just like soft velcro.", "Hahaha what? NTA", "OMG you are so NTA. The cat would definitely let you know if she didn't like you doing that. You'd have scratches, bite marks, and she'd run away from you every single time you brought out the lint roller. The other person needs to calm down.", "Some pet hair removers actually look like glue based lint rollers. So, I figure you're fine if your cat isn't feeling like they just got shaved? I always used a combination rake and razor pet hair remover with my dog. You're just not supposed to apply a lot of pressure when you use it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I recommend getting some cleaning wipes for afterward to be sure that the residue from the roller is off of their fur. Otherwise, the rolling is no different than a grooming brush as far as what hair is coming off of your feline.", "NTA but if it is the sticky/tape rollers I assume that can get pricey added up. Have you looked into de-shedder tools?", "NTA.  My old cat used to kick his arthritic ass into high gear when he heard the lint roller. It was impossible to actually clean anything because he wanted to be rolled (and to lick it, for some reason). He hated being brushed. The only other way he would tolerate being groomed was to gently scrape him with a butter knife. \n\nA furminator is actually something you DO have to be careful with--it's easy to over-groom them and some cats find it uncomfortable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She loves it.\nIf a cat does not like what you are doing, they will most certainly make you aware of that.", "Lol - NTA AT ALL! Have they ever *met* a cat?! If it hurt them in any way you would t be getting a lint roller near it. Also, what so they think brushing the fur is doing?! You\u2019re not *waxing* your cat, it\u2019s removing the fur they are shedding", "I used one on my cats too and my daughter uses one on the dog. NTA", "NTA. hello, fellow cat lint rollers!!

I used to use it on a huge horse for shedding out a winter coat.", "Absolutely NTA. Whenever I lint roll my clothes my cat follows me around yelling until I lint roll her too. She loves it. I\u2019m sure your cat does too if she\u2019s purring. Your friend doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.", "NTA but brushing will remove more.  Better food also may help reduce shedding", "Don\u2019t lint roll. It\u2019s a sticky tape thing on a roller, right? You know it is leaving a small amount of sticky residue on your cat. So dust and cobwebs and dirt are more likely to stick to the fur. Ew.\n\nThe sticky residue is *probably* non toxic to the cat. But still. \n\nUse a brush. Or a \u201cFURminator\u201d tool. Google it. Some people even use a dust buster/vacuum cleaner, (The noise would scare my fur ball,  but some  cats don\u2019t mind). \n\nI know you are trying.

When your done take lint roll sheet and stick it to the cats head its fuckin hilarious", "NTA\n\nIf you do it gently it just grabs the loose fur. I mean don't be shoving it against your cat and ripping up hair, but then I doubt your cat would just sit still during all that", "NTA. If it was pulling your cat's hair out, your cat would have put a stop to said kint rolling immediately.\n\nA natural bristle (human) hair brush also works quite well. (Just don't get it mixed up with your own brush).", "nta but this is the best thing i have hear all day. lint roll your cat to your (and your cat\u2019s) hearts content", "Lol NTA at all. I do this with my cat and my dog. I brush them and then lint roll them to get the extra hair off. They both love it.", "LOL.   NTA", "I do this too and my cats rub into, my partners cat has a brush he rubs against too. If they didn't like it they would not be leaning in to it.", "NTA. I lint roll my dogs from time to time.

If a gentle lint roller is abuse then I\u2019m committing war crimes.", "If you were abusing or hurting your cat, you would know. They are extremely vocal about it. Anyone with a cat know that.

There are some really, really sticky ones, and then there are some that are less I sticky, which I assume would be perfectly fine.
