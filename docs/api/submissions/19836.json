They can be absolutely debilitating and yesterday, when I went to the hospital was one of those days.\n\nI was practically unable to walk.  My roommate had to get a wheelchair for me to wheel me through the parking lot because any position besides sitting curled up in some way was excruciatingly painful and I would end up vomiting.  \n\nSo we wait a bit for triage and when we get in this triage woman already seems incredibly snarky.  She made a face when I was wheeled in as if she thought I was faking.  My suspicions were confirmed when I was hunched over silently crying while trying to answer questions and instead of just politely asking me to sit up (or asking me if that was even a good option for me at that time), she KICKED my chair and said \u201csit up, you\u2019re not geriatric you\u2019re dramatic.\u201d Sure enough as soon as I sat up I needed to vomit, so I grabbed the nearest waste basket and did so.  She had this disgusted, still judgmental look on her face and said \u201cgreat, now I have to clean that out on top of everything else I have to do.\u201d\n\nDone with her bullshit, I said \u201cYeah I gathered that you don\u2019t like doing your job from the moment you opened your mouth.  Least you know I\u2019m not faking now though.\u201d  She then rushed through the process of registering me and sent me out without a word.  \n\nWhen we left the hospital my roommate told me I had acted like a \u201cKaren\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t have spoken to her that way because I \u201chave no idea how hard her job is.\u201d  I responded \u201cWell I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s my problem.  She chose that field for herself, she doesn\u2019t get to take her anger and dissatisfaction with her own career out on distressed patients and expect them to be fine with it.\u201d\n\nShe just responded \u201cWow, you\u2019re seriously entitled and I don\u2019t even know how to move forward with this conversation.  Hopefully you gain some perspective.\u201d\n\nLike what?? What exactly am I missing here.  I was in intense levels of pain and on top of that being mistreated and harshly judged by someone who was supposed to help.

You were in an extreme level of pain and the nurse's behavior was unprofessional and lacking empathy. Her job is indeed hard, but that doesn't give her the right to mistreat you. It seems like you snapped in response to her actions, not because you were feeling \"entitled\". However, always remember, it's more productive to report such behaviors to the management rather than getting into verbal altercations.", "NTA- some places seem to automatically assume anybody who is claiming abdominal pain is a drug-seeker. And I swear even with electronic records, NOBODY actually looks at previous history.\n\nI was treated like that when I had weird abdominal pains and didn\u2019t know why. They finally went away after being ignored in the waiting room for several hours, and the various doctors and nurses dismissal of it made me not take it seriously. When it came back the second time several months later I went to a different hospital that did take it seriously, and it turned out it was only gas- that was building up in my intestine because I has an ovarian cyst the size of a grapefruit causing blockages.", "NTA that woman was absolutely unprofessional and should be reported. I have stomach issues myself and am in and out of the hospital, and I have never been treated like that by a medical professional. \n\nIt\u2019s not okay, and I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.", "NTA. Are you sure she was an actual RN and not a CNA? I ask because my husband is an actual RN and there are codes of conduct he abides by that include things like \"believing the patient\", \"assessing the discomfort/pain level of the patient\", \"treating the patient with respect\"...etc.\n\nI've met some seriously nasty CNAs though. I'm sorry you were subjected to that kind of treatment and hope you're doing alright now.\n\nBTW, your friend is a total, judgmental AH and likely isn't a true friend.", "NTA. I\u2019m from a family of nurses and was a CNA for many years. No one has the right to treat you like that especially when they know full well that they are supporting some people that can be having the worse moments of their life. Fuck her.", "NTA \n\nIm pretty sure you can report the nurse as well. if she is is constantly doing this she doesn't need to be in the field she is in", "NTA - You are not entitled but you are entitled to receive quality care. I hope your are feeling better.\n\nThe nurse's presentation and comments were unprofessional and not necessary. Everyone can have a bad day but complaining about vomit and stating you are dramatic is awful and demeaning.  \n\nEvery hospital has an official list of 'Patient's Right'. Example: \"A patient is treated with dignity, respect, and consideration;\" -  Type in, \"How do I file a complaint as a patient in the ER at 'X' hospital\".  Summarize this post to facts. Your efforts could lead to this person receiving more training and it could prevent other people from experiencing what you endured. Best to you!", "NTA some medically staff are jerks. I once had to go to the ER and my friend went with me and was shocked at how I was treated. You are right to be upset at how you were treated and should report the nurse.", "NTA. you only gave back what she was giving you", "NTA. I also have stomach ulcers and they can be horrific. Your roommate isn't wrong that nurses have seriously difficult jobs but that's no excuse for how she treated you.", "NTA. Your roommate needs to STFU. This triage nurse sounds like she is in a wrong job and shouldn't be interfacing with sick people who need care and empathy. I know young people get horrified when someone says or does something that \"could cost that person their job!!!\" -- but if that person is bad to the point of dangerous in their job, their behavior needs to be brought to the attention of the hospital management. Imagine if she gets mad and vindictive with someone she decides she doesn't like, but they may be in very bad shape, and she'd maliciously downplay their condition -- she has that power in triage. That person might die for her attitude. Maybe she could be transferred somewhere behind the scenes doing the paperwork, filing insurance claims, that sort of thing.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA\n\nYou were in a lot of pain and she was incredibly rude, would it have been better to keep your mouth shut, probably but you didn\u2019t deserve how you were being treated and it can be hard to think clearly when you\u2019re in pain and she was still rude after you vomited and were clearly unwell.", "\n\nNo, you are not the AITA. It's completely understandable that you would be angry about being treated in this way while in a great deal of pain. While you could have possibly handled the situation better, it is not your responsibility to ensure her job is enjoyable for her - especially when she is treating you poorly. The fact that she kicked your chair, was judgemental, and then lashed out at you when called out is completely inappropriate behavior.", "NTA - being in pain like that doesn't give you a lot of mental space left over to be polite to people who think you are \"faking it\". Your roommate doesn't understand because they have never had to experience it. I have been crying in pain and dismissed as drug seeking instead of being given help; it is terrible and can really mess with your ability to seek help during other serious emergencies.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I might have vomited on the nurse instead just to be petty. I hope you are doing at least a little better now.", "NTA. You won\u2019t become the asshole you would have to assault her while she is helpless and vulnerable until she pukes her bleeding guts out. Ask a lawyer how to get payback without resorting to violence.", "I\u2019m a nurse & I\u2019ve been an ED nurse as well, and you absolutely did not deserve to be treated that was. NOT THE ASSHOLE. \n\nAt no point should a staff member kick your chair or call you dramatic. She was being abusive. \n\nPLEASE CALL AND LODGE A COMPLAINT. Who knows how many people she\u2019s treated poorly who possibly can\u2019t identify the mistreatment or don\u2019t know they have the right to be treated with dignity & respect.", "NTA\n\nI refuse to go to the hospital for anything other than stitches or a cast because I've had *far* too many medical professionals be shitty to me for reasons that had nothing to do with me.\n\nMedical professionals don't get a pass to be shitty because they had a hard day. Plain and simple.", "NTA: Ive been treated the same way from so called medical professionals myself. \nHad blind spots in my eye and high blood pressure when pregnant, the young doctor pretty much made it clear she thought there was nothing wrong with me.\n\n2days later i went to triage at midnight with weird contraction like pains all around my back and abdomen. The triage nurse couldnt be bothered with me and kept telling me it was a UTI. Another pregnant woman there looked very worried at me. I told the nurse it couldnt be a UTI as i had just been tested for it, it was also my second pregnancy and i knew something was wrong.\nI was writhing about in pain and when she checked the babies heart beat, she almost tripped up running around the bed to call theatre.\nThey rushed me down and i was surrounded by doctors. The doctor trying to put a needle in the back of my hand for the anesthetic, was the same doctor who checked my eyes and treated me like i was lying.\nShe knew her mistake and she could not get the needle in for panicking.\nEventually i shouted at her, while writhing about in agony \"what the f are you doing?\" She rushed away out the room and i then said \"im not making it up now am i?\" \n\nI dont feel bad about it, i tried to tell them something was wrong and they treated me like an attention seeking idiot, i was 27 at the time. \nTurned out i had a placental abruption and two days before was when my placenta had started to peel away from my womb. They had to do an emergency c-section. Both myself and my daughter had 2minutes to live, had they not got her out when they did, she wouldve suffocated and i would've bled to death. My daughter who is nearly 16, was born 6weeks early and spent the first two weeks of her life inthe neonatal ICU\n\nSo you're NTA, the nurse is and so is your friend.\nMedical professionals dont get a free pass to treat people like crap because their having a tough time, their not the only people with problems", "I get the feeling there is some Information left out here and some projecting\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
