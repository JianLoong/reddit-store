They can be absolutely debilitating and yesterday, when I went to the hospital was one of those days.\n\nI was practically unable to walk.  My roommate had to get a wheelchair for me to wheel me through the parking lot because any position besides sitting curled up in some way was excruciatingly painful and I would end up vomiting.  \n\nSo we wait a bit for triage and when we get in this triage woman already seems incredibly snarky.  She made a face when I was wheeled in as if she thought I was faking.  My suspicions were confirmed when I was hunched over silently crying while trying to answer questions and instead of just politely asking me to sit up (or asking me if that was even a good option for me at that time), she KICKED my chair and said \u201csit up, you\u2019re not geriatric you\u2019re dramatic.\u201d Sure enough as soon as I sat up I needed to vomit, so I grabbed the nearest waste basket and did so.  She had this disgusted, still judgmental look on her face and said \u201cgreat, now I have to clean that out on top of everything else I have to do.\u201d\n\nDone with her bullshit, I said \u201cYeah I gathered that you don\u2019t like doing your job from the moment you opened your mouth.  Least you know I\u2019m not faking now though.\u201d  She then rushed through the process of registering me and sent me out without a word.  \n\nWhen we left the hospital my roommate told me I had acted like a \u201cKaren\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t have spoken to her that way because I \u201chave no idea how hard her job is.\u201d  I responded \u201cWell I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s my problem.  She chose that field for herself, she doesn\u2019t get to take her anger and dissatisfaction with her own career out on distressed patients and expect them to be fine with it.\u201d\n\nShe just responded \u201cWow, you\u2019re seriously entitled and I don\u2019t even know how to move forward with this conversation.  Hopefully you gain some perspective.\u201d\n\nLike what?? What exactly am I missing here.
