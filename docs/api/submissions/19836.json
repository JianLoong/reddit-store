My roommate had to get a wheelchair for me to wheel me through the parking lot because any position besides sitting curled up in some way was excruciatingly painful and I would end up vomiting.  \n\nSo we wait a bit for triage and when we get in this triage woman already seems incredibly snarky.  She made a face when I was wheeled in as if she thought I was faking.  My suspicions were confirmed when I was hunched over silently crying while trying to answer questions and instead of just politely asking me to sit up (or asking me if that was even a good option for me at that time), she KICKED my chair and said \u201csit up, you\u2019re not geriatric you\u2019re dramatic.\u201d Sure enough as soon as I sat up I needed to vomit, so I grabbed the nearest waste basket and did so.  She had this disgusted, still judgmental look on her face and said \u201cgreat, now I have to clean that out on top of everything else I have to do.\u201d\n\nDone with her bullshit, I said \u201cYeah I gathered that you don\u2019t like doing your job from the moment you opened your mouth.
