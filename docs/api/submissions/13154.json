The land backs up to a river and is one of the main things that made us want to buy the house.  At the closing, the previous owners let us know that some neighbors will cut through our land to access trails in the back (not sure at that point who\u2019s land it is or if it\u2019s public) but they are walking through our yard for a good portion to get back there.  Some people take their dogs (multiple times a day) while others like to go four wheeling back there (technically not allowed and some people get fined). \n\nWhen they first said something my initial reaction was that it wouldn\u2019t bother me at all and is far enough out of view for me to not notice/care.  The previous owner also told us they are really respectful people who came to him before they moved and asked if they thought they could still use it once we moved in (they had this previous arrangement with him after he got upset and told them he\u2019d block it off if they weren\u2019t considerate about when and how they accessed it).  He rightfully told them he doesn\u2019t know and they will have to introduce themselves to us and ask when we move in.  So I\u2019ve been expecting them to come by, but they haven\u2019t.  However, I\u2019ve already seen them multiple times cutting through our yard.  \n\nIt turns out, it bothers me more than I thought. I don\u2019t like that they didn\u2019t come ask, and it\u2019s much more in sight than I realized.  When I look out in my yard I can clearly see them.  The other issue is I have 2 dogs of my own who get riled up when they see other dogs in their yard.  I\u2019m also 38 weeks pregnant and want to make sure I feel safe in my new home as we\u2019re about to welcome our new baby. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I blocked off the access point on my land that has a trail that leads through our yard for locals to get to other trails in the back?", "created_utc": 1679753239, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121mvz0/wibta_if_i_blocked_off_access_to_my_land_that/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's your property and if you don't enforce the boundaries, these folks could convince a neighbor to try to get adverse possession on that part of the land.
