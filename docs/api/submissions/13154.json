I would nip this in the bud ASAP, for a number of reasons:\n\n1). It's *your* property now. Neighbors do not have any sort of agreement with *you*.\n\n2) If something were to happen on your property, you could be held liable.\n\n3) If people keep using it as a trail, it could eventually come under eminent domain (public has legal right to use it since they've been doing it for so long).\n\nWe had the SAME thing happen to us when we moved 3 years ago, but our neighbors ride their damned horses on our property to access other trails. Despite having had polite conversations, sending certified mail,  and many email reminders and posted signs, people still ride their horses on our land leaving horsepoop, destroying parts of the lawn, and riling up my dogs.  This has been going on for us for 3 years, but we want to handle it diplomatically. These are our neighbors after all and we live in a smallish town.\n\nIn the interest of being a good neighbor, I  suggest you reach out to the neighbors to introduce yourselves. Start casually before escalating. You can nicely say you are not comfortable with your property being used to access the trails for liability reasons or because your dog  is territorial (I don't know if that's true, but I think it's ok to say so in a note to the neighbors!) or \"because your lawyer advised against it.\" Whatever. You really don't need any excuse. It is your property. Period.  For us, the next step was a letter reiterating the same thing (our issue was regarding the liability of horses on land we didn't maintain for horseriding), cc'ing our lawyer, and sending it certified mail. \"Private property\" signs were our next step, to be followed by full out blocking the path. (That's the step we are about to take, ourselves. We keep moving forward with smiles on our faces!)\n\nI hope you have better luck than we've had. Like I said, we do want to be good neighbors, but we don't want to get the pants sued off of us for a trespasser's mishap on our land. I think by at least making it clear, even casually, that you're not ok with your land being used as a shortcut is a good place to start. Escalate as necessary. Do NOT let that stretch of land become eminent domain. Then you'll really have a mess on your hands.

Folks were driving through the property at breakneck speeds, mowing their tractors over our flowers, never asked permission despite assurance from the landlord that they were informed of new tenants, and essentially we were told to go f**ck ourselves by a bunch of locals when we expressed concern that our dogs or farm animals could be hurt. \n\nMonths of fighting back and forth and even with the law on our side ended in death threats and threats of property damage to my husband and I. Did I mention there were two alternate trails leading the exact same way? The one running through our property was one minute shorter and less muddy and that was part of the reason. The other reason we had spat in our faces was \"We've always done it this way so who are you to come and change that. We'll do what we want because we can.\" Didn't help that I was a foreigner, but my husband was actually from the area and they still spewed racist things at the end of it all.\n\n It made our lives so miserable that we LEFT THE COUNTRY because I realized I could not raise my kid in this kind of poor excuse for a civilized community. \n\nI'm so guarded now when I hear things like this.
