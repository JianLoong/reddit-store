I would nip this in the bud ASAP, for a number of reasons:\n\n1). It's *your* property now. Neighbors do not have any sort of agreement with *you*.\n\n2) If something were to happen on your property, you could be held liable.\n\n3) If people keep using it as a trail, it could eventually come under eminent domain (public has legal right to use it since they've been doing it for so long).\n\nWe had the SAME thing happen to us when we moved 3 years ago, but our neighbors ride their damned horses on our property to access other trails. Despite having had polite conversations, sending certified mail,  and many email reminders and posted signs, people still ride their horses on our land leaving horsepoop, destroying parts of the lawn, and riling up my dogs.  This has been going on for us for 3 years, but we want to handle it diplomatically. These are our neighbors after all and we live in a smallish town.\n\nIn the interest of being a good neighbor, I  suggest you reach out to the neighbors to introduce yourselves. Start casually before escalating. You can nicely say you are not comfortable with your property being used to access the trails for liability reasons or because your dog  is territorial (I don't know if that's true, but I think it's ok to say so in a note to the neighbors!) or \"because your lawyer advised against it.\" Whatever. You really don't need any excuse. It is your property. Period.  For us, the next step was a letter reiterating the same thing (our issue was regarding the liability of horses on land we didn't maintain for horseriding), cc'ing our lawyer, and sending it certified mail. \"Private property\" signs were our next step, to be followed by full out blocking the path. (That's the step we are about to take, ourselves. We keep moving forward with smiles on our faces!)\n\nI hope you have better luck than we've had. Like I said, we do want to be good neighbors, but we don't want to get the pants sued off of us for a trespasser's mishap on our land. I think by at least making it clear, even casually, that you're not ok with your land being used as a shortcut is a good place to start. Escalate as necessary. Do NOT let that stretch of land become eminent domain. Then you'll really have a mess on your hands.

Folks were driving through the property at breakneck speeds, mowing their tractors over our flowers, never asked permission despite assurance from the landlord that they were informed of new tenants, and essentially we were told to go f**ck ourselves by a bunch of locals when we expressed concern that our dogs or farm animals could be hurt. \n\nMonths of fighting back and forth and even with the law on our side ended in death threats and threats of property damage to my husband and I. Did I mention there were two alternate trails leading the exact same way? The one running through our property was one minute shorter and less muddy and that was part of the reason. The other reason we had spat in our faces was \"We've always done it this way so who are you to come and change that. We'll do what we want because we can.\" Didn't help that I was a foreigner, but my husband was actually from the area and they still spewed racist things at the end of it all.\n\n It made our lives so miserable that we LEFT THE COUNTRY because I realized I could not raise my kid in this kind of poor excuse for a civilized community. \n\nI'm so guarded now when I hear things like this.

My job is to manage public lands in an area where we have lots of private property that borders on public lands. This is a chronic issue, unfortunately.\n\nTalk to them. That's the first thing to do: when you see them, go talk to them. \n\nBut here's my suggestion if this land is managed by a government agency: at my agency when adjacent landowners call and let us know about ATVs crossing their property to access \"our\" land, we typically increase patrols in the area. And we are getting into spring now so it's likely this issue will increase, so start forming that relationship now. Keep it positive, that you need their help, rather than an attitude like they must help you (because really, they don't have to. Your land isn't their responsibility. But mostly we try to be good neighbors. And from the tone of your post I doubt you'd take that route, just trying to be complete). \n\nAdditionally, and this is important: the agency that owns that property will have access to lots of info you need: especially easements that may be on your property (for example my area has lots of flowage easements, giving the government the right to flood private property along a lake or river, and among other limitations no habitable structures may be built on that land even though it's your private property). Start with the local office, they may refer you to their their real estate division. \n\nDepending on the agency and specifics they may be willing to put up no trespassing or no ATV signs. Fencing agreements where they may pay for part of the cost of a fence are sometimes possible, usually there has to be a public benefit (and keeping ATVs out of an unauthorized or protected area may be applicable). Or occasionally we will take some BFRs (big f*cking rocks) out and block access routes at the property line. \n\nI suggest blocking off/fencing and posting no trespassing signs on the front side of your property. I would give people a chance to get used to that before further escalation.

Try to talk to these neighbors and come to an agreement. The reasoning is that these neighbors have been legally using the prior owner\u2019s property, now your property, with his permission, and this may have granted them a prescriptive easement. Depending on where you live, this could escalate into quite a nasty legal battle. in 2021 we got a new neighbor who delivered letters to seven neighbors (including ourselves) demanding, not asking, that we stop using a trail that we have been using for 18 years as it does run across her property (when we moved in it was vacant land). She alienated everyone immediately and refused to discuss any kind of compromise or agreement with anyone. This will be a civil matter, and the police will not be able to do anything about it. We retained a lawyer who was able to research easements and property lines in our area, and we do own a prescriptive easement that allows us access to our neighbor\u2019s property.

The legalities are so geographical based that this is not the forum to ask for advice. You need to consult a land law person to find out what you're legally allowed to do and what could cause a court case if you went ahead and blocked off access. \n\nYou said yourself - you don't know if it's your land or public land. And you can get in to a lot of trouble for blocking off public land as private. You need to consult someone with an actual legal knowledge on this topic\n\nI would suggest going to the people rather than waiting for them to come to you. While a move might be obvious to the movers involved, they may be unaware that the original person they cleared things with is no longer living in the house and the new owner would like more consideration than currently is being given. Sometimes we get so upset over a perceived slight that we don't even realize the other person doesn't even know we exist. \n\n  \nI genuinely mean no ill will with this comment and know how frustrating others' lack of consideration can be.

We knew all the kids we went to scjool with. Ebery one knew everyone. Not anymore. Had to build multiple new schools.  It was a working class idyllic place. Then wealthy tech people moved in. Jeff Bezos built a gigantic warehouse here. All the trees gone. Condos. Apartments. Shopping mall. Etc. And once large beautiful homes here were for 200,000. now go for 1.5 million. Massive over priced housing developments. They pushed everyone out that grew up here in generations, in the woods. Local lake is so dirty now  it fucking sucks. It guts me. Old walking trails gone... old hangout spots, gone. Old access points, gone. \n\nBut when it comes to your backyard, idk. I think I would definitely struggle with it. Especially with th liability. I guarantee if someones kid got hurt, drowned. Etc they try and sue.
