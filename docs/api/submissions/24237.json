In my country inflation is insane and cigs get the most of tax but a packet of 20 cigs cost 1.7$ at the moment. The most expensive ones are less than 2.

Also, he damaged your working environment. That smoke could break the oven as well, especially with the package in. I MAYBE would get if he left it there and you put your food on top of them ON PURPOSE  and YOU burned it. But since an oven is not where cigs reside, it is a huge maybe. You even had to clean... seriously i forgot about your position but that is a fireable offense imo.", "Yeah, if the cigarettes weren't burned I would have not throw them away. \n\nIt was 2 cigarettes, not a whole pack.

I hope you're gonna be able to enjoy where you're going even with school :D", "Couldn't see the pic  \ud83d\ude05 but if it was 2 cigs, a smoker knows to let it dry up just a bit and then hold it over a lighter... also, cigs cause awful smells to ones that do not smoke. And it is an oven... i mean... wth?! \ud83d\ude02\n\nThank you, i am a nerd i love school \ud83d\ude02 I will definitely enjoy it since there are 400+ femicide cases in my country per year...", "I am sorry to hear that. In my country too femicide and violence towards women had increase. Working at night can be very stressful.\n\nI'm glad you'll be able to enjoy and maybe have less stress where you're going :D\n\nI was the nerd at my school too haha! No shame ;)"]}
