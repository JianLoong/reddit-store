He works really long hours while he is away so he is tired on weekends. \n\nA month ago we had a beautiful picnic with our child, just the three of us. And, it was extra special because it was at the botanical gardens where we got married. Our child hasn\u2019t been here before. I wanted to take my time and enjoy the gardens, walk around after lunch and soak up the sunshine. He did not want to walk around because he was tired which I thought was fine even though I was disappointed but took our child for a walk without him. Any way on the way home he was complaining about how tired he was. When we got home he went for a nap. I got all the housework and cleaning done like I normally do on a Sunday but the afternoon became evening and he was still taking his \u201cme time\u201d so I got dinner in the oven and sorted out my birthday cake. \n\nWhen he joined us for dinner my Dad had arrived to eat with us. After dinner my husband got himself some beers and sat down to watch sports with my Dad. I got our child ready for bed and I asked him to help. Our child was having a difficult time drifting off and usually I will drive around for a little bit to help bubba find sleep. He didn\u2019t want to help or take bubba for a drive (he couldn\u2019t anyway he was drinking). But I got really, really pissed off. I hadn\u2019t had a moment to myself. I was tired too. So I took bubs for a drive and let my husband know I was in a bad mood. When we got back I put bubs to bed and he was already in bed trying to sleep for his early flight. I kinda got so mad about this. He heard me stomping around and came out of the bedroom and told me to keep quiet he had to sleep. Well, I lost it. I called him a few names, grabbed my keys and stormed out. I eventually came home after about two hours and slept on the couch. \n\nHe thinks I was overreacting and he didn\u2019t do anything wrong because he had to get an early flight and works away all week. I don\u2019t think I am. It\u2019s only my birthday once a year. We don\u2019t bother with things like Valentine\u2019s Day or other commercial holidays. For me birthdays and anniversaries are important. He ended up getting to the airport with almost no sleep and had a terrible week at work from that fatigue. I want to apologise to him but I also think he needs to apologise to me as well. \n\nI don\u2019t normally expect him to do much on weekends. I also work full time 40+ hours a week and I am the sole parent for 5 days straight (7 really, he spends most weekends resting himself for Monday).", "created_utc": 1683217730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137scs6/aita_on_my_birthday_for_storming_out/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't see from my first or second reading anything he did that would reasonably make you angry. You had a very nice celebration.
