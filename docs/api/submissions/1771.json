The kid being loud during the day is something that they will likely do nothing about. I guess what I\u2019m saying is keep complaining if it helps you vent, but don\u2019t expect any action.

I live in a pretty densely populated area, and while I realize each person only has one birthday per year, there are a lot of people around. Between holidays, birthday parties, anniversary parties, funerals, sweet sixteens, quincea\u00f1eras, and just because parties, sometimes it's day after day after day of parties.

You're the asshole.", "Esh but go for it.", "Soft YTA - Most of the noise the child makes that you hear is during the day since you work night shifts. Your party was at night when people are trying to sleep so there is a little bit of a difference. I don\u2019t have experience with autistic children, but I\u2019m sure it is distracting for them at bedtime if there is a loud party below them. You also only reported them since you think they reported you. You don\u2019t know for certain if it was them or only them; maybe several neighbors had the same compliant and discussed it with each other. This might become an ugly situation with your neighbors if it becomes a \u201creport battle\u201d amongst you all.", "Yta because you did it for revenge. A party which I don't believe was done by midnight is much louder then An autistic child.

It was one day, she let everyone know and was okay with turning down the music if it became an issue. And everything was done by midnight.\n\nMeanwhile, with theirs, it's a daily occurrence.

Not in a lot of cases.\n\nCan the autistic child's parents have a crumb of consideration for their neighbours and acknowledge the disruption they cause? Yes.\n\nIt was one night and she gave them a heads up. There was no history of her being a noisy neighbour.

It's DAY time. She was being petty. The party was at night. You assume op gave them a heads up. And that she has never been noisy. The autistic child's parents can acknowledge the noise their kid makes during the DAY but what should they do with the kid? They can try and try to keep the child quiter it won't happen. Therefor she was petty.", "NTA - I hope they learn THEIR lesson (i.e., those that live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones).

I would report him every time he makes a noise. Every single time.", "NTA, you were nice and a very good neighbour when you went to them any told them about your party and they should have text you like you asked  if the noise was problematic. Considering they live above you they should also have considered the noise you hear from them and yes their child is autistic and will make more noise than you living alone. My sister had a similar problem a few years ago, she lives alone and I'd gone from 7-6 Mon - Fri and a family with three kids moved above her . It's an old stately home converted into apartments so a lot of modern work to dampen noise was not permitted by law so upstairs apartments are meant to have carpet and this family removed the carpet and put in wooden  floors, so hence a lot of noise . My sister never complained about the noise but they complained about her, the noise of her shower, the noise of her washing machine ( she had a yard and it washing machine was outside in a brick built shed, so they couldn't hear ) they even complained of noise from her apartment when she was not there. She eventually decided to move so the For Sale sign went up , during a residents meeting the above apartments landlord was present and his tenants asked him could they sell the apartment they are in and let them rent the one he has for sale as it's much more suitable for them and the apartment they had always wanted , their face when he said sorry that apartment has nothing to do with me, it's Js property", "NTA what does it matter what it\u2019s like? You\u2019ve been understanding and ignoring the noises they make all the time and the one time you have people over AND warn your neighbors AND give them a way to contact you they report you. They set the new ground rules, you\u2019re just following them"]}
