We wanted to throw an engagement party and let our families get to know each other better. \n\nMy sister (Avery - 31F) who has been the favourite among all family members our whole lives, came back home the week before the engagement party. She's been travelling all over the world (SouthEast Asia, Africa, Middle East) as a physician and now opted for a change in her life.\n\nShe has always had the spotlight. Even in my high school graduation (she wasn't even there), everyone mentioned how amazing she was (because we went to the same school) and how I had filled in her footsteps. Wherever she goes, she just makes everyone else disappear.\n\nBefore the party, I told her how this party was important for both Ben and I. I also asked her to for once, let the day be about me. She agreed. During the party, everyone from my side of the family just briefly saw us and went to Avery to ask her about her adventures in Uganda or Yemen. \n\nIn just half an hour, she had the whole family around her. I called her out and said she needed to try and not take the spotlight once more. She said I was being ridiculous and it was not her fault she had a life that people wanted to know about. \n\nI told her she could either go back inside and keep a low profile for the rest of the night or leave the party and talk about herself as much as she pleased. She called me a pathetic and jealous and left. My parents are mad at me and are saying I should have understood the situation and made a better judgement.

For one, it's not Avery's fault that people are curious about her life, but on the other hand, you addressed this with her.  You asked her to let your engagement party be about you and she agreed.  \n\nIf she can manage becoming a physician, she should also be able to manage diverting attention away from herself.  She ignored your request. She's the AH.  While your parents may certainly be proud of her, they should be proud of both their daughters and understand this, they're also the AH's here.  This does not bode well for your wedding.\n\nNTA", "Soft YTA. I understand that it must've been terrible growing up in your sister's shadow, OP, but realistically I'm confused as to what you wanted her to do? If she had sat down and refused to speak to anyone, she'd STILL have been \"stealing the attention\" because everyone would be wondering why she's acting so weird. \n\nUnfortunately this was a lose/lose situation for both you and your sister. I think it might be best to try to work on your own issues regarding this before the wedding instead of expecting this plan to work in a different setting.", "YTA, mostly to yourself. You have said that Avery was the one people was focusing on even in your graduation, when she wasn't even there. Then you don't have an Avery problem, you have a family problem. Even  if Avery goes away, you are not going to get the kind of attention you want from your family, so let it go and enjoy your wedding's festivities. Don't be so focused on who and what people are talking about, because the other option is going to be to not invite anyone of your family and I don't think you are going to be happy about that either. So enjoy yourself regardless of Avery and don't focus so much on her. If you repeat this at your wedding, you can either don't invite Avery and everyone will be talking about how you didn't invite her and why, and if you do, you will be focused on her and her interactions with people and won't enjoy yourself. Let it go, is not going to make you happy.", "Sister relationships can be really triggering, which is probably why you sound younger than your actual age here, but I don't see how you're not TA in this situation. What did you honestly expect your sister to do? Tell everyone that she's not at liberty to discuss her life? That's just unrealistic and would create an awkward situation for anyone who tried to talk with her. What's next--banning her from your wedding because the people talking to her won't be focused on basking in YOUR presence? Based on your story told in your own words, your sister hasn't done anything wrong. She's right: you need to deal with your jealousy.", "YTA- this is a party where family and friends are gathering. You are asking your sister to not be social with people. If someone comes up to her and asks her about her travels, is she supposed to say, I\u2019ll happily discuss them another day, but today, let\u2019s only talk about my sister\u2019s engagement to Ben. \n\nYou have a lot of unresolved resentment and jealousy towards your sister- the fact that her mere memory could ruin your graduation is evidence of that. She did nothing wrong (other than potentially not attend the graduation, but sounds like that is your preference?) and you still point out people saying nice things about her as a stain on your day. \n\nSo, figure out how you are going to get over your jealousy or we will anxiously await the AITA post about how she ruined your wedding by her perfect hair and makeup and sparkling conversation. \n\nBottom line: your jealousy is a you problem, not her problem.", "YTA. I get it, it sucks to be in someone else\u2019s shadow, but your sister hasn\u2019t done anything wrong here. There is definitely a strong sense of jealousy here. Engagement parties are fun, but they weren\u2019t going to spend the entire duration talking only about you, of course they are naturally curious about what your sister had been up to.", "YTA. Your sister isn't the problem here; the people who you feel were ignoring you are the actual issue.\n\nI hate to say it, but the reality is that hearing a person talk about their experiences in Yemen and Uganda would be a lot more interesting to most people than a wedding. If you wanted your sister to make herself small and silent, you shouldn't have invited her.", "This post stinks of bitterness and jealousy, anyone stating that the sister should have refused to talk or diverted the conversation towards the OP is both self entitled and delusional. The fact that she has borne a grudge since graduation (which her sister did not attend) and that the rest of the family are calling her TA just goes to show how out of touch with reality the OP is. I actually wonder if OP\u2019s sister is that great a person that they travelled abroad to give OP some time to build her own life without feeling overshadowed and give her some space to develop herself. OP YTA!", "(Edited for a typo)\n\nListen, it sounds like a hard truth that your sister actually is more awesome than you.  \n\nPeople don\u2019t want to hang around with the average when there is great success and inspirational people around.\n\nSure, one should always make an attempt not to outshine the host that is being celebrated. That is just common decency. But if she wasn\u2019t actively seeking out the attention, then the problem is with you and not with your sister.\n\n\nAlthough sometimes we want things to be all about us, that\u2019s not the way the world works. I think you need to grow up and stop acting like a little teenage girl.\n\nI\u2019m going to say that you are not TA, but rather you need to stop pretending you\u2019re the princess in a movie and realize her accomplishments far overshadow your desire to be Instagram famous.", "YTA \n\nShe just got back and the family wants to know about her travels.\n\nDo you expect everyone to sit around and talk about you and Ben all night give you some prizes.\n\nIf this was your wedding day maybe I'd understand but you are being stupid this is just a party.\n\n>and let our families get to know each other better. \n\nHow are they supposed to do this when you demand you have the spotlight. Grow up. You just sound jealous.", "YTA. Unless you can point to a specific instance where your sister did something attention-seeking, why are you blaming her for what your family members choose to do? You\u2019ve said that *even when she\u2019s not there* your family makes things about her. So what do you actually expect her to do about it? Why are you upset at her instead of the people you feel are constantly comparing you to her? They are the actual AHs here if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. \n\nThe main purpose of a family event celebrating a milestone is indeed to celebrate that milestone, but it\u2019s not reasonable to expect that people won\u2019t want to catch up and talk about things OTHER than you. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were neglected, or people didn\u2019t offer their congratulations; it sounds like you\u2019re just upset that people were *also* interested in catching up with your sister who\u2019s been gone for a long time. What did you want to happen here? For all of your guests to spend the entire event talking to just you and your fianc\u00e9 about your wedding plans and nothing else? That\u2019s not a reasonable expectation. \n\nThe fact that you want to exclude your sister from important life events just because the attention isn\u2019t 100% on you is seriously childish and self-centered. \n\nI don\u2019t know why so many people seem to feel that it\u2019s socially acceptable for an adult to have a temper tantrum over not getting enough attention.", "YTA What can Avery do other than *attempt* to redirect attention? Its the other people who decide what they are more interested in. Stories about Yemen, or your party. You are jealous of your sister and drove her away when she is really limited in what she could do. How do you not know that she tried to redirect attention away from herself? You are already pretty biased against her and seeing as she has been gone for a while, half an hour of catching up is not that much time in the grand scheme of things. \n\nAlso \"-or leave the party and talk about herself as much as she pleased. \" that is beyond salty, no wonder she left. Why would she stay after you were so rude?", "I really don\u2019t think that it was your sisters fault that people asked her about her life. I\u2019ve been dating a physician for a little over a year now and she\u2019s spent some time overseas doing work in Peru, Bolivia and Thailand and it\u2019s just something that people like to ask about. Every family get together that I\u2019ve brought her to she tends to be the center of attention since people love hearing about crazy medical stories that have happened overseas and even at the hospital she is working at now.\n\nI\u2019m hesitant to say YTA in this situation since I don\u2019t know what exactly your sister was doing to pull the attention towards her. If she was just being polite and answering people\u2019s questions then YTA. If she was going out of her way to bring stuff up and talk about herself then NTA.", "YTA and you sound pathetic and jealous. What did you want her to do? Sit in a corner and stare at a wall?", "YTA.\n\nYou are way too old to be harboring childish jealousy. If you want people to focus on you, be interesting.", "What\u2019s she supposed to do?  Yell, \u201cshut up!  Don\u2019t speak to me at all about my very interesting travels!  For this is my sister\u2019s party and I\u2019ve scorned her for years by existing!\u201d  Grow up.  YTA", "This is a tough one. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel the way you do, but it\u2019s pretty childish to act the way you did. Honestly, I think it looks WAY worse for you to have to go out of your way to dull your sister\u2019s shine. It\u2019s simply not a good look for you. She isn\u2019t doing this on purpose. I\u2019m going to say slight YTA on this.", "Yta. Your sister didn\u2019t do anything but show up and engage in conversation. She didn\u2019t make a big announcement or wear all white or anything like that. It\u2019s bad timing really. Had your sister been settled a bit longer, family would have had the chance to catch up with her one on one outside of your event. \n\nIt also sounds like people said you were following in her footsteps\u2026which is a compliment. They see you as doing as well as her.", "INFO:\n\nOut of curiosity OP, what exactly were you expecting your family to do at this party in regards to paying you attention? People can only say \u2018congratulations on your engagement\u2019 so much, and I\u2019m guessing they already know you and Ben pretty well so they can\u2019t ask questions like \u2018how did you guys meet\u2019 or other relationship questions.\n\nAfter the initial congrats, did you expect everyone to sit there in silence and only speak if it was about you/to you?", "YTA. What is your sister supposed to do, wear a burlap sack and hide in the corner??\n\nBe mad at your FAMILY for not showing you the attention you wanted on a special day. They're at fault here. \n\nAnd get over your jealousy of your sister. She's living her life for herself. You need to do the same.", "Yta, you should blame the people that prefer focussing on your sister instead of blaming her.", "YTA I really don\u2019t get this I\u2019m sorry. Are you informing all of your guests that you and Ben are to be the only topics of conversation? Do you envision everyone sitting around you, watching intently as you breathe and eat? \n\nIt\u2019s kind of sad that you feel this way but forbidding your interesting sister from making conversation that is not about you sounds\u2026not great.", "YTA. The whole post honestly reeks of desperate jealousy. I get why you feel that way, but it isn't her fault. She didn't announce her travels and steal story time about her experiences. People asked her about it. Unless you straight up just wanted her to be silent and not talk, she was going to talk to people. They then make their own decision who they want to talk to. Her experiences sound interesting. \n\nYou said yourself that these people came up to talk to you and give their greetings and congratulations. Were you expecting that you'd have a fawning crowd surrounding you the entire time? An engagement party is to announce and celebrate one thing. That part was already done. Now your guests get to mingle and catch up on other friends and family, because that's what a gathering is. \n\nThe ironic thing is that this is just going to make you even more unlikeable to the people around you.", "YTA\n\nHaving a super accomplished golden child older sibling is tough, but what precisely is she meant to do? It's an engagement party, which means it's a party, outside of toasts or something similar it's going to be regular conversation. People aren't going to make sure they only talk about the betrothed because it's an engagement party. \n\nIt's clear your sister is a source of deep insecurity for you, and that's a hard thing to deal with and perhaps your family helped create this, but in this instance YTA because you basically made a scene because people were interested in your sister's life.", "YTA I think you have unrealistic expectations for a lot of things. Maybe you\u2019re caught up and just romanticizing what picture perfect \u201cengagement party\u201d looks like but people will mingle and talk about other things beside you.", "YTA.  And jealous.  What you really wanted to do,and should have, was ask her not to attend so that people that haven't seen her in a long wouldn't want to ask her about her travels. The only solution.How are you supposed to tell people, \"Oh no, don't be  asking about what I was doing?\" This is Opie's party.", "YTA. While I understand your frustration, I cant see her making a mistake. People have not seen her for years, and tbh, you want to entertain your guests some hours talking about engagement?", "Hard YTA. She didn't show up and try to steal the show. She was invited and people wanted to talk to her.", "OP has thirty minutes of good stories, Sis has hours of them.\n\nIf anyone with a fascinating life shows up to a party, they'll immediately draw attention. If someone brings their very cute baby to a party, people will gush over it. If there's a sweet puppy, it will be pet and played with.\n\nOP is NTA for being jealous of the attention her high achieving, adventures sister gets.\n\nBut OP is TA because:\n- regulating your guests interests is gauche\n- causing a scene because people are listening to the incredible stories is Awful\n\nIf there's more than 2 people at the table, people will talk to other people.", "ESH\n\nYou said it yourself, people talk of her even when she is not around (what can she do about it ????). At the party, people went to her to ask her questions about her travels. She didn't try to steal the attention. And honestly, her travels sound amazing! Of course people want to hear about them. Individuals, when in a big group like this, tend to talk to each other as well. What were you expecting ? For them to sit around you and just listen to you and not talk among themselves ? You sound extremly bitter and jealous. YTA.\n\nSpoiler alert: At your wedding day, your guests will talk to each other as well. They won't sit in silence during the reception and wait around for you to do or say something.\n\nOn the other hand, it would have been easy for her to deflect the conversation to other subjects and explained that, today, she wants the attention to be on you, which she didn't. On this, she was the AH.\n\nAnd finally, have you told this to your parents ? Have you tried explaining to them how you feel about your sister and how everybody has always compared you to her. You sound like people might have expected you to be more like your sister and that's not fair. You should have a talk with them. They are the AH for always putting your sister on a pedestal and comparing you to her instead of letting you be your own person.\n\nI think you have a lot of work to do with all your family.", "YTA. Please don't make the rest of your wedding planning about how much attention you get as well. Parties are for people to see each other and talk to each and enjoy each other's company. It was unrealistic to think people would only talk to you and only about your engagement all night. You need to get to the root of your issues with your sister and work through them- this is entirely a you problem.", "YTA \n\nLook, I get that it sucks to be the less interesting sibling. It does suck. That\u2019s true.\n\nBut your sister IS interesting. That isn\u2019t her fault and she can\u2019t control that people are interested in her life and want to hear about it. \n\nYou do sound jealous and insecure, because you are. Again, I get it. But this isn\u2019t your sister fault and I really don\u2019t get what you want her to do here without being rude and refusing to talk with people.", "YTA - Sympathetic all the way here.\n\nBut - Avery is right. It isn't her fault she is doing things find exciting and different. \n\nWhat I don't truly understand is, say 100 people came to your engagement party, are they all to stand around and wait on you the whole time? They are going to talk to other people, sister included, and then as you are passing by grab you and say hello.\n\nThere does seem to be a lot of resentment and jealousy here. This is either from within or very likely driven by family.", "> In just half an hour, she had the whole family around her. \n\nAnd everybody clapped, right? \n\nYTA. Just because you are the guest of honor that doesn\u2019t mean people are only allowed to talk about you or to you. \n\nGuests at a party are supposed to mingle and talk to each other. It is perfectly normal to chat with other guests and ask them what they\u2019ve been up to. \n\nI\u2019m genuinely curious as to what you expected the conversations to be all night. You expected them to discuss nothing but you?", "YTA. She wasn't dancing on tables, falling around drunk or seeking attention. All she did was exist and make chit-chat with her family. What was she supposed to do, hide in a cupboard, or refuse to speak to people? This is about you and your relationship with your family. That is something you need to address with them, not your sister.", "YTA it\u2019s not your sister\u2019s fault that people are interested in her travels/life. It sounds more an issue you have with your family vs just her. I think this is just a jealousy issue you need to work on.", "YTA because you aren't actually helping yourself get the positive attention you deserve. \n\nShe could have just told a couple stories and then everyone would move on. Now your outburst is the bad behavior everyone will talk about. \n\nI know it hurts. I was the glass child. But just so you know, actually getting the attention doesn't heal the wound. You just realize they could have tried your whole life and didn't want to. You have to find a new circle to shine in and keep your sister out of it. \n\nAlso, what was your sister supposed to do? Realistically, in that situation, it would take extreme social finesse to redirect attention to you without making you look petulant and controlling.", "YTA. You\u2019re insecure and jealous of your sister simply existing. She didn\u2019t summons people over to her. She didn\u2019t do anything to steal attention. She was there for your party and other people were interested in her. So that\u2019s her fault? Seriously?", "Yeah YTA", "Yta.. huge jealousy issues!", "why didn\u2019t you just\u2026. join the conversation ? although sister relationships are very nuanced and sometimes hell (known from personal experience), this feels like the type of behaviour i\u2019d exhibit around the age of 14-16\u2026\n\nlight yta but hard grow up. for your own sake.\n\nalso pls start throwing better parties, this one sounds depressing if it was always all supposed to be about you\u2026 i thought it was about letting your \u201cfamilies get to know each other\u201d lol", "YTA.", "YTA, why'd you even invite her?", "YTA.  \n\nYour guests came to celebrate your engagement.  Their presence there celebrates your engagement.  Expecting them to not talk to each other about what's going on in their lives, particularly when you framed this as people getting to know each other, is unreasonable.  \n\n Your sister is not doing anything to hurt you.  There's no reason people being interested in her should cause you distress.  They came to your party because they're interested in you too.", ">(she wasn't even there)\n\nYTA.  You're blaming her for everyone else's actions.  Rather than hold the proper people accountable for their actions, you blame her for everything everyone else does that you do not like.", "YTA\n\nYou gave her more attention than anyone else there. She didn't steal the spotlight, you handed it to her and made an ass of yourself in the process. Big yikes.", "Yta, I get it, feeling like your always in your sister's shadow. But you mention even when she's not there ppl ask and attention gravitate to her. \n\nYou seem to have a family problem not a sister problem. I could see if she didn't come everyone asking where is she, is she traveling? Etc.", "YTA. \n\nBased solely on what your wrote in your post which is all we have to go off of, it is the rest of your family you should be mad at, not your sister.\n\nFrom what you wrote it seems that your sister did nothing to steal the spotlight other than simply existing at your party.  She didn't run around gathering everyone up to listen to her stories, they all came on their own.\n\nSo if there's anyone to be mad at it should be the rest of the guests, not your sister.\n\nYou owe her an apology.", "yes, YTA. It's normal people talk about various topics at the party. Realistically, what are they supposed to talk about for hours to appease you? \"-How nice they are engaged! -Haha, yeah. -She has such a nice dress. -I know, right? -Hope wedding will be fun. -Uhh, yeah.\"", "YTA. There are all kinds of people in a family. Some who are extroverts, others who are introverts. Some people who have seemingly exciting lives, while others have more routine lives. You cannot control the dynamic of conversation. That is a level of control that is frankly insane, and would prevent me from ever wanting to be around such people. Your sister did not actively do anything other than simply attend an answer peoples questions. To those poster, she say she could\u2019ve shut down the conversation, it was a friggin party! \n\nAre you going to now not invite her to the wedding? Because God forbid someone might approach her to engage her in conversation? Why can\u2019t you simply be happy with the love of your life and not require that everyone genuflect in front of you and gaze adoringly at you for hours to the exclusion of absolutely everyone in attendance? You sound insufferable.", "YTA on this one. I can understand being frustrated that your sister stole the spotlight growing up, but there\u2019s clearly jealousy clouding your judgement here. People at events are going to catch up about their lives, if your sister has been out of the country then that\u2019s what she\u2019ll talk about if asked. I don\u2019t think she meant for an audience per se, but I\u2019m sure she was just telling an interesting story. Expecting the conversation to be about only you and your engagement all night is a strange expectation. Your jealousy and temper tantrum ruined your party, not your sister.", "OP, you're the AH. Surely you knew your relatives would ask her about her work abroad. The party was ruined by your jealousy & insecurity. You need help to get over it before you marry.", "YTA. \n\nShe didn\u2019t grab a mike and start talking about all the things she\u2019s doing. She was asked about them. Was she supposed to not talk? You might be perceiving this as a slight against you because you have a history of experiencing being in the shadow of someone else. You took out your life\u2019s frustrations on your sister and made it all about how you kicked her out of your party. That seems like a dumb hill to die on.", "I\u2019ve gotta go with, softly, YTA. In my family, I\u2019m Avery, and it gets old. It\u2019s not her fault people are more interested in her life than yours, and honestly it\u2019s likely there\u2019s a reason\u2026 you haven\u2019t mentioned any specifics about your life, but it\u2019s honestly likely that hers is just a lot more interesting than yours. Sorry, but that\u2019s just how it goes sometimes. I get your feelings, but dude, jealously isn\u2019t a good look on anyone.", "YTA. Your sister isn\u2019t hogging the attention. You are obviously jealous of her accomplishments. Was it her fault at your graduation when she wasn\u2019t even there? Did you expect everyone at your engagement party to spend the entire evening talking with you and about you? your insecurity is showing.", "Soft YTA \nYou have a lot of resentment toward your sister, and I think you also are jealous. To be honest, it sounds like you have a low self esteem and that is something you should work on instead of taking it on your sister. If you know what a wonderful person you are (like your fianc\u00e9e does, he is marrying you!), it does not really matter if you get less attention than your sister.\n\nIt is natural that people were interested in your sister\u2019s stories since she just got back. It does not sound like she herself promoted  it or tried to steal the spotlight.\n\nI would work on yourself, the relationship with your sister and forget about the competition.", "YTA, you sound jealous and childish. \n\nEvery single girl I knew who got married in her early or mid 20s was absolutely obsessed with her wedding and made a huge deal about it. \n\nYour wedding might be really important to you, but to other people, especially extended family, it really isn't that interesting. They've been to lots of weddings. You sound like you expect them to be fawning all over you as The Bride and not interacting with other family members and catching up on family news.\n\nExpecting your sister not to talk to anyone about her life when asked is unreasonable.", "YTA - What did you realistically expect her to do? People will talk and mingle however they want to during the party. How did you expect other people to react towards you in this situation? Crowd around and ask you about the wedding etc?\n\nGuess what? On your wedding day, after the ceremony, most guests will not give a shit what you do next, what the speeches are about, the first dance, that you're cutting your cake, etc.  Most guests are there to have a good time with everyone. Once the food and drinks are out, most of the attention will not be on you anymore.", "YTA - you really just sound jealous of her and it doesn\u2019t appear like she\u2019s trying to steal your attention. She\u2019s had an interesting life and people wanted to know more. She has accomplished different things and your family are the ones giving her attention. You should have spoken to your parents and not to her about this if this was your concern. It\u2019s not her fault everyone wanted to hear about her travels and work after being away for a year. Everyone already knew about your engagement, likely for months, and it wasn\u2019t new to them.\n\nShe returned from her travels likely to for your event. I really don\u2019t see what she did as wrong, it certainly wasn\u2019t intentional and there isn\u2019t much she could have done short of being rude to people by saying, \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me\u201d.", "YTA.

People haven't seen her in ages...and what she's been doing is objectively interesting, in the sense that nobody at the engagement party has had that kind of life experience.\n\nYes, your sister could have said she wasn't going to talk about her own life because the day was yours (I notice you said \"let the day be about me\" and not \"me and my fiance\"), but honestly, that would have caused even more conversation and drama. She was kind of jerk to call you pathetic, but truly, you ARE jealous...and from what you posted, most of the things you're jealous of aren't even her fault.\n\nI'll say NAH here, but only because I feel sorry for you for - so far - being unable to just enjoy your life even if you aren't naturally in the spotlight as much as your sister is.", "She should have had the manners to turn the questions and conversation around and redirect attention.\n\nNTA", "YTA \n\nYour timing sucks.

The only thing I can offer to you as advise is:\n\n1. Don\u2019t invite her to your parties where family and friends are involved. \n\n2.  Tell your family how hurtful it is for them to flock to her on your special occasions. \n\n3.

The entire party was going to circle around her and her fiance the whole time while they hold court?

If the party was for more than an hour, people tend to make groups and talk amongst themselves. The attention can't always be on the \"main people\" of the party, it is unsustainable. But I think from OP's account that she wants a level of attention from her family, and especially in comparision to Avery, that she can't realistically expect and that is going to make her miserable in the long run. If she is there, she is going to be constantly looking out for anything that she can see as Avery stealing her thunder, being that realistic or not. If she is not there, she is going to get pissed, because people is wondering, even if some people only ask about her once. She can't realistically keep this up and be happy. So I would recommend to let it go and enjoy regardless of the level of attention she perceives is on Avery. Her fixation about how many people is fixated on Avery versus her is only going to make her miserable. After all, she was pissed off by Avery for her stealing her thunder at her graduation, where she wasn't even there. How was that Avery's fault?

This would be a good teaching experience for a toddler- from a woman it\u2019s freakishly grotesque. A lot of AITAH folks seem to be lonely, spiteful and creepy as hell judging by the comments. I no could be on OPs side? Only someone else can go is hyper focused on a nice, more successful person to envy, I guess. Avery didn\u2019t make herself more interesting- or maybe she did- either way, she\u2019s done everything wrong and OP sounds demented. I wonder how her fianc\u00e9 feels about this newly revealed aspect of her personality? He\u2019s probably a drip, too, so he\u2019ll settle for her.

I can't pretend that the few times she is in our country, people on my family is only focused on me, because even if the even is about me, they see her way less. But I still think this is not the issue. OP can't control what their family do or think all the time. It is going to be unsustainable all the time and she is not going to be happy in the long run. What is she going to do at the wedding? Get mad when people is asking where her sister is if she is not invited, and then get madder if she thinks people at her wedding is talking about her, or is she going to be constantly on the outlook in the ceremony or after to see if a lot of people is talking to her if Avery is finally invited? It is unsustainable, and OP is never going to be happy. The attention can't be constantly be in the couple in large and long gatherings and people is going to flock to the person they see less very easily.

I'm quite sure that everyone there congratulated OP, and I'm sure OP's friends (not to mention the groom's guests) were not particularly interested in Avery. It's only natural that the people at a party who know each other will congregate together, especially when it's family members who haven't seen each other in a long time. Should Avery have refused to converse with anyone at the party for fear that she might divulge something interesting about her life, and therefore overshadow OP's marriage? It sounds like a bit much... Catching up with your family is a FAR CRY from a proposal during someone else's wedding, and this griping strikes me as petty/insecure on OP's part.\n\nIf the same group of people had congregated around Aunt Maude to hear the thrilling story of her recent hip replacement, OP wouldn't have cared.

The more chill sister who lives her life instead of making everything a big deal (I\u2019m marrying the love of my life, not just getting married) and calculating who-got-how-much-attention is almost definitely much more endearing, and the scent of (somewhat malicious) neediness isn\u2019t wafting off of her. Malignant neediness is not something that anyone is dying to court at a party. It\u2019s not Sisters fault that her sister isn\u2019t as magnetic as her and she shouldn\u2019t have to dim her light for some jealous, spiteful drama Queen who expects everyone to bend to her desires. Requests and performances like this one almost fully explain why even this gals family isn\u2019t very interested in her. If I heard my cousin complaining about her shower not being all about her and guilting her sister I would be disgusted and steer clear of her aside from one stiff hug before leaving.

I don't blame OP for feeling salty about it. Her parents would have seen that happening, her sister probably would have heard it from their parents and/or OP herself.\n\nIn any other scenario, the sister talking about her adventures probably would have been a sweet interaction. But since OP feels insecure about her older sister stealing the shadow, the older sister should have had diverted the attention and should have mingled with the family without stealing the thunder.

That\u2019s what older relatives enjoy- were just there to do whatever makes them happy as long as it isn\u2019t abusive. Avery didn\u2019t cause this-OP did- and I\u2019m glad that, since OP decided Averyhad to upset someone, she only upset the very selfish, galaxy-brained OP (Al of you saying that it\u2019s normal to expect people to tan about an engagement for hours are fucking weirdos. That\u2019s unnatural and freakish, and those are the facts. Maybe you also wanted a horrible hostage-style party in the high everyone was forced to compliment you-like a trump cabinet meeting- but that\u2019s sick. Find a way to get attention that you deserve; or just don\u2019t get it. Forcing it is abusive and deranged. Fully demented. No one who isn\u2019t boring as fuck has EVER managed to talk about a selfish, catty drip like OP and an engagement for 2 hours. Engagements are boring after 15 minutes, and that\u2019s being quite generous). and not a bunch of innocent aunts and grannies.", "Agitating for attention is always going to end up with you being alone, because it is truly insufferable. It hurts, but it\u2019s a very real fact. People who are begging for attention are really off-putting- they make you physically recoil. Humans were just made that way, and OP can\u2019t control it regardless of the size of the pity party she throws. That\u2019s just part of human nature. Not wanting attention attracts people. And dogs.", "YTA - Potato salad is god's given right to everyone.", "The people who were at the party and disagreed with OP were essentially getting called out by OP for behaving badly, and were having their focus told to leave. They\u2019re not remotely unbiased.", "It all makes perfect sense if older Sis is the golden child. Of course everyone will flock to her and defend her against OP; golden child is always the main event, OP is always the \u2018also-ran\u2019. \n\nThat\u2019s the vibes I\u2019m getting here, especially as it\u2019s easy even for a socialphobe like me to redirect a conversation, let alone a Doctor who deals with sick and / vulnerable people all day long. People flock around? Big deal - move! She would\u2019ve found a way if the only people listening to her stories were Aunt Weird and Uncle Creepy. \n\nShe told those stories because she wanted to, even after being politely asked not to. \n\nOP is NTA, but her family are glaring AHs that play favourites.", "100% OP is exaggerating to make Avery seem worse than she really is.", "It\u2019s so obvious that she is malignant/the problem. How toxic are all of the people who agree with her? I guess they all seethe with jealousy about their own friends and family, too. If you hate/rage-envy those closest to you, you\u2019re probably the problem.\n You\u2019re also absolutely right- OP all but admitted that she was logging in very word said to her sister and waiting to throw this fit. It was the purpose of her party. She ruined her own party, has been a dick to her sister for decades, and wants pity. When it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s the reason no one likes her as much as Avery- her behavior did this and she\u2019s doubling down on it. What a narcissistic monster girl. I love that the public is so dim that they think that the person they would envy must be a narcissist. No, it\u2019s the people who sit around measuring themselves against others and fixating on more successful people. Many, many narcissists are just like OP.

OP\u2019s family were extremely rude to OP and at minimum should be denied any refreshments that OP and her fianc\u00e9 were providing.

She can\u2019t help it that her life is just INTERESTING. People get engaged all the time.", "Exactly. This is definitely not the first time- it sounds like events are measured by OP by calculating how much people pissed her off by acknowledging that Avery exists. She\u2019s mired in jealousy and that doesn\u2019t attract folks to you- it\u2019s repellant. Neediness for attention is a guarantee that you\u2019ll be ignored- it wafts off folks like a at much and is ALWAYS coupled with bitterness and vitriol directed at the wrong folks. People hate that, for good reason. \n\nOP is not a favored family member because she ruins events by making them all about her and attacking someone the family adores. That\u2019s nasty and it shouldn\u2019t be lauded and supported like it is in this thread. The people who know them know who the unkind, attacking drama Queen is here. I can\u2019t see why so many folks support it unless they\u2019re new to socializing or also seethe with rage-envy at close family members who are just minding their own business. I feel so badly for Avery. Having an abusive, jealous sibling is an awful part of some lives. I\u2019m just glad that the family sees that Avery is nice and places the blame where it truly rests. You can sob and say you feel like second-fiddle all day- smart people won\u2019t just agree with you. But other jealous and abusive monsters will support you in droves and attack your poor, more successful sister.

She was angry that people were gathering a bit around Avery just 30 minutes into the party. \n\nPeople talked to OP first and then went to check on the family member who had recently been traveling internationally. This is the most normal of all normal things. The party host is going to be greeting people at the start of a party so you arrive, say your hellos and then chat with other attendees and catch up.\n\nAgain, this was only 30 minutes into the party. Avery clearly hasn\u2019t been hogging all the attention for 45 minutes as you say.", "I mean the fact that even at her high school graduation some how her sister stole the attention when she wasn\u2019t even there is pretty far fetched \n\nAnd I honestly have a hard time believing OPs *entire* family ignored her for an event that was hosted in her and her fianc\u00e9s honor \n\nHer sister must be one hell of a story teller to make that happen", "I read that as OPs side of the family was gathered around Avery, not the in-law side. If it was everyone, then it's a little different. Then they're mingling and getting to know each other.", "But there's a difference in enjoying the attention and gladly standing in the spotlight and talking all about yourself. And have a little averness about the event you are at. \n\nShe could just as easily have as others told. \"Oh, I'll gladly show you the pictures later, Aunty, but I'm dying to hear where they are planning to have the wedding.\" And redirect attention. Not gather the whole party around her. \nThe families were supposed to meet each other and get to know each other. Mother of the bride. Mother of the groom all that. \nIt was an engagement party. It's not a welcome home party. \nShe could engage herself with the couple.", "If Avery has the social skills to tell wondrous stories about her adventures in a way that draws a crowd, she also has the social skills to deflect and not gather a crowd.  \n\nYou're describing this as if Avery is some passive and idle passenger in a situation that she had no control over, and the poor girl was utterly helpless while her simply existing drew attention she had no agency in.  Avery wasn't trapped between a rock and a hard place here, facing questions she simply could not answer without accidentally being massively charismatic and drawing a bunch of attention.\n\nIt's completely within Avery's power to tone it down for an afternoon that's about her sister, and while I don't think she's necessarily an AH for failing to do that, we don't have that much info here - I don't think OP is an AH for asking in advance, and then losing her chill when Avery failed to honour her commitment.  \n\n>She could have easily solved it by engaging herself. Like talk about weddings in Yemen and what she wants here.\n\nOP pushing her way into a conversation about her sister's travels in Yemen to try and make the conversation about hypothetical weddings in Yemen is a lot more petty and reads a lot poorer than asking her sister in advance to try to not draw a crowd.  It easily reads as a lot more AH, even, than OP losing her cool at her sister for doing what she'd agreed not to.\n\nEqually, the two options facing OP should not be \"don't invite Avery\" or \"keep butting into Avery's Story Hour to redirect attention back onto herself\" - Avery is a human being with agency and social skills, and deflecting or deferring a conversation that is going to be a hijack on the main event is a relatively basic social skill.\n\n>For me it sounds like OPs bottled up jealousy ruined her own party. \n\nI don't think this is really the case.  OP knows she resents her sister taking over attention, and maturely went to her sister in advance and discussed the upcoming party, and asked her sister to keep her charisma in check for this one specific event.  That's not bottling.  That's a adult response to a challenging situation, that as described does a completely reasonable job of recognizing that it's not Avery's fault she's got that rizz, or that the family somewhat favored her - but still asking Avery to try to let OP have her own engagement party be about her.  Then Avery didn't try.", "So, in other words, op was supposed to also make the party about her sister? It's not evenly remotely difficult to redirect a conversation.

And to be quite honest I think a doctor who worked in Yemen & Uganda would be much more interesting to me than just another engaged couple. Yes I\u2019m happy for them & will celebrate with them but why is every other topic of conversation out of bounds? Must everyone spend the whole party fawning over the engaged couple?

Come on, that's a hilariously ridiculous suggestion.", "I disagree, if you throw a party for everybody then it is for everybody.

We know from OP's history that she feels like she's in her sister's shadow, and is compared to her sister constantly. If the sister had \"gloating golden child\" energy then I'd say OP was justified. But if she was like, a person at a party? It seems a bit unfair to demand that she stfu or leave. OP could have not invited the sister, or planned it for when the sis is away. I'm leaning towards OP working on their resentment/jealousy, because it harmed OP's own experience of the event, and there were no specific instance of attention-hogging. Sis was a bit ungracious when asked to leave, but I can see why she was annoyed.", "That solution can only work so long and so many times. There's only so long the sister can do that without her monopolizing the couple though.

In that case, OP was perfectly reasonable in expecting her party not be about Avery for once.  The family is busy hanging on Avery, to the exclusion of the fiance's family, which is what the party was about.  In that case, the family would think OP was out of line because she deprived them of their Avery fix.\n\nI'm not saying Avery is to blame here.  I can't tell whether she's just living though what she considers normality or is an attention hog.  However, by what OP has written, I'd have to say she's NTA.", "So Great aunt Mary can\u2019t talk about her incredible cruise because it might deflect from the party?  How idiotic", "Uhh how about you have a party to celebrate with friends and family, not to have them celebrate your existence.", "This is a subreddit about judging people. And their stories. What are you on about....\n\nIt's such a common issue because OP has a severe inferiority complex towards her sister. Not because the sister is hogging the spotlight. \n\nOr did she hog the spotlight at the graduation she didn't attend to?  Which was ruined because someone remarked she had filled in her footsteps. (Which is a completely normal thing to say to a younger sibling going the same route) and Which is actually praise of OP and not the sister.\n\n\nI'm not discounting her story. I'm reading it. You should to.\n\nIt was also a party for the families to meet and get to know each other. Which she explicitly States. Why are you discounting her story?", "Exactly. She\u2019s creating her own unhappiness. If Avery had these expectations, she would be as miserable and mired in dullness as OP. Anyone would. Sometimes someone else gets it hat you wanted, and that doesn\u2019t make them a bad person. It makes them someone you wanted to be like. Hating anyone who has anything you wish you had even if they\u2019re nice and never hurt you is nasty. It\u2019s one of the nastiness things I\u2019ve witnessed. You don\u2019t get to hate nice people just because they got more of what you wanted than you- they didn\u2019t take something you owned or earned form you- attention isn\u2019t finite and if you\u2019re interesting you\u2019ll get it, even if your 29 sisters are fabulous (and these jealous people are the types who actually would take/steal everything from everyone else if they could, because they don\u2019t see or care for people- just them getting \u201ctheirs.\u201d They don\u2019t care about anyone-just attention and things). And it\u2019s a formula for an incredibly unhappy life. If Margot Robbie or Audrey Hepburn or Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived with that mindset she would be miserable (and not famous/successful. She would be stuck in some living room somewhere tallying up slights she thinks her sister inflicted upon her. This mindset gets you stuck).", "My mom and daughter made arrangements, without telling anyone but me, for my 85 year old Great Auntie to attend my daughter's wedding. They also didn't tell Great Auntie where she was going, so it was a surprise reunion all around.\n\nThat surprise got a lot of attention, but in no way overshadowed the wedding because my daughter and son-in-law planned a kick ass event.", "Like once you talk about the wedding: engagement, that takes up\u2026. 10 min?", "The interesting social butterflies of the family are the first people on my invite lists for parties.\n\nThey're the ones that get people opening up and having fun and dancing. I'm perfectly capable of commanding attention for myself when I want it, no matter who is around, and I'm not scared of sharing.\n\nOPs demanding \"you need to isolate yourself because I don't know how to work a room\" is a sign that she is not happy with how she presents herself, only, instead of changing herself to be someone she approves of, she's asking her sister to change so she can feel important.\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with wanting to feel important. Everyone should feel important at their own party. It's important to feel important. It's GOOD to feel important. It's necessary even. A basic need.\n\nWhat OP doesn't see, sadly, is that the importance and attention she would get from shoving her sister into a box will be fake. It's not real. It's a trick.\n\nBecause she doesn't see herself as worthy of it.", "Reread. There\u2019s no way OP didn\u2019t blow this out of proportion. It describes nothing other than some girl fixating on her sister, looking for an imagined slight, salivating at the chance to blow things out of proportion. She wanted to finally be announced as the winner in her one-sided beef with Avery, or ruin her own party. So she chose to ruin her own party.", "Exactly. Even for the people in the comments who think OP is right, it\u2019s a bad choice. You\u2019ll only repel folks (likely some of Ben\u2019s family) when you insist upon yourself to such an alarming degree. And attack an innocent person everyone loves. I\u2019m sure her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family noticed and logged the jealousy and that Avery is innocent here, regardless of how much OP left out in her explanations for her unhinged behavior.", "And especially if they\u2019re Someone Who Works With People We See As Poor And Underprivileged, where attempts to dodge the subject turn into people who\u2019ve experienced neither poverty nor underprivilege speculating about what unspeakable tragedy MUST have occurred.", "Sometimes I feel for parents and how hard it is to raise siblings equally but then I meet parents of girl fraternal twins and find out they nicknamed one, the funny one and the other, the pretty one.  \n\nThe kids were around 6 or 8. Old enough to know and be effected. It\u2019s fucked", "But like, how much of that is really what happened? Like do we really think she was having story time? And even if she was, like how long? Cause it probably isn't gonna last more than 10 mins before everyone breaks apart. Idk, we get one side of the story and it's seething with jealousy so I'm inclined to think it might be embellished.", "Yeah, the way OP tells it. I'm not normally on the \"OP's lying, stories made up\" train, but OP is clearly insanely jealous of her sister. To the point of saying she's always the one getting all the attention first thing. I mean it's a fucking cliche. So for me, I'm kinda thinking she embellished things. Like what kinda weird party is just the whole family gathered around 1 person all night? I'm calling bullshit. I'm sure OP's sister was maybe being a bit of an attention seeker, but I really doubt its how OP painted the picture.", "Uh op wanted the two families to mingle and get to know each other not attend her sister's spontaneous welcome home party she threw herself. I don't think it would have killed Avery to refrain from patting herself on the back for one day.", "What weird mentality is this shit? You throw an engagement party to celebrate with people you like. You celebrate by inviting loved ones and socializing/having a good time. Not by being the center of  attention.", "That\u2019s how you know a lot of the people commenting are either friendless or part of weird friend groups that settled due to loneliness. No one would ever choose to hang out with someone so high strung and controlling. I also don\u2019t think they have close families. Everyone saying that Avery should just tell aunt Gladys not to ask her things as this is OPs day sounds like one of those people you meet at the office who have no personality and only know their families. That\u2019s just not desirable in a friend- it\u2019s like a lead balloon. But I guess if you\u2019re a horrid bore like OP/her fans in comments you won\u2019t mind ruining a party because your parties are likely awful events held for antisocial people who don\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re too controlling and boring and malignant to have friends. No one who is interesting could possibly accept a three hour long event with one topic of conversation. No one.", "Quite frankly, I think it's telling that OP wasn't equally interested and involving herself in the conversation. That's some massively jealous vibes right there. I can guarantee if I was holding an engagement party for myself and my brother came in who hadn't been around for 10 years I'd be talking to him myself for half the time about what he'd been up to.", "I have a feeling the OP\u2019s family doesn\u2019t really like her or find her boring.", "I don\u2019t know. Once my grandma and great aunts zero in on a topic of conversation, they are not letting go! There is no such thing as redirecting them, and there is no way you\u2019re walking away from them until they\u2019re satisfied.", "I agree with a lot of this. There is one element I think needs to he considered: the family dynamic. There are all the other family members who played a role in this too. They all knew that day was important to OP, but they still sat around Avery to talk about those travels. I sense a bit of emotional neglect that took place towards OP in her childhood. Looks like Avery was the golden child that also didn't have the choice about the spotlight being put on her. I don't think OP is the AH for asking what she asked and reacting that way. I think the family is to blame for once again minimizing the impact of the preferential treatment on OP. \nImagine living a life where your own identity is solely dependent on how you do compared to someone who was given all the advantages. All the \"adults\" in this situation are really the AH for ignoring OP on her special day and putting their focus on Avery. They could have simply invited Avery over another day to chat. If it was important for Avery to spend time with them, she would make the time. The family then went on to blame OP for feeling hurt that the family did not make that special day about her.", "Real life doesn't work like this. You want talk about the event at hand for 100% of the time. Not even 50%. At weddings most people talk about whatever and mention the groom or the bride only sporadicaly. Being \"the life of the party\" just comes naturalny to some people and OP seems jealous of that thinking her sister does that on purpose.", "That's just nonsense. OP deserves all sympathy because she isn't actually angry with her sister. She is angry with herself because she feels she is uninteresting. I feel so sad for her because she is probably every bit as interesting as her sister. This is a self-esteem issue and to pretend it is about anyone else is unhelpful. Indeed cruel. No one has ever felt better about themselves by resenting someone else.", "What a nightmare of a party if people could only talk about the couple and the engagement.", "Engagement parties are exactly where people reconnect with family they haven\u2019t seen in a while. I\u2019m completely baffled by the people saying to focus the conversation on the couple. That\u2019s not how parties work. I\u2019ve never been to or heard of any party or wedding where anyone expected the majority the conversation of the guests to be focused on the couple.", "And like, honest is OP not interested in her sister's travels too? I mean, if it was my engagement party I'd have been in that group catching up with my sister and joking around with everyone. Like fuck man, if you want some attention, join in instead of moping that everyone is interested in your interesting sister.", "Yeah it the choice is hearing what colour flowers the bride wants at the church or that time a saved a village from a viral outbreak....I know which group I'm standing in ear shot of.", "Yeah like OP blames her sister for stealing the spotlight at an event she didn't even attend. Come on.", "What? Magically know??\n\nWho the hell do you think engagement parties are about??? \n\n\nAnd it's not 'no one is allowed to talk to my sister'\nIt's 'hey sis can you please turn down the spotlight one time at my literal engagement party to celebrate me specifically getting engaged'\n\nShe agreed to do that. Then she didn't do it. \n\n(Also an audience isn't mingling)", "Sounds like they were mingling to me. Sounds like OP didn't like it cause she doesn't like her sister.", "Oh buddy, you need to grow up.  The party was NOT for everyone, there was a purpose, Avery and the OPs family violated that purpose by not only ignoring the bride, but also the groom's family.", "I'm sorry, but have you ever actually been involved in a wedding? I used to work them, and let me tell you, the couple doesn't get to actually see much of anyone. There is simply too much happening. Avery can take up all the attention she likes then, because the wedding is, as you say, for everyone. \n\nThe engagement party, on the other hand, is supposed to be a celebration of two people. It's also when the couple actually gets to spend time with people and have it be about them in a less formal and hectic setting. It's pretty much the only time for this sort of attention unless she does a bridal shower. Though, this could easily happen there as well. \n\nIf you strip away the extra bullshit here, the dynamic is this;  OP asks her sister to handle herself and the conversation in a way that will keep this from being like a previous, very upsetting event (Graduation). This is in no way difficult to do and is an entirely reasonable request to make at a party thrown by OP specifically to celebrate this wonderful thing in her life. Her sister pretends to agree to it and then callously ignores her wishes.\n\nThe thing that you don't seem able to factor in here is that this is not at all accidental. I'm pretty good with people. I've been the center of attention like this a couple of times. It is in no way unintentional. To command the attention of several people in this setting requires careful observation and modulation throughout. It is not done passively. And with those same skills, it would not be difficult to break up the group and divert the attention back to the sister that you're supposed to ask be there for. Hell, someone without those skills could easily see a crowd gathering and make an excuse. Dip out of there to the bathroom and then come back and only talk to smaller groups of people. It doesn't take a genius. \n\nAvery either completely forgot her sister's recent request or chose to ignore it.", "There\u2019s people who throw parties because they want everybody to have a good time and people who throw parties because they want attention. OP is latter.", "Sisters been back for a week and OP mentions a few details of the foreign trips so she has likely just heard all about it already.", "They might like her well enough but her sister is just legitimately interesting. I have never been to Uganda or Yemen and I\u2019d love to hear about what it\u2019s like from a loved one who visited.", "Especially after the \u201cshe hogged all the attention at my graduation (side note she wasn\u2019t actually there)\u201d bit. Like OP has some stuff to work out imo", ">I just don't trust this account of events from OP.  The jealousy is leaking in every sentence\n\nTotally. My first thoughts reading this were basically like grow up. You sound like a jealous child.

She knew it was a point of contention, but didn\u2019t care.", "Lol, perfect", ">fawning\n\nI'm sorry but I have a hard time believing the jealous sister that the whole party was fawning over her sister. It sounds like OP is weirdly in her own head about her weird jealousy.", "No. Sorry. I have been to many, many engagement parties and nobody was making it all about them. Because normal adults that aren't narcissist's don't do that.\n\nAlso, I've been to a million weddings and maybe back in day, but now a days I've spent loads of time with the brides and grooms and they've definitely had enough time to spend with the people they want to. I feel like people have realized that they want to actually enjoy their weddings now.", "No, it's to celebrate with them. What is with the narcissism in this thread. Parties are to celebrate, not to show off. You don't dictate who people talk to at parties, you invite people over that you want to celebrate with them and enjoy their company. That's it.", "It's been 1 week. I doubt she's heard everything. We've all listened to a story more than once. She's being a baby. And OP mentioned the trip after this party, so yeah. I'm sure she has head some of it.", "Yta. You are extremely jealous of your sister and it shows. Also, no one in their right mind is going to spend the entire duration of the party talking about and fawning over you. That\u2019s unrealistic and ridiculous to even imagine. People can talk about what they want to talk about during parties, and if they happen to find your sister interesting, you should be happy. At least these people aren\u2019t sitting around deathly bored at your party. Well, now in your jealousy, you have let everyone see the true you. So not only in the future will your family find your sister more fascinating, but they will also see her as a victim compared to jealous, petty you. Congrats. Job well done.", "YTA people went to her what would you want her to say OP says for not to talk to you go be with her. You're jealous and very bitter.", "This is so interesting. While I can see the jealousy from OP (and sympathize), I can also sympathize with the older sister as her favoritism is not something that is her fault. I\u2019m not sure if no one is the AH or everyone is the AH or just OP or just the family but I personally don\u2019t think the sister of OP is. \n\nI\u2019m in a similar situation, except I\u2019m the older sister and I hate being the center of attention. More like I hate people staring and prying. Sure, I like knowing people like me, but I really don\u2019t like things being all about me. It\u2019s weird. I also truly feel sorry for my sibling who has grown up with a chip on his shoulder because there was clearly favoritism. It\u2019s really sad but at the end of the day, I have zero control how my family treats us. In fact, I\u2019ve begged them to not treat us differently, I\u2019ve taken myself out of the picture for months at a time. Nothing works. So I can honestly say, it has less to do with the sister as it does the family who is so enthralled by her. I can even go a step further and say I didn\u2019t wind up like OP\u2019s sister, being a physician, traveling the world. I\u2019m really not that interesting and our family still adores me and they treat him like an afterthought. Just mediocre, uninteresting. Neither of us have done anything to deserve this. In fact he\u2019s worked really hard to get more attention to no avail and I\u2019ve literally left the state to get away. It doesn\u2019t change!! And I\u2019d give anything to be close to my brother but he\u2019s so bitter, I think he sees my existence as a threat to his happiness. It\u2019s always been this way. I\u2019ve always wanted to be close. He couldn\u2019t get away from the family fast enough (but at the same time sought attention). Even when I talk to him, it\u2019s about our relationship in relation to the family. He doesn\u2019t see me as a separate entity from them. And honestly, I think when he sees me, he feels pain. Makes me so sad for his suffering. I\u2019ve actually been scanning Reddit for situations like this to see if going NC is the best solution. It\u2019s so complicated because he seems to want me around but at the same time, he pushes me away. He gets so guarded when around me. He thinks everything is a criticism or slight particularly from my parents. He gets so offended so easily. And he can be downright cruel to me. Op, I think you should decide what is most important to you. What will bring you happiness? If you can\u2019t get beyond the favoritism and it really impacts your mental health, maybe it\u2019s best to distance yourself from your sister and family. But on the other hand, if you still want your family around, maybe you need to figure out how to cope with this family dynamic. Another thing I\u2019ve considered was suggesting family therapy but just my brother and I. I really want it to work but I\u2019m not even sure if he wants to be that close. I wish you the best. Will definitely be following to see how things play out.", "This another one of those situations that can\u2019t be judged from somebody on the internet.

If multiple people at this gathering are saying OP was out of line, I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re right.", "This sounds absurd to me lol like she\u2019s just gunna say \u201cwe can talk about this another time\u201d and then go sit by herself at a table not talking to anyone?\n\nLike if I asked a cousin about a trip and they said this and then just went and sat down quietly, I\u2019d be concerned about them lol it\u2019s such an odd, unnatural interaction to have", "OP sounds insanely jealous and insecure and you obviously can\u2018t take her words at face value (\u201eshe had the whole family around her\u201c)", "are redditors like this in real life? lmaooo", "Absolutely. \n\nWard nurses generally have fairly good social skills because they spend the most time engaging with the patients' everyday care and reassuring family members, so they need a fair level of awareness, tact and diplomacy.\n\nPhysicians not so much. Surgeons even less!", "Oh, OP is definitely the jealous type. As a younger sister to a beautiful older sister, I've never acted this fucking ridiculous. I've never forced her to hide into a corner so I could stand out more. I've always been proud of her and proud she's my sister. Also, all through school teachers would say remarks that they wish I acted more like my sister, but I never thought it was my sister's fault.", "Yay really. If my sister was home for the first time in a decade, I'd glue myself to her to make up for lost time. Any attention she got would automatically fall on me too, out of shear proximity, if nothing else.", "Dude. Someone intentionally getting engaged at a wedding is not the same as family members finding sister\u2019s story more interesting and sister simply not refusing to talk about it. \n\nIf we are going to make wild assumptions- whose to say OP made any effort to greet/ make conversation with her own guests? Is she\u2019s just sitting in the corner waiting for everyone to come by and fawn?", "Did you really just conflate the sister existing and people wanting to talk to her with her purposely ruining a wedding?", "Right? It's congrats, now let's catch up and hangout", "I wouldn't attend an event in which the only thing I am allowed to talk about is the hosts of the event. How much of a main character do you have to be, to only want people to talk about you and nothing and no one else.", "I mean like really what even is there to say? Yep. They\u2019re getting engaged. They seem a great fit. Yeah the story is cute. Love a spring wedding.\n\nThen what? Do Avery and the other guest just\u2026stand there in silence? People keep saying \u201cjust deflect to op and Ben\u201d ok, like *what* ? Which topic? An engagement is just not a rich well to discuss especially when it\u2019s between two people that aren\u2019t even the engaged couple themselves. What exactly is Avery meant to redirect to? And how long is that supposed to go on?", "I just don\u2019t know exactly what these people think Avery is gonna redirect the hypothetical convo about Ben and op to. You can\u2019t get much out of an engagement OTHER people are having. People keep saying Avery should have talked about the wedding but this is an engagement party. They\u2019re barely in the wedding planning stages. Op has a nebulous idea about it. So what else is there? To talk about like\u2026the ring? Ok that gets us a few minutes. Bens job? How they met? Like guys think this through, Ben and op and their engagement are not a rich tapestry to converse about for hours with no other focus. In real life, that would be insanely dull and fucking **odd** to try and keep going. People can\u2019t answer what the fuck exactly should redirect to after her weird \u201cnope we can catch up later it\u2019s about Ben and op!\u201d Comment she should say because they have no idea either", "Avery probably is terrified to open her mouth around family in case it sets off her insecure sister.", "Doesn't even sound like it was that bad based on OP's biased account.", "Who small talks with family you're close to?", "You can tell in this comment section that there are a lot of Redditors who don't know how socialising works lol"]}
