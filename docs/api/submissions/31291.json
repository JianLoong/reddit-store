You're sitting there, snacking on raspberries, and your husband decides to use your lip balm on his feet. Okay, it's a bit unconventional, but is it really worth getting all worked up about? And then, when he goes for the raspberries, you decide to play the hygiene police and make a big fuss because he didn't wash his hands. Seriously?\r  \n\r  \nI mean, it's not like he was digging his whole hand into the bowl, right? He was just grabbing one raspberry at a time. But no, you have to go all dramatic and declare them \"foot raspberries\" like it's some crime against humanity.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then, to add insult to injury, you give him the silent treatment and refuse to use your precious lip balm on your lips because it touched his feet. Wow, talk about an overreaction. It's just raspberries and lip balm, not a crime scene.\r  \n\r  \nSo, yeah, you might be the asshole in this scenario. Maybe take a step back and consider if your reaction matches the situation. Foot raspberries or not, it's not the end of the world.\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, maybe ease up on the drama and let the man enjoy his snack without making it a major hygiene crisis.\n\nActually, yeah.
