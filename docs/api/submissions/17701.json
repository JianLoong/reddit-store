If someone comes around and sees a car in the visitor parking places without a valid pass then they will 9 times out of 10 call for a tow.", "Yeah but towing fines are a private company, so I feel like that\u2019s different than from the city. I\u2019m not proving my income to Joe\u2019s towing so that he can charge me more.", "Switzerland does this, and I belive Sweden in some instances.", "100% this. Fines are just rules for poor people.", "Shoulda slashed the tires first, that's how you hit those shitheads in the wallet.", "Well, I know you don't live in the state...guns aren't banned in California. I live in the bay area and there's gun clubs, indoor ranges and gun shops.", "It would have been easy enough to snap a photo of the other car with plate and parking pass. Leave your number and a note about your spot being taken. Mention that you have proof, and please contact before towing.\n\nIt would be a bit of a hassle, but much less so than waiting for a tow truck so you can move your car at 3 in the morning."]}
