I am NOT saying I\u2019ve never broken rules and it sounds like an overall shitty situation. However, the driver was in the wrong.", "All things considered I am going to say NTA because it doesn\u2019t sound like you were able to inform the driver first and you didn\u2019t have an alternative option for parking.", "NTA - but report this interaction to the office just to CYA. Don't let their story be the only one the office hears.", "NTA. My buddy lived in a place like yours. Everyone was informed where to park. On a regular basis, visitors complained when their cars were towed. Management had the same answer every time. Park in your designated area or be towed. I guess she has a nice fine to pay for her car. Oh well. Hope you can do her this favor again.", "NTA\n\nWhat were you supposed to do? Go on a pilgrimage to find this person amongst the hundreds of units in your complex? \n\nDon't wanna get towed? Then don't park somewhere that's illegal to park. You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA\n\n#Illegal parkers deserve **_ZERO_** tolerance. \n\nHonestly, fines to get cars back are *too low*. Make that shit *hurt*.", "NTA How could you have possibly informed her when you didn't know who or where she was?", "NTA\n\nThey weren't supposed to be there. I'd tell them good luck and be done with it. And every time I see them park where they shouldn't, call the tow company.", "NTA, she broke the rules she has to deal with the consequences, that\u2019ll never hold up in court either\u2026 I had an issue with my neighbors lazy ass kids parking in my spot too instead of guest parking, I didn\u2019t have them towed but I parked so close to their bumper they couldn\u2019t leave and pretended to be asleep when they knocked on the door lol \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.\n\nShe parked in the wrong spot, leaving you with no place to park. Since she has a permit, she presumably did this on purpose. (My guess is that she had a guest that was using her spot.)\n\nIt would have been generous for you to have asked her to move, rather than calling a tow truck, but given the time of night, the difficulty in finding her apartment, and the fact that took your spot, you were perfectly within your rights to just call a tow truck.\n\nAlso, you do _not_ owe the towing fee. If she harasses you about this, let the management know.\n\nIt stinks to have your car towed but it's also very inconsiderate to take someone else's spot.", "NTA\n\nNobody should have to hunt for a parking space at 2am because some idiot took their space. \n\nTFB, and don\u2019t lose any sleep over it.", "NTA at all! It's your spot, and you have a right to use it.", "NTA!\n\nAs you detailed, you had no way of knowing whose car it was, much less how to get ahold of them.\n\nThen she blames you for the consequences of her behavior, that she absolutely knew was wrong, with the added bonus of stalking you in the parking lot. Yuck.", "NTA HOW? How could you of known whereabouts of this looser? She\u2019s not gonna do sh*t with your plate #. You should of took a picture of her taking the picture. Just to further infuriate her. She\u2019s wrong and The asshole.", "NTA. Even if you weren\u2019t tired and it wasn\u2019t the middle of the night. She knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to park there", "Lol NTA.  I tow people who block my driveway in New Orleans literally once a month.  Every single one that comes to confront me is an Airbnb guest who also demands i pay their towing fee.  I tell them to piss off and hope they had a great trip in the big easy.", "NTA\n\nShe made her bed, just didn't want to lay in it.", "And how were you supposed to do that? Use your psychic powers to come up with her phone number? \n\nNTA.", "NTA-if she talks to you again, film her and tell her that you will report her for harassment.", "NTA. She knew there was a visitor lot and knew she was parking in someone's spot. Her obligation is to park where she's allowed to.\n\nYour right is to park in your spot 24/7. Her obligation is to pat the tow fee for her car.\n\nI hope you have a camera on your car or took a photo of her license plate. If not and there are cameras at the gates or near your parking spot please contact management and ask them to look for the license plate of the car you had towed, day and time.\n\nWhile she may have taken the photo thinking it was some kind of flex, I'd be concerned because she may plan to vandalize your car if she sees it anywhere else", "NTA. You could\u2019ve been nice to go out your way and find then ask the person to move their car but you are not obligated to. If I was tired and the apartment was like a literal maze, I also would\u2019ve called in the tow truck.", "ESH. You could have parked in the visitors lot and left a note and fixed things in the morning. \nTowing and impound is massively expensive so unless that person can afford it that\u2019s a big deal. \n\nDid you have the right to call the tow company? Yes\n\nWas there a more considerate option? Definitely \n\nLegally in the clear. Morally I think you enjoyed it since waiting for the tow and then parking obviously took more time than the alternative you had available", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
