We used to live in a townhouse that would tow if you were parked in the unassigned spots after 9 PM without a permit. For single guests, we had a permit. For multiple guests, I'd send out a map with safe areas marked so people could park and not get towed.\n\nEven with all that, a friend got towed once \u2014 when the HOA changed the time from 12 PM to 9 PM.

We have a resident permit from the city to park in the neighborhood zone, and I warned him about the street sweeping where once a month you're not allowed to park on one side of the street. Apparently one of the streets here isn't covered by the permit parking and has a 72 hour limit, but I double checked the location when I got back and there are no signs forbidding anything except for the street sweeping. I have parked there many times, the only reason it wouldn't have happened to me is that I use my car frequently enough it wouldn't be parked for 3 days at a time.
