If not and there are cameras at the gates or near your parking spot please contact management and ask them to look for the license plate of the car you had towed, day and time.\n\nWhile she may have taken the photo thinking it was some kind of flex, I'd be concerned because she may plan to vandalize your car if she sees it anywhere else", "NTA.

You could have parked in the visitors lot and left a note and fixed things in the morning. \nTowing and impound is massively expensive so unless that person can afford it that\u2019s a big deal. \n\nDid you have the right to call the tow company? Yes\n\nWas there a more considerate option? Definitely \n\nLegally in the clear.

My next door neighbor used my car to run an errand for me because I was crying too hard. He parked it one spot away from my spot. Heres the kicker. I'd lived there six months.  Every other car under our carport was a silver sedan. I had an electric blue RAV4 with a  bike rack. It was obvious that my car was her neighbor, merely misparked, and my spot right next was empty and available. \n\nCost me $500 and even worse the knowledge I lived so close to a total AH. I will hate her forever. Yes, having your neighbors car towed makes YTA.", "NTA.  She knew she wasn't supposed to park there.  Her ridiculous entitlement.  She is full of shit.  \n\nI'd have done the exact same thing but the management here lives in fear of the entitled asshats who do this sort of thing.

It's her responsibility to park according to the rules or face the consequences. It's not your responsibility to fix someone else's mistake, the exception being life or limb imo.
