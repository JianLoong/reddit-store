I totally understand how you feel..\n\nMy bully was a nightmare to deal with. It started when I was in 5th grade, if you can believe that.  She was in 7th grade and was a total B.t..ch. She was one of those people that couldn't and wouldn't understand when you said leave me alone. She would push you, trip you, pull hair, spit at you, grab your stuff and run,\nBasically, anything that was annoying, she did it.  I was so happy when she went to eighth grade because she had to go to another school... We lived in the same neighborhood, so as usual, most kids had to go to the schools that were assigned to the neighborhood.  By the time I was in junior high, same annoying B....same immature annoying sh.t...\n\nBy high school, things changed. In my first year 9th grade, she moved to another state. When I got in 10th grade, I started hearing people asking if I had seen this person. I couldn't believe it that troll was back. Apparently, the family had moved back in town.. \nOh, but my mindset was so different. I was determined I wasn't letting this person get to me.. \n\nThen something happened when people at school started telling me that she had always wanted to fight me. That's what all the bullying was about... \n\nGood, I was total game. I sent word through everyone who knew the both of us  that I was good to go...\n\nIt was my total pleasure to indulge her wish. I was looking forward to it!\n\nShe, of course, became a huge coward. I wasn't that small, timid 5th grader she took pleasure in bullying anymore.  I tried my very best to provoke something she would barely look at me. She actually sent messages through all mutual acquaintances that she didn't want to fight me any longer..

Hats off to you for not monkey stomping him on the spot.", "I agree NTA!  \n\nBut let's take this to the most honest and hopefully helpful place! \n\nYou were polite and said no thank you. When mutual friends told you that he had been in a bad place then, your honest response should have been, that you could understand that, but it does not excuse the harm he did to you. And that the only way to respect his personal growth is if he takes responsibility for the harm he did while he was under the influence of his horrible home life.\n\nMost forms of recovery therapy, rather we are recovering from alcoholism, drugs, horrible childhoods, etc, have a point in which we expect our patients to start taking responsibility for the harm that their actions caused to others. No they cannot undo the damage they have done. However, they can should and must acknowledge the harm they have done to others and apologize at the very least.\n\nNow, maybe your former bully might have followed up the handshake with an apology. There is no way to know, but the people who we have wronged well we have been under the influence always have the right to refuse to interact with or accept our apologies. This is part of what is taught to those who are going through alcoholics anonymous, opiate recoveries, or healing from the schemas we developed while going through horrible home lives. Schemas for those who don't know is the habits we develop to help us survive while we are going through horrible time, that turn out to be very detrimental to us when we are no longer in that horrible situation.", "Sort of the asshole.

But you don't have to pretend to think it's pleasant to suddenly meet someone who caused you so much hurt and pain, shake his hands like this guy didn't make your life miserable. \n\nHe didn't even apologize or express regret about how he treated you, so why should you be extending an olive branch? Though to be fair, he wasn't expecting to see you too, and was probably shocked. \n\nMaybe explain that to them, but I don't blame you if you don't want to bother.", "NTA.  I was kind of a jerk in school.  Things weren't going well at home and I failed math tests/classes on a regular basis.  When kids made fun of me, I got into fights.  I figured if I was going to be miserable, I'd make them miserable, too.  As an adult, when I see a kid from back then, the first thing I say is, \"I'm sorry I was a jerk back then.  You deserved better.\"  I've never had anyone not accept my apology.  \n\nYour bully didn't offer an apology.  He just blew off the past.  I wouldn't have shaken his hand, either.  I applaud your actions and I'm sorry he isn't smart enough to realize he needs to try to make amends.", "NTA. He may have been in it a bad place. But though it may explain, it doesn't excuse him putting you in a bad place. Unfair for people who weren't on the recieving end to decide you need to be social (you were polite in declining and withdrawing).\n\nEdit for word choice.", "NTA. Get new friends.", "NTA - Boohoo for him he had a bad home life, so that gives him carte Blanche to be an AH and bully kids with no repercussions? People giving bull excuses to cover for people annoys me no end, the least the guy could have done is say listen I know I was a massive AH in school, I was a kid and I didn\u2019t understand but as an adult know I understand and regret what I did to you, I\u2019m not asking for forgiveness just wanted to get this across to you.  \n\nIf he truly meant something like that then maybe, JUST MAYBE he could earn some respect.", "NTA\n\nyou have every right to care for yourself.  you are not being childish - it sounds like you might be experiencing some pain from that whole experience still.  \n\nI do think there is a possibility of looking at this as a process rather than an event.  If you took \\*you\\* out of the equation.... and you found out this other guy had been abused...would you feel compassion?  It is a HUGE leap - to be able to feel compassion towards an abuser, but, maybe that guy would want to apologize to you if he knew what he did to you.\n\nRegardless - if you need to walk away for your own mental health, then you walk away.  If you are not ready to talk to your bully - then do not do it.  It does not matter what your friends thing - you take care of YOU.", "NTA", "NTA. Sure, he could be a better person now and he could regret what he did.\nBut he still did it and you had to live through it.\nYou aren\u2019t obligated to forgive him.", "NTA\n\nYour friends are being jerks. You reacted the way you should have. Don\u2019t give a free pass to a bulky for someone else\u2019s comfort.\n\nIt sucks that he bullied you. It sucks that he tried to pretend like it didn\u2019t happen. It sucks that your friends minimized the pain you felt.\n\nYou sound like a solid dude with some crappy friends. You deserve better friends.", "Nta", "Agreed. Fuck tht noise OP. You dont owe him anything and get better friends. Birds of a feather and all the dude that dm'd u is an AH they both sound horrible.", "Wouldn\u2019t that be so CONVENIENT for them right?", "I accidentally discovered that my bully in grade school and part of middle school (who had a bad home life apparently and who my parents made me be friends with, despite me telling them about the things she said and did to me) worked at a coffee shop in my home town. Discovered it when I got to the window and she was there. Thankfully, she had the decency to pretend not to know me and had something she \u201chad to do\u201d in the back and after that I never saw her again.\n\nCan\u2019t imagine what I would\u2019ve done if she\u2019d acted like OP\u2019s bully.", "Having a bad home life isn\u2019t an explanation, it\u2019s an excuse.", "They did. They set a boundary just like a grown up should", "He did act like a grown up. He refused to make nice with someone who used to abuse him. He didn't make a scene. It doesn't matter if it was 10 years ago. The abuse happened. I said this in another comment: You don't have to befriend your abuser or spend time with them as in a group of friends & pretend nothing ever happened, even if you forgive them. OP didn't feel comfortable so he did the adult thing & removed himself from the situation. (BTW, this is not a 'kids are mean' thing - it was bad enough that OP changed schools.)", "Found a ~~former~~ bully.", "So true. Enablers are effectively gaslighting the victim into thinking what happened to them was okay, normal, or at least no big deal. They make the victim question the validity of their pain and suffering.", "NTA I was also bullied in Jr Hi by 2 people at the same time. It led to years and years of self abuse - an eating disorder, alcohol abuse, etc. I am 60 years old and still remember every painful detail. I hope you have realized that you are worthy of loving yourself. Tell yourself every day that you love yourself and that\u2019s all that matters. Good luck on your continuing journey to healing. You are worth it.", "OP didn't run away from facing something difficult; he was surprised & had no idea he'd run into the bully. He doesn't need to confront him about anything. What was done, was done & can't be undone.\n\nWhether the OP gets an apology or not, he went through a lot of trauma because of bully-boy. An apology doesn't erase that. So the bully might be sorry. So what? Saying sorry might make the bully feel better, but it doesn't change anything for OP. Those emotional scars don't just disappear. That's something OP must work on if he wants, but even so, even if he ends up forgiving the bully, it doesn't mean he has to forget what happened and it doesn't mean he has to spend an evening with him in a group of friends. You don't have to befriend your abuser & it's okay to walk away.", "When did having boundaries mean not having manner or common decency?", "It's immature and behavior like this is why the world is so full of hate and disregard for people. Every single person in this reddit thread has done something fucked up to another person. Does that make all of them bad or does it just make them fallable.", "Your experience is that you befriended your bullies but still hate them for bullying you. Not sure you want to be giving out advice.", "No. Every person has not done something fucked up to another person. So don\u2019t speak for everyone. Were you a school bully? Is this why you\u2019re pushing so hard against OP? \n\nBullying is no fucking joke mentally. So many people have committed suicide because of bullying and the emotional/physical torture. A quick sorry or making excuses doesn\u2019t fix it for a lot of folks.", "I did not befriend them? The fuck? They *were* my friends. Then they decided to bully me. If i never see them again i\u2018ll be happy. But i am not going to make a situation super awkward because i have to air my dirty laundry in front of everyone else", "This just shows your complete lack of self awareness. No I was not a bully, yes I was bullied. Too many people in this thread have the self delusion that they are perfect. You still see the world as black and white and still can't step back to look at the larger picture", "Lack of self awareness by asking if you were bully because you were defending the bully?", "NTA. the whole \u201cforgive and forget\u201d movement is nothing but a bunch of enabling bullshit.", "Not an asshole.\n\nThis guy made you feel horrible about yourself and it is understandable that you would not want to do anything with him.\n\nBut just so to say, people change. Maybe he may have been able to see the wrongs he did to you and wanted to make amends.", "NTA, I have done this same thing and got the same response from my \u201cfriends.\u201d At the time it was unpleasant, but after thinking about it for a while, I realized I could go on without them and I never looked back.", "good for you. fuck that guy", "NTA, but do make sure that to \"apologise\" to the friend who texted you for making the environment \"awkward\", and let him know you wouldn't be attending any get togethers if your bully would be present. So, you know, you wouldn't be making things awkward then.\n\nOr better yet, rethink if you really want this friendship", "The excuses for the bully do nothing for the trauma you have suffered, just fuck that bullshit, you are absolutely NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. People who think you should stop acting \u201cchildish\u201d about your trauma only want you to get over it so that they don\u2019t have to reconcile with the fact that their friend used to be an emotional terrorist to his classmates.", ">They responded with an excuse on his behalf about how he had a bad home life and was just acting out, and I didn\u2019t bother responding because I think that\u2019s completely dodging the blame that he deserves. So, AITA?\n\nNo, NTA, because you're correct it is a cheap dodge of blame. Loads of people have bad home lives and they don't hurt people, kill people, abuse animals, or whatever else. Having a bad home life might be the explanation, but it isn't a justification.\n\nThe fact that he either doesn't remember or clearly wished not address his past deeds implies he's still that little asshole with the bad home and hasn't matured enough to offer a basic apology.", "Nta", "NTA", "He can feel however bad, but that doesn't mean you have to forgive his cruelty.

NTA", "The axe forgets but the tree remembers.", "This. I wish I could give it more than 1 uptick.", "I was bullied, and allowing someone to have that much power over me after do many years seems counter intuitive to my own growth and mental health.

Back in highschool..... Get over it people!!!", "NTA.", "NTA. Even though he could have changed and may actually have become a nice guy, they all should understand that you were his victim. No way are you obligated to make nice with him.", "I discovered my school bully died in an accident. I\u2019m not sure how to feel about that. From what I read he had turned his life around.

Ditch that group.", "NTA", "NTA\nAlmost exact same situation happened to me except instead of a hand shake he just tried to take over the conversation and was trying to get all of the attention.   \n\nHe asked me why I was being rude to him and I (F) said \"because Tony... you have only cared about 1 person after all these years and that is..
