If he genuinely had a reason for acting out then, and realised what he did was wrong, or had any remorse for it as an adult, he would've apologised to you directly. \n\nIf it made it awkward for the rest of the group, that's their problem, and they should realise this guy caused you a lot of mental and emotional turmoil. Being abuser-sympathisers is not a good look for them...", "NTA. Too many people look at the past through rose coloured glasses. He may have forgotten or decided it was a minor thing but for you it's a very real memory and affected you going forward.", "NTA. He didn't address his bullying habit at the time, so guess what, you still carry that pain with you. The years between don't matter. If he'd offered his hand the day after a bullying spree, you wouldn't take it. So why should you now?\n\n'Let it go' only ever seems to benefit the bully, doesn't it? As though other people's discomfort matters more than what you went through. Fuck him and his shallow buddies (probably still in awe of him, the idiots).", "NTA.\n\nSorry, but having a bad home life is an explanation for his behavior, but it doesn't excuse the fact that he bullied you to the point that you had to change schools.  \n\nAlso, you are under no obligation to forgive him even if he made a sincere apology, which he didn't.  Nor were you required to shake his hand and pretend that the bullying never happened in order to insure they have a fun night out.  \n\nDon't respond to these people, and block them on social media for your own peace of mind.", "NTA. It's on that guy to talk to you about his shit life and apologize for what he put you through. You can decide whether to shake hands later. For now, he doesn't deserve your handshake.", "NTA he was a bully, you don\u2019t need to set your trauma aside to make him feel comfortable", "My home life was not great growing up.

Just using the excuse that it was okay because he had a tough time at home and was acting out so its okay he treated you like crap clears you of simply not shaking his hand.

No, you are NOT the AH.", "NTA - You don\u2019t have to do anything you do not want. And them making excuses for him is not ok.", "NTA. You\u2019re still working through stuff and if it\u2019s going to set your progress back, don\u2019t do it.

I can't believe anyone expected you to shake his hand and the fact the first thing out of his mouth wasn't a heartfelt apology means he hasn't changed a bit. Fuck that guy and his enablers.

You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nThe only relevance these people have to you is a brief shared history which includes the terrible bullying.", "NTA. Sure, people change, but nothing here indicates he's undertaken any personal growth.\n\nYou know what would be a good measure of growth? If he reached out to you (instead of your friends reaching out), stood up like a mature adult and owned his actions, and then offered a genuine apology. Even then you have no obligation to accept it, nor to have a friendship with him.\n\nI'd have done the same thing in your shoes.", "Yeah the whole entire \"the bully could have or does have a hard home life\" excuse giving them carte blanche to do whatever shitty thing they want to whoever they want because life harder for them is a bunch of rancid bullshit. Bullies who don't ask and work hard for forgiveness doesn't deserve it. Sure it happened ages ago but they never apologized thus they don't just automatically get forgiveness just because time has passed.\n\nSucked that his life at home was so much hell but that wasn't your fault and no he doesn't get a free ride to be an ass just because of it. Other kids are not there to be punching bags for the ones that have abusive parents and they should be harshly punished for seeing other kids as outlets for their frustrations not coddled...to hell with him and to hell with all of the people defending him. You don't owe him anything lest of all a handshake.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.. For if the bully was aware of who he was back then and remorseful, he'd have told the group that it's no big deal, he understands why you refused his handshake.

Throughout my grade school years I was heavily bullied, insulted, and at some points attacked.\n\nThen I got out of high school and realized none of that even mattered, and I'm a much different person than I was back in grade school.\n\nThe only thing I'd say against your post is I don't think it'd be unreasonable to give him a chance. \n\nRegardless, NTA: You're never forced to befriend or even communicate with someone you have no interest in befriending, and you didn't cause a scene.", "I am going to go against others and say YTA. Look i get it. I was bullied horribly by former friends and it made me have a mental breakdown and needing me to go in-patient. And a part of me hates them. But i would never ever, do what you did. Because you were talking to people who didn\u2019t bully you and who you wanted to catch up with. It served absolutely zero purpose for you to act like this.
