My girlfriend (38) and I (27) went to a Halloween party where we saw an old friend of mine that I used to work with that is in her 50s , we'll just call her Jen. Ironically, the last time I saw her was at the same time last year. Last year we discussed that my girlfriend, my friend and myself would get together for lunch, but life got in the way and it ended up not happening. \nAs we were all sitting Jen said that her , my girlfriend and myself never had that lunch. She then asked for permission from my girlfriend if she can take a picture with me, not sure if it was as a joke or what have you but that rubbed my GF the wrong way. A few minutes later my gf tells me that she is leaving so i walk her to the car. \nAs she gets in she says that she is going to another party with her ex boyfriend and that i need to go back to the party with my \"friends\". Instead of telling me what happened to make her feel this way she continued saying hurtful things.\n\nI got into the car with her and the argument ensues. \nShe calls my friend a b*tch and then says they she knows what she was trying to do. At this point I'm still lost. She continues to say that she only her Jen say our names and not my GFs name when she was talking about the lunch even though I clearly heard Jen said all our names. Then she goes on to say that being asked if it's ok to take a pic with me is an insult and that Jen asked 4 times even though I myself heard it once. My gf says that I'm not get property to ask for permission and she was doing it o on purpose.\n\nI was upset and was trying to explain my side of the story and what I heard and tell her that i didn't hear jen ask 4 times if it's ok to take a pic with me, that i heard Jen say the three of us about lunch, and that i believed she was asking out of respect. \n\nI told my gf that she is acting like a kid having a temper tantrum. I told her that if she had an issue she should have just pulled me aside and expressed what she felt instead of acting this way. \n\nShe then goes on to say that i didn't defend her or stand up for her when Jen asked for permission. Then comparing me to her ex saying that he would have not taken the photo and he would've stood up for her. I told her i did not notice that it was an insult and if it made her feel comfortable that i would go and ask Jen what the whole thing was about. She says it's too late and drives away.\nAITA??", "created_utc": 1667152405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhl0qj/aita_for_not_defending_my_girlfriend_over_an_old/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Going to party with the ex boyfriend? Emotional blackmail. Also suspicious in itself.", "NTA. I'm not sure how long you've been with your gf, but anyone whose first move when they feel slighted is to go hang out with an ex is not invested in a relationship with you.", "I don't think ur TA...I think ur gf was a bit jealous that another women was giving you a bit of attention...even if it was just by asking for a picture~your friend asking her permission most likely thought that was the best way to go~maybe she sensed some vibes she was giving off & thought it would be respectful...your gf was jealous & then wanted to make you jealous by leaving to go to a party where her ex would be...\nShe is 38 years old...you're 27~yet she seems very immature \ud83d\ude44", "NTA your gf is 38 acting like she's 5 years old abd it's exhausting.  It sounded like she was jealous of a 50 year old.  Good grief she has problems.  Ditch her move on.", "NTA. Your gf is 38? She sure doesn't act like it.", "NTA but your girlfriend is batshit crazy!!! Jen was very respectful to her and THAT set her off?!?! Girlfriend was looking for a reason to holla at her ex and she made one up", "NTA. Why would you defend someone acting psycho? Your gf is toxic as fuck and you need to get smart and dump her.", "Buahahahaha NTA \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nYour gf gets so angry over polite conversation and then threatens you with going to a party with her ex?! Hahaha dude be grateful you saw the crazy early. I didn\u2019t see anything in your explanation that warranted you backing gf up or defending her. I have to be missing something\u2026 \n\nAnd I\u2019m not joking this literally made me lol", "Um NTA. She\u2019s 40 acting like a scorn teenager at homecoming. Not worth staying with someone this stunted and immature.", "NTA. Your friend was being respectful in asking permission from your gf to take a photo with you. Although outdated, it's still a sign of respect. Really don't understand how your gf took it that way. She sounds really, really dramatic.", "This is a clear cut case of NTA.", "If your account is true on the saying her actual name and only asking about a pic once that's some gaslighting right there. Sounds to me like she planned on meeting up with her ex anyway and was just using this as an excuse to do it without you which is shady. I would seriously question the relationship she currently has with her ex.", "Wow, she sounds exhausting.
