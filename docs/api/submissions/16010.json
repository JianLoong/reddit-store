She always tried to frame me for stuff my cousins done, called me a mutt, and just always said how I look like a dike and so much more but that\u2019s another story. \n\nI ended up buying the property and it\u2019s a good 4 acres and all. I ended up having certain family visit (the ones that I trust) since I really don\u2019t like anyone in my business. Well my gram called asking if she go over and take a walk around to remember old times. I told her she is not allowed to step on my property especially since I don\u2019t trust her. She just hung up. So I left it as that. \n\nI decided to treat myself to my favorite restaurant and was having me a drink watching the basketball game. She came up and begged. I said I\u2019m sorry but I do not trust her and I do not feel comfortable with her around me and to please leave me alone. She said she just wanted to ask me a favor.

I told her I will not as it\u2019s my property and I do not want her anywhere near me especially as my neighbor. She said I\u2019ll regret it and left. I didn\u2019t take it to heart. \n\nLater that night I heard my dogs going off. I went to go look and ended up finding her damaging my fence, my rv connections, and including my friends rv who was stayin there at the time. I called the police and did press charges. Her claim is she did it because it isn\u2019t fair that I\u2019m doing well when my cousin is not. \nThing is I work and my cousin expects everything handed to her.
