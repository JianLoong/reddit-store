So.. you didn't hear a large portion of what was said anyway, and then instead of addressing it with the people who are supposed to be authorities, you chose to wait until you got home to tell your father, who then proceeded to go postal on the people you never addressed it with who were responsible for dealing with it with any level of immediacy. \n\n\n\n\nProbably not what you want to hear, but the world is not soft and friendly, and kushy, you have to realize that from what you've said about your history.  In a world like that you MUST address your own problems first.  If Jim is running his mouth, your first inclination needs to be to tell him to shut up.  If Jim doesn't shut up, then you go to the teacher and admin to have them shut Jim up, and/or expel Jim.  If they fail to do their job, THEN you bring your father into the situation to demand action.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not assertive the Jim's of the world will walk all over you every time, any time they like.  Aside from that, you got people's asses chewed without giving them the proper opportunity to address the issue.  You say the teacher was ignoring it, but was he/she or were they completely aloof of the situation because nobody said anything?  \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't like the soup in a restaurant, you say its bad and send it back.  Someone throwing around sexual innuendos related to you is a bit more than bad soup, why would you not say anything in your own defense, at least ask for the teacher to help, or have your friend do it for you?  For that matter, why would your friend not just automatically go to the teacher on your behalf?
