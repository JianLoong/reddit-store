In a world like that you MUST address your own problems first.  If Jim is running his mouth, your first inclination needs to be to tell him to shut up.  If Jim doesn't shut up, then you go to the teacher and admin to have them shut Jim up, and/or expel Jim.  If they fail to do their job, THEN you bring your father into the situation to demand action.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not assertive the Jim's of the world will walk all over you every time, any time they like.

Someone throwing around sexual innuendos related to you is a bit more than bad soup, why would you not say anything in your own defense, at least ask for the teacher to help, or have your friend do it for you?

There are SOME things we can do. Teacher, counselor, coach, nurse - it can be anyone. A lot of times when boys showed this behavior I was able to stop it (as the school counselor) simply by calling them out on it in excruciating detail. \n\nIt wont always help, and again your admin deserves to their job, but the school should know.", "NTA.

It's kind of hard for me to understand you but are you saying you were sexually harassed at school and your principal made you have a meeting with your harasser without talking to your parents?", "You are NTA. I would suggest having your father accompany you to any subsequent meetings with the headmaster.", "NTA. It sounds like the school is bending over backwards to protect *poor little jim* from the consequences of his own actions. Going to your dad was the correct thing to do. Without his intervention, I doubt a conversation concerning jim\u2019s behavior would have occurred at all.", "NTA tell your dad again and have your friend tell their parents and have the parents talk to the school board and the principals boss.

Jim is absolutely out of line, and if this happened anywhere in the professional world, especially with witnesses, he would likely lose his job over this bare minimum. This is harassment, and the school is effectively blaming you. Get a lawyer. Write everything down.", "NTA - 2 words, Scorched Earth.

Also gets the entire area to realize how much of a creep Jim is. This is very much sexual harassment, even if he didn't touch you.", "NTA.  Dad should have been invited to the meeting also, and the principal needs to be reprimanded, along with the teacher.", "You got gaslighted by Jim. Also this school doesnt want any scandals which is why they are throwing shit under the rug.

He ended up standing up for his daughter and that's what dads need to do.", "Going to your dad is never a bad idea. Especially if he is one that would go to jail for you, as you put it. \nSchools are notorious for hushing things down. Your dad getting in there prevents them from doing that. Don't let him skate.

What Jim did was loathsome.\nNTA.", "op=NTA\n\nClearly, the Principal wasn't going to do anything to support you--if he can't do it even when your Dad is there to back you up.  Imagine if you had gone to him alone--I feel Victim Blaming would have been the result.\n\nYour Dad needs to go up above Principal's head.  This sort of behavior(on Jim and Principal's part) is UNACCEPTABLE.\n\nAnd having an advocate with you in situations where you don't feel safe is SENSIBLE.", "Keep telling your father about the incidents at the school.

The school has a responsibility to take all complaints seriously and to ensure that their staff are intervening when they see these things happening. They failed to do that. You did the right thing in telling your dad what was happening. He did the right thing by contacting the staff. I'm glad you have his support in such a way. In my opinion, the school should be held accountable for their failure to act initially in addition to their handling of this situation as it evolved.", "You did nothing wrong NTA. I had a friend in high school who went to the guidance counselor after something happened. They shamed her. The principal ended up being told by my father. The principal took it seriously and got the authorities involved. He couldn\u2019t kick the kid that did it out of school though since it didn\u2019t happen at school. Point being most of the time someone\u2019s parent is going to have to get involved anyway. Schools are bad at these types of issues.", "No, no, no.  Do NOT feel guilty for seeking safety and support from an adult.  Jim is old enough to understand his behavior is unacceptable.  Your principal is gaslighting you. Your teacher and your principal are both trash and should NOT be in an environment with children.

Every adult at the school has failed you. Go Scorched Earth. Get your dad to talk to the superintendent, also contact the local news if you're comfortable. If it's happened to you, it's likely happened to a lot of other girls who aren't comfortable speaking up. Plaster Jim's face on the area as a creep and lambast the school on all your socials.

They failed. \n\nAnd yeah, I wonder why a 16 year old girl with a history of being sexually assaulted is more comfortable talking online via text rather than face to face with a man who has explicitly made sexual comments about what he would do to her. Big fucking mystery. \n\nThe teacher got a \"fair chance\" to deal with the issue. Nobody gives a fuck why you fail to do your job, just that you failed. That goes for any job, teacher or otherwise. Also - you contradicted yourself. You state it's not the teacher's job to intervene (it definitely is), but then state OP should have given the teacher a chance to help. But why, if you think it's not the teacher's job? If you think it's not the teacher's job then surely going to her father was the correct choice?", "Bro had a stroke he makes no sense", "NTA. \n\nYou clearly trust your dad to protect you, something the school has been shown to fail at. It was a good call to get your dad involved, as students trying by themselves seemed to be ignored (or punished, if the principal allowing Jim to yell at you says anything).\n\nIDK where you live, but Jim's behavior can be deemed verbal sexual harassment. Since the school is not dealing with it, they're encouraging harassment in their facilities.

What Jim is doing is illegal.", "The principal is failing you BIG TIME.  It\u2019s not up to him who you tell about being sexually harassed. On top of that, by blaming you, he has shifted the conversation away from the sexual harassment to shaming you for who you told. Keep relying on your dad, as he sounds awesome and has your back. You are NTA. Jim is, along with the principal. Note: retired principal here. Shame on those 2. Go dad!", "NTA\n\nThis is why programs like see something say something has started. You need to file a sexual harassment complaint with your district office. Have your father do it you are nervous about it. He should definitely do everything in his power to protect you from harm.

If the teacher could hear him (and it sounds like they could) then what would the point have been in going to them???\n\nIf it\u2019s still feasible, I\u2019d ask the principal to email you confirming that he knows Jim said xyz and intends to do nothing. Get it in writing. Then take that to the school board.\n\nSince I know what it\u2019s like being the victim of SA, have your dad request this if needed.

Continue to rely on your father, you've done nothing wrong.\nIt's lovely he's there for you.", "NTA\n\nThe notion that you can only tell one person that you are being sexually harrassed is absurd.\n\nThe principal is out of line - for criticizing you for going to your parent first, for letting Jim yell at you (and you NEVER should have been pulled in to the office with him to begin with) and for the school\u2019s obvious failure in taking earlier complaints seriously, which is also why telling your dad was the right thing to do.", "NTA, it would probably be worse if you hadn't.

You do not know if they heard him, you do not know if the teachers have gone to the administration and were told not a problem. This happens more than you think. Teachers see a problem, and they are told it is not a big deal. Plus who is Jim's family. That also comes in", "Agree with both points. The school can't stop you telling other people. If they try, they're trying to make things easy for themselves and ass-covering.\n\nAnd dads (or mums), don't make your kids afraid to confide in you by promising to go scorched earth.

He should let the Principal know that if the school doesn\u2019t take immediate action to ensure you are not harassed by Jim, that there will be a police report following.", "Your school (and the creep) want to sweep this under the rug. The time to act was when he was being vulgar in class. Your dad won't let them ignore this, so of course they want you to have gone to them.

The school handled it all wrong. Your parents should be taking this higher up. I know I would as a parent. If this happened to my child I would probably tear down the school brick by brick.", "Teacher and school opened themselves up for a lawsuit. Sexual harassment was reported and they essentially reprimanded the victim. Big whoopsie. Go straight to suing the school board for not only allowing it, but condoning and defending it.", "Don\u2019t just go over his head, take his fucking head off - if OP\u2019s dad gets a lawyer involved the Principal\u2019s head will be rolling over this, and probably take half the school board with him. \n\nOP won\u2019t need to work a day in her life once a halfway competent lawyer is done with the district.", "Honestly, that meeting was such a foolish idea. They already knew OP was willing and able to confide in her dad. It was a huge gamble to think she wouldn't go straight to her dad after that meeting. Yes, a teenager is easier to manipulate this way... But even though OP didn't go straight to her dad, she did go straight to the internet. She knew the whole thing was wrong, and people have so many more resources available to find out what to do when something bad happens. The school faculty gambled and lost thinking they could control OP and her friend to keep things to  themselves. Though, from the looks  of the boy's behavior, they've succeeded before.", "I was thinking the same thing. It's irresponsible of the school faculty to have such a meeting without any parents present. Obviously the goal was to manipulate OP and their friend into not pushing things further, but that meeting was a total liability.\n\nOP, PLEASE tell your dad about what happened. Go up the ladder of the school district. If no one takes you guys seriously, talking to a lawyer may be the next step. None of this was okay, and the people that are supposed to be protecting you are failing you (except your awesome dad).", "If the teacher didn't notice he is fine, if he did notice, reported it and got ignored he would still be fine. It is extremely tough to get them to admit (or you have clear evidence) to hearing it and doing nothing but only then the teacher has fault but the school still handled it wrong and should get in trouble for that... Who is responsible for what is up to the investigation to decide.", "This is a great idea.", "The media will be interested in a school faring to protect its female students, even if it cannot name the abuser.", "That\u2019s awful, I\u2019m so sorry that was done to you, and that your teacher failed you so badly"]}
