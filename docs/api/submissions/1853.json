I was confused. But everyone had gotten me gifts and there were 15+ people.\nI told her I could not go to that, but that I\u2019d be happy to eat dinner with everyone if they would all like to go to the club after without me. When I get to the resteraunt, they had brought the cake and balloons. The lady in question bought a dick shaped  lollipop and told me I had to suck on it since she bought it for me and it was expensive. I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing that at the moment in front of everyone, and she got angry and said it was selfish. I told them I was uncomfortable with the theme of this party in a public place where there were lots of people and children and excused myself, and left. The lady called me later and cussed me out because she said everyone came out to support me. She said literally everyone does that kinda stuff at a batchlorette party. She said I promised to go where she picked and I broke my promise. I was crying and it was a really difficult  experience to have two weeks before my wedding.

The point of throwing a bachelorette party is for the bachelorette to have fun. You made it clear to her what kind of party you would enjoy. She deliberately did the opposite. She does not sound like a good friend at all.", "Sounds like your friend threw a party for herself, not for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You said you didn't want anything wild, and she ignored your request. I didn't have a bachelorette party either, just a little bridal shower with snacks, a normal cake, and a few gifts from people. It was held in a relative's living room. Nothing offensive or adult-rated, no silly games or prizes. There's nothing wrong with wanting something tame instead of wild.", "NTA. She asked for your promise understanding your rules, so she expected you to comply but she didn\u2019t have too. She\u2019s not a friend.", "NTA. Like????? You made your stance clear about wanting something less... wild? She overstepped your boundaries and went against your one wish of it being more casual. She has no right to be angry.", "NTA, obviously.\n\nYou made your desires clear. This wasn\u2019t a party for you - it was a party for them.\n\nGood on you for leaving.", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" is terrible. She threw the party she'd want for herself, and completely disregarded your wishes.", "NTA x 1 million. That woman is not your friend. Friends respect your boundaries and values. I hope that you can out this behind you and enjoy your wedding.", "NTA, penis shaped anything in a restaurant where there are families is never, EVER ok.  It's trashy, plain and simple. At the club?  Hey, not an issue. Not around kids.  But, beyond that, you told her your boundaries for the entire evening's events and she completely disregarded them.  Not wanting to be forced to suck on a penis pop doesn't make you \"not ready for marriage\", it makes you not want  the effing thing.", "NTA \n\nNot everyone has that kind of bachelorette and she knew what you were comfortable with and went with what she wanted to do anyway. She used you as an excuse to have a wild, crazy night and then when you didn\u2019t go along with something she knew you would be uncomfortable she tries to guilt you into thinking you are wrong for having a boundary and not wanting what she considers the norm. I am sorry you were put in that position by someone who you thought was a friend.", "NTA- I\u2019ve been to a number of bachelorette parties where nothing is dick-shaped. I\u2019ve only been to one where there were dancers (we did not have a good time and left after about 10 minutes because it was weird). My sister is currently planning my bachelorette. We are doing a wine tour. I went to another where we rented a cabin and spend the day tubing with coolers. There is no traditional way to throw a bachelorette except maybe only inviting women, but that\u2019s not even a hard and fast rule.", "NTA. this was sexual harassment. trying to force you to perform a sexual act, even if it was just a lollipop, is gross. \n\nwhat she did was inappropriate and gross and against your wants and feeling. also i assume your bf has the same values as you, what would he have reacted like if he saw you sucking on a penis lollipop and grinding on strippers? no doubt that \"friend\" would have taken pictures and put them on social media for shit and giggles, so your conservative family most likely would have seen that too.\n\nlastly im concerned by the fact this *forty-four year old woman* acts like this around you.\n\nedit: just did a google search. penis shaped lollipop costs like, $15. yeah, expensive for a lollipop but its not exactly breaking the bank here", "NTA.  The party should have been for you and fun for you.  She should have known you wouldn't like that just because she knows you, but then you made it clear what your boundaries were and she just totally ignored them.  I think that was very disrespectful of her to do that.  And good for you for leaving when it became clear what it was.  I've seen posts here from both men and women that went along with things that their friends pushed them into at this type of party and created issues in their relationship.  In at least one case, the wedding was cancelled as a result of what happened.  You stuck to your standards and I think that's a good thing.", "The point of a bachelorette party is to celebrate you - not humilate you or make you uncomfortable.

This \"friend\" of yours is no friend, and tried to do all this for her own entertainment. I'm not saying she definitely wanted to humiliate you, but she certainly didn't care if she did. \n\nShe is no friend. I would have expected one of the other guests who knew your tastes to stand up to her in the moment and defend you. Are you sure all these people are really your friends and respect you?", "NO literally everyone does NOT do that shit at bachelorette parties. I'd also have walked out and I'm not even that conservative. I just find those types of parties low-class, tacky, and tasteless. You are NTA. You made your wishes clear and she agreed.", "NTA she betrayed you .", "NTA.\n\nShe knew you didn't want that kind of party, yet she went ahead and planned one cuz SHE wanted it.  You were not disrespectful but stuck to your beliefs.  Doesn't matter how much people spent on gifts if they made you uncomfortable.\n\nAnd just so you know, not all bachelorette parties are like that.  Many are just good friends getting together.  Doesn't have to be raunchy.", "NTA, I can\u2019t imagine in what universe she equated throwing a party for you with stampeding over your personal boundaries? My friends knew to not do that with me, we had a couples shower at my BFF\u2019s home, very low key which was exactly what I (the bride) wanted.", "I'd hire security and then let your friend know that she is not welcome at the wedding anymore and that you are not interested in being her friend moving forward\n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s awful that she blatantly ignored your guidelines for your celebration. \n\nFYI, I had none of that crap at my bachelorette and I\u2019m not at all conservative. I just didn\u2019t want it and so my friends didn\u2019t do it. Because they\u2019re my friends.", "NTA. You set clear terms on what kind of bachelorette party you wanted, and your \"friend\" blatantly disregarded all of it. It's your day, which means your party should cater to your wants at least a little. Your \"friend\" not only chose a party that *she* wanted, but she had the nerve to call you selfish when you weren't enjoying it. She knew how conservative you were, and how your family would likely react if they found out, then did it anyways. That is completely on her. \n\nSecondly, who does she think she is to tell you whether or not you're ready to be married? You don't like raunchy concepts, and to her, that means you're not ready to marry. I don't know what twisted logic she's using here, but at this rate, I don't want to know. I'm so sorry that this happened to you. Not only did she betray your trust by tricking you with that promise, she got pissy at you for not liking it. You deserve better friends than this. \n\nNext time she calls you, tell her that you're done with her. This was supposed to be your special night, and she ruined it from start to finish. With friends like her, who needs enemies?", "NTA!!! Terrible friend!!", "NTA sorry that happened", "NTA. You told her you didn't want anything wild. She went WAY over the top. I would have walked out of that too.", "Nta. I'm sorry  you 'friend' did that to you\n\n While it's true many bachelorette parties have a sexual theme to them... there isnt a rule you HAVE to have them that way. \n\n My friends  that was this year.. the closest  to dick theme was the penis straws we all drank out of.   . Her was more fun theme.    We got wedding dresses from goodwill  went to dinner at a restaurant, went to a club and ended the night  at a karaoke  bar.   We played bride bingo along the way.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUninvite these AH's from the wedding", "NTA at all! She did the exact opposite of what you wanted. She threw herself a raunchy party with no regards to your comfort level. I wouldn't want that. The cake in private I would think funny but sucking a sucker like that in public with balloons and that cake at a family restaurant absolutely not.", "NTA my friend hates everything you listed and guess what? We managed to have a kickass Bach without any D straws and no strip clubs. We focused on the things she liked and she had a great time. I\u2019ve planned two Bachs like this with no issue. Your \u201cfriends\u201d are not your friends and I would consider whether she needs to come to the actual wedding", "NTA. But so many questions!! You call her \u201cthe lady\u201d. Who is she??? A person 20 years older than you? Is she really a friend of yours? I don\u2019t understand the dynamic here.", "NTA She disrespected you. She was hoping you would loosen up a bit, but that is not you. You have to throw a party that closely aligns with the person the party is for. Bachelorette parties do tend to take people out of their comfort zones, but you should still have fun. This was too far out of your comfort zone for you to have fun. She needs to apologize. Keep being you.", "NTA I would've walked out too.\nThe party is for you, so if you don't enjoy it, there's something wrong. \n\n\nI'm pretty conservative myself and wouldn't stay. My own Bachelorette was a picknick in the park, an escape room, some tasks (that could be done by teenagers, so no raunchy stuff) and a nice diner to complete.\n\nIt was perfect for me, even though I know I will need to do the over the top stuff when my sister has her Bachelorette. She does like that stuff. But you know, it would be her party, not mine. Just like she organized my party to accommodate me, I will accommodate her.", "NTA - You stated your limits and preferences and they were not honored. Being pressured do to anything is NOT OK.  They are not your friends and no; this does not occur at all bach. parties. Clear your head, focus on what you want the next 2 weeks...month to be; that is what is important. Best to you.", "NTA. She's not your friend.", "Eugh, NTA. I am the opposite of conservative about sex, and I find typical bachelorette parties to be just embarrassing.\n\nSo many levels of she's the AH:\n\n1. \"Tee hee, everything's shaped like a dick\" is not that funny, and not everyone's cup of tea. \n2. It's meant to be a party to celebrate you, and it is not something you'd find fun.\n3. It is in fact, as you clearly communicated, something you would find really violating to be tricked into.\n4.

Out of all of my friends who have married, I have been to exactly 0 bachelorette parties that focused on a penis theme or a strip club. Most were spa days or wine tasting."]}
