My (25F) brother (29M) and my SIL (31F) recently had their lease ended. They have a new apartment, but not until December. My SIL is also 6 months pregnant. They have been staying with me for a while now and would be staying for another month since money is tight and hotels here are very expensive where I live.\n\nI\u2019m vegan and I have been for years, before that I was vegetarian. My brother has always been making fun of me for it. Before SIL and my brother moved in, I told them that I don\u2019t want any meat or fish in my house. The smell of fish and meat makes me gag, and I also love cooking and dont want my knives and pans touching it.\n\nMy SIL was fine with it, my brother complained but eventually agreed, since they don't have anywhere to go. Now, it went ok in the beginning, until I started to notice lots of packaging from meat in the trash can. I talked to my brother about it and he said he only cooked it when I wasn\u2019t there, so I wouldn\u2019t smell it. I really didn't like it because it had been in my pans and touched my knives and cutting board etc, but I decided to let it go and told him he could cook meat and fish when I\u2019m not there but use his own pans and knives. He said he would get his stuff in a few days (they\u2019re in storage) and then would wait cooking meat and fish until he got them.\n\nWell, last week he was cooking meat (I didn\u2019t notice immediately because I was in an online meeting in my bedroom), again in my pan and with my knives etc, because \u2018he didn\u2019t have time to get his stuff from his storage\u2019 (20 min drive). I got really mad and said it would be his last warning. A day later he started making bacon and eggs, again in my stuff. He then said he only cooked meat because of SIL\u2019s pregnancy cravings. She wasn\u2019t even there, didn\u2019t come home a few hours later, and I know she doesn\u2019t even like bacon. (Maybe she had pregnancy cravings but she wasn\u2019t even home, so it made no sense anyway). I wanted to let it go but when he started laughing in the evening to my SIL that he had such a lovely bacon sandwich, I kicked my brother out.\n\nNow he\u2019s been staying in a way too expensive hostel, sharing a room with 7 other people. My SIL said she finds it important to let her baby bond with the father (my brother) and is now also looking to stay at the same hostel or look for a hotel they can\u2019t afford. (She did understand me though, but I think she also thinks I overreacted). I feel bad for them, especially her, because it\u2019s not easy as a (pregnant) person to stay at an hostel while working etc, but I feel like I didn\u2019t kick her out and I gave him enough chances. I know it sounds silly because it\u2019s just meat and fish for many people, but I just don\u2019t want to live in a place like that. Or should I just have let it go? I feel disrespected. My friends are 50/50, I don\u2019t have any family to ask.\n\nSorry for my English, not my first language.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm not asking them to be vegan. I originally asked them to be vegetarian, then switched to cooking meat/fish in their own pans when I'm not present. Eggs + cheese have never been a problem and I wouldn't ask them to go vegan, especially not someone pregnant who knows nothing about veganism.", "created_utc": 1667228524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiekvu/aita_for_kicking_out_my_brother_and_indirectly_my/", "score": 627, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if it wasn't doctor's orders, it's pretty reasonable to assume that a pregnant person is going to need that much iron and protein. But, you did let them do that. All he had to do was get his own pans. And all he had to do was cook meat for her instead of cooking bacon for himself while you were home on your pans, which is exactly what you asked me out to do. It's also nice of you to continue to allow her to stay and I think that was the right choice. A person who's that pregnant probably shouldn't be staying at a hostel like that.

Sometimes the monthly price is comparable to area rent, and lots of hosts offer rentals now that are separate from the hosts living space. Your brother and SIL should definitely look into that as an option, probably cheaper and less stressful than hosteling for a month. The rental might even have a kitchen they can cook meat in. \n\nI was vegetarian for years, and though I'm not anymore (due to health issues), I totally get the need to avoid meat \"contamination\" for vegetarians, as any respectful person with empathy would.

When I encounter it \"in the wild\" these days (not as often, because I'm not targeted by it so much anymore) I'm quick to put those scumbags in their place.

You asked them to be vegetarian? For who, you? The animals?\ud83d\ude44 \n\nMy bff and her husband are vegetarian, and have some allergies. I lived with them for years and they never gave a shit about me cooking any kind of meat. I made sure not to cook anything that could get someone sick though, like spinach since one of them has a severe allergy and even smelling it causes nosebleeds. \n\nThey have the understanding that *soap works* and also, they go to restaurants like everyone else and even though they order meatless dishes, they are smart enough to realize that the cooking utensils, plates, forks and knives have all been touched by meat at some point. They realize their stuff at home is really no different. They host holiday get together where people bring or even prepare some dishes with and without meat and they\u2019re fine. They go to events where meatless options are often displayed next to meat options of the same thing (like egg rolls or dumplings for example) and are visually separated but displayed on the same board, and they simply eat the veggie version. Somehow this doesn\u2019t give them the vapors like it seems to give you. Your whole thing about this is frankly weird and feels judgmental and sanctimonious. \n\nHowever your brother definitely disrespected you by not using his own stuff if that\u2019s what you all agreed to.

I\u2019m on a keto diet rn, so no especially not.", "When my cousin was diagnosed she was in the ICU in organ failure and on a transplant list due to celiac. I can only speak to the severity of her condition but we are extremely careful as a result.\n\nETA: The doctors also refused to let her get henna tattoos at the beach or dye her hair because they weren\u2019t sure how she would react to anything absorbing through her skin.", "I'm a vegetarian who lives with a meat-eating roommate. I have no problem sharing a kitchen with someone preparing meat. However, if you were my family member I would never invite you to stay with me. Not because you eat meat, but because you have a horrible attitude and apparently only respect boundaries when they make sense or seem reasonable to you. That is NOT how boundaries work, especially when it comes to someone's private living space that they are gracious enough to invite you into. It doesn't matter if op's aversion to having meat prepared in her cookware is logical, it is HER cookware in HER home and she gets to decide what happens with it, full stop. \n\nIf she wants the house she pays for to be meat-free, she has every right to require that. She is under no obligation to come to a compromise that you or anybody else finds \"reasonable\" when she is letting her brother and SIL stay there rent free out of the kindness of her heart. OP is NTA, but you sound like kind of a judgmental jerk.", "You sure have a hair up your ass about vegetarians. Did one frighten you as a child?", "It was clearly about my house. I don't care what they eat outside. And I changed my ideas for them so they could cook it in their own pans. And my SIL chooses to leave.", "I definitely would have taken that in consideration, of course. Thank you for your comment. And of course, if I stayed at someones house and they would hate the smell of bell peppers and potatoes (my favorite foods haha), I would've not eaten it. Hope your health is okay and of course I understand veganism is not for everybody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: just realized I say 'of course' very often lol", "Doesn't matter. People are vegans for religious beliefs. Someone could believe meat needs to be cooked with meals in their house. Reasoning doesn't matter.\n\nWould you consider them an AH for putting that condition?", "Lol, I never said I don\u2019t follow boundaries. People are allowed to have opinions on certain \u201cboundaries\u201d being stupid and I gave several other equally ridiculous examples. Idc about vegetarians and have several as friends, none of whom would never act like OP, but no, I don\u2019t enjoy people who proselytize their eating rituals and compare them to religion. \n\nI simply wouldn\u2019t stay somewhere where the hosts felt they had the right to make ridiculous requests of me just because it\u2019s their house. Telling me to be a vegetarian is just as ridiculous as telling me to become a Muslim or whatever else. Just because I state that opinion on Reddit doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d say exactly the same thing the same way IRL lol so you are making a lot of assumptions there. As I said I simply wouldn\u2019t want to stay there. \n\nI also stated that the brother was an AH for not adhering to what was agreed and using the cookware, even if I felt OP\u2019s reason was silly. So idk why you\u2019re lecturing me about how she gets to say whatever about how \u201cHER\u201d cookware is used, because I already said that and said brother was an AH for that. \n\nMost gracious hosts I know ask their guests what they like to eat, rather than telling them what they can and can\u2019t eat. Maybe it\u2019s different where you\u2019re from idk. \n\nStay mad I guess  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af you\u2019re over here acting like I said YTA and let the brother off the hook which I didn\u2019t, and I guess taking it personally cause of your own eating habits and reasoning for them?? Idk not my problem lol have a good night", "It's kind of a silly hypothetical because I don't think anyone actually holds a genuine belief like you described, but yes, I would say if someone for some reason genuinely believes strongly that all meals prepared in their home MUST contain meat, then that's a boundary that should be respected by any guests, and vegans/vegetarians would need to find alternative housing arrangements.", "Exactly. I am saying your belief that some boundaries are \"stupid\" or \"ridiculous\" is what makes you kind of a jerk. Just because it doesn't seem like a big deal to you doesn't mean it isn't genuinely a big deal to someone else. Get over yourself and try to have some empathy for others.", "A lot of trivial things are a \u201cbig deal\u201d to a lot of people. \nThis seems to be a growing thing in recent years. \n\nEmpathy is not about validating every whim of someone\u2019s feelings no matter what. Some \u201cboundaries\u201d are straight up toxic or bigoted, some are intentionally manipulative, and some are well meaning but misguided. Just because something is labeled a \u201cboundary\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always morally right and beyond question. Some boundaries are, but in reality not all. If I had a gay family member staying with me and said they could stay but my boundary is that they can\u2019t see their partner or talk about their relationship while they\u2019re in my house, it might technically be my right to have that rule as it\u2019s my house and visitors go through me, but I\u2019d still be a bigoted dick for doing that. \n\nSome of us live in reality where not everything is as important as everything else, and where there is an objective reality about some things. Like, family > pots and pans. \n\nYou can call me a jerk for thinking ESH  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af no sweat off my back", "NTA - you set boundaries, your brother repeatedly pushed and broke these boundaries. You didn\u2019t overreact at all, it was your SIL decision to follow her husband rather than side with you and make him see sense.  I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that, your brother is the AH here.", "If that\u2019s a valid argument what about the sister values her pans and utensils higher than her brother?"]}
