So she beat the hell out of me, bounced me off of the floor a few times, then pinned me down while praying for the \u201cdemon\u201d to leave.  I\u2019m over 40 now.  And apparently she\u2019s in poor health.  A huge chunk of my family gives me crap about not wanting anything to do with her, because she was \u201ctrying to help\u201d.  They as well, cannot seem to understand why I have such an issue with her.  Well they\u2019re part of the same cult/religion as she is.

I'll never forget the time I was sitting at a table close to the open door to the outdoor patio.  A very small child had been running all over the dining room and screaming at the top of his lungs.  It was very annoying but the two couples who were with the child were completely ignoring him.  Then the kid went running through the door to the patio at full speed and was running toward the street which was busy with cars.  I jumped up when he ran past to chase after him to keep him from getting hit.  Before I could get to him, a waiter who was serving a table on the patio grabbed him.  The waiter carried the kid back to the adults' table.  Their response?  They just laughed.  They didn't thank the guy or anything.  He basically saved their kid's life but they thought it was funny.  As we were leaving, I handed the guy a ten and told him he was a hero and I hoped the next time I was in, he'd be my waiter.  The guy's eyes actually teared up.\n\nNTA.  Restaurants can be dangerous places for unsupervised children not to mention the wait staff who are carrying heavy trays and moving really quickly.  Stick to your rules and I hope other restaurant owners do the same.\n\nP.S.  I love kids but there are some places that aren't conducive to them.", "Exactly. Brother is missing the point. The other customers are the ones who are going to object.   OP effectively made a promise to them that their meal wont be impacted by kids, and bro is asking him to break that business deal.   Four years is a nightmare age for restaurants anyway.", "While I, as a former hospitality professional, never got the idea that kids where more of a potential problem than any other age group, I can absolutely see where having a restaurant without them ( I would even do 16 as the cutoff) can have an appeal to a certain type of customer.\nIf this is the expectation, you are absolutely right the owner should not make an exception.", "OP is definitely NTA, and her brother is an AH for trying to argue and assuming OP would make an exception, but I'm slightly concerned by this comment ngl. \n\n\"incandescent with rage\" if the OWNER of a small business made an exception for their own family member (if let's say, it was OP's idea and OP's choice)?\n\nLike, don't get me wrong, I think OP is 100% in the right in this situation, because it was the brother who wanted a special exception to be made for him, without checking it first and then arguing about it, but if OP had been the one planning on inviting the family, while including the kid, OP would perfectly be within their rights to make whatever exception they want. \n\nIf OP decided their family didn't need to pay, for example, that shouldn't be a problem because OP is the owner and makes the rules.", ">NTA. If I went to a restaurant that I knew didn't serve children and I walked in and there was a child, I would be mad.\n\nYes, this is it exactly.  OP's business increased when he banned kids under 12yo. That means his diners expect there to be no kids.  Not a good look for OP to have a kid in his restaurant, family or not.", "I love this. This is how I was raised. And when I was old enough my mom always told it was special that I could come with and had to behave.", "I would be more pissed if it were the owners nephew. So is this temporary or is he gonna be a constant figure, every time I come here?", "I would support it too, we need more restaurants like yours! I have kids but when on a romantic date night. I obvi don\u2019t want my kids around, let alone anyone\u2019s elses. Hence why I paid a babysitter!", "Absolutely! All sorts of people for all sorts of reasons. Enjoy a child free space every now and then or all the time. I am a child free nanny and I know that if I go someplace after work, I also want to be around adults and not worry about whatever the hell the kids are doing at the table next to me.", "Where?", "If a go to a place because it's child free, and obviously some of OP clients were there for that reason, I would be livid if there is a child there. \n\nAnd the kid would not be my nephew. \n\nLetting the kid in would have a good chance to cause problems to OP businesses, and there is no reason to do that besides the entitlement of the parents.  They could have gone both to the restaurant or go to a family friendly place, but they wanted to be special.", "The contracts for cleaning inside the tubes (kids crawling through) got so expensive, and they would need ongoing cleaning.  (Right after being cleaned, kids would vomit, piss, poop in there and the like).  That is why they started taking them out and then could totally cancel those contracts for that vendor that cleaned.", "A friend told me some restaurants in Korea (I think?) banned kids because some parents aren\u2019t keeping their eyes on their kids so when accidents occurs like sticking a fork in an outlet, the parents automatically held the restaurant responsible. Definitely some shitty parents out there for sure.", "This is exactly right! I don't hate kids, I just hate some of their parents!", "This depends on the country and culture. In the UK many pubs serve food so families will come in during the day and early evening for meals out. Many pubs do have rules around where kids can be, but in the end they're in a pub and adults are drinking around them", "He wasn\u2019t a very good illusionist.", "True", "Yes, no one considered how unsanitary it really was to let their kids go crawling through tubes sure to be full of pee, poop and even vomit.  And you can't even see in there.", "As kids we were taught how our parents wanted us to behave in restaurants. We were rewarded for our good behavior by being taken to nicer restaurants than chains or \"family\" restaurants. I don't think a lot of these parents are even attempting to teach their children.", "Literally same when I was growing up. Then (and to this day\u2026I\u2019m 40\ud83d\ude2d) whenever I go to any* restaurant the first thing I do is put my napkin in my lap.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m doing it..my friends tease me. Huge thing for my mom since i could remember.

KUDOS!  While I wouldn't be angry to see a family guest there that is under age (someone said they'd be FURIOUS...which seems a bit extreme and a wild expenditure of energy), it would be slightly frustrating if they were noisy or had their stupid tablet turned up...or any other issues.  It's family...and I'd understand if the kid was quiet and had manners.  That being said...NTA.  It's your place and he knew the rules!", "NTA. Everyone wants to be special. The Reality is they aren\u2019t and if that\u2019s too harsh for them too bad.", "NTA. Your restaurant, your rules. I\u2019d love to visit :) never heard of an age restricted restaurant before and I hope it becomes a thing !", "As a parent, I have to say -\nI would fucking love to eat at a child free restaurant. OMG. Is it quiet? I bet it's quiet. It would be like when people who work in offices go to places that aren't offices. That rule is a hill to die on! NTA!", "As a parent I would frequent your business whenever possible. nta", "NTA\n\nEspecially having a small restaurant where one table that is chaotic can drown out every other conversation at other tables, even as a parent I completely support this and commiserate. Anyone with or without children who feels this is a problem or takes issue with your decision is a self centered prick you\u2019re probably better off without as a customer anyway. I love my kids but definitely don\u2019t place that expectation on complete strangers in a small quiet space. And 12 is very reasonable. I\u2019m sorry your brother doesn\u2019t have respect for your boundaries and your livelihood.", "He knew the restrictions and I think it\u2019s the worse when relative think they can abuse the whole \u201cI\u2019m related to them I get extra\u201d thing.  \nJust imagine if you had let him in?

You denied your nephew service, which is a bit odd, but I respect how you stuck to your guns even to your family. \n\nDid you at least give them some food to go?", "Hope they go no contact with you. You're NTA but a horrible human and family member", "YTA. But not because of the restaurant thing. It's because you said \"backslash\" instead of \"backlash.\"", "I imagine Timmy busting into the kitchen shrieking like Godzilla then smashing the prep station, taking out a line cook at the knee, and peeing in the walk-in before the head chef grabs him by the back of the shirt and drops him in a trashcan where the prep people have been putting the fish guts, heads, and bones for the fresh lake trout dinner special.", "[2(NTA)\u00b2]!", "My daughter was impeccably well behaved growing up, but if we went anywhere that was childfree, we wouldn't have her with us. I don't know why parents expect every place to pander to parents all the time.

Usually, it was my own family letting the kids annoy people. I couldn't care less most of the time but, if I booked something special and a crying kid ruined it, I would be pissed, especially due to the rule.", "There's a BBQ place near me and it has kids eat free even on the weekends.

I and my brother (1959 / 1962) knew how to behave in a restaurant by five, at least. We had to behave at our family dinner table, just as you described, also with proper table manners, management of flatware (as our little hands became accustomed) and proper use of a napkin. \"Practicing \" at home, every night, meant that restaurant behavior was quite similar.\n\nIn our area, many families went out for lunch after church, dressed in our nice clothes. If little ones acted up, parents took turns removing them from the dining area, until kids were calm.\n\nAs children, we liked to eat out. Certainly weren't going to ruin the opportunity by bad behavior.\n\nWhen I was seven, Mom and I went shopping in the big town, nicely dressed for the occasion. Treated ourselves to lunch at a white-tablecloth cafeteria that we favored. I was very careful with my table manners, of course! As we were starting on dessert, a elegant older woman stopped by our table, and complimented my mother and me on my good manners. I had noticed this lady watching us, throughout our meal. Mom was proud, so was I.", "I wish I knew where you lived so I could go!", "Whelp OP it's pretty universal that you're NTA stick to your guns and hell I'd use this as proof how everyone feels about it because a random sampling like this is pretty much the same as polling your customer base.

Though given that they were just visiting with OP's parents, I'm pretty sure that if they asked them to watch their kid that one evening so they could check out OP's restaurant, the parents would have probably been happy to have their grandchild for themselves for an evening.", "Two corpses, everything's fine.", "SHOOTING out the SIDES of my FACE!", "The child was reportedly four years old.
