I am always surprised when people bring toddlers who want to run around to fancy restaurants.

I mean, your guests that you chose to host aren't entitled to shit, lol\n\nIf you think the way to maintain relationships with people you love is to walk around only doing the bare minimum they are entitled to then you will have a lonely life. \n\nI've known many people who own restaurants or sole proprietor businesses and it's really common for them to have family and friends over for special meals/activities.", "Which is why he could give a little tour and private meal before opening, or as OP suggested, give them takeout. \n\nMy point is there are multiple options here to make everyone in the family feel good.", "See there you go :) Maybe offer to bring them takeout tonight?", "I know that you\u2019re being extreme because you disagree with the post but if OP is childfree I see that as a win-win?
