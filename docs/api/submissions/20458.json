I am not having a wedding because the thought of my parents being in the same room is enough to give me an anxiety attack.", "Make sure your wife really is ok with it, that she hasn't complained to her father, and if she is ok, go and enjoy your trip.", "NTA THIS FATHER HAS NO RIGHT TO TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT. Your the husband, the fathers got to get tf out of there", "Nta. When your wife is okay with it, do what you think.  Your son surely gets a core memory going to his last childhood vacation with both of his parents.", "Could everyone not go on this trip? Maybe rent a bigger RV to accommodate the other kids and stepmom too?", "Just a question do you ever go on trips with your wife?", "YTA, it's perfectly fine for exs to be around each other for their kids. What's not fine is having the same accommodations. Firstly would it be cool to camp in Yellowstone,  fuck yes, that said you don't have to. As someone that has been to Yellowstone and can't wait to go back there are plenty of hotels within 45 minutes of the park's edge and you don't have to be locked into 1 location. My suggestion would be stay in hotels and spend the week navigating the park utilizing all 3 park entrances and there's even cabins to rent in the park.", "But you\u2019re still not really saying why you\u2019re wife isn\u2019t going.. other than your son wants it to be \u201cjust\u201d you and his mom.", "No it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t care how \u2018blended\u2019 a family is, you don\u2019t go off for a solid week to hang out with your ex and practically adult son in a camper.

It\u2019s great that the parents get along, but what part of one of them being remarried to another person with children doesn\u2019t everyone understand? I\u2019m not saying to forget his son, not in the least!! But it would have been beneficial to at least TRY to be inclusive with everyone.. I don\u2019t understand why some of the comments are basically saying eff the wife and other kids\u2026 a blended family is that.. blended! You try to get along for everyone\u2019s sake..", "As a child of divorce\u2026that could literally just be it.

Because the majority of tourists who go there do actually stay in hotels. Separate rooms at a hotel is a whole other story.", "Not really.  A two or three person tent would be weird.  Campers have more than a single bunk.", "OK, I can definitely see how that's inappropriate", "So...  slight YTA.   I think you likely didn't do enough to get affirmative confirmation that your wife didn't have an issue with the situation and assumed she was ok with it.  \n\nIt appears to me that she does have an issue or concern and said something to her dad.  The worst case with that is that she asked him to say something to you because she feels she can't.  I would find that out - because then you have a larger communication problem with your wife.\n\nAlso, is your ex remarried and if so, what does her new husband think?", "Right? I feel like the wording is purposely deceptive throughout the post. Title is \u201cAITA for going to Yellowstone\u201d when it should be \u201cAITA for going on a trip with my ex.\u201d We don\u2019t even find out son\u2019s mom is the ex until the third paragraph. OP posted to Reddit before talking to his wife. All of which leads me to believe this is a YTA post.", "THAT is not the same as asking her how she feels about it. TRUTH revealed right there. You didnt ask because you knew you were an AH and the way you went about it makes you an Ugly Coward.", "YTA...when you get divorced and remarried you shouldn't go on vacation with your ex. You are sleeping in the same camper. It would be the same as sharing a hotel rm. Why would you put your wife through that", "But above you say it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if your wife objected because you don\u2019t need her permission to do things. She probably knew that would be your attitude so didn\u2019t bother objecting.", "yeah lol someone said \"this is what a blended family looks like\" umm like what, forgetting the \"blended\" part and acting like no divorce took place and excluding everyone else?", "He adores his step and half siblings and has a cordial relationship with my wife.", "She is not remarried.

Why does there need to be another reason? This is literally the last time he can fully be treated as their kid. Any good parents would fulfill their child's reasonable wishes as you send them off into adulthood. It is the last time he'll get a chance to do this so it's not that big of a deal to let him ask for this.", "I agree that there needs to be a talk with your son about family boundaries. \n\nBoundaries exist to keep everyone feeling safe in a relationship. This includes boundaries within a family system.\n\nA child will also always test boundaries. It's how they figure out where they begin and others end. \n\nThis feels like \"The Parent Trap\" and I don't think you're helping your son by playing into his fantasy of a family reunion.

I see it on this forum all the time people acting like everyone should do this \"for the kids\" but as a kid of divorced parents who split when I was ten I can tell you it NEVER once bothered me that my mum and dad didn't get together for christmases or not going on a holiday with \"mum and dad\" together.", "Agree!

Thank you for answering my question. This is a very very hard decision to make on my part.. but let me explain..\n\nYour in a blended family situation, and it seems everyone gets along which is what\u2019s best for all concerned. However, I feel your ex didn\u2019t take everyone into consideration here, especially your current wife or her current partner. (From what I\u2019m gathering) and I don\u2019t feel you did either. I totally understand that in your excitement of the trip planning some things were definitely not discussed with everyone involved and that\u2019s not cool. What kind of woman makes plans with her ex without regard to the current relationships your both in? Please don\u2019t get me wrong.. I love that you\u2019re doing something great for your son.. and that you both get along well enough to do so .. it\u2019s very good for your son. But I truly feel that both you and your ex didn\u2019t think of the possibility of having hurt feelings involved. While I feel your father in law was incredibly inappropriate in confronting you the way he did, obviously your wife was upset enough to tell him how she felt. \n\nSoft YTA and so is your ex for not making a better plan considering everyone\u2019s feelings in this. I hope you have a good time, but don\u2019t think that there\u2019s not some resentment you\u2019re leaving behind. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m happy for your son getting to take a trip and congratulations on his graduation! I don\u2019t know if you can fix this somehow, but I hope you try.  Because I feel it\u2019s highly inappropriate to do this without everyone discussing it at the same time while in the planning stage.", "It wasn't an insane assumption. You're fine.", "My bad on the terms I used on my assumptions of her sexuality.", "I'd say based on FILs chat with OP that his wife is in fact not okay but OP has told her he's doing this and 'kept her in the loop'.", "You dont ask her how things would make her feel... that makes you an insensitive egocentric coward.", "Still disrespectful.", "Should have. Totally agree. He also should have asked her.", "Agree to disagree. Because I feel that because everyone gets along well, everyone should have had a conversation together because it\u2019s a blended family. It\u2019s what you do.. you consider everyone\u2019s feelings in this.. you\u2019re not wrong.. but his wife got hurt here because his ex and he made all these plans without even considering his wife or his ex\u2019s partner in all this.. I do understand it\u2019s great for his son \u2026 and I hope he has a blast. Truly. But all I\u2019m saying is everyone should have had their feelings heard and acknowledged. I\u2019m not saying that they shouldn\u2019t go.. I\u2019m saying that they didn\u2019t discuss it like the blended family that they are is all.", "I feel he should perhaps tell the thread how the sons relationship is with the stepmother too.. that would give better perspective for a judgment.", "It's not too late to cancel the whole damn trip.", "Y'all clearly weren't children of divorce. This is absolute nonsense. You get divorced because the marriage part of your relationship wasn't working. There's other aspects of a relationship. Now you're coparents. That means you still see each other. My mom and dad would go on some vacations together after they divorced. It was a good time NTA. Go on the trip. Have a nice time before your son moves to college. Bunch of clowns in the comments.", "Wait....so you asked what date  was okay.  Did you ask her how she felt about you and ex wife going on a 5 day trip???", "It doesn't matter if the son loves the current wife and half-siblings to the ends of the earth.  The trip with just OP, son and ex-wife never should have been even talked about in the first place.  Also, if even if the current wife was invited, what woman wants to spend 5 freakin' days in the presence of an ex-wife?", "theres not enough info for me to decide one way or the other right now.", "They are our kids. We've both gone on trips before. Of course the other parent is going to be watching the kids.", "It's not a secret, so he could have found out from anyone. They don't have any sort of relationship.", "Wouldn't the equivalent scenario be her, my step kids and her ex? I would have no problem with this. If my wife's ex wanted to do something with the step kids, it makes sense for her to tag along, because she doesn't trust his judgement with them.", "That is literally Not comparable. They are leaving for their CHILDS trip while the child is also in the room. Its not a random trip with some mutual friend without a reason, it is literally for their child. OP will not have Quality time with his ex, he wants his child to have Quality time with both his parents because that is want the child wishes for. Which is understandable", "What woman would disregard the current wife\u2019s feelings in the matter? In a blended family.. you don\u2019t do that.. you consider everyone in the family and their feelings.. you\u2019re not wrong!", "OP keeps saying she had time to object which definitely leans towards he told her rather than discussed it with her. I can see why his son would want his parents there but it's something he should discuss properly with his wife.", "Did you ask her if she was OK with watching the kids while you went on this trip?", "Your 18yo son would be playing the role of the \"Friend who introduced them\", creating a situation where a romantic incident could occur between his bio mom and bio dad in a mostly secluded location.   He is an old enough to be comfortable with you guys having sex and aware that if you and your ex were put into a potentially romantic situation things could happen.  All he then needs to do is make himself a little scarce while you and your ex share quality time in a sleeping bag.  Even if none of that is his current intent, I doubt he would object to it if it happened.\n\nThat's the situation you are intending to walk into.  Going to someplace very remote, with your ex, where cell service is very limited, and depending on where you are in the park non-existent. Its unlikely you could talk to your wife regularly to ease her mind while you are there.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable with your wife doing the same kind of thing with an ex lover, then you're being an ass just like her dad said you are.\n\nYou should be explaining that this doesn't look good to your son and either your ex wife's current partner needs to come too or your wife needs to come or both.  Maybe have grandpa watch the kids (he clearly knows where you live).", "From the wife's point of view, the 18 yo son was a key part of why the ex and her husband were together, almost like a \"friend who introduced them\".  It wouldn't be a leap to believe that the son would prefer to see his bio dad with his bio mom again and would be willing to give them some quality alone time in the evening.", "\"It's his son's trip....\"  Is the son footing the bill?  Probably not.  \n\nOP shouldn't have agreed to this trip in the first place.  If it were just OP and his son, that's fine.  OP, son and ex-wife?  No.  Just no.  It doesn't matter if there is 0% chance anything romantic or sexual or romantic would go on between OP and his ex.  This little Trio Trip needs to be altered or cancelled altogether.", "If you tell your partner you're going on a trip during x dates, taking care of the house, kids, and pets is a pretty basic assumption for any adult. \n\nHe doesn't need to spell out \"I'm going on a trip are you okay with needing to mind the kids, wash the dishes, feed the dogs, lock the doors\" that's silly.", "We never have asked that before. Usually if there is an issue with watching the kids the other person will bring it up and we will reschedule or make plans. Like, I had a business trip once that overlapped with her sister being in town, so we had the kids stay with my best friend.", "What did I just read?", "So because OP remarried, he doesn't get to be a parent to his own son? Glad you never had to deal with divorce in your life, but not everyone has that luxury.", "Sloppy fanfic, at a guess. Lol", "Someone who thinks The Parent Trap was an inspirational documentary", "When the son starts paying for the trip, he gets to decide the guest list.  Regardless of that, the trip should not have been planned to begin with.  OP is married to someone else. Going on a multi-day road trip with an ex-spouse is inappropriate and ridiculous.  If OP and his ex-wife were both still single, it might be a different story.  That's not the situation.", "No, I understand, and it\u2019s definitely a plus that the parents get along because it\u2019s definitely benefiting the child. But we can agree it\u2019s a unique situation to be in.. and not one I\u2019d want to be in for certain. I made a comment in our thread here that said pretty much the same thing. Sorry if I sounded rude to you.", "LOL  This isn't about parenting!  This has nothing to do with actual parenting.  This is about the son wanting to go on a multi-day road trip with his divorced parents, one of whom is remarried with a current spouse.  The idea the 3 of them should or would take the trip never should have been entertained from the second it was proposed.", "That perspective is so immature. If all the parties are mature adults who understand that parenting comes first, there shouldn't be any issues. The son shouldn't suffer because OP maybe didn't handle this situation in the best way possible.", "Definitely, I didn't have that growing up, and it caused a lot of irreparable issues within my family.\n\nI totally agree with you there.\n\nNo worries, I get that this particular subreddit can get pretty heated, so no hard feelings."]}
