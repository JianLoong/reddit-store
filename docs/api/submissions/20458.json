It's not appropriate for you to be going on a road trip with your ex-wife no matter how your current wife may feel about it.

It should have been shot down the second it was proposed you, son and ex-wife would take a 5-day road trip together.  I get your son wanting to spend some time with just his parents. Great.

I feel maybe OP should have been more clear in the original post so that there\u2019s not so many confusing questions", "Did you not read my comment?! I SAID he should talk to his son.. better yet, explained to his son that it will be hurtful to not have his family come when they were freaking planning the trip! When you remarry.. and have children from a former marriage, you try to communicate and compromise with everyone.. you don\u2019t go around leaving people out (if possible).. there\u2019s a lot of information missing here and it\u2019s shady. You don\u2019t know the relationship either so yo speak because he\u2019s leaving out a lot of info. \n\nI truly understand the want of the son to just have his parents.. but I feel this whole thing was badly planned out without the involvement of his now wife at all. If she wasn\u2019t upset.. how did her father know? She had to have told him right?", "I did, but what you don't seem to understand is that it's ultimately the son's decision. If he says no, that's the end of the story. It's not \"hurtful\" when maybe he's trying to avoid a conflict between his mother and stepmother, and just wants to enjoy *his* trip with *his* parents without the possible tension that situation would create. Considering they had planned it with just his mom and OP, it's really not unreasonable to assume he just didn't want the step-family to come on his trip. Yes, OP has commitments to both of his families, but I'm talking mainly from the son's perspective, not OP's. And that's OP'S problem to deal with, he shouldn't be putting that on his son.\nAnd that's what I said in my own post- how did the FIL know for him to get involved in the first place? I've been suspicious of OP's wording almost from the start, so at this point, I'm on the son's side, as I'm also a child of divorce."]}
