Jamie can eat around her Keto diet for one evening just like every lactose, glutton, vegetarian, pescatarian does.  etc.  \n\nAs long as you have some dishes she can eat you're doing your job as host.  You might want to see if you can buy a Keto dessert for her.  They are objectively horrible so I wouldn't serve it to everyone, but it would be a nice gesture.", "Really depends on the tone of how you responded. I don\u2019t think you should have to go completely out of your way to accommodate but it\u2019s not that difficult to offer to put some meat aside for them.", "NTA. It sounds like you are accommodating him. \n\nIf you cook one or more meat dish with minimal carbs he can eat that. If the meat dish has carbs it would be very kind of you try to cook a portion without.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with cooking some dishes that so not fit the dietary requirements of some of your guests as long as other dishes do.", "NTA kinda\n\nI mean if you make a pasta meal then yeah, that's rude bc he won't be able to enjoy. \n\nBut it sounds like he can have the protein and veggies. You can always make a mini cucumber tomato salad for him to have as a side - this is 1 minute of chopping. \n\nDessert - he is on his own. I would let him know what you will have and that you don't know anything about keto baking. Let him decide if he would like to bring something. I would probably pick up like a keto brownie maybe. \n\nHonestly for 4 ppl - I would make a bit of effort to accommodate just to be a good host. \n\nLike I recently had vegetarians at my thanksgiving and I made a point to make them a small squash as \"main\" (decorative etc) so that they weren't literally just eating sides.

Just talk to Jamie about it as a keto desserts can be hard to make for people who have never done it. Where im from, you can buy keto desserts for under $10 from the supermarket.\nYou can even tell Jamie what you plan to serve and see if he is all good with that menu or if he needs to bring his own dessert if that suits him better.\nIt would be rude to invite someone to a dinner party and not give them the heads up if they can't eat anything there.", "exactly.
