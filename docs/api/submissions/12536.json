Last night she had her first sleep over with a friend of hers and my wife was hesitant but ultimately accepted. We checked in with her through the evening and she was picked up this morning. When they got home my daughter made a comment about playing outside in the front yard for a little bit alone and going across the street to the other kids friends house, rang the bell said hello and come back. My wife was very unhappy about this, specifically the playing in the front yard by themselves as she's not allowed to do that at home, let alone go around the neighborhood by herself. The reason is that when my wife was 10 she was almost abducted on her block doing the same thing, playing in the front and a car rolled up, stopped, a dude got out but her grandmother saw and scared the guy off. My wife carries that with her and broke down in tears at the mention of my daughter playing alone in the front.\n\nI am sympathetic to her experience and understand her hesitation but I also realize how exceedingly rare something like that is and that it's not unreasonable for 9 and 10 year old kids to play in the front yard. I, hamfistedly I guess, tried to explain that but it made things worse and now we're on the outs. I tried to explain I didn't think she was wrong for being upset that our daughter did something she knew she wasn't supposed to and that she wasn't wrong for being uncomfortable with the situation, but that I didn't think it rose to the level of reaction she was having. Apparently though I'm not in it with her, I think she's wrong for feeling how she does and she's going to have to handle it alone.\n\nI'm annoyed with my daughter for doing something she knew she wasn't allowed to do at home and then being so blase about it when she told us so in that respect we're in agreement. I also recognize nothing happened and in all likelihood wouldn't happen. But I know that odds and statistics don't do much to sway a fear like that.\n\nI don't know what the point of any of this is, I guess was I out of line in saying anything?", "created_utc": 1679072634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11twzfa/aita_for_not_immediately_siding_with_my_wife_on_a/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs therapy and your support.\n\nYou're right, it's not unreasonable for 9 year old kids to do what they did but all she heard was \"you're wrong and I don't care about your experience.\"", "NAH. Your wife's experience sounds deeply traumatic. One doesn't move on from the fears generated thus very easily. I think you did goof citing statistics (as you obviously realize), & I think the way forward is to validate her concerns. After all, insisting your daughter not play out front alone (that is, without adults present) isn't a huge ask. I think you both just have to give her time & space here & perhaps she'll feel better about things as your daughter grows older.", "Your wife really needs to work through this trauma with a mental health professional.", "NTA\n\nYour wife NEEDS help to get past that big event. Your daughter shouldn't have to suffer for her mamas trauma though. She needs to be able to be a kid and go outside and play with friends", "NTA. \n\nYour wife hasn't dealt with her trauma. Breaking down in tears is troubling because she is in no state to discuss the situation logically. Your daughter is getting to an age where this will become more and more an issue.", "NAH.\n\nNine is not an unusual age to have a sleep-over so good for your wife for pushing her fears aside and letting your daughter go.\n\nIt's part of a child's development to experience how other families operate.  In this case, your daughter's friend's parents are less cautious than you and your wife.  That can be a good thing if there isn't a lot of risk in what they allow their kids to do.  Keep in mind there is risk in everything.\n\nInfo:  without knowing more such as:\n- is this a busy street or a quiet residential street?\n- is this a relatively safe neighbourhood?\n- were the friend's parents home?\n- and when you said she was playing \"alone\", you did mean with her friend, right?\n\nIt's not possible for us to assess how risky this situation was without more info.\n\nOf course your wife carries trauma from her own experience and the challenge for her is to recognize how that is impacting her parenting.  You don't want your daughter to become paranoid.  As well, you don't want to restrict her to the point where as she gets older she sneaks around.\n\nHow did your daughter feel about playing in the front and going across the street?  Was she comfortable with it?\n\nIt's important not to over-react or she will stop telling you and your wife what's going on.", "NTA, but it's difficult to say your wife is TA either because she's probably having a trauma response and lashing out (which is shitty, unfair to you and your daughter, and is not a good way of handling it), but sometimes it just doesn't rise to the level of asshole-ry because it's probably not a conscious decision on her part, more like a symptom of poor coping skills.", "NAH but what your wife experienced was obviously traumatic and having a daughter only heightened her fear it could happen to her own child. She takes safeguards and when she learned her daughter wasn\u2019t safeguarded for a period of time she reacted, and based on her previous trauma her reaction seems somewhat justified. She\u2019s scared it could happen to her own daughter/child. I think that\u2019s everyone\u2019s fear. Her feelings are valid, her fears are valid, please encourage her to see someone professionally to deal with her past trauma so she\u2019s not impacting her daughter with her own issues.", "NAH but yea, kids tend to grow up better if they can play outside.

Your daughter may not understand that your rules apply wherever she is, not just in your home. You and your wife also had a responsibility to communicate your rules to your daughter\u2019s friend\u2019s parents.

She hasn\u2019t processed her trauma to determine reasonable things to teach her daughter how to protect herself.  She is reacting to the trauma by restricting her daughter which won\u2019t make her safer, it will make her less safe.\n\nYour daughter could be taking karate to learn how to defend herself.  In karate, they teach the kids that karate is all about self defense, and using your skills is the last resort, the first is getting a nearby adult or running towards where people are screaming for help.\n\nYour daughter also needs to learn situational awareness so that she is always putting herself in the safest position.\n\nYour wife is so consumed with her trauma, that she isn\u2019t teaching your daughter what she needs to know.

Your wife\u2019s unresolved trauma is not an excuse to restrict your daughter like that.

Plus, she had a traumatic event when she was around that age, so her anxieties make plenty of sense. You, on the other hand, think she is being overbearing, and that\u2018s where I falter.

I have heard of other states with bad kidnappings too tho just can't cite them at the current moment", "NAH hard one.  Your daughter is not your wife, but she is reliving trauma through her.  She needs to discus with a professional.\nMy advice, listen to her fears.  Don\u2019t talk.  Listen and validate her feelings because she is allowed to have them.  State, our daughter is home and fine.  I\u2019ll handle this with our daughter.\nYou aren\u2019t going to solve it.  And she\u2019s not going to be happy with your response unless it is 100% aligned with her traumatic fears.  Best to just reassure her your daughter is fine.  Bring up addressing her fears in therapy later.\nGood luck!", "NTA.  It's good to teach your child to be careful and be aware of what's going on around them, but you can't have them living in constant fear because of an old trauma.  She really needs to talk this over with a therapist."]}
