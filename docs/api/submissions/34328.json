Told the women, 'sorry my gf doesnt trust me, so I cant sit and talk with you on my guys night out with my friend' ?", "No. NTA. I'm going to take you by your word when you say you made it clear to the other women you were in a relationship.  \nYour gf's standards are totally blown out of proportion.   \nIt's sad that many people see relationships more as a form of property arrangement, instead of a partnership based on trust.", "NTA sorry being in a relationship doesn't mean you never get to socialize with others, the same sex as your partner.  She's immature and jealous.  Honestly, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nNo it was not wrong of you. Your GF is immature and insecure.", "NTA.\n\nBeing in a relationship doesn't mean you're barred from talking to people of your preferred gender(s). You have been open, established your relationship status, and being supportive of a friend while making some new acquaintances yourself.\n\nYou and your g/f may benefit from a discussion (when this has calmed down) about what she thinks is and is not acceptable, what you think is and is not acceptable, and see if you can come to an understanding or middle ground. However I would not want to spend any more time romantically with a partner who flips out every time I talk to a woman.", "NTA.\n\nI could never be with a possessive untrusting person... I generally think it's projection... people like that will cheat first because they can't really comprehend loyalty....  but whatever.\n\nYou were an open book about it.  Give me a break.\n\nYou two should set-up and negotiate ground rules for the future.", "NTA in my book, mainly because you were just looking to help out your friend. Now if you made a habit of drinking with random women, THEN I'd start to question it.\n\nHaving said that, we all have different limits. Your gf should have told you this was one of hers.\n\nYou two need to let this one go but communicate clear boundaries for future outings.", "NTA. Having drinks socially with a group that includes women is not disrespectful to your partner, particularly being that you were up front and honest with everyone in the situation and don't seem to have behaved inappropriately. It almost sounds to me like your gf's friend presented it as something scandalous and she now feels like she's in a weird situation and wants to blame you for it.", "NTA. You can't sheild yourself from women just because your gf is insecure.", "NTA. This is pretty ridiculous honestly. You weren't making out in a booth or flirting with them, you were socializing like a human. Either she has some serious jealousy/control issues or is hearing a different story from her friend. Either way, not good.", "NTA.\n\nYour GF seems a bit controlling.  What did she expect, you to just leave or ignore the other people?", "What is this? \"he asked if I would be fine with him leaving earlier than planned and I said yeah *so went home with one of the girls and I got a taxi back home.\"*. You went home with one of the girls and got a taxi from there? Why? Why would you go home with her? If I'm understanding this right, no wonder she's suspicious.", "NAH.\n\nI don't think its a matter of her not trusting you like other people are saying, but rather communication and the fact she had to find out from a friend before you told her. If you had shot her a text letting her know he was talking to a girl and she and her friends would be joining you, you did your part letting her know plans were changing.", "NTA just because you're in a relationship it doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to socialise with other people (regardless of their sex).", "NTA. All genders are allowed to socialise together. There\u2019s no cheating or other salacious conduct. Nothing you did was wrong.", "NTA - you were clear to the girls that you were in a relationship, you told your gf the next morning, and you left when your friend left so you weren't with the girls alone. I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA, brah. You just wanted to have a good time with your bro and it ain't none of your girl's business who you talk to on a night out. Girls can be friends too, jeez.", "NTA. Sounds like you were just having a good time and didn't do anything sketchy. Your gf needs to chill and trust you more, damn. Plus, why is her friend snitching on y'all? Live your life man.", ">I pointed out I'd done nothing wrong and if I was trying to hide something I wouldn't be telling her about it\n\nThis right here. NTA. You were honest with her and told her everything. You wouldn't be saying all this if you had something to hide. Your girlfriend is just being insecure for no reason. \n\n>I made sure the other women knew I was in a relationship when they joined us so they didn't get the wrong idea\n\nIf you mention this to her and she still said its wrong then something is wrong and its not you but her.", "So obviously NTA\n\nHow is your gf seriously mad at you for basically being the wingman to your friend? She should grow tf up.", "NTA. You really don\u2019t have anything to apologize for in my view.", "NTA, your gf is either so insecure she can\u2019t possibly imagine you interacting with the opposite sex. In which case she needs to deal with that herself. Or she\u2019s projecting her own cheating onto you. Her thought process is very unreasonable. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA, honestly this is a huge red flag. She sounds controlling and insecure.", "NTA, you were honest and didn't hide anything from your gf. if she cannot accept that then she doesn't trust you", "So... A general idea is that you guys should have a list of do's and don'ts and it sounds like whether you had this list or not, you did nothing wrong. You were upfront with the women that only your friend was up for dibs.\n\nWould it have been nice for her to hear it from you vs her friend? Yes. Was her friend in the wrong? Probably. Most likely. Especially if your gf is attacking you about drinking with other girls, she was probably told some \"other things\" OR she would have no self control and sleep with other men if the roles were reversed.\n\nEither way, you need to have a conversation to lay out ground rules because paragraph 2 is just wild speculation.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend is being really insecure.", "NTA\n\nHow are you supposed to be a wingman if you aren't allowed to be in the presence of a lady whilst drinking?", "NTA - You played wingman. You stayed in your lane, didn't overindulge, made sure they knew you were taken... the only thing else you might have considered was texting her during it to update her (and handling it like 'I'm playing wingman lol I'm being semi-social and have 3 different women gathered around (friend). Might get him a new gf by the end of the night!' Which would pretty much CYA on every aspect.", "NTA\n\n  \nYour gf is a conrolling AH.", "NTA: imagine the world if everyone once they were in a relationship they could no longer have fun, chat and laugh with their partners gender because it was disrespectful. Your gf is wild.", "If this was a thing you did every weekend I would understand her, but this is silly. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As for her, she lacks the trust.", "NTA... sounds like you have a jealous girl. I dated one like that, it's no fun.", "I think this sounds more like possession (and property arrangement)", "If someone hits me with that kind of jealousy as a ground rule, I won't be sticking around to find out what other whacky ideas they're hiding.", "My sentiments exactly", "Sorry if it wasn't clear but it was my friend who went home wtih one of the women so I just went home", "Oh please, you don't have to text your partner and say \"FYI, I\"m having friendly conversation with women\".  That is a ridiculous expectation.", "He literally told her the next morning.\n\nExpecting him to text her the instant he starts speaking to a woman is insane", "She did not have to find out from a friend, is the thing. OP told her about it the next morning.\n\nIf she is triggered by being told by her friends about this event before her bf even had the physical chance to do so, that is a toxic expectation on her part, enabled by her friends. \n\nI've read your threads, and while your advice would have averted this, it should not have been necessary in a healthy relationship. OP seems to be very open about his engagements with other women, and if that isn't enough, there's a problem on her end, IMO.", "Yeah, I mean wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with clubbing being a normal part of my husband\u2019s (or boyfriend\u2019s) routine hangouts. However if trying to cheer up friend and it happens once okay, however once friend is conversing primarily with some woman leaving BF to himself or other women I would think he would text his girlfriend saying friend found a gal and if I felt like hanging out and was free come on by. Otherwise it is odd to just hang with random women. At least in my relationship. My husband would agree with that too. We just respect each other that way. If other couples have different expectations then that is for them to decide, it seems that OP and GF are on different pages, so I would agree that NAH.", "Whew...that's good.", "Its not ridiculous at all. I would absolutely do that, not because my wife doesn't trust me, but to keep from the appearance of impropriety. Like OP said, gf found out from a friend.  That is 100% how rumors get started, and in a relationship, it is your job to take care of the relationship with your partner.", "It\u2019s just a piece of advice. As someone whose done it for years, it\u2019s just is a quick text and you can go back to having fun.\n\nAnd telling her the next morning didn\u2019t help that someone texted his gf that he was out with other women \ud83e\udd74. The whole point is to avoid the appearance of impropriety.", ">and she said she knows since a friend of hers messaged her to say I was drinking with other women.\n\nShe wasn't asking, the friend told her unprompted. \n\nIt's not toxic to want to know who your SO is out with. Like I've said before, to many stories start with trusting your SO WITHOUT protecting the relationship. There are countless \"I never thought my SO would do this to me\" stories because people trust their SO's judgment. How many of these people have thought \"Me and SO have a healthy relationship\"?", ">Yeah, I mean wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with clubbing being a normal part of my husband\u2019s (or boyfriend\u2019s) routine hangouts\n\nWhy not? If you trust your partner what's the problem?\n\n\" Otherwise it is odd to just hang with random women\" Except I was still with my friend. Do you never talk to other people when you go out?\n\n\"We just respect each other that way.\" What do you find disrespectful about your husband talking to a woman?", "So anytime you spoke with a woman of the opposite sex, you'd feel the need to text?  I mean, every relationship is different, and if that is what you need to do to keep the peace, you do you. \n\nBut like, what if you ran into an old female coworker and you guys were chatting?  You'd need to text about that?  Or a friends sister from growing up?  It just seems like a weird idea that you can't have a conversation with a woman without there being some kind of improriety there.", "Insecurity on your part is not anyone else's problem.\n\nYour expectation is faulty and should not be encouraged", "You can feel the way you feel, but it doesn\u2019t make other people wrong for feeling differently.\n\nMy husband has a limited amount of free time and would rather spend his time with me, so if his friend invited others into their gathering he would decide I am invited, it has nothing to do with trust and everything to do with who he would rather spend his time with, myself and my husband would rather spend time with each other than random people. \n\nAnd no, I don\u2019t generally speak to many other people when I go out. I am obviously in a different stage of my life than you though as your version of fun is going out clubbing. I just don\u2019t think your girlfriend is wrong for having feelings and I just think you may be incompatible because she doesn\u2019t feel secure in your relationship nor comfortable with your level of communication and you see no faults outside of hers.", "100%. Because I have a plan going out that night and my wife would know that plan. Any sort of deviation means I\u2019m shooting her a text because it\u2019s better for her to hear it from me rather than anyone else. Again that\u2019s how rumors get started. Also so many stories on Reddit of \u201cI never thought my spouse would cheat on me\u201d has led me er on the side of caution.", "Again it\u2019s just a piece of advice how I see it. If you disagree that\u2019s fine.", ">My husband has a limited amount of free time and would rather spend his time with me, so if his friend invited others into their gathering he would decide I am invited,\n\nI don't see how it is healthy to have no social life outside of your relationship and I feel bad for your husbands friends if they want to spend time with him tbh.", "But your plan doesn't necessarily mean you are only talking to the people you went with, right?  Like even if you made a plan to go out with Joe and John, does that imply that the entire night you will never talk to another person besides them, because otherwise you are \"deviating from the plan\"?", "Deviating looks like going out with one person and inviting 3 more people you do not know. It didn\u2019t just happen at one bar, but the 5 went to multiple bars together.", "Would you feel the need to do the same if say another friend group of guys joined?", "Personally id mention it just to keep from looking like I am keeping something from her. But the big part here is OP and friend didn\u2019t know these people before going out and bar hopping with them."]}
