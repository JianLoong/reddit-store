Encourage her to take college courses whether she gets married or not. Show her online options. Tell her that taking those courses will help her work in the business she plans to work in. And in the end, let her make her own decisions. Taking her against her will is only going to lead to her not doing anything you think she should be doing.", "YTA. Been the little sister in this situation. You couldn't have told me anything different. I learned the hard way after about a year and I grew so much from it. Let her make mistakes. College is always going to be there. It's NEVER too late.", "INFO - do you seriously think forcing a 17year old to live with you is going to work?", "YTA your sister is gonna have to figure out on her own. Can\u2019t force to go to college", "YTA.\n\nI get that you have *incredibly valid* concerns about your sister and her future plans, but you can\u2019t just kidnap her, force her to move in with you, and hold her hostage until she turns 18 or longer. *That\u2019s against the law and will IMPLODE any future relationship you have with her.*\n\nYou are not her parent or custodial guardian. You cannot reasonably expect her to willingly go along with your plan to control her life until she inevitably finds a way to flee. *You cannot make her life choices for her.* \n\nIf you follow through with your plan, all you\u2019re doing is telling your sister that you are *not*, under any circumstances, a safe person she can trust and turn to for help. Good luck coming back from that.", "Well, this is going to blow up in all your faces.  The harder all of you try to convince her she\u2019s making the wrong choices, the further she\u2019s going to go in an effort to prove you wrong.  But hauling her off to another town?  That\u2019s a whole different level.  The minute she turns 18, the boyfriend is likely to show up to rescue her from her gilded prison and there won\u2019t be a damn thing any of you can do about it.  And she\u2019s likely to cut all of you off as well.  The best you can hope for is that she keeps the lines of communication open.  \n\nBTW, there\u2019s an awesome site that shows just how much it can cost to be out on your own. Granted, it\u2019s geared for Texas, but it can be pretty instructive.

Honestly, have her read some of the REddit threads of wives stuck in a bad relationship but can't afford to get out on their own.  These stories break my heart.  Always good to be self-sufficient.  Gives you a lot more options in life.  \n\nMaybe invite her to come stay with you for a weekend and just spend some quality time with her.  It is important that if her decisions don't work out, she feels she can come to you and your parents for support and help.", "Coming from someone who has been down the road you're talking about, at some point \"tough love\" is letting them just do stuff until they realize they fucked everything up. Some folks figure out in thier 20s and some never do. I have a little sister that's still messing up her life and she's 25.

Don't be the dick.", "As well as you think your intentions are, this will not end well. Unfortunately all you can do is give the best advice possible, be there for her and let the cards fall where they may. Some people have to learn the hard way. Speaking from experience! You cannot force someone to do something that\u2019s not their idea.", "I was in a shitty relationship at 17 too. I got married at 20 and it became a DV situation.\n\nWhile you may not be able to do anything for your sister now in terms of trying to convince her out of this decision, I think making her live with you might not be best. \n\nIf I had a family member who stayed in touch and felt emotionally close to me throughout the relationship and all my poor decisions, it would have helped me so much. I might have even been able to leave/get out sooner. \n\nI think all you can really do is show your sister that you love her and respect her decisions and keep a close eye on her/keep in touch regularly if she decides to move with him. Make sure she feels like she can turn to you and trust you without feeling like you'll judge her or \"I told you so\" at her if she asks for help/changes her mind later. \n\nBest of luck. Your heart is in the right place.", "Hey Reddit would I be the asshole for kidnapping my teen sister, forcing her to do what I and my parents want over what she wants and not care about what she says she wants to do?

Personally, that would be my major concern because him moving her away from her support network with no way to leave... that is a very large concern,\n\nI think, before pulling that stunt, you need to invite your sister to stay with you for a couple of weeks this summer. Watch the dynamic in her calls with her boyfriend. Go from there.", "NTA But it won't work. She's already made up her mind and if her heart isn't into she will not apply herself in College. So you could implement your plan but she doesn't have to cooperate. The only that can make her change is life hitting her in the face that it could a bad to a terrible outcome. The only solution is for her to make these decisions herself.", "Technically, YTA.  But you'd 100% be doing the right thing for her.", "NTA\n\nI think sometimes if we see a train wreck coming, it\u2019s our responsibility to help out. HOW you do it though is up to you.\n\nWhether that\u2019s through persuasion or abduction is really your call", "NTA\nBut I doubt it will work for several reasons. First of all, unless you have legal guardianship of her, you won\u2019t be able to enroll her in school, consent to medical care for her, etc. Second of all, you can\u2019t force someone who doesn\u2019t want to go to college to go. And even if you could, they might drop out, flunk out, etc. Third, 17 year-olds can be strong willed. She may run away. Unless you have legal guardianship, she may try to have you charged with false imprisonment. Tricking her could damage your relationship with her for years to come.\nIt sounds like your parents have not prepared her well for adulthood. They have not seen to it that she knows the value of having a job. They have not made sure she knows how to drive. What other life skills have they failed to help her acquire? \nI think the best thing you can do is listen-really listen-to her without judgment. Then gently give her some advice and tell her your concerns. Help build up her self-awareness and self-confidence. Support her decisions unless they are truly destructive. Let her know you love her unconditionally and that you will always be there for her.", "I've read some of your comments. She's got her head in the clouds. A year or two of working as a maid in a lodge, and she may call you for an escape route. You might want to be that open door for her. If you try to abduct her and force her to move without her boyfriend, it will blow up in your face. She'll leave you, go to him and no longer trust you at all. You'll lose the chance to influence her life in the future, when she figures out that getting away from parents is not some magical solution. If you really want to be supportive, make sure she has some way of doing long-term birth control--an IUD, maybe? Because if she gets pregnant so young, she really will be stuck with a future she can't afford. Her boyfriend, and his lies and failure to graduate doesn't sound like a great potential wage earner, either. She's going to need your wisdom and support in the future. Keep the lines of communication open, so she'll feel like she can get your help when she's ready.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
