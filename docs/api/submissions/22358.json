You asked to take the time off and were told no. What do they expect you to do?", "No. You\u2019re 25 and have your own life now. Your parents need to start realising that.", "NTA for them planning everything before you could confirm you are able to attend on those dates.  I am sorry they didn't give you enough time to properly plan, and are blaming you for them being inconsiderate.", "Your family are the AH. This has happened to me a lot in my life with my family. It\u2019s one of the reasons I don\u2019t talk to my parents anymore.", "NTA your family created this situation by not waiting until you had leave approved from your work but are now making you feel guilty. That makes no sense. Do they often create problems and then blame others for them?", "NTA. Interesting how you're at fault for not being to go because of work but they can't change the dates because... other people can't get off from work.", "Sorry, OP, you're definitely NTA but your family is being really crappy about this. You wanted to go, your school won't let you take their dates off... Do they expect you to risk your job for a fun activity that they should have waited a few more weeks to schedule?\n\nHopefully they're just being jerky about this because they know they jumped the gun and are being defensive, but it still sucks that not only can you not join them on something you were excited about, but they're also treating you poorly for not being able to go.", "NTA, your fam is being dicks", "NTA\n\nWhat are you supposed to do, miss work? What are they thinking?", "How could you possibly be an AH for not being able to get off work? You have no choice", "NTA. It's almost impossible to take the last few days of the semester off as a teacher. There are final projects, final grades, final exams, final parties, etc. For a vacation instead of an emergency? Your family is just being inconsiderate.", "NTA. If you hav3 to work, you have to work. Will these people pay your way in the world when you don\u2019t hav3 a job?", "NTA with flying colors. \n\nYou\u2019re a teacher and you requested the time off, which was denied. Do they have no respect for your career? And you communicated that you would need to wait & see! It's not your fault that they didn't wait or consider your schedule before making their plans. I truly do not understand why they are giving you such a hard time.\n\nThe only thing I can maybe think of, is that your dad just entirely misunderstood and that version of events was relayed to your family? Just because the comment he made about you not wanting to go. I don\u2019t know though, everyone here is being hella unreasonable.", "So NTA your job takes priority", "NTA your family is trash and clearly didn't consider your needs. Sucks.", "NTA. What a bunch of first character people in your family.", "NTA It's hard to get vacation time off as a teacher. It's assumed teachers will vacation around the school schedule. You don't even get vacation days.", "Definitely NTA. Your family needs to get over the fact it's beyond your control and your hands are tied.", "NAH sometimes dates and plans don't pan out. They are AH if they hold it against you and YTA if you hold it against them. Life happens and sometimes we can't all be apart of things. I am sure you will find something else to do and be able to attend another trip with them another time.", "INFO: curious what do your family members do for work? Especially the ones who couldn\u2019t wait that long to request the time off?\n\nAnd also, could you not have requested time off before the school dates were announced?\n\nGenerally leaning NTA but want to understand more context", "NAH - Teacher here. I get it.  Our holidays are set in stone, and we have no control over them.  But Disney Christmas is kind of one of those awesome things that people like.  Also, it probably won't be sweltering hot like it will be by the time your spring break comes along (I'm assuming this is Florida).   \n\nMy family went to Disney in the fall one year and I couldn't go. I was sad, so they ended up going again with me in July. Not recommended.  Disney in July is brutal, but I can tell you that March or April will not be much better.  I've done Universal during my spring break in both March and April in different years, and it was very hot.\n\n** If you are not talking about Disney World in Florida, ignore everything except the NAH/Disney Christmas part. I know it stinks, but maybe next time, they will be able to go at a time that works with your schedule.**", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is a bit crazy. Yes I know some school districts do more time before Christmas so less time after New Year's but still...", "Agreed. OP is NTA! I'm sure she would love nothing more than to join them, particularly given she has fond memories of going throughout her youth!  \n\nHowever, key word to this whole debacle is: family! Family should talk to each other and ensure everyone is on the same page. Now, if things change at the last minute that cannot be avoided after plans are made, disappointed, not anger is the correct emotion. OP is an adult with adult responsibilities. Family is an AH!", "It doesn't sound like she's holding it against them. She posting because her family is holding it against her. Her dads comments prove that", "Where I live, teachers get 3 personal days to use in the school year. The idea is that since we have school breaks, we should schedule our holidays then. Which is what OP wanted her family to do... Teachers can't request time off (unless for an actual illness/emergency) right before the end of term, either.", "But that's not the point? The point is her family is giving her shit for not going and getting time off, plus they knew they needed to check the dates, but didn't and then complained when it didn't work out.", "But are they? I mean, it sounded like in the post her dad was sad that she couldn't go, but when she got upset and said that her work wouldn't let her off, he was just like \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nAs for tickets, the closer you get to Christmas, the harder it is to get tickets and a place to stay.  I really do feel bad for her, but her whole family doesn't have to stop their plans just because her job doesn't allow it. If you want to go to Disney Christmas, you go when you can."]}
