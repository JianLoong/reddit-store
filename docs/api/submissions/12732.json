My daughter came home from school a few times with lice,I was so upset mostly towards whoever kids who had the lice parents cuz why are you bringing your kids to school with a head full of lice spreading it to other kids, (maybe they didn\u2019t know but the signs are usually obvious by scratching a lot) anyways it\u2019s good to let the teacher know. Also try putting baby oil in her hair and comb it with that lice comb, another trick is using apple cider vinegar, put it in her hair and wrap it with a plastic bag for about an hr and you will see they all start dying. What I would do is put the ACV, tree tea oil (that stuff helps too) and lice shampoo and wrap it with a plastic grocery bag for a while then take off the bag and put baby oil and start combing her hair in small sections, you might want to do this outside so you can see them better because the eggs are attached to the hair and don\u2019t easily come off , then rinse it all off and use the lice comb again. Do this everyday for few days. Then keep checking her hair for about a week straight once you don\u2019t see them anymore because the eggs take a couple days to hatch so you want to be sure nothing hatching and creating more lice.", "NTA - the school should have a better communication plan for sure, because if people don't know it's going around then they won't treat for it, and community treatment is the only way to stop infestations lasting for months.\n\nThat being said, there's a lot of hysteria about lice. Quick facts:\n\n- Head lice don't jump or fly, they're slow movers and they don't like to leave a head once they're on it so the only way for them to transfer is head-to-head contact or contact with recently fallen hair from an infested head\n\n- Head lice only survive for a day or so if they're off a person's head, they starve otherwise\n\n- Lice eggs only mature and hatch in the warmth of a person's head, so they become unviable in a day or so once off the head\n\n- Eggs take about a week to hatch\n\n- Lice take about a week to mature enough to start laying eggs\n\nThe recommended, low stress treatment method is:\n\n- Get a lice shampoo. Treat your kid's hair. While treating, use the comb to make sure the shampoo is killing the adult lice - if it is, that's all you need: very few shampoos can do much to the eggs. Don't bother combing every single egg out, it's way too much stress and you'll probably miss some anyway. Wash hair as normal to get rid of all the corpses.\n\n- Wait a week (by this time, all the leftover eggs will have hatched, but none/few of these hatched lice will be grown enough to be laying more eggs) then treat again. Comb while treating to see if you're still killing them.\n\n- That's it. A third treatment a week later would catch any weird outliers.\n\n\nTo stop reinfestations, change bedding, headgear and anything else your kid might have been rubbing their head on. You don't need to burn them or even wash them hot: just keep them away from any heads for a week and all the eggs and lice will die.\n\nStopping reinfestations from school is harder, you mostly just tell the kids to keep their heads to themselves and hope. Don't share hats or coats, don't wrestle, keep your head off the carpet during mat time. Three rounds of shampoo treatment should catch most reinfestations though, and hopefully the rest of the families affected are doing the same thing.", "I just want to clarify something\u2014 the first go, did you just pick the lice out and not treat? Did you wash all bedding, etc?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t actually treat for them, YTA. They would come back as adult lice would\u2019ve laid eggs and contributed to them returning. Treating with shampoo/products, you still have to come back and retreat.", "You're quite adamant that you and your family don't have them, but when you found them in your daughter's hair the first time, there were several. I hate to be the beater of bad news, but you and/or the members of your household most likely DO have them too. \n\nAs far as laundering the sheets and pillowcases, it's a good start, but nowhere near enough. ALL linens, including comforters, duvets, pillows, bedskirts; basically anything fabric on the bed needs to be washed and essentially cooked in the dryer. Same with stuffed or plush toys. Mattresses need to be vacuumed and preferably sprayed. Carpets and area rugs vacuumed and sprayed. If dirty laundry hampers are kept in the closet you're best to launder all the clothing in the closet, clean or not. And this is not limited to her bedroom, this will apply to all bedrooms, and in fact, the whole house. You just have to miss one of those little suckered and BOOM, reinfested. Been there, done that, not fun.\n\nAs a preventative,  add a couple of drops of tea tree oil to the family shampoo and conditioner bottles, it's a repellant.\n\nAnd please remember, lice has nothing to do with hygiene, and is not a reflection of you or your family's cleanliness.", "They don\u2019t like color treated hair, nits won\u2019t stick.    That\u2019s why kids get them so bad.  They have virgin hair.", "My younger sister got lice from using a set of library earphones once, and they'd spread to all of us (6 people, three of them kids) before we even realized she had them. It took months to get rid of them. Don't waste money on lice shampoo or sprays. We tried about three different brands and none of them worked. The only things that worked for us were consistent daily lice combing + nit picking and linen changes.\n\nNTA. Unfortunately, I'm not sure going to the principal will make much difference. In my area, at least, schools are doing away with lice notifications or in-school checks altogether because they're just a \"nuisance\" and it's embarrassing for the kids. On the one hand I get it, but on the other - they're a huge inconvenience, especially for large or poor families.", "NTA. \n\nI used to sit next to a girl with long hair at school. Her parents used to neglect her, and I often ended up with lice on my hair because of her. I have curly hair, and it was bloody painful for me (and my mom who had to manage my hair). Please contact whoever\u2019s above that teacher and make sure your daughter doesn\u2019t suffer because of another parent\u2019s negligence.", "Nta. I hate it but the school wouldn\u2019t do anything when my kid kept getting lice either so they wouldn\u2019t make anyone feel bad.", "Yes. I have read about this too. So my vacation week will be doing all these. \ud83d\ude41 I am waiting for her next reply.", "Yes all of this! It sucks but you have to wash all of the bedding", "OmG. That\u2019s what I\u2019m terrified of. I have curly hair so it would be harder for me unlike them. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have lice specialist here. I\u2019d have to remove them one by one. Now, I am kinda paranoid that I have one already.", "I guess if we all just shave our heads, we wouldn't have to deal with lice anymore!", "We had to do that, too. Me, my oldest, and the (at the time) 1 year old. Multiple trips because the school did nothing to make sure no other kids had lice.", "In the US, the guidance is not to restrict attendance for people dealing with lice. Notices are sent but the social stigma and duration of an infestation causing learning loss results in kids coming to school actively dealing with it. Lice treatment needs to be done at least twice, once to kill live lice then again in a certain number of days to take out the newly hatched lice. Combing is supposed to be done repeatedly on top of the treatments.", "It's not normal, you're not wrong. I've been a teacher for some years ranging from infants to seniors in high school. I never once had any issues with lice.", "To add: if a medicated lice shampoo is not available or too expensive, you can substitute that step with a suffocation method.\n\nWhich is:\n\n- Cover your kid's hair with some kind of goo: regular cheap conditioner, mayonnaise, whatever skin-safe goo you like. And I mean COVER, you're looking to trap and suffocate all the adult lice. Wrap it in a towel and leave it for half an hour, then comb it out and make sure you see dead adult lice. Wash hair as normal afterwards.", "I did. I have read about them. And since I only have top load washing machine, I had them laundered with hot water.", "Idk, I struggled with lice in middle school. I had long thick hair and my mom spent hours combing and treating it. We tried medication, old wives tales, just about anything we could. Still had them on and off for like a damn year. I think it might have been the bedding or stuffed animals, honestly. \n\nHowever, not a single member of my family ever contracted them. It\u2019s not a given. Don\u2019t share bedding, don\u2019t share hair tools.", "Will you keep us updated? I'm also really hoping the principal sides with you. I'm a teacher, and the thought of just brushing it off is tight fifty shades of ew.\n\nEdit, verdict NTA, not even close.", "I'm not sure about how the school system is set where you're at but going to the teacher likely isn't the best approach. I would recommend going to the school nurse or equivalent of such as the bugs are a health concern not a teaching concern. If there is an epidemic of any sort of bugs it likely means checking all of the students as well as more through cleaning of the school.", "call the school nurse and speak to her. she will conduct head checks for the class", "My darter has coarse black curly hair. I have wavy hair.  Super mixed black and Filipino, when I went through this, it took me to day 3 to just decide to take her to get it done. I ended up with lice. I had to throw everything in the drier in plastic bags then wash and then dry. Depriving them of oxygen helps to kill. But it sucked. I really recommend seeing a specialist. Even for your own peace of mind.", "I hate to say it, but chances are you do have it. By the time you see the lice, there\u2019s an infestation. Lice is NOT fun.  \n\nWash all the bedding on high, comforters blankets pillow cases sheets. Take all stuffed animals and bag them up somewhere like the garage for several weeks. Shampoo & lice comb several times. I got lice a lot as a kid and vividly remember going through the treatments several times. My family was a clean family n all that, some kids (like me lol) are just unlucky.", "The last two times i got it, the lice comb helped me a lot. It just took some weeks before I got rid of them. The last times happened as an adult, so I've no idea how I got them.", "Lice tend not to like curly hair. But sometimes you can find sprays and stuff for your hair ment to deter lice. Might be worth purchasing for everyone in your family.", "Please don\u2019t do that \ud83d\ude05 it\u2019s a costly procedure, might be cheaper now, but just get quotes from places around you and see.", "Sorry, you did to which of the questions?", "My daughter brought it home from MILs house (20 years ago) No shared bedding, no shared hair tools. Spent the weekend with grandma and came home with it. Sitting/lounging on the same fabric couch, hanging sweaters in the same coat tree etc.\nDaughter came home and shared it with most of the family the same way. Again, no shared bedding or hair tools. Coats hung together in the closet, kids on the couches, wrestling on the carpet and so on. Heck, even the 6 month old baby had it! Yet 2 of the 3 adults didn't get it, one being myself, ironically, the only one who ever did share a bed or snuggle up and fall asleep with the kids.\nLice are funny that way.", "school nurse not the principal. school nurse will take it seriously", "When my daughter was younger, I used to add a few drops of tea tree oil to the bottle of detangling spray. She has cousins who's mum doesn't believe in nits (?) and this stuff really worked, she never had anymore after I started using it.", "Exactly! It\u2019s not a definite that your family will or won\u2019t get it. Fricking lice man. Just such a pain for everyone."]}
