You knew that she brings her dog with her, and you asked her specifically to go out and run an errand for you. Since you surely didn't expect her to bring a Great Dane into a grocery store, that means that you essentially asked her to leave the dog unattended in the yard. So, you created the set up. The fact that you're asking your babysitter to run shopping errands, which is not typically part of a babysitter's job, is a secondary issue making you an AH. \n\nThen, your son, who also presumably knows the dog is present, left the door open for him to get in. She's exactly right, he is most directly responsible for the dog being in the house.   \n\n\nEssentially, you and your son are the ones responsible for this, not her. You could have asked her not to bring the dog along if it bothered you, and found another sitter if that was a deal breaker. You chose not to do that. \n\nYou and your son are responsible for this situation.", "So you want to fire her for something your son did in which you refuse to assign any responsibility to your son? And you\u2019re mad she \u201cblamed\u201d him? Yeah, come on, YTA.", "Unfortunately, YTA for blaming the nanny. It sounds like the nanny had permission to put the dog in your yard. \n\nThe dog didn't get inside because of her, but because of your son leaving the door open. While it's an honest mistake on his part, that's not her fault.\n\nIt is your choice as to whether or not you want to keep employing her, but it is wrong to blame her for your son leaving the door open.", "YWBTA, yes. You stated at the beginning that her dog coming around has been annoying but tolerable for the *4 years* she\u2019s been babysitting for you, without incident.\n\nThis was an unfortunate event, for which your son is largely to blame. She even offered to pay for any damages/eaten food, I\u2019m really confused what your desire is here with regard to the respect and accountability you claim is missing.", "YTA\n\nYour sons negligence let the dog in. The sitter is innocent.", "\n\n>I don\u2019t know whether I should be upset at my son\n\nThen YTA. How many times in the last four years did this happen? Why couldn\u2019t you grab the milk and bread yourself, or pay for a delivery service to do it? Why is your son not held accountable in any of this?", "YTA. She was abiding by the agreement you had made: leave the dog outside. If it weren't for your son, this would not have happened. Blame the person who let this happen: your son.", "YTA -It is your son's fault, not your babysitters', that the dog got into the house. Then there's the general wisdom that people who don't like dogs shouldn't be trusted.", "YTA. By allowing her to bring the dog everyday, you have to accept that things happen even with the most well trained dogs. She left the dog outside. It was your irresponsible son who allowed the dog to get inside. She didn\u2019t push off responsibility either, your son did it and She said she\u2019d pay for cleaning and make more food. What else do you want her to do?? She\u2019s been with your kids for 4 years so are you really going to fire her over something so stupid that she\u2019s willing to fix?", "YTA\n\nYou want to punish her for your son\u2019s negligence. She offered to pay for cleaning and to buy/ remake the food. Accidents happen. If you have a loyal trusted caretaker for your children I would be grateful. You are acting anything but.", "YWBTA, and have already been TA.\n\nWhat exactly was the nanny supposed to do differently? You know she brought the dog over, as, I would imagine, did your son. She left the dog in the yard and went to the store, at your request.\n\nYou say \"**s**he basically blamed it on my son\" like that's wrong. IT WAS YOUR SON'S FAULT. Nonetheless, the nanny, who certainly has much less money to spare than you, offered to pay for the cleaning. What else was she supposed to do? Grovel? Ritually strangle the dog in your presence?\n\nShe has done more than she needed to in response to damage caused by your son's negligence. You. Would. Be. The. Asshole. to fire her, and should apologize to her profusely for the way you have already treated her.", "Ywbta.  \n\nIt was all your sons fault.  \n\nAnd she is willing to pay for everything damaged.", "The nanny quite responsibly left her dog in the yard as usual. She's not responsible for your son letting the dog into the house. That's what closing a door (garage or people sized) will do, after all; prevent ingress. \n\nHow about you get your son to take accountability and contribute to the reparations? The nanny has already offered more than you deserve. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Can you explain to me what she could have done differently to prevent this? I can\u2019t think of anything since she left the dog where it should be, and then your son accidentally let him in when she was gone doing something you\u2019d asked her to do. It\u2019s simply not her fault and you blaming her is entirely unfounded.", "YTA. Your SON let the dog in.", "YTA. She needs to take accountability, no your son does. He left the door open while she was on a grocery run with the kids (something not all baby sitters would do). You want to fire your lifesaver, okay. I'm sure people will be lining up to hire her.\n\nAnd your son can be the new nanny, won't that be fun.", "YTA, its 100% your sons fault to begin with. He is the one that wasn't paying attention to his surroundings and left the door open. She was responsible and kept the dog outside. The entire situation would never have happened if your son had closed the door. Then she was offering to pay for cleaning and remake the food which is pretty nice of her to begin with since it wasn't even her fault. Especially since you knew the dog would be there and have been in the know for 4 years.", "YWBTA. It was your son's fault, I don't know why you're getting pissed at the babysitter. She didn't leave access to the house open for the dog. It's not like she brought the dog without your agreement, and she didn't break the agreed conditions for the dog to be there. She's offered to make it right even though it wasn't her fault, what more do you want?", "Your son left the door open. YTA", "YTA, she blamed your son because it WAS his fault. She left the dog in the backyard to run an errand for you. The dog was secure and outside, and she had every reason to believe he would remain there. She\u2019s being very nice to offer to pay for the cleaning and food. If you don\u2019t want the dog at your house, you should have established that boundary long ago.", "YTA\n\nYour son let the dog into the house, not the nanny.\n\nIf you had an issue with the dog being there at all, why the hell didn't you say that FOUR YEARS AGO?", "Yeah, YWBTA. She left the dog in a safe place. Your son was the person who left the house insecure and let the dog access the house while he went for a shower. Don't fire the babysitter for something that was another person's fault.", "YTA-She offered to correct the situation, and you could have simply told her not to bring the dog in the future, not to mention your son left the door open which caused the situation to occur.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable for you to decide that you do not want her dog to come with her (especially if the dog destroys  the yard) and switch babysitters in the future if it's an issue.\n\nPersonally, I think you should be more upset your son left the door open, and your house could have been targeted by burglars or worse. \n\nFor example, what if your son leaves the door open, and one of the your little ones got outside and got hit by a car? These things can happen in the blink of an eye, and you should be able to calmly explain to a 17-year old to always double-check the doors are closed.", "YTA. It's 100% your son's fault. The nanny left the dog outside as you had agreed while doing an errand *at your own request*.  Your son carelessly let the dog in. Nanny was not there to prevent this since she was performing a task *at your direct request*. If YOU had not asked her to leave the premises, the incident would not have happened. So if you don't want to rightfully blame your son who actually let the dog get in, you should blame yourself for setting up a situation where the unattended dog was able to enter. While you're at it, you might take a minute to be glad it was just a dog and not a person bent on theft or malfeasance that got inside.\n\nNanny offered to pay for cleaning and to remake the stolen food at her own expense even though it's not her fault the dog got in. She's taking responsibility for the damage her dog did through no fault of her own. That's pretty upstanding.\n\nIf **I** was the nanny, you wouldn't have to fire me, I'd quit. You're being unreasonable and dramatic with your \"she doesn't respect me enough and take accountability.\" and I wouldn't tolerate that.", "YTA, while yes, the dog should be better trained, it\u2019s not her fault that the dog destroyed stuff when it was your son who let him in. She put him outside to try and prevent any damage and she can\u2019t be responsible for something that happened when she wasn\u2019t even there. You should bring it up with your son as he is the one who let the dog in. If you really have a problem with her \u201cblaming\u201d your son when she had no control of what was happening at the house, maybe it would be better for her to find a better person to babysit for.", "\u201cMy eldest, 17, is in and out of the house on weekdays     since he's a university student with a variable timetable. I don't really employ her to look after him since he's pretty self-sufficient.\u201d\n\n\nThis was the first of several red flags.

YOUR SON!!!\n\nIf I was the babysitter, I'd quit over this.\n\nOh, in case I forgot to mention.\n\nYou're an asshole.", "\"*I was not satisfied with this response, since she basically blamed it on my son*.\" ... seriously? It was your son's fault. And you let her bring the dog. Stop blaming her. YTA", "If you're gonna be concerned about something happening once in four years, I feel like you should be more concerned that your son is leaving doors open so that just anyone could walk in. Even nice neighborhoods have package stealers. I wouldn't put it last then to walk in an open door and make off with what they can", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s had her dog with her when she babysits for you for a long time. Your son left the door open. Blame him.", "YTA and it is completely your son's fault. \n\nYou have a nanny you can trust and if you think you can do better you're going to have a hell of a time finding someone. There's a reason she's been a lifesaver, you don't have a lot of good options.", "YTA big time. It was your sons fault 100% and she was doing you a favor by going to the store.", "You don't like her. Just get a new nanny instead of torturing her and blaming her for something that is your sons fault. He doesn't fart rainbows, mistakes happen. You have kids. YTA", "YTA dogs are dogs don\u2019t be a spazz it\u2019s just a little pee. Your son is 100% at fault. You allowed the dog over during her time there that\u2019s on you so YES you would be a major AH if you fired her for that.", "YTA.  I have no idea how this is not your son's fault.  He came in through the garage and that's how the dog entered the house, no?\n\nAnyways.  NTA for firing her because a good and reliable babysitter who is willing to do chores seems like they would always be in demand.  Dog or no dog.", "I've had some bosses who might bring a dog to the office for their job, but those bosses were the owners of the business so really who's going to tell them no? Also those were some of the sweetest dogs I've been around, and never very large.\n\nThat said, who the hell brings the canine equivalent of a horse to a CLIENT'S PROPERTY?", "ESH. Why does she have the dog in the first place? I have never heard of someone bringing their dog to a job before. Plus, if that's the kind of damage it does, it doesn't sound safe to have around children (before people come at me, I have dogs, I love dogs, but this SPECIFIC dog sounds untrained). Unless it's a service dog, I don't understand why she's bringing it to work in the first place.\n\nThat said. YTA too. You gave her consent to have the dog there and accidents happen.  It's not fair to fire her over one mistake.\n\nHowever, if the dog is something you are no longer comfortable with, then it is best to explain that to her. Either she can leave the dog at her place or you don't think you can work with her anymore. Your house, your rules, and most importantly your CHILDREN. Your needs come before her job. She is an employee and you are a boss. No matter what other people think, this is YOUR call to make.", "NTA.  \nWhy does she need to bring her dog anyway?

Far easier than having the babysitter go while also herding toddlers.", "The babysitter has been bringing the dog there for four years without incident. OP had ample opportunity to change the arrangement if they really wanted to. They are blaming the babysitter for the son\u2019s mistake.", "She had the OP\u2019s permission.  The problem isn\u2019t the size of the dog; the problem is the son leaving the door open.  What is the logic for blaming the sitter?", "Irrelevant. She was in the habit of bringing the dog and clearly had leave to do so.", "If OP had an issue with the dog being there, she's had YEARS to say so.", "Because it's not physically and socially healthy for the dog to leave it home in a crate.", "No, I don't think that's the same. In that case, since the dog is expected to be indoors most of the time, it's reasonable to expect it to be trained out of behaviors like chewing, and that responsibility falls on the owner, rather than expecting everyone to adjust permanently to a poorly trained animal. I haven't seen the post you're referring to, but if the dog were a puppy in the process of training, and the roommate was careless, I would say they had the blame. If the dog were an adult and had simply not been trained for its primary environment, then I would blame the owner. Depending on whether the owner had the opportunity to move the shoes and chose to simply warn the roommate, I might even say that the owner was to blame regardless.   \n\n\nIn this case, the dog's primary environment is outside, and usually away from the employer's house. The only reason it was indoors was because the teenage son was careless. The only reason the owner wasn't present to actively monitor the dog is that the employer asked the owner to absent herself to run errands on her behalf. So, in this case, the employer has deliberately removed the ability of the babysitter to monitor her animal (in the full knowledge that the animal was present), and her son, again with full knowledge that the animal was present, failed to secure the garage door, which would be negligent regardless of whether the dog was present.   \n\n\nSo no, I don't think the two situations are the same, and in the OP's case I don't blame the dog owner.", "The couch wasn\u2019t ruined and the babysitter offers to replace the ruined food.

Had a roommate before who talked about getting a dog, but was talked out of it because they liked to travel regularly which would have left the dog home far too often to best care for the dog's needs. \n\nIf someone's going to have a pet, they need to make sure they can provide the needs of the pet. Apparently to some that means \"bring pet with you anywhere you go for longer periods of time regardless of how it might affect your job (tearing up a client's yard regularly for the duration of your job).\" \n\nYes, it was known. It was allowed.

But THIS employee did ask, and THIS employer said yes, and it was an arrangement that persisted for years. Was it perfect from the employer's perspective? No. But she liked the employee otherwise - she was a \"lifesaver\", and clearly the kids liked her.\n\nThen something happened that was NOT the employee's fault, and the dog did some damage (fairly minor damage, btw - the dog did not \"trash the employers house\" as she dramatically titled her post).\n\nThe question is, in that context, would the employer be an asshole for firing the employee. The answer is certainly yes. Can she still do so? Sure. Employment is at will, you can fire someone for almost any reason, or no reason at all.
