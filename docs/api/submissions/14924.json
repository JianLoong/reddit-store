We have been together since we were 19. I have known his family almost the whole length of that and generally we are close. The exception is his sister Katherine. She has this thing against my name and whenever she wants to give an example of a terrible name, she uses my name Wren as the example. First time it happened my husband and I were still only dating, it was a few months into our relationship and Katherine was expecting her first baby and over dinner blurted out while she and her husband were debating names that she was open to a lot as long as the name was not dumb like Wren. My husband and his parents called her out. She dismissed them.\n\nThen after her oldest child arrived and he had no name, because she and her husband could not agree and they were arguing over it and she said she didn't want her child to have a stupid non-name like Wren. My husband (still boyfriend then) told her that she could find a different name to use but he would not let her keep disrespecting my name like that. She told him that I would surely agree with her and I chimed in and said actually, I always loved my name. She was speechless and said fine, but she wanted a normal name, not something \"cooler\" or \"edgier\" or \"different\" and my husband was like, that's not for us to decide but Wren doesn't need to come into it.\n\nShe did get better at it but she does still do it on occasion and I have noticed only when my husband is not around. I know she doesn't like our child's name, which is fine, she doesn't ever say anything. But Wren is still always used as her example of a terrible name, or a name that should never be used. She simply doesn't talk about it as much.\n\nThen last Saturday we were at my husband's parents house. I was with my child and Katherine was trying to settle her two younger kids. Another family member came in, someone I don't know so well, and they were talking and the family member was asking for advice on naming the baby she was expecting and Katherine yet again used Wren as an example of a terrible name. Only this time she went a little harder on her hate for the name and she said it was ridiculous, a non name and parents should have their kids taken away for ruining their kids. I stepped in and told her she hates my name, I get it, but she needs to stop using my name as her example for bad names every time. That I still love my name and do not want to hear her diss it, and that I did not want to hear her diss my parents by saying something like she just had. The cousin was shocked that Katherine did that and left. Katherine told me I could not police her thoughts or words and I was being incredibly entitled telling her what she can and cannot say. My husband heard her yelling and came in and said we should leave. He told Katherine she went too far. She still says I was the one who way overstepped.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681633255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12o0zre/aita_for_telling_my_sister_inlaw_to_stop_using_my/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Much nicer than Katherine. \ud83d\ude01", "Love your husband for defending you so hard usually in these stories the partner is a doorknob. NTA the sister is a villain. A wretch.

I understand why that makes you feel bad. I have never heard the name wren before, i Think it is a pretty unique and nice name. Wear it with pride! \n\nShe sounds like she holds a bigger grudge against you. No normal person would actively insult someone openly While they hear it like that. It sounds really disrespectful and the fact that you have kept it cool for so Long is quite impressive - But let Me tell you, there is no reason what-so-ever she should be allowed to use you like a doormat like that. For your own sake you should push back hard and immidietly when she does it again. Also have your husband help you out. It sounds like he needs to step up as Well. \n\nNTA!", "NTA of course. She\u2019s rude and looking for every opportunity to insult you. Buy her a wren- themed ornament or picture to remind her if you next Xmas - if you\u2019re still bothering to be in touch with her", "NTA Wren is a lovely name!\n\nYour SIL has issues, and rudeness is just one of them. Start referring to her as Common Kathy and see how she likes it.\n\nShe is disrespecting you as well as your name, she is an AH", "NTA. Completely. Your SIL seems mean and vindictive. Wren is a lovely name and if Katherine googled it, she would know it\u2019s a songbird. \n\nI think some non contact with your SIL would be good for your mental health.", "NTA obviously but - what?! She openly in front of you multiple times has said she doesn\u2019t want a stupid name like\u2026your name? Is she blatantly oblivious to any other social etiquette?", "NTA. Sometimes reading posts like yours and seeing how some of you handle your situations makes me feel low key uncivilized because I would have absolutely NOT been nice the second time around and I\u2019d probably strike the fear of God in that sweet ole brazen Katherine. There would absolutely not be a third offense. \nI think you handled yourself well\u2014 kindly, even. You\u2019re certainly owed an apology because Wren is a great name.", "NTA. Katherine disrespected you numerous times and she took it too far when she said parents should lose their rights for choosing that name. \n\nIt could have started off as her being jealous and dissing your name to make herself feel better about herself to her being bitter and angry that your husband and in-laws defended you. \n\nIf it were me, I would tell my husband that I will not be around Katherine unless she apologizes and doesn\u2019t disrespect me again.", "NTA, that is incredibly rude and she owes you more than an apology.  She should be ashamed of herself - I wonder if she is secretly jealous of you or something.       Maybe she\u2019s jealous her parents like you so much.\n\nI\u2019d just distance myself from her if she didn\u2019t apologise and stop.", "NTA\n\nWow, is your SIL dreadful.\n\nThis woman has **repeatedly** disrespected your name and been told not to. She's doing it because she is trying to humiliate you and prove herself superior. I would limit contact and if asked why just inform her that you hate the way her name sounds and that it causes you distress. Keep repeating it until she gets the point.", "NTA. That's incredibly rude, and foolish of her. You never insult names off the bat, in case the people you're talking to like them/have them. Just say you don't care for them If You Must. \n\nIts also laughable that she tried to tell you that you weren't allowed, to say she wasn't allow, to say things. Sorry girl, but have stupid opinions get called stupid.", "NTA. She\u2019s the one who is rude, a bully and disrespectful. Glad to hear your husband puts his for down, her behaviour is really unacceptable.", "NTA.\n\nHer behavior is petty, immature, and kind of disturbing given that she's a parent. \n\nHer children are going to inevitably absorb some of her senseless toxic mentality/behavior.\n\nSounds like a weird wench. \n\nAnyhow, it's hard enough to understand ourselves; ain't no one got time to figure out why McKaren does what she does.", "NTA, she either has no manners or social intelligence", "NTA.\n\nAnd not that it matters, because there is no excuse to be so rude, but Wren is a beautiful name and I\u2019ve always thought it was popular way back when and is making a comeback.", "NTA.\nStop trying to convince her to see sense. \nInstead, look that cowbag dead in the eyes and say \"This again, Katherine? Change the tune, love.

I am someone who loves my name too, it's nothing special, but i love it.", "NTA. Katherine doesn\u2019t like your name. She feels it\u2019s terrible. That\u2019s an aesthetic position that we don\u2019t have to diagnose any further than to notice that you like your name, and thus her position is subjective, neither true nor false. That\u2019s okay. \n\nHer insistence that your name is a \u201cnon-name\u201d is interesting, and I\u2019m curious what other names she thinks are \u201cnon-names\u201d. I have my suspicions that an analysis of those wild quickly reveal her to believe that \u201cnames that don\u2019t come from these 5 traditional sources\u201d are \u201cnon-names\u201d. Also, what\u2019s a \u201cnon-name\u201d?  Is that like \u201cHe who shall not be named\u201d?  Your name is clearly a name - it\u2019s your name. \n\nKatherine is right that you cannot police her thoughts. You can, however, police her words when she uses them in so offensive a manner. Next time she does it, I\u2019d dig in - \u201cKatherine - you clearly have a deep-seated problem with me. It can\u2019t just be my name - no reasonable person would spend the energy and hostility that you have on my name, particularly after I\u2019ve made it clear that I like my name. So you must have some deeper problem with me. I\u2019d be grateful if you\u2019d name it so we can deal with it, instead of this ridiculously offensive \u2018your name isn\u2019t a name\u2019 garbage that\u2019s obviously false if you had any education about such things. It was never a very popular name until recently, but like other songbird names, it\u2019s been a valid gender-neutral Anglo-English name for thousands of years\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA. Get a pet, like a big drooling dog, and name it Kate", "NTA and I'm glad your husband is there to back you up. She's a b and a bully.\n\nWren is an awesome name. Next time someone asks for name help, make sure to tell them only ancient decrepit bats are named Katherine.", "Definitely NTA. She should keep her opinion to herself. Wren is a beautiful name meaning \u201csmall bird\u201d. Google Fairy Wren bird in Australia and you will see this beautiful small blue bird. \n\nJust ignore her. I have a feeling she\u2019s going to pick a horrible name for her child just to be edgy and unique.", "Perhaps you can't police what Katherine thinks and says, but you can decide never again to be in her presence.  I would recommend starting to have family and holiday celebrations at your house, and not inviting her. \n\nShould he apologize and promise to police her own words for cruelty, inappropriateness, and rancor, then perhaps you might reconsider.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  How on earth could you be TA?  Sounds like you're being gaslit by her.  Bullies can always come up with honorable excuses for their bullying.", "NTA\n\nReally you shouldn't talk to her anymore. She is personally attacking you for no reason. Basically  she is a bully.", "NTA.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true she\u2019s allowed to have her own opinion (and express it freely), it sounds like she\u2019s doing this intentionally to rile you up, which makes her very much the AH.\n\nYour options at this point are to ignore the jibe the next time she decides to use your name as an example (or better yet- laugh along with her!). This sort of bullying behaviour is fuelled by the attention it is bringing her. By either ignoring it, or pretending to agree with it, it\u2019s no longer \u2018fun\u2019 for her. \n\nOr, next time it comes up suggest a name you can both have a laugh at to take attention off your own.

Wren is a beautiful name that invokes thoughts of songbirds and tranquility. It has also been quite popular as a baby name in the last 10 years. So your SIL can shove her personal animosity where the sun don't shine. If you want to give her some of her medicine, every time she mentions your name as an example, you should chime in that the behavior of the person carrying the name can really influence how much you like it, see \"Katherine\" is a nice name, but if your experience is that that one Katherine was a bitch, you will always resent the name afterwards.", "NTA\n\nShe just comes across as insecure and petty.

Further, some people just don't listen and mishear or misinterpret it intentionally.\n\nI, for example, have a \"traditional\" legal name (my mother's specific logic was that it's hard to assume anything beyond my gender when seeing my full name). It's still been misspelled, parts of it mispronounced, people \"assign\" me diminutive nicknames I specifically tell them to avoid (there's one *very* popular one I detest).\n\nNow, because I'm petty and I happen to like uncommon, syllable nicknames, I'd counter her every time with \"Rin, stop attacking my name.\" And would refer to her as Rin as often as I could for the rest of that visit. Each time she starts - that'd be my pattern: Tell her to stop and then get offensive if she doesn't. Some people don't feel empathy unless they're forced to experience what they're actually putting you through.", "Wren is a really nice name.

I know he is suggesting we don't see her for a while, and I think that might be needed given how things are.", "It seems like it is just her way.

Either way I wish you the best of luck, Wren", "Yeah, it\u2019s concerning that she\u2019s so rigid on ideas and then vocal about it even after being asked to stop - you can imagine a LOT of scenarios where she\u2019ll alienate other parents and/or hurt her children. People who insist on a \u2018right way\u2019 can often veer off into intolerant bigot territory.", "I bet she would name her kids Ayden, Jayden, and Cayden. Yeah, a family I knew. Also, Kelby?", "Apparently they don't apply to her. Sometimes I am just really glad she has never brought my child's name into any of this. That would be the very final straw for me with her. But space like my husband has said will be good.", "Thank you!", "Nope. She goes for names like Elizabeth, Joseph, James, Emily, etc."]}
