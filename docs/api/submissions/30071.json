She has 3 kids from 2 previous relationships. 9,7,5 years old. She is a very hardworking, motivated woman in nursing school. We have the kids 3-4 nights a week and she co-parents well with both of her exes. I knew what I was signing up for when we got into this serious relationship. We currently live together and I get along well with all the kids, however sometimes it is just A LOT to handle. I keep going back and forth on having a kid. I am 30 years old and she is 29. She said she doesn't want to have a baby beyond 35. Her friend reached out to her asking if she would be a surrogate (which has apparently always been one of my girlfriends dreams) Personally, I draw the line here. I do not want to support 9 months of pregnancy. She gave an option of having a baby with me and I just am so back and forth. She has been getting frustrated because she wants to plan for the future...some weeks I can see having another kid with her (4 kids in the house) other times, there's no way. I think I'd be satisfied helping her raise her 3. Am I the asshole for not wanting to support a surrogacy or being unsure about having another kid with her? Another issue that comes up frequently is me wanting to move out west. She said she would be for it...of course she'd have to look into custody issues. Anyhow...I am just using this to vent. I'm not sure if I am being unreasonable? I help out as much as I can when we do have her kids here. I even watch them for one of her overnight shifts while she is working.\n\nEDIT: To add, this girl and I dated 15 years ago, back in high school. She really is a wonderful person and I love her to pieces. I see a future with her, just not sure if I want to add another baby to the mix (I have considered it).   \nShe did get pregnant 3 months into our relationship and willingly had an abortion. I don't think she is trying to \"trap\" me. She just gets frustrated by me changing my mind so often about whether or not I want to have a kid with her.   \nHer first child came from a military marriage and they were opposite one another.

I believe that a couple shouldn't actively try to have a child without being married/in a commited and long relationship. Having such a relationship means that two people believe that they will stay together and they will continue to work on their relationship. If you both have a child and decide to break up for whatever reason, this introduces complications into the child's life. That isn't fair. This isn't like other situations where there is a divorce, someone accidentaly gets pregnant, or a person decides to have a child and raise it on their own without a partner.\n\nAlso, it is wierd that she just wants a baby in her and it doesnt matter if it is surrogacy or her own child. These two scenarios are so different. In surrogacy, you are not the parent of a child. Whereas having your own kid is a life long commitment.

A year into a relationship is way too early to be receiving ultimatums about having a kid. And that is what this is, whether you're comfortable admitting it or not. She is asking far too much of you far too early in the relationship. Perhaps it is simply that because she's already had three children, she's forgotten how massive a step it is to decide to have a child, rather than her trying to force you to have a child so she has another future ex paying child support.\n\nBut either way, it is utterly unacceptable to be putting any pressure on you for either the surrogacy or having a child together.

There is absolutely nothing sexual about surrogacy, so thinking about her being pregnant with someone else's child makes it sound like she has sex with someone else when in reality it'll probably be IVF and there will be an audience in the room when it happens.
