We have 3 kids together (17F, 15M, & 13M).  I have primary custody of the kids because we live on opposite sides of the country.  We alternate major holidays and he gets them for 2-months during the summer.  He works in the entertainment industry in California, while I live near family in Georgia.  \n\nLast summer, our daughter decided that she didn't want to visit him during the summer.  She didn't want to miss a summer with her friends, has a part-time job, and had other summer activities here she didn't want to miss.  The three of us talked about it and my ex was very understanding and supportive of our daughter's choice, even though he said he was saddened and disappointed by it.  But, he didn't push her on it and we all came away from the conversation in agreement.  \n\nThis summer is the same thing.  She'll be a senior this fall and wants to stay here with her friends again.  We had another conversation and although my ex expressed his feelings and hoped she'd change her mind, he didn't push her on it.  Our son's have been with him for about 3 weeks now.  \n\nLast week, he called me and asked me if I could send him the boys' passports because he wants to take them overseas.  Apparently, a colleague of his invited him and the boys to take a trip on his yacht down the Pacific coast for a couple weeks with stops in Mexico and Central America.  This was a spontaneous thing, it wasn't planned.  To say I was a bit put-off by the whole thing would be an understatement.  I don't feel 100% comfortable with it, but I understand it's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the kids.\n\nHowever, our daughter can't go and that rubs me the wrong way.  I asked my ex if there was any way our daughter could go too, and he said that unless she can make it there by the time they leave, they can't wait for her.  Our daughter has multiple activities already planned for that timeframe that we have either already paid for or that she is really looking forward to.  When she heard about the trip idea that her brothers would go on without her, she was very disappointed.\n\nSo, I told my ex that unless there's a way for our daughter to go too, I am not going to send him the passports or give him my permission as primary guardian to take them to another country.  My ex gave me quite a bit of pushback on it because he and the boys are really looking forward to it and he says it's a unique bonding experience that I am depriving them of.  \n\nWhen I told him how disappointed our daughter is about it, he said that if she's old enough to make mature decisions about how she spends her time and doesn't want to visit him, then she's old enough to realize that those decisions mean she might miss out on things that her brothers get to do while they are with him.  The boys have been practically begging me to let them go and I know if I don't let them, they will blame me and their sister for it.", "created_utc": 1689082596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wrmud/aita_for_not_letting_my_ex_take_our_sons_overseas/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do they have to miss out on something fun just because their sister made a choice to not come along and is not jealous?\n\nYour daughter was invited and can go. She is just choosing not to. She would rather do what she already has planned, and just have them delay it, which they can't. \n\nYou and your daughter are being incredibly selfish.

We have 3 kids together (17F, 15M, & 13M).  I have primary custody of the kids because we live on opposite sides of the country.  We alternate major holidays and he gets them for 2-months during the summer.  He works in the entertainment industry in California, while I live near family in Georgia.  \n\nLast summer, our daughter decided that she didn't want to visit him during the summer.  She didn't want to miss a summer with her friends, has a part-time job, and had other summer activities here she didn't want to miss.  The three of us talked about it and my ex was very understanding and supportive of our daughter's choice, even though he said he was saddened and disappointed by it.  But, he didn't push her on it and we all came away from the conversation in agreement.  \n\nThis summer is the same thing.  She'll be a senior this fall and wants to stay here with her friends again.  We had another conversation and although my ex expressed his feelings and hoped she'd change her mind, he didn't push her on it.  Our son's have been with him for about 3 weeks now.  \n\nLast week, he called me and asked me if I could send him the boys' passports because he wants to take them overseas.  Apparently, a colleague of his invited him and the boys to take a trip on his yacht down the Pacific coast for a couple weeks with stops in Mexico and Central America.  This was a spontaneous thing, it wasn't planned.  To say I was a bit put-off by the whole thing would be an understatement.  I don't feel 100% comfortable with it, but I understand it's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the kids.\n\nHowever, our daughter can't go and that rubs me the wrong way.  I asked my ex if there was any way our daughter could go too, and he said that unless she can make it there by the time they leave, they can't wait for her.  Our daughter has multiple activities already planned for that timeframe that we have either already paid for or that she is really looking forward to.  When she heard about the trip idea that her brothers would go on without her, she was very disappointed.\n\nSo, I told my ex that unless there's a way for our daughter to go too, I am not going to send him the passports or give him my permission as primary guardian to take them to another country.  My ex gave me quite a bit of pushback on it because he and the boys are really looking forward to it and he says it's a unique bonding experience that I am depriving them of.  \n\nWhen I told him how disappointed our daughter is about it, he said that if she's old enough to make mature decisions about how she spends her time and doesn't want to visit him, then she's old enough to realize that those decisions mean she might miss out on things that her brothers get to do while they are with him.  The boys have been practically begging me to let them go and I know if I don't let them, they will blame me and their sister for it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No reason everyone in the family should bow to her whims. \n\nLesser equivalent would be him taking them out to a restaurant she likes so you don't let them go because she would miss out.

Normally they may not make that connection immediately, but you can't exactly rely on your husband to not spell it out for them.\n\nI can spell it out for you though. You have let your daughter do whatever fun activities she wants, likely because you enjoy the upset it causes your husband to be deprived of seeing his daughter.

Like, shouldn\u2019t she just expect he\u2019ll find fun things because he has this opportunity and desire to do something fun once the summer comes? \n\nAlso, you\u2019re just speculating about the spite thing and you honestly don\u2019t know. Your ex could be planning these fun trips for a far more innocent reason than trying to spirit your daughter\u2014like it\u2019s summer, he has the kids, and he has the vacation time. Instead you\u2019re trying to making it seem like he has ulterior motives. I suspect this is because you know your decision isn\u2019t fair to your sons and you\u2019re grasping at any justification you can.\n\nYour ex is even saying your daughter can still go if she can make it out there in time. This kind of once-in-a-lifetime trip can cost thousands. It might even be worth it, cost wise, for your daughter to just drop whatever plans she already has.\n\nBy forcing your sons not to go, what exactly are you hoping for? When would you want this trip (which is reliant on your ex\u2019s friend\u2019s schedule and this not something your ex can control) to happen then?", "Honestly, OP?\n\nYour further comments have a tone to them that sounds resentful to your ex concerning your divorce. And it feels like you want to make co-parenting difficult for him. This could be subconscious and you might not recognize this. You might be feeling a way towards him (and those reasons might be justified), but keep your kids out of this.\n\nBy your accounts, your ex seems like a good father to your shared children. Things didn't work out between the two of you, and that sucks. But don't bring that into his relationship with the kids. When your kids are with you, I'm sure there are times that some of them don't get the exact same experiences as the other. How is that fine when they're with you, but different when they are with him? \n\nYour daughter made a choice not to go see her dad, and it seems like you not only supported her in her decision but might even be low key encouraging it. With her making these decisions, you expect your ex to be understanding. You should be doing the same. Your boys decided they wanted to be with their dad the past two summers and that will entail them doing a lot of things that their sister won't be a part of simply because she chose not to be there. That's not punitive, that's the effect of choosing not to be there.", "Great. So you\u2019re turning your sons into bargaining chips and being resentful even given the choices that your daughter has made. Seems pretty clear you\u2019d like all the kids to not have contact with your ex, which is seriously AH behavior.", "Why should your sons not get these memories just because your daughter is choosing not to go?", "YTA and your username is wrong. Your daughter is not being left behind. She is actively choosing to not visit her father and therefore missing any activities they may do while they\u2019re there", "But she chose not to go to her dad for the summer. It's not like he is taking the boys while she is unable to go!", ">He's definitely relished in being the part-time, \"fun\" dad since the divorce. He doesn't have to deal with the nitty-gritty and gets to do fun stuff and then send them home. \n\nThis is such a self centered, unempathetic, and resentful interpretation of both your ex's motivation and his experiences. \n\nYou say that he \"relishes\" his role as a part-time dad. What else is he supposed to do?  His time with his children is extremely limited so he makes the best of the time he does have. Would it be better if he didn't make extra time for his kids in the narrow windows of access that he's afforded? You are coming across as very cold and mean.\n\nYou mention sending them home where the nitty gritty of daily life takes place. Would you like to trade with him? How would you feel if your kids didn't view your home as their home? You should celebrate the fact that you have the privilege of seeing your kids everyday. It seems like you don't react very well to being separated from your kids for a few months a year. Imagine what your ex and the kids experience with being separated for the majority of the year. He'd trade places with you in a heartbeat.", "If that\u2019s the case it\u2019s kind of a dick move, but also seems unlikely. It\u2019s natural to want to do cool things with your kids if you have the time and resources. It also seems like your daughter deserves it. She\u2019s 17 and certainly old enough to know she\u2019s hurting him. It\u2019s just as likely that she\u2019s choosing not to go during the summers out of spite.", "YTA of epic proportions. Your daughter made a decision not to go and they are doing things she wants to do. This is her fault!", "If your daughter chooses to stay with you, do you really expect your ex & sons to just sit at home because she isn't there? Wow, you become more of an AH with each addition.", "You withholding activities from your other kids seems pretty spiteful. You appear to be trying to rub your power over the kids in his face. This isn\u2019t a good look for you.", "Even if it IS out of spite - it's an amazing trip your boys wouldn't have had otherwise so who cares. Take your daughter by yourself to Yosemite.", "Yea. There's only one person here acting out of spite. Hint - it's not the father", "Honest question, what do you want from him?  Do you want him to not do anything over the summer that the daughter might have enjoyed?  If you are both going to let her make the choice to not go (despite the custody agreement) she needs to accept that her brothers are going to get to do some fun shit.   Do you want them to just have a boring summer?", "Even if it\u2019s not spontaneous, stop punishing your sons! Even if he\u2019s the fun dad, stop punishing your sons! Even if your daughter is sad she\u2019s made other plans, stop punishing your sons! Even if he\u2019s doing it out of spite, stop punishing your sons!\n\nTHEY will be the ultimate losers here, just so you feel you can rebalance the power equation.", "So, he works his ass off in order to enjoy life with his kids during his time with them, and you are framing this to be a bad thing? He's got them for two months. Teenage angst does not take a two month break - you're lucky to get a good day a week free of drama no matter what grand adventure you're on. \n\nStop punishing your kids for the fact that you and your ex have different ideas of how to live life.", "Your daughter made the choice not to go visit him, therefore it's reasonable to think she would miss out on stuff her brothers get to do. What do you want your sons  to do sit in a house all summer staring at the walls?", "Were you expecting him to keep them inside doing chores all summer? Why do you hate your sons?", "Of course you are. You're punishing your sons to spite their father and claiming he's treating his daughter badly because you two didn't work.  You are SUCH a big YTA.", "The thing is, it's absolutely fine if your daughter doesn't want to join your husband in her summers. But that doesn't mean her father can't plan fun things to do with the children who do want to visit. That's just not fair.", "Exactly!", "Pretextual \"reasons\" for exactly this - it's suddenly ok if daughter goes. \n\nCompletely fabricated post-hoc justifications. OP is a serious AH.", "100% this. OP is punishing her sons because she can't separate her resentment for her ex from her parenting decisions. \n\nYTA and don't be surprised if this permanently alienates your sons from you, for good reason.", ">How has he relished in being the fun dad? Does he make a point to bring up how he doesn't have to do the nitty gritty things? Was he the one that moved away after the divorce, and if so, do you think it was partly to avoid having a major parenting role?\n\nHe gets to do all the things that he wants to do that led to our divorce.  Dedicate all the time he wants to his job, rub elbows with famous people, then take extended time off to do fun stuff with the kids while they are there.  He doesn't have to deal with the teenage angst or day-to-day stuff like school or activities.  He just does this big, grandiose gestures and calls it parenting.  \n\nI moved away with the kids because I needed support and help with the kids and I knew he wouldn't be the one to provide it, so I moved closer to family.  He didn't even try to stop me.", "She desperately wants her and her daughter to be the victims in this situation.", "So he\u2019s just supposed to sit around and do nothing with the boys so your precious daughter, who doesn\u2019t care to see him, doesn\u2019t miss out?  Wow. It sounds like this is the life he wants to lead and is including the boys rather than taking time out of his boring life to wow them. Your daughter should learn that life is about choices and she made hers.", "You moved away. Have fun with your sons hating you!", "It's not exactly fair to hold you choosing to move across the country against your ex. That was a choice you made yourself, just like your daughter opted to make other plans this summer. Choosing not to stop you doesn't really read as a malicious action to me given he's trying to be accommodating of what the kids want when he has them or is supposed to have them. He isn't the one acting like a bitter ex over things punishing kids from what you've shared.", "Look, I'm not blaming you for moving away at all. I totally understand needing a support system for you and the kids after a divorce-I know my own mom wanted to move back to family in another state when she and my dad got divorced. But it's pretty ridiculous of you to be accusing him of being the fun dad who only gets to do the easy stuff and not deal with the day to day when *you're* the one who moved the kids away. You don't let him do the day to day. And that's totally fine if that was the best solution, but then why be upset with him for your actions? If you hadn't moved, he'd have to deal with the day by day. But you did, and again, no judgement on making the best choice for your family, but it kind of sounds like he has little choice to be the fun dad.\n\nWhy would he try to stop you from moving? Would you rather he force you to stay and prevent you from getting the help you needed? If he had, would you have been able to make it in California on your own? He would have been a bad parent if he caused his kids to suffer-if moving away was the best thing you could have done, why would you want him to stop you from doing it?\n\nAnd I still want to know about his intentions regarding the trips. When did he plan (or at least announce) the Yosemite trip and when did your daughter let him know she wouldn't visit him that summer? Is this another trip she specified wanting to go on to make you think he's trying to spite her this year? Does he do anything else that makes you think he's trying to get back at her?", " So by you moving away gave him the permission to be a \"Disney Dad\". Maybe the boys down the road ask the court to let them live with him. I read you other comment on this matter. I would not be to sure of yourself on this.", "Reading this, I can't help but feel that you hold a resentment towards your ex and this whole situation is one way for you to get back at him.\nJust with the catch that your sons take the brunt of the hit in this scenario, as you deprive them of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, based on something they have no control over.\n\nYour other comment with your \"legitimate concerns\" reeks of motivational reasoning, as all of these concerns would apply as well if your daughter were to join.\n\nYTA big time. If I were your sons and you went through with not letting them go, I'd resent you for the rest of your life and probably go low contact once hitting 18.\n\nDo the right thing and let your sons go.", ">He didn't even try to stop me.\n\nif he had tried to stop you, would you not be here grousing about how he held you back from your chosen support system and he's being selfish to put his wants over what you need to raise the kids?", "I promise you they'll understand the difference between fun part-time dad and responsible mom, although it might not be until they're older. Kids figure all that out later in life. For now, why not use him for your kids to get great experiences? And I hope you're not encouraging your daughter's behavior and not visiting him-- she'll figure that out and resent you for it. Just stick with being a good (responsible) mom and keep your thoughts about the jerkness of their dad-- you picked him to be their father, not their fault.", "How soon after the divorce did you move away?", ">When did he plan (or at least announce) the Yosemite trip and when did your daughter let him know she wouldn't visit him that summer?\n\nFirst I heard of it was when my oldest son sent a Snapchat out while they were driving there.  No one let me know about it.  Our daughter told him in May both last year and this year that she wouldn't be visiting, so about a month before the visit.", "A month, okay. That's a bit of a nebulous time. It's long enough that he *could* have come up with plans to visit on the fly but also short enough that he could have been organizing it for a few months and didn't want to back out by the time she told him. Aside from the Yosemite trip, has he done anything to your knowledge to make his daughter feel bad for not visiting? Or is there something about his character that makes it seem likely? I'm just trying to understand where your belief that he's doing this comes from. Bc I know it's easy to assume the worst of \"fun dads,\" but I don't like thinking the worst of someone just bc of a stereotype."]}
