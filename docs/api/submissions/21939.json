{"id": 21939, "submission_id": "14wrmud", "title": "AITA For not letting my ex take our sons overseas because our daughter can't go", "selftext": "I (38F) have been divorced from my ex-husband (40M) for 4 years.  We have 3 kids together (17F, 15M, & 13M).  I have primary custody of the kids because we live on opposite sides of the country.  We alternate major holidays and he gets them for 2-months during the summer.  He works in the entertainment industry in California, while I live near family in Georgia.  \n\nLast summer, our daughter decided that she didn't want to visit him during the summer.  She didn't want to miss a summer with her friends, has a part-time job, and had other summer activities here she didn't want to miss.  The three of us talked about it and my ex was very understanding and supportive of our daughter's choice, even though he said he was saddened and disappointed by it.  But, he didn't push her on it and we all came away from the conversation in agreement.  \n\nThis summer is the same thing.  She'll be a senior this fall and wants to stay here with her friends again.  We had another conversation and although my ex expressed his feelings and hoped she'd change her mind, he didn't push her on it.  Our son's have been with him for about 3 weeks now.  \n\nLast week, he called me and asked me if I could send him the boys' passports because he wants to take them overseas.  Apparently, a colleague of his invited him and the boys to take a trip on his yacht down the Pacific coast for a couple weeks with stops in Mexico and Central America.  This was a spontaneous thing, it wasn't planned.  To say I was a bit put-off by the whole thing would be an understatement.  I don't feel 100% comfortable with it, but I understand it's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the kids.\n\nHowever, our daughter can't go and that rubs me the wrong way.  I asked my ex if there was any way our daughter could go too, and he said that unless she can make it there by the time they leave, they can't wait for her.  Our daughter has multiple activities already planned for that timeframe that we have either already paid for or that she is really looking forward to.  When she heard about the trip idea that her brothers would go on without her, she was very disappointed.\n\nSo, I told my ex that unless there's a way for our daughter to go too, I am not going to send him the passports or give him my permission as primary guardian to take them to another country.  My ex gave me quite a bit of pushback on it because he and the boys are really looking forward to it and he says it's a unique bonding experience that I am depriving them of.  \n\nWhen I told him how disappointed our daughter is about it, he said that if she's old enough to make mature decisions about how she spends her time and doesn't want to visit him, then she's old enough to realize that those decisions mean she might miss out on things that her brothers get to do while they are with him.  The boys have been practically begging me to let them go and I know if I don't let them, they will blame me and their sister for it.", "created_utc": 1689082596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wrmud/aita_for_not_letting_my_ex_take_our_sons_overseas/", "score": 6937, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She would rather do what she already has planned, and just have them delay it, which they can't. \n\nYou and your daughter are being incredibly selfish.

We have 3 kids together (17F, 15M, & 13M).  I have primary custody of the kids because we live on opposite sides of the country.  We alternate major holidays and he gets them for 2-months during the summer.  He works in the entertainment industry in California, while I live near family in Georgia.  \n\nLast summer, our daughter decided that she didn't want to visit him during the summer.  She didn't want to miss a summer with her friends, has a part-time job, and had other summer activities here she didn't want to miss.  The three of us talked about it and my ex was very understanding and supportive of our daughter's choice, even though he said he was saddened and disappointed by it.  But, he didn't push her on it and we all came away from the conversation in agreement.  \n\nThis summer is the same thing.  She'll be a senior this fall and wants to stay here with her friends again.  We had another conversation and although my ex expressed his feelings and hoped she'd change her mind, he didn't push her on it.  Our son's have been with him for about 3 weeks now.  \n\nLast week, he called me and asked me if I could send him the boys' passports because he wants to take them overseas.  Apparently, a colleague of his invited him and the boys to take a trip on his yacht down the Pacific coast for a couple weeks with stops in Mexico and Central America.  This was a spontaneous thing, it wasn't planned.  To say I was a bit put-off by the whole thing would be an understatement.  I don't feel 100% comfortable with it, but I understand it's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the kids.\n\nHowever, our daughter can't go and that rubs me the wrong way.  I asked my ex if there was any way our daughter could go too, and he said that unless she can make it there by the time they leave, they can't wait for her.  Our daughter has multiple activities already planned for that timeframe that we have either already paid for or that she is really looking forward to.  When she heard about the trip idea that her brothers would go on without her, she was very disappointed.\n\nSo, I told my ex that unless there's a way for our daughter to go too, I am not going to send him the passports or give him my permission as primary guardian to take them to another country.  My ex gave me quite a bit of pushback on it because he and the boys are really looking forward to it and he says it's a unique bonding experience that I am depriving them of.  \n\nWhen I told him how disappointed our daughter is about it, he said that if she's old enough to make mature decisions about how she spends her time and doesn't want to visit him, then she's old enough to realize that those decisions mean she might miss out on things that her brothers get to do while they are with him.  The boys have been practically begging me to let them go and I know if I don't let them, they will blame me and their sister for it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No reason everyone in the family should bow to her whims. \n\nLesser equivalent would be him taking them out to a restaurant she likes so you don't let them go because she would miss out.

Normally they may not make that connection immediately, but you can't exactly rely on your husband to not spell it out for them.\n\nI can spell it out for you though. You have let your daughter do whatever fun activities she wants, likely because you enjoy the upset it causes your husband to be deprived of seeing his daughter.

Your ex could be planning these fun trips for a far more innocent reason than trying to spite your daughter\u2014like the fact it\u2019s summer, he has the kids, and he has the vacation time. Instead you\u2019re trying to make it seem like he has ulterior motives. I suspect this is because you know your decision isn\u2019t fair to your sons and you\u2019re grasping at any justification you can.\n\nYour ex is even saying your daughter can still go if she can make it out there in time. This kind of once-in-a-lifetime trip can cost thousands. It might even be worth it, cost-wise, for your daughter to just drop whatever plans she already has.\n\nBy forcing your sons not to go, what exactly are you hoping for? When would you want this trip (which is reliant on your ex\u2019s friend\u2019s schedule and this not something your ex can control) to happen then?", "Honestly, OP?\n\nYour further comments have a tone to them that sounds resentful to your ex concerning your divorce. And it feels like you want to make co-parenting difficult for him. This could be subconscious and you might not recognize this. You might be feeling a way towards him (and those reasons might be justified), but keep your kids out of this.\n\nBy your accounts, your ex seems like a good father to your shared children. Things didn't work out between the two of you, and that sucks. But don't bring that into his relationship with the kids. When your kids are with you, I'm sure there are times that some of them don't get the exact same experiences as the other. How is that fine when they're with you, but different when they are with him? \n\nYour daughter made a choice not to go see her dad, and it seems like you not only supported her in her decision but might even be low key encouraging it. With her making these decisions, you expect your ex to be understanding. You should be doing the same. Your boys decided they wanted to be with their dad the past two summers and that will entail them doing a lot of things that their sister won't be a part of simply because she chose not to be there. That's not punitive, that's the effect of choosing not to be there.", "Great. So you\u2019re turning your sons into bargaining chips and being resentful even given the choices that your daughter has made.

What else is he supposed to do?  His time with his children is extremely limited so he makes the best of the time he does have. Would it be better if he didn't make extra time for his kids in the narrow windows of access that he's afforded? You are coming across as very cold and mean.\n\nYou mention sending them home where the nitty gritty of daily life takes place. Would you like to trade with him? How would you feel if your kids didn't view your home as their home? You should celebrate the fact that you have the privilege of seeing your kids everyday.

Do you want him to not do anything over the summer that the daughter might have enjoyed?

I totally understand needing a support system for you and the kids after a divorce-I know my own mom wanted to move back to family in another state when she and my dad got divorced. But it's pretty ridiculous of you to be accusing him of being the fun dad who only gets to do the easy stuff and not deal with the day to day when *you're* the one who moved the kids away. You don't let him do the day to day. And that's totally fine if that was the best solution, but then why be upset with him for your actions? If you hadn't moved, he'd have to deal with the day by day.

I loved summers at home growing up and had my summer friends. I would have hated being put in a position of giving that up to spend the summer with younger siblings where I have no friends. I\u2019m sure as much as dad makes an effort to plan nice things to do he can\u2019t just not work for 2 months so it probably means a good amount of sitting around the house watching her younger brothers. It may be upsetting having her choose to stay in GA with her friends but it\u2019s also understandable.\n\nIf this really did just spontaneously come up then fine. There\u2019s just something about what he said that makes it feel icky like there\u2019s a revenge aspect for her not visiting. Like it\u2019s normal to want to make the visits extra special because he only sees them those two months but it kind of sucks if he\u2019s making this visit extra special for the brothers to make the daughter upset she didn\u2019t go. Still, she could just change her plans if she wants to go so badly, there\u2019s just a tone of spite that is rubbing me the wrong way.", "The only acceptable plan that could keep her is Beyonce or Taylor Swift tickets.

She's very concerned that her daughter will miss out, but doesn't give a flying fuck that the sons will miss out.\n\nLet me put this another way: why isn't she insisting that the sons get to do all the stuff her daughter is doing all summer?  If any child missing out on something fun is a problem, then shouldn't she be concerned?\n\nSeriously, look at this statement:\n\n> The boys have been practically begging me to let them go and I know if I don't let them, they will blame me and their sister for it.\n\nThe boys are begging to go, and her main concern is that they'll blame her when she keeps saying 'no.'", "OP it's completely out of order!

OP you need to send the boys there passports and give them your blessing otherwise you will ruin all your relationships with your kids and you coparenting relationship. Your sons will hate you for ruining a trip of a lifetime,  they will also hate there sister for it, which will cause fights in your household, then you daughter will turn on you for making the decision. Is that what you really want?", "That's fair. For my part, I'm not judging tone because we're not actually seeing the dad's response. We're seeing the mom's summary of the dad's response.", "> there\u2019s just a tone of spite that is rubbing me the wrong way.\n\nYou're really stretching to find fault here. The ex-husband is in a no-win situation with certain people.

Sometimes disappointed means that you look at your actions and say \u201cwell that was a fuck up\u201d and then you just kind of look down and move on with it in regret.

Your daughter is right to feel left out- your sons just aren\u2019t at the same stage of life she is, and the decision is easier for them for a multitude of reasons. \n\nI think what needs to happen is you send the passports, console your daughter, but tell your ex that he needs to do more than just demand his kids go to the other side of the country if they want a relationship with him. What happens when the kids are grown with kids and can\u2019t uproot every summer?", "NTA because the only reason he is taking the trip is to make the daughter feel bad and miss out for not wanting to spend her whole summer there.

But it\u2019s not that. Daughter can go if she makes it on time. But daughter already has plans. So it\u2019s not that daughter cant go because of the dad, but the daughter cant go because of her own plans.

Why are you holding this against them?", "Sincerely - she is depriving 2 of her children of an amazing experience because of choices the 3rd child made. \n\nI think the truth of the matter is she doesn\u2019t want her 13 and 15 yo children in South America. My guess is she\u2019s scared and using her daughter as an excuse which makes her double the A for not being open and honest with her children about her reservations.", "Notice the mother and daughter are unwilling to cancel her booked events or activities yet don\u2019t want the sons to have fun without her? That\u2019s some entitlement right there.", ">And they're absolutely right to blame their sister.\n\nI agree with you, except for this part. The boys should be blaming their mother, not their sister. \n\nFor one thing, there's no evidence in the post that the daughter is even asking for this. OP just says that she's disappointed, but you can be disappointed about a situation and still accept it. *OP* is the one considering withholding the boys' passports so that the can't participate just because their sister is choosing to prioritise previously planned activities. \n\nPlus, even if the daughter *is* pressuring their mother to not let them go without her, it's still the mother's decision, and she's still to blame for it.", "It\u2019s also a great way to control the ex-husband. I mean he can\u2019t go if the kids don\u2019t.", "Agree completely and hope OP (who is obviously YTA) is prepared for her boys to choose to live with their Dad full time soon if she doesn't send them their passports and let them attend this once in a lifetime trip. If OP is lucky, maybe they'll visit her and their sister in the summer, though they'll probably choose to stay with their Dad just as their sister chose to spend the last 2 summers with you. Then OP will be on here bitching about her ex \"keeping\" her sons from her and will probably try to force them to visit because it's \"unfair\" for her not to see her sons regularly. \n\nMy cousin was counting down the days until he turned 12 so he could choose to live with his Dad full time instead of splitting 50/50 custody with both parents because his Mom blatantly favored his younger half siblings. My cousin still has limited contact with his Mom and half siblings 25 years later but is super close with his Dad. I feel like the same thing will be happening soon with OP's sons and once they make that choice, she'll be able to focus fully on her golden daughter since clearly her daughter is the only child she really cares about.\n\nAlso, seems like a very one way street for OP. Does she do things with her daughter in the summer that her sons miss out on? Why is that OK but the boys doing something with their Dad is unfair and leaving out their sister. Sounds like her daughter has a busy summer with things that are already paid for, and OP doesn't care about her sons missing out on those things while they're spending the summer with their Dad. What else are the boys not going to be allowed to do without their sister this summer? Do they have to stay inside at home every day not doing anything fun because their sister isn't there to enjoy California's weather, beaches, and amusement parks? If Dad tries to take them to Disney, will they also not be allowed to go because their sister isn't there to attend? That's so fucked up. \n\nStop being an entitled hypocrite OP and teach your daughter that her choices have consequences that she has to live with because the world isn't going to stop and bend to her will whenever she wants something. Sounds like OP has already raised a very selfish and entitled daughter who is 17 now and will soon get a rude awakening to how the real world works. Sounds to me like daughter is a chip off OP's block which is why OP supported her decision to spend summers with her friends instead of seeing her Dad and spending time with her brothers. Now OP wants to punish her ex and her sons because it turns out they're going to have a better summer with their Dad than her daughter is having at home with OP.", "Agreed 100%.  Her daughter doesn't want to visit her dad during the summer?  Totally fine.  But then, when a cool trip comes up, suddenly the 2 sons can't go without her?  \n\nIt's not fair to the 2 brothers, who see the daughter clearly gets to have her cake and eat it too.", ">The boys have been practically begging me to let them go and I know if I don't let them, they will blame me and their sister for it.\n\nAs they should. I hope this prompts your ex and sons to seriously reconsider your primary custody.\n\n1. Your daughter choose not to visit. AND SHE'S STILL INVITED.

And from the sound of it, it is no surprise to OP, nor her daughter,  that the dad takes the kids to do cool stuff.

Choices have consequences,  and your daughter's choices aren't your sons' responsibility", "Wow, your daughter didn\u2019t want to see her father so you ruin your sons fun.  I thought it was because you didn\u2019t trust him with the boys outside the country.  If I had a poor relationship with my ex I would never let him take my kids outside the country.  That selfish explanation leads makes more sense than the trash you wrote", "YTA\n\nYou make it sound like your ex is punishing your daughter for not spending her summers with him, but he invited her! She just couldn't make it there on time because it's a last minute opportunity. \n\nI have no doubt that your ex is mature enough not to blame your daughter for your actions, but you are setting her up to be blamed by her brothers even though she isn't the one preventing them from taking this trip.", "YTA. She has made her choice for 2 summers in a row. If she can make those decisions she can also deal with the repercussions of those decisions. She only wants to go on an all expense paid trip, that's unfair to her father and brothers. So her father isn't allowed to do anything with her brothers that are currently with him unless it's something extravagant then she must be included or no one can? Hard no. She's about to be an adult and she needs to learn that not everything is about her, she can't/won't be included in everything in life, and that actions have consequences (both good and bad).", "Yup, YTA. Your daughter was allowed to make a choice for what she wanted to do with her summer. Which is great. But now, you\u2019re allowing your daughter\u2019s choice to take opportunities away from your sons. Which is not great. They will blame you and your daughter, because it is your fault. Why wouldn\u2019t they blame you? Keep it up if you want to blow up your family, but it\u2019s a mistake.", "yta obviously", "YTA. How can you justify this? Your ex was completely understanding your daughter wanted to stay home for the summer. He didn\u2019t push, he didn\u2019t take you to court. So you\u2019re going to punish your sons because your daughter gets her way? Yeah. AH.", "YTA. She chose her choice and now you're punishing the boys for choosing to spend the summer with your ex. Petty AF.", "YTA and you are also teaching your daughter to be one too.\n\nHer father has been supportive of her wanting to spend time away from him and her brothers for the last two summers, as he is aware that she is becoming a young adult and that this is both healthy and normal.\n\nHe gets 2 months in the summer and alternate major holidays.  For him that is a BIG sacrifice.  For the last 2 years he has agreed to only see his daughter on alternate major holidays.  That right there is a good Dad.\n\nWhy on earth would you want your sons to be deprived of a once in a lifetime experience, because your daughter made other plans in advance, that did not allow for her to take part?\n\nPlease look up FOMO.  Fear Of Missing Out.\n\nDon't deprive your sons and their Father of a cool bonding experience.  They won't forgive you.", "YTA. You are now saying that because your daughter made a choice it also gets to affect her siblings. Send over the passports and allow them to experience that once in a life time event. If your daughter is upset about it then that is just a life lesson. I can't fathom this kind of response and I wouldn't deprive my son of something like this over such a petty reason.", "YTA. Your daughter chose not to visit her dad.  Unfortunately that means she has to miss out on certain things.  \n\nIf you do this, your sons won\u2019t want to visit you.", "YTA.  Your daughter made the decision not to go and thus she forfeits all rights to complain when something cool comes along and she can't participate.  Big boy pants mean big boy decisions and big boy consequences.", "YTA!   Your daughter made her decision.   Why should your two boys have to pay for that?   \n\nSend the passports and a notarized letter giving your Ex permission to travel outside the country.", "YTA in this situation.  Your ex isn't preventing your daughter from going on this trip, she made the decision not to visit, you supported that decision and these are the consequences of hers and your decisions, you know consequences of not having everything when making adult decisions in life.\n\nYour decision to punish your boys because of you and your daughter's very much adult decisions, which from you post makes it sound like your daughter is mature enough to understand and isn't making a fuss about it, is just wrong and you should do better.", "YTA\n\nThis is part of growing up that your daughter has to learn to balance. There is cool stuff to do all the time all over the place and you have to make decisions on what you are going to do and not do. She chose to stay home in GA, work, hang with her friends and do other activities. This means no CA boat trip. It's simple really. And now to punish your sons directly because of your daughter's decisions will cause yours sons to resent BOTH of you. So great job on that relationship.", "Yta. It's not fair to hold your sons back because their sister is \"disappointed\". She has made the choice to not see her father and prioritize other things. Why should the sons miss out?\n\n It smacks of \"golden child\" syndrome. If she wants to go bad enough, she can choose to forgo her other things. Its not like dad said she couldn't go. And to expect everyone else to cater to your daughter's schedule is extremely entitled behavior. Looks like you care more about your daughter than your sons. Not saying that's true, but that's how it looks.", "YTA - your daughter is choosing to stay in GA, which is fine, she is old enough to make that choice. But her brothers shouldn\u2019t be punished for it. They are going to blame you for playing favorites when they get older. She could also still cancel her plans and take the passports out there.", "What\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019re punishing your sons because of a decision your daughter made. \n\nYTA", "*he said that if she's old enough to make mature decisions about how she spends her time and doesn't want to visit him, then she's old enough to realize that those decisions mean she might miss out on things that her brothers get to do while they are with him*\n\nHe is correct\n\nYTA", "Yep YTA.  And I hope you're looking very forward to the attitude that both you and your daughter are going to receive from your sons over this.  She made her choice to not visit dad for the past two years.  She doesn't get to have it both ways.  Instead of explaining this to her as an adult, you are punishing the two boys.  If I was your 15 year old, it would be a good long time before I forgot about this.  The 13 year old maybe not so long, but 15 is plenty old enough to have serious resentments built.", "YTA. Daughter made her choice. Let the boys go it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "Entitlement is a trait of narcissism. It's not a good thing to bring to the world. Especially when the other two brothers could have enjoyed the trip as a happy memory to look back on but no, it's disgraceful what narcissism does to our loved ones. Teaching your daughter that every man must suffer so she can have her way is what it sounds like.  When I was a child my mother said sometimes a little sacrifice is necessary to make others happy and I take that lesson with me. I know I can't go around expecting others to lose out for my benefit.", "YTA, let your boys go on the trip with their dad. Your daughter made her choice.", "YTA when I was probably about 19 my parents got invited to a distant relatives wedding overseas. I had final exams in college so I couldn't go. They went for like 10 days and had the vacation of a lifetime but eh that's life sometimes. I didn't throw a fit or ask them not to go. Sometimes thats how things are and I think your daughter will have to learn that at some point.\n\nWhats she going to do when she's working full time and her part-timer friends want to go on a roadtrip for a week? Or she's got work in the morning while her friends are hanging out late having fun on a weeknight? It just is what it is and I think what makes this particularly ridiculous is she *could* go if she really wanted to.", "YTA. Your daughter is almost an adult and made her decision. She needs to learn that decisions for one thing will cost us another - that's being an adult.\n\nYou are being cruel and malicious in denying your sons a fun trip. You're saying their sister controls what *they* do. If they didn't want to go that'd be one thing, but they do. Get over yourself. Apologize, overnight the passports, and give permission.", "YTA. Your daughter made her decision. That's great. She also has to live with the outcome. That's also great. That is life. I find it interesting that your daughter's disappointment has more value to you than both of your sons. Some one is going to be upset here, and it's strange that the 17 year old who had the most say in the matter, and made their own plans for the summer, is the one you most want to shield from that disappointment. \n\nThe right thing to do here is to tell your sons to have a good time on their trip, and kiss your daughter and tell her sometimes we can take a guess at what will be best for us and make the most of the choices we end up making. \n\nShe made lots of plans she's already looking froward to, so tell her to enjoy those plans to the best of her ability and make it an awesome summer with her friends. \n\nDo not punish your sons for your daughters choices. please.", "YTA.  It\u2019s not that your daughter CAN\u2019T go, it\u2019s that she\u2019s choosing other activities. She wants to have her cake and eat it too. It would be one thing if he said \u201cdaughter isn\u2019t invited\u201d or \u201cthis is a boys trip\u201d.", "YTA - your daughter is nearly an adult and made the choice to put her life ahead of spending time with her dad and brothers. Now she has to face the consequences. \n\nIf you don't send those passports, you're going to create a rift between the brothers and sister that won't be easily overcome.", "YTA. Your daughter made her choices. Why should her brothers have to suffer for her choices now? Your preference for your GC daughter is oozing in this post.", ">So, I told my ex that unless there's a way for our daughter to go too\n\nThere is. If she gets there in time to go. Your daughter is choosing not to go because she would rather to other things.", "YTA. What makes you think you have any control over the time your *EX* has with his own kids? This is his time with them, and I\u2019m sure if he tried to micromanage your time with them you\u2019d be miffed. Your daughter made the decision to stay with you so she could be with her friends, do the activities she wants and work. It sounds like her dad is disappointed with that, but allows her the room to make those choices. Honestly it sounds like you have massive control issues. Work on that.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re teaching your daughter all the wrong lessons.  \n\nFirst, you allowed (and let\u2019s face it, encouraged) her to skip her only significant time her father has with her all year.  You gave yourself and her a litany of justifications for this.  But in reality, you just allowed her to shirk a serious commitment because you don\u2019t want her to like her father, like you don\u2019t.\n\nAnd even you say that you daughter has multiple activities planned for the timeframe of the trip, that you\u2019ve paid for and she\u2019s looking forward too.  But she wants to go on this trip INSTEAD, so you\u2019re gonna allow her to shirk those commitments as well?  All the money you already spent?  Contradicting multiple decisions you and she already made?\n\n__And if your ex husband isn\u2019t okay with all your flip-flopping and poor judgment/example, then you\u2019ll hold your son\u2019s passports hostage and prevent them from having a good time too?__\n\nYou are a piece of work lady.  \n\nAnd you need to tread carefully, your kids are all at the age where they will start to see through the real meaning behind all of this, your insecurities and/or unresolved issues with you ex, and judge you for it.", "Yes, let them go. He is right, she made her decisions and has to live with them. Don\u2019t punish your boys for your daughters decision.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou're punishing your sons for a their sister choosing to not spend time with them and now being sad they get to actually do something fun.", "YTA. Your sons don't deserve to be punished for your hypocritical emotions towards your entitled daughter, shame on the both of you.", "YTA\n\nHe's right. Your daughter was only upset after she knew she wouldn't be going on this cool trip with them. Otherwise, she wouldn't have cared about going to visit her father. She isn't entitled to a trip when she doesn't even wanna be with the man that's providing it.", "yup. YTA, op", "Exactly, even if she couldn\u2019t go for the whole 2 months she should have carved out time and made an effort for a few weeks. OP YTA and if your daughter is throwing a fit then so is she. Let them go and not have them miss experiences just because your daughter made other choices.", "Don't drag the daughter just because she wanted to spend the summer earning some money and seeing her friends. Loads of young adults move miles away from their parents and don't spend their whole summers with them - it's not because they're asses, but because they have a life elsewhere", "And they're not far off from the age where they can just cut mom off altogether. OP may want to do what she can to curb this behavior before she drives her sons completely out of her life.", "Idk about that. As a grown adult, I've had to not visit family for what used to be regular/annual visits due to work/life (or just knowing that I'd need a vacation from the trip itself and opting out), but then find out something huge and once in a lifetime was going to be happening, and had to decide if I was going to go after all, if it was even possible.\n\nIt's completely normal to weigh the activities out and decide that working and being with your friends (for what seems to be the second time in her teenage life she's been able to do this) is more valuable than going across the country where you know no one, and who knows what her life is like when she's there? Could be she's treated differently than her brothers, if her father subscribes to traditional gender roles. We have no idea what the daughter's experience with the father is like, so to suggest she's insulting her dad by choosing to work/spend time with her friends before they all go off to college after her last year of high school and deciding it's worth it to go on this once in a lifetime trip is a bit of a stretch, imo.", ">I think OP needs to reframe her thinking and treat the trip as though it's boy scout camp.  If it were boy scout camp, I bet we wouldn't even be having this discussion.\n\nBingo.", "I think it's slightly worse than that even. It sounds like the daughter *can* go and has either decided not to or OP won't allow it and therefore, the boys can't go either. So it's actually just...daughter isn't going to visit her dad anymore and dad isn't allowed to do anything with their sons that their daughter thinks sounds fun.", "Man... I mean, OP is TAH... but so are you. Such a minor glimpse into the lives of a family who has raised 3 seemingly normal teenagers and you deduce that they have no place raising children?", "Yeah, we don\u2019t know if daughter is for forcing the boys not to go.\n\nAll we know is that she\u2019s disappointed", "If her father lives that far away she probably has no friends there and won't know what to do for 2 months. In her place I'd probably find a compromise like going 1 month or 2 weeks but it is what it is. \n\n\n\n\n I'm not sure why everyone is being so harsh on her, all the post said was that she's disappointed. Everyone is acting as if she told the mom to not let her brothers go or something.", "There aren't many flights at a reasonable price at the last minute.  I've had to get cost waivers from my management because they are so expensive and the CA team is jerking us around.", "She already paid for things she had planned, so it isn't like she isn't doing anything this summer.", "Exactly, i\u2019d like to think that should a danger or an accident occur, their father would be the first to step in and (maybe i\u2019m wrong here and she\u2019s an olympic swimmer) but would probably find it easier helping a teenage boy in the water than a 17 year old girl would.\nPersonally, i don\u2019t think the daughter is all that bothered. Disappointed, yes. But clearly she isn\u2019t that upset otherwise she would cancel her plans and go. This is just OP BS excuse to be bitter."]}
