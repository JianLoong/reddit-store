We made many friends and it felt like home.\n\nThen, my husband wanted to move back to Montana. His mom said we can stay at her place to save to buy a house there. I did not want this, but my husband said he wanted to move back, and we could always visit SC.  I saw that he missed home and probably didn\u2019t love SC as much as I did, so I compromised.\n\nThe issue:\n\nWe have been back in Montana at his parent's house for the past 9 months. When everyone is off work, I feel pressured to be \u201cpresent\u201d at dinner time. I don\u2019t mind this occasionally \u2013 but every day is taking a toll on my mental.\n\nSometimes I just want to relax on my own/with him. However, his parents are automatically included in many plans. For instance: When I went on a trip to Denver, my husband texted me \u201cI want to take you out for sushi, let\u2019s do that when you get back :).\u201d I got excited because I thought that meant a date night. But when I got back, it was all of us going out for sushi.\n\nYesterday:\n\nHe said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to church and then the movies afterward with my parents.\u201d I said, \u201cCan just the two of us have lunch?\u201d and then he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go pick up Chipotle and take it home and then go to the movies \\[with his parents\\].\u201d And then I said, \u201cNo I mean have a nice lunch, the weather is so nice! Let\u2019s grab lunch outdoors \u2013 just us.\u201d And then he said, \u201cI\u2019m not in an outdoors mood, I'm in a movies mood.\u201d\n\nThen I told him I feel like we do everything with his parents. I didn\u2019t want it to come out the wrong way and he cut me off and said, \u201cToo late.\u201d  And I said, \u201cThis is nothing against them \u2013 I want us to do our own thing.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not about to cut out my quality time with my family.\u201d\n\nI grew angry because we LIVE with them, have dinner with them almost every day, and go on dates with them.\n\nAfter we grabbed Chipotle to-go, I started bawling. I told him I can\u2019t enter the house looking like this, I need to take a breather. But he pulled up in his parent\u2019s driveway. As he was getting out of the car, I told him \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell them - I don\u2019t want them to take this the wrong way.\u201d He asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not coming inside?\u201d and I'm like \u201cAre you serious!? You really want me to come in looking like this!?\u201d So, I left for my parent\u2019s house to get some space. It\u2019s been two days and he has not checked in. I feel like I offended him, but I don\u2019t know how else I could\u2019ve voiced my concern.\n\nAITA for telling him we spend too much time with his parents?\n\nTLDR: My husband and I moved to his parent\u2019s home in Montana. After going on many double dates with his parents and having dinner after work with them almost every weeknight, I told him I feel like we do everything with his parents. He got mad and said that I'm trying to cut down his quality family time.

He made you move states just so you could be closer to his family. You saying that you want to spend time with him without his parents present is a completely reasonable request.\n\nThe fact that he hasn't called to check in or talk to you while you're at your parents is extremely telling. He does not care that you're hurt, he doesn't care that you're gone. His actions are communicating that he doesn't need or want you around.

What a turn off! Has he always been this immature and overly attached to his parents?", "NTA \n\nUnless you left something out I don't see how you were unreasonable. It's perfectly acceptable to want to spend some one on one time with your husband. That's kind of the whole point in getting married lol \n\nIt's a little off that he hasnt checked in after 2 days.

Try getting in touch with him now that you've both had a few days to cool off.", "NTA - he seems a little too comfortable with this living arrangement.", "NTA - you have needs of spending more time alone / with him, he's not interesting in even talking about it. You have also already compromised a lot by moving to Montana to begin with.", "NTA but girl I don't see this getting better. Do you have a plan and timeline for when to move out? Are you financially dependent on your husband? How long have you been together? I mean you can't even discuss having alone time let alone get the action to happen. How are you planning on getting this to work? I think you need to be more assertive. Tell him this is not working for you and you guys need to move out. Any pushback gets met by you responding on how you compromised and moved back to Montana for him. Now he can't compromise to move to a new place that isn't your parents house? See through his smokescreen bs about taking time away from his parents. Tell him you practice monogamy not polygamy and married him not him and his parents. And that you aren't asking him to never see his parents or move far away, just somewhere that isn't his house. If that doesn't go well then you have your answer for how your life is going to be for a while and you need to decide if you want to live like that. Even if you move out but still close you will be seeing a lot of your inlaws. Up to you if that sounds good. But you definitely need to put your foot down and die on this hill.

Your husband sounds like the umbilical cord was never cut. I personally might move back with my own parents.

You said you stayed with your parents, maybe they\u2019re local?     \nAnyway, you have a husband issue not an in-laws issue.  You are his family, too.  You want a husband not a roommate and he\u2019s not listening.  Sadly, maybe he isn\u2019t interested.  You have to communicate and be prepared for his not compromising on this, too.   Ask yourself, what do you want?  You can only control your behavior not his.", "NTA  \nWhere exactly was the compromise? You did solely what he wanted while you gave up the life you had built.  And now he is showing you where his priorities lie, more \"quality time\" with his family you are with constantly instead of time with you. \n\nTime for couples counseling.", "NTA O.P. I am so sorry that you are going through this. It sounds suffocating.\n\nI lived with my in laws for three years. It doesn't get better. Your husband views the things his parents do as very normal and even unproblematic because he grew up with them. \n\nBut for you, the situation is entirely different because your in laws are not your family of origin. I can tell you from experience that no matter how often I spoke with my husband about his parents, he just didn't understand. \n\nFor your own mental health you need to stop living with your husband's parents, whether he understands and comes along or not.", "NTA. So he wanted to live in Montana with his parents, and you wanted to stay in SC with your actual life and friends, and the compromise was\u2026.. to move to Montana and live with his parents\u2026.. that\u2019s all we needed to know- this man does not care about what you want or need.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being really selfish. That's really all there is to it. \n\nYou need to get out and make efforts to build your own life in Montana. \n\nAt some point you need to figure out if you stay there or go elsewhere. It sounds like SC wasn't for him -- but Montana isn't for you so far.", "Thank you. Yes, that's my plan - I am staying away until he responds. I feel like he is not prioritizing our time together. \n\nI actually sent him a text yesterday after I calmed down. But still no response. I just wonder how long it will take :/", "Yes exactly! Once I got married it was my understanding that we were each other's family first. But I feel like I am being treated as a second-class citizen compared to his family", "We saw my family but NOWHERE near as much as his.

I never saw anything wrong with this as I value positive family relationships, but now I feel it cutting into my own emotional needs.", "I already texted him yesterday after I cooled off but I got no response. I find this very strange since the last time he saw me I was an emotional wreck..", "Yes! I have brought up therapy for months and he constantly refuses. I crave therapy because I need a moderator to communicate my concerns with him and his concerns with me in a non-biased atmosphere. \n\nAlso, I adore his family too so this is hard for me to even say I want \"less\" time with them, but really I just want more time with my husband...That's why I got married in the first place??", "I would say if he doesn't respond/reach out within a week you should send a text to him stating you're going to be coming by (give a specific time) to get your stuff from their place.

I'm sorry this is happening OP :(", "Don't send him any more texts.\n\nIt's not a compromise unless both parties cut back on their wishes. There was no compromise with you moving in with his parents, but a sacrifice, because he got exactly what he wanted with absolutely no consideration for your wants and needs.\n\nIf you're the one constantly making sacrifices so that he can do what he wants, then you're not in a partnership. You deserve better than this.", "Make sure the next text has a link to the papers you're filing, NTA, and I'm very sorry.", "Sheesh,  he is being a jerk by not responding.   Poor OP.   You are NTA", "This is no longer a partnership.  For whatever reason, he wants to be pampered by his parents again.  NTA OP  Talk to a family lawyer if you haven't yet.

It's bizarre that he's so fixated on spending so much time with his parents and just expects you to join in, no questions asked. \n\n I saw some calling for a divorce. It seems extreme, but maybe you and your husband aren't on the same page anymore.", "I hope that this turns out different, but I think he is waiting for an apology from you regarding his parents and how you wanted to exclude them. Just my observation from men that I have seen who have been like this. You need to decide what you want to do and how you want to live ur life going forward. Clearly it is not healthy for you to be living with his parents(and rightfully so) but not only does he not see it, he seems to be doubling down.", "\"That's why I got married in the first place\" is key.

They mean their family not yours. \n\nLines like \"for family\" sadly I have found out are nearly always a form of controlling behavior.", "NTA.   You didn't compromise, you ended up doing what he wanted.  You want therapy to work through your issues, he refuses.  You want to spend just a bit of time alone with him, and he refuses.  You leave, and he's refusing all contact.\n\nIt sounds like you two are on drastically different pages and want very different things.  If he is unwilling to work on it, and unwilling to give you just one dinner, when you MOVED for him, then it might be time to accept that your future is not together.", "NTA Divorce this loser. He\u2019s taken you away from your support systems and trapped you with his family. This happens a lot in my culture with newly wed wives and it almost always goes bad, so IMO I tend to see this behaviour as manipulative and abusive.

This would 100% be a deal break for me. Sorry you\u2019re in this position OP.", "OP, NTA of course, and it seems you're still in love with your husband.\nBut here's the fact: not only he's a mama/dad boy who dates with his parents (omg I can't imagine how you felt while writing it), but you also married into a family that enables it. No normal parent would witness this situation without asking the son what's going on. Seems like a pushed lack of independency.\n\nSo, as it seems you still love him, my uncalled suggestion would be to set the \"therapy or bye\" line, because this person clearly needs to understand how a couple work, and it's needed a professional, it is not something you can do by yourself.\n\nAlso: where exactly did you compromise??? Whishing you all the best. It's a tough thing, but not impossible. Go girl!\n\nEdit: saw now that you already asked for therapy and that he's a mama boy.

Adults can manage different priorities at different times. Even your spouse won't be the priority all of the time or no matter what. Marriage doesn't erase your prior connections or bonds. There are still times it's fine to prioritize your parents, your siblings, your friends, your job, your hobbies. \n\nThat said, your spouse should be a top priority. If not #1 at every moment then surely your #1 overall, at least prior to kids. It doesn't sound like your husband cares much about your needs at all unfortunately."]}
