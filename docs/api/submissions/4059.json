I (27F) have no relationship with her. I do my best to avoid any family events that she is attending. My grandparents and my father never had a great relationship.

She passed away in May from cancer. \n\nI kept the camp the same as they had left it and currently have my girlfriend(28F) living with me. I used some of the inheritance money on debt and student loans. I still have some left over and am thinking about taking my girlfriend on a trip to visit her family. She is from Australia and hasn't been able to see her family since she moved here. \n\nMy father spent the money he received on Amy. They announced last month that Amy was pregnant and were struggling to afford stuff for the baby. My father dos work and Amy does not. My father reached out to me a few days ago regarding the money asking if I was willing to give some money to Amy as she needed some money to purchase baby clothes and other necessaries. \n\nI responded back to my father to let him know that the money I received was mine and had no interest in giving Amy anything.

Your Dad and Amy know where babies come from and as adults they are responsible for any they bring into this world. They are not taking about a one time need.

Your grandparents left everybody what they wanted them to have. Your father should have made better choices with his money. They both should have made better reproductive choices if they truly cannot afford to have a child.

It also sounds like your father can't or won't tell Amy any of the things she needs to hear as someone who doesn't have a job but clearly likes spending money.
