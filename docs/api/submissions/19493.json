We would constantly go out for dinner and drinks. We would laugh and have great conversations about life and relationships. We confided in each other about many personal things. Every time we went out I typically would pay because she always had some excuse or told me money was tight. I spent a lot on her. I didn\u2019t mind because I truly saw her as a good friend. At Christmas I got her a $300 giftcard to a luxury spa. She told me she was so stressed and so I wanted her to pamper herself and feel better. She was so happy to get the giftcard and said she couldn\u2019t wait to get a massage. She didn\u2019t get me anything which I\u2019ll admit was a bit hurtful. I understood though because she said she was saving money. As time passed I started to notice dark personality traits coming out. She was very paranoid and anxious all the time.  She asked me if other co-workers were talking about her. Ofcourse they weren\u2019t. I then found out she was talking behind my back and putting me down in front of other co-workers. She started manipulating the team and owner of the business into believing I wasn\u2019t doing my job correctly and that she could do a better job. I finally had enough and quit. She wasn\u2019t the person I thought she was and I needed to remove myself from a toxic work environment. I was angry she tried to hurt me when all I had done was be there for her..I felt so betrayed for trusting her. It\u2019s hard for me to trust people. A week after I quit, I went to the spa I bought her gift card at and asked if there was any way I could return it. They said no but I could use the funds. It was technically under my account.

I am dumbfounded at all the comments calling her asshole .\n She was deliberately and actively hurting OP by damaging her professional image and turning her coworkers against her what ultimately led to her quitting her job  that's what an enemy would do not a friend, even less a friend who is supposedly grateful for an expensive and toughtful gift (they didn't even reciprocate), taking back the ticket isn't even remotely matching that vile betrayal. OP truly went easy on her. \nI hope OP would find a better job and better friends who would appreciate the generous and empathetic person she is and wish this awful thing won't further harm her .", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wish you could have kept your job.\n\nA lot of us have been betrayed by a so called good friend. People will see her for who she is.", "YTA\n\nNot because of what you did to your ex-coworker, but because of the issue that you created for the spa business.  Not saying that ex-coworker isn't an AH and didn't deserve what you did, but you involved other people in the fallout for your revenge scheme.", "ESH but I would be tempted to do the exact same thing.  You\u2019re not in the same stratosphere of AH as your frenemy by a huge margin", "YTA because you did it without notifying her. Odds are at some point she's going to get a $300 spa treatment, assume that her gift card will cover it, and then be told she has to pay out of pocket with money she may or may not have for it. I get that she's not your friend, and maybe was never your friend, but that's still a terrible position to put someone in.", "ESH. Her behaviour is not ok and she was a bad friend. You can\u2019t take back a gift you have given. I understand why you did that, but it was an AH move. I don\u2019t think you are a massive AH given the circumstances", "YTA you gave a gift to a friend. It's not like a wedding ring where there are expectations tied to it. You didn't even tell her you spent the money.", "YTA. It was a Christmas gift and since you are the better person you should have left it alone and maybe even reminded her to use it. If she had said she didn\u2019t want to, then you go for it and treat yourself. You kind of stooped down to her level by doing something that you secretly hoped would be vindictive for what she\u2019s done to you.", "nods ^furiously", "... after she's gotten the treatment, gets the final invoice and whips out her gift card to pay!", "If she hasn't (tried to) use it in the last 5mos, I doubt she will any time soon...", "That's a good point tbh. It affects the spa and their professionalism but I suppose that was their decision as well. They'd just have to handle how the chips fall.", "Eh I think it's par for the course when you chose to shit talk someone that was only nice to you. One of those justified asshole stories imo."]}
