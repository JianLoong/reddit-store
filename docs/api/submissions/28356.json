I'm taking a few days away from my girlfriend and her mother", "selftext": "My girlfriend lived with me for about a year (been together 9 years total) in my house and we decided to move to another state to buy a house together. She asked if we can get a house with a mother-in-law suite. Her mother recently became a widow and was living alone in an isolated area in another state. She would pay for the construction of her place with the money from the sale of her house and would have to stay with us for a month or so (with her aggressive, untrained terrier.)   \n\nWe bought the house with my money, paid contractors with my money, and bought most of the furniture with my money.  Without my knowledge she told her mother to list her house the moment I accepted the offer . So her mother moves into our house about two weeks after we move in. We have a ton of  work being done in the house so she moves in lock, stock, and barrel as contractors are all over our place hammering, sawing, etc..  So the house is a wreck and all of her crap is everywhere.  We find out that she can't really afford the mother-in-law suite if everything is done to code.  So we found a contractor she could afford but would only start when our house was done so no inspectors snoop around.\n\nIt's been FIVE MONTHS and I am losing my sanity.  The woman screams at her untrained dog 24/7 and leaves all of her crap everywhere. Two of the four bedrooms are filled with her junk.    If you ask her not to shout, etc. she has a tantrum and then pouts for days.  Giving us the silent treatment in our own house. She also eventually moved into the recliner she saw me buy for myself. She sits around waiting for us to cook her dinner or get takeout. She contributes nothing and fills the house with her clutter and her screaming.\n\nMy biggest problem is my girlfriend just won't admit she messed up with how this was handled.  She says she's unhappy with this too but won't just acknowledge her mistake and apologize.  At some point I've reached my saturation point and have been avoiding them both as much as possible.  I find myself angry all the time and have begun drinking and smoking weed which I rarely ever do.  And never on a Tuesday night.  I'm going to stay with my folks for a week or so just to regain my sanity.  Should I be more tolerant?

I\u2019m only guessing your girlfriend didn\u2019t realize it would be this bad, but you need to have a frank conversation with her and she needs to own up to the situation.  collectively you can come up with a new plan, help her move into a place that she can afford or buy an existing house nearby that also is in her budget.

And while your MiL deserves some grace because she\u2019s moved, she\u2019s grieving, etc. you also deserve to live properly in your own home. She cannot demand meals. She needs to figure out what to do with her stuff. And if she\u2019s yelling at the dog constantly, she needs to ratchet that back big time. You\u2019ve been through nearly half a year of this situation and if your gf is frustrated too, she needs to talk to her mom and figure out what\u2019s going to work for you all.", "NTA\u2014 she\u2019s being awful. As a side note, I\u2019ll give you something to consider; your MIL left her home very suddenly and is grieving. I know because I am going through it with my folks this very minute. I mean\u2026I\u2019m unpacking boxes and taking sanity breaks on Reddit. My parents are grieving the loss of their independent lives, that they miss their old neighbors and friends, they had to downsize, all of it. \n\nIf your MIL is normally a decent person, give her some time. She\u2019s in pain. But if this is pretty much how she always is only dialed to 11 then you and your girlfriend have much bigger issues than just the immediate move. You\u2019re going to all have to live in the same place and this is a very bad start. Take your break, and and think about what your MIL was like before all this.

Unfortunately, without kicking the MIL out, you're pretty much stuck with her behaviours until her in-law suite is built, unless your gf (and you) lay down the law about appropriate behaviour.", "All I can focus on is the MIL suite that's going to be built under the table. That is a TERRIBLE idea. A person willing to do that work on the cheap is likely not insured. What happens if it's built poorly and ends up injuring someone?", "NTA it is past time for sit down and sit some heavy ground rules and do not back down. Perhaps even an ultimatum is in order.", "NTA. Consult a lawyer, you got played. You need to get advice on how to evict the MIL. And if I were you, when I find something of hers she's left strown about I'd simply chuck it out the front door. Eventually she'll get tired of having to go get it or her stuff being ruined.", "NTA.  But seriously, why should you be the one leaving? Tell the both of them that they need to find a motel for a week. Tell your gf that this situation is not sustainable and that she's gonna need to go along with her mother permanently if this isn't fixed.", "NTA\n\nYou have a girlfriend problem.\n\nFigure out how to buy her out, get her name off the deed and get both of them out of there.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA \n\nYou need a come to Jeezus sit down with the two of them to set some groundrules and boundaries (which should have been done the day she moved in)\n\nSince your wife was the sneak here, she should be in charge of enforcement of the rules. Or else start the eviction process \n\nAnd don't have kids", "NTA\n\nYOU really need to discuss this with your GF.  Hopefully you were smart enough not to put her name on your house, since you paid for it with the proceeds from the sale of your residence.\n\nInstead of taking a break, have your GF take herself, mommy, and dog out of the house for a few days on HER dime.\n\nGive yourself time to think if you REALLY want to continue with this relationship.  If you do, then tell her mom is NOT getting a MIL suite, but needs to find a rental of another home for her to move to.  If GF is insistent, then they can find a two bedroom.\n\nSTOP being manipulated and taken advantage of.  Which is exactly what both these women are doing.\n\nIf you really want to go to your folks for a week, perfect opportunity for the move out week.", "NTA. We always can be more tolerant, but this is also a good time to have a family meeting. Let your partner know for your relationship you need an apology and then make some house rules. Temper tantrums be damned set some boundaries and enforce them. Maybe for Christmas somebody needs a two week training away package.", "NTA.
