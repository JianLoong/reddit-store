Mom died 8 years ago. Dad remarried 6 years ago and it was not easy for the three of us. Dad's wife, Rose, has a daughter who's like 11 now. They also have a 4 and 2 year old together. About a week after their wedding, my siblings snuck into my room in the middle of the night, sad about dad being married and the changes that had happened. They asked if I felt like mom really gone now and I said yeah. I asked them if they'd like for us to have something just for us, no new family involved, where we could remember mom and talk about that stuff. They said yes. So I raised the money to buy a pretty nice scrapbook and about once a month my siblings would sneak into my room at night and we'd put photos in and write memories we had and I'd share the stories I remembered of mom, since as the oldest I remembered her best and remembered the stories about her I'd heard. We never added our Rose, our stepsister or our half siblings when they were born. We also didn't talk about it to dad or anyone else. I knew he wouldn't love that we were doing it. I kept it hidden in my room.\n\nThree weeks ago my Rose went through my stuff and found it. She claims she was cleaning up in my room but I know she was snooping because I had it hidden in a place that she wouldn't be cleaning. She went through it, showed my dad, and they sat my siblings and I down and told us that was a really unfair thing to have in the house and how mean it was to do something like that without all the siblings involved. My brother said it was just for the three of us as real siblings. Dad told him that was a shitty attitude and what are our stepsister and half siblings if not real siblings. My sister said it would always be different. Rose said we should never have made something in the home we all shared when it excluded three of our siblings and would hurt feelings. She said we should have done something to bring us all together. My sister said that wasn't what she wanted. My dad sent them out of the room and he and Rose told me I never should have gone along with it and how much it hurt my stepsister when she saw the book and heard what we'd been doing. Rose said it hurt her too. That she tried to make us all one family and we made sure never to close that divide in the last six years. Dad told me he expected better from me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678533827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ohrnd/aita_for_making_a_family_memory_book_with_just_my/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The adults in this situation fail to realize that you having a different mother is not something that will change. That is something that will always hurt the other kids. I would suggest sitting them down and talking. Express first how violated you are about the snooping. You know that for a fact. Then explain while you are happy about your family, your siblings. Talk about what you enjoy about them, doing with them. However that does not mean you all do not miss your mother. She was your MOTHER. And she died. You are honoring her. You are sorry it makes them sad, but it is the job of parents to explain and normalize that part of you. She will always be your mother and always missed.

Yes, you share a mom with your brother and sister, and you should cherish those memories together. I think it's beautiful what you did, and I don't like how your father and Rose handled this at all.

If Rose hadn\u2019t gone through your things open some thing that was none of her business, and then shared it with others. It\u2019s not OK to treat half siblings or step siblings badly, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing.

You were just trying to be a good big brother and muddle through your feelings as best you could.\n\nIt might not be too late for that second scrap book but, either way, I don't think you need to apologise for the first one.\n\nEdit - misgendered OP - sorry!", "It didn't. But I also get what my brother was trying to say and why he didn't have another word for it. The three of us are close and when it comes to siblings, we're closer to each other and love each other and have a bond that we don't have with our stepsister or half siblings. I don't think he could put it into words.

I hope he gives it back eventually.", "Yeah, I think it's something that will always be hard to explain. I know my stepsister will always have a different experience to us because she doesn't remember her life before us and grew up to see us as just siblings (I think) while we always saw her as a stepsister because we had a very different experience. She will likely be closer to our half siblings than we will ever be and them to her, because they'll have a unique dynamic to us. Just like mine and my brother and sister's dynamic is unique to us within the household.", "Answering for me, with the circumstances I have, say minus my siblings but the same events of losing my mom and dad remarrying only remarrying someone with kids. I wouldn't care. I doubt I would feel different than I do now. Though I can't answer if I had been younger and didn't remember mom and life before.", "NTA. You are your siblings lost your mother and this scrapbook is a great way of keeping her memory alive. It's really lovely.\nYour stepmother has the unrealistic expectation that your own mother does not have a place in the story of your combined family.\n\nYour dad is definitely TA for shutting this down. He should be able to make space for you and your siblings to acknowledge and remember your mother.", "There is no indication that OP and birth-siblings are treating her as an outsider. The only thing different is the memory book to their mother, about which she would have been blissfully ignorant forever if not for her own mom's snooping and blabbing. \nIt is not OP's fault that Rose decided to use her to guilt-trip her (Rose's) step-kids.", "Stepsister isn't their sibling, which is a fact; even if they were family, with a 6 yr difference between OP and step, he'd never feel like their sibling and same w large difference in age between siblings and half siblings. They're three distinct groups and pushing the older kids to consider step as a sibling and half as full siblings means it isn't going to happen.\n\nShaming them for keeping alive memories of their mom just means they'll all be NC asap.", "I'm glad someone made this comment. Step mother has gone out of her way to make this a bigger issue.\n\nOP is NTA", "I think it is wrong for the dad and stepmother to be upset. Stepsister gets a pass because of her age. This is a scrapbook of memories of their mother. What memories could stepsistee and the other younger ones even have? The Dad and stepmother should just explain this to the 11 year old, or better still Rose could keep her nose out of things that don't concern her and stop snooping around OP's room.", "We do have family time every few weeks where we're all together doing something.", "Honestly I can't see them doing anything like that but the option is there if they want to. Hopefully they keep the focus on me over the whole thing now and not my siblings.", "No, that's not what we expected. But it was still rough.", "Technically only two of them are. They might be family now but the relationship with my brother and sister will always be closer and the memories of life with our mom will always be something I treasure with them and want to remember.", "But they're not related to his mother.\nThere is nothing wrong with making a something special for the siblings to  remember her.", "Blood means nothing. I would know a little about it. I\u2019m adopted. I have no information about my biological parents, whether I have siblings, or even the time I was born. You can choose your family.", "Big brother, I'm a guy. But yeah. I just wanted something just for us. I knew we'd never get to do that kind of thing more openly but we needed it and it was good for us.", "I hope so too. I think you guys need to come together to talk to your dad. Let him know you guys are working to accept your new family but will not let your old family go. Keep those memories fresh in your mind and don\u2019t stop adding photos. \n\nWho knows, down the road you\u2019ll probably be making memories worth putting in another scrapbook with this family. Getting together to write down the memories in that one. If it seems like something you\u2019re into, maybe make that effort to bridge the gap with the family you have now. This does not mean burning the bridge of memories with your mother.", "That's to be expected, since you were all so young when you lost her. It's hard to lose a parent and to accept the change that comes afterwards. But the reason I ask that is because maybe you should try looking at this from a different POV, not just your own. Maybe walk a mile or two in your dad's shoes and think about how this might be making him feel in regards to your family as a whole.", "Then you need to change what you're calling it. Like....How we were or similar.\n\nI understand what you're saying, but life is fluid, things change, life moves on people come and go, etc. \n\nAre you're not full blood siblings going to see this? Have you considered how much it would hurt them if they did?", "They are related through the father. Why not make it about what's happening now too. \n\nIn case you didn't get it, it's not about the book (because like it or not, the half siblings are family too) it's about the life they had before.", "Sorry - edited!", "I think my dad should support that we will always hold onto the way our family was. Mom was important to all of us, but I think it's easier to move forward and remarry and have a new spouse than it is to accept that your family will grow and change without one of the two most important people in your life, a parent. Of course I get that he probably wanted us to feel as good with his remarrying and to embrace and enjoy the new family he made as just family and see it as only good. I can't blame him if that's what he wanted. But it was different for us in terms of how we experienced it.", "That's why I kept it hidden away. Nobody else was ever meant to say it. It was something to honor the family we would always wish could have remained. Something just for the three of us who lost our mom together, struggled with moving on together and to talk about mom while doing. Never would I have shown it to anyone else or told anyone else about it. But I also never expected Rose to go snooping in my room like she did. Then to talk about it where her daughter could hear.", "So what is wrong with wanting to remember the life they had before? \n\nThey lost their mother. Are they just supposed to forget about her ?", "No problem!", "It's easier for him. He made the decision \n\nYou didn't. Your life was turned upside down when you lost your mum.\n\nThen upended again when he married.", "There is nothing wrong with that at all, but, it could be done better to not basically remove everyone  else. I think the issue may be \"family\" \n\nNevermind. Sometimes I wonder why people post their issues on here.", "How are you not seeing that the other siblings are not related to their mother. They have no memories with their mother. \n\nHow do you add someone in who has no connection?    How do you remove someone who was never there in the first place!"]}
