Mom died 8 years ago. Dad remarried 6 years ago and it was not easy for the three of us. Dad's wife, Rose, has a daughter who's like 11 now. They also have a 4 and 2 year old together. About a week after their wedding, my siblings snuck into my room in the middle of the night, sad about dad being married and the changes that had happened. They asked if I felt like mom really gone now and I said yeah. I asked them if they'd like for us to have something just for us, no new family involved, where we could remember mom and talk about that stuff. They said yes. So I raised the money to buy a pretty nice scrapbook and about once a month my siblings would sneak into my room at night and we'd put photos in and write memories we had and I'd share the stories I remembered of mom, since as the oldest I remembered her best and remembered the stories about her I'd heard. We never added Rose, our stepsister or our half siblings when they were born. We also didn't talk about it to dad or anyone else. I knew he wouldn't love that we were doing it. I kept it hidden in my room.\n\nThree weeks ago my Rose went through my stuff and found it. She claims she was cleaning up in my room but I know she was snooping because I had it hidden in a place that she wouldn't be cleaning. She went through it, showed my dad, and they sat my siblings and I down and told us that was a really unfair thing to have in the house and how mean it was to do something like that without all the siblings involved. My brother said it was just for the three of us as real siblings. Dad told him that was a shitty attitude and what are our stepsister and half siblings if not real siblings. My sister said it would always be different. Rose said we should never have made something in the home we all shared when it excluded three of our siblings and would hurt feelings. She said we should have done something to bring us all together. My sister said that wasn't what she wanted. My dad sent them out of the room and he and Rose told me I never should have gone along with it and how much it hurt my stepsister when she saw the book and heard what we'd been doing. Rose said it hurt her too. That she tried to make us all one family and we made sure never to close that divide in the last six years.

Talk about what you enjoy about them, doing with them. However that does not mean you all do not miss your mother. She was your MOTHER. And she died. You are honoring her. You are sorry it makes them sad, but it is the job of parents to explain and normalize that part of you. She will always be your mother and always missed.

Keep those memories fresh in your mind and don\u2019t stop adding photos. \n\nWho knows, down the road you\u2019ll probably be making memories worth putting in another scrapbook with this family.

This does not mean burning the bridge of memories with your mother.", "That's to be expected, since you were all so young when you lost her. It's hard to lose a parent and to accept the change that comes afterwards. But the reason I ask that is because maybe you should try looking at this from a different POV, not just your own. Maybe walk a mile or two in your dad's shoes and think about how this might be making him feel in regards to your family as a whole.", "Then you need to change what you're calling it. Like....How we were or similar.\n\nI understand what you're saying, but life is fluid, things change, life moves on people come and go, etc. \n\nAre you're not full blood siblings going to see this? Have you considered how much it would hurt them if they did?", "They are related through the father. Why not make it about what's happening now too. \n\nIn case you didn't get it, it's not about the book (because like it or not, the half siblings are family too) it's about the life they had before.", "Sorry - edited!", "I think my dad should support that we will always hold onto the way our family was. Mom was important to all of us, but I think it's easier to move forward and remarry and have a new spouse than it is to accept that your family will grow and change without one of the two most important people in your life, a parent. Of course I get that he probably wanted us to feel as good with his remarrying and to embrace and enjoy the new family he made as just family and see it as only good. I can't blame him if that's what he wanted. But it was different for us in terms of how we experienced it.", "That's why I kept it hidden away. Nobody else was ever meant to say it. It was something to honor the family we would always wish could have remained. Something just for the three of us who lost our mom together, struggled with moving on together and to talk about mom while doing. Never would I have shown it to anyone else or told anyone else about it. But I also never expected Rose to go snooping in my room like she did.

How do you remove someone who was never there in the first place!", "If this was a scrapbook to honour and remember your mother - then there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.

Why would she show her daughter if not to only make her feel more of an outsider while trying to guilt trip you. This is realllllllyyy gross and cruel.

Right now, a large statuette that their stepmother owned sits in the living room in the home I own with my second husband (21 years together and counting).\n\nMy kids' stepmother and I could not stand each other.  But my kids adored her.  She was there all throughout their childhood, and there was an emotional bond there.  So when I got the call that their stepmother was in ICU and dying, I brought the kids over there, because it's where they needed to be, my feelings notwithstanding.  When my daughter couldn't face going into her stepmother's room alone to say goodbye, I went in there with my daughter.  When the wake and funeral were held, I was there as emotional support for my kids.  And when my son went to his dad's old house and helped him clean out the place, my son brought that statuette into my house and asked me if he could put it someplace where he could see it when he left every day.  So there it sits, bold as brass in my living room, a reminder not for me, but for my son.\n\nAnd THAT is the whole point:  grief is a process, and a long and painful one.  Just because I do not personally grieve, it does not mean that my kids do not grieve.  My son has said on a few occasions that he's glad he does not have to hide his grieving from me.  I wouldn't expect him to.  To deny his grief would mean I would be expecting him to move on as if nothing happened, that there was no emotional attachment or shared history there.  Blended families happen, but 'blending' does not mean that you forget those you have loved and lost.  And grieving does not mean you automatically include others who did not even know the person for whom you still grieve.\n\nYou and your full siblings, dear OP, had a history before your dad remarried and had more children with someone else.  Your late mother is someone with whom you share genetics and memories with your siblings, and no one else.  Why would you include half-siblings who did not know your mother?  Your full siblings and you share memories and a bond that the other siblings do not have.  And you all were grieving healthily.\n\nYour stepmother is jealous of/competing with (and trying to utterly eradicate any indication of) a woman who no longer is here, and your father is a willing accomplice in attempting to erase your mother's presence in your hearts.  No, your stepmother is not a \"replacement  mom\", nor can she erase the memories that your siblings and you share.  You should ask your father bluntly if you are supposed to forget your mother ever existed, and when he says no (as any sane adult should), you can then ask him why, then, is he trying to make you participate in activities where your stepmother actively replaces your mom.  When it all comes down to it, before there was Rose, there was your mother, and Rose cannot replace her.\n\nEverything that has happened points to Rose being jealous of your late mother, and wanting the family to continue as a nuclear (original) family, when it is in fact blended in several ways.  She wants \"his\", \"her\", and \"their\" kids to combine into \"our\" kids, but to do that, you would have to forget your mother.  It seems that to Rose, \"bringing the family together\" means that certain family members should forget that other family members ever existed, and that's not how building a family works.  YOu three siblings share a history that the other siblings are not a part of.  THAT part of your life needs to be acknowledged and celebrated, just as the rest of the parts of your life are.  To \"build\" one at the cost of sacrificing the other is unrealistic.", "NTA. This isn't a family scrapbook, it's a memorial book about your mother. Your step sister and half siblings know nothing of her to even be included in the concept. \n\nTBH, I think this says way more about the relationship your father has with you and your full siblings, as you all felt you had to sneak around and hide this.

This is a dynamic that needs to be addressed productively with a professional not on AITA.", "Then I don't think there's anything wrong with a memory book. It should not have hurt anyone's feelings because you have every right to remember your mom and honour her with a book and stories ... She found it snooping but that aside you shouldn't have been made to feel like you had to hide it!\n\nI do think the \" real siblings\" comments are a little archaic and uncalled for you can have room in your life and your heart for your mom and new people... I odvouisly can't speak for your mom as I didn't know her but as a mother I know I would want my children to bond with new siblings and accept everyone equally.\n\nFor both the reasons above I think family counseling could help, I know as a 17 year old that is not your call but maybe you could suggest it", "We see so many instances of blended families where the parents just expect the blending to magical happen. \n\nLike, here OP did a wonderful thing for his siblings, starting at 13 years old! It brought them comfort and helped them cope. \nWhat did father and Rose do, except live together and make more babies?\n\nETA: corrected OP's pronouns", "I've read heartwarming posts where the new parent **does not** expect the kids to \"just move on\" but keeps their mother's memory alive.  Interestingly, the new parent ends up creating their own unique place in the kids' hearts.\n\nHere, I think they need a good family and grief counselor.  And I hope and pray OP's dad and stepmom are truly willing to admit **their** perhaps unintentional contribution to the problem.", "It would always have been a negative that we wanted to do something for just us, something without any steps or halfs, that looked back on our mom and our memories of her and the life we had with her. From the time they got married they wanted family unity.", "If it wouldn\u2019t make matters worse OP Should I ask Rose how she would feel if she (Rose) passed away and her daughter was making a memory book of her and her daughters stepmother made her feel bad for it.", "I disagree, the siblings have no obligation to bond with step or half. They were traumatized by their moms death and dad was more interested in remarrying thsn getting them help, then expects them to bond with extra people and his new family. They won't at this point and shouldn't be expected to. For reasons stated above they wouldn't be a cohesive family group due to ages; trying to force a blended family on traumatized kids is wrong.\n\nThis isn't about innocence or lack thereof, it's about dad and stepmother trying to force relationships. \n\nRose is definitely AH for snooping and dad is AH for keeping scrapbook. If he doesn't return it he has no hope of a continuing relationship with his older kids.", "Have to totally disagree on this. OP was just helping his siblings grieve and honor their mother which he stated he could not do in the open in other comments Because of the attitude of the father and stepmother. They definitely do need family counseling, and any competent counselor would say that what OP and his siblings did was a very healthy thing.", "No Dad needs to walk a mile in OP and his siblings' shoes.  They lost their mother and he wants them to pretend like she never existed.  They created this book to remember her that's it.  The other kids were not involved because they were not a part of OP's mother's life.  He needs to remember that his kids have lost someone very important to them and they have every right in the world to miss her and find ways to remember and honor her.", "That's why it was kept in a secret hiding place. Did you not read the post? The only reason it was found out was because ROSE WAS SNOOPING IN OP'S room.", "It\u2019s hidden. Not like OP is saying it to their faces or posting on their Facebook constantly.\n\nThey\u2019re just trying to remember their mom. Like it or not, the bonds between bio siblings who have lost a parent is often going to be very different than the bonds they have with any future step or half siblings. They\u2019ve been through things together the others won\u2019t, and can\u2019t understand. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nNot all bonds have to be fully equal. Hell I have three sisters, all full bio, and I have different levels of bonds with them. My younger sisters are identical twins and they\u2019re bond with each other is waaaay stronger than any bond either have with myself or our oldest sister.\n\nIt\u2019s really not uncommon for some siblings to be closer and have a deeper relationship than others. But when it comes to blended families suddenly it\u2019s a huge issue.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to change anything, his relationship with his full bio siblings is different from the step/half siblings. And that\u2019s ok. You cannot force bonding", "Why would having a safe space to remember his mom hurt his half-siblings? And if it did it\u2019s an awesome opportunity to teach them about empathy. He should be allowed to have a scrapbook of memories about his mom without it being stolen from him.", "If my math is correct, OP started this when he was 11. Just makes what he did for his younger siblings even more amazing.", "I am so sorry to hear that. I just commented further down in another comment about getting family therapy and grief counseling. Your dad\u2018s attitude is very unhealthy, and obviously hurtful. As a mom of three grown children I\u2019m giving you a virtual hug right now. I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this", "Even if you have a great sense of unity with your second family, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you and your full siblings had a mother, and she sadly died, and you are allowed to remember and honor her and the relationship the three of you had with her.

And might I suggest a yearly event of some kind, maybe on your mothers birthday, just for you guys. For now, maybe something like all going out for ice cream, but maybe something like a trip somewhere in the future.\n\nWhat happened to the scrapbook? Did you get it back?", "NTA. If you haven't yet, PLEASE create an online account and digitize the memory book. Next time, Rose might just throw it away.", "This book was a way for you and your full siblings to process your grief. That's very understandable. \n\nYou kept the book private, which was appropriate to both your grief *and* to the household, since you didn't have any \"space\" where you could have those moments. It sounds like you all needed them.\n\nThe truth is, the three of you share something that no one else in the house *can* be included in, your mother. Your father was her husband, but she was a *mother* to you three, and you three only. You found a way to privately honor that memory.\n\nNo one likes feeling excluded, and their feelings of hurt are also valid, now that everyone knows. They would not feel hurt in the first place if Rose hadn't gone snooping though. You didn't purposefully try to hurt anyone.\n\nINFO: How did the stepsister find out about the book? Rose found it. How was it shared? Leveraging your stepsister's hurt feelings as a guilt trip wasn't fair, since ROSE had to be the one to show it to her.\n\nI think that becoming one family would be more successful if your own memory of your mother and your own grief process were *included*, rather than excluded. You shouldn't have to hide that you miss your mom, even when another maternal figure enters your life. Rose and your father need to realize that even as a new family develops, the family you had before will always have meaning for you.\n\nI think that your family can't truly become \"all one family\" until the memory of your mother is included. You should be able to have private time with memories, and you should be able to share memories openly as well. Your mother lives with you always, and pretending she doesn't is a way of excluding an important part of *you* and her other children.\n\nIt sounds like Rose and your father need some counseling about how to handle this better. They feel threatened, and they need to learn to move forward with love, not with fear.\n\nNTA\n\nETA: I think your memory book is beautiful.", "OP, NTA. 1st. I'd like to give you a big virtual hug for the loss of your precious mom. 2nd. Don't you ever feel like living your mother is ever anything you & your sibling's need to hide or be ashamed of because your step mom's insecure. Where is your step siblings father? Does Rose or your father want them to just pretend he never existed too? Rose is a step mom who stepped into a mothering role to you & your sibling's same as your dad did to your step siblings too. Your relationship with her is different from your biological mom & it always will be. You were blessed to have a good relationship with your mom, both you & your biological siblings. Never forget her & never forget that. It honestly pisses me off that your snoopy ass step mom violated your privacy like that. I could see if it was drugs or alcohol or something dangerous but she way over stepped her role.", "NTA. I get that your dad, Rose and stepsiblings might be hurt. HOWEVER this was not about them but about remembering your mother. Just because you put a scrapbook about mom shouldn\u2019t negate any attachment to Rose and your stepfamily.\n\nI think the question I have is what is the family dynamic of the blended family? Specifically do you resent Rose and all the other siblings who weren\u2019t born to your mom? If you\u2019re not loving and caring to them then this act seems to be a divisive one. That doesn\u2019t make it wrong, in fact I think the scrapbook was a good therapeutic, lovely thing for you guys to do. \n\nYou need to tell your dad that these are your memories and how you all were processing the grief.

It destroyed my brother and I and our relationships with the family. \n\nHaving a secret or unspoken \u201creal\u201d or more important family unit within the actual family unit can be very very harmful to everyone but especially those who are excluded bc of who their parents are/aren\u2019t. \n\nLosing your mom is awful and I completely understand where the need came from and I would hope your dad and stepmom understand that this choice was rooted in coping with deep,  abiding pain and loss also a choice made by children.\n\nMaybe you could make a new scrapbook for the whole family and reframe the existing one as a celebration of your mom but saying that some siblings are \u201creal\u201d family and some are not, is inherently hurtful.", "YTA, but solely for the term \"real siblings.\" I've a lot of half-siblings who grew up with me, like you I've known them from birth.\n\nI cannot stress how badly it would hurt me if they told me they didn't consider me their real siblings.

Keep it out of their house before they destroy it! Good luck** \ud83c\udf40\n\nAgain - NOT TA, y\u2019all are kids who miss their mom. **Anyone who even implies this makes you anything but kids who miss their mom and reacts with anything but sympathy - is honestly sick imho!** Ignore that noise\n\nIt is a beautiful idea, I\u2019ll actually remember it for my younger sibling/s who don\u2019t know our dad. Sorry for your loss. Thank you for this idea! My older siblings and I kept getting stuck on it.", "NTA\n\nBut my reply to your father is\u2026..so you don\u2019t want us to remember Mom and instead want to have her replaced in our memories and heart with another woman.  He will then go \u201cno\u201d or state about moving on and you need to reiterate it was only about remembering MOM. The other sib,in\u2019s don\u2019t matter as they never knew your mom. Your mother was the central focus of it all. Your mother who died and you will get no future memories from her. So you kept it a secret because you guys knew your father wouldn\u2019t want to have you guys remember her but instead move on as a blended family. You can do both but if I were you I\u2019d reiterate it was helping with grieving your mother. And thanks to Rose\u2019s actions and your Dad\u2019s\u2026..they helped prove that point. Rose could have said \u201csweetie you don\u2019t need to hide this from me. It\u2019s okay to remember your mom.  She was amazing and helped create you and your siblings\u2026.etc.\u201d She had a chance to show up as a stepmom but went insecure instead. Your Dad, man I\u2019m mad on your behalf that that is his take. I bet it\u2019s coming from a place of he is happy again and doesn\u2019t want to feel guilt moving on\u2026.but again you *can* move on while remembering/honoring your mother\u2019s memory.\n\nI say this all as someone who lost their mother when I was young. So if my dad had remarried 2 years after she died then I totally would have done something like this too. Because the math as of this post is that from the time your mother died to your father getting remarried is 2 years. Depending on how long they were dating and then engaged (let\u2019s say a year total?) then that is giving the kids 1 year to truly grieve their mom before Dad was with another woman.  If it\u2019s less time for dating and engagement then that\u2019s almost worse, because that showed less transition time and more fast track. What i mean by that is if the relationship escalated quickly, then the kids might have felt forced to go along with the relationship without ever been asked how they feel about the woman. The ages of the kids at that time when their mom died was 11, 8, and 7. So that is a lot of change pretty quickly for young children with something traumatic. So of course young children would want to do something like this to remember.  The sad thing was even at that young age they had to keep it secret from their dad as if remembering their mom was a shameful secret.", "NTA.\n\nYou are allowed to grieve your mother darnit & be sad about what you lost.\n\nMaking a scrapbook is a much healthier, creative outlet for complicated feelings you had cmpared to, say, actually acting mean.\n\nPlus they can't say they were \"excluded\" or that it was a mean act directed at them if they were never supposed to see it.

Your stepmother is very out of line here. It's not her business none of her children, including the ones related to you, had any ties to your mother. Good luck getting this point across.

I have half siblings from my dad's first marriage and they literally do not care that I even exist.  My dad raised me to always care about them and think of them as only my sisters and brothers, not half.  It IS sort of heartbreaking to know that they feel differently about me than how I have always felt about them.  Over time I have learned to just accept it.  I'm 51 and they are all in their 60s.  My mom, dad, and my one sister from both parents are all passed now and I have brothers and sisters who do not even view me as family.  I never hear from them and some, when I see them, only give me a \"Hi.\" and that is all.  \n\nI have five kids from two different marriages (2 from the first and 3 from the second, although it was divorce and not the death of a spouse).   I always feel pain in my heart when I read stories like yours because I know what it is like to some extent to feel like your younger siblings do.  But I also understand how you feel and my heart breaks for your loss as well.  \n\nI made it my primary goal in life to make sure that my two older sons had good strong relationships with their younger siblings.  I nurtured their relationships carefully and thoughtfully.  Luckily they all have good relationships and are quite close (although my daughter and my oldest sharing a bathroom for two years almost imploded our whole house- she was 13).  I wish your father and step-mother would try to find a way, that didn't include guilt, to get you to look at them through more loving eyes.  Your step-mother snooping through your room is less than helpful in this circumstance.  \n\nIf you are open to working on this, and I do believe it would bring more happiness into your life if you were, you should ask for some family counseling with your siblings, dad, and step-mom.  She needs it because she needs to know it was wrong for her to go through your things.  The confrontation your parents had with you is evidence that they do not know how to get through to you.  Maybe they don't have the tools?  Maybe they are the assholes?  What I know for sure is that you are most definitely NTA.  I hope this helps.", "Yes, you are because they are your family to now and you could  just cross them out. That's what I do.", "NTA- first off you should have explained why you made that. If you guys would like to make a family book with all of you in it that would be fine. Just make a separate book. Your dad and your stepmom need to understand that was your coping mechanism with your mother being gone. That's not cool on their part. She should have never showed that to her daughter. They should have just kept that to themselves. She should have never been snooping around your room either. Does she not trust you? But besides all that look them sternly in the eye and say very maturely that that was you guys's coping mechanism with your mother. Say you have no problem making an album with all of the siblings because of course you love your siblings. You should also tell her that it wasn't cool for her to show her daughter that. Then go to your step sister and explain why you made the book. I have a feeling that a child is going to understand that more than those two grown adults. I mean I don't know you guys the situation or anything. But no you're not wrong for making that book for that situation. Now if you made a book and was discluding everybody because you guys wanted to be malicious or something then sure. But you had every right to make that. Please don't feel bad about that. Also I encourage you to go to a bank and buy a lock box and put that book in that lock box. If anybody tries to confiscate that from you go ahead and call the cops. That's real messed up of your dad. You need to have a private conversation with your dad. Then ask her dad if his mother died and he was in that situation how would he feel. Also if he doesn't listen to you please call his mother and ask your grandmother if she died and he made that book and it was that situation how would she feel. Yes sometimes you got to go through all that.", "YTA and YNTA\n\nHere\u2019s my opinion on it:\n\nI think it\u2019s incredible of you to be there emotionally for your siblings. I have yet to lose a bio parent but I did lose my step dad whom I was very close with due to my bio father not being in the picture much. It really sucks. Having an older sibling like yourself to be there and help the younger kids work through their grief with the scrapbook is amazing and it shouldn\u2019t be used as some tool of hatred from your father and step mom. The pain of losing someone never goes away. You just learn to live with it. \n\nYTA in the sense of how you communicated the scrapbook. To basically tell the other siblings that it will never be the same and make them feel like you could never fully love them because they aren\u2019t your \u201creal\u201d siblings is kinda fucked up. It\u2019s not their fault they are in the situation they\u2019re in and knowing that they will never be accepting by someone of their family is incredibly hurtful. Explaining to father and step mom that it was something you wanted to have in order to help keep the memory of your late mother alive and help the younger siblings deal with the insane amount of emotions they must deal with due to losing her would\u2019ve been far more effective in explaining the book instead of turning a cold shoulder to the other siblings and making them feel like they aren\u2019t worthy of your love or considered \u201creal\u201d family.\n\nEdit: also step mom is a nosy jerk who shouldn\u2019t be snooping around your room. You deserve your right to privacy and you deserve your right to the scrapbook.", "The memory book of Mom isn\u2019t what makes you the AH. My guess is that there are things in the book that are after your Mom passed that is excluding your other siblings. I could see that making you a bit of an AH. Also, using the term \u201creal siblings\u201d indicates that you may not look at your other siblings as real family, which saddens me. As someone who grew up in a blended family and is a parent in a blended family it\u2019s not magic and doesn\u2019t just easily work for everyone, but it is important to put effort into. Honestly, if you wanted to remember and celebrate your biological Mom, you shouldn\u2019t have had to hide in in the first place.

The oldest, for a variety of reasons, had a completely different childhood (almost like an only sibling \u2014 it\u2019s a long and complicated story) than the rest of us. The next two were very close in age. They were almost like only siblings. The 4th also had almost an only child experience, or at least a much younger sibling.

Even if you were all fully related by blood, it\u2019s *natural* that you\u2019d feel closer to some than the others.

A different relative\u2019s house. Maybe even a friend\u2019s house if you can. And when you turn 18, get a safety deposit box and store it there.

Needs this safe and I am all for a good cause.", "Like I said, you guys need to seek out some therapy to work through these issues. I hope your relationship with your mom improves.", "I\u2019m not a stepparent, lol.", "I mean, his dad clearly needs it, too. From the sound of things, he never grieved and never wanted his children to do so, either, jumping straight to \u201cfound you a new mom, now let\u2019s all be happy. I SAID BE HAPPY.\u201d", "Every big family has siblings that will bond more with certain siblings and that is ok. Referring to them as the only \"real siblings\" will absolutely hurt other members of the family though and that's not ok. That his brother said that means that they likely need to have more talk with him and try to heal that.\n\nIf they are emotionally struggling with that, then hopefuly that dad and step mom and good enough parents to help them understand their feelings.", "Ah ok, then we agree.", "Probably. Honestly, I can't say exactly what it would be like, because I'm not living it. But I imagine it would be less of a friendship and more of a doting kind of relationship.", "This is such an annoyingly common way for widowers to act. They remarry almost immediately with a variety of excuses that really boil down to \"my wife held me together and now I can't do that work myself\". And then they're like \"hey, this is your new mother! Forget the old one!\"", "No. She isn't his mom. She's his father's wife. Mom is earned.", "You\u2019re such a waste of space. Forcing shit on people over the internet. What a little person you are.", "*stepmom", "Found the stepmom's account. Gross.", "What is your problem?", "My mistake u/yachtr0ck, \"parent in a blended family\", as you [said earlier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ohrnd/aita_for_making_a_family_memory_book_with_just_my/jbtlmyy?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)\n\nMy comment still stands. Quit projecting your insecurities. No two blended families are the same, especially when death is involved.", "Absolutely fair! I was responding mostly to the comment that was talking about the relationship between OP and Rose, and which was implying that OP was the one in need of therapy in that specific relationship - which I strongly disagree with. OP seems to have a good head on his shoulders, and a whole lot of emotional intelligence.\n\nThat said, yeah, dad and Rose need to get therapy and sort themselves out.", "It\u2019s either Rose or some person who had delusions entering a relationship/marriage with someone with kids and expected to replace the other parent. It\u2019s clear as day they have entitlement issues to work out in counseling to understand they\u2019ll never be who they are trying to replace", "Yep agree, they\u2019re doubling down & saying the same thing in every post, almost like they want to taunt op!", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't about excluding siblings so much as keeping your mothers memory alive.\n\nRose, as the stepmother, was out of line by snooping through your private things.  They also seem to be missing the entire purpose of the scrapbook being about your deceased mother and you and your two full blood siblings finding a way through grief.  You weren't rubbing this in anyone's face.  You were grieving with your siblings.  It is unfair of your adult parents to take this away from you and say you have to include your other siblings when they don't like what it is like to lose a parent.  It is devastating. \n\nYou and your other two siblings, 14f and 13m, should be given therapy/grief counseling. The whole family should be given therapy to allow them to navigate the blending of families.  If Rose hadn't shown your private belongings to other people, it wouldn't even be an issue.  Also, you are 17.  You are almost an adult.  It is wrong that Rose is violating your personal boundaries by going through your things. You are allowed personal space and privacy. Going forward, she should not be in your room cleaning. It is your space. Your private belongings.  children should have privacy too, but especially at your age, she should not be going through your stuff. \n\nDefinitely NTA.  They need to understand this is about grief, not exclusion. Their focus is on the wrong thing. And you are allowed to grieve how you need to.", "Absolutely NTA.   I\u2019m having a very hard time not being angry with your father. I saw a comment that he still has the book.  You need to talk with him alone first.  Them Rose can be involved in further discussion.  NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL YOU HOW TO GRIEVE.  \n\nI am sincerely hoping that your dad gives the book back and has a conversation with his wife about going through your belongings.", "NTA\nI'm so sorry you have to deal with this. You should never be shamed or punished for remembering your mother. I don't understand why so many step-parents need to make their relationship primary, above the bio parent.\n\nYour step-mom was out of line going through your possessions, out of line sharing them, and out of line complaining to your dad. At this point they're guaranteeing you and your bio siblings will *never* feel like this is your family and you'll probably avoid holidays and visits home after you move out and are living your lives as adults. I might point that out to your dad - he is creating a situation where his kids are likely looking forward to going no contact. \n\nI hope that you're able to escape safely next year, and take your memory book with you.", "***NTA***, and whilst I understand your stepmom's hurt feelings, she brought it on herself by snooping. You and your siblings have a right to make tangible your memories with your mother. Facts are not negotiable. Your mother existed, and you and your full siblings have every right to want to keep those memories.\n\nBelieve me, I understand the way families can become tangled messes. My mother divorced my dad when I was four, and he remarried when I was about seven. They adopted two children during their seventeen-year marriage, when they divorced. So what do I call my adopted siblings--- step-siblings or half-siblings? They're both! \ud83e\udd23", "NTA your dad sucks hardcore and why did they even show the daughter? what is wrong with them? Also make sure you get the album back and put it in a lockbox. Protect it because who knows what they will do.", "On the topic of different ways to grieve, this seems like a really healthy way. People can give up on all their interests, develop attachment issues, or push people away. \n\nBut instead, these three kids have created a habit of going to a safe space to remember and bond over the positive parts of their mother\u2019s life. And without even involving the dad? If anything, I\u2019d be proud that ya\u2019ll came together to care for each other, and even prouder of the eldest who spear headed all this.\n\nNTA OP, you\u2019re doing a great thing for your siblings. I hope your parents are able to come to their senses", "The real crime here is that the kids feel they have to keep their book and memories secret.  How can he not understand that?  Just because he found a replacement wife doesn't equate to them having a replacement mother.  How would he feel if he had died instead of their mother, and they weren't allowed to openly grieve or discuss him?  If \"new dad\" was mad they didn't want him to replace real dad?  Death of a parent is epic and unparalleled.", "I'd add something about how they started the scrapbook *6 years ago*, when they were 7-11 years old. And ask dad if he's really punishing them now for something they started as young kids, right at the beginning of their new, \"blended\" life. \n\nBecause it sounds like he's not punishing the 17yo OP, he's punishing the 11yo that OP once was.", "I wish I had an award to give. 100% this, well said", "The only reason the stepsister got her feelings hurt is because Rose just had to snoop.", "The original one was a celebration of the mom. And kept secret because of remarks from OP dad and stepmother. \n\nI don\u2019t think they should have to make a new one for the family. If they want one, they can make it. Making a new one does not solve the snooping problem of the stepmother or the problem that the siblings aren\u2019t able to speak openly about their mother.", "The fact OP said \u201cI knew it would probably bother him\u201d is the saddest to be. Kids should have all the freedom and green lights in the world to grieve a parent. That told me so much more than his \u201cexpected better from you\u201d talk.", "Amen! And honestly, I would show dad this post.", "Big time! It's bad enough that the woman was snooping in OP's room to begin with (I never did this to my child at that age) but she's gone and shared the very private item she found with her oldest. What kind of mother does that? I couldn't imagine hurting one of my kids on purpose, especially at the expense of their older step siblings. That is not the way to blend a family. The only thing she's cultivating is a bunch of resentment, hurt, and anger that needn't be there. No wonder OP and his siblings want to hold on to as many of their memories of their mom as they can, their stepmom sounds downright dreadful.", "The audacity for Rose to find this and instantly feel sorry for herself is wild. How could she find it, not feel awful that the kids thought it needed to be hidden in the first place, and not comfort them and tell them they shouldn\u2019t feel bad for remembering their mom? NTA, OP.", "Honestly I don't think it's \"inclusiveness\". To me it feels like an attempt to erase the time before Rose, because it would be more comfortable for Rose and father.", "THIS! op you\u2019re NTA. But get that book out of the house hold before step mother or anyone else does something to damage it, xxx", "Right? That was my parents biggest annoyance with teenagers. Our rooms were a disgusting mess.", "I agree, I'm worried they might lose the scrapbook. It's priceless and irreplaceable. \n\nu/Some-Year-8211 - it's obviously not the same, but maybe get the scrapbook photocopied as a backup?", "\\^ This should be the top comment.  Beautifully said.  NTA OP!  Follow this person's advice, but I would say all this privately to your dad.  I think you will have a better shot of getting the book back.", "I really hope he able to do that, because that book really is a treasure in so many ways. It\u2019s such a gift to his siblings, and him.", "I wonder if stepmom was hoping to find drugs or something in OP's room because I bet her agenda is to push those kids completely out of the picture as soon as she can. But then she found the scrapbook and saw a golden opportunity to undermine them with their dad, playing victim via her daughter as proxy.", "Take it back , if you have any relative from your mom's side nearby - tell him/ her your story and ask them to swear they won't give it to anyone beside you or your siblings. \nAs for your father- sit him down without his wife and plainly ask him: why he denies honouring of the dead wife, your mom and do not protect his kids from their privacy being violated? Tell him this book is not about the living, but the dead member of your family and his lack of respect of your grief is even more dissapointing.", "Right? Why the hell hold hostage a memorial for their Mum? \n\nThis is SO incredibly wrong, I can't even", "i was thinking that even if they didn\u2019t add to it right away, they could still make new entries together and hide them in separate spots so that they wouldn\u2019t be found all at once. then, when op is out of the house, he could add them to the scrapbook with his siblings in private.", "Sweetheart, did they give the book back?\n\nIt's time to talk to an adult that you trust. Explain to them what happened, maybe even show them this post. \n\nYou are *allowed* to honour your mom. You are allowed to share your memories. You are allowed to keep that between you and your mothers other children. This is not something that the rest of your family needs to be included in, your dad and stepmom are wrong.\n\nI'm so sorry they are treating you this way. You don't deserve it.", "This, I also lost a parent at 9 and acquired a stepparent and stepsibling within a couple of years. \n\nKids can feel horribly alone and confused as they try to adapt into a blended family, especially if the new \u2018rules\u2019 are not to acknowledge the dead parent or that life existed beforehand. \n\nOP did a hugely brave thing to help his siblings connect to their lost parent and their past life, and did his best to ensure it didn\u2019t impact the blended family or their rules. He is an amazing brother who will have been a massive help in allowing his siblings to adjust, definitely NTA.", "I agree! The Stepmother is completely TA! She violated OP's privacy, and then caused a seen about not being in a child's memory book of there mother. What did she expect? For them not to be still grieving and missing her? For them to forget about her? How selfish and heartless can this woman be? The dad is TA for going along with her nonsense instead of supporting and trying to understand his children!", "*ante", "I think Mrs. Brady was divorced? I think I remember her ex showing up? Could be wrong.", "This. It took me til I was in my 30s for me to realize how much this fucked me up. At least OP has their siblings to validate each others\u2019 emotions. My older brother was a kid too so he wasn\u2019t to blame really but he definitely picked on me for being emotional too so I just trained myself to keep that hidden from all of them. To the point where I thought I should never show emotion in front of anyone, which really meant keeping myself isolated. OP was/is amazing to give their siblings a safe place to grieve.", "Dad and step are 100% AHs.\n\nStep should *never* have been snooping and definitely should have never shown a child she knew would be hurt by it. She stole and misused their private place to heal together, which is despicable.\n\nShe's the worse one, but dad is also a huge AH for not supporting his children in their grief and taking the thieving step's side.\n\nThese two caused a tremendous amount of pain and permanently damaged the relationships and trust they had with these children. They will never get that relationship back.", "That\u2019s kind of you because I absolutely think dad and stepmom are TAs here.", "> I think I\u2019d be proud to have a son like that (though I don\u2019t have kids so I guess I don\u2019t really know?)\n\nI absolutely would be proud of my kid for stepping up like that for his younger siblings.  Seems like the son got his selflessness from his mom.  He certainly didn't get it from his dad.", "Omg this is horrible!!!!\n\nMake it VERY clear that if ANYTHING happens to it you will not forgive him!!!!!!! Do whatever you can to get it back. If Rose wants to get upset that you \"snoop\" to find it, maybe she will understand why you are upset.\n\n\"Dad I don't get why she is so mad. She did it to us so I thought this was something we could do in this 'family'. Did I misunderstand?\"", "I worry dad won't let him talk to his siblings if he goes NC. So LC might be smarter while his younger siblings are still in the house tbh.", "Yeah you have a point. I guess I'm trying to say OP needs to get the book back using whatever tactics he thinks will work, which might include stretching the truth or lying. I think it's too important to him and his siblings to lose.\n\nI guess if it's protecting siblings or the book, siblings come first, but they put years into that book and memories of their mom. \n\nUnfortunately it seems that dad chose Rose over their kids. I think all OP can do is try to get out, do as well as he possibly can and hope to support his siblings when their time to turn 18 and get out comes!"]}
