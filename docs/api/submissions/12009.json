Mom died 8 years ago. Dad remarried 6 years ago and it was not easy for the three of us. Dad's wife, Rose, has a daughter who's like 11 now. They also have a 4 and 2 year old together. About a week after their wedding, my siblings snuck into my room in the middle of the night, sad about dad being married and the changes that had happened. They asked if I felt like mom really gone now and I said yeah. I asked them if they'd like for us to have something just for us, no new family involved, where we could remember mom and talk about that stuff. They said yes. So I raised the money to buy a pretty nice scrapbook and about once a month my siblings would sneak into my room at night and we'd put photos in and write memories we had and I'd share the stories I remembered of mom, since as the oldest I remembered her best and remembered the stories about her I'd heard. We never added our Rose, our stepsister or our half siblings when they were born. We also didn't talk about it to dad or anyone else. I knew he wouldn't love that we were doing it. I kept it hidden in my room.\n\nThree weeks ago my Rose went through my stuff and found it. She claims she was cleaning up in my room but I know she was snooping because I had it hidden in a place that she wouldn't be cleaning. She went through it, showed my dad, and they sat my siblings and I down and told us that was a really unfair thing to have in the house and how mean it was to do something like that without all the siblings involved. My brother said it was just for the three of us as real siblings. Dad told him that was a shitty attitude and what are our stepsister and half siblings if not real siblings. My sister said it would always be different. Rose said we should never have made something in the home we all shared when it excluded three of our siblings and would hurt feelings. She said we should have done something to bring us all together. My sister said that wasn't what she wanted. My dad sent them out of the room and he and Rose told me I never should have gone along with it and how much it hurt my stepsister when she saw the book and heard what we'd been doing. Rose said it hurt her too. That she tried to make us all one family and we made sure never to close that divide in the last six years.

Talk about what you enjoy about them, doing with them. However that does not mean you all do not miss your mother. She was your MOTHER. And she died. You are honoring her. You are sorry it makes them sad, but it is the job of parents to explain and normalize that part of you. She will always be your mother and always missed.

Step mother has gone out of her way to make this a bigger issue.\n\nOP is NTA", "I think it is wrong for the dad and stepmother to be upset. Stepsister gets a pass because of her age.

Hopefully they keep the focus on me over the whole thing now and not my siblings.", "No, that's not what we expected. But it was still rough.", "Technically only two of them are.

Keep those memories fresh in your mind and don\u2019t stop adding photos. \n\nWho knows, down the road you\u2019ll probably be making memories worth putting in another scrapbook with this family.

This does not mean burning the bridge of memories with your mother.", "That's to be expected, since you were all so young when you lost her. It's hard to lose a parent and to accept the change that comes afterwards. But the reason I ask that is because maybe you should try looking at this from a different POV, not just your own. Maybe walk a mile or two in your dad's shoes and think about how this might be making him feel in regards to your family as a whole.", "Then you need to change what you're calling it. Like....How we were or similar.\n\nI understand what you're saying, but life is fluid, things change, life moves on people come and go, etc. \n\nAre you're not full blood siblings going to see this? Have you considered how much it would hurt them if they did?", "They are related through the father. Why not make it about what's happening now too. \n\nIn case you didn't get it, it's not about the book (because like it or not, the half siblings are family too) it's about the life they had before.", "Sorry - edited!", "I think my dad should support that we will always hold onto the way our family was. Mom was important to all of us, but I think it's easier to move forward and remarry and have a new spouse than it is to accept that your family will grow and change without one of the two most important people in your life, a parent. Of course I get that he probably wanted us to feel as good with his remarrying and to embrace and enjoy the new family he made as just family and see it as only good. I can't blame him if that's what he wanted. But it was different for us in terms of how we experienced it.", "That's why I kept it hidden away. Nobody else was ever meant to say it. It was something to honor the family we would always wish could have remained. Something just for the three of us who lost our mom together, struggled with moving on together and to talk about mom while doing. Never would I have shown it to anyone else or told anyone else about it. But I also never expected Rose to go snooping in my room like she did. Then to talk about it where her daughter could hear.", "So what is wrong with wanting to remember the life they had before? \n\nThey lost their mother. Are they just supposed to forget about her ?", "No problem!", "It's easier for him. He made the decision \n\nYou didn't. Your life was turned upside down when you lost your mum.\n\nThen upended again when he married.", "There is nothing wrong with that at all, but, it could be done better to not basically remove everyone  else.

They have no memories with their mother. \n\nHow do you add someone in who has no connection?    How do you remove someone who was never there in the first place!", "If this was a scrapbook to honour and remember your mother - then there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Also, you did this to help your siblings who missed their biological mom. \n\nAs long as everyone is putting their best foot forward to try and be a family - have a memento of your mom is totally fine. \n\nYour stepmom is not endearing herself by snooping through your stuff and guilting you.

Why would she show her daughter if not to only make her feel more of an outsider while trying to guilt trip you. This is realllllllyyy gross and cruel.

However, your stepmom and your dad are denying your siblings and you the actual grief process and calling their actions \"okay\".  No, it's not okay, not by any means.  Kids have to grieve, especially when it's the loss of a parent.\n\nI'm going to let you in on how grief was handled in my home.  After my ex and I divorced, my kids' father remarried, and after over a decade, that woman (my kids' stepmother) killed herself.  Right now, a large statuette that their stepmother owned sits in the living room in the home I own with my second husband (21 years together and counting).\n\nMy kids' stepmother and I could not stand each other.  But my kids adored her.  She was there all throughout their childhood, and there was an emotional bond there.  So when I got the call that their stepmother was in ICU and dying, I brought the kids over there, because it's where they needed to be, my feelings notwithstanding.  When my daughter couldn't face going into her stepmother's room alone to say goodbye, I went in there with my daughter.  When the wake and funeral were held, I was there as emotional support for my kids.  And when my son went to his dad's old house and helped him clean out the place, my son brought that statuette into my house and asked me if he could put it someplace where he could see it when he left every day.  So there it sits, bold as brass in my living room, a reminder not for me, but for my son.\n\nAnd THAT is the whole point:  grief is a process, and a long and painful one.  Just because I do not personally grieve, it does not mean that my kids do not grieve.  My son has said on a few occasions that he's glad he does not have to hide his grieving from me.  I wouldn't expect him to.  To deny his grief would mean I would be expecting him to move on as if nothing happened, that there was no emotional attachment or shared history there.  Blended families happen, but 'blending' does not mean that you forget those you have loved and lost.  And grieving does not mean you automatically include others who did not even know the person for whom you still grieve.\n\nYou and your full siblings, dear OP, had a history before your dad remarried and had more children with someone else.  Your late mother is someone with whom you share genetics and memories with your siblings, and no one else.  Why would you include half-siblings who did not know your mother?  Your full siblings and you share memories and a bond that the other siblings do not have.  And you all were grieving healthily.\n\nYour stepmother is jealous of/competing with (and trying to utterly eradicate any indication of) a woman who no longer is here, and your father is a willing accomplice in attempting to erase your mother's presence in your hearts.  No, your stepmother is not a \"replacement  mom\", nor can she erase the memories that your siblings and you share.  You should ask your father bluntly if you are supposed to forget your mother ever existed, and when he says no (as any sane adult should), you can then ask him why, then, is he trying to make you participate in activities where your stepmother actively replaces your mom.  When it all comes down to it, before there was Rose, there was your mother, and Rose cannot replace her.\n\nEverything that has happened points to Rose being jealous of your late mother, and wanting the family to continue as a nuclear (original) family, when it is in fact blended in several ways.  She wants \"his\", \"her\", and \"their\" kids to combine into \"our\" kids, but to do that, you would have to forget your mother.  It seems that to Rose, \"bringing the family together\" means that certain family members should forget that other family members ever existed, and that's not how building a family works.  YOu three siblings share a history that the other siblings are not a part of.  THAT part of your life needs to be acknowledged and celebrated, just as the rest of the parts of your life are.  To \"build\" one at the cost of sacrificing the other is unrealistic.", "NTA. This isn't a family scrapbook, it's a memorial book about your mother. Your step sister and half siblings know nothing of her to even be included in the concept. \n\nTBH, I think this says way more about the relationship your father has with you and your full siblings, as you all felt you had to sneak around and hide this. Clearly your mother is never mentioned, even when your step/ half family is not around. He may have reasons for this, but he has no right to dictate your feelings on the matter. \n\nYour step mother has definitely overstepped.

I odvouisly can't speak for your mom as I didn't know her but as a mother I know I would want my children to bond with new siblings and accept everyone equally.\n\nFor both the reasons above I think family counseling could help, I know as a 17 year old that is not your call but maybe you could suggest it", "We see so many instances of blended families where the parents just expect the blending to magical happen. \n\nLike, here OP did a wonderful thing for his siblings, starting at 13 years old! It brought them comfort and helped them cope. \nWhat did father and Rose do, except live together and make more babies?\n\nETA: corrected OP's pronouns", "I've read heartwarming posts where the new parent **does not** expect the kids to \"just move on\" but keeps their mother's memory alive.  Interestingly, the new parent ends up creating their own unique place in the kids' hearts.\n\nHere, I think they need a good family and grief counselor.  And I hope and pray OP's dad and stepmom are truly willing to admit **their** perhaps unintentional contribution to the problem.", "It would always have been a negative that we wanted to do something for just us, something without any steps or halfs, that looked back on our mom and our memories of her and the life we had with her. From the time they got married they wanted family unity.", "If it wouldn\u2019t make matters worse OP Should I ask Rose how she would feel if she (Rose) passed away and her daughter was making a memory book of her and her daughters stepmother made her feel bad for it.", "I disagree, the siblings have no obligation to bond with step or half. They were traumatized by their moms death and dad was more interested in remarrying thsn getting them help, then expects them to bond with extra people and his new family. They won't at this point and shouldn't be expected to. For reasons stated above they wouldn't be a cohesive family group due to ages; trying to force a blended family on traumatized kids is wrong.\n\nThis isn't about innocence or lack thereof, it's about dad and stepmother trying to force relationships. \n\nRose is definitely AH for snooping and dad is AH for keeping scrapbook. If he doesn't return it he has no hope of a continuing relationship with his older kids.", "Have to totally disagree on this. OP was just helping his siblings grieve and honor their mother which he stated he could not do in the open in other comments Because of the attitude of the father and stepmother. They definitely do need family counseling, and any competent counselor would say that what OP and his siblings did was a very healthy thing.", "No Dad needs to walk a mile in OP and his siblings' shoes.  They lost their mother and he wants them to pretend like she never existed.  They created this book to remember her that's it.  The other kids were not involved because they were not a part of OP's mother's life.  He needs to remember that his kids have lost someone very important to them and they have every right in the world to miss her and find ways to remember and honor her.", "That's why it was kept in a secret hiding place. Did you not read the post? The only reason it was found out was because ROSE WAS SNOOPING IN OP'S room.", "It\u2019s hidden. Not like OP is saying it to their faces or posting on their Facebook constantly.\n\nThey\u2019re just trying to remember their mom. Like it or not, the bonds between bio siblings who have lost a parent is often going to be very different than the bonds they have with any future step or half siblings. They\u2019ve been through things together the others won\u2019t, and can\u2019t understand. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nNot all bonds have to be fully equal. Hell I have three sisters, all full bio, and I have different levels of bonds with them. My younger sisters are identical twins and they\u2019re bond with each other is waaaay stronger than any bond either have with myself or our oldest sister.\n\nIt\u2019s really not uncommon for some siblings to be closer and have a deeper relationship than others. But when it comes to blended families suddenly it\u2019s a huge issue.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to change anything, his relationship with his full bio siblings is different from the step/half siblings. And that\u2019s ok. You cannot force bonding", "Why would having a safe space to remember his mom hurt his half-siblings? And if it did it\u2019s an awesome opportunity to teach them about empathy. He should be allowed to have a scrapbook of memories about his mom without it being stolen from him.", "If my math is correct, OP started this when he was 11. Just makes what he did for his younger siblings even more amazing.", "I am so sorry to hear that. I just commented further down in another comment about getting family therapy and grief counseling. Your dad\u2018s attitude is very unhealthy, and obviously hurtful. As a mom of three grown children I\u2019m giving you a virtual hug right now. I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this", "Even if you have a great sense of unity with your second family, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you and your full siblings had a mother, and she sadly died, and you are allowed to remember and honor her and the relationship the three of you had with her. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and for this unkindness on the part of your dad and stepmom.", "NTA\u2014- family unity is better achieved when all members of the family are treated respectfully and as individuals.\nRose did not respect your privacy, your dad is not respecting your grief.   It is a shame that you even felt you had to hide this book.", "It\u2019s so sad that you seem to be so much more mature than the adults in questions. You recognize and understand your dad\u2019s feelings, and the reasons behind it so well. Your dad and his wife are failing you, and I wish they had anywhere near your level of emotional maturity.\n\nThey seem to be thinking of everyone\u2019s feelings but yours and your bio sibs.", "It\u2019s a scrapbook of their mother, not a scrapbook of their entire family. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that; I have scrapbooks for each of my kids, but that doesn\u2019t mean that when they\u2019re looking through Kid 3\u2019s book that Kid 1 doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nI\u2019d say the best thing would be for OP\u2019s parents to start a scrapbook of their family story - how their family came to be and how it is now. Then stepmom could make one with Rose about *their* previous family stories, and they can bring dad into helping with the current scrapbook. 3 books, 3 chapters in their lives."]}
