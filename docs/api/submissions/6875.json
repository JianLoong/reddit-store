She was crying as said she needed a shower because she had puked over her bed and herself. I told her to go back to bed and we would deal with it in the morning. She protested and cried a bit more. I asked her if she had eaten too much candy, and she said no. I once again told her to go back to bed and she left the room. \n\nMy wife got up out of bed at that point and I heard her in the hallway talking with her. I then heard the shower start. I could hear my wife gagging (she has a weak stomach around puke) and after a while I could tell she wasn\u2019t coming back to bed. I got up, and saw that she was cleaning up the bed and stripping the sheets - my daughter was still in the shower. \n\nMy wife was short with me when I asked her what she was doing. When my daughter got out of the shower, my wife offered to lie down in the basement with her so she could be close to a bathroom. I helped them get out floor mats to sleep on. \n\nWhen grabbing a pillow my wife told me she was disappointed in my \u201cdisgusting lack of empathy\u201d. Now I am laying awake in bed alone. \n\n\nSome points to consider I think is that this isn\u2019t the first time my daughter has vomited in her bed at night. She doesn\u2019t seem to take feeling ill seriously and get herself to a toilet in time - which she is old enough to do. \nLast time she vomited was right after Halloween when she devoured all of her candy and ended up throwing it all up because of how sick she made herself. \n\nI believe having to go back to bed may have helped her learn her lesson on these issues.\nAITA for telling her to go back to bed?\n\n\nEDIT: I think people are assuming the worst here. She was not \u201ccovered in vomit\u201d, she had some in her hair. And I didn\u2019t realize how bad the bed was when I told her to go back to bed.

She was crying as said she needed a shower because she had puked over her bed and herself. I told her to go back to bed and we would deal with it in the morning. She protested and cried a bit more. I asked her if she had eaten too much candy, and she said no. I once again told her to go back to bed and she left the room. \n\nMy wife got up out of bed at that point and I heard her in the hallway talking with her. I then heard the shower start. I could hear my wife gagging (she has a weak stomach around puke) and after a while I could tell she wasn\u2019t coming back to bed. I got up, and saw that she was cleaning up the bed and stripping the sheets - my daughter was still in the shower. \n\nMy wife was short with me when I asked her what she was doing. When my daughter got out of the shower, my wife offered to lie down in the basement with her so she could be close to a bathroom. I helped them get out floor mats to sleep on. \n\nWhen grabbing a pillow my wife told me she was disappointed in my \u201cdisgusting lack of empathy\u201d. Now I am laying awake in bed alone. \n\n\nSome points to consider I think is that this isn\u2019t the first time my daughter has vomited in her bed at night. She doesn\u2019t seem to take feeling ill seriously and get herself to a toilet in time - which she is old enough to do. \nLast time she vomited was right after Halloween when she devoured all of her candy and ended up throwing it all up because of how sick she made herself. \n\nI believe having to go back to bed may have helped her learn her lesson on these issues.\nAITA for telling her to go back to bed?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He\u2019s either a robot or the most self absorbed and least empathetic person alive", "Not only a lack of empathy but also lacking in knowledge.\n\nA 10 year old their stomach isn't big/and deep enough to hold it in.\n\nThe \"teaching her a lesson\" is what for instance cognitive impaired parents do to their crying babies, because they simply can't comprehend the physical & mental development stages of children.\n\nYTA your lack of empathy maybe inherited & but there is no reason to stay ignorant.", "He deleted the post... anyone have a screenshot?", "I made my comment before the edit. And the edit OP posted almost makes it worse IMO.\n\nOh her hair was just a little crusty? That\u2019s fine! And oh my gosh I didn\u2019t realize the state of her bed because I was too lazy to get up and take care of my obviously sick daughter!! Totally not my fault!! /s\n\nEdit me as a full grown adult, if I have a stomach bug and it hits overnight, sometimes I\u2019m not making it. It\u2019s insane he expects his 10 year old to intuit that something\u2019s very wrong, get up, and quickly make that sprint to the bathroom. Most of us as grownups know and understand that urgent sprint, but I\u2019ve puked in the hallway before when I wake up super sick.", "RIGHT? I'm astounded. Dumbfounded. Blown away. I'm almost 40yo mom with a 10yo kid. I can't understand what kind of a saint OP married for the wife to be \"only\" that angry.

Kid comes in and tells you they were sick in bed, you deal with it. Kid in shower, sheets changed, the lot.", "Exactly.  Like if there is just a little bit of dog shit in your cornflakes I don\u2019t see you eating around it.", "But it would have taught the 10 y.o. a lesson!!!!!  To call him the AH is an understatement.", "Even if she\u2019s just being stubborn to \u201cmake a point\u201d, her point is right, you\u2019re a shitty father and husband. Take some time to self reflect, you\u2019re completely in the wrong here, go apologize and make it right!!", "Was the point she\u2019s trying to make \u201cbe a good parent?\u201d Because you\u2019re sure as hell missing it if it is.", "Are you ok ??? I can\u2019t believe you can\u2019t see what you did wrong. You\u2019re a major AH. Smh. Just horrible.", "This. I can\u2019t believe you were too lazy to wake up and check on a room that has a bed w/vomit on it. If the room smelled that bad after only a few mins/hour, imagine if you had allowed it to stay that way till morning. That room may stay in her room permanently and permeate onto walls, her carpet or flooring, her stuff etc. It would\u2019ve be so much harder & a pain to deal w/in the long run instead of just an hour that night. You think you\u2019re teaching her a lesson by sending her back to her room but you\u2019re the one that will be taught a lesson if you had to deal w/a an enclosed vomit filled room that has been fermenting for hours.", "She needs to be stubborn and make the point that you absolutely cannot treat your daughter so callously. Good mama, protecting and standing up for her daughter. That\u2019s your job, too. You missed the mark today. \n\nI suggest genuinely asking yourself (and perhaps your wife) if this is an isolated incident or if you have a habit of treating your child without kindness and empathy.", "INFO: WTF is wrong with you?", "Oh my goodness, sleeping with the smell of vomit is not so bad /s\n\nYou're ridiculous", "Your comments aren\u2019t doing you any favors. I sincerely hope your daughter when the time comes puts you in the shittiest retirement home she can find.", "How about you go sleep in the vomit room & give them your bed? The point is that she's an actual caring parent & you're a lazy AH who thinks making their child lay in vomit is a good lesson. Newsflash: That's abuse. Even if it's only once, it's still abusive & never should have entered your mind as an option.", "Or she cannot stand to be around you. You\u2019ve proven your indifference.", "Are you okay, do you need help? Sending a kid sleep on a vomit covered bed could be a form of abuse in some countries i think. And if she was sleeping, then woke up to vomit, she maybe tried to stand up to go to the toilet but didn't manage to hold it and vomited on the bed because she literally couldn't make it to the bathroom.", "Next time, \u201cDad,\u201d how about YOU go sleep in your daughter\u2019s vomit-soaked sheets? Or even, after your wife strips the bed and cleans up, on a mat on the floor of her vomit-perfumed room? Then decide if your wife made the correct move.", "The point is YTA. And a shit parent. And a shit partner.", "I wonder how your wife is still married to you, she really needs an award for keeping up with your shit", "Says the guy who wanted to force his daughter to sleep in puke.", "Had the same wake up from my 9y old tonight. Took her hand and told her it would be ok. Woke mommy up that took her to shower and get cleaned while I sorted the bedroom. She came out nice and clean to a warm bed, we gave her some medication to settle the stomach. I sat down next to her running my fingers through her hair rubbing her head to calm her and make sure she gets back to sleep ok. While still making sure she's ok I'm scrolling through my phone and reading what kind of sperm donor you are. It's not about being a good father, it's about being a good human being. YTA", "If my cat vomits, i instantly get up and try to fix everything and comfort my cat.", "This makes it even worse.\n\nHow could you think this was ok?", "And yet there you were wanting to blame your poor daughter and make her sleep in puke to \u201cteach her a lesson.\u201d WAKE UP. YTA YTA YTA", "I don\u2019t see how that makes any difference\u2026who cares why she had to vomit\u2026candy or croissant. You don\u2019t tell your 10 year old daughter to go back to her bed and sleep in her vomit!", "No matter what the reason for the vomit is, you do not let someone you care about go back to sleep after vomiting without **getting up to help them / check on them / making sure they sleep in a safe position**. \n\nDid you not know that people can choke on their vomit in their sleep and die? Do you even care about your daughter at all? You literally rolled over and said deal with it yourself. Did not even get out of bed. This is despicable parenting.", "Wtf dude, you\u2019re still looking for a legitimate reason to trust that her vomit wasn\u2019t \u201cher fault\u201d rather than just take care of your kid. \n\nI grew up with a parent like this and I can tell you how your kid will feel about you later in life. Spoiler: not great. I used to puke in bed all the time, like the commenter above. I\u2019d wake up puking, or I\u2019d throw up in my sleep, straight into my pillowcase. If I realized I was throwing up, I\u2019d get up and start stripping my sheets because I learned early on there was no sympathy waiting in my parents room. If I woke them up with the sound of cleaning, they\u2019d get up and yell at me for making noise and tell me to go back to bed. But even they didn\u2019t try to gaslight me into thinking getting sick was my fault, jfc that\u2019s next level", "Why are you reflecting more on what made your daughter sick and not why you told your sick daughter to leave you alone", "Who knows, if you\u2019d bothered to ask your child, rather than telling her to go back to her vomited covered bed, maybe you\u2019d have some idea? It\u2019s almost like if you actually cared about your child, you might be able to find these things out.", "Stop trying to find excuses. The why she puked does not matter when she is crying with puke in her hair and on her bed. That I'd the time to man up, get her clean, clean her bed, and be a decent parent. You couldn't do one thing right. The only thing you did was everything wrong. I find it hard to believe you care for her one bit.", "Why haven't you gotten your daughter tested for it? I commented to take her to a doctor to rule out medical stuff before I even saw your comment about the family history.", "Well the only way to find our is to have your wife do all the work of parenting since you can't be bothered. And BTW you're edit about the \"vat\" of vomit--you did in fact insist your child go back and lay in a pool of vomit.", "Agreed. I feel sorry for anyone who has to live with OP.", "Too late to save the foot, but not too late to save the leg.", "Never too late to file for divorce", "Was hoping there was some even vaguely compelling reason for your action.\nStill monstrous AH.", "I'm sure your CHILD wanted to go back to sleep too instead learning what a cold, heartless AH her father is", "So you were too tired to be a parent, grow up. You chose to be a parent. You're their parent 24/7, not just when it's convenient for you. I feel sad for your daughter having to grow up with you as a father.", "You make me sick.. I hope your wife divorces you.. God forbid having to lose sleep to help your child.", "So you were more worried about yourself than your sick child. My dad worked 70+hr weeks & never once did he ignore one of us when we were sick because he was groggy & wanted to go back to sleep. You have no excuse for your behavior & need to learn some empathy while being a better parent.", "And your sick daughter jsut wanted her Dad to look after her. You signed up for middle of the night care when you had a kid. You wanting sleep is no excuse for child neglect. \nYou didn\u2019t even check her bed for vomit before telling her to go sleep in it. \nWhat a lousy excuse for a father you are. YTA. There is no excuse for your behaviour. You a\nHound have slept in her vomit soaked bed while she slept in your bed with your wife, since you deemed it so acceptable.", "After reading your last post and comments on it, it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re just a lazy parent. You only think of yourself and you see being a active member of the family/a parent as a inconvenience.

How could an adult who I assume has overindulged at least once have no compassion for a child even if they did eat too much candy (but doesn\u2019t even know for sure???)!", "Yeah, dude.\nThat's been true every time every kid wakes a parent up for any reason ever\n\nVomit and.shit are never \"we'll take care of it in the morning\" situations.\n\nThis is so true people make not-really-kidring jokes about the most effective ringtone to use if you struggle is cat or child vomiting.

So many times I've had that feeling in my gut, knowing that the vomit was coming. Sometimes it's sudden, and somehow that's better. But during that horrible time between knowing that it's going to happen and it actually happening... it's almost worse than the vomiting itself", "Ours is a puke pot because we like the alliteration. \nWe had to be replaced recently.

My husband usually realizes too late he has to vomit. He\u2019ll literally go \u201cI have to vomit\u201d and immediately vomit.
