Me and my husband have 2 kids (16 and 13). Elina's staying with us for 4 months because she started at a new college, and she needs some time to sort out housing. She's been here for a couple of weeks so far, last night she made dinner for everyone (she said she wanted to).\n\nThe way dinner usually works in my household is I dish up the food, then my kids take it to their rooms to eat. We obviously have family dinner too, but this is just more convenient for all of us as we don't have to spend time setting the table every day, and we can eat at different times if needed (also by different times I don't mean someone eats at 7 pm and someone eats at 3 am, just a small gap).\n\nI know this isn't for everyone and that's okay, but this is what works for our family. Elina knows this.\n\nSo last night she made fried dumplings, orange chicken, fried rice and chocolate cake for dessert. I went into the kitchen to thank her and saw her setting the table. I told Elina she doesn't need to do that and we'll take food from the pot.\n\nMy 13 yo started saying she was hungry so I went to get food since everything was done, but Elina stopped me and said to wait a few minutes and we'll eat together. Again I told her that's not how it really works here, one of my kids is hungry now, but my 16 yo usually eats a bit later.\n\nElina then said she was going to serve the dumplings first, then chicken and rice and cake after. I repeated to her, again, we can get the main food at once, cake later and if anyone wants seconds we'll come and get it, it's fine, no need to set the table.\n\nShe looked upset and said she wants to have a 'nice dinner together' and 'involve the kids'. I had enough at this point so I told her I know my kids and family, she doesn't have to dictate what we do on my home. My husband saw what was going on and told Elina thanks, but we know how to serve ourselves.\n\nElina eventually understood but she was acting sulky, and giving me the cold shoulder this morning.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675255494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qtu86/aita_for_saying_my_sister_doesnt_have_to_dictate/", "score": 477, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister made a three course meal and wanted to eat together. Would it be such a big deal to break the disjointed meal time tradition just once? Tell her i\u2019ll sit at the table and eat all that.", "YTA\nThis was her way of showing appreciation, to you and your family. And you kinda threw it back in her face.\nAlso, your teaching your children some really bad habits with eating. They'll carry this behavior on, and that will cause issues for them in the future with most outside your walls.\nFamily meal times are an important part of growing up and understanding social situations.", "YTA, you and your husband. You're completely ungrateful for what your sister was trying to do for you all and I expect she was greatly upset. Are you always so insensitive? Sounds to me that the dinner arrangements your sister made is exactly what you lot need. Do you all hate being together so much that you can't cope with having even one meal together? This has to be one of the more pathetic AITA posts I've read for a while.", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't sound like Elina was trying to dictate what y'all do 365 days of the year - She just wanted to have one somewhat nice sitdown dinner together.   Instead of asking her if that was the plan, you jumped down her throat and then sicced your husband on her as well.", "YTA\n\nYou're right in that she can't dictate what you do in your own home. If she was insisting you sit down at the table for dinner every night, then I could see your point. I don't really agree with the whole 'eat whenever you want, alone' thing but you do you.\n\nThe reason you're an AH is because this was one time she wanted everyone to sit together and eat a 3 course meal. She worked hard to make dinner for everyone and wanted to eat with all of you. You couldn't have granted her that? Instead you went off at her. Your 13 year old couldn't wait a few more minutes? Your 16 year old couldn't eat a little earlier just for one night after her aunt worked hard to make a delicious meal for you?\n\nAnd it's not even like she was asking you to set the table for her. She was doing it herself. Seriously OP, what would the harm have been in just eating dinner together for one night?", "Edit: YTA \n\nPossibly unpopular based on the other comments currently, but: \n\nI think I'll go N.A.H, but it could easily be Y.T.A. It depends on the communication surrounding this. Was your sister communicating about how she wanted dinner to go prior to starting to make it, or did she spring this on your family right as she finished dinner with no further context KNOWING (presumably) how your family usually handles dinner? \n\nIf she communicated her desires about dinner beforehand, Y.T.A.\n\nIf she didn't, I'd go N.T.A/N.A.H. She's not an AH for wanting to show appreciation, but her delivery could have been better if she had communicated the expectations beforehand (if she didn't).\n\nEdit: Verdict based on OP reply to this.", "YTA. \n\nIt sounds like your sister put a lot of thought into the meal and wanted to enjoy it with your family. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine slaving away in the kitchen and not getting to reap the benefit of seeing people enjoy what I\u2019ve cooked. It\u2019s the whole damn point.", "YTA- She made the dinner and wanted to serve it family style ONE TIME. You couldn\u2019t show appreciation for her and have everyone sit together just this once?", "It's so sad that your family is so scattered around rooms.. Do your children even have social skills? Why do you hate each other so much? Overall just sad. Poor sister. I wouldn't do anything at all in your house, wouldn't ever again lift my finger if I were her.\nOh, and yes, YTA.", "YTA - she made a special dinner for the family - there was no reason you couldn't have all sat around the table this one time.\n\nMaybe a bit of miscommunication here, but that was obviously what she thought would happen when she made something special for the family.", "YTA. Both you and your husband. It takes like what? 30 minutes to sit down and eat together?", "YTA.      Your sister made a nice meal that was meant to be an affair, not shoveling food into your tasting hole while huddling in your bedroom like Gollum.     \n\n\nIt sounds like everyone was home.    \"Catch as you can\" is for the nights when one kid has scouts and the other kid has practice, and a parent has to stay late at work to meet a deadline.     \n\n\nNot only were you and your husband grossly disrespectful to your sister, you're teaching  your kids to be inconsiderate as well.", "YTA only on Reddit does a nice gesture get seen as a power move to dictate what other people do.\n\nEating separately in your rooms is weird. Most people prioritize some sort of family dinner at least sporadically, so idk why this was so difficult for you and your husband to just do once. And even if it was unusual and weird for you, the way you two responded to her was aggressive and odd.", "YTA.\n\nYour sister was trying to do something nice and have some family time with everyone but you proceeded to stick with tradition and \"my house, my rules.\" You do realize that your personal family tradition and rules should typically change when a guest is over, right? She wasn't asking for you to throw out your whole routine forever, she asked for one family dinner that she made herself and you refused.\n\nAH.", "YTA. She cooks you all what sounds like a complicated meal, and you can't be bothered to show her the courtesy of eating it with her and showing some appreciation? \nI doubt she'll bother again.", "YTA she was doing something nice for everyone. That meal sounded delicious. There was zero excuse for you to be rude.", "However you normally do meals is fine.  Your sister said she wanted to make dinner for everyone, she did and you can't even be bothered to get the family together in a show of appreciation?\n\nSoft YTA", "I have to vote YTA because y\u2019all just seem plain mean and lack empathy. \n\nI can understand that your system works well for you. Personally I\u2019d hate it if that were my family, but everyone is different. You\u2019re correct that she can\u2019t dictate to you what happens in your home. If she wanted a family sit down she should have communicated it before. I do think you could have approached the situation a little more nicely. It\u2019s also odd to me that something so simple would set you and your husband off this much.\n\nI just feel bad for your sister. She went to a lot of work to put the meal together. What was her life like before she moved in with you guys? Were sit down dinners normal for her? I\u2019d bet she may just be missing that from her life being in a new environment.", "Keep in mind that it is, as you said, your home and not hers. Living somewhere that is not your home is not always easy and doesn't feel \"home\". She wanted to say thanks by having a sit-down dinner with all of you. You could've had dinner with her if that doesn't work for the kids but just shutting her down is an ass-move. YTA.", "YTA, but thank you for posting this. I never knew how much i valued my family dinners every night growing up until i read this.", "YTA. This bummed me out for some reason.", "Yeah, YTA. Cooking is often a way to show affection and appreciation. You shot her down.", "YTA.  She made a nice dinner for everyone with a plan to enjoy it together but your whole family (including you) is so entitled that it just had to be your way.  She wasn't insisting on it every night, just when she took the time to prepare something special.", "YTA. Would it have killed you to tell the kids \u201chey, your aunt is preparing a nice dinner and we are all going to sit down for dinner together\u201d? The bedroom thing is gross and basically setting them up for weird table manners as adults. Stop this now before they end up being the rude person at their company functions, business dinners, dinners with significant others\u2019 families, etc.", "YTA\n\nYou said you have family dinners. This could have been one of those. Instead you are unnecessarily trying to dominate your sister (who's half your age btw) who only wants to have a nice family dinner.", "YTA - You say you\u2019ve had family dinnners before, so then what was the big deal about eating together for a meal your sister put thought and effort into?", "YTA. Sitting together and having a meal when someone goes to the effort of cooking for everyone is just basic manners. I'm sure you're used to your family dynamic (or complete and utter lack thereof) but having a meal together is important to some people. \n\nShe wasn't asking for much and not asking for everyone to change how mealtimes work. It seems everyone was home and she just wanted to share a meal, talk, and be part of a  family for a meal.\n\nBut god forbid you give an inch as doing that would mean that your failing to spend quality family time is highlighted and you want to keep the dysfunctional status quo.", "YTA.\n\nAlso, regular family dinners are associated with lower rates of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, eating disorders, tobacco use, and early teenage pregnancy, and higher rates of resilience and higher self esteem.", "YTA big time. Elina put time and effort into making a lovely dinner and setting the table, and instead of showing some gratitude and teaching your children manners, you two insulted her and made it all about you. It would have been little to no effort to sit at the table and show some appreciation. \n>\nI don\u2019t care what you say or think, but your current setup of everyone eating in their room is not working. This is not healthy.", "YTA. This is not her dictating anything, she just cooked a whole feast and wanted to have a nice dinner together, which you yourself said you sometimes do have. You were being rude and ungrateful. I feel bad for your sister.", "YTA. Common courtesy, like sense, is increasingly becoming scarcer and scarcer. The polite thing to do would be to just sit the fuck down and eat, and say thank you for the meal. \n\nIt's not as if she was saying \"lets all have a sit down dinner together\" and then force you to cook and set the table and clean. All the hard work was done already.\n\nThe only thing you had to do was be present and sit the fuck down. Refusing to do so is incredibly rude. \nIf your kids didn't want to, then let them be assholes and make that decision, don't decide for them.", ">The way dinner usually works in my household is I dish up the food, then my kids take it to their rooms to eat.

Or is it just laziness because setting the table for 4 people is such a huge chore? This is so extremely weird. Meal times, specially diner, is the one time where the whole family gets together to talk about their day or just share things. You guys sound like a bunch of unrelated roommates.\n\nYour 13 year old was in fact capable of waiting a few minutes until she ate, what are you even teaching your children?", "When someone goes through the effort of making a three course meal it\u2019s implied that there\u2019s a certain formality to it and that it\u2019s to be enjoyed together. \n\nIf you can\u2019t stomach waiting just a few minutes, turn down her offer and order a tv-dinner you can just scarf down instead.

You have no idea what is going on with your kids or husband lives because you are all living separate lives all under one roof.    Your sister made dinner and wanted to sit down as a family and you wanted nothing to do with it.  I understand everyone does their own thing but really", "YTA- major YTA. Do you just not want to spend time with your family? Your sister made a gorgeous sounding meal that must have taken ages to prepare and you start throwing your weight around acting as though having to actually sit at a table is an insult. Then you act all snooty about it and get your husband involved. You are going to raise little brats with very unhealthy habits if this continues. It\u2019s not like she demanded you sit there every night for hours. It was one meal, one time. Also it doesn\u2019t take that long to set a table. How lazy are you?", "YTA for not showing appreciation for your sister\u2019s gesture of thanks to your family and also because you don\u2019t have sit down meals with your kids. Family meal time is an easy way to have family time and your family sounds like they could use more together time and less grabbing food and going back to the solitude of their room.", "Wow, way to crush her attempt to have a nice family dinner party. She was trying to do something specific that would feel different and special and you shit all over that. YTA.", "YTA. What did I just read? You couldn't just eat at the table that night instead of letting your kids eat in their rooms? Dinner was nearly done, but you had to serve your 16 year old that second? You are teaching your kids horrible manners by showing a lack of respect towards the cook, who went out of her way to make a nice meal for you. Did your kids even thank her?\n\nETA: I saw your responses. Judgment is the same. You could have found a way to convey that you loved the meal, would like to do it again, and that certain days of the week would work best for you because if it's known in advance, you can plan for it and ensure there are no conflicts.", "OP This could have been a really nice family dinner where everyone got to reconnect and unwind and you just stomped your foot and selfishly demanded things your way.\n\nGood luck having someone wanting to make you a three course dinner again.\n\nYTA", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like she was trying to dictate anything. She did something incredibly nice for your family. And instead of appreciating this kindness, you and your husband act like major AHs to her. Would it have killed you to sit together and an enjoy a meal as a family for one night? My feelings would be hurt, too. Guess your sister just found out the hard way what kind of people she is staying with.", "YTA and that\u2019s not even addressing the poor behaviors you\u2019re teaching your children. She cooked a lovely dinner and wanted to invite everyone to sit together and enjoy it, you couldn\u2019t respect her work and teach your children to respect people as well? \n\nBut also back to eating in your rooms.

This is not okay. Ew.", "And here  is the perfect example of why people have a hard time socially  interacting. Eating separately? Kid can't  wait a few more minutes  for food?  Wow sister wanted the family  to really appreciate what  sounded  like a great meal. YtA", "YTA. There are proven benefits of having scheduled family dinners. When I go to the trouble of making a decent meal you will sure as hell sit your arse down and eat it like a respectful human. I don't care of you're six or sixty. You sit at that table, show some basic good manners, act social, enjoy the food and then when everyone is done you can go your separate ways and be anti social. \n\nAs a side not, children don't suddenly drop dead when they have to wait for five minutes for a table to be set. It teaches them patience and is a sign of good manners. What you are doing is setting them up as a massive issue for other people in the future.\n\nRemember that little line about having to parent your romantic partner? One day you're going to have another person vehemently despise you for the bad manners you have instilled in your children.", "YTA. Your whole interpretation of your little sisters actions seem very negative when it just sounds like she wanted to enjoy a meal she worked hard on with the whole family. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, and while I find the whole \u201ceat alone in your room\u201d thing very weird, if that\u2019s what you guys normally do, then fine - but she cooked a nice meal and just wanted to enjoy it with her family and there was actually nothing negative or forceful behind her actions. \n\nThe fact that OP turned her nice actions into a \u201cshe\u2019s trying to dictate how my family lives\u201d type of thing is just so weird.", "YTA\n\nShe made dinner and wanted to share it with you all. She wasn't changing the rules of the house or anything. She made the dinner and wanted to eat it together.", "Info: do your kids manage Christmas or Thanksgiving without throwing a fit when meals aren't ready when they're hungry? Do they know how to eat in a group of people? Why is there no eating routine in your house? Sitting together and chatting about the day? \nFor me it sounds like your sister is sitting alone at the table on every single evening eating her meal all alone while you all take a plate and run away to eat alone in your own rooms. \nYTA", "YTA. She wasn't undermining your authority nor criticizing your family habits. She was trying to gift a positive experience of gratitude.\n\nShe spent a lot of time to prepare a meal (do you have any idea how much effort go into making dumplings?) to enjoy together. The respectful thing to do is to enjoy that meal as it is presented. It is also within social norms to express gratitude. A minor change of habits like that should be taken without complaints. Because don't forget, she has done things your way for the last few months. She's only asking for an hour or so.\n\nYou basically taught your children it's OK to get angry at someone who spend time and energy into a thoughtful gift, because she asks you to change your habits for an hour or so. Not a good lesson in the long run. That was insanely disrespectful of you.", "YTA.  Elina did a fabulously kind thing in an attempt to show appreciation and to enjoy time with her family!  And you shat all over it.  Your excuses about how your family doesn't do it that way, everyone prefers to eat in solitude are bullshit.  Far be it from your kid sister to want a shared dinner that cultivates a warm, caring family.

Once you are on your death bed, will you be glad you told your sister off, or will you wish you had more time with your family, the people you claim to love?  \nYou have zero sense of priorities.  Why do you need so much control here?  Why can't you tell 13 year old it will be done in 5 minutes, just be patient?  You can, you've just given up.  \nFix it.  Make a big dinner with cake yourself, and tell everyone in advance we are eating it together.  Then, stand up in the middle of it, and apologize to your sister for disrespecting her.

In that way you teach your kids how to act when they screw up, and maybe you get your sister back.  \nYTAYTAYTA.  \nP.S. Your kids can set and clear the table.

She likely wanted to spend time with everybody. Because that\u2019s what eating a meal at a table is about. It\u2019s an opportunity to spend some time with people and bond. It\u2019s obviously your choice to live how you want, and you clearly prioritize solo pursuits over bonding with your children and building what are pretty normal social habits. But the way you acted here was so weird and wildly immature.

Eating separately like that most days of the week is odd, but again, your home, but letting them choose to eat alone in a room when a family member did something nice and wants to spend time together is a horrible example.

I also get your sister spent time preparing a meal and wanted to have the family share it together, again a totally cool thing to do, but knowing how you all eat daily she should of stated before the meal was made it would be a sit down meal to avoid any of this nonsense.\n\nYou could of just ate at the table, it wouldn't have killed your 13 year old to wait a little bit to eat nor would it have killed you to just be a tad bit flexible for someone who put in so much effort into dinner and just wanted to sit and eat with the family.", "I say NAH. \n\nIt was nice of her to cook and bake, and that she wanted to sit together as a family. No doubt. It's sweet. But, you guys also have a routine and there's nothing wrong with that. You told her   \nthat multiple times, nicely. As did your husband. It's not like you were mean or anything. If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.   \n\n\nHowever, she DID go through the trouble of cooking and baking. Would it have been so bad for the 13 yo to wait a couple/few more minutes, and indulge her the once? For everyone to sit together as a family, like your sister wanted? I don't think she's trying to \"dictate\" how you do things. That would probably require multiple efforts on her part, I feel like. But just wanting the meal she cooked to be a table family meal seems like a harmless request. So, just some things to maybe consider...", "YTA", "YTA and really rigid", "NAH.  She did a nice thing and wanted to do family dinner. However, she should have cleared it with you in advance.  I don\u2019t think it would have hurt you to sit down with her one time though. Everyone needs to communicate clearly.", "YTA. She cooked the dinner and wanted everyone to eat together, you had a problem with that? then tell her NICELY. \n\n>she doesn't have to dictate what we do on my home\n\ntrue but since she cooked the food, you could've listened to what she had to say before going \"my house my rule\" on her.", "YTA Jesus Christ she made y\u2019all a nice dinner. The least you could do is sit the fuck down and eat it with her. Dinner doesn\u2019t have to go the same way every night. She cooked. She wanted a family dinner. You SAID you have family dinners. So you essentially told her \u201cyou don\u2019t matter even if you\u2019re doing something nice\u201d.", "NAH I get her point as she also had a lot of work with it and felt it underappreciated with the normal eating,you have this practice in the house and she needs to accept that maybe you were a little to rough on her,but in the end she needs to accept how your family handles dinner as guest", "I just can't with this one.\n\nYTA", "YTA gently. It would have allowed you to express your appreciation of a lovely meal. Maybe she should have given you time to get used to the idea.", "ESH because what should have been a minor detail became the hill you\u2019d both die on.", "NAH. You are used to your ways and that's okay if it works for your family. But your sister probably wanted to show that she is thankful and expected more of a family dinner with everyone together. I can imagine her disappointment when she cooked what seemed like elaborate dinner and nobody wants to eat with her. She may have wanted to see if you all liked it. Communication was missing here. And it would not have hurt you to eat with her. Even if a kid is hungry, at that age they can wait a little longer and have a nice family dinner. But again, your ways, and if it works, it's fine. Just talk with each other about such things, so nobody is irritated or disappointed.", "NAH.\n\nSounds like Elina was very well-intentioned and was hoping to do something nice for everyone. She should have discussed first to see if that's something you were all willing to do. That doesn't make her an asshole.\n\nYou were blind-sided by this and it's fair that you wanted to follow the usual routine.\n\nI'd suggest you do talk to her about maybe setting up a specific time to do a family dinner once things settle down, it would probably be a very nice evening.", "NTA. I cant believe at the y t a responses. She clearly knows how dinner is run in YOUR house hold. If she expected something else, she should have made this clear. If she came to you the day before and said she wanted to prepare a nice meal, and everyone eat it together, that would be completely different. But to impose her own wishes on your whole family at dinner time isn't the way to do it.", "NTA/NAH. It\u2019s not like she discussed wanting to eat together previously. If she\u2019d given everyone a heads-up it would\u2019ve been different. Despite putting in effort, she should\u2019ve taken the no as an answer. She should\u2019ve communicated what she wanted. She\u2019s obviously been there long enough to see how you guys do things.\n\nOur household is very similar to yours and even when we do make something special for dinner, it\u2019s often difficult to get everyone together, due to clashes in schedules. And some people just don\u2019t eat at the same time or want to eat together. My grandparents eat at 5, while we prefer eating later. If someone wants to eat together they\u2019ll let everyone know and we\u2019ll try to accommodate them, but it\u2019s unreasonable to expect everyone to change their schedule and routine without a heads up.", "NTA-we also were a very busy family with different schedules, activities, and dinner times, especially on weeknights. Most families do not understand this because most families have little to do in the evenings. The comments suggesting you were rude are actually assuming that the members of your family were free to drop everything that was going on and change their schedules to appreciate Elina\u2019s cooking, while I think this was more of a misunderstanding. Elina expected one thing; you expected another, and no one spoke about it. Frankly, since Elina was proposing changing the routine, the responsibility was on her to make sure your family understood the expectations ahead of time.\n\nJust give Elina space and she will get over it. Thank her for making dinner, and tell her that next time, if you two can plan the date ahead of time, the family can definitely sit together to eat a meal. Treat it as if you were going out for dinner, and make sure your family members all know what time dinner will be on that day so they can plan in advance.\n\nEdited to add: Elina\u2019s not an AH either. No one is. This is just a matter of improving communication.", " NTA. She knows how your family does things so if she wanted a sit down dinner she should have asked before she decided to cook.", "NTA. Your sister was trying to do something nice but it isn't nice being forced to do something your really don't want to do.\n\nIf you let her have her way it most likely have been disruptive to the rest of the family at point in the day when most people crave their routine. Especially when you're at those ages. When I was 13 I ate separately form my family because I just wanted some damn peace and quiet in a family of 6.\n\nYour sister needs to learn to respect boundaries and to the commenters saying you're ungrateful should ask your sister how much money she would've spent renting a room somewhere else.\n\nI would've said N A H, but she didn't want to listen to either you and your husband when you updated her on how you guys do dinner. The pushiness and sulking makes her the AH.", "NTA because it\u2019s your house and your family. You have every right to do dinner the way you want, regardless of what others think.", "NTA. \n\nElina took it upon herself to make dinner, knowing what the dynamic is. \n\nIf she wanted to change the routine she should have put it forth on a calendar and made everyone aware. \n\nIt isn\u2019t for her to tell you how to run your household.", "ESH. Question - when you were younger is that how y\u2019all were raised? To just grab food and go your own ways? I can understand that logic with 8 kids, but you only have 2. It wouldn\u2019t kill you to all sit down together and appreciate a home cooked meal that someone took the time to make you. Yeah, it takes away personal time, but you have your whole lives to be alone by yourself. Have you considered your sister is maybe feeling lonely out there and just wanted to bond with your family for a second? \n\nMaybe schedule a sit down dinner that you and your sister make together for the family, it really won\u2019t kill you to eat together as a family.", "NTA. But neither is your sister. Your house your rules, but also you need to understand her perspective as well.", "YTA, but your younger sister should have gotten your agreement beforehand.  You don't change a families routine without notice.\n\nA little flexibility and go with the flow would have been a nice gesture.", "NTA. If you do dinner a certain way every time, then she should of told you in advance.

But you're definitely an AH about it.  You're the eldest of 8 and she's the youngest.  She is most recently alone. Now she's back with a bigger family and probably a bit lonely.  She wanted some family time and put a lot of effort into it.  You could have considered it a special occasion like a holiday and have made effort to enjoy it with her how she wanted.  She's clearly sad living there and not being involved in anyone's lives. \n\nShe is not an AH but it does suck that she kept ignoring what you were saying while you both tried to explain what you wanted to happen.  \n\nDo you like your convenience to watch TV, scroll your phone, etc more than you care about your sister or enjoy the company of your own family for one meal?  What do you do for holidays or special events?  Do you never go out to eat?  The lack of any amount of flexibility here is really what confuses me.", "NAH. I think your sister was trying to do something nice, and for the whole family to share the experience. I think you felt judged for the dining habits your family has formed.

Me and my husband have 2 kids (16 and 13). Elina's staying with us for 4 months because she started at a new college, and she needs some time to sort out housing. She's been here for a couple of weeks so far, last night she made dinner for everyone (she said she wanted to).\n\nThe way dinner usually works in my household is I dish up the food, then my kids take it to their rooms to eat. We obviously have family dinner too, but this is just more convenient for all of us as we don't have to spend time setting the table every day, and we can eat at different times if needed (also by different times I don't mean someone eats at 7 pm and someone eats at 3 am, just a small gap).\n\nI know this isn't for everyone and that's okay, but this is what works for our family. Elina knows this.\n\nSo last night she made fried dumplings, orange chicken, fried rice and chocolate cake for dessert. I went into the kitchen to thank her and saw her setting the table. I told Elina she doesn't need to do that and we'll take food from the pot.\n\nMy 13 yo started saying she was hungry so I went to get food since everything was done, but Elina stopped me and said to wait a few minutes and we'll eat together. Again I told her that's not how it really works here, one of my kids is hungry now, but my 16 yo usually eats a bit later.\n\nElina then said she was going to serve the dumplings first, then chicken and rice and cake after. I repeated to her, again, we can get the main food at once, cake later and if anyone wants seconds we'll come and get it, it's fine, no need to set the table.\n\nShe looked upset and said she wants to have a 'nice dinner together' and 'involve the kids'. I had enough at this point so I told her I know my kids and family, she doesn't have to dictate what we do on my home. My husband saw what was going on and told Elina thanks, but we know how to serve ourselves.\n\nElina eventually understood but she was acting sulky, and giving me the cold shoulder this morning.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I would say YATA but it seems to be a problem that's easy to try and fix.\n\nI think that you should've recognized as the more mature one that she probably put a lot of effort into making that whole full course dinner for you and your family. She must have spent a lot of time and probably wanted to see how you guys enjoyed it while having a nice conversation, she is probably a bit home sick and feeling alone.\n\nOf course, I think she should have told everyone she wanted to make a big dinner and wanted everyone to come. But I don't see why that night couldn't have been an exception to the usual family habits. She is now in a way part of the family and it will take more time to adjust to things like that, but I think trying to stop that effort that she made to connect won't help towards the goal of happy coliving.\n\nMaybe next time you can encourage her to select a date for a nice lunch if is more convinient for you guys and ask her to have some nice apeticers for the people that get hungry first. Or maybe cook and eat dinner together, so that you can share a moment of connection in the kitchen after this disagreement.", "I can\u2019t imagine cooking a 3 course meal for my family then having to eat alone at the table or alone in my room because they\u2019re all so ungrateful and rude that they couldn\u2019t sit at the table with me for one freaking meal. YTA", "YTA\n\nYour sister was trying to show her appreciation but it flew over your head OP. Couldn't you bend the rules just for ONE night?

You couldn\u2019t put aside what you usually do for ONE NIGHT to enjoy a 3 course meal made for you as a GIFT OF APPRECIATION?", "Yrs on more ways then one.\nYour parenting is teaching your kid to be lazy as their mom is.\nLet them set the table of it's too much work for you.\nYour sister wanted something nice and you dismissed her like she nothing.\nYou should live what she did.", "YTA.  She made a three course meal for your family as a thank you and wanted to sit and enjoy it as a family meal.  Instead of having your family come and sit together (as you say you do sometimes) you insisted she let your kids come take this meal she had put effort into and eat it alone in their rooms.  That\u2019s extremely rude and a horrible lesson to teach your children.", "You sister put time, effort and money into treating your family with a nice dinner. Even if we put aside your family\u2019s eating habits, why couldn\u2019t it be this night the night of a family dinner? Because you wanted to prove a point, it\u2019s your home and your rules!? \n\nThat was a really poor way to handle the situation and also extremely rude. Would she made some frozen pizza, I would be more understanding sticking to your rules. But she made a 3 course meal for you and your family! Way to show her that you appreciate her efforts\u2026\n\nYTA", "YTA, this was a special dinner and meant to be eaten in courses.

The 13 year old is not gonna starve.", "Can your kids cook? Do you teach them? Or they will have to learn alone. Like eating. Does your family even spend time together?

If you say that sometimes you eat together as a family, why can\u2019t this time be one of those situations? She made an entire dinner and dessert for you and your kids.

For her?", "YTA I mean I think just some better communication would\u2019ve fixed the issue. When she offered to cook dinner did she say then, she wanted to have a sit down family dinner? Either way it should\u2019ve been made clear by you what the expectation for her,  and the family would be regarding the dinner.  I think you acted unfairly towards her, I don\u2019t think she was dictating your family around but instead had a idea of this nice family meal saying thank you for having her and bonding with household a little more.", "YTA This was just flat out rude. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t trying to make a statement about your house rules and it\u2019s weird that you immediately got defensive after she did something nice. Regardless of your day to day routine, you could have invited the kids and husband to eat at the table. The 13 year old was hungry. If the 16 year old refused, I understand not making a big deal about it, but you throwing a tantrum over sitting at the table is more than a little immature. The snide comments that you \u201cknow how to serve yourselves\u201d is just being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole.", "YTA.  I hope you enjoyed the meal cause I doubt she will ever cook for you again.\n\nBy allowing your family to take each and every meal alone in their room, you are also encouraging anti social behavior.  Studies show that sit down meal time has a very positive influence on kids.", "YTA, like gossssggh just look in the ffkng mirror please.", "NTA.  Your house, your rules.  Just because your sister made some food, doesn't mean she controls how dinner takes place in your house.", "ESH the sister was trying to do something nice for the family as a whole.  But it sounds to me like she didn\u2019t properly communicate what she wanted to do and just expected everyone to break routine when she was done.  I\u2019m sure if she had communicated that she wanted to make a sit down family meal for everyone to gather around they could have worked that out on a day that works for everyone.  I have two kids that aren\u2019t even that old yet but they have various activities throughout the week, and even though we eat together at the same time everyday, sometimes that\u2019s very early in the evening and that wouldn\u2019t work for everyone in every situation.", "NTA - it's the hot take but always been my opinion that people who do nice things just to attach strings to it are the asshole every time. She had no reason to expect this to go well and maybe could have told you that plan straight up before ever making the dinner. They let themselves down", "YTA\n\nShe made dinner for you guys, probably in part because she wanted to have dinner *with* you guys.\n\nYou haven't mentioned her being upset about how you guys have dinner before, so she's okay with it. Just not this time because *she made dinner* and she was excited to share what she made and serve it like a restaurant.\n\nYeah, maybe she should have told you her expectations ahead of time. But it's not unreasonable for her to expect that you guys would sit down with her and enjoy a family meal.\n\nYou need to apologize to her.", "YTA - as someone who grew up in a household like yours, taking the food somewhere else and ignoring the rest of the family, it sucks when you get older. But mainly YTA because she cooked something for the family and wanted (for once) to sit down and enjoy the evening with everyone. Instead you threw a fit. Be a parent and tell your older kid to come down and eat and tell your little kid to be nice and sit down. Your sister was literally setting up the table (herself) it would had been 5 more mins maybe until you got to eat.", "Of course YTA, your sister was doing something super nice and it was an opportunity for your family to bond.

Elina has been raised better than you, strangely enough.\n\nI used to cook dinner for my family every day, but then as the kids grew older, one person was late, had a class, one had already eaten something else, etc, and in the end, I would never know how many of them would show up. I couldn't clean the kitchen after dinner, because everybody could show up at any time, and sometimes leave a mess, sometimes after I went to bed. Sometimes I had lots of leftovers, sometimes none. One day, dinner was ready, and NOBODY was home. That's the day I stopped cooking dinner, and told them they could all eat at school, at work, whatever. \n\nOne of the pay-offs of cooking dinner is watching people enjoy your food.", "What a ridiculous thing for you to get mad at.  YTA", "YTA. She cooked a meal and was trying to have a family night with people she loves. You shit all over it. I WISH my sister lived close enough so we could share a meal. YTA.", "YTA your sister made a great meal and wanted to sit down with all of you.  The fact that you refused is really weird and controlling", "YTA.  Agree with others that your sister cannot expect family routines to be altered to suit her, but she had been very thoughtful and kind, went to a lot of trouble and she was asking only for a meal together on one occasion.  That was too much for the rest of you.  Her kindness will be wasted while she stays with you.  She should move on.  And you can continue spending more time typing to reddit than setting the table.", "YTA try something new sometimes...it may surprise you", "YTA, seriously how rude.", ">We obviously have family dinner too,\n\nThen do that.

Make a plate and sit down, ffs.", "YTA, i'd be more grateful if someone made me a full meal. it's a one time thing and you shut her down.", "YTA for sure. You and your family could learn some manners and appreciate properly someone cooking such a meal for you and wanting to spend some quality time with you.", "NAH. Your sister wanted a family dinner. I completely get it, but that should have been communicated prior so everyone knew instead of her saying something last minute. You're not wrong for doing things how you normally do without any prior knowledge either. I'd have a talk with her and just say you don't have an issue eating together, you'd just like more of a heads up next time.", "YTA, you sister made a huge meal and wanted to spend time with all of you and you were just an ass about it.

When someone does something nice for you, you could at least pretend to appreciate it.", "You are a literal idiot.

My family was this family most nights. Our schedules were always busy and all over the place so we only sat down to eat together at a table a couple of times a week. I don\u2019t like seeing the judgements against the way your family does this because it assumes people don\u2019t talk or know what is going on in the kids lives. We just didn\u2019t eat together because someone was always cooling down from sports practice or working on something for school. \n\nYour sister wanted to do something nice, which is awesome, but she knows how your family defaults for dinner and should have taken extra steps to let everyone know she was preparing a sit down dinner. \n\nI\u2019m guessing that there is a disconnect between your family and your sister in other regards as well.", "YTA it was on a off, she did something nice and you were obnoxious. Would you all die if you had just as a one off sat down and eaten a nice and different meal. She wanted to thank you. She wasnt changing house rules.", "Aww. OP- she was trying to do something nice for you, and you crushed her. She even asked you the best day to do it. Even if you didn\u2019t understand what she meant in that moment, it should\u2019ve been made clear to you when she was setting the table. You could\u2019ve politely rallied the husband and kids to show her you appreciated her efforts. Instead, you stomped all over it, and her. Light YTA, because I totally understand teenagers and family dynamics (our family often eats at varying times as well), but we still do family dinners as often as possible. You could\u2019ve taken this moment to enjoy a sit down family dinner made by your sister. She was a sweetheart to do that, and you ruined it based on \u201cbut that\u2019s not how we do it\u201d. Apologize for misunderstanding and see if she wants to make a weekly family meal on a day that works for you all to sit down at the table.", "Wow YTA. Would have killed you to have a family meal this occasional time? Plus your husband saying we know how to serve ourselves. Someone was trying to do something nice and this is how you treat them. I don\u2019t think your sister will repeat that mistake of making you a meal. I also suspect she will be leaving soon, even if it is less than ideal for her to live in.", "YTA. She asked you about it and you told her the day. I mean if I cooked for everyone like that I would be really hurt if they didn\u2019t come to the table and eat like that. And I\u2019m not talking about if someone is not home, but eating together. And it sounds like she asked and you told her a time.", "YTA. You are rude, entitled and inconsiderate.

Your family dynamic also sounds really unhealthy.", "YTA \n\nSure that\u2019s how it works on a regular night. \n\nThat meal isn\u2019t a basic Tuesday dinner.

We were a busy family too but make a point to have meals together when we can. I think that has contributed to us being close. Many meals are quick BTW and not overly involved.
