There's a good chance that both of your bio parents are lying without even realizing it.\n\nAnyway, do NOT reject the parents who raised you in favor of a man who MIGHT have raised you.

There is a reason why your mom did what she did and you deserve to hear her side. It sounds like she gave you the sad info and it\u2019s not pretty. This situation is a huge shock so take some time to really digest it. I don\u2019t think having you bio dad walk you down the aisle is appropriate. For bad or worse, he wasn\u2019t your dad.

You\u2019d rather support a man who ABUSED his wife for cheating on him (or so he says). Your mother did you a favour by getting out of there. The person who abuses one can abuse others as well, she probably saved your lives by leaving him. This is how you treat her now? You and your brother should be ashamed of yourselves. Nothing, I repeat, nothing justifies abuse. He literally beat her up and you don\u2019t find it wrong? Yes your mother made a mistake, she was unfaithful, but does that make it okay for your \u201cdad\u2019 to abuse her? He could\u2019ve killed her.

I can't BELIEVE that you are on here defending the man that beat his wife! You can be mad at your mom for lying to you, but you shouldn't be defending him for beating his wife. The one reason anyone should lay a  finger on another person is in self defense or defending another person. Cheating is not an excuse for being a wife beater.

Unfortunately for your mum, you guys have been building a relationship and that means you want him there.

I wish you luck.", "NTA. There is so much trauma here and it sounds like everyone in this situation could benefit from some therapy to work through it.

They both did horrible things to each other. The difference is that your MOM continued to do horrible things to YOU. She lied about your parentage and tried to pass off her lover as your father. She kept your real father from knowing he had a child, and she totally deprived YOU of knowing your REAL father throughout your childhood. These are things that CANNOT be undone - through her lies and omissions, she has ALTERED the course of your life! And yet she STILL takes NO OWNERSHIP of how she has VIOLATED you??!!  On top of that she is making demands and punishing you and your brother about all of this?! Unforgivable. Time to wake up and realize that she is still putting HERSELF first. You should walk down the aisle with whomever you want, it's your wedding - not anyone else's.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your wedding and (apparently) your bio dad's money.

They don\u2019t start beating you right at the start. They start telling you how you\u2019re so lucky they love you, how they\u2019re the only one who does. They manipulate and isolate you. Then they start doing reckless things and blaming you for it. They work on making you think that this is normal and you deserve it. My high school boyfriend would drive recklessly while yelling at me and saying he would crash the car until I was begging him to slow down and taking responsibility for whatever fight we had. And I thought it was normal. They make it so normal that by the time they start hitting the things around you, you don\u2019t even see the danger. You\u2019re just glad they didn\u2019t hit you. They then slowly escalate to physical abuse. All while blaming you and saying they couldn\u2019t help it because of whatever you did. And that\u2019s not even the other psychological torture. The constant \u201cyou\u2019re cheating\u201d and having to prove that you aren\u2019t. In my opinion OPs mom probably just got so tired of it that she knew it didn\u2019t matter if she actually cheated or not, she was going to get accused and beaten for it anyways. OP lacks empathy and critical thought. The chances of a woman being murdered raise SIGNIFICANTLY when they decide to leave. Of course OPs mom didn\u2019t just leave before cheating. She was up against a man who had money and power and was hitting her. Finding someone who loved her and wanted her to be happy was probably something she didn\u2019t think she could trust. Because I can promise you he told her no one would love her. I\u2019m willing to bet finding out she was pregnant was her last straw. The fear for her children and having a safety net opened the door for her to leave. When I broke up with my high school boyfriend he spent months showing up places he knew I would be and sending letters to my house. He was stalking me all while telling everyone else that I\u2019m just an abuser and he has no idea why I think he\u2019s still obsessed with me. I was afraid of him until the day he died. I can\u2019t imagine being OPs mother who fought so hard to be able to leave and protect her family, just to have her own children tell her she deserved it because he threw some cash at them. OP and her brother have no idea that their dad is using them to further abuse their mother. I promise you he takes great satisfaction in knowing that they\u2019re choosing him over her. \n\nAlso, OP if you read this, look up the abuse cycle. There\u2019s a honeymoon period where abusers are incredibly charming and give a lot of gifts. You have no idea what he is still capable of. Your mother tried to shield and protect you from it. To let you think you were the children of from what appears to be a great guy, instead of a man how I can promise you would never have stopped hitting her. That\u2019s a heavy burden to carry as a child. The knowledge that one of your parents hurts people. She was trying to carry that for you. Also your brother getting kicked out sounds like he said something along the lines of your attitude- she deserved it.

I hope she kicks your ass to the curb. \n\nYou obviously approve of domestic violence and don't see anything wrong with it.\n\nSHE DID SOMETHING VERY BAD? SO SHE DESERVED TO GET THE SHIT BEAT OUT OF HER? GFY", "No, HE did something very bad. She was trying to protect herself and you. YTA", "So you are okay with your mom getting beat up and abused because it\u2019s your \u2728daddy\u2728?", "\u201cI can excuse domestic abuse, but I draw the line at lying\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can forgive domestic abuse?\u201d", "And he physically beat your mother. Isn\u2019t that bad? Is it normal for you? Would you hit your partner in a rage? Say your fianc\u00e9 burns your coffee, is that worth a slap? How does it work in your mind?", "You will never know him if you only want to believe the good things about him. Do you honest believe if someone is an abuser that they just stop being a bad person because their victim got away? I get it. You act just like my half-sisters. They would ignore and forgive anything my father did because they were raised away from him. They just SO BADLY wanted to be loved by him that they overlooked his abuse. The people that were around him all the time, like me, ran as soon as they could because we actually believed the truth of him.\n\nHe would have used you as a pawn against your mother or started beating you too if you'd grown up with him. He's using you now to exact vengeance on your Mom for leaving. If he makes you feel like she deserved the abuse then he wins. And if you believe him then you're even worse.", "Get it through your thick ass skull that your mother prevented you from growing up in an ABUSIVE household. Your father knows what he did was wrong and he KNOWS he is manipulating you. Don\u2019t fall for it. Why would you want to be with someone who abused you\u2019re mother? You\u2019re sick and I hope your fianc\u00e9 re-evaluates who he is marrying.", "Oh please it\u2019s the money and lifestyle you crave you convinced yourself otherwise", "yeah OP cant become a good person its clear from the comments.", "I see OP has provided more context in the comments. Obviously abuse is a different scenario. I refer back to my first statement- OP needs therapy.", "Was this in a comment?", "Yeah, OP provided a lot more detail in the comments since I posted this morning.", "Nope. See, I\u2019m not going to go go digging through dozens of other comments and other posts like some kind of creepy stalker. The way this works is the person posts a narrative and we give an answer. But if what you say is true, that he did beat her then my answer would still be that the Mom sucks, but that the Dad sucks too. Still not going to fault OP for having shitty parents.", "Sorry sorry you\u2019re right women can\u2019t be abusive. I am sure her kids would agree\u2026oh wait.", "Yep. He\u2019s already bought OP and OP isn\u2019t willing to let that gravy train pass by", "Because he has money and she wants that. Just a guess", "In the post \n\n>I told her she was the cheater and it was her fault I never knew him anyway.", "Unless they're twins, how does that work?", "He didn't know he had kids at all.", "Hahaha. Decades ago that wasn't true.", "Mom also claims son is an abuser for supporting OP for having a relationship with their bio-dad.\n\nClearly Mom is an unreliable narrator", "There\u2019s no excuse for abuse ever. It\u2019s not biased prejudgement. The men are literally here defending abuse because it wasn\u2019t \u201cabusive enough\u201d.", "Or through money tinted glasses", "I don\u2019t think abuse needs to be scored but I don\u2019t disagree with you. I just think they\u2019re both objectively shitty people so my vote is ESH.", "She\u2019s only 21 so with a little delayed emotional development it\u2019s not surprising she\u2019s still thinking like a child. Her brain literally hasn\u2019t finished developing. Definitely isn\u2019t emotionally mature enough to be getting married.", "Depends on how much money he gives her to let it go.", "21", "Alright join downvote hell with OP. Her father abused her mother, admitted to it, but he\u2019s sorry. That makes everything okay then? Nah you\u2019re just as sick as OP for thinking that.", "I hate to make assumptions about people I\u2019ve never met, but OP definitely gives off that vibe\u2026 \ud83d\ude2c", "She left after she said that. She doesn\u2019t mention how the mom responded to that. In any event it\u2019s doubtful the abuse was due to cheating. More like vice versa.", "Per the edit they are twins yes", "Yeah probably so. Though he didn't try anyway sooooooo.....", "Older than I thought, but still very young. I think you need to realize that your image of your father and who he actually is are two different things. You\u2019re likely so enamored with this idea of a wealthy father that you\u2019ve made up in your head that you fail to realize it\u2019s just a fantasy. \n\nComing from someone who BEGGED her mother to leave her abusive father- she saved you. And you\u2019re blaming her for doing the RIGHT THING. Because you feel like something was stolen from you. This is childlike thinking and you NEED to grow up.\n\nSay you\u2019re pregnant and your husband gets mad one day because you were out with a guy friend and didn\u2019t answer your phone. His behavior toward you changed and he becomes paranoid, constantly accusing you of doing bad things. Eventually, he starts putting his hands on you. You have to make the decision- do you leave for your sake and the sake of the child? You can\u2019t promise he won\u2019t hurt your child and you don\u2019t want them growing up in a violent household. When he finally locks you in a room and doesn\u2019t let you out- you decide you want better for your kid and flee in the night.\n\nI was the child of an abuser. I was asking my mom to leave from the time I was very small. You have no idea the hell you escaped. You\u2019re lucky.", "How old is your brother?", "Always nice to fight against the machine. Have a great day.", "> Though he didn't try anyway sooooooo.....\n\nDidn't try to get custody of the children that he didn't know he had? Yea imagine that...", "If he didn't know they existed, he couldn't fight for them. I'm skeptical about that being true, but it could be."]}
