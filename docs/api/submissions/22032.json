This situation is a huge shock so take some time to really digest it. I don\u2019t think having you bio dad walk you down the aisle is appropriate. For bad or worse, he wasn\u2019t your dad.

I said n a h, because you have a right to figure this out yourself. It's a little concerning that your dad might be paying his way into your life.

I wish you luck.", "NTA. There is so much trauma here and it sounds like everyone in this situation could benefit from some therapy to work through it.

They both did horrible things to each other. The difference is that your MOM continued to do horrible things to YOU. She lied about your parentage and tried to pass off her lover as your father.

These are things that CANNOT be undone - through her lies and omissions, she has ALTERED the course of your life! And yet she STILL takes NO OWNERSHIP of how she has VIOLATED you??!!  On top of that she is making demands and punishing you and your brother about all of this?! Unforgivable. Time to wake up and realize that she is still putting HERSELF first.

Just consider if that\u2019s why you are so quick to side with your bio Dad and overlook his part in what has happened? Keep in mind, had he not been abusive the situation may not have played out like it did.\n\nYou deserve a relationship with both of your parents but you don\u2019t need to pick sides.

Preying on someone's vulnerability by barraging them with gifts and flashy demonstrations of love to suck them in--as your father appears to be doing--is the classic abuser playbook.
