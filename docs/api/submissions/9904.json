Our son (19m) came out as gay five years ago, and of course we supported him completely. He has a boyfriend who he's been offical with since then, and he's a great kid and I'm glad they're happy together.\n\nNow here's the issue. My father-in-law is a very old and very homophobic man. He doesn't have social media so keeping him from finding out about our son being gay wasn't hard. He is leaving my husband and son each more than half a million when he dies, and has made it clear he would never give either of them the money if one of them was gay and they stayed in the family.\n\nSo with the wedding coming up we told pur son his boyfriend couldn't come. He tried to argue that he could just come as a friend, butvwe said no to that. We're worried our FIL would catch them holding hands or being cute with eachother and that would be that. The man is paranoid about his family being \"corrupted\" by \"The LGBT\".\n\nOur son is now refusing to go to the wedding, and even said if his boyfriend can't come he'll go nuclear and just tell his grandfather. We've tried to explain that he'd be throwing away so much money, but he doesn't care.", "created_utc": 1676347651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111td8q/wibta_for_not_letting_our_son_bring_his_boyfriend/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would like to believe that you do actually love and support your son.\n\nHowever, you and your husband have made it very clear that you will not protect him against your FIL, and that you desire the monetary reward for hiding his sexuality more than you value him being able to be himself and be happy. He even offered to just bring his boyfriend as a \"friend\" to try and please both sides, which shows that he has already made an effort to suppress himself and his relationship for YOUR sake. But you told him you won't allow that because it's too risky that the old man will figure out that they're together.\n\nEssentially, what you're doing here is prioritizing money over love. The love for your son, the love between your son and his partner, and the love between your FIL and your son.

He has a boyfriend who he's been offical with since then, and he's a great kid and I'm glad they're happy together.\n\nNow here's the issue. My father-in-law is a very old and very homophobic man. He doesn't have social media so keeping him from finding out about our son being gay wasn't hard. He is leaving my husband and son each more than half a million when he dies, and has made it clear he would never give either of them the money if one of them was gay and they stayed in the family.\n\nSo with the wedding coming up we told pur son his boyfriend couldn't come. He tried to argue that he could just come as a friend, butvwe said no to that. We're worried our FIL would catch them holding hands or being cute with eachother and that would be that. The man is paranoid about his family being \"corrupted\" by \"The LGBT\".\n\nOur son is now refusing to go to the wedding, and even said if his boyfriend can't come he'll go nuclear and just tell his grandfather. We've tried to explain that he'd be throwing away so much money, but he doesn't care.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
