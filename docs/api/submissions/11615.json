My brother ended up living with my aunt and uncle and I stayed alone at our house. My mom did provide financially and would visit every 3-4 months or so. \n\nI know it was tough for him as he slept on the floor as it was a small space, he also didn\u2019t have a room for himself and my aunt scolded him a lot. I felt sorry for him but I still couldn\u2019t take care of him.\n\nWhen I turned 18 I moved to another state for college, at 20 I opened a youtube channel and I was able to be financially independent, never stopped since then. At 23 I switched t a stable job and after 4 years I finally moved back home on my own, where my brother lives.\n\nMy aunt and my brother\u2019s relationship was tense and she always commented about how she would make him leave, which I think it hurtful to hear when you are so young and have nowhere to go. So I suggested he could come live with me as I wanted him to have his own room and just be comfortable. I agreed to take him to school and cook him breakfast daily as I know college is hard. In return I asked him to be respectful of this place.\n\nI am tired though, he is too messy. Toilet always has pee drops, his room is disgusting (this is a rented place) doesn\u2019t wash his dishes or whatever he uses, doesn\u2019t clean what he uses, waits for me to do laundry, whenever I ask him to do a basic chore I need to remind him 4-5 times. It is mentally exhausting, my mom also stopped sending money, so altough I just wanted to give him a place to stay, it is almost like he is now my child.\n\nI think he is old enough, as I already made money when I was 20.

He has a house to go to, but he would need to pay for his food as my mom provides too little, and also would need to take two buses to get to school.

There are some unexplored options before kicking him out if you want them.  \n\n\nMy recommendation would be to sit down with him. Not when you're already annoyed or upset with him. Have it written down and provide really strong feedback on what specifically you need him to change, how long he has to change it and what the consequences will be if he doesn't change.  \n\n\nYou shouldn't have to nag him all day every day to be a grown up. But you also shouldn't have to live feeling like you are abandoning him.  \n\n\nI hope it works out for you OP.", "No, I\u2019m saying he needs help. Yes, she was left behind as well. I get that. However, there\u2019s a bit of a difference between 15 and 9. At 9 a boy still wants hugs and cuddles from his mom and she abandoned him and her as well. I think it\u2019s amazing what she\u2019s done. If you look at my first post I did say he needed to get a job and then at the last one I said maybe 10 hours a week. \n\nHe\u2019s 20 and he\u2019s obviously depressed. He isn\u2019t lazy. Depression does that. It puts you down so far you don\u2019t always see a way up. He needs help and if he\u2019s abandoned again his life will continue on a trajectory that won\u2019t end well. \n\nEveryone\u2019s path is different because they\u2019re unique and handle things differently. Think about a 9 year old little boy being abandoned by his mom and then being put in a home where he wasn\u2019t liked and they didn\u2019t want him. What does that sound like? Like he was trash that they were putting up with. \n\nShe is amazing! I\u2019ve been in her shoes. I moved out on my own at 18, worked full time, went to university full time, paid rent, groceries, etc. all on my own because I didn\u2019t have a fail safe. However! That was my path. Not every situation is the same and to say that he\u2019s lazy is wrong. \n\nI\u2019m dealing with severe depression myself due to a medical diagnosis I\u2019m struggling with. It\u2019s so bad that I can go days without a shower and I\u2019m in bed most of the time. Am I lazy? No. I\u2019m struggling. I\u2019m working with my doctor and a very supportive husband who realize why this is happening. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is this\u2026nobody should ever be so quick to write another human being off. Our world can always use more compassion. \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA with his life being like that you would think he would be grateful and help out.", ">My mom left us to move with her partner to a different state, he was 9 and I was 15. My brother ended up living with my aunt and uncle and I stayed alone at our house.\n\nWtf? Your mom needs to deal with him since she abandoned both of you like a complete asshole. This isn't something you can solve because he either is doing all this because he's lazy or because he's depressed and you don't have to live in a hovel to try to fix what your mother did. NTA.", "INFO: Have you *taught* him? Has anyone actually *shown* him how to do these things, or *explained* **why** they need to be done\u2014to an acceptable bare minimum?\n\nIt sounds like this kid was not parented, but rather he was abused...", "Not the asshole. Calmly sit down with him, and explain he needs to start helping out or there will be consequences. Before you talk to him, think about the kind of consequences there will be if he doesn't help out. Explain why you can't be doing all the chores and picking up after him too, in a calm manner.", "YTA. \n\nHe's a 20 year old college boy. They're all slobs. \n\nDon't like his messy room? Close the door. \n\nStop cooking for him daily (just when you want to) and stop doing his laundry. He can do those things. Get separate dishes and flatware for him -- he has to clean his stuff. \n\nCommon area a mess? He cleans it or you toss it in his room and close the door. \n\nHis wet towel smells? Throw it in his room and pull out another dry towel. \n\nHe leaves dirty dishes in the sink? Put them in his room and close the door. \n\nYou're doing too much for him. Stop. \n\nIt may get worse before it gets better.", "He has a place to go, my mom\u2019s house is available for him. He just doesn\u2019t want to do chores\u2026", "Funniest part is she doesn\u2019t realize why me and my brother just don\u2019t care about her lol.", "It was definitely a trauma and one of the reasons I feel so bad for wanting to kick him out. \n\nHis therapist advised to get some treatment for his anxiety, he is not sure if he wants to though, and I don\u2019t think I could afford that on top of everything I already pay for him either.", "My mom lives 15 hours away so my brother wouldn\u2019t go as he is in the middle of college. My mom\u2019s partner (who is my brother\u2019s dad) is also financially abusive and he wouldn\u2019t let him live with them. \n\nHe can stay at my mom\u2019s house that she owns here though, it\u2019s fully furnished, he just never wanted to go there because he would have to be a functional adult who does basic chores.", "We have talked but I guess I never listed all the things here. \n\nMy mom is just a terrible mom, she became a stay at home wife to a married man so he provides too little. She doesn\u2019t want to work either. At this point she doesn\u2019t think she has done anything wrong altough she abandoned her kids lol. \n\nI should\u2019ve said, she gives me 1000 mxn when she visits. Our monthly groceries are around 6000 + around 2500 for gas. My monthly groceries used to be 1500 and never spent more than 800 on gas. So she provides, but too little, because she doesn\u2019t have more (and won\u2019t make any effort to earn). She just lives with whatever her partner gives her.", "Or you know he could move out.", "\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Then for sure NTA. Free ride is over.. offer to help him pack.", "You both deserved better.", "So he has another place to stay but wants to ruin your life because he doesn't want to take care of himself? Yeah, he needs to get out.", "Just curious, where do you live?", "North of Mexico!", "Gotcha! I was confused about the prices you gave for your bills. Lol. \n\nI know that everyone is saying to kick him out, man up, etc\u2026however, he\u2019s 20 and he\u2019s had a lot of people abandon him and beat him down. The way he\u2019s keeping his room, the bathroom, not doing his dishes, etc, are actually an outward expression of an inward belief  It\u2019s how he feels about himself. Truly. He feels like he isn\u2019t wanted, like he\u2019s trash because he was easily discarded by the one person who never should have, so he manifests that into his environment. It isn\u2019t a conscious decision, he isn\u2019t doing it on purpose. It\u2019s also partly trying to see when you\u2019re going to \u201cthrow him away.\u201d NONE of those are true, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what\u2019s churning away up there. Our minds are tricky, unfathomable things. \n\nAt this point I think he definitely needs some help. He\u2019s in college so they should have a mental help facility there that\u2019s free. My daughter is in her senior this year and her university has that. It\u2019s free because it\u2019s part of the tuition we have to pay. Please check that out to see if you can get him in there first. If not, start checking your area to see if there are free resources for him that would help. \n\nThen, he does need to get a job, but only a job that\u2019s about 10 hours a week to start. Something to engage him in the world, but not overwhelm him. It\u2019ll help his depression and his anxiety because once he sees there are people who will actually care for him, that will help. \n\nI know you\u2019re tired, I understand that as I helped raise my younger siblings (a lot of people thought I was their mom,) but please don\u2019t give up on him. Don\u2019t be another person who feeds into his self fulfilling prophecy of him being a piece of trash to be discarded. I know you love him and that you\u2019re tired, but try again, and again and again until he starts to see he isn\u2019t alone. I used to counsel teens and I\u2019ve seen this type of behavior before. Be the one who sticks\u2026even when you\u2019re exhausted. You can always message me for encouragement along the way.", "I know youe trying to be sympathetic for her brother, maybe this hits home for you I don't know\n But you just essentially told this girl that everything her brother does is not his fault and even though she's struggling she needs to continue supporting him. And  I'm but that's bullshit. Op was abandoned too and I would argue she probably had it worse. Yea the brother had to live with an aunt that does sound like she liked him too much. But I bet she cooked meals for him and things like that. OP had to live in a house by herself at the age of 15. There are adults that won't live by themselves because they can't handle it. But this girl did it, then got her life together, worked during college to support herself then found a decent job. They have both been through the ringer but I'd her brother is never forced to deal with his shit he never will. Your saying he's messy and and all this not because he's lazy, but because he can't help it. Yet he has a house he can go live in by himself but his excuse is he doesn't feel like doing chores. That sounds pretty lazy to me. Dude is an adult he needs to stand on his own a little bit. You think. She is spending 300 percent more on groceries solely because of him. Sorry but he needs to be working more than 10 hours a week. OP has done more than enough for a child she didn't birth.  It's time he starts pulling his weight so she can relax and start living her life."]}
