I have an older sister 19F but I\u2019ve never had a good bond with her neither does Rose. My sister 19F is always in her own world and she doesn\u2019t really care about us. So I try to be the big sister to Rose that I wish I could have had and I always spoil Rose with gifts and take her out whenever she wants. Yesterday I had 2 meetings and I would meet up with my friend for lunch after. I was at home getting ready when Rose woke up crying around 7:30am. I ran to her room and she was in tears and all shaken up. I asked her what's wrong and she said she had a nightmare where she lost everyone and was all alone. It was obvious she was all scared and she didn't want to go to school. I know that if it were up to my mom she would send Rose to school. I decided to take it easy on Rose and my parents allow me to take these decisions when they aren't home. I called Rose's school and called her in sick. Also it was a Friday and after that it's weekend and Rose didn't have any tests or whatsoever so I didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nI cancelled everything I had that day made her pancakes for breakfast and took Rose to her favorite theme park. After that I took her to get some new toys and lunch. I got her some sweets and called her favorite bakery and ordered her favorite chocolate cake. I took Rose home helped her take a shower and I told her to rest a bit and I'd be back in 20 minutes. I asked my neighbor to watch her till I got back and she did. I picked up the cake together with a box of brownies, cookies and muffins. I also got her some chocolate and ice cream and went home to surprise her. We watched movies together and cooked together. Then it was bedtime. As I tucked her in for bed I explained to her that she should be proud of herself for being so brave to not avoid her fears and she can come to me whenever she needs help or support. I also said that today could not happen every time she had a nightmare but I would always be there for her whenever she needed me. She understood and asked me if I could tell mom and I said I would. I told my mom and she said I should have just send her to school and now Rose will expect this every time she has a nightmare. My mom said Rose should get used to these and I can't keep treating her like this cause she will be a spoiled girl. I am wondering AITA for acting the way I did? Should I have just send her to school and told her to get over it?\n\nEdit: For the people saying TOOOO MUCH SUGAR: I only gave her small pieces of each some is still in the fridge we gave some to our neighbors and my parents and sister ate some. So no I did not put her in some sort of sugar coma or whatsoever.

Like, I just can't.\n\nThis is, to put it simply, *insane*. \n\nTheme parks, cake, brownies, cookies, muffins, chocolate, ice cream. That's just today. You mention in your comments that you buy her clothes, toys, and sweets (EVERYTIME YOU GO TO THE STORE WITH HER!!!!). You are actually spoiling her rotten.\n\nYou couldn't have comforted her and made her pancakes? If she really couldn't go to school (which I understand, mental health days are important), couldn't you have binged some movies and laid on the couch?\n\nYou also blew off work and lunch with friends...I mean, good grief. \n\nYou say she's the sweetest kid ever. Humble, knows how to share, etc. But I just can't see that lasting long with this behavior.\n\nI'm going to have to go with a soft YTA.", "Soft YTA. Your heart was in the right place, but holy sugar shock Batman! Surprised the poor kid didn\u2019t spend the weekend sick as a dog.", "YTA. I get it. Your sister had a bad dream. She still should have gone to school and you went way WAY over the top on the extras. Any one of those things would have been fine, but yeah toooooo much.", "YTA in the nicest way I can say it. Your mother is right; you took the fun and easy option instead of the harder, more responsible option. I was going to say N A H but then saw your ignorant response to the top comment; you actually do need a bit of a wake up call. Your actions were OTT and did not do anything to actually help with your sister's issue.", "YTA, for not comprehending that you didn't help your sister at all.\n\nI started to write this under someone else's comment, but I think it needs to be top level. Because you keep saying that you just wanted to give her a break and a little treat after her rough night . . . but you didn't just give her a break, or a treat. You bought her dozens of treats AND toys AND took her to a theme park. You overdid it beyond all reason or logic. Cake AND brownies AND chocolate AND ice cream? You're lucky you didn't make her really sick with all that! Like, that's a straight line to an upset stomach. And you taught her a TERRIBLE lesson about how to handle challenges.\n\nYou mention in the comments that you \"know that you spoil her a bit\" but then you say that you by her new toys and clothes and bags EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU'RE AT THE MALL OR ONLINE. That's not a little. It doesn't matter if she's a lovely child or if she shares . . . you're spoiling her rotten, and honestly, it's not even a nice thing to do for her, because when you buy a small child treats that often, they stop being special or exciting. They start just being what's normal and expected. You're actually ruining her ability to be excited and feel wonder about stuff by giving her new things all the time.\n\nAlso, your own age and immaturity is showing when you talk about how you \"explain to her\"  that \"not everyone has these things\", and you think that she gets it. She's 5 years old. As a former early childhood educator, I can assure you that even the smartest, kindest 5-year-old in the world isn't capable of fully comprehending any of that. Yes, she can nod and agree with you and tell you that she gets it. She can repeat it back to you. But she is a VERY YOUNG CHILD. She isn't developmentally able to understand ANY of what you're talking about. \n\nBasically, you've just taught her that when she has a hard time with something, the best way to make herself feel better is to eat twenty kinds of sugary things, and buy herself shiny new stuff she doesn't really need. That's not healthy, it's the opposite. \n\nYou were N-T-A for wanting to do something kind and give her a break . . . but you went about it in entirely the wrong way, and showed that you really know nothing at all about little kids, and that your parents shouldn't be trusting you with her. They let you make decisions, I suspect, in case of emergencies . . . and you showed that you have terrible judgement about what a real emergency is, or how to address a young child's needs. I wouldn't trust you to care for ANY kid. YTA.", "Your mom is the parent, not you. Yes it's important to comfort a child, but it's also important for them to go to school. Bad days are a thing, but sometimes routine can help with those bad days. Other times, yes we need a break. \n\nHonestly, it shouldn't be left up to you whether your sister goes to school or not.", "If you\u2019re going to fill this kind of role for your sister then you can\u2019t let her becoming upset and her tiny face and red eyes (as you say in a comment) affect you this much. \n\nKids have nightmares that deeply distress them. It happens. The solution is to tell them it\u2019s completely normal and just a dream and then give them their normal life. Not act as if it\u2019s something that needs lots of treatment to feel better. \n\nYTA", "It\u2019s nice that you want to take care of your sister, however you should not, nor she should you allow your sister to, blow off your responsibilities. You can comfort her, tell her you will do something extra special after school and plan it so she has something to look forward to and by the time school rolled around she would have forgotten about the nightmare. Try that next time. And since she\u2019s 5 I\u2019m sure there will be a next time.", " YTA if I explain why you can\u2019t do this to an adult, my head will surely explode.", "Yta", "NTA, but your mom is right.  Your sister should go to school, and it's your mom's decision, not yours.  Your heart was in the right place.", "You bought about a million too many treats. And she should have gone to school.

She is going to think she can get off school whenever she has a nightmare and that she can go crawling to her sister when her parents aren\u2019t giving her what they want. She would have felt better and gotten distracted probably as soon as she got into school. You\u2019re not her parent and if you continue this treatment you\u2019ll be creating a spoiled little girl who expects to get whatever she wants. One day she\u2019ll expect to move out of her parents and live with you since you give her everything she wants. Just because it was one time doesn\u2019t mean anything. You have NO IDEA how child development works, clearly.", "You went so overboard it's not even funny. I remember when my older sister did something special for me when I was younger, it was bringing me to the mall to get an ice cream cone. Or buy me a single toy. And I still remember it fondly. I can't imagine anyone going this over the top for even a birthday. She probably would've forgot the dream if you'd just comforted her, with words, not sweets, treats, a theme park and a movie. Your mother is right you need to calm down with spoiling her.", "YTA\n\nFirst, it's not your decision to send her to school or not. You way overstepped.\n\nSecond, you making Rosie not to develop and resilience. Nightmares happen, world does not stop. You spoiling her way to much, it will hurt her in long run.\n\nThird - you hugely overdid it . Can she expect people to do all that each time she has a nightmare? not quiet reading at home but tons of excitement and shitload of sugar - it will make nightmares coming more often.", "Honestly, you sound so immature that your parents genuinely need to sit you down and get you to learn your place. I\u2019m 19, and I have a younger sister who\u2019s 8, and I have my own fun little sister days with her. But NEVER would I go against my parents so fully and completely throw their authority out of the window for her. \n\nYou seem to think that you\u2019re justified because \u201cshe\u2019s cute\u201d or some rubbish like that. My little sister\u2019s cute too - that doesn\u2019t mean that I would spoil her rotten and act like a damn parent as if my own parents\u2019 have no authority any more. You are harming her own sense of humility, you are harming her relationship with her parents by showing her that you basically have as much authority as them, and you taught her that she deserves an award for a stupid nightmare?? What is wrong with you? When my sister wakes up crying in the middle of the night from a nightmare, I tuck her into bed with me and then make her pancakes in the morning. If she\u2019s been really good recently I buy her a few things, maybe some new clothes or a teddy. I don\u2019t go ahead and ruin her by spoiling her so awfully. You are not her damn parent, remember your place as her sister, and you\u2019ll both be better for it.", "At the moment I'm going with NAH, but your mom is right if you keep up this behavior your little sister will see it as something she is owed not something special between sisters. She is also right by saying you should have sent her to school, you are not her parent. There are better ways to be a loving supportive big sister while not turning little sister into a spoiled brat because you don't want life to upset her.", "NTA because you had good intentions, but honestly this sounds like overkill just for a nightmare. You could have made her a special breakfast, but once kids of this age get to school they will be distracted with teachers and classmates and playground fun and they certainly won't feel alone surrounded by all those people...I think your mom is correct to worry that she might expect this kind of treatment every time she feels bad, instead of learning how to self-regulate her feelings.", "YTA. This was totally irresponsible. \n\nCall in sick? Ok, fine. But when you call in sick from school/work, you do not then go to a theme park. Absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA but... Holy crap that sounds like a lot of sugar and presents. How often are you buying treats and toys for your sister?", "NTA, it was an once-off thing and you explained it to Rose.\n\nWIBTA if you do this often, but this one day will definitely harm no one and will be a cherished memory to Rose.", "You sound like a great and caring big sib! Still, there\u2019s probably a loving middle ground between \u201cGet over it\u201d and theme park, new toys, sweets, a whole cake, brownies, cookies, muffins, chocolate, and ice cream. \n\nAs I list that out, I\u2019m wondering if this is real LOL. Who ate all these treats? How are you paying for them and able to call out of (I\u2019m guessing) work meetings on a whim? Are you very rich? \n\nIf real, NTA on the \u201cspoiling\u201d the child front\u2014if it\u2019s doable, kids should have wonderful special days! A little confused on how the child was \u201cbrave to not avoid fears\u201d\u2014by having the dream in the first place?? And where are your parents? And the older sib? Did no one notice the child was gone all day doing holiday things until you informed a parent after bedtime? Am v puzzled by this story.", "I had a bad dream last night. Will you be my sister? I'm 48f.", "NAH\n\nYou're not the parent, but you did what you thought your sister needed. Missing one day of school at age 5 isn't going to hurt her academically.  \n\nOnce every couple of years, my daughter will be struggling, and I call her in sick for a mental health day.  There's a delicate balance - you can't miss school every time you have a bad dream, but having a special day and getting all the love from you can help carry her through when times are hard.", "NTA, we all need mental health days sometimes. And being able to tell others about your problems is very important.", "People are being way too harsh on you OP. You gave your sister a gift that she can look back on every time she\u2019s feeling scared or overwhelmed and remember how loved and cared for she is and use that as a source of strength to help her face those bad days. You\u2019ve already stated you know it can\u2019t happen all the time and you told her as much. A lot of people are making judgements about your little sister, saying she\u2019ll figure out she can manipulate you or what have you, but they don\u2019t know your sister. Don\u2019t let them tell you she\u2019s going to turn one day of indulgence into this Machiavellian plan to weasel her way out of school and into treats all the time. \n\nYou\u2019re an awesome big sister. Maybe a little indulgent with the sweets, but hey, we\u2019re only young once. I hope she didn\u2019t have any problems falling asleep that night after all that sugar lol\n\nNTA OP and you\u2019re the only one here who knows your sister. If you know she\u2019s not going to try to manipulate the situation then no harm, no foul, and she has a loving memory to look back on.", "NTA but you shouldn't make this into a habit. Do you think the fact that your little sister had perfect attendance when she was 5 will matter when ur much older? Just remember, when you're both grown up, you're going to think back to all your experiences in your life. You will both remember this moment and laugh. That's what matters in life. Not work, not school but unique experiences with loved ones.", "Aww OP. You\u2019re a very sweet sister, and Rose is very lucky to have you!\n\nBut your mom is right- you have to be careful not to set a bad precedent so Rose isn\u2019t expecting a big treat every time she feels bad. Not because she\u2019ll be spoiled, because if she\u2019s as sweet as you say, that\u2019s not a worry, but more because she\u2019s going to feel that because she has a bad day, she can flee her responsibilities.\nIt\u2019s okay that you didn\u2019t think about that as a possibility and just wanted to comfort your sister. It\u2019s not your job to think of all this stuff, that\u2019s something her mom should be worried about. But now that your mom has told you that you can\u2019t treat Rose that way, I hope you listen to her. Sometimes being a good sister is listening to your mom too.", "NTA but you should have called your mom before you just decided to keep her home.  Kids figure out pretty easily how to manipulate you even if you tell them not to get used to it.", "NTA. Your sister had a nightmare and your parents left you in charge. She seemed too anxious to go to school so you let her take a break. Mental health days are important because they give kids time to recharge. Whether the child is struggling with a mental health challenge or just having a rough week, a day off to recuperate can reduce stress and help them get back on track. You also kept in mind that mental health days should be one day, once in a while, and set limits and be clear about when kids can, and can't, take a day off. Shooting a quick text to your mom would\u2019ve been great so she knew where you were but other than that I don\u2019t think you did anything else wrong.", "NTA, if I had an older sister or a brother, I sure wish they were like you! One day out of school wouldn't make a difference, but you reminding her that she'll always have an older sister in her life, sure does. I would recommend not to make it a constant practice and do it once or twice a year max, but I don't see it as something horrendous, let alone as something that can make you an asshole \n\nP.S. I don't understand people who say that it's her mum's job to be the parent, do you guys even have a family? Or are you all autonomous robots that stick to the code that has been written in their heads?lmao She hasn't taken any major decision regarding Rose away from her mom, so simmer down, let people care about their loved ones and show them this care.", "NTA. When my mom would have rare off work for rain days (she worked construction), she would call me out of school and we would do thing together, like go to the aquarium. They were essentially mental health days for her, and it instilled the idea of of them for me as an adult. They didn't happen often, but they are still some of my favorite memories.", "NTA. Your lil sis is lucky to have you. Giving her the gift of knowing she has someone in her life who will always listen to her and take care of her is invaluable.\n\nWhatever concerns people here have with the sweets, activities, possibility of spoiling, and truancy (which she's FIVE lol), none of it makes you T A. Was it over the top? Maybe a little. Does that make you an a**hole? Definitely not.

What a kid is going to take from that is that this thing that happened to her is a huge deal. And that the way to deal with a huge deal is by lying, refusing school, buying a bunch of tat and eating junk food. If that doesn't happen the next time she has a nightmare, she's going to feel like now she's expected to handle this huge deal alone. \n\nScale back. Don't train Rose to expect Disneyland, a pony and fireworks as a response to the normal upsets of childhood. It does her a huge disservice.", "NAH you meant well and did a nice thing, however she should have been calmed down, reassured and gone to school.

Rose knows she can talk to me about any of her problems and not all of her problems are solved like this. Friday was a one time thing and she knows it. Even if I get her all those gifts she is grateful every time for them and she is the most humble kid ever. She shares her toys with everyone and how is it bad that I get her clothes and bags. Like doesn't every kid get these stuff. Ok I spoil her but thank god she knows how to be grateful. And she knows that when she has a hard time the best thing to do is talk about it. Ugh a 5 year old is not gonna be spoiled by 1 day in the theme park and some cookies. Also she's not gonna be spoiled by gifts I get her when she knows how to be grateful and appreciate everything she has.", "I have never done this before and my parents were at work. I have talked about this before with my parents and they said I could take these decisions if I had to. This was the only day I had to because Rose needed a break. She was terrified and she didn't feel safe.", "It was the first time this happened as far as she will remember probably. And I feel like every first time must be special and she's never gonna forget it so why not turn it into a great day. And yes obviously it can't happen all the time", "I will definitely not do this again and I told that to Rose as well. But idk what happened that day cause throughout the whole day she was anxious and repeatedly asked if she was safe and she would cry because she was scared. I didn't decide 1 2 3 I'm calling her sick I tried to get her ready to school but she was so anxious and it didn't feel right to send her to school in that state.", "Kid is FIVE\u2014that seems young to call skipping a day of preschool \u201cblowing off responsibilities\u201d.", "It was only a one time thing. Rose didn't feel safe not even in her room and she was scared. I wanted her to go to school but she was too shaken up and scared and I could see that she needed a break. I told her that this is a one time thing and could not happen every time. I explained to her that nightmares are normal and I just wanted her to have the day for herself and feel safe.", "Their sister is 5. Not an adult.", "I know but if you saw her tiny face and red eyes ughh. I just couldn't send her to school knowing she didn't even feel safe in her own room. She just needed a break and it was a Friday so I granted her 1 day of extra weekend. But on Saturday we did study together and made up for the lost day at school.", "It was the first time this happened and I told Rose it's also the last. It can't happen everytime.", "That's what I was thinking! Cake, brownies, chocolate, muffins and ice cream??? OP, this is way too much sugar for a five year old. ONE of those things would have been a treat.", "I have a good job and I live with my parents so I'm not paying rent etc. Sometimes I take Rose out for groceries for the house and get her treats. Rose is a smart kid and she knows the importance of healthy food as well so whenever I let her choose her snacks she always puts in fruits as well. And I get her something whenever I am at the mall or when I'm shopping online. I get her sweets/fruits/ clothes/ bags or just toys. I try to take her out every other weekend if I have time and otherwise sometimes during the week we take an evening to the movies. And if she wants something I get it for her. I went to Italy last month for something work related but I took an extra day for myself and took Rose with me. And I'm taking her to Disneyland Florida in August for 3 nights. I know I spoil her a little but I always tell her not to brag about it cause others might not have it and she knows it and she is the best at sharing.", "I work at an international company and I study but mostly I study from home. I also work for myself. I am not rich but my parents are financially stable and we've never had trouble affording stuff. My sister is never at home cause she works and goes to school as well and she loves to go out. My parents were at work and my mom didn't answer the phone and I did text her. I didn't let Rose eat all the sweets but just a small piece of each of them. My parents my sister and I ate some. The ice cream is still in the freezer and the cake is still in the fridge. Yesterday (Saturday) we studied with Rose after I came from work and made up for Friday and she deserved another piece of cake. We also gave some to our neighbors as we've been neighbors for even before I was born and they are amazing.", "AHHAHAHAH I mean sureee we should call you in sick for tomorrow and let's go to the moviessss ahahahhaahha", "I only gave her small pieces of all the sweets lol. The rest is still in the fridge. My parents and sister ate some and we gave some to our neighbors who we've been neighbors with for before I was even born. Gave her a glass of milk tucked her in for bed and read her bed time stories. In 10 minutes she was already sleeping like a baby and she woke me up the next day with a cookie and kisses :)", "It was the first time ever this happened and I told her this can not be an habit. She understood and the next day she woke me up with a cookie that i had bought for her. Seeing her appreciate it and knowing she felt safe and comfort made me happy and honestly I overworked the day after cause of the cancelled meetings but it didn't even matter lol.", "I mean I know. But I've already told my mom and Rose this is only a one time thing. It was a mental health day which is needed sometimes. But from now on I won't do it.", "My mom was at work so was my dad and my mom didn't answer the phone. My dad never wants to be called at work and also he has his phone on do not disturb and he knows how I am and never gets mad for doing what I felt was right however he does say afterwards like hey you did a great job but don't do it again.", "I called her and she didn't pick up my dad also never picks up. I did text my mom tho but she got mad when she got home.", ">I don't understand people who say that it's her mum's job to be the parent, do you guys even have a family?\n\nWhere I live, you can get in trouble as a parent for taking your kid out of school for too many days a year. You can be fined for being repeatedly late to school. So making a decision to have a party day could mean that the school refuses permission for a day off school for, say, a funeral. Or have to pay a fine. Or get flagged by the school as a negligent parent. So these choices can have consequences.", "In my country they have a reading test sometimes. Not really a test but the teacher will let them read in front of the class and she will base her advice of the end school year etc on that.", "...so why'd you buy all of it?", "My point is that taking her to a theme park, buying her toys, cakes etc. was a short term fix. Long term, this will not do her any favours; it was just a fun day out for you both. As I said, you took the irresponsible, fun, easy option.", "You're still out of line, and your solution and your comments are painfully immature and arrogant. Part of acting mature is having the humility to accept that some of your choices will be poor, and you simply have to own up and learn from them. \n\nThis would be the right moment for that.", "Yes, yes, you're 18 years old and you've got it all figured out - there's no need to absorb any of the four paragraphs of advice you just read from a former educator. You're smarter than everyone else.", "Bruh why even ask if u aren't going to accept the top comment?", "But you're not a parent. You are not the legal guardian for this type of thing. You could have easily called your parents.", "What decisions did they OK you to make? Apparently your parents didn't intend to include calling the girl in sick when she wasn't.", "You are not the parent!", "Why do you think first time must be special and that she\u2019s never gonna forget it? \n\nIt\u2019s no different to the first time she hurt herself or lost something etc. Do those need to be special? They don\u2019t for me, nor does this. If so, why? \n\nAs for her remembering it, really? Does anyone really remember their first nightmare? I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think people tend to remember that much of being 5 years old.", "Stop arguing with everyone telling you YTA. YTA and you way overstepped in this situation,", "She was anxious the whole day? I'm shocked that taking her out in public to less familiar places didn't help her feel more secure. /s\n\nYou keep saying your parents allow you to \"make these decisions when they aren't home.\" You also said you knew your mom would have sent Rose to school. Usually when someone trusts another person to make decisions, it is because that someone believes that other person will make decisions that align with the someone's values. You failed there.\n\nYou bought Rose toys and gave her cake, cookies, brownies, muffins, sweets, chocolate, and ice cream. This all sounds so ridiculous.\n\nYou should have calmed Rose down that morning. That should have been your first priority. Maybe have her be late to school if need be. You thinking that your only options were to do what you did it or send Rose to school telling her to just get over it, tells me you really should not be make decisions on behalf of Rose's parents.", "Nta.  I've had a few nightmares throughout my life that shook me bad like that, one was a vivid dream where I watched my kids die in a car crash. That one shook me for days.  Those ones can take awhile to shake off.  It sounds like your mom is pretty consistent with making her go to school, so one day (especially at that grade) really isnt going to do anything.  You gave your sister a golden day she will likely long remember.", "I think the commenter meant OP blowing off their own responsibilities rather than the 5-year-old", "What will you do next time she has a nightmare?", ">I wanted her to go to school but she was too shaken up and scared and I could see that she needed a break.\n\nWouldn't a movie day have sufficed? Not theme parks and a guaranteed upset stomach?", "A break from what she\u2019s 5 years old Jesus fucking Christ", "OP is the adult I\u2019m not explaining this to. 5 years is indeed to young to understand truancy.", "I'm completely sympathetic. I have a six year old who has had some terrible mornings, but five minutes after school starts, he's having a great time.  It's honestly not a big deal, and you're NTA for caring enough to spend time with your sister.  It's a cool thing you did, and don't do it anymore. \ud83d\ude09", "You need to take a step back and look at how you trying to be the big sister you dreamed of having is projecting onto your sister your wants, instead of actually seeing what she needs from a big sister. And that is just the stand out issue that is going on here.", "I only gave her a small piece of each and the rest is still in the fridge. My parents and sister ate some and we gave our neighbors some.", "You don't spoil her \"a little\", this is an insane amount of spoiling. I'm like...shocked, maybe even appalled(?) by how much stuff this 5 year old gets from you. You gotta cut back.", "You\u2019re 18 and your job sent you to Italy? And you brought your sister? And now you\u2019re taking her to Disney? Quite the job at 18 to have that type of work travel and money. Something doesn\u2019t add up\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.", "Really? You studied with a 5 year old?", "A++ sistering Rose is lucky to have you.", "It was the first time I ever did this. I have an older sister and I've never felt this safe or comfort with her. I don't want my little sister to grow up and being scared to come to me because she'll think I don't trust her or I won't protect her. Cause that is exactly how I feel and felt with my sister.", "Most schools have provisions for the death of a parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, and grandparents. Those days are excused. If not and it's up to the discretion of the administration and they deny it then IF it were to go to family court for truancy that would be taken into consideration by the judge. One mental health day, that's what it could be considered, is not going to break the bank unless there are already truancy issues. \n\nOP, NTA but that's way too much sugary stuff and activity for one day. She's still young and ice cream for breakfast and a picnic in the park would have been enough.", "They might, they might not, we don't have the information regarding such a policy in the school she goes to. But at the end of the day you can always argue that it wasn't the mother who took her out, since OP was the one who called the school. In fact, if such policy exists in that school, then they shouldn't be accepting OP's notice in the first place, saying that they can only accept it from the parents, not sisters, albeit the age.\n\nOn a side note, what a shitty policy! If the school is public it shouldn't have any business pulling shit like that, those parents literally pay for the whole school to function with their tax money and they have the audacity to fine for stupid stuff like that xD I do understand your point if we consider private schools, especially the elite kind though", "Because I can omg why is it such a big deal honestly. It's not like she ate everything.", "Classic.\n\n\u201cAITA?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what do you know?!?\u201d", "Hehehe. Nice", "OP isn\u2019t the parent, but the parents themselves already gave her permission to act in their stead. When someone has already told you that you can make a decision in their place you don\u2019t need to call them, they\u2019ve already placed their trust in your judgement. \n\nAnd OP did the right thing. \n\nEveryone gets overwhelmed from time to time. Sometimes we need reassurance that we aren\u2019t alone, that we are loved and cared for and supported. It was obvious that whatever the finer details of Rose\u2019s dream were, they left her feeling in doubt of these things. OP was an amazing big sister who put her little sister before everything else to give her a day just focussed on her happiness. She made it clear that it can\u2019t happen all the time. And you know what? Next time Rose has a bad dream or a day that she feels down and uncertain, all OP has to do is remind her of the wonderful day they spent together and how loved Rose is, and I\u2019m sure it will brighten her up considerably.", "My mom didn't pick up and my dad also doesn't pick up when at work. Which is the reason they allowed me to take these decisions if I was home and Rose needed something. Usually my mom is home but that day she started earlier cause originally I would've taken Rose to school.", "I agree.  Especially with taking her out for a day on the town.  If she got hurt OP has zero ability to make a medical decision because she is not a legal guardian", "It was the first time she ever felt so unsafe over a dream and she was so shaken up. If she looks back at this day I don't want her to feel bad or unsafe again but I want her to remember all the memories we made.", "I calmed her down and told her she could be late for school. But she kept getting scared every second she was alone. I just didn't want her to go to school when she didn't even feel safe in her own home.", "Remind her of Friday and how it all turned out to be great. Make her some great breakfast get her ready for school and make sure she feels safe. Friday was a day she will never forget and a day she can turn back to whenever she feels alone, scared or when she feels like she needs a break. She has always known she can tell me anything that's bothering her but now she is even more assured of that it will eventually all turn out to be great.", ">trying to be the big sister you dreamed of having \n\nExactly. Also, this is kind of unfair to OP\u2019s older sister. She\u2019s only a year older than OP. If OP had a nightmare at 5, what exactly was her 6 year old sister supposed to do? Unless she was straight up mean to OP, I don\u2019t exactly know what she was expecting from her sister who was practically the same age.", "Honestly, a small piece of cake, cookies, muffins, brownies, chocolate snd ice cream is still a ton of sugar.  What was the the point of getting all those things? Rose wasn't going look at the cake and ice cream and think \"No brownies?!? I guess she doesn't love me.\"", "I have been working since I was 15. Started a good job at 16 because of my study. Finished the study at the end of 17. Now working in the direction I studied making more money. Started my own online business with my parents who helped me set up and I'm studying from home mostly in another direction. I work for an international company so I travel for work sometimes. And sometimes I travel for my own business like gallery's etc. to get clients. Well what can I say I work hard to achieve the future I want.", "OMG study as in reading books. Learning new words. Pronounces of words. Really what else could I have studied with a freaking 5 year old.", "You know that it's possible to provide comfort without going to a theme park, having a cake specially made, feeding her cake, brownies, sweets, et cetera?\n\nComfort is not found in material stuff. It's listening, telling them you'll be there for them, and then following through on that.", "Have you considered you're spoiling her a bit too much because you resent not having an older sister that looked out for you? You can look out for your little sister without going that far everytime she needs you", "I was thinking of a mum friend who was not able to get her kids out for the funeral of a close family friend. And they didn't even have many off days, but they did have quite a few late starts. \n\nWhen me and my ex split up, the teacher told me to take my son away and start the weekend early, and put it as a mental health day. So I know it is totally possible (we are not usually late or playing hooky, though!) But that was a slightly more legitimate reason than a bad dream.", ">They might, they might not, we don't have the information regarding such a policy in the school she goes to.\n\nI wasn't suggesting that it is the policy at OP's sister's school. Just that it is the case in the country I live in. And that it is one of the reasons why I also said it wasn't her decision to make. \n\n>those parents literally pay for the whole school to function with their tax money and they have the audacity to fine for stupid stuff like that xD I do understand your point if we consider private schools, especially the elite kind though\n\nIt's to try and make sure people sent their kids to school. It's actually quite important and beneficial in some cases. Extremely frustrating in others. \n\nPrivate schools generally don't give a damn! You are already paying them, they have to do less work if you don't show up, and they're buying a lot of the grades anyway!", "Because that shit is so EXPENSIVE. How much money do you make? Are you a millionaire? Because I can not fathom shelling out money for so many treats in one day.", "The parents may have given some sort of permission however she still should not have taken the girl out gallivanting.  If there had been an accident or injury that required medical the sister is not a legal guardian who can make those decisions.", "I find it hard to believe that a school is going to accept a sibling calling to pull a kid out of school.", "She\u2019s 5. She won\u2019t remember that long.", "Even if she cries, clings to you and begs for another special sister day?", "Literally. I'm so confused why OP got all this stuff.", "Who was watching the kid while you were working in Italy?", "Cool. I understood exactly what you meant, my point is you referred to it in a weirdly foolish and self-important way lol \n\nLook, if you\u2019re going to be an influential adult in her life you need to help her *self regulate*. At 5, that development is really important. \n\nA few treats and a mental health day? Awesome. \n\nYou went *over the top* and the issue is, when compared to something like a birthday party, it\u2019s pretty extreme. You\u2019re sort of skewing her perception of *special* and you also make it hard for anyone to match that. \n\nMy point is, you\u2019re not just indulging her. **You\u2019re indulging yourself.** I get you have a hard relationship with your older sister, but *pointedly* spoiling your younger sister to this degree doesn\u2019t really fix that issue, and it certainly isn\u2019t necessary to your younger sister\u2019s happiness.", "I know and I did all of those things as well. But since I already called her in sick I thought why not have one hell of a day and make some good memories. The next day she woke me up with cookies that I bought for her and gave me kisses. I did overwork because I cancelled my meetings for her but honestly it didn't even matter lol.", "This. The degree of the spoiling seems weirdly pointed.", "I'd have taken them anyway. I took my kids to their friends dad's funeral. They had been playing with their friend half an hour before his dad had a fatal heart attack. They were real shook and wanted to go so I took them. It wasn't excused but my kids didn't have any unexcused absences. \n\nMy son had to be declared medically fragile, which he is, because of missing school. He had doctors notes for every absence but they still sent us letters for truancy. They couldn't do anything legally, but they sure liked sending their letters anyway. In that state they didn't have excused absences. If you went over 8 days for any reason they started their legal crap. They can't touch you if medically fragile though.", "I guess it all comes down to the country you come from, as my experience with public and private schools was completely different to what you're describing.\n\nBut I still stand by the point that if a school has such a policy, then they shouldn't accept a phone call from a sister as a legitimate one and should demand that parents call instead", "My parents have always been well off. I finished one study I'm doing another one now. I have a good job. And I work for myself as well. No I'm no millionaire but yes I can afford a lot of stuff for myself and my family.", "By that logic, that could have happened at school as well. The school would have had to call the parents in the event something happened while she was on their premises. Either way, the parents would be called if there was a medical emergency", "Sadly, some schools really don't care.  In HS, I occasionally helped one of the admins answer phones, and you'd be surprised how many students called themselves out.  I mentioned it once, and the admin waved it off that it happens all the time.", "Honestly they didn't even ask who I was but if they would have I would've said I was her mom lol.", "You don't know her. She's never done something like that. She understands that not everything can happen always. So that is something not to worry about lol.", "I kind of wonder if there's a spending problem at play here. Like, the OP has some kind of fixation on shopping and justifies it by things being for the sister. Buying toys every time she's out or online, getting more sweets than anyone can logically eat, etc. I used to have issues like this in my manic phases; I wanted to spend, and I knew I couldn't justify it for myself, so I'd buy stuff for my kids so I didn't feel guilty about it. It took a lot of therapy to break the habit.", "The hotel I was staying had childcare. I could put in special requests so I requested a hotel with child care and a day extra. Paid the difference out of pocket. She only stayed at childcare for not even 1 hole day. And the other day she was with me as that day was for us.", "You did well, stop beating yourself over it!", ">But I still stand by the point that if a school has such a policy, then they shouldn't accept a phone call from a sister as a legitimate one and should demand that parents call instead\n\nThey don't really care. If the person who is acting as a guardian fails the child, it is still the fault of the parent for putting their child in that guardian's care. \n\nThe number of 2 week skiing vacations the kids from my private school went on during term time was mad. Particularly as their parents could more than afford the peak rates for flights and hotels. The ludicrously rich got to travel in off-peak season because they'd essentially bought off the school. And everyone at my grammar school (Not private) had to go in the holidays for fear of getting their parents in trouble, and had to pay for the pricey flights. It's a slightly mad system.", "I\u2019m just of the opinion it was a bit irresponsible and probably an overreaction to keep a 5 yr old from school.   Personally I think it was an excuse for OP to fuck off from work", "But you're not.", "You said you've never done this before, so of COURSE she hasn't acted like that. \n\nBut, OP, what if it *does?* What, despite all apparent odds, she does ask. What then? Will you cave? Will you tell her no?\n\nI really don't think you understand the potential consequences of this day.", "Okay, but she's never been so upset by a dream before either, right? So, things that she's never done before can still happen. If this does happen, what will your response be?", "Meh, as I said, it's a shitty policy, I don't agree with it to begin with\ud83d\ude05 needs to be reformed", "Who cares", "I don't really see how one day can cause such a drama. You think I never tell her no? Obviously I tell her no and she knows that when she is told no not to ask again.", "I don't think you understand. People can have bad dreams that leave them shaken and scared. Whether it's a child of 5 or an adult. It happens. I gave her one mental health day. it's not like I do this often or something. That day she needed me and I was there for her. That's it.", "I don\u2019t think you understand how child development works. Their brains are like sponges. They learn lessons in ways that are not obvious to adults. \n\nKnowing that she has people who care for her and are there for her is important. But so is self-soothing. Comforting your sister was not wrong in the slightest. But you went so beyond overboard with it that she didn\u2019t learn a thing about self-soothing. She learned the opposite.\n\nEven your mom is concerned you\u2019re just teaching your sister to expect something this excessive. Do you just think your mom is full of shit?"]}
