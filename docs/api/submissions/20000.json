I have an older sister 19F but I\u2019ve never had a good bond with her neither does Rose. My sister 19F is always in her own world and she doesn\u2019t really care about us. So I try to be the big sister to Rose that I wish I could have had and I always spoil Rose with gifts and take her out whenever she wants. Yesterday I had 2 meetings and I would meet up with my friend for lunch after. I was at home getting ready when Rose woke up crying around 7:30am. I ran to her room and she was in tears and all shaken up. I asked her what's wrong and she said she had a nightmare where she lost everyone and was all alone. It was obvious she was all scared and she didn't want to go to school. I know that if it were up to my mom she would send Rose to school. I decided to take it easy on Rose and my parents allow me to take these decisions when they aren't home. I called Rose's school and called her in sick. Also it was a Friday and after that it's weekend and Rose didn't have any tests or whatsoever so I didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nI cancelled everything I had that day made her pancakes for breakfast and took Rose to her favorite theme park. After that I took her to get some new toys and lunch. I got her some sweets and called her favorite bakery and ordered her favorite chocolate cake. I took Rose home helped her take a shower and I told her to rest a bit and I'd be back in 20 minutes. I asked my neighbor to watch her till I got back and she did. I picked up the cake together with a box of brownies, cookies and muffins. I also got her some chocolate and ice cream and went home to surprise her. We watched movies together and cooked together. Then it was bedtime. As I tucked her in for bed I explained to her that she should be proud of herself for being so brave to not avoid her fears and she can come to me whenever she needs help or support. I also said that today could not happen every time she had a nightmare but I would always be there for her whenever she needed me. She understood and asked me if I could tell mom and I said I would. I told my mom and she said I should have just send her to school and now Rose will expect this every time she has a nightmare. My mom said Rose should get used to these and I can't keep treating her like this cause she will be a spoiled girl. I am wondering AITA for acting the way I did? Should I have just send her to school and told her to get over it?\n\nEdit: For the people saying TOOOO MUCH SUGAR: I only gave her small pieces of each some is still in the fridge we gave some to our neighbors and my parents and sister ate some. So no I did not put her in some sort of sugar coma or whatsoever.

Like, I just can't.\n\nThis is, to put it simply, *insane*. \n\nTheme parks, cake, brownies, cookies, muffins, chocolate, ice cream. That's just today. You mention in your comments that you buy her clothes, toys, and sweets (EVERYTIME YOU GO TO THE STORE WITH HER!!!!). You are actually spoiling her rotten.\n\nYou couldn't have comforted her and made her pancakes? If she really couldn't go to school (which I understand, mental health days are important), couldn't you have binged some movies and laid on the couch?\n\nYou also blew off work and lunch with friends...I mean, good grief. \n\nYou say she's the sweetest kid ever. Humble, knows how to share, etc. But I just can't see that lasting long with this behavior.\n\nI'm going to have to go with a soft YTA.", "Soft YTA. Your heart was in the right place, but holy sugar shock Batman! Surprised the poor kid didn\u2019t spend the weekend sick as a dog.", "YTA. I get it. Your sister had a bad dream. She still should have gone to school and you went way WAY over the top on the extras. Any one of those things would have been fine, but yeah toooooo much.", "YTA in the nicest way I can say it. Your mother is right; you took the fun and easy option instead of the harder, more responsible option. I was going to say N A H but then saw your ignorant response to the top comment; you actually do need a bit of a wake up call. Your actions were OTT and did not do anything to actually help with your sister's issue.", "YTA, for not comprehending that you didn't help your sister at all.\n\nI started to write this under someone else's comment, but I think it needs to be top level. Because you keep saying that you just wanted to give her a break and a little treat after her rough night . . . but you didn't just give her a break, or a treat. You bought her dozens of treats AND toys AND took her to a theme park. You overdid it beyond all reason or logic. Cake AND brownies AND chocolate AND ice cream? You're lucky you didn't make her really sick with all that! Like, that's a straight line to an upset stomach. And you taught her a TERRIBLE lesson about how to handle challenges.\n\nYou mention in the comments that you \"know that you spoil her a bit\" but then you say that you by her new toys and clothes and bags EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU'RE AT THE MALL OR ONLINE. That's not a little. It doesn't matter if she's a lovely child or if she shares . . . you're spoiling her rotten, and honestly, it's not even a nice thing to do for her, because when you buy a small child treats that often, they stop being special or exciting. They start just being what's normal and expected. You're actually ruining her ability to be excited and feel wonder about stuff by giving her new things all the time.\n\nAlso, your own age and immaturity is showing when you talk about how you \"explain to her\"  that \"not everyone has these things\", and you think that she gets it. She's 5 years old. As a former early childhood educator, I can assure you that even the smartest, kindest 5-year-old in the world isn't capable of fully comprehending any of that. Yes, she can nod and agree with you and tell you that she gets it. She can repeat it back to you. But she is a VERY YOUNG CHILD. She isn't developmentally able to understand ANY of what you're talking about. \n\nBasically, you've just taught her that when she has a hard time with something, the best way to make herself feel better is to eat twenty kinds of sugary things, and buy herself shiny new stuff she doesn't really need. That's not healthy, it's the opposite. \n\nYou were N-T-A for wanting to do something kind and give her a break . . . but you went about it in entirely the wrong way, and showed that you really know nothing at all about little kids, and that your parents shouldn't be trusting you with her. They let you make decisions, I suspect, in case of emergencies . . . and you showed that you have terrible judgement about what a real emergency is, or how to address a young child's needs. I wouldn't trust you to care for ANY kid. YTA.", "Your mom is the parent, not you. Yes it's important to comfort a child, but it's also important for them to go to school. Bad days are a thing, but sometimes routine can help with those bad days. Other times, yes we need a break. \n\nHonestly, it shouldn't be left up to you whether your sister goes to school or not.", "If you\u2019re going to fill this kind of role for your sister then you can\u2019t let her becoming upset and her tiny face and red eyes (as you say in a comment) affect you this much. \n\nKids have nightmares that deeply distress them. It happens. The solution is to tell them it\u2019s completely normal and just a dream and then give them their normal life. Not act as if it\u2019s something that needs lots of treatment to feel better. \n\nYTA", "It\u2019s nice that you want to take care of your sister, however you should not, nor should you allow your sister to, blow off your responsibilities. You can comfort her, tell her you will do something extra special after school and plan it so she has something to look forward to and by the time school rolled around she would have forgotten about the nightmare. Try that next time. And since she\u2019s 5 I\u2019m sure there will be a next time.", " YTA if I explain why you can\u2019t do this to an adult, my head will surely explode.", "Yta", "NTA, but your mom is right.  Your sister should go to school, and it's your mom's decision, not yours.  Your heart was in the right place.", "You bought about a million too many treats. And she should have gone to school.

She is going to think she can get off school whenever she has a nightmare and that she can go crawling to her sister when her parents aren\u2019t giving her what they want. She would have felt better and gotten distracted probably as soon as she got into school. You\u2019re not her parent and if you continue this treatment you\u2019ll be creating a spoiled little girl who expects to get whatever she wants. One day she\u2019ll expect to move out of her parents and live with you since you give her everything she wants. Just because it was one time doesn\u2019t mean anything. You have NO IDEA how child development works, clearly.", "You went so overboard it's not even funny. I remember when my older sister did something special for me when I was younger, it was bringing me to the mall to get an ice cream cone. Or buy me a single toy. And I still remember it fondly. I can't imagine anyone going this over the top for even a birthday. She probably would've forgot the dream if you'd just comforted her, with words, not sweets, treats, a theme park and a movie. Your mother is right you need to calm down with spoiling her.", "YTA\n\nFirst, it's not your decision to send her to school or not. You way overstepped.\n\nSecond, you making Rosie not to develop and resilience. Nightmares happen, world does not stop. You spoiling her way to much, it will hurt her in long run.\n\nThird - you hugely overdid it . Can she expect people to do all that each time she has a nightmare? not quiet reading at home but tons of excitement and shitload of sugar - it will make nightmares coming more often.", "Honestly, you sound so immature that your parents genuinely need to sit you down and get you to learn your place. I\u2019m 19, and I have a younger sister who\u2019s 8, and I have my own fun little sister days with her. But NEVER would I go against my parents so fully and completely throw their authority out of the window for her. \n\nYou seem to think that you\u2019re justified because \u201cshe\u2019s cute\u201d or some rubbish like that. My little sister\u2019s cute too - that doesn\u2019t mean that I would spoil her rotten and act like a damn parent as if my own parents\u2019 have no authority any more. You are harming her own sense of humility, you are harming her relationship with her parents by showing her that you basically have as much authority as them, and you taught her that she deserves an award for a stupid nightmare?? What is wrong with you? When my sister wakes up crying in the middle of the night from a nightmare, I tuck her into bed with me and then make her pancakes in the morning. If she\u2019s been really good recently I buy her a few things, maybe some new clothes or a teddy. I don\u2019t go ahead and ruin her by spoiling her so awfully. You are not her damn parent, remember your place as her sister, and you\u2019ll both be better for it.", "At the moment I'm going with NAH, but your mom is right if you keep up this behavior your little sister will see it as something she is owed not something special between sisters. She is also right by saying you should have sent her to school, you are not her parent. There are better ways to be a loving supportive big sister while not turning little sister into a spoiled brat because you don't want life to upset her.", "NTA because you had good intentions, but honestly this sounds like overkill just for a nightmare. You could have made her a special breakfast, but once kids of this age get to school they will be distracted with teachers and classmates and playground fun and they certainly won't feel alone surrounded by all those people...I think your mom is correct to worry that she might expect this kind of treatment every time she feels bad, instead of learning how to self-regulate her feelings.", "YTA. This was totally irresponsible. \n\nCall in sick? Ok, fine. But when you call in sick from school/work, you do not then go to a theme park. Absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA but... Holy crap that sounds like a lot of sugar and presents. How often are you buying treats and toys for your sister?", "NTA, it was an once-off thing and you explained it to Rose.\n\nWIBTA if you do this often, but this one day will definitely harm no one and will be a cherished memory to Rose.", "You sound like a great and caring big sib! Still, there\u2019s probably a loving middle ground between \u201cGet over it\u201d and theme park, new toys, sweets, a whole cake, brownies, cookies, muffins, chocolate, and ice cream. \n\nAs I list that out, I\u2019m wondering if this is real LOL.

Are you very rich? \n\nIf real, NTA on the \u201cspoiling\u201d the child front\u2014if it\u2019s doable, kids should have wonderful special days! A little confused on how the child was \u201cbrave to not avoid fears\u201d\u2014by having the dream in the first place?? And where are your parents? And the older sib?

I'm 48f.", "NAH\n\nYou're not the parent, but you did what you thought your sister needed. Missing one day of school at age 5 isn't going to hurt her academically.  \n\nOnce every couple of years, my daughter will be struggling, and I call her in sick for a mental health day.  There's a delicate balance - you can't miss school every time you have a bad dream, but having a special day and getting all the love from you can help carry her through when times are hard.", "NTA, we all need mental health days sometimes. And being able to tell others about your problems is very important.", "People are being way too harsh on you OP. You gave your sister a gift that she can look back on every time she\u2019s feeling scared or overwhelmed and remember how loved and cared for she is and use that as a source of strength to help her face those bad days. You\u2019ve already stated you know it can\u2019t happen all the time and you told her as much. A lot of people are making judgements about your little sister, saying she\u2019ll figure out she can manipulate you or what have you, but they don\u2019t know your sister.

You\u2019re a very sweet sister, and Rose is very lucky to have you!\n\nBut your mom is right- you have to be careful not to set a bad precedent so Rose isn\u2019t expecting a big treat every time she feels bad. Not because she\u2019ll be spoiled, because if she\u2019s as sweet as you say, that\u2019s not a worry, but more because she\u2019s going to feel that because she has a bad day, she can flee her responsibilities.\nIt\u2019s okay that you didn\u2019t think about that as a possibility and just wanted to comfort your sister. It\u2019s not your job to think of all this stuff, that\u2019s something her mom should be worried about. But now that your mom has told you that you can\u2019t treat Rose that way, I hope you listen to her. Sometimes being a good sister is listening to your mom too.", "NTA but you should have called your mom before you just decided to keep her home.  Kids figure out pretty easily how to manipulate you even if you tell them not to get used to it.", "NTA. Your sister had a nightmare and your parents left you in charge. She seemed too anxious to go to school so you let her take a break. Mental health days are important because they give kids time to recharge. Whether the child is struggling with a mental health challenge or just having a rough week, a day off to recuperate can reduce stress and help them get back on track. You also kept in mind that mental health days should be one day, once in a while, and set limits and be clear about when kids can, and can't, take a day off. Shooting a quick text to your mom would\u2019ve been great so she knew where you were but other than that I don\u2019t think you did anything else wrong.", "NTA, if I had an older sister or a brother, I sure wish they were like you! One day out of school wouldn't make a difference, but you reminding her that she'll always have an older sister in her life, sure does. I would recommend not to make it a constant practice and do it once or twice a year max, but I don't see it as something horrendous, let alone as something that can make you an asshole \n\nP.S. I don't understand people who say that it's her mum's job to be the parent, do you guys even have a family? Or are you all autonomous robots that stick to the code that has been written in their heads?lmao She hasn't taken any major decision regarding Rose away from her mom, so simmer down, let people care about their loved ones and show them this care.", "NTA. When my mom would have rare off work for rain days (she worked construction), she would call me out of school and we would do thing together, like go to the aquarium. They were essentially mental health days for her, and it instilled the idea of of them for me as an adult. They didn't happen often, but they are still some of my favorite memories.", "NTA. Your lil sis is lucky to have you. Giving her the gift of knowing she has someone in her life who will always listen to her and take care of her is invaluable.\n\nWhatever concerns people here have with the sweets, activities, possibility of spoiling, and truancy (which she's FIVE lol), none of it makes you T A. Was it over the top? Maybe a little. Does that make you an a**hole? Definitely not.

What a kid is going to take from that is that this thing that happened to her is a huge deal. And that the way to deal with a huge deal is by lying, refusing school, buying a bunch of tat and eating junk food. If that doesn't happen the next time she has a nightmare, she's going to feel like now she's expected to handle this huge deal alone. \n\nScale back. Don't train Rose to expect Disneyland, a pony and fireworks as a response to the normal upsets of childhood. It does her a huge disservice.", "NAH you meant well and did a nice thing, however she should have been calmed down, reassured and gone to school.

Rose knows she can talk to me about any of her problems and not all of her problems are solved like this. Friday was a one time thing and she knows it. Even if I get her all those gifts she is grateful every time for them and she is the most humble kid ever. She shares her toys with everyone and how is it bad that I get her clothes and bags. Like doesn't every kid get these stuff. Ok I spoil her but thank god she knows how to be grateful. And she knows that when she has a hard time the best thing to do is talk about it. Ugh a 5 year old is not gonna be spoiled by 1 day in the theme park and some cookies. Also she's not gonna be spoiled by gifts I get her when she knows how to be grateful and appreciate everything she has.", "I have never done this before and my parents were at work. I have talked about this before with my parents and they said I could take these decisions if I had to. This was the only day I had to because Rose needed a break. She was terrified and she didn't feel safe.", "It was the first time this happened as far as she will remember probably. And I feel like every first time must be special and she's never gonna forget it so why not turn it into a great day. And yes obviously it can't happen all the time", "I will definitely not do this again and I told that to Rose as well. But idk what happened that day cause throughout the whole day she was anxious and repeatedly asked if she was safe and she would cry because she was scared. I didn't decide 1 2 3 I'm calling her sick I tried to get her ready to school but she was so anxious and it didn't feel right to send her to school in that state.", "Kid is FIVE\u2014that seems young to call skipping a day of preschool \u201cblowing off responsibilities\u201d.", "It was only a one time thing. Rose didn't feel safe not even in her room and she was scared. I wanted her to go to school but she was too shaken up and scared and I could see that she needed a break.

I explained to her that nightmares are normal and I just wanted her to have the day for herself and feel safe.", "Their sister is 5. Not an adult.", "I know but if you saw her tiny face and red eyes ughh. I just couldn't send her to school knowing she didn't even feel safe in her own room. She just needed a break and it was a Friday so I granted her 1 day of extra weekend. But on Saturday we did study together and made up for the lost day at school.", "It was the first time this happened and I told Rose it's also the last. It can't happen everytime.", "That's what I was thinking! Cake, brownies, chocolate, muffins and ice cream??? OP, this is way too much sugar for a five year old. ONE of those things would have been a treat.", "I have a good job and I live with my parents so I'm not paying rent etc. Sometimes I take Rose out for groceries for the house and get her treats. Rose is a smart kid and she knows the importance of healthy food as well so whenever I let her choose her snacks she always puts in fruits as well. And I get her something whenever I am at the mall or when I'm shopping online. I get her sweets/fruits/ clothes/ bags or just toys. I try to take her out every other weekend if I have time and otherwise sometimes during the week we take an evening to the movies. And if she wants something I get it for her. I went to Italy last month for something work related but I took an extra day for myself and took Rose with me. And I'm taking her to Disneyland Florida in August for 3 nights. I know I spoil her a little but I always tell her not to brag about it cause others might not have it and she knows it and she is the best at sharing.", "I work at an international company and I study but mostly I study from home. I also work for myself. I am not rich but my parents are financially stable and we've never had trouble affording stuff. My sister is never at home cause she works and goes to school as well and she loves to go out. My parents were at work and my mom didn't answer the phone and I did text her. I didn't let Rose eat all the sweets but just a small piece of each of them. My parents my sister and I ate some. The ice cream is still in the freezer and the cake is still in the fridge. Yesterday (Saturday) we studied with Rose after I came from work and made up for Friday and she deserved another piece of cake. We also gave some to our neighbors as we've been neighbors for even before I was born and they are amazing.", "AHHAHAHAH I mean sureee we should call you in sick for tomorrow and let's go to the moviessss ahahahhaahha", "I only gave her small pieces of all the sweets lol. The rest is still in the fridge. My parents and sister ate some and we gave some to our neighbors who we've been neighbors with for before I was even born. Gave her a glass of milk tucked her in for bed and read her bed time stories. In 10 minutes she was already sleeping like a baby and she woke me up the next day with a cookie and kisses :)", "It was the first time ever this happened and I told her this can not be an habit. She understood and the next day she woke me up with a cookie that i had bought for her. Seeing her appreciate it and knowing she felt safe and comfort made me happy and honestly I overworked the day after cause of the cancelled meetings but it didn't even matter lol.", "I mean I know. But I've already told my mom and Rose this is only a one time thing. It was a mental health day which is needed sometimes. But from now on I won't do it.", "My mom was at work so was my dad and my mom didn't answer the phone. My dad never wants to be called at work and also he has his phone on do not disturb and he knows how I am and never gets mad for doing what I felt was right however he does say afterwards like hey you did a great job but don't do it again.", "I called her and she didn't pick up my dad also never picks up. I did text my mom tho but she got mad when she got home.", ">I don't understand people who say that it's her mum's job to be the parent, do you guys even have a family?\n\nWhere I live, you can get in trouble as a parent for taking your kid out of school for too many days a year. You can be fined for being repeatedly late to school. So making a decision to have a party day could mean that the school refuses permission for a day off school for, say, a funeral. Or have to pay a fine. Or get flagged by the school as a negligent parent. So these choices can have consequences.", "In my country they have a reading test sometimes. Not really a test but the teacher will let them read in front of the class and she will base her advice of the end school year etc on that.", "...so why'd you buy all of it?", "My point is that taking her to a theme park, buying her toys, cakes etc. was a short term fix. Long term, this will not do her any favours; it was just a fun day out for you both. As I said, you took the irresponsible, fun, easy option.", "You're still out of line, and your solution and your comments are painfully immature and arrogant. Part of acting mature is having the humility to accept that some of your choices will be poor, and you simply have to own up and learn from them. \n\nThis would be the right moment for that.\n\nCommenting as a parent and well versed in early childhood development.

They don\u2019t for me, nor does this. If so, why? \n\nAs for her remembering it, really? Does anyone really remember their first nightmare? I don\u2019t.

I'm shocked that taking her out in public to less familiar places didn't help her feel more secure. /s\n\nYou keep saying your parents allow you to \"make these decisions when they aren't home.\" You also said you knew your mom would have sent Rose to school. Usually when someone trusts another person to make decisions, it is because that someone believes that other person will make decisions that align with the someone's values. You failed there.\n\nYou bought Rose toys and gave her cake, cookies, brownies, muffins, sweets, chocolate, and ice cream. This all sounds so ridiculous.\n\nYou should have calmed Rose down that morning. That should have been your first priority. Maybe have her be late to school if need be.

I've had a few nightmares throughout my life that shook me bad like that, one was a vivid dream where I watched my kids die in a car crash. That one shook me for days.

If not and it's up to the discretion of the administration and they deny it then IF it were to go to family court for truancy that would be taken into consideration by the judge. One mental health day, that's what it could be considered, is not going to break the bank unless there are already truancy issues. \n\nOP, NTA but that's way too much sugary stuff and activity for one day. She's still young and ice cream for breakfast and a picnic in the park would have been enough.", "They might, they might not, we don't have the information regarding such a policy in the school she goes to.

Sometimes we need reassurance that we aren\u2019t alone, that we are loved and cared for and supported. It was obvious that whatever the finer details of Rose\u2019s dream were, they left her feeling in doubt of these things.

At 5, that development is really important. \n\nA few treats and a mental health day? Awesome. \n\nYou went *over the top* and the issue is, when compared to something like a birthday party, it\u2019s pretty extreme.

He had doctors notes for every absence but they still sent us letters for truancy. They couldn't do anything legally, but they sure liked sending their letters anyway.

They are so serious and worrying that you need to stay off school and have toys and treats and six (!) kinds of sweets, and rest. Bad dreams are a huge worry and when they happen you need a ton of comfort and extra care. \n\nThat's a terrible message. Bad dreams can be really horrible - I had a couple of real doozies as a very small child that I remember to this day. But the message has to be, \"I understand.

You\u2019ve absolutely taught her that any fear or anxiety expressed will result in over the top indulgence.  This was a ridiculous response to a nightmare.

You could buy her all the ponies in the world and it won\u2019t fix that feeling from that nightmare. Won\u2019t make it go away. You meant well, but you\u2019re teaching her stuff will make you feel better - and at best that\u2019s a temporary emotional high. \n\nWhat you need to teach her is how to work through those feelings. You may have been able to take her into school late after helping her process the dream and how to healthfully deal with any worries about people being dead while she\u2019s away from you all. But that\u2019s all you should have done.  Maybe a little candy bar after school and telling her you\u2019re proud of her facing her fears. \n\nYou\u2019re doing a disservice to her and yourself. Clearly you have some feelings about your relationship with your older sister - and so in an effort to buy your little sisters love, you are hurting your work and personal relationships. It may be worth discussing both your relationship issues with a therapist and taking some classes on child care.  I also want to note I didn\u2019t develop a close relationship with one of my siblings until we were in our 20s.

This was for you to feel like a cool big sister that she can do whatever she wants with. \n\nYour parents are obviously uncomfortable with your decision.

Also , unless OP can imitate her mom\u2019s voice, guaranteed that a US school would call the mom to confirm. OP what did you really do?

Also dropping all your plans and responsibilities for the day with such short notice for something that wasn\u2019t a legitimate emergency isn\u2019t fair to the people who had expectations from you.

I don't understand any of the rest of it. And then you left her with neighbors to go get a cake? She wanted to feel safe and close to YOU.

I realized that after getting sick for real, I'd be allowed to stay home or something. Then I started pretending to be sick and I got away with it with my dad, but my mom instantly knew it was bs (I was 5 to 8 at that time) and after that I never tried it again. I knew it wouldn't work on mom. \n\nYour little sister will likely pretend to be sick or have nightmares or do something bad or try to feel bad when your mom isn't around, but you are.

I too got to skip school because I hadn't felt well in the night and got a sugary breakfast and tons of treats. Small amounts of each but overall still a ridiculous amount of sugar. And got a doll and time with my grandparents that day doing fun things. Again though it was special because it only happened once. So if you never do another day at this level for her then ok, you overdid it once and made some memories.

She IS the parent, and she doesnt seem a bad parent, so yes, YTA. \n\nIf you had only kept her home, or went to the local park, it's not too bad. But you spoiled her rotten. Which sounds like a wonderful idea at first. But I truly hope Rose *can* understand it is a one time event, then she will have a forever memory of this day. But if she can't, she'll have to learn the hard way. Your mom will be the one who will need to teach her, and who may get resented by Rose for *not spoiling* her.\n\nSo yes, I can understand you wanted this fairytale day. But you need to apologise to mom for going against her way, for likely making parenting Rose more difficult for her, and for likely making things difficult for Rose. Also (mom tip) jusy admit you did it partly for yourself. She may understand that better than how you did this all just for Rose. \n\n(Oh, and please don't blame your 19F sister for not being the kind of big sister you wanted. You are very close in age, even if she's always been called your 'big sister'. Realise that when you were 5 as Rose is now, she was 6. She could not do what you can.

And I also get skipping school every once in a while, there's been a few times my mom surprised me with a theme park trip on a school day, but you have to do things like this in moderation, and you have to do it as a village. Going behind your mother's back and going this hard makes a soft YTA.\n\nNext time she has a dream like this, take her to McDonald's before school and eat together. That alone would make her feel better after a dream like that. Save stuff like theme parks for full family fun, not \"let's lie to mom\"\n\nAs a note, you've done the opposite of teaching emotional literacy. The CORRECT response to fearing losing a loved one is finding and snuggling that loved one. Hugging your dad, or at her age, crawling into Mom's bed.

Your parents are responsible here because they made this possible. 2) she's 5. She's in kindergarten. She's not going to suffer from missing a day of school, and the sweets won't kill her. However, I will say that buying things for her isn't going to build the close sibling relationship you want. Going to the theme park and everything will certainly be a core memory, but kids really just want to know you care. Watch movies/shows with her, ask her about her day and tell her about yours, take an interest in her interests, and play with her. That's all you need to have that strong sibling bond. Tell your parents that you are still young and they need to parent their own kids. It should be on them to get her up and to school in the morning, and there's no reason why you should have been in the position to even make the decision to take her out of school in the first place.

But too much doting will make her too shielded and she won't be able to face the realities of life.\n\nYou did the wrong thing, but it was a one off, and I doubt it did too much damage.

Now, she\u2019s in her late 30s, and still can\u2019t do things on her own because she got used to me helping her, doing things for her.

You taught your sister that she should cry wolf and she will pampered like a queen. Not o.k. at all.", "Ugh. I\u2019m conflicted on this one. I definitely think you made a bad choice in this case but I think a lot of people are making the chosen events of the day into a WAY bigger deal than they are. \n\nIf this was a one off thing, your sister will be fine. She won\u2019t be spoiled by one event - even a big huge event. She may even look back on it for the rest of her life and be so happy and grateful for that day. \n\nMy family struggled financially when I was growing up. We lived in a neighborhood with people who were also struggling. However, my best friend lived across the street so I have a lot of fond memories of my childhood. Each year, my mom and my best friend\u2019s mom would spend all year saving and saving for tickets for all of us to go to a theme park that was a few hours away. We never knew when we were going but it always happened the same way. We would get woken up at 5am, told to get dressed quickly because we weren\u2019t going to school that day - we were going to great adventure. It was always on a school day because weekdays during the off seasons were cheaper back then (not sure if they still are now). This surprise was always amazing and I\u2019ll always look back on those days with pure joy. We would go on rides, eat junk food all day, and have a blast. We\u2019re still best friends to this day - both in our 30s now - and we still talk about those days occasionally. We were definitely not spoiled children. One day of eating crap didn\u2019t kill us (we\u2019re both active, healthy people). \n\nI\u2019m an elementary school teacher now. This one special day a year is something I wouldn\u2019t be upset about my students missing a day of school for. I can catch them up. A lifetime of fond memories can be packed into one day. Sometimes, as long as it\u2019s not a regular thing, family bonding time on a school day can be just as important as school itself. \n\nHOWEVER, I can\u2019t condone what you did here. For one, you are not this child\u2019s parent. If your mom would have sent her to school (and you clearly knew she would have because you said it in your response) then you should have done the same. If you REALLY wanted to give your sister a special day then you could have told her that after you got the okay from your mom, you would both go a do something really fun - a big surprise just for your sister. \n\nYour mom has every right to be upset with you. You took her very young child out to an amusement park on a school day without conferring with your parents first. And if you are constantly buying things for your sister and taking her places where she always get a toy then you may very well be spoiling her. 5 year olds are VERY perceptive when it comes to how different adults in their lives respond to them. They know who to go to when they want to get their way. If your mom was there your sister may have responded very differently to her nightmare knowing your mom wouldn\u2019t have turned it into a whole day of fun. Knowing you have a hard time telling her no, she may have milked it a bit for you in the hopes that you\u2019d let her stay home. She will likely try to get this response from you again. \n\nSo unfortunately (and I do hate to say it because you\u2019re young and your heart was obviously in the right place) YTA in this case.", "Well shit can you do all this for me the next time I have a nightmare?", "Honestly it was a bit much but I disagree with the people saying YTA", "I\u2019m actually quite shocked at all of the Y T A votes.  I\u2019d say NAH (except for the parents).  OP is 18!  Yes, 18 is legally an adult, but an 18 year old also really isn\u2019t developmentally ready to be a primary caregiver (which it sounds like she\u2019s being placed in this position quite often) for a young child.\n\nDo I agree that there are better ways to handle this situation?  Of course I do!  However, I\u2019m not blaming the 18 year old sister who apparently has to play the role of mommy because the actual parents are absent, or at the very least not providing guidance. \n\nThis can turn into a learning experience for older sister.  She only becomes the AH if she doubles down and refuses to learn.", "Meh, every kid deserves a day off from school.   I\u2019m sure she understands that she can\u2019t stay home with you every time she has a nightmare.  You are a good big sister!   And a little extra sugar every now and again isn\u2019t going to hurt her.", "Nta but do you spoil her a lot? Maybe talk to your mom about it and see if they are noticing your sister expecting this stuff. It\u2019s nice as a one off but if your mom thinks it\u2019s a problem, you maybe need to check yourself", "This is quite the story. It sounds more like a fantasy that you wish someone would have done for you. I find it hard to believe an 18 year old has money for a theme park, lunch, toys, all those bakery goods, ice cream, plus ordered a cake from a 5 year old\u2019s \u201cfavorite bakery\u201d (do 5 year old\u2019s have a favorite bakery? And can you order a cake and it\u2019s ready in an hour?) I\u2019m not believing this. But it is a cute story for a children\u2019s book.", "I'm honestly going to go NTA.\n\nI do think you went way overboard because of a dream, I do think you didn't teach your sister much of anything about how to handle problems in her life. Nightmares happen, and a child needs to understand and be taught that nightmares aren't real for one, and also how to deal with these really big, difficult emotions that they get because people don't just understand big emotions all on their own.\n\nThe amount of sweets, even if you didn't let her eat every single thing, was way, way, way too much. Even as a one off day, it was beyond too much. Even if she just had a few bites of each, that is beyond a healthy amount of sugar in a day. It also sets a really crazy precedent that eating when you are sad is the way to go. That getting things when you are sad is the way to go. It does the opposite of teaching her anything healthy because it is telling her that if you are sad, that you get things to make you happy. Material things are not happiness, and it is really best for her to learn that happiness is something that comes from within. Which is not what you taught her at all.\n\nThe reason I say NTA is because you are not her parent. Her parents should be teaching her these things, and yes, you could too as the much older sister because you are still an older figure in her life that could be teaching her all these really important lessons. However, it is technically not your job.\n\nI don't think you are helping her in any sense of the word, I do think that your intentions while nice, were poorly executed. I'm all fine for having a mental health day, but this was not the appropriate reaction. All that stuff and materialism doesn't teach that her family will be there for her and love her always, because time and effort and devotion show that, all it shows is that she can get things from her bigger sister just because.\n\nAs a mother to an almost 5 year old, it is not something that a child that age can comprehend, that they just don't get things. You have said you spoil her in the comments, and it will eventually get to a point where she realizes you will just give her things just because. A child does not need sugar, or shiny new things, a child needs structure, someone to teach her right from wrong, someone to guide her through these big emotions.\n\nThe only reason I am giving you a pass is simply because you are being parentified by your parents, and that is also not okay. I don't care that you are 18, they are still pushing you to be a third parent to your sister because they are always busy. Busy to the point where they won't pick up the phone when one of their children are calling. To the point where you have had to work since you were 15, and also take care of your sister. To the point where they let you make these big decisions for her because they can't be bothered to respond. You have been parentified and that is also not okay.", "   Honestly, after reading through all of your responses, this is either completely made up, deeply exaggerated, or your a trust fund baby. In case of the latter, YTA. Spoiling little kids that much is just way too much.

That was about 17 special occasions when I was 5 and you crammed it all into one day, all because you have a crappy older sister.\n\nWhat you did wasn\u2019t helping her.  What you did was teach her to whine and cry and you\u2019ll let her skip school and ply her with treats\u2026because she had a nightmare.  You didn\u2019t have to tell her to get over it, because that\u2019s just cold, but maybe you could have spent 15 minutes talking to her about how you and sis and mom and dad aren\u2019t going anywhere and that it was just a bad dream.  She\u2019s FIVE.  When I was 5, a snuggle with one or both of my parents and some reassurance was what I needed.\n\nYou need to learn some critical thinking skills.  If you had them, you\u2019d know that what you did was far beyond overboard.\n\nYTA", "NTA - Rose will remember this day forever.", "NTA, and yes you probably overdid the candy thing, but everyone acting like that nightmare is just a little thing, who knows how it affected her, She's still developing her emotional responses.\n\nTaking the day off from school is okay as long as she isn't missing much, however, you're going to also have to reinforce positive, and critical thinking about emotions, and stuff, meaning after that great day, you need to show her that she is loved and that when it happens again she needs to remember this day, and you comfort hug her and make sure she gets past it...\n\nIt can't be a regular thing, but once in a while is okay. Just make sure you help with the emotions as well next time, not just spoiling. The tucking and being brave is great, but you can't always over indulge for bad days, sometimes you have to empower them to get through it. \n\nSo just remind her how loved she is, and remember this day the next time, and tell her to be brave.", "For the sake of voting properly, I will say YTA, but I don\u2019t actually think you are one in character. What I mean by that is that you sound like a kind, sweet, loving older sister. The problem is, that is over the top. Definitely was kind to respond sensitively to your sister having a nightmare. However, there was no need to take her out of school, give her more treats than at Christmas and birthdays, but toys\u2026 etc. The typical response to a child with a nightmare is to just hug them, comfort them, let them talk about it, empathize with them that yeah, that sounds really scary. Then remind the child that it wasn\u2019t real, and she is safe. Then send her to school, where she will forget about it as she gets busy doing school things. \n    The things you did with her are supposed to be very special things, and not all at once. Kids get cake on their birthday, and she got way more than that. They maybe get one toy from their parents, and a few more from friends and family. You told her you can\u2019t do that with every nightmare\u2026but she\u2019s going to rationalize that she can with SOME. Or that you will still spoil her at some level, and if you don\u2019t, she will be upset.  \n     It almost sounds like you really just wanted to spend a special day making memories with your little sister, and the nightmare was just a \u201ccause\u201d to allow it. It would have been totally ok to choose a special day, maybe when school is out, or after a nice achievement such as getting good grades, to take her out for a day. Or start s tradition once a year where you two hang out and have a great time. This is easier to understand because there would be boundaries around it. However, as a response to a nightmare, it doesn\u2019t work because she will hope for that again every time.", "NAH. Once kids turn 4/5yo and start pre-k/kindergarten, they\u2019re in school all day for the next 12-13 or even 17 years. They then go into the real world.

If you really want to help her learn to handle these things, I'd have a look at coping skills for kids, you can learn together how to help her work through these big feelings and give her the tools to self soothe as she gets older (I won't rag on you too much about the sugar since you clarified that you only gave her little bits of everything lol)\n\nNext time, I'd suggest keeping her home for the morning, making pancakes and watching her favourite movie, *maybe* a treat or small toy- it keeps the magic of these special things there- and then see if she can handle the afternoon.\n\n(Also for your sake; these special treats add up over time- theme parks get expensive man! Make sure you're putting enough money away for yourself to help you get your feet on the ground when you move out!)", "Umm you're decision it's not going to hurt her and she had a chance to make a great memory with u .\nEnjoy the time u have with her good for  u taking the time \nGood luck", "I\u2019ll be honest with you. With these others freaking out about being spoiled. I think you know how life is with your sister not being very caring, nor your parents being super strict. You went hard in the paint with the gift day, but I get it, you may have never experienced that so you want her to do so and be happy.\n\nGet tired of the psychologists and teachers talking junk. To be honest, the studies to get those degrees are very easy. There are reasons those majors get to party and goof off all the time. \n\nMost kids I\u2019ve noticed that are the worst are the ones who were ignored entirely and had people be so hard on them so they backlash.\n\nI was spoiled. Given what I want from my mom after my parents divorce. Even my brother took me out to places when I was down and bought stuff for me. Etc\n\nYet I\u2019m a civil engineer (along with my older brother) and we help my mom with her house bills. Help my widowed grandmother all the time. \n\nYou never forgot those that are kind and helpful towards you growing up.\n\nGiving sweets at times and gifts are nice and helpful. As I said, you went really hard in the paint. Is all with love, but don\u2019t take all these people that are bashing you seriously. \n\nDon\u2019t feed her too much and don\u2019t call her out without debating with your parents about it, but it\u2019s okay. \n\nYou\u2019re a sweetheart for your love for her.", "All the Y-T-A comments are disgusting.

I\u2019m gonna say NTA because we don\u2019t get those moments back and a 5 year old little sister  won\u2019t  stay 5 years old for very long. You explained it was a one off in an age appropriate way. Sometimes to be spontaneous just for one day isn\u2019t going to hurt long-term.\n\nPerhaps you did buy a lot of sugar laden treats and gave out some as well but it\u2019s no where as bad as those (I think they\u2019re called) smash cakes where a 1 year old and upwards are allowed to destroy and eat a sugar packed cake and I\u2019m shuddering at the impact that does to their vital organs and especially the brain. \n\nYou and little sis made a memory and you both won\u2019t forget that. Huge hugs to you both \ud83c\udf38", "NTA Jesus, she\u2019s five. Missing a single day of kindergarten won\u2019t impact her much in the long run.

Make her feel heard and validated and supported. The intent is better than a lot of actual parents I see. \n\nWas the execution off? Yeah, but honestly, it's the type of \"parenting\" I'd expect from an 18 year old.\n\nI say NAH.\n\nOP's intent was good, but her mom is also correct that she'll get spoiled if things like this keep happening", "It\u2019s a big sisters job to be fun, she\u2019s not the parent honestly the biggest ah here is the actual parents for relying on their kid to parent the youngest", "It sounds like the parents are not around much. It sounds like she just wants her sister to have the best life possible. She\u2019s overcompensating for the lack of parenting. She explain to her sister that it can\u2019t happen every time. It can\u2019t hurt her to have a fun day. She will be fine. Let her spoil her sister and show her that she is loved. It\u2019s obviously her love language.", "Agreed. \n\nA \"cheer up\" breakfast where you tell her she will never be alone and everything will be OK and MAYBE a small treat for after school is all you need. \n\nYou are raising a spoiled child, OP. Doing all this is going to give her a complex when she's older and she won't be able to make rational decisions.", "Yeah. To put it more kindly, I totally understand that, because you didn't feel connected to or cared for, by your older sister, you want to ensure she gets that feeling of being cared for that you never got. However unfortunately, you've gone completely way too far that way.\n\nIt's lovely to feel cared about, but not at the expense of regular fear regulation, and developing healthy resilient coping strategies. Small children change spaces very quickly so even if it took an hour to re-settle her, it would still be wise to follow that by taking her back to her normal routine of school. Unless she was so unwell (mentally) or tired, that school wasn't suitable, in which case cuddles and love and sleep should have been the method. Showering her with treats will ultimately just confuse her, and influence her motivations and behaviours in weird ways.\n\nI'm sorry this is all such a shock, and I absolutely understand your desperate need to care for her. But in this circumstance I think you were overcompensating, meeting the needs you felt you had as a child rather than her real needs, in a way which will end up having unhelpful consequences.\n\nMuch love darling.", "Well OP\u2019s the sister and only 18. While I find it weird an 18 yr old has the money for all the treats and a theme park, it\u2019s still a youngster in the driver\u2019s seat. I think a more honest account of the situation is in order. Lots of loopholes here.", "Agree. As a mom to a four year old girl, if somebody responded in this way to her waking up from a nightmare upset, I would be livid. It\u2019s absolutely fine to occasionally spoil a child, but every day? And all those baked goods and treats and toys and a theme park all in one day? That\u2019s a sensory overload for an adult, never mind a child. Just imagine how overwhelmed she must have felt throughout the day. Children need routine and stability, sending her to school and taking her to the playground afterwards for an hour would have had a more positive effect on her.", "I agree with everything said here. I also worry that this is setting a terrible precedent. If the little sister knows something as common as a bad dream receives over-the-top rewards, there's a good chance she's going to start claiming bad dreams more often. It also isn't allowing her to develop any sort of coping mechanisms. She's not going to be able to handle minor inconveniences in the futures if she can't even go to school after a bad dream.\n\nYour heart was in the right place, OP,  but there's no question that YTA.", "OP is just teaching her to use sugary junk food (and avoidance) as solutions to temporary problems that aren't ACTUALLY going to help. It's setting up a bad relationship with her and food, leading to emotional eating. And an inability to cope with bad feelings by just being showered with THINGS.\n\nSo glad this is the top comment.", "A break or a treat would have been maybe call her absent for the first hour of school to have a nice breakfast and give her time to calm down, or it would have been buying her icecream or cake or a small toy for when she got home, as a way to let her know you were proud of her for still going to school even when she didn't feel like it. Things like that can help a kid, learning that it's okay to take a little time to look after their mental health or that preserving through a bad time can bring rewards.", "Exactly, I have a four year old sister, albeit I'm 5 years older than OP. Children do need reassurance from older siblings, but there's a different between treating someone and giving them everything they wanted. Take her out for breakfast, or for drinks (like fruit juice, not alcohol), or buy her some chocolate or snack of her choice instead of whatever this monstrosity was.", "I agree also, this was way too much for a nightmare. Make her some smiley pancakes or make some extra snuggle time before school; hell, at least take her in a little late than not at all. Everything about this was overkill.", "Why are you  outwardly judging this 18-year-old with such hostility for obviously giving what she never got. Yet you never once mentioned that clearly she's been parentified the last 5 years (She couldn't have given this girl a day of fun unless she was 100% in charge of her life for the entire day) Maybe this ridiculously outlandish day out was something OP needed as well. She didn't say that she was robbing banks to pay for it, nor insinuated that her sister was 400 lbs. If anything this entire thing proves that she's NTA, and her older sister was likely the golden child hence her desire to not be involved or care for anyone else. It's so easy to be judgmental especially when a little kid is involved, forgetting that the 18-year-old was very recently a little kid who was raising a little kid that she didn't even give birth to.", "I was about to comment on this post but I don't think I can top this response. \n\n100% agree with everything you've said here.", "I am on the fence about this particular day, but I 100% agree with you that spoiling a child is NOT a kindness.

But as a therapist whose caseload is roughly 50% children, I can confidently say that OP\u2019s response to their sister having a nightmare was absolutely bonkers and completely overblown. Nightmares are frightening, and yeah, sometimes they leave you shaken up for a little while. But OP acted like it was some catastrophe that required both her and her sister\u2019s day to be completely upended. OP blew off her obligations (including work obligations) to coddle and spoil her sister because *OP* was so uncomfortable with her sister\u2019s big emotions and wanted to make them go away. In doing so, she made the nightmare a Big Problem that needed a massive, overblown celebration of a day to overcompensate. Instead of helping little sis regulate and learn to move forward from a scary nightmare, OP essentially made the entire day about the nightmare. Let\u2019s have a special breakfast because you were scared! Let\u2019s go to the theme park to make up for your nightmare! Let\u2019s have cake and brownies and cookies and ice cream because you were upset this morning!

Good luck with that. Because in her attempt to soothe her sister, OP honestly probably did far more to solidify the ideas that nightmares Big Problems in her sister\u2019s mind. OP taught her sister that being scared from a nightmare should trigger this big fuss and big effort to \u201cerase\u201d the nightmare. And then OP praised her sister for being brave and not avoiding her fears, but OP made sure the child didn\u2019t have to face any kinds of fears. The kid had a nightmare that she lost everyone and was all alone, and instead of helping her regulate and distract her a bit from the nightmare before sending her to school\u2014where she *would* need to spend a few hours away from family, OP facilitated a day of *constant* contact with her sister.", "Wow it's almost like that was okay because it was your *birthday*.\n\nRose had a nightmare.
