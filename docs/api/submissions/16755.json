Is it because this employee knew about what the managers were doing?

I opened up a case with my states DOL and went from talking to people I thought were my friends to dropped the next day.

He didn't care that the tips were stolen out of your walket but when he needs to payback money that he didn't deserve and that in some way you paid him, he want you to apologize?! Did he apologize for happily taking your tips? No! Time to end the contact.", "Soft YTA. \n\nNot because of calling the DOL, but how incentive you were to your friend. Imagine if you just found out a good amount of your money was possibly about to be taken from you, or even worse, the amount becomes debt because you had to pay bills? If that were me, I\u2019d probably be freaking out. It\u2019s not your fault or his fault but you\u2019re the obvious person to be mad at. What is he going to do, write a letter to the owner of the company? And if he goes the lawyer route, does he have money to pay them? Or maybe try and convince someone it\u2019s a sure win.

They would tell him that all of his tips were \"credit card slips\" that went right into his paycheck with tax obviously.

Honestly even if nothing comes up for me in my favor, I hope he gets every cent that was taken from him."]}
