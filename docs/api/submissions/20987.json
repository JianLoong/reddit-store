He had a drug problem (is now sober) and lost his brother figure in 2020. He also experienced a lot of \u2018typical\u2019 toxic behaviour in his foster homes which caused him to act out and turn to drugs. There\u2019s much more that I cannot say, but hatred for him aside, I am truly mortified at what he went through.\n\nThe issue is that he now seems to think that he\u2019s the arbiter of trauma. If it didn\u2019t happen in a way that is believable to him, then you\u2019re a liar. He also always has to one-up you.\n\nLast week was my birthday and my father disowned me. We had been LC for a long time, but he took the time out of his day to text me on my birthday to say I was no longer his daughter. I was distraught. It happened during my party and I sort of shut down. I told my friends what had happened and Marcus says \u2018well, my dad did XYZ on my birthday\u2026.\u2019 And proceeded to trauma dump. I responded \u2018womp womp. Who fucking cares? Get out of my house.\u2019\n\nAfter a few minutes of arguing, he eventually left in tears. The party was ruined at this point and ended shortly after. I woke up to a few texts from Marcus' friends asking me to talk to him because he's 'traumatised' by my reaction. They said I should have handled the situation with more tact. I said I was done with him.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: 1) I didn't invite Marcus. He was brought along by one of my actual friends who didn't ask me about it first. \n\n2) Marcus is more of an acquaintance (thanks to the commenter who helped me find the word). I'm not pretending to be friends with him. He knows I don't like him.

I do that too. *That being said,* I have learned that 99.9% of the time when the trauma is actively occurring in the moment, that's not an appropriate time to try to relate by saying \"I have also gone through this\".", "I'm a little late to the party so I had time to look through your responses. Here's what I understand:\n\n1. Person you don't particularly like shows up uninvited at your birthday party.\n2. You get traumatizing news during said party.\n3. Person trivializes your hurt by trying to one up you and make it about them.\n4. You have an emotional response and argue. Person leaves.\n5. Person is now playing the victim.\n\nI don't believe in this one sided, \"You should have handled the situation with more tact.\" That cast blame solely on one person and absolves the other. Sure, Marcus has seen some crap. But, if your dad decided it would be a fun thing to just disown you the day of your birthday, so have you. Where is the concern for your trauma?\n\nI'm going with NTA. I'm sorry your Dad ruined your birthday.", "NTA - what happened to him is tragic I'm sure. But it was your birthday and you got a horrible text from your dad. You needed validation and not someone one upping you then and there.\n\nDon't hangout with him. Make it clear that you did nothing wrong and you are not apologizing. You are not a trained specialist, he needs to speak to a specialist for his trauma.", "After reading the edits and some of your responses, I\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nYou can go through trauma and choose to do your best to heal from it, confer with licensed professionals, lean on your friends for support, and try to move forward in a healthy way. \n\nOr you can be like Marcus and make your trauma your entire personality, use it to center every conversation back onto yourself, treat it as free license to stomp all over someone else\u2019s emotional boundaries, and get offended when someone tells you they don\u2019t have the mental wherewithal to hear about it at that time. Now, it isn\u2019t necessarily his fault- he may not have had the resources/support to process his experiences in a healthy way. I feel for him and hope he finds happiness. But, that doesn\u2019t make how he\u2019s acting any less exhausting to be around.\n\nIt definitely isn\u2019t fair of his friends to text bomb and chide you for your lack of \u201ctact\u201d, either. You had *just* received a very gut-wrenching message from somebody who is supposed to always be there for and love you. In a moment like that, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect a rational and careful response from someone. Your response was rude, but understandable; it\u2019s very telling that they\u2019re more concerned about your lack of \u201ctact\u201d in protecting Marcus\u2019s feelings than the fresh heartbreak you\u2019re in the midst of experiencing. They sound like unempathetic jerks. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re going through with your dad. It\u2019s okay not to be okay right now, or for a while. Give yourself all the space and time you need. I hope you\u2019re eventually able to find some healing \ud83d\udc95", "NTA. You were reacting during your own trauma which gives you a bit of a leeway from your reaction. Marcus was making it about himself and self-imposed his own traumatization. While you're reacting to your own trauma, tact is out the window. A caring friend will understand that. Furthermore, someone who has learned empathy from their trauma would've been able to support you through yours. Marcus hasn't dealt with or learned from his trauma and instead uses it as a method to manipulate and gain attention. I'm so sorry for the loss of your father, especially on your birthday. That is a very hard thing to have had happen and should never have happened. You may need to find new friends.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems to me you're only putting up with Marcus because one of your friend's is dating him. So the issue really isn't Marcus but your friend. You need to think about how much you value that friendship because as long as you are friends, you will have to put up with Marcus. \nYou can either stop being friends with Marcus' partner or ride it out in the hopes that they eventually break up with him and you won't have to deal with him anymore. If the latter, you will need to be civil to him and ignore most of his antics. I'd also suggest a very strict list of who is invited to your birthday in future.", "NTA. I\u2019ve cut off multiple friends through the years because they always trauma dumped and expected everyone to want to hear about their sad stories 24/7.", "You are NTA. I\u2019m sorry about your father. That\u2019s so sad, and probably has its own trauma.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to hang with Marcus. I am surprised by your language about him: \u201chonestly despise\u201d \u201chatred for him\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s pretty intense. You actually hate and despise another human being? Then you might look at how the night went down, because your negative feelings towards him are at DEFCON 1 from the get go. With your friends (multiple people) telling you that you traumatized him\u2026 I don\u2019t know, but if multiple people have the same take on my behavior in front of them, I might consider listening.\n\nEither way, you\u2019ve certainly let Marcus live rent-free in your head, as indicated by the vitriolic language you use when posting about him.", "These posts that start with , I have a friend I hate, no you don\u2019t!  A friend is someone you like!! So you have a problem with someone you know, not a friend lol", "I would agree with many here, NTA.  It does sound like he has gotten a shit deal in life, but that doesn\u2019t minimize your own personal trauma, especially to have your own father disown you ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.  If anything, it was a good chance for Marcus to be empathetic towards you, but he missed it.\n\nThe one thing I could say to OP is maybe it\u2019s a good chance to turn it around and try to extend an olive branch to him and kind of show him how he *could* have acted by being an empathetic person, but from what you\u2019ve told us, it just sounds like it would fall on deaf ears.", "NTA people need to stop comparing trauma. Just because someone went through something that was worse doesn't make the pain you feel any better. I saw a saying that I think fits 'someone who drowned in 7ft of water is just as dead as someone who drowned in 20ft'", "I feel bad for both of you.", "If you honestly despise him, why was he at your birthday?\n\nI'm sorry for what you're going through with your dad. Without any background, it still sucks. But if you haven't had any previous honest (and gentle) discussion with Marcus about how he derails discussions about trauma and how that impacts you, then you reaction was completely over the top and Y T A.\n\nSome people neurodiverse people simply relate that way, they're not coming from a bad place. You know, instantly going \"oh yeah me too\". I can't know anything about the dude from your limited post, but juding by what your friends told you his reaction was, I kinda feel for him too.\n\n\\*Edited for judgement after clarification. This sounds a lot more like NTA to me now.", "[deleted]", "Nah. \n\nI imagine that Marcus doesn't have the healthiest ideas about interacting. I don't know that either of you is the AH.

He shouldn't play the trauma Olympics.  But, you were very cruel to him in response.  The better, more mature thing, to have done would have been to have a calm conversation with him at an appropriate time about how this makes you uncomfortable.  But honestly, if you hate him so much, just stop hanging out with him.  You're an AH for continuing to pretend to be his friend too.  Your friends were right, you completely lacked tact in this situation.", "ESH\n\nWhy did you invite someone you hate to your party?\n\nIt was wrong of Marcus to dismiss your feelings, but it was wrong of you to do the same back to him. \n\nIn the future, you should just not invite him to events you are hosting, especially when they are at your own house.", "I am starting to see patterns in these posts.\n\nThe \"AH\" is always someone disadvantaged in society-- someone who is fat, gay, autistic, a single mother, traumatized, etc. They often \"burst into tears\" or \"leave in tears.\" And there is always a friend or text group that functions as a mini-AITA that prompts OP to come here!\n\nI have isolated myself in my big beautiful house for the last few years-- is this what has happened to the world while I was gone?

Someone I was acquainted with online (we run in the same circles) would trauma dump regularly in my DMs. At first, I was sympathetic to their situation and tried to listen and offer support, but eventually had to distance myself as they were just talking AT me. I mentioned being uncomfortable several times and finally, firmly but politely asked them to stop DMing me. They did...but a few weeks later dumped paragraphs of text on me letting me know I traumatized them when I cut them off and told me I should have been kinder in my last message to them. After that, I blocked them. This is all to say I get your frustration, and it must have been even worse since you were dealing with just getting disowned. It sucks to be there for people but they are too self-centered and self-pitying to be there for you. \n\nPeople like this who make trauma into their whole personality and make everything about their trauma are extremely exhausting to be around. It's not their fault they have trauma, and it's okay for them to talk about it, BUT they need to recognize that it is not other people's responsibility to deal with their trauma but their own to do something about it eventually or burn through every single relationship they have. Finally, people like this will not change unless they want to (and even if they did it doesn't mean you have to forgive them or accept them in your life again), so honestly I would save myself the headache and refuse to interact with Marcus ever again.

Why he can't bear sympathy going to anybody else is known only to him.\n\nNTA, and I get how your extended friend circle includes people you don't really like because, friends of friends, not wanting to make an issue and split the group, all that. At this point though, you need to either accept the split is there and make clear that this incident, where you were suffering something incredibly hurtful and he had to make it about him, means you can't both be at the same events. Or you need to have a proper conversation with him, explain to him how you felt and how he came across. He clearly isn't good with emotions or people, so good learning opportunity for him.

Think of how you respond to things in your life when you\u2019re sad, angry, or in a high state of anxiety.

Can you honestly say your response would be very different? \n\nAlso, why is it up to OP to protect this guy\u2019s feelings in the midst of her own heartbreak? Why is it *her* job to be mature? Why isn\u2019t it Marcus\u2019s job to be able to recognize when it is and isn\u2019t appropriate to make the conversation about him? Speaking as someone with ADHD who very often empathizes with others through sharing stories of shared/similar experiences, I understand the tendency. But, there\u2019s a time and place. Based on the fact that Marcus has a pattern of playing the Trauma Olympics, it doesn\u2019t seem that his motives were driven by a desire to empathize.

Nothing gives you the right to lash out at people (and this goes for both of them).  Never in my life, after receiving terrible news, have I lashed out at someone (whether they deserve it or not).  If a reaction from OP was necessary, the appropriate one would have been calmly asking to stay focused on their present situation because they need support right now.
