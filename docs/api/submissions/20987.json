He had a drug problem (is now sober) and lost his brother figure in 2020.

We had been LC for a long time, but he took the time out of his day to text me on my birthday to say I was no longer his daughter. I was distraught. It happened during my party and I sort of shut down. I told my friends what had happened and Marcus says \u2018well, my dad did XYZ on my birthday\u2026.\u2019 And proceeded to trauma dump.

I said I was done with him.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: 1) I didn't invite Marcus. He was brought along by one of my actual friends who didn't ask me about it first. \n\n2) Marcus is more of an acquaintance (thanks to the commenter who helped me find the word).

Here's what I understand:\n\n1. Person you don't particularly like shows up uninvited at your birthday party.\n2. You get traumatizing news during said party.\n3. Person trivializes your hurt by trying to one up you and make it about them.\n4. You have an emotional response and argue. Person leaves.\n5. Person is now playing the victim.\n\nI don't believe in this one sided, \"You should have handled the situation with more tact.\" That cast blame solely on one person and absolves the other. Sure, Marcus has seen some crap. But, if your dad decided it would be a fun thing to just disown you the day of your birthday, so have you. Where is the concern for your trauma?\n\nI'm going with NTA. I'm sorry your Dad ruined your birthday.", "NTA - what happened to him is tragic I'm sure. But it was your birthday and you got a horrible text from your dad. You needed validation and not someone one upping you then and there.\n\nDon't hangout with him. Make it clear that you did nothing wrong and you are not apologizing. You are not a trained specialist, he needs to speak to a specialist for his trauma.", "After reading the edits and some of your responses, I\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nYou can go through trauma and choose to do your best to heal from it, confer with licensed professionals, lean on your friends for support, and try to move forward in a healthy way. \n\nOr you can be like Marcus and make your trauma your entire personality, use it to center every conversation back onto yourself, treat it as free license to stomp all over someone else\u2019s emotional boundaries, and get offended when someone tells you they don\u2019t have the mental wherewithal to hear about it at that time. Now, it isn\u2019t necessarily his fault- he may not have had the resources/support to process his experiences in a healthy way. I feel for him and hope he finds happiness. But, that doesn\u2019t make how he\u2019s acting any less exhausting to be around.\n\nIt definitely isn\u2019t fair of his friends to text bomb and chide you for your lack of \u201ctact\u201d, either. You had *just* received a very gut-wrenching message from somebody who is supposed to always be there for and love you. In a moment like that, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect a rational and careful response from someone. Your response was rude, but understandable; it\u2019s very telling that they\u2019re more concerned about your lack of \u201ctact\u201d in protecting Marcus\u2019s feelings than the fresh heartbreak you\u2019re in the midst of experiencing. They sound like unempathetic jerks. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re going through with your dad. It\u2019s okay not to be okay right now, or for a while.

You were reacting during your own trauma which gives you a bit of a leeway from your reaction. Marcus was making it about himself and self-imposed his own traumatization. While you're reacting to your own trauma, tact is out the window. A caring friend will understand that. Furthermore, someone who has learned empathy from their trauma would've been able to support you through yours. Marcus hasn't dealt with or learned from his trauma and instead uses it as a method to manipulate and gain attention. I'm so sorry for the loss of your father, especially on your birthday. That is a very hard thing to have had happen and should never have happened. You may need to find new friends.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems to me you're only putting up with Marcus because one of your friend's is dating him. So the issue really isn't Marcus but your friend. You need to think about how much you value that friendship because as long as you are friends, you will have to put up with Marcus. \nYou can either stop being friends with Marcus' partner or ride it out in the hopes that they eventually break up with him and you won't have to deal with him anymore. If the latter, you will need to be civil to him and ignore most of his antics. I'd also suggest a very strict list of who is invited to your birthday in future.", "NTA.

Then you might look at how the night went down, because your negative feelings towards him are at DEFCON 1 from the get go. With your friends (multiple people) telling you that you traumatized him\u2026 I don\u2019t know, but if multiple people have the same take on my behavior in front of them, I might consider listening.\n\nEither way, you\u2019ve certainly let Marcus live rent-free in your head, as indicated by the vitriolic language you use when posting about him.", "These posts that start with , I have a friend I hate, no you don\u2019t!  A friend is someone you like!! So you have a problem with someone you know, not a friend lol", "I would agree with many here, NTA.  It does sound like he has gotten a shit deal in life, but that doesn\u2019t minimize your own personal trauma, especially to have your own father disown you ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.  If anything, it was a good chance for Marcus to be empathetic towards you, but he missed it.\n\nThe one thing I could say to OP is maybe it\u2019s a good chance to turn it around and try to extend an olive branch to him and kind of show him how he *could* have acted by being an empathetic person, but from what you\u2019ve told us, it just sounds like it would fall on deaf ears.", "NTA people need to stop comparing trauma. Just because someone went through something that was worse doesn't make the pain you feel any better.

Someone I was acquainted with online (we run in the same circles) would trauma dump regularly in my DMs. At first, I felt sympathetic and tried to listen and offer support where I could, but eventually distanced myself as they ramped up the frequency, intensity, length, etc. I mentioned multiple times I was uncomfortable with the dynamic, and eventually had to just rip off the Band-Aid and tell them to please stop DMing me altogether, which they did.... Until I got a long letter from them a few weeks later letting me know that I had traumatized them when I cut them off and I should have been kinder when doing so because I should know, they're going through so much. After that? I had enough and blocked them. This is all to say that I get your frustration, and it must have been even worse since you were distraught over getting disowned and he still trying to make it about him. I'm really sorry that happened to you, and it sucks to be around people who are just so completely self-absorbed and lacking in self-awareness.\n\nPeople like Marcus who make trauma their entire personality and make everything about their trauma are extremely exhausting to be around. It's not their fault they have trauma, and of course they should be able to talk about it, BUT they also need to recognize that at the end of the day, it is their responsibility to do something about it, NOT other people, and we aren't their 24/7 therapists. On our end, we can recognize that it's possible to feel bad for them and think what they went through/are going through is horrific AND know that that doesn't make it our problem or responsibility. \n\nHonestly, I would refuse to interact with Marcus ever again. People like him do not change unless they want to, and it's clear he doesn't even recognize he has a problem. If your friends are fine with him trauma dumping on them constantly, that's on them, but you importantly set a boundary that was right for you, and that's GREAT.", "NTA this isn\u2019t the trauma olympics and he can take the bullshit somewhere (and I\u2019m saying this as someone who went through a lot of traumatic life experiences)", ">INFO what (paraphrased) was said during the argument?\n\nAfter I told him I didn't care, he said 'what the fuck did you say to me?'

I said 'I know, you never shut up about it but now isn't the time. I need you to leave.' and then he left.", "Technically OP said \"a friend of a friend\", but generally I also find this weird in posts.", ">If you honestly despise him, why was he at your birthday?\n\nAnother guest brought him along without asking me. \n\n> But if you haven't had any previous honest (and gentle) discussion with Marcus about how he derails discussions about trauma and how that impacts you\n\nI have.

As in, \"something similar happened to me once\", meaning \"I really feel I get where you're coming from.\"\n\nI'd say what makes Marcus an asshole isn't so much the fact he brings up his own trauma, but that he shows no actual empathy in the process. Why he can't bear sympathy going to anybody else is known only to him.\n\nNTA, and I get how your extended friend circle includes people you don't really like because, friends of friends, not wanting to make an issue and split the group, all that. At this point though, you need to either accept the split is there and make clear that this incident, where you were suffering something incredibly hurtful and he had to make it about him, means you can't both be at the same events. Or you need to have a proper conversation with him, explain to him how you felt and how he came across. He clearly isn't good with emotions or people, so good learning opportunity for him.

Think of how you respond to things in your life when you\u2019re sad, angry, or in a high state of anxiety.

Can you honestly say your response would be very different? \n\nAlso, why is it up to OP to protect this guy\u2019s feelings in the midst of her own heartbreak? Why is it *her* job to be mature? Why isn\u2019t it Marcus\u2019s job to be able to recognize when it is and isn\u2019t appropriate to make the conversation about him? Speaking as someone with ADHD who very often empathizes with others through sharing stories of shared/similar experiences, I understand the tendency. But, there\u2019s a time and place. Based on the fact that Marcus has a pattern of playing the Trauma Olympics, it doesn\u2019t seem that his motives were driven by a desire to empathize.

Nothing gives you the right to lash out at people (and this goes for both of them).  Never in my life, after receiving terrible news, have I lashed out at someone (whether they deserve it or not).  If a reaction from OP was necessary, the appropriate one would have been calmly asking to stay focused on their present situation because they need support right now.

Trauma is trauma, that's that. \n\nTHIS. THANK YOU. \n\nI've not exactly had an easy life growing up, but it's not exactly been terrible either. Saying that, I had shitty experiences in high school that killed my self-esteem and shit for a while. Sure, it wasn't as bad as some people's, I admit, but what I felt and experienced was very real. I went through it. I experienced it. I lived it. And thankfully, I survived it. About a year after finishing high school, sometimes my mind would unfortunately latch onto bad memories that would cause a borderline panic attack. And honestly, those memories weren't super terrible compared to what other people have gone through, but they still affected me in bad ways I didn't need or deserve. They were traumatic for me and no one has the right to try invalidate ANYONE'S feelings of hurt or trauma. Yeah, maybe having a shitty day at school or work isn't as bad as some kid starving in Africa, but it's still something shitty people go through because life can be like that sometimes unfortunately. \n\nAbout two years after finishing school I was in college, and after having an altercation with a classmate who acted exactly like the kids who would bully me in my old school (loud and obnoxious, always disrupting lessons and causing shit with people for no reason other than he felt like he could get away with it) I began having a mini panic attack to the point where in the next lesson, I could barely concentrate. I was an anxious mess, had my self-esteem plummeting thinking I'm too weak and can't handle any stressful situation, having bad memories of similar situations in school constantly flowing through my head. It got to the point where I spoke with my teacher privately and almost broke down because I was feeling so shitty and I had to leave the lesson at that point. \n\nAnd this teacher was a previous army veteran (or something along those lines) who had seen and experienced some real shit in his life. He had briefly shared a bit of his history with the class, and at that moment when he saw me hurting so much, he comforted me and helped me out. Listened to me, and let me do what I had to to make sure I could feel better. He didn't gatekeep and go \"well, sucks you had an altercation with someone you didn't like, but I've seen dead bodies of people before so-\" Nope. None of that. I was hurting, and he was able to empathise and help out. It didn't matter if it was a different pain that what he had felt, I was feeling pain regardless and he wanted to do what he could to remedy that, which was so damn amazing of him and I can never be more grateful to him. \n\nWe all feel and no one should try to invalidate that, as what we feel is very real to us. Empathising can go along way and if someone can't understand, then they just don't need to get in the way. Simple! But at the same time, some people just can't comprehend that, so... \ud83d\udc80", "Bravo.  Well done!  NTA", "Are you so young that you don\u2019t realize this is an inappropriate question?

Maybe it might help to talk to someone who might understand a little of what you're going through- I know I don't know exactly how you feel, but I might be able to understand a little.
