Sometimes I answer honestly, but sometimes I get tired with the same questions, reactions, and pity responses, that I make up some original or fun story as to how it happened. A few days ago I was taking a rest on a park bench when I saw that one of the kids playing nearby (he must have been about 6 or 7 years old) was acting a bit loudly and obnoxiously. At some point he unexpectedly ran up to me and loudly posed the \"What happened to your leg?\" question. I replied with the first thing that popped into my head which was \"I didn't eat my vegetables. You should eat always your vegetables and fruits\". Then I saw the kid get really scared and nervous, and he mumbled a reply \"What do you mean?! If I don't eat them, I could lose my leg also?\" Then, before I could even say anything back, he started to choke up and cry and ran in the direction of his parents, who were looking at me with a \"wtf\" expression on their faces. So, AITA for possibly traumatizing a curious kid for the rest of his life?\n\nEdit/update: Due to so many demands to help your children eat their vegetables, yes, I am considering requests to conduct a zoom call, scare your kids with my metal pirate leg, and coerce them into eating vegetables or performing other good habits.

But that's also coming from an adult me who's now been diagnosed with autism, who's been on anxiety medication for years. \n\nI'm genuinely not trying to say you were a bad guy or judge you for doing this, or to make you feel bad. I guess I'm just offering a perspective from that tiny portion of kids where this could legitimately cause significant mental distress?\n\nKids aren't able to reason and regulate like we are. So while an adult can hear something like this they're able to then think about it and go \"pfft, no chance\" or \"I'll Google to fact check\", and also to regulate their emotional response\n\nBut kids can't do that until they hit a certain age, and not every kid is able to confide or ask in an adult. For example, I was convinced that I was \"weaker\" than everyone else, because I had panic attacks, and ridiculous levels of anxiety, and struggled so much. But I never confided in anyone because it had been that way for as long as I could remember so I drew the conclusion that this was everyone's reality, they all just dealt with it better than I did. And the last thing I wanted to do was draw attention to my weakness because weakness is vulnerability and opening yourself up to hurt from those stronger than you, even if you're only four. \n\nSo if I'd heard this when I was a kid (and I legitimately have had to have years of therapy to work through similar scenarios where I developed phobias because I couldn't properly regulate or process something an adult said to me or in my presence) it could have straight up caused a phobia to develop, or a panic attack, or life-long anxiety and rigid control behaviors related to vegetables.\n\nObviously I'm very aware that I'm not the norm of the population, and again, I truly don't think you did anything wrong, even before you consider that \"eat you veggies or you won't grow big and strong\" or similar is so prevalent across households. But I would urge you to think about what type of throw-aways you use, because some could be more harmful than others.\n\nAnd while it's not your responsibility to make sure every child ever isn't traumatized and I'm not trying to say that it is, I do hope that this fits within that global realm of higher awareness of our actions and their impacts that we've been able to make so much progress with over even just the last 10-20 years\n\nSorry this is so long \ud83d\ude05 And incredibly sorry if it does come across as offensive, I truly truly truly don't mean it to be, but I do accept my fate if I'm down voted to all hell", "I mean technically you could lose a leg from not eating healthy (diabetes).
