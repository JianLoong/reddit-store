Sometimes I answer honestly, but sometimes I get tired with the same questions, reactions, and pity responses, that I make up some original or fun story as to how it happened. A few days ago I was taking a rest on a park bench when I saw that one of the kids playing nearby (he must have been about 6 or 7 years old) was acting a bit loudly and obnoxiously. At some point he unexpectedly ran up to me and loudly posed the \"What happened to your leg?\" question. I replied with the first thing that popped into my head which was \"I didn't eat my vegetables. You should eat always your vegetables and fruits\". Then I saw the kid get really scared and nervous, and he mumbled a reply \"What do you mean?! If I don't eat them, I could lose my leg also?\" Then, before I could even say anything back, he started to choke up and cry and ran in the direction of his parents, who were looking at me with a \"wtf\" expression on their faces.
