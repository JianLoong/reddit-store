It\u2019s 100% reasonable to expect it returned in same condition. Otherwise you would have given it away. You wanted it back. This is why I don\u2019t lend out my camping gear anymore, people don\u2019t take care of things. If you wanted to buy her one, you would have done that before you lent out yours. NTA.

You did help her.", "Of course it should be returned in the same condition. She was clowned.", "NTA \n\nWhen you borrow something, you return in in better condition then you got it whenever possible. Unfortunately I feel most people don't feel even remotely this way. As much as it pains kind people, it's best not to loan anything you actually want to get back. \n\nI'd get a new pack n play and mail copies of the receipt to the friend, the daughter and the ex with a note that they can split the replacement cost. That way you are not without it but you aren't letting them off the hook. The likelihood of getting the money is low but you tried. And warn any other friends away from loaning their belongings to these people.", "How do you return something all dirty and messy as a pack and play. Seriously you wipe it down with a wet cloth but you have to do more and they're sleeping even as they get older you wipe up any problems doesn't make any sense to me.   I agree with your husband if mom is good to you get her a new one but also your mother learned a lesson about letting people borrow things.", "NTA- \n\nIt's not weird to be upset that someone mistreated a borrowed item... However, it's not YOUR item to be upset about. It's apparently your Mom's item that she uses for your baby... \n\nAnd if your mom has the money to buy a new one or you just don't want your baby in the one she has (legit) than yeah someone is going to be buying a new one. That's just the logistics of the situation. Doesn't matter if your mom's friend pays your mom back, or if your moms friend pays you and your husband back... Or if your mom's friend buys a new one and you bring your own with you when baby is with your mom.", "YTA. Why? It's a case of nunya. Nunya  Bidness. YOUR MOM lent HER pack n play to HER friend. How she handles this is up to her. It has nothing to do with you or any of your own items. It was something your mom let you BORROW when you were at HER house. Bring a pack n play of your own to your mom's house, it was nice of her to have one there for you to use but it is not a requirement of grandparenthood. If she wanted to use it as kindling, it's up to her. You do not need to get in here and make demands. It's not your item or your friend or your business.", "Man. Have some compassion. I\u2019d just let it go. Pretty sure the abuse survivor has bigger things to worry about than lending etiquette.", "YTA. I am taken aback by all the NTAs.

If so, it's reasonable to be angry on their behalf, but how it should be handled is entirely their business and not at all yours.

My mom is the type to go overboard in a loving way. So she\u2019s the one who\u2019s upset right now.
