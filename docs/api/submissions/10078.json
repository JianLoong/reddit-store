He does not have a dedicated room in my home but he does use the guest room.\n\nI remarried and started a new family. My son was part of it. He has spent time with us and we have gone on vacations together with him. His brother and sister love him and he is a great role model for them. He also cares deeply for them. \n\nMy son is sixteen now and he is kind of a pain in the ass. I was much worse at his age. He is doing well in school and we are looking forward to him graduating and going to university. My wife and I got him an old, but safe, car for his birthday. It's great because now he can drive over here to see me on our weekends together. \n\nHis mom met a guy a while back and I guess two months ago he moved in with her. He doesn't get along with my son. I checked with my ex because i did not want only one side. My kid is respectful towards her boyfriend. He just doesn't feel the need to obey him. This is causing problems in their house. \n\nA month ago I got home from work to find my wife, my ex, and my kids were waiting for me. My wife had already sort of warned me on my way home. \n\nMy ex said that my son was fighting in her house and she was done. So he had to come live with me. Then she left. My kid had all his stuff in his car. He looked like he was going to cry. I don't know if it was from sadness, rage, or shame. \n\nI came in and we talked. Sorry some of this is private. My wife and I agreed that he could stay in the guest room until we had time to figure out something more permanent. \n\nWe are using this as incentive to finally finish the basement. I used the money for child support to buy stuff for his room. My dad and my new Father in law are helping out while I am at work. They installed a full bathroom with a shower and have put up walls for the bathroom and his new room. \n\nMy ex just figured out that I have not paid child support for two months. She is pissed and is threatening to go to court. I guess she thought that she was just going to scare him or that we would not be okay with him staying here. She says that I am the asshole for thinking that she really wanted him to move out.\n\nI do have court mandated child support. But if she basically kicked him out I kind of need it to support him.

Make sure the court knows that she essentially kicked him out.", "[deleted]", "Well, you owe the child support because there is a current order.  You need to take her back to court to get it dropped.   I don\u2019t think a court is going to tell a 16 year old that he has to go back to his mom\u2019s after she dropped him off at his dad\u2019s.  But do it before you get in big trouble for being behind on your support.   It sucks because you are using the money to support your son.", "Not sure what country you are in, but at 16 a judge will take into account where the kid wants to go.", "NTA but you need to go to court to get the custody order altered.", "NTA - But you need to lawyer up and get your butt to court.", "NTA. Get a lawyer and get an emergency custody order (been there, done that). That way, your ex can't force him to live with her. \n\nYou may have to continue paying her child support until you go to court to handle the official change in order. That is what happened to us. Now, my husband's ex owes us what he paid her when we had child, on top of normal child support because now we have full physical custody.", "This is not an appropriate question for this reddit, as this is a legal question. \n\nChild support is a court order, not a court suggestion. Until the court changes their order you are required to pay that amount. If you don't want to pay because circumstances have changed, which it sounds like they have, you need to file to get back in front of the court to get that changed.\n\nIf both parents are in agreement to have child support in custody changed, you could file and agreed proposed order with the court, and the court would probably Grant it. But it does not sound like your ex is in agreement, therefore it is in dispute. You need to file and get it taken care of quickly or you can be found in contempt of court. Again, until the court changes the order, you are required to pay that child support. \n\nMany states have self-service legal help online, so that you can file the paperwork without needing to hire an attorney.\n\nIf you give what state you're in, I might be able to direct you to the place online for your state to find those papers that you can file on your own", "NTA for the child support and allowing your son to stay (I think that\u2019s great) but how is it that you have an extra room for a \u201cguest room\u201d in your home but your SON doesn\u2019t have his own room\u2026?\n\nSeriously OP, let him have the guest room as his own. Your own child should have their own room in your home.", "NTA - Not really a reddit question, you need a legal opinion. You might just send her a letter stating simply (with no embellishment) that since your son is living with you full-time, you want a change to your parenting plan. Depending on the laws where you are, she might owe you child support. You might keep that in your back pocket if she tries to take you to court.", "If he is living with you then you shouldn't have to pay child support, but I imagine legally you need to get that signed off rather than just not paying. Nta. I don't understand why the guest room isn't his room, yta there.", "NTA. But seriously lawyer up fast and get you and your son in court pronto.

She can\u2019t dump him on you and expect to keep custody! I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t view it as dumping because clearly your son is welcome with you and you\u2019re scrambling to make this situation work. \n\nIf I were you I would be livid that she would so easily kick your son out of his home over some man.\n\nEdit: Yes legally she can expect child support because it\u2019s court ordered and the court did not make any changes.

Which is why the law needs to get involved.", "YTA for not having a room for your son already.

Your kid should have always had a permanent room in your house. Period.

Not the fact that you neglected to give him a permanent room in your home until now, or the fact that you want to re-do your basement. \n\n4. You need to handle issues like this through the proper channels. Not just stop paying child support without telling anyone. If your son is now going to be living with you permanently, you need to discuss the child support with your ex, and if she\u2019s uncooperative, get the courts involved. \n\nYour ex is TA for obvious reasons. Forcing your son to come live with you, especially if she knows that you have not allowed your home to become his home as well, is just beyond shitty.

He may be a PITA, but that's just being a teenager. Continue to be a good dad.
