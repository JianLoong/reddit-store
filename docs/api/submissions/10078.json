I checked with my ex because i did not want only one side. My kid is respectful towards her boyfriend. He just doesn't feel the need to obey him. This is causing problems in their house. \n\nA month ago I got home from work to find my wife, my ex, and my kids were waiting for me. My wife had already sort of warned me on my way home. \n\nMy ex said that my son was fighting in her house and she was done. So he had to come live with me. Then she left.

My wife and I agreed that he could stay in the guest room until we had time to figure out something more permanent. \n\nWe are using this as incentive to finally finish the basement. I used the money for child support to buy stuff for his room. My dad and my new Father in law are helping out while I am at work. They installed a full bathroom with a shower and have put up walls for the bathroom and his new room. \n\nMy ex just figured out that I have not paid child support for two months. She is pissed and is threatening to go to court. I guess she thought that she was just going to scare him or that we would not be okay with him staying here. She says that I am the asshole for thinking that she really wanted him to move out.\n\nI do have court mandated child support. But if she basically kicked him out I kind of need it to support him.

You need to take her back to court to get it dropped.   I don\u2019t think a court is going to tell a 16 year old that he has to go back to his mom\u2019s after she dropped him off at his dad\u2019s.

Now, my husband's ex owes us what he paid her when we had child, on top of normal child support because now we have full physical custody.", "This is not an appropriate question for this reddit, as this is a legal question. \n\nChild support is a court order, not a court suggestion. Until the court changes their order you are required to pay that amount. If you don't want to pay because circumstances have changed, which it sounds like they have, you need to file to get back in front of the court to get that changed.\n\nIf both parents are in agreement to have child support in custody changed, you could file and agreed proposed order with the court, and the court would probably Grant it. But it does not sound like your ex is in agreement, therefore it is in dispute. You need to file and get it taken care of quickly or you can be found in contempt of court. Again, until the court changes the order, you are required to pay that child support. \n\nMany states have self-service legal help online, so that you can file the paperwork without needing to hire an attorney.\n\nIf you give what state you're in, I might be able to direct you to the place online for your state to find those papers that you can file on your own", "NTA for the child support and allowing your son to stay (I think that\u2019s great) but how is it that you have an extra room for a \u201cguest room\u201d in your home but your SON doesn\u2019t have his own room\u2026?\n\nSeriously OP, let him have the guest room as his own.

I am aware that the definition of this can vary, but he did let him have a a private room to himself whenever he stayed; however frequent or infrequent it was.\n\nNow his son is living there, it did not take OP long to start creating a bedroom with en-suite for him. They didn't just go 'Guest room is yours now', they are committing  time, effort and finances specifically to giving him his own personal space.\n\nFrom the sound of it though, despite not having his own room, is sounds like the son was always welcome and accepted with OP and that is  more important than a dedicated personal space.

Until his space in the basement is finish, the guest bedroom is now his official bedroom.\n\nPreviously, he didn\u2019t have a dedicated room because the father had visitation. I took that as the kid wasn\u2019t staying there often so he wasn\u2019t keeping a separate bedroom at their home.

If that is the scenario, which I\u2019m assuming it is, I can understand why the kid didn\u2019t have a dedicated room that was his with his stuff in it. If the kid is staying overnight once a month, might as well use the room as a guest bedroom as well.
