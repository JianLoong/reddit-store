I got visitation and my ex got child support. \n\nI kept a good relationship with my son. We spent time together and I helped him figure out his life. He does not have a dedicated room in my home but he does use the guest room.\n\nI remarried and started a new family. My son was part of it. He has spent time with us and we have gone on vacations together with him. His brother and sister love him and he is a great role model for them. He also cares deeply for them. \n\nMy son is sixteen now and he is kind of a pain in the ass. I was much worse at his age. He is doing well in school and we are looking forward to him graduating and going to university. My wife and I got him an old, but safe, car for his birthday. It's great because now he can drive over here to see me on our weekends together. \n\nHis mom met a guy a while back and I guess two months ago he moved in with her. He doesn't get along with my son. I checked with my ex because i did not want only one side. My kid is respectful towards her boyfriend. He just doesn't feel the need to obey him. This is causing problems in their house. \n\nA month ago I got home from work to find my wife, my ex, and my kids were waiting for me. My wife had already sort of warned me on my way home. \n\nMy ex said that my son was fighting in her house and she was done. So he had to come live with me. Then she left. My kid had all his stuff in his car. He looked like he was going to cry. I don't know if it was from sadness, rage, or shame. \n\nI came in and we talked. Sorry some of this is private. My wife and I agreed that he could stay in the guest room until we had time to figure out something more permanent. \n\nWe are using this as incentive to finally finish the basement. I used the money for child support to buy stuff for his room. My dad and my new Father in law are helping out while I am at work. They installed a full bathroom with a shower and have put up walls for the bathroom and his new room. \n\nMy ex just figured out that I have not paid child support for two months. She is pissed and is threatening to go to court. I guess she thought that she was just going to scare him or that we would not be okay with him staying here. She says that I am the asshole for thinking that she really wanted him to move out.\n\nI do have court mandated child support. But if she basically kicked him out I kind of need it to support him. He says he does not want to live there with her new boyfriend. Legally she could make him.\n\nAITA?\n\n#EDIT\n\nHey sorry I posted then went to work.  \n\nTo answer some questions and allay everyone's concerns.  \n\n1. My divorce kind of screwed me over.  I had an apartment and my son used my bed and I slept on the couch when I had him. After I got married my wife and I worked hard and we got a better apartment together. We had two rooms and one was his.  Then we got pregnant.  Her parents and mine helped us out and we rented a small house.  A bungalow with three rooms. We had a guest room because my sister came to stay with us and help for a while because it was a tough birth.  When he came over he got the couch since he didn't have a permanent room. When my wife went back to work we saved up and got a house with four bedrooms.  Easier time with the second kid. So we do have overnight guests a fair bit.  And my son does not always spend the night. So yes for the six or seven nights a year I got him he didn't have a dedicated room.  \n\n2. My lawyer knew about my son being at my house the day after it happened. My butt is covered.

Until the court changes their order you are required to pay that amount. If you don't want to pay because circumstances have changed, which it sounds like they have, you need to file to get back in front of the court to get that changed.\n\nIf both parents are in agreement to have child support in custody changed, you could file and agreed proposed order with the court, and the court would probably Grant it. But it does not sound like your ex is in agreement, therefore it is in dispute. You need to file and get it taken care of quickly or you can be found in contempt of court. Again, until the court changes the order, you are required to pay that child support. \n\nMany states have self-service legal help online, so that you can file the paperwork without needing to hire an attorney.\n\nIf you give what state you're in, I might be able to direct you to the place online for your state to find those papers that you can file on your own", "NTA for the child support and allowing your son to stay (I think that\u2019s great) but how is it that you have an extra room for a \u201cguest room\u201d in your home but your SON doesn\u2019t have his own room\u2026?\n\nSeriously OP, let him have the guest room as his own.

You need to handle issues like this through the proper channels. Not just stop paying child support without telling anyone.

If that is the scenario, which I\u2019m assuming it is, I can understand why the kid didn\u2019t have a dedicated room that was his with his stuff in it. If the kid is staying overnight once a month, might as well use the room as a guest bedroom as well.

Regardless, legally you still need to be paying the child support. They can and will take your personal and professional licenses away. They can and will intercept your tax return. They can and might throw you in jail and make you pay a stipend to get out. This is last steps but it CAN get there. You need to get the legalities figured out. As much as it sucks the first step would be to catch up on your child support...or at least have an amount equal to the child support obligation set aside for when the judge makes you pay it.
