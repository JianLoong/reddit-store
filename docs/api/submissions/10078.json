He has spent time with us and we have gone on vacations together with him. His brother and sister love him and he is a great role model for them. He also cares deeply for them. \n\nMy son is sixteen now and he is kind of a pain in the ass. I was much worse at his age. He is doing well in school and we are looking forward to him graduating and going to university. My wife and I got him an old, but safe, car for his birthday. It's great because now he can drive over here to see me on our weekends together. \n\nHis mom met a guy a while back and I guess two months ago he moved in with her. He doesn't get along with my son. I checked with my ex because i did not want only one side. My kid is respectful towards her boyfriend. He just doesn't feel the need to obey him. This is causing problems in their house. \n\nA month ago I got home from work to find my wife, my ex, and my kids were waiting for me. My wife had already sort of warned me on my way home. \n\nMy ex said that my son was fighting in her house and she was done. So he had to come live with me. Then she left.

My wife and I agreed that he could stay in the guest room until we had time to figure out something more permanent. \n\nWe are using this as incentive to finally finish the basement. I used the money for child support to buy stuff for his room. My dad and my new Father in law are helping out while I am at work. They installed a full bathroom with a shower and have put up walls for the bathroom and his new room. \n\nMy ex just figured out that I have not paid child support for two months. She is pissed and is threatening to go to court. I guess she thought that she was just going to scare him or that we would not be okay with him staying here. She says that I am the asshole for thinking that she really wanted him to move out.\n\nI do have court mandated child support. But if she basically kicked him out I kind of need it to support him.

You need to take her back to court to get it dropped.   I don\u2019t think a court is going to tell a 16 year old that he has to go back to his mom\u2019s after she dropped him off at his dad\u2019s.

Now, my husband's ex owes us what he paid her when we had child, on top of normal child support because now we have full physical custody.", "This is not an appropriate question for this reddit, as this is a legal question. \n\nChild support is a court order, not a court suggestion. Until the court changes their order you are required to pay that amount. If you don't want to pay because circumstances have changed, which it sounds like they have, you need to file to get back in front of the court to get that changed.\n\nIf both parents are in agreement to have child support in custody changed, you could file and agreed proposed order with the court, and the court would probably Grant it. But it does not sound like your ex is in agreement, therefore it is in dispute. You need to file and get it taken care of quickly or you can be found in contempt of court. Again, until the court changes the order, you are required to pay that child support. \n\nMany states have self-service legal help online, so that you can file the paperwork without needing to hire an attorney.\n\nIf you give what state you're in, I might be able to direct you to the place online for your state to find those papers that you can file on your own", "NTA for the child support and allowing your son to stay (I think that\u2019s great) but how is it that you have an extra room for a \u201cguest room\u201d in your home but your SON doesn\u2019t have his own room\u2026?\n\nSeriously OP, let him have the guest room as his own.

I am aware that the definition of this can vary, but he did let him have a a private room to himself whenever he stayed; however frequent or infrequent it was.\n\nNow his son is living there, it did not take OP long to start creating a bedroom with en-suite for him. They didn't just go 'Guest room is yours now', they are committing  time, effort and finances specifically to giving him his own personal space.\n\nFrom the sound of it though, despite not having his own room, is sounds like the son was always welcome and accepted with OP and that is  more important than a dedicated personal space.

Until his space in the basement is finish, the guest bedroom is now his official bedroom.\n\nPreviously, he didn\u2019t have a dedicated room because the father had visitation. I took that as the kid wasn\u2019t staying there often so he wasn\u2019t keeping a separate bedroom at their home.

If that is the scenario, which I\u2019m assuming it is, I can understand why the kid didn\u2019t have a dedicated room that was his with his stuff in it. If the kid is staying overnight once a month, might as well use the room as a guest bedroom as well.

He lived with them thereafter. )", "The ex can take him to court yes and then the court will discover that she too is in violation by no longer having the kid live with her. The child support is literally because the kid lived with her most of the time, which he no longer does. Not only that, she kicked out a minor which is illegal in and of itself, at least in the US.\n\nYes OP should be proactive here imo, if for no other reason than to get this resolved quickly for the sake of his son. But boy do I wish the ex would take this to court, I'm sure the judge could do with a laugh.", "Good point but first paragraph. OP only has visitation. Guest room makes perfect\nsense if you don\u2019t have partial custody.", "Did you read the post? OP only had visitations not 50%, and that could mean that he had his son one or two times a month(and not even full days) so no he didn't have the son all the time, but now that he has him 100% OP immediatly spung to action to make a room for his son.", "Visitation is typically on a regular schedule, every kid I know that had divorced parents had their own room at both houses, regardless of the split. OP is straight up cruel to his son by making him sleep in a guest room while his new kids have their own rooms.", "But person above me mentioned 50% so i corrected them, that regardless if that was true, which it's not, a child deserves their own space, even if it's a corner in their sibling's room.", "Not even 50 percent of the time, he only had weekend visitations.", "Maybe he didn't because:\n1. He was paying child support.\n2. His son wasn't there 100% of the time and there was already an available guest room.\n\nAt least think a little before throwing blame :)", "Even when you pay child support, you have to pay for stuff for your child. Child doesn't stop needing things when they leave their mom's home to go to dad's place. Nor does she pay for child's needs when it's dad's time. \n\nChild support is given to *even out* the costs between main caretaker and the other parent. It does not mean that mother has to pay for everything and dad, after he pays CS, doesn't use his money at all to care for his child.\n\nAnd OP didn't need to build Versailles. He already has a fully functional room, he saves for some hypothetical guests. All it takes is allowing little dude to paint the walls, store his toys and stick his posters to the wall. It costs almost literally nothing."]}
