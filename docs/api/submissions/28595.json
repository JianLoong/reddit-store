There are all kinds of sounds that happen on a massage table, and moaning is one of them. However, depending on the type of moan, and if it's followed with a \"that's a sore spot\", or something to qualify why the moan happened, moaning can be considered really creepy. Because MTs get hit on all the time, due to the misconceptions that some people have of therapeutic massage, we can get really antsy when it comes to certain comments, sounds etc that happen in the clinic room.\n\nWithout knowing any other context, I'd say N T A, but it is also completely within the MTs rights to end a massage at any point that they feel uncomfortable and/or threatened by the client. There are too many instances of MTs who have been sexually assaulted for us to not be hypervigilant about things.\n\nEdit to add - somehow, in my sleep addled brain, I missed the \"let a few more out to just fully relax\" part of that.

I wanna say NTA because the first bit was involuntary. But as a former massage therapist that had this happen? It's creepy on our end and doesn't happen nearly as much as people think in professional settings. Sleeping? Yup. Snoring? Yup. Moaning outright? Not so much. I expect that just as you would like to be comfortable during a massage, your therapist also need to be comfortable working on you. Your moaning clearly made her uncomfortable, and as much as it might be an involuntary response in some ways, it just adds to the stereotype of massages being sexual.

Yes, massage therapists should be used to involuntary noises but in my opinion continuing to make moaning noises is kind of weird, and now you know. \n\nIf you've never had a massage before and don't know the etiquette  then like, fine - but I think  YTA for arguing with the receptionist - You are not entitled to your money back - it isn't as if the therapist could get her time back from you, or could fill the remainder of your time with another client. \n\nChalk it up to a lesson learned.", "YTA- that is a very uncomfortable situation for the masseuse.

Personally, I see moaning as related to feeling good, even outside of  sexual context. If the masseuse had dropped a hint or let OP know that she found it extremely uncomfortable, and he still did it anyway, I'd 10000% say YTA.  \nNot to mention there's a tonne of different ways and tones to moan in, some of which are clearly sexually suggestive, others not. Impossible to say what OP did, but I believe to give the benefit of the doubt to them.", "he\u2019s only replying to people agreeing with him too. idk why he chose to even post on the sub. so creepy.", "I'm not convinced his behavior was inappropriate; I'd have to hear the \"moans\"!", "Based on the fact that you make a beeline to kiss up to the minority that thinks your behavior was ok (it wasn't, it was really creepy) you don't actually care about wondering if you're an asshole and need to change your behavior. You just wanted validation and will take whatever crumbs you get as a victory\n\nYTA", "I mean, they violated the contract, not you. Arguably, you could have asked for all your money back since they did not fulfill their end. A more reasonable stance would be just to ask for the money for the remaining time.\n\nLook at like this, you pay someone to perform at a kids birthday party for an hour. They decide to leave cuz your kid is annoying, 30 mins in. Do you owe them for the whole hour? No way in hell", "Im a girl", "So you're gonna target this business because of _your_ weird behaviour? Come on, girl.", "No girl talks like this, man. \nWould you have been moaning being touched by another man?\nYTA if anything you should call and apologize profusely. Registered massage therapists are professionals and you tried to undermine that.", "Misread that to be a \"didn't fight not to\" I suppose.", "Did you even read the post?", "Hmm don\u2019t think I agree with this, they have every right to not continue the massage but equally they can\u2019t charge for a service not given, if op stopped the massage then yes they have to pay the full time, the masseuse cancels the time they can\u2019t then charge still, I open a shop, don\u2019t even need to be good, just tell everyone I feel uncomfortable as soon as they walk in the room, yea still pay for that hour on the way out, next\u2026\u2026.. I would not have paid for something I didn\u2019t receive.\n\n\nEdit : not to say it\u2019s a normal thing to start loud moaning though lol", "I love how everyone getting mad about this is a teenage girl or a mentally ill feminist lmfao", "what other slang are y'all weirdly whiny about", "I wish I could pay for a $30 hour addon to just nap after the massage, hahah", "Thank you! It was a magical massage at a time when I was incredibly stressed. I'm going to make another appointment, thanks!!", "S/he was moaning *deliberately*. What purpose do you think that is supposed to serve?", "I absolutely guarantee it was inappropriate. Masseuses deal with casual moaning on a daily basis. For them to have stopped the service 3/4 of the way in they had to have felt EXTREMELY uncomfortable.", "Ok, that doesn\u2019t change anything though.", "How's that .. different?", "OP started some portion of the timeslot (and never specified how much of their time was cut off, be it 50% or less). So OP did receive services. The issue becomes that they are not going to change for any less than a full increment of time. Its like billing by the hour: as soon as you start into an hour, you are billed for the full hour. And again, they can't sell the rest of that timeslot, as the whole timeslot was being sold to OP. They can't sell half a massage.\n\nPlus, OP's actions caused the service to be cut short. I do not view that as being any different than OP asking to end early; an action taken by OP, be it asking for the session to be over or by acting inappropriately, marked the end of the session. OP ended the session, so the burden is on them to pay for the whole timeslot.", "Companies build their business on repeat business and word of month. Your fake company would be hemorrhaging money", "Every troll is a pathetic loser. Find a less embarrassing hobby.", "It's not slang, it's normalized baby talk. The amount of downvotes shows just how young most of Reddit really is. Children.", "Right? Wrap me up like a burrito and roll me into the corner!", "I have made the suggestion for a nap upgrade! Good to see that would be a viable option for y\u2019all!", "Please do! Tell you therapist your goal is relaxation and you want to just tune out and you should be blissfully relaxed \ud83d\ude34", "Where in my comment did I say it did", "Where in my comment did I say it did", "Do they list on the wall to not moan? Yea it made the masseuse uncomfortable so they should be able to end it when they want but if he didn\u2019t breach any conditions, they\u2019ve revoked the service due to personal reasons, you shouldn\u2019t pay for a service you didn\u2019t receive, they paid for an hour they didn\u2019t get, it becomes like this to me, either they were so weirded out they don\u2019t care about trying to charge the time they didn\u2019t provide or they want the money that much put earbuds in and zone out to his moaning, there is no middle ground, you\u2019re either happy to ditch the customer and not get paid or the pay is enough to put up with the customer.", "Taking money for no service doesn\u2019t sound like haemorrhaging money, it sounds like a lot of what we deal with in life lol, maybe that\u2019s where people go wrong.", "It's literally slang lmao. You remind me of when Boomers would whine about \"bad means good???\" in the 90s.", "I\u2019ve decided the word \u201cnormalized\u201d is childish apropos of nothing. Hey look, guess you\u2019re a child now \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Common sense. I'm sure they don't have \"don't pee on the table\" on the wall either.", "Common sense is don\u2019t eat yellow snow, not making noises during a massage is common courtesy but if you\u2019re goi g to deny service due to it, it should be said", "Moaning excessively most certainly counts as sexual harassment, which falls under the legal territory, and \"don't sexually harass the staff\" is 1000% common sense."]}
