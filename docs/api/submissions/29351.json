As a child of an alcoholic I want you to know I see you, I hear you and your feelings are valid. If you do have any unfinished business though, I suggest getting it off your chest while he's still here. I'm not saying you'd have to speak or see him, but if you've got the time write it all out. Whether you send it to him is your choice but it'll be good to get it out of your system. I wish you peace.", "Oof. It feels like I could've written this post. NTA: you deserve to take whatever measures you need for your own well-being. You don't owe him anything, it's wretched that he's using a diagnosis to hold over your head as if you do. It's unfair and unreasonable of him to make demands of you, bringing up all that past pain that you've worked so hard to process and get beyond and heal yourself from. If you did see him, you'd be left on  your own to manage the fallout, yet again.", "Sounds rational, but this is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade.", "Some day you may go to Al-Anon and heal from your hatred and resentment.

But this is something you have to decide. If you feel it is wrong not to see him, then invite him to lunch or better yet, brunch. Allow him to say his peace and then say yours.
