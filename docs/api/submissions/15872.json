And recently his step brother (19M) got a girl pregnant and asked her to marry him. So, context I have been in the family for 3 years, longer if you include the 5 years of on again off again relationship between me and my husband. This girl (20F) newly met my brother in law in the past two years. She has a kid by someone else and thinks for some reason she can call me and complain constantly. About her ex, my brother in law, my other in laws, her family,etc. Then when I give her advice she makes me feel like an asshole. \n\nExample- she called me two weeks ago complaining if the way my father in law treats her. Claiming he treats me better and my husband better than he treats her and brother in law.\n\nSo I told her I'm sorry she feels that way I do not think he intentionally wants to make her feel that way.  Well she insisted it's on purpose and I honestly wanted the conversation to end, so I simply said maybe he feels closer to me since my husband and him are closer than he is with brother in law and we spend so much more time over with them. Also, I explained it took a bit for him to speak to me regularly and for me to feel welcome so she just needed to wait it out. \n\nWell she took this comment as me saying he does not like my brother in law since he is the step son and she ran with that causing a huge family blow out. Now everyone is mad at me. That is not how I meant the comment. I simply meant my husband is closer to his dad than his step brother is to his dad. She twists my words constantly and I finally have had enough. \n\nSo i sent her the following message, \"I am not your friend, or therapist. I am your future sister in law. I'm sorry you feel as if you are not welcomed in the family and I am sorry you have so many issues with your own life. But due to recent events I will no longer lend you an ear and suggest if you need someone to talk to you speak directly to the people bothering you.\" \n\nLastly, I never gave her my number or anything else she got it from a family group chat and just started calling. So, I never told her to call me if she needs someone. \n\nSince, I sent the message none of my in laws are speaking to me or my husband because she blew up telling people I called her crazy. So, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1682629517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1316wm6/aita_for_telling_my_future_sister_in_law_i_do_not/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think the rest of the family will catch on quick enough that chick is crazy, at least I hope so for your sake.", "NTA and I\u2019m so grateful you made a boundary with this high maintenance and quite possibly mentally ill young woman. Please explain- or have your husband do so- that you have chosen to go LC with FSIL because it\u2019s your experience that she hears what she wants to hear and not what you said, give examples and let it go while sticking to your very concise boundaries. And be prepared to wait it out- fact is she is pretty clearly a bridge burner- she\u2019ll burn it all down on her own.", "NTA. I expect they\u2019ll all get similar treatment soon enough and realize who the problem person was in this case.", "NTA \n\nIf I were you I might be tempted to correct the lies she is telling. \n\nIt should blow over soon enough on its own as she will likely lie about all of them as she works her way through them one by one.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame you for letting them all know how disappointed you are that even though they have known you for years, it was ridiculously easy for them all to assume the worst of you instead of going to you and asking what happened. It would take me a long time to trust people again who I thought loved me but were willing to discard me without asking any questions.", "NTA. Sounds like you calmly and reasonable set boundaries with her after it was clear things were going south.

Good luck to BIL, I think he'll have his hands full.", "I would count radio silence from in-laws as a win! NTA", "I may get down voted for this bug here goes. People react differently to someone who\u2019s marrying into the family vs. someone who winds up pregnant. While we shouldn\u2019t judge, the circumstances make a difference. Your in-laws had time to get to know you and even if they weren\u2019t too fond of you, they knew their son loved and respected you. For some families, that\u2019s enough. But if you don\u2019t knew the SO or you do but are not fond of them, and now they are pregnant, it\u2019s kind of like it\u2019s all forced on them to include this new person. Idk, that\u2019s just how things can play out sometimes. Again, not judging.", "NTA. She's a drama queen.  You are a mature adult.", "NTA. You gave her the benefit of the doubt for much longer than most people would have. Now that she\u2019s caused issues with you and can\u2019t vent to you anymore, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll pick another person in the family to do so and it\u2019ll blow up in her face. Go low contact until she shows the rest of them her true colors and I bet you\u2019ll be in good graces again.", "NTA drop the rope with DH\u2019s family, they will see her true colors soon enough. This girl sounds incredibly immature and feeds off drama, don\u2019t engage.", "NTA. You said what needed to be said. I would have been much ruder. And this...*Like she goes out of the way to avoid his family.* So, why was she bitching about his family not accepting her if she didn't want to be a member of his family? Let things be for now. The rest of the family will figure out what a drama queen she really is. She won't be able to help herself, lol :)", "NTA.

Which she ended up doing. Do they all really believe you\u2019re the bad guy?", "NTA\n\nThe only thing you have control over is your own behavior. Keep being you and the people who actually matter will figure out what you\u2019re really about (and figure out what she is really about) and it will sort itself out. \n\nI would also make sure to never be alone with her in any family setting and ignore any future calls and messages. If anyone asks why, tell them you don\u2019t talk to anyone who twists words and leave it at that (don\u2019t bother with examples).\n\nEdit: typo", "Share with the family your side. Tell them she bitches to you about them frequently (but don\u2019t tell them what she actually says). Say that you would prefer that she stop but that this led to a big drama. Future sil is sharing misinformation and twisting your words and outright lying. You do not want to be involved in that kind of behaviour. \n\nThen back off. Future sil will dig her own grave.\n\nTake the high road, don\u2019t meet her gossiping or bitching with your own. And then take the road right out of there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are right to stop engaging with her. I\u2019d set the record straight though. Make sure everyone else knows she is always contacting you complaining about them and not liking that you don\u2019t agree with her and that you never said that.", "Exactly! NTA", "I really think her main issue is she is so young and she is looking for a guy to parent her toddler and that she can control.

The guys really don't care like father in law and his brother are just over the drama. But the women in the family keep wanting to drag it out.", "Right and I completely understand that. And that's why for the longest time I kept listening to her, but the issue really started when she was taking words and putting them in my mouth. I also think she makes it even harder for them because her main concern is bringing him into her family not joining their family if that makes sense.

She's been smearing the OP ever since.   She needs to be shut down hard.", "Sounds like they like drama and ur better off without all that. Ask yourself, is all this bs/drama/stress worth it so u can maintain a relationship with any of them?", "I\u2019m just gona throw this out there, she was complaining about not being close enough to the family, asked for your opinion, twisted what you said and spread that around the family and now they are all rallying around her and have dropped you. If I was in your shoes I would pass along the message of \u201cthis person is actively trying to manipulate people to get what she wants and is willing to say whatever she needs to say to get it. I\u2019m sad that this is where we are at right now but I am choosing to remove this toxic person from my life but would still love to have you in it. I will give you space to consider things and would like to talk about this further when you are ready.\u201d", "I didnt say it wasn't true. But pointing that out right then was nothing but unhelpful. \n\nThe woman texting and calling OP like this with no invitation has clearly got boundary issues, already delusional. OP saying that there just exploded the bomb earlier.", "If you\u2019re saying something reasonable and someone misinterprets it it\u2019s not your responsibility.", "op=NTA\n\nShe's a drama llama.  Plus she probably figures if she alienates the family from YOU, she'll become the preferred daughter-in-law.\n\nGet on same page with Hubby, and wait it out--cause the relationship(based on her past history) probably won't last long."]}
