The dog is too sensitive and can't be around the baby. The baby cries a lot (had a colic the first months) and still she is a baby and cries from time to time.

I say to him that that's true but it's too much to me right now, the dog is making my life miserable.\n\nHe (my husband) is devastated and says that I'm the worst human being because I want to get rid of the dog.

Now the dog is three and has no idea who is the leader in the house + attachment issues. \n\nIf your family cannot commit to the training requirements, another family would be a happier place for the dog.

Get a lovely temporary rental, if you prefer. You deserve a safe space for yourself and your infant. Your hubby needs to show THAT HE'S NOT AN EVIL DOG OWNER, BY IMMEDIATELY GETTING HIMSELF ENROLLED IN BEHAVIORAL TRAINING, so that he can effectively lead your poor, anxiety ridden greyhound to emotional, physical, and behavioral health. \n\nHe needs to become consistent with exercising such a phenomenal athlete of a dog (not leave him to run you ragged), every day, both mentally and physically. He needs to cook healthy foods for them both, to improve doggo's mental and emotional health - and work on recipes for your and baby's return. There are a plethora of emotionally intuitive and brilliant new techniques in dog training, which empower the dog to make use of their innate nature and talents to best advantage. \"Winnie the Cattle Dog's\" owner on TikTok discusses many of them. Ultimately, he needs to create a list of goals - and work to check them off the list, whilst NEVER pressurizing doggo, and ALWAYS pressurizing himself. Obviously, sleeping alone, massively reducing attachment, making doggo safe and calm around infants and children, and reducing anxiety are at the top of the list. \n\nIn the meantime, YOU FOCUS ON YOUR CHILD and YOURSELF!!\u2764\ufe0f", "We did for a while.

They are by no means perfect because I didn't dedicate hours to training them every day, but I _did_ do enough to make sure they were well adjusted, potty trained, and they know basic commands. Every dog is different, but no dog _needs_ to sleep in your bed. \n\nWithout you giving details on how you tried to train him, it sounds like you didn't try at all and therefore this is your fault. \n\nI'm split on this too because it isn't really fair to rehome the dog because you're all he's ever known, but at the same time, dedicating time to training him when you have a young baby is near impossible.", "Have you tried some noise reduction headphones?

Here it seems that your husband is being an AH. You are a new mother and he is not taking care of you. Giving birth and taking care of a baby is a lot of work and the dog is adding to the stress of this. Your husband needs to come up with a solution to make sure the dog is not a burden on you. He needs to do this by training it, taking it with him to work or finding some other solution. He needs to understand that giving birth and breastfeeding is a huge burden and is taxing and tiring both physically and emotionally. He needs to take on the relatively small burden of figuring out how to either improve the dog's behavior or finding an appropriate home for the dog. \n\nBased on what you have described, I think you have been patient with the dog's behavior and have not too quickly come to the conclusion that the dog needs to leave the house. My guess is that if the dog's behavior improved, you would be happy to keep the dog in the house. You sound like a very loving person. \n\nBest of luck. I hope your husband can find the right solution for the dog.", "So why did he insist on getting a dog that he can\u2019t help care for?

I agree rehoming the dog is the best and never getting another animal.", "Well I agree the dog needs to be in a better place, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s done everything with the dog it sounds like she just had the kid and decided she didn\u2019t wanna be bothered with him. We get very attached to our animals good or bad.", "NTA. You\u2019re not an AH for being on the verge of a mental breakdown. Telling you that you don\u2019t realise you love the dog is complete disregard of your own right to your own emotions.

When we got him, we thought we couldn\u2019t have kids so his terror around children was easy to deal with. \nAs soon as we had a baby, he would lose his mind and freak out. So we had to find him a home he got better in. He\u2019s living his best life now keeping an eye on puppies at a dog training property - the owner has him as her personal dog & he loves all the pups she brings in. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. If your dog isn\u2019t comfortable in the situation, isn\u2019t fitting well, then find it a place where it will fit.

Just make sure the dog is rehomed properly and your conscience is clear.", "ESH, this is why you research and plan before you adopt a new family member. I have a Italian greyhound mix and they can be very difficult to train, have very high anxiety and absolutely needs to be with their people all the time. You can work through this but it won't be easy and you'll need your husband to step up and help more to offer you some relief.", "You and your baby are humans. You come first. The dog is an animal, a very loved one, but he doesn't come before the people in the household. The dog would actually be better off in home he's not constantly stressed out in anyway. If your husband is going to choose the dog over you and his child then go stay somewhere else for now. NTA", "NTA but I'd say that fundamentally the problems likely aren't with the dog. The vast majorities of dogs aren't untrainable (and the ones that are tend to have extreme behavioral issues where caring for them is just not feasible). And you're super vague about what you did to train your pup but I'd put money on the fact that any rules you did have for it were overridden by someone (your husband?) because it's \"mean\" to not give it snacks when you eat/let it in bed/express itself by howling when excited, or whatever. Dog is not untrainable, but it can't be trained when always getting inconsistent and contradicting messages and ultimately the babying it wins out. Not the dog's fault. \n\nRe-homing your dog to someone who can give it the proper structure it needs to be healthy is in the best interest of you, the baby, AND the dog. You don't have the motivation, energy, or time (understandbly so, being a mom is hard) and the dog needs more than you can give it since you guys (your husband in particular I'd guess) have not been great at raising it, so it should not be with you. You're right about all this. But it very likely won't fix the underlying problem here.", "YTA husband is right. Just yet another woman who has a baby and wants to dump her no longer convenient pet.", "NAH. Re-homing a pet is no small thing. But it sounds intolerable. Just try and find it a good new home.", "Guess you'll have to just get rid of the baby then.", "YTA\n\n>This dog is untrainable. He doesn't listen and he's pretty stubborn. He was worse when he was a puppy.\n\nJust about every dog in the world is trainable with very few exceptions, it does however take real time and effort and consistency between all adults in the house.  For howling there are many types of bark collars including quite gentle ones (test them on yourself first)) which can help otherwise the dog needs clear boundaries and consistency to learn. \n\nYou cant get a dog and expect it to act like a cat, its a member of your pack and needs guidance, constantly.", "Sounds like pup needs some anti anxiety meds.", "Sort of THA- here's why. Dogs are a lot of work and it doesn't matter whether small or big. Big dogs are even more work because they tend to have larger than life personalities. Greyhounds are runners and need the space only a backyard fenced in can give them. They are also hi strung. Talk to your husband about putting the dog in a doggie day care for a couple of days a week till the baby is older and can play with the dog. In the meantime, when the baby is having a nap, play with the dog and tire him out that way you can get a bit of me time. My sister and I had a pure bred Siberian Husky who weighed 125 pounds he was spoiled like a child. He wanted what he wanted and when he wanted it. But, that doesn't mean that because he was that size he got everything. Compromise with your husband and get a large dog crate and crate train him. Use the crate as a punishment and he will learn quickly that if he misbehaves he will go in the crate. It didn't take our dog long to figure that out. Also, take the dog to a dog park and let him run off his energy, just be sure you can get him back. The crate works, try it.", "YTA invest in getting the dog properly trained, you made a commitment.

You will still hear the baby and the dog, but its not so overhelming anymore and it doesn't make you a bad mom. I know a few ppl who put them on regulary if the baby cries bc of colics or smthg, so when you have no chance to calm the baby down with feeding anyway. It allows them to stay calm and relaxed while comforting the screaming baby what  - according to them - helps the baby to calm down faster bc they feel your moods and react to them. As long you are stressed, the baby is stressed too. \n\nIts a shortterm solution, but the baby gets older and will stop crying so much.", ">I have a 5 year old dog, his training started the day I got him and it never stopped - this is an ongoing process.

If he cannot take care of the doggo because of his work why did he adopt one. Sorry of I misinterpreted, but to me it seemed like it is more your husband's dog and you were kind of just ok with him getting it. At least he is the one with more experience so he should be the one training it/ teaching you how to train when he isn't there. So basically it reads to me like he just wanted a dog, so he got one who he thought looked nice, not minding the traits of that breed and dumping all the work on you because he can't take it to work. Great now you have to train it, have to give it enough activity throughout the day and do all the related stuff. \nYou failed the dog yes, but I think this one is on your husband (unless I misinterpreted and you were in fact completly on board with getting poor doggo)\n\nPlus untrained dog with clear emotional issues and problems with the baby in combination with a baby sounds like a really bad idea.

It sounds like you may be similar in some ways.\n\nNTA\n\nI find it downright mean for your husband to say you're a bad person for this. While he's right that the dog is a family member, properly training it requires years of consistency from all sides. Someone else said the owners have to be trained, too.\n\nGreyhounds are bred to be very active dogs. They're literally bred for racing. So it's no surprise to me that this dog is overly attached, barky, and active. It would be like if a homebody person with little space adopted a Bengal cat (VERY beautiful but active breed of cat). They are also not small dogs, either. So I feel like there are layers of oversights here that, while probably not malicious, lead to your distress.\n\nAt some point, your husband is going to have to compromise, and you're going to have to stop. Is there a family member the dog could stay with for a couple of years until the kiddo is in preschool at least? Is there a doggy daycare or something you could look into for certain days?\n\nIf your husband is either unable or unwilling to help you help his family, he might not like the only other available solution, and it would be sad to rehome the pupper.

What is it about this specific scenario that gets you so hyped?", "My wife\u2019s family had to give up the family dog when they had her. She was always needy - she was their baby. So suddenly she got super neurotic when they had a human baby, she just couldn\u2019t handle it - in the they decided that it wasn\u2019t fair on the dog and they didn\u2019t trust her around the baby, so they gave her up in the end. NTA", "ESH I'm so tired to see people getting pets and then having a baby and decide it's all too much now... What did you expect? It's a dog, a living breathing being, not a toy that stays still and silent wherever you put them. And then a baby? I assume you both knew how babies work BEFORE having one? Why are you all so surprised about what's happening? It was so predictable it's literally clich\u00e9.\nYou don't get an animal when you don't want it. You also don't convince your partner to get an animal they don't want and then not take care of them (training).\nYou don't get a pet without researching their breed's needs first and making sure it allines with your lifestyle. \nYou don't try training for a little while and then give up when it doesn't work, you make a solid plan that takes a lot of time and effort.\nBut most importantly, you don't give up a pet.

The problem is the baby is going to need to come first.  And if you have a dog that gets jealous of the baby, you have a problem.  I tell people all the time.  Do NOT get a dog before you have a baby.  It's always best to wait until after the baby is born so the dog knows who takes priority.  As for training, you haven't done enough.  Sending a dog to a trainer doesn't train the dog.  You need to reinforce those training methods constantly, every day.  You can never stop.  I'm guessing you guys didn't spend that much time training him.", "NTA The best thing to do would be to rehome the dog, please don't take him to a shelter where he could be put down. Hopefully there is a family or person out there that can give the dog all of the attention he needs. But the situation now sounds unbearable. Good luck!", "I also wanna know how big of a yard they have, or alternatively how often do they take the dog for a proper running exercise. If the dog doesn't get the exercise their breed requires, it also builds up the dog's anxiety and stress. Greyhounds are originally hunting dogs meant for speed. You can't just take them for a walk and play tug with them for a few minutes and expect them to be satisfied.", "Ask your husband if he\u2019s ok with the dog suffers from severe anxiety.

My dogs sometimes get a collar put on them when they are too bark-y, to keep them from barking at people through the fence. I really never use the shock and just vibrate or beep it. Reddit may act like you're a monster if you do this, but a small vibrate isn't any different than sternly telling a dog no and to stop? They clearly aren't traumatized and love barking all the time and even howling. There are really simple training solutions if OP is willing to try... of course I don't blame her for not wanting to try, since she didn't want a dog in the first place.

The part of the story I don't like is that you gave up after a month or so. You got a pet. You got a responsibility.' If your dog is lost you don't look for an hour then call it quits?

We had to use an electric collar on our dogs to keep them from trying to kill our neighbor's dogs through the fence -- some people might say this is wrong, but when done sparingly and when the alternative is getting rid of the dog it's reasonable.\n\nI don't think rehoming a dog that sleeps on the bed and howls is a very good or moral reason, imo. I understand you're overwhelmed, but a couple small adjustments will fix this.\n\nedit: you should also be able to get a cat in the future.

If you raise one from a puppy especially, you should be willing to keep it through hard times (excluding something like aggression, or if you don't have the money to afford it anymore and it would be better off with someone else.) A little training will easily stop the howling, so then there's no reason to rehome it... \n\nIf think pets are okay to raise and then free to discard when you have kids, you're simply immoral and a bad person?
