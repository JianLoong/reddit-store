The dog is italian greyhound and we got him when he was a puppy, 2 months old. So we are his \"mom and dad\" so to say. \n\nI'm actually a cat person I had cats whole my life, and my family they all have cats. On the other side my husband's family they're all dog people and all of them have dogs. When we wanted to get a pet I wanted a cat but my husband wanted a dog. So I compromised and we got a dog. My husband promised me that dogs aren't difficult if you train them properly.\n\nThis dog is untrainable. He doesn't listen and he's pretty stubborn. He was worse when he was a puppy. Now he is sterilized but still he wants his own way. He doesn't like to sit alone. He is overly attached and needy. He demands to sleep with us even though we tried to train him to sleep i his own bed in our bedroom. So I'm forced to sleep with the dog 3 years now.\n\nHowever I got pregnant and we have a baby now. The dog is too sensitive and can't be around the baby. The baby cries a lot (had a colic the first months) and still she is a baby and cries from time to time. The dog howls in the same time as the baby. They are a choir. So me a tired mother that is breastfeeding needs to be ok with this. But I can't. It's to stressful. It's enough that the baby cries, I can't listen to the dog too, it's too much. Every other day I have a meltdown.\n\nI talked to my husband many times and he says that he understands me but I need to tolarate the dog. The dog only has us. He says that I don't realize that I actually love the dog. That's because I treat the dog good - I feed him, bath him regularly. We cuddle a lot too. I say to him that that's true but it's too much to me right now, the dog is making my life miserable.\n\nHe (my husband) is devastated and says that I'm the worst human being because I want to get rid of the dog. He says that the dog is a family member and I need to accept that. \n\nIs this true?

Your spouse has left you with an anxious pet and newborn. \n\nIt would be best to have the dog re-homed to a more suitable environment for its sake. \n\nDon\u2019t get pets you don\u2019t want.

You've done your best with training but that animal might even be a danger to your child.\n\nAs a parent myself I'd even question owning a well trained dog at this time; properly taking care of one alongside your baby and your home is extremely difficult.  That is unless you have a massive property, other people in your home to help.\n\nThe only angle that you might be an AH from is if you knew that you wanted children in the future and had a definite timeline.", "YTA and I hope you find a different solution. Dogs are not toys which you get rid off after a few years. Ask family to keep the dog from time to time.", "ESH.\n\nDon't get pets you won't commit to. Commit to training and care, and not discarding them when you fuck up the training and care.", "YTA. Your dog is a family member and you can\u2019t just rehome them when it\u2019s inconvenient for you. You could try doggy daycare if you have one near you and your pup gets along well with other dogs. One, they can learn better behaviors from other dogs. Two, it tires them out physically and mentally so your dog may sleep a lot better and not be up with the baby.", "YTA. The dog howls with the baby because he is part of the pack and bonding with the kid.  I'm sure you're exhausted but you're an awful person to just dump the dog.  Hope the kid dumps you in a home when you get old since you're heartless.", "The husband should get rid of the wife!!", "YTA- your husband is correct. You both made a commitment when getting a dog and you\u2019d be TA for getting rid of the dog.", "We did as much as we could. We even paid a trainer to help us. The biggest problem is the howling when the baby cries.", ">As for your husband: a dog should always be treated well, but he has failed this dog\n\nThis is correct, even though you have spent money on dog trainers, the owner needs to be trained as well. It sounds like husband just expected you to be the trainer and he did not participate other than paying for the training and being the fun guy who lets the dog do what he wants. Now the dog is three and has no idea who is the leader in the house + attachment issues. \n\nIf your family cannot commit to the training requirements, another family would be a happier place for the dog. If he is barking all the time he is not happy. \n\nI also say NTA", "I agree neither should have an animal. But what about husbands mental health? Animals have proven to help people through difficult times.\n\nI just hope he gets a good home but they don\u2019t get any animals ever.", "THIS IS THE ONE! If your husband's dead set on the idea that only evil people would re-home a dog, then he needs to be the sort of dog owner whose dog would not be better off re-homed!! \n\nGo, stay with your mom, or dear friends. Get a lovely temporary rental, if you prefer. You deserve a safe space for yourself and your infant. Your hubby needs to show THAT HE'S NOT AN EVIL DOG OWNER, BY IMMEDIATELY GETTING HIMSELF ENROLLED IN BEHAVIORAL TRAINING, so that he can effectively lead your poor, anxiety ridden greyhound to emotional, physical, and behavioral health. \n\nHe needs to become consistent with exercising such a phenomenal athlete of a dog (not leave him to run you ragged), every day, both mentally and physically. He needs to cook healthy foods for them both, to improve doggo's mental and emotional health - and work on recipes for your and baby's return. There are a plethora of emotionally intuitive and brilliant new techniques in dog training, which empower the dog to make use of their innate nature and talents to best advantage. \"Winnie the Cattle Dog's\" owner on TikTok discusses many of them. Ultimately, he needs to create a list of goals - and work to check them off the list, whilst NEVER pressurizing doggo, and ALWAYS pressurizing himself. Obviously, sleeping alone, massively reducing attachment, making doggo safe and calm around infants and children, and reducing anxiety are at the top of the list. \n\nIn the meantime, YOU FOCUS ON YOUR CHILD and YOURSELF!!\u2764\ufe0f", "We did for a while. However a dog trainer is expensive, we have more costs now with the baby, we can't afford it anymore", "Doesn\u2019t sound like any animals would be good for these people. Hopefully the dog finds a good home. But no more animals. They both need to just figure out how to get along for the baby sake. Marriage and children take compromises and a lot of work", "I agree and I think getting a greyhound was a bad breed to start with because they are really dependent on their owners", "He works as a sales person and he has a lot of visits. He is selling machine parts and when he visits clients, sometimes the visits last 2-3 hours. He can't leave the dog in the car for that long time.", "Well my view from this is that she seems to be just picking on the poor dog. Yes the human child comes first but she doesn\u2019t seem to understand that her husband loves his dog.\n\nThey obviously didn\u2019t do what needed to be done with the dog. She showed the stand for the dog when they even first got it. So he went to a couple training centers and they quit because they couldn\u2019t quoteafford\u201c it. They should never get any more animals they obviously can\u2019t Deal with animals", "This. They should rehome the dog - not just dump it at a shelter - and NEVER get another dog since she clearly hates them and husband won't take care of his pet.\n\nEdit: spelling", "I have a 5 year old dog, his training started the day I got him and it never stopped - this is an ongoing process. You don't just throw money at a dog trainer and hope for the best.", "\"We did as much as we could\" is very vague and gives the impression that you took him outside one day and tried to teach him to sit and then gave up. \n\nI have dogs. They are by no means perfect because I didn't dedicate hours to training them every day, but I _did_ do enough to make sure they were well adjusted, potty trained, and they know basic commands. Every dog is different, but no dog _needs_ to sleep in your bed. \n\nWithout you giving details on how you tried to train him, it sounds like you didn't try at all and therefore this is your fault. \n\nI'm split on this too because it isn't really fair to rehome the dog because you're all he's ever known, but at the same time, dedicating time to training him when you have a young baby is near impossible.", "Have you tried some noise reduction headphones? (Lowers the level of noise but still allowed you to hear the baby /noise just not to the point of wanting to run away.\n\nThe lack of sleep and hormones might make you extremely irritable and that could be why you have difficulty with the noise.\n\n\nAlso have you tried bribing your dog with treats to get him to do what you want? Have you paid a trainer to come work with him in your home?", "There's no evidence that the husband has mental health problems. Assuming that he has some, just because he wanted a dog doesn't seem right.", "NTA\n\nThis one was hard for me and little details might make me feel differently. Here it seems that your husband is being an AH. You are a new mother and he is not taking care of you. Giving birth and taking care of a baby is a lot of work and the dog is adding to the stress of this. Your husband needs to come up with a solution to make sure the dog is not a burden on you. He needs to do this by training it, taking it with him to work or finding some other solution. He needs to understand that giving birth and breastfeeding is a huge burden and is taxing and tiring both physically and emotionally. He needs to take on the relatively small burden of figuring out how to either improve the dog's behavior or finding an appropriate home for the dog. \n\nBased on what you have described, I think you have been patient with the dog's behavior and have not too quickly come to the conclusion that the dog needs to leave the house. My guess is that if the dog's behavior improved, you would be happy to keep the dog in the house. You sound like a very loving person. \n\nBest of luck. I hope your husband can find the right solution for the dog.", "So why did he insist on getting a dog that he can\u2019t help care for? It sounds like he wanted the dog and the kid and expects you to be his nanny for both.", "Or any animal. I do feel for the husband because he probably loves his dog very much, and she doesn\u2019t seem to be thrilled with the dog because she didn\u2019t get her cat. I agree rehoming the dog is the best and never getting another animal.", "Well I agree the dog needs to be in a better place, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s done everything with the dog it sounds like she just had the kid and decided she didn\u2019t wanna be bothered with him. We get very attached to our animals good or bad."]}
