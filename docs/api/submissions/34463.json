It's only fair, plus she won't be lying atp. I get that they planned it together, but you can't claim that you're the only one treating when someone else is paying half of the bill. The sister should've told the family at the dinner it was a treat from both sisters, so NTA", "Yeah, your sister totally took all the credit for being a kind and generous person while leaving you in the cold.  If she wants all the credit, she can pay the full bill.\n\nJust remember to thank her for your meal she paid for.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your god-grandma\u2019s question pretty much confirms that your sister either implied or outright stated she was paying for dinner herself. If this sets up the expectation that you alone will host/treat another meal, there\u2019s no reason to contribute to this meal. Sister either needs to clear up any confusion with the family or keep the promise she made.", "NTA she wanted all the glory while only paying half the bill.", "NTA. If you feel bad about not treating, then set up another dinner where YOU treat, or you could make a big scene about paying her your half while in front of as many family members as possible.\n\nIf not, then that\u2019s ok, too. She wants the credit, she pays the price.", "NTA. If she wants all the credit for taking your family out for a meal she can pay all of the bill.", "NTA.  At least she didn\u2019t get the money first from you *then* take all of the credit.\n\nYou do need to develop more of a spine and stop being an AH to yourself. Tell her that either you get half of the credit for treating your family, or she can pay in full to get all of the credit. If she wants to split the cost, you want to see the message she sends to your family letting them know that you are splitting the bill either with her.", "Nope.  Air her shit out in front of everyone.  Don't let her get away with that crap.  Stand your ground.\n\nNTA", "NTA she wanted all the credit and then came to you after for the money. If she really wanted the money then she should have showed the message.", "NTA.  Your sister wanted the credit, so she gets the bill.  Easy-peasy.", "When it is your turn to take the family out I think you should forget to invite her.  She sounds like the type to get you back by ordering all the most expensive items.", "NTA. Your sister wants to have it both ways, the only one credited for treating them but you paying half. \n\nShe should've included you in the message inviting them, saying \"OP and I would like to treat you to dinner\". It clearly didn't say that.", "Soft ESH \n\nYou should have just spoke up at the appropriate time in the conversation and said \u201cactually it\u2019s both our treats, we appreciate everything our family has done! It would be N T A if it hadn\u2019t come up in conversation and you hadn\u2019t had that opportunity.\n\nYour sister is an obvious AH for taking all the credit, refusing to show you the text, and just being difficult.
