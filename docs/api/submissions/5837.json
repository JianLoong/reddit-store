We are not close. He has never had time for me, never wanted me in his life or to be in mine. When he moved out he stayed distant from me. He'd speak to our parents, visit them, but it was like I wasn't there. Over the years I got used to it. One time when I was like 12 our parents asked him if he would let me stay for a weekend because they were attending an adult only wedding. He said no but he didn't just say no, he was clear that he would never want that kind of contact with me. They argued back then over it, not sure how bad it got, but they never asked again and nothing changed between me and him. It always stood out to me that he was almost disgusted to be asked and by the idea that he would need to spend some time with me. He never showed up to my birthdays, never got me anything for Christmas or my birthday. My parents were bothered but always told me once we were both grown our relationship would be more equal and could grow. I think they wanted to believe that more than they actually did.\n\nMy brother has been with the same woman for like 8 years. I've met her a grand total of two times. Now they're engaged and everyone is all excited. His fiancee came over while I was at my parents house for Christmas and asked me to be her bridesmaid. She brought up how they needed to include me since all of her siblings were bridesmaids and groomsmen. I asked if that was the only reason and she went silent because I mean she was asking a stranger for the sake of appearances. So I told her it was nice to offer and all but I couldn't accept and that I wouldn't be attending the wedding.\n\nShe freaked out and went crazy about how my lack of attendance will overshadow the day and sometimes you go for family, even if you're not close to or know the family, because family is important. I ended up having to leave my parents house because they were also unhappy when they heard that I was planning on not going. They told me he's my brother and I should be at his wedding even if I'm not a bridesmaid.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672218580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx52tm/aita_for_turning_down_a_place_as_my_brothers/", "score": 1195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'll just say this, sometimes you gotta do shit you don't want to make your parents happy. They've done a lot for us, sacrificed what they wanted for us, worked so that we could have a better life than they did. It's one night, just go, you don't have to participate, you won't die.", "Birds of a feather...His fiance is just like him.\n\nOP stay away from all wedding activities; there may be some other agenda motivating his fiance that you don't know about. Frankly, you might want to make yourself hard to find for a while.    NTA.    Sorry this all happened to you.", "I dmed you. But call this out. Call out everyone who has enabled this. Mske sure her family and friends know. And ypu really should give her the task of forcing him to sit down and answer your questions if she wants you to be the bridesmaid.

Send everyone a link to this post", "NTA. But I can't help but wonder what triggered his behavior all those years ago. Of course not OP's fault but this 'sibling jealousy' is typically short-lived. I think you should have a very serious conversation with your parents and, if you can, you brother so that this is seriously discussed once and for all. After that, you can either hope things improved or you just move on with your life. But having everyone clearly on the same page would help.

Did he feel forgotten/abandoned when she was born?\n\nSure, maybe he should have grown out of it or gotten over it by now, but I can't help but feel the parents deserve a large share of the blame for this. How many AITA posts do we see from teenagers who are asking if they're the A for not wanting to babysit their siblings for free all the time?

So he did include you.  How do you know he said no to including you?  \n\nI've been in many weddings.  I'm a guy.  Guess what, I still tell the bride how nice it was to be included in their special day, even if she didn't pick me.  \n\nI get it.  You don't speak currently.  And you seem to be ok with that.  All I'm saying is that may not always be the case.  Especially once your parents die.   This is a way to ensure that you probably will never be close.  \n\nSometimes it doesn't hurt to be the bigger person.", "That's not mentioned anywhere actually\n\nConsidering she was asked to be a bridesmaid i suspect just attending is fine", "I think the fiancee is just trying to build bridges,  but she needs to accept that OP does not have a relationship with her brother as per his wishes.", "Agreed!! Lots of photos of yourself in a bridesmaid dress having a great time SOMEWHERE ELSE!! :p", "Parents can't fix this kind of thing. And sometimes the more they try, the worse it gets, as the one who doesn't want the relationship ( or wants the wrong kind of relationship, i.e., the older siblings wants to play parent) just digs in their heels more. It's heartbreaking to a parent, but sometimes not fixable.", "Because he was an ONLY CHILD until OP came along.", "No, don't give her that credit. She must know what's going on - she's been with him for eight years, and she clearly didn't actually *want* OP there herself so much as she just didn't want her family to start asking why the groom's sister isn't there.\n\nIt's purely about keeping up appearances so people don't think badly of them.", "Honestly... it's dumb to just assume she knows the details. I dmed op and encouraged her to give her sil details of the pain she's endured and her brother.

I'd also encouraged her to inform her sils family of the truth too.", "Why would she get involved at all? They're basically strangers.", "Why would the brother be ok with her being there???  The bride must have convinced him somehow but talk about awkward.  OP should stay far away from this rubbish.", "She said it was just for the sake of appearances. So I think she knows he has no time for me and just wanted to look good around her family and friends.", "My much older brother told me it was embarrassing to have a pregnant mother at his age. Maybe those kinds of feelings just morphed into this indifference toward you. I mean, it's extreme, but maybe that's how it started and just went unchecked?", "I don\u2019t understand how your parents can have such a close relationship with him after he so clearly hates you. \n\nI have 2 sons so I just don\u2019t get it from a parents view.", "This invitation to be bridesmaid could offer an opportunity to have that conversation, maybe involving the bride as the 'middle man'. There is clearly something odd going on. If I were the bride, I'd like to know why my husband shows so much animosity towards a family member...", "It's time to apply some pressure. \"Get us in a room together and he has to answer my questions or I cut off my parents and blast how he has treated me to everyone he knows.\"", "I feel like this is the kind of thing nobody will ever know. He's never going to say and everyone else just has no idea. He's still very close to our parents and always was so if it was something like that, he only blamed me.", "Oh no doubt this is because of childhood jealousy / resentment. Young children don't like new children coming into play. Especially half-siblings. So the parents probably didn't handle things right.\n\nBut this guy is by far a grown ass man. This is really something he should've reflected on and overcome by now. At this point I don't think its fair to hold anyone responsible anymore but him.", "Not even then. They know how he has treated her. They still have unrealistic expectations that they will hug it out and suddenly have a fantastic relationship. Maybe her not going to the wedding will show them that this is in fact not going to happen.  \n  \nI saw this scenario play out with my father and his brother, my uncle, it didn't resolve until my uncle watched his mother being lowered into the ground, and he realised the last person who loved him was dead.", "Yeah unfortunately this is really common. I have 2 older brothers only a couple of years apart and they never liked each other or got along. My eldest brother said that he never liked my other brother since his birth. I think it may be because he wanted to be the only son ( so if my other brother was born a girl, he probably wouldn't have had a problem with him). They have only spoken a couple of words to each other in an entire year despite living under the same roof.", "We're pretty identical in appearance so I doubt it, but who knows.", "I'm not doing that but it's not like I have his number anyway.", "Honestly how is he her brother when he treats her like this?", "She told me he said no. I asked and got an honest answer from her on that.\n\nI don't see a day where he would ever talk to me. At one time I would have killed for it. But it was hurtful and damaging to be rejected, ignored, shown that he did not love me or want me to be born. Can you even imagine how that feels as a kid? To see him talk to everyone, enjoy everyone, be close to those closest with you but make it clear he has no place for you in his life.", "Are you reading a single thing OP is writing? You're projecting your own stuff onto her situation. She wanted to be close to her brother but he has spent 19 years! ignoring her and making it clear he doesn't view her as family, let alone a stranger worthy of basic respect. They will never be close because of HIS actions- nothing to do with OP. \n\nAnd honestly good for you OP. You don't know your brother or fiance from a random acquaintance and you need to prioritize your emotions and well-being.", "Fiancee saw OP twice in 8 years, she *knows*.", "What I got out of it is she is more concerned about appearances than trying to bond with OP.", "It's not about building bridges. This is just for the sake of appearances.", "OP, Absolutely NTA.  I admit, I would go to the wedding but not be a bridesmaid.   I would treat him like a distant cousin that I see on holidays.  I would go to the wedding, say hi to my great aunts, give a nice gift, and then leave before things get crazy at the reception.    BUT that is just me.  You get to make your own choices.", "Seriously. Eight years is a long to *not* be aware of your fianc\u00e9's family dynamics. Either she is highly aware of what's going on or she is dense and oblivious. Both of these are very bad looks on her part.", "Maybe. I'll honestly never know.", "The bride invited me just because of appearances, not because she is interested in having a relationship. She couldn't even say she wanted me. Just that it would look a certain way for me not to be.", "I know this isn\u2019t the nice take but the reality is he doesn\u2019t need to love you or want a relationship with you. Family isn\u2019t just who you share blood with. He\u2019s decided he doesn\u2019t see you as family, but in then, you\u2019ve decided you don\u2019t see him as family either. It doesn\u2019t need to be some evil, hate filled decision. It can just be two adults who happen to share blood deciding that\u2019s the extent of their relationship, and that\u2019s okay. But it\u2019s on your brother to deal with the fallout. Stay strong and just repeat to anyone who comments, \u201cfamily is more than just blood, and me and (brother) have decided we clearly aren\u2019t family. Please respect that decision.\u201d", "I think they were asking if he could be your father and your parents adopted you at birth since he was so young.", "You don't even have his number.  Woof...everyone giving her shit, let that sink in.  She doesn't have her own brother's number.\n\nNTA Clearly he is not your brother OP, only in the biological sense.  It sounds like you have processed this dynamic quite clearly through the years.  You are simply keeping up with the standard that your parents have allowed and supported the last 19 years, an \"appearance\" that his fiance has also supported for 8 years.", "This is heartbreaking to read. Do not attend the wedding to be a prop. He made a decision and the consequences for you have been very painful. His marriage means one more person who ignores you at family events. Why should you put on a dress and celebrate that?", "Even if she didn't, is freaking out really a reasonable response? I understand her being upset, but \"no\" is an acceptable answer to the fianc\u00e9es' request. Maybe not the one she wanted, but I feel she should have kept her upset to herself and maybe try to talk to OP in private, later. This response gives me adult temper tantrum vibes.", "I dunno, I've heard of ppl flipping the script on SOs to save face. \"She never wanted to be a part of my life so I've stopped trying, that's why we haven't spoken in 8 years. I never did anything but try to include her\". Bs like that.", "Not only does she know but brother and SIL deserve each other. Inviting someone to be included so things appear normal is asshole behavior.", "If they say it's about building bridges, tell everyone you've been out of bricks since you were 12.\n\nAnd the thing about invitations - they're not subpoenas.  NTA.", "She had 8 years to build that bridge. So, yeah you are so right. NTA", "I'm so sorry for this.", "Ughhhh. You don't owe them anything. Good for you for saying no.", "I've seen photos of my mom pregnant with me so I don't think that's it.", "I don't have his number, we are not social media contacts, I don't know where he lives, have never been inside his house, any of his houses, and don't really know how I would contact him if an emergency happened.", "This isn\u2019t about getting along. He would have to acknowledge her existence for them to not get along. He doesn\u2019t even do that much. There\u2019s nothing to lose because they have no relationship.\n\nETA: He\u2019s not even upset that she won\u2019t be there. The fianc\u00e9 and the parents are the ones who care.", "Yeah, and not even just putting on a dress but paying for a gift, paying for a hotel for the night potentially and having a big expense to attend the wedding of someone who wishes I had never been born.", "Yeah, this is clearly the fianc\u00e9e being worried about \"what will people think?!\" rather than being upset for herself or the groom for missing out on company that they want to be with them.", "I love this so much, invitation =/= subpoenas YES", "That sucks.  For whatever reason he has, he has a boundary.  I bet it's the stupidest of reasons - the kind of decision that a 13 year old kid makes and keeps going cause that is all they got.  But that is not your fault and you are allowed to feel however you want to feel about it, and in return have your own boundary.  It honestly doesn't even sound like something you are losing sleep over it.  You are a caring person though because you are here worried about others, like your parents.\n\nYour parents failed both of you.  This is 19 years in the making that they have to face.  I'm sorry but keep doing what you are doing.  You seem to have it more together than any of these so called adults."]}
