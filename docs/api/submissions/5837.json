We are not close. He has never had time for me, never wanted me in his life or to be in mine. When he moved out he stayed distant from me. He'd speak to our parents, visit them, but it was like I wasn't there. Over the years I got used to it. One time when I was like 12 our parents asked him if he would let me stay for a weekend because they were attending an adult only wedding. He said no but he didn't just say no, he was clear that he would never want that kind of contact with me. They argued back then over it, not sure how bad it got, but they never asked again and nothing changed between me and him. It always stood out to me that he was almost disgusted to be asked and by the idea that he would need to spend some time with me. He never showed up to my birthdays, never got me anything for Christmas or my birthday. My parents were bothered but always told me once we were both grown our relationship would be more equal and could grow. I think they wanted to believe that more than they actually did.\n\nMy brother has been with the same woman for like 8 years. I've met her a grand total of two times. Now they're engaged and everyone is all excited. His fiancee came over while I was at my parents house for Christmas and asked me to be her bridesmaid. She brought up how they needed to include me since all of her siblings were bridesmaids and groomsmen. I asked if that was the only reason and she went silent because I mean she was asking a stranger for the sake of appearances. So I told her it was nice to offer and all but I couldn't accept and that I wouldn't be attending the wedding.\n\nShe freaked out and went crazy about how my lack of attendance will overshadow the day and sometimes you go for family, even if you're not close to or know the family, because family is important. I ended up having to leave my parents house because they were also unhappy when they heard that I was planning on not going. They told me he's my brother and I should be at his wedding even if I'm not a bridesmaid.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672218580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx52tm/aita_for_turning_down_a_place_as_my_brothers/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because the pictures will last a lifetime and they probably want those but that\u2019s not your problem. \n\nIt would be \u201cpolite\u201d of you to compromise and still go to the wedding as a guest.

Even though you don\u2019t like each other,  eventually you and brother will have to make decisions on care for aging parents (which is either time or money intensive) and deal with their stuff/assets when they die. So if money is the main consideration, you have a lot more on the line than the cost and time of attending the wedding. Are you going to work together to deal with dementia mom or hip replacement dad or to help pay for their nursing home? Hopefully you won\u2019t have to deal with this, but I do fear most usually it is the young daughter who gets left to figure it all out. You just sound extremely young so that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m raising this. I am wary of the young daughter getting left to care for aging parents, and I don\u2019t imagine skipping brothers\u2019 wedding sets you up for very good adult relations with him\u2026. He does sound like a crappy brother but you have 364 other days in the year to get back at him, whereas choosing this one seems unnecessarily risky for you\u2026 Sort of seals the deal that everything else to come in adult life will be hostile and low contact too.", "You don't have to get along but I beleive that it's still the right move to go, I never got along with my sister and after we turned 18 we both left and stopped talking completely after she passed at (23) it was the worst moment of my life if I could have spent any more time with her I would have if I could have gone back I would spend every day with her. You never know what you have until it's gone and you can't see it again", "But he has no interest in having a conversation with me. I see no chance for that to change. He's never wanted me, never loved me, made it clear there is no place for me in his life. The man has spent my whole life wishing I had never been born.

Difference is it sounds like you had a relationship with your sister. Tumultuous yes, but a relationship. Sounds like OP never has.", "Sorry you went through that, but OP's feelings are valid, and I really feel you are diminishing them and overlooking what she is saying. \n\nHer brother never was a \"brother\" to her. She explained in the post that he didn't want anything to do with her her entire life. Now they want her to participate in a wedding only for appearances, that is not only insulting but completely soul crushing added on to what she has already been through. \n\nWhy should she  be obligated to stand in the fire just to keep him warm?\n\nNTA", "It's more than not getting along. There is no love between us. No care. He has done his best to ignore my existence and wish me away since I was born. I don't know him, have not spent enough time with him, for me to miss anything. That's all his decision. I would have given anything for us to be closer when I was younger. But we are not important to each other now.
