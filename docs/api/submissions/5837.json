{"id": 5837, "submission_id": "zx52tm", "title": "AITA for turning down a place as my brother's fiancee's bridesmaid and telling her I won't be attending their wedding?", "selftext": "My brother is 13 years older than me and I have known my whole life, all 19 years, that he would have preferred to remain an only child. We are not close. He has never had time for me, never wanted me in his life or to be in mine. When he moved out he stayed distant from me. He'd speak to our parents, visit them, but it was like I wasn't there. Over the years I got used to it. One time when I was like 12 our parents asked him if he would let me stay for a weekend because they were attending an adult only wedding. He said no but he didn't just say no, he was clear that he would never want that kind of contact with me. They argued back then over it, not sure how bad it got, but they never asked again and nothing changed between me and him. It always stood out to me that he was almost disgusted to be asked and by the idea that he would need to spend some time with me. He never showed up to my birthdays, never got me anything for Christmas or my birthday. My parents were bothered but always told me once we were both grown our relationship would be more equal and could grow. I think they wanted to believe that more than they actually did.\n\nMy brother has been with the same woman for like 8 years. I've met her a grand total of two times. Now they're engaged and everyone is all excited. His fiancee came over while I was at my parents house for Christmas and asked me to be her bridesmaid. She brought up how they needed to include me since all of her siblings were bridesmaids and groomsmen. I asked if that was the only reason and she went silent because I mean she was asking a stranger for the sake of appearances. So I told her it was nice to offer and all but I couldn't accept and that I wouldn't be attending the wedding.\n\nShe freaked out and went crazy about how my lack of attendance will overshadow the day and sometimes you go for family, even if you're not close to or know the family, because family is important. I ended up having to leave my parents house because they were also unhappy when they heard that I was planning on not going. They told me he's my brother and I should be at his wedding even if I'm not a bridesmaid.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: some stuff has come up commonly and I wanted to add some extra details. My brother is very close to our parents. He always has been and they know his fiancee very well since they've seen her a lot. I was just simply never included in that. But my brother never appeared to have any hard feelings toward our parents. Only ever me.\n\nHis fiancee has admitted she only invited me for appearances sake and that my brother said no to including me in his wedding party. \n\nMy brother and I look very alike. Which is a mix of  both our parents. I have seen pictures of my mom while pregnant with me so unless they really faked those, he's not my bio father.\n\nI've had more of a conversation with Redditors posting on this than I've had with him in 19 years.", "created_utc": 1672218580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx52tm/aita_for_turning_down_a_place_as_my_brothers/", "score": 3750, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whenever the family went out, I'd be the \"chaser,\" which meant I followed him around to keep him safe as he wandered around wherever we were. We'd play together after  I got home from school until I needed to sit and do homework. Then we'd sit near each other and he'd quietly watch TV as I worked.\n\nHe also saved my life, as I had to move out thanks to emotional, verbal, and psychological abuse from my father and stepmother. I was severely depressed the last year I lived in that house, and it was him showing me how much he loved me helped counteract our parents telling me how horrible I was. Both him and my baby half-sister were always so happy to be with me that I knew someone loved me and was glad I was there. When I escaped that house, I lost all contact with my younger siblings thanks to our parents.\n\nI'm not part of my younger half-siblings lives now, because it's too painful to be reminded of that time. I don't know what horrible lies they were told about me. He sent me a friend request on Facebook that took me a few years to accept.

If he doesn\u2019t want contact, fine.. but then they need to let you set your own boundaries on how to move forward. \n\nSeems everyone forgot that since he\u2019s 13 years old you were the baby through all of this!

Your brother has some deep seated issues with you, possibly stemming from jealousy.\n\nI am in a similar situation as you are, where I am much younger than my brother (12 years).

Idk how they have WATCHED all this happen and then want to make you the bad guy. \u201cSorry for all of us ignoring how you feel about being completely isolated and ignored by your brother, but honey FaMiLY, it\u2019s what\u2019s most important. Not the fact that you have been completely alienated from their lives, until now because how sweet of them for wanting to include you after all this time!\u201d Makes no sense and it\u2019s so wacky that because he\u2019s getting married now you have an obligatory role that ceased to exist till that moment.", "So they've made allowances for him in regards to not having you present in his presence, but they're not willing to make an allowance for you in your same desire to not be in his presence? For as long as this has been going on they've enabled his behavior by bending to his will in his desire to not spend time with you, yet they are trying to bend you to their will despite YOUR desire not to spend time with HIM (and he doesn't even care anyway)?\n\nYou obviously don't have a brother, and by extension will not have a SIL. If you wish to preserve your relationship with your parents, I advise that you maybe sit down and have an honest talk with them about their enabling, their hypocrisy, and their willful ignorance over this whole situation. I cannot imagine how painful it would be to have to split time that way between children, but I also cannot imagine putting the desires of one child above the other so consistently. Your parents should have your back here, as they've had his.", "Based on the lack of communication, I doubt you even have his number. Have you ever just asked him point blank: \u201cCan you just get straight to point and tell me why you don\u2019t acknowledge my existence or what I ever did to you?\u201d \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t reply within an hour, \u201cYou\u2019re a 32 year old man with a vendetta against someone who didn\u2019t have a choice of being born. For all intents and purposes, I\u2019m an only child as well.\u201d", "You're right. I'm sorry OP your brother and parents are trash. :( Hugggs", "You can see my last comment for more detail, but I was 13 when my parents adopted 2 kids. I held a lot of resentment about that for a very long time and I intentionally kept distance partly so that I wouldn\u2019t take that resentment out on my siblings.\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but I can imagine it was difficult for your brother to feel established in his relationship with his parents to have it suddenly change at that age. As long as he\u2019s not been actively hostile to you, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s necessarily done anything wrong, either. It\u2019s a crap situation for both of you, and I\u2019m sorry you had to grow up with that.", "Oh trust me they BOTH will knock on OP\u2019s door when they need a free babysitter. Give it a year or two. Probably the only reason why the fiance wants a relationship with OP now..", "Nah, that's dumb too. If the parents don't know the majority already they're shitty parents, if they already do they're still shitty parents.", "The fianc\u00e9 was with him for about a year when the parents asked him to babysit a tween OP. In 8 years, she has met his sister less than a handful of times. She has probably never even heard anything about her or know anything about her in all that time. I get not asking about distant family, but people should know the basics of their partner's immediate family. If in all the time she never learned a goddam thing about her potential future SIL, then she didn't find it that important.\n\nAt best, the fianc\u00e9 was putting her head in the sand and ignoring the issue. She may have thought, \"Its between them. It has nothing to do with me.\" which is technically correct. Still, now everybody she knows will know now that it will affect her, she cares. It may be because now the missing motivations behind a brother cutting off his much younger sister for apparently no reason is honestly a red flag for her, but it seems more likely she is more interested in the aesthetics and proper tradition of her wedding that she is more interested in.", "Nah. No pass. After eight years I cannot imagine she hasn\u2019t figured it out.", "she freaked out at OP. Fiancee's used her pass and OP should pass on this wedding where she'd have an awful time.", "Possibly fiance has been working on brother to accept his sister more..this could have been the start of their relationship somewhat healing. Fiance freaking out could be because she has spend years coaxing brother to be accepting of sister and freaked out when sister also said no so all her work sort of fell apart...i dont know, thats all speculative. Fiance could be a real sweetheart...but OP is defiantly NTA", "I think they could have put a boundary where they're not so close with the son if he refuses to acknowledge the daughter. They enabled his behavior by maintaining a close relationship with him while letting him be so cruel to their other child.", "I was an only child for 10 years.  Kids are assholes but hey, you fight with your siblings like a normal kid and then eventually, you relate on a different level when you\u2019re older.\n\nTo harbor this much resentment for 19 years is just absurd.  Seriously, therapy like yesterday but it\u2019s too late for that.  He can be however he wants to be with whatever bullshit reason he wants to create, but that doesn\u2019t mean that OP has to go with it or understand it.  He and his fianc\u00e9 are all strangers to her.", "NTA. If I were you, I would tell her to have him ask you to be at the wedding for you to even ~consider it, and see how quickly they drop this whole thing.", "I don\u2019t think he clearly hates her\u2014 I think you have to know someone to hate them & he doesn\u2019t know her. He\u2019s indifferent to her. Completely disinterested. Poor girl hasn\u2019t done anything to deserve this. I agree it\u2019s baffling how her parents can have a close relationship with him\u2026 I\u2019d be furious with him. I doubt I\u2019d be at the wedding.", "Often, sons are prized a great deal, and daughters not so much. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/4k8tqnJXK9M", "He's been hostile to me a few times over the years but mostly just ignored me and avoided me.", "I don't see what gives you this impression.", "Are you sure you are both your parents child? \n\nHe is treating you like you are a affair child.", "Yes, exactly. She deserves the right to tell her side of the story, as I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of denying and minimizing of the impact on her. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "They do know. They've talked about it plenty. They just don't care enough to tell you. Theres a reason your whole family is so non chalant about it and it's not confusion. Best of luck but id tell my sister in law and parents to make it happen. He's gonna give me his time and attention and look me in the eye and tell me why he put me through so much pain. Or I'm distancing myself from my parents and telling to truth to all the people at the wedding that you've been asked to put on appearances for. \"Nobody knows\" and \"he doesn't owe you anything\" would no longer be acceptable to me. Or I stand up at the wedding and confront him in front of everybody. If you want me to do such and such then I need such and such in return. Especially when that such and such is just your brother talking to you.", "And what do you bet she made a big thing about asking his sister to be a bridesmaid so now there\u2019s no way of glossing over her absence. Probably would have gone unnoticed otherwise based on how little her brother has to do with her.", "Why would she get a pass?  She\u2019s marrying someone who treats his sister terribly.  She\u2019s as bad as he is.", "Yeah well the 13 year old boy almost certainly felt that way and the parents clearly did nothing to remedy it. Of course he never felt a sibling-like relationship with the kid. They were a screaming baby, then a screaming toddler and then he was an adult and moved out. By the time the kid was old enough to develop relationships revolving around anything other than needing care the eldest was already gone.", "I knew several kids growing up who had that kind of age gap with their younger siblings, and they were all bonkers for those baby sibs. \n\nMy sister is 5 years younger than me, and we didn\u2019t get along for a long time as kids, but you can bet your ass I wanted nobody else but her to be my maid of honor as an adult.", "Op should make sure everyone knows the real reason.", "Dear girl, I\u2019m so sorry about this. Baffling. I have a younger brother I wish I was closer to, and I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so cold to me. My efforts to get together and try to talk it through have been rebuffed. I know the feeling of just having to accept the way it is. Frustrating, especially about parents. He was my late mother\u2019s favorite. A big consolation has been having my own loving family and wonderful friends. I love my kids & now I have a yummy grandson. I applaud your decision to avoid the wedding altogether. You have so much to look forward to once you can put some distance between yourself and this situation. Good luck!!!", "But  then he wouldn't need to prove that he doesn't care so much. Not getting her gifts for Christmas when they're celebrating together is wild! If he didn't care about his sister, he would just get her scented candles, to get it done with. A thoughtless gift is indifferent, but never gifting anything at all implies rancor. It might seem contradictory, but ignoring someone thoroughly takes effort.", "In that case, he\u2019s definitely an asshole. You didn\u2019t choose to be in that family and at the very least he needed to treat you with courtesy and respect, even if he can\u2019t bring himself to love or even like you.", "Yes, as far as I know. We look very alike and we're a perfect mix of mom and dad.", "You're not wrong they are freaking out unnecessarily not saying they aren't. Not mentioning it is a base level thing that I would expect but it seems like the SIL is incapable.", "That's what I think. People are here calling him a narc but I'm not so sure. I mean, he could be. But this is different \n\nIt must be intense to be 13 and suddenly the whole dynamic changes. Who isn't going through shit at 13? But mom and dad are fully busy and completely exhausted, and maybe asking you to babysit. You used to be the only one and now you're a much, much lower priority. And anyone who thinks a 13 year old is equipped to deal with that can... talk to me at age 13. \n\nI think of one situation in particular, the youngest was so by 11 years. It ripped the family apart for a while. When the older ones discuss the \"baby\" and what he got away with, they still get a little miffy. 20 years later. \n\n I'm not defending big bro here. He's committed to being an asshole. he's too old to let his resentments fuel such discord. I just think it's the parents who dropped the ball.", "[deleted]", "Sorry ir sucks. My brother is like this to our youngest brother. The most I ever got out of him is that they were not treated the same. They were. People don\u2019t make any sense some times. I wouldn\u2019t take it personal and F their wedding. F it in the A.", "Ok, thanks for clarifying! Not that it would in any way excuse his behaviors even if he were a father or a half-brother. However, it could point to a different magnitude of his own shit that he needs to deal with. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your brother isn\u2019t a better brother. You don\u2019t deserve that and I think your actions are fully justified.", "He's been with his fiance for 8 years. Now they're getting married, there is presumably the possibility of children. Watch this juvenile guy with zero self-awareness displace his animosity from the disruption of his 8 year relationship onto his own children.", "They aren't trying to mend it. They are actively being horrible to her by making it clear she is used as a prop. Why try to do so? Brother has made his opinion clear from age 13-32. you're entirely ignoring where brother's fiancee went off on her", "It's like a Hallmark Christmas movie where all of the sudden and without any explanation or back story. Everyone is suddenly one happy family. And heirs to an entire freaking country. \n\nNTA", "Yeah. There are all sorts of ways to help an older child get used to the idea of a younger one, but it seems as if they just ignored the problem and assumed kinship would somehow make them close.", "He can waste her time and energy demanding awnser that she might never had. Her brother doesn't care about her or what people think about How he feels about OP.", "Yeah, being like this with this kind of gap is *gross*.  Even if they parentified the crap out of him and he lost out on his childhood because they had OP and made him take care of her, he should be mad at them.  And he didn't, he's just a narcissist who has been completely indulged.  He's the AH, and so are your parents.  The fiancee is either a fool and marrying Darth Vader (there's good in him, I feel it!) or she's cut from the same cloth.\n\nGo find people who will value you enough not to allow others to mistreat you, OP.  This is all garbage and I'm sorry. \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\udc94"]}
