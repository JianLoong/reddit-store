My concerns when I posted were that I was being overly emotional/critical in demanding that my friend Bethany (31F) remove any photos of me (23F) wearing her lingerie from her website and storefront. The response here was unanimous that I was not. All the law talk was a little confusing, but I was just relieved to know that I wasn't being a bitch.\n\nI spoke to a lawyer. He said, no, she had no implied right to the photos. Because this was not art but commerce, a model release had to be in place for legal ownership and rights to the photos to pass to Bethany from the photographer. It would be up to Bethany to prove that she had rights, which she would have to go to court for. That could go either way, so it'd be better to resolve it between us. He offered to draw up any documents or file anything I needed, just to let him know.\n\nThen I went to the storefront to speak to the owner. The poster in the window was already taken down. She had received a call from the city that some complaints had been made that the photo was up in public view. She decided it wasn't worth the hassle and took it down. I have the poster now.\n\nI talked to the photographer next. He said that he was under the impression that the model release was in place. He sold his rights to the photos as a cost of the shoot. Without any release, he agreed to not deliver any more photos to Bethany. He still had about 200 to edit. He showed me the cropped and photoshopped photos as well. Bethany was correct that the altered photos did not work. It's difficult to photoshop see-through lace, allegedly.\n\nI texted Bethany and asked if we could meet. She said she was hoping I'd reach out again, we set a time and place. When we met up, she immediately apologized for being tough on me, that she was wrapped up in her business and didn't think about anything else. I accepted her apology, then told her what the lawyer said. Her lawyer said something similar, but she brought along a release in case I wanted to sign it. I told her I would think about it. We talked about our friendship and agreed that it was likely over. We spoke for a long time, she apologized again and asked that I stay in touch. She would send me an offer for a signed release.\n\nOverall, not a huge blow up or legal battle. Just someone with tunnel vision about their passion. Still, it woke me up to some realities that I was ignoring when I moved here. I still have decisions to make about staying or going, where to go (home or Cali), how I make friends and what I value. All this has shaken me badly and I'm scared. I figured out early that men were doing things for me because they wanted to sleep with me, and that was jarring, but this was the first time a woman has taken advantage of me because of how I look. I'm questioning a lot of my life. It's a lonely thing to realize that you don't have allies anywhere.\n\nWell, that's it. Thanks again, sorry it didn't end in a more exciting way.\n\nEDIT: Got the offer. It's low. Said no. All done.  Going back and reading, it's funny to me that you can see me progressively get drunker with responses lol", "created_utc": 1677595968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11e9ego/update_aita_for_withdrawing_permission_to_use/", "score": 662, "replies": ["As a photographer, please always make sure you have a model release and understand what the images are being used for. If you are not ok with even a line in the release, DO NOT SIGN IT.", "Im glad she and you spoke, it sounds like you\u2019ve got your head screwed on properly. Unfortunately you will find people of both sexes willing to take advantage - but there are a lot of awesome people out there too, who will help you along the journey!\n\nIm also glad that she apologised. Sorry you had to go through this ordeal! Best of luck whatever you decide x", "Quite frankly, I'd set fire to the release - she's already shown her hand in willingness to ignore your wishes, so I'd expect her to treat it as a carte blanche if you sign the damn thing and potentially have to chase it again if she does some mental gymnastics to think she's ok ignoring your requests. \n\nIf she can't be a friend without you signing the release, then yeah, she really ain't much of a friend. \n\nI hope you can find friends that value you for you.", "I'm sorry that this happened to you. Most people are decent people, but capable of making bad decisions when they have tunnel vision.", "I'm glad things are working out in your favor. I wouldn't sign that release, though. Did your boyfriend apologize for making light of your situation? That wasn't cool of him.", "I'm glad you have at least a somewhat happy ending from all this, in the sense that things have worked out as best they could have in this case.  And thank you for the update, I remember your OP and was wondering how that was going to turn out.\n\nJust be careful, and good luck wherever the future takes you, whether it's home, California, or anywhere else...", "Hang in there, OP. I know things are difficult for you, but you can do this. I hope life eases up on you soon.", "You realize that she was told that you could sue her, right? That's why she was so concillatory and brought that document that you could sign, \"in case you were interested\".", "Don't sign the release. Don't let emotion or friendships sway you, you are entitled to your privacy and your rights.\n\n\nYou are doing good. Keep your chin up, and do what you need to do (whether staying or leaving).\n\nBest of luck, and lots of well wishes", "I suggest you start by deciding on your own moral compass. Have a huge think about what you believe is right or wrong. For instance things like lying. Do you believe in telling the truth all the time, or that some little white lies are okay?  It makes it a lot easier dealing with other people if you are not wishy washy on your own stance. It is hard to be manipulated and bamboozled if you have a clear code of conduct. If people make promises get it in writing and read it very carefully. For instance a friend of mine introduced me to her friend and I heard her tell a bunch of horrendous lies to her boss on her phone. I decided if she is lying like that to her boss, she would do the same to me, so I wasn't interested in being friends, as I have a zero tolerance towards lying. I think you will be less scared if you know yourself better and have a firmer grounding. It is easier to deal with people if you know yourself and have a code book to live by. It is harder to be conned, especially if you tell people you want to sleep on decisions.", "INFO are the photos off her site too?", "I doubt the opportunity would even present itself, but if it did, I don't think I'd do it. I spent the night crying after that sit down and have wanted to throw up since.", "Thank you, appreciated.", "Thanks. I believe that as well, that most people are good and/or have good intentions but get overwhelmed. Ambition can do funny things, and especially with business in America being bulldoze everyone in your path to make it at all costs.", "Just a first date, not a boyfriend. He didn't get any better as the night went on and tried to comfort in an unwelcome way. I told him I didn't want to see him again. He didn't take it well, said some fun stuff. Bullet dodged.", "Thank you. Turned out better than things probably could have, I suppose. Doesn't matter, it's over now.", "Yeah, pretty white girl is depressed about bullshit, news at 11. I feel ridiculous that this is tearing me up at all.", "I'm trying not to spend my time and energy assigning motivations or processes to her actions. They're not on me and it doesn't accomplish anything except putting me in a panic to try and play a 4D chess mindgame with someone whom I no longer have a relationship. I'm not going to sue unless it develops more. Things are resolved to my satisfaction.\n\nThe offer will come in for the release. I have a number in my head that I'm comfortable with. If she pays it, and the release has my conditions in it, I'll sign.", "Of course your call, but...don't sign the release. You owe her absolutely nothing after the way she treated you. IMHO, this apology was way too little and way too late.", "oh, honey, you feel violated, and that's totally understandable.\n\nI'm a photographer, and I'm honestly shocked that the photog would release any of these images without having the signed release in their hands. They are liable for that. Also, it's not exactly easy, but it's also not hard to edit out details in sheer/lace etc. Anyone who told you that is not good at their job. \n\nI'm sure they're great images, but it doesn't matter. You wanted them used in a certain way, and you weren't respected.", "It's not ridiculous at all. You have every right to feel everything that you're feeling. You're going through a rough patch, and of course you're going to have feelings about that. But it doesn't make it ridiculous, or bullshit.", "If you aren't allowed to be upset about this situation, then no one is allowed to be upset about anything ever. You were lied to and betrayed by a \"friend\" who decided that your boundaries didn't need to be respected because of your appearance. Please feel free to feel all of your feelings because what she did was completely deplorable.", "It is absolutely valid to feel that way when someone violates your trust. \n\nWhen you moved here, what was your original goal? Is there a way to recenter yourself and feel like you're making progress or finding community? Maybe we can offer some ideas.", "Hey man, don\u2019t compare yourself to others! What you went through hurt, and you have every right to feel that hurt. Now you can move on and see the lesson for what it is.", "Make sure to have your own lawyer comb through it too so she can\u2019t do some slippery stuff without your knowledge that may be allowed by general/vague word play in the release.", "After college in LA, I moved to where I am primarily because my job was remote/travel, it didn't pay enough to live in LA, I had burned through most of my savings with college and I didn't think the values of my circle there reflected who I wanted to be.\n\nThey were all partying, all the time. Trying to find industry events and people, dating the wealthy or famous, getting taken to Nobu or backstage at Hollywood Bowl. I couldn't wake up on the floor of some bassist's house in Laurel Canyon anymore. Covid happened and everything stopped, and I realized I didn't have a meaningful relationship with any of these people or myself. I was 97 lbs and had a 2.4 GPA. I lost my scholarship. I knuckled down and got out of academic probation during lockdown, graduated, and decided to try somewhere else. \n\nI guess I wanted to meet authentic people and try to be more authentic to myself.", "Yeah, he already has the copy she gave me. I don't know when the offer will come, but he'll get a copy of that too.", "Yeah I definitely wouldn\u2019t sign. She clearly doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, but there are still lots of cool, genuine people out there. So don\u2019t give up hope. If you\u2019re looking for someone to talk to in LA, let me know! 25F here always on the look out for new friends", "Don't sign the release and get the copyright back.", "> Just someone with tunnel vision about their passion. \n\nNo, just somebody making convenient excuses in the hopes that you won't actually think that, as a human being, they're responsible for their choices.", "Wow funny how she changed her mind and came to her senses AFTER speaking to her lawyer. \n\nIt\u2019s almost as if she was told she wouldn\u2019t have a leg to stand on if this went anywhere but away.", "I think you handled it well.  Personally, I wouldn't sign the release.  Bethany betrayed your trust, and I think even after that meeting, is only looking out for her business and her own self interests.  You don't owe her that signed release.  \n\nI hope whatever you decide to do, you make some new, true friends.  They are hard to find for everyone, but they are out there.", "I do have my own rules, but I wouldn't say I have a code that is that strict. I usually trust my gut, but I should reevaluate that. My guts are stupid.", "I can't tell, looks like she took down the whole thing.", "Oh buddy, I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. You were trying to help out a friend and she took advantage of that. Not at all cool and also not your fault.", "Why on earth would you consider signing it?  Honestly, I think you're being dumb.\n\n1 - Bethany is a shit business partner.  You already know who she is: she took advantage of you for money.  You now know this.  If you continue in business with her, you deserve what you're going to get.  See also the story of the scorpion and the frog.  I can't emphasize this enough: decent people don't act this way.  If you go into business with people like Bethany, it's highly likely that you're going to have to aggressively enforce the rules of your agreement.  Why would you voluntarily let that energy into your life?  For a couple grand?\n\n\"Oh, I just used your face on a couple pages because it just looks better\", etc.  Keep in mind: with the advancements in AI, it's becoming increasingly feasible to bulk match people's faces from images sourced everywhere.  This happened in Russia with some jerk matching actresses who'd done porn to their VK (russian facebook) profiles.\n\n2 - Why are you not demanding all photos be taken down and destroyed?\n\nReplace your attorney if necessary.  Find one who will tell Bethany that if another photo of you ever surfaces, you're going to end up in court.  Not only will you win, but you will make it as expensive as possible for her.  Or don't, but what you originally said was basically \"I don't want my half-naked body paraded around with my face.\"  *if* that's your goal, pick a different attorney and go get it.  And don't be a pushover.", "There\u2019s absolutely no reason for you to feel anything but justified in how you reacted. Unfortunately, you are not the first or the last person this has happened to. I\u2019m sure if you connected with a bunch of models, you would realize how sketchy people can be. We just don\u2019t hear about it as much because we are not in that world. Plus, your friendship blinded you.\n\nBut it\u2019s good that you learned this lesson early and without too much fallout! Always trust your gut. Never set yourself on fire to keep other people warm. Your job is not to please everyone but to make yourself content. One day you\u2019ll look back at this and be proud of yourself.", "Also **after** she had spoken to a lawyer to see if she could force these pictures without her friend\u2019s permission.", "Whatever the number in b your head is. Double it\ud83d\ude05", "She wants you to retroactively sign a release so she can legally go on stomping the boundaries you set?\n\n\nHahaha no.\n\nI hope you've realized this woman has the moral fiber and ethical sense of a piranha.", "Honestly dont sign the release no matter the offer. Its not your issue the cropped photos dont work. She needs to do a reshoot with someone else. The agreement was no face. Its not a life changing amount that would make it worth going against all your initial instincts about everything. Also wont compensate for the week that poster was up.", "I'm sorry you've met a lot of crappy people who've taken advantage of you ... but potential allies are out there! I know it's hard to believe sometimes, but there are good people in this world who will treat you with respect and have your back. Don't give up hope on that, please!", "If the photos were that revealing and it got taken down because of complaints, as long as you wanted to work on the artistic industry/entertainment industry or modeling industry, you are fine.  But if you want to have a professional career in corporate world in the future, you might want to reconsider that even if the offer meets your expectation cuz it's totally not worth it and when it's out there it's out.\nYou never know if it's gonna to bite you in the ass one-day.\n\nPS. We all make mistake of making friends with wrong people.  It is okay.  If we are so perfect, we probably wouldn't be sent here for the journey.  Just gain the experience and move on and you learn more when you made mistakes, cheers \ud83d\ude18.", "Actress/performer here:  I'm someone who is totally okay with nudity, but to be clear:  this is a business.  Just b/c someone is a certain gender doesn't mean that they will treat you as anything other than someone they are doing business with.  That means vastly different things to different people.  Having an \"all people my gender in my industry will think just like me\" mindset is a recipe for disaster.  Decide, on your own, what type of work you want/are comfortable with and treat yourself like the owner of a small business; which is what we are.", "Talking to a lawyer was great. Please stop calling it \"Cali\" unless you're going to say you live in \"Frisco, Cali\".", "Just an FYI she's not sorry and she didn't have tunnel vision.\n\nShe tried to exploit you and thought she was in the right.\n\nShe probably bragged to her lawyer about it, just to br slapped down hard with legalise.\n\nThat's why she brought the document, not just in case, but in the hops you were dumb enough to sign it and let her get away with her sexual exploitation.\n\nYou're NTA", "I'm with you. I'm pretty sure she's not going to offer what number I have in my head, but I'm leaving myself open to being surprised. I have made other friends here who are decent people, but because it's such a little incestuous town, everyone knows everyone. I don't think anyone can be impartial.", "I'm doing to call it Cali even more now.", "Absolutely this.

Bethany took advantage of you and violated your trust in a big way. I\u2019m well aware pretty privilege is real and pervasive, but there\u2019s a ugly side to it as well.

I like your style. Grew up in San Francisco, called it Frisco sometimes. While most Californians won't call it Cali, you should, because its funny how much it makes people mad lol. I now live in a different state, and the 400 square mile area I live in has a regional pronunciation, and for the last twelve years I have intentionally refused to say it like everyone else. I just pronounce it the way it is spelled. It is jarring to them, and funny to me lol.", "I sincerely doubt OP is actually considering signing it. She probably just said that because she was mentally exhausted and didn\u2019t want to risk another round with Bethany.", "Thanks for the update! You were NOT overreacting. Your \"friend\" was sexually exploiting you and you have every right to feel betrayed and used. People are complex beings, but your friend knew what she was doing and knowingly exploited you. Please try hard not to minimize this. There was no \"misunderstanding\" and you are in no way at fault or responsible for what happened. This is 100% sexual exploitation and abuse. I'm a survivor of abuse and I want you to know that what you went through was abuse, and feeling torn up about it is okay. \n\nOne of the worst things is how victims of sexual crimes are made to feel like they were complicit. \"You said we could take photos.\" \"But you looked so good.\" In my case it was how I kept walking back into my older brother's room, willingly, and how I didn't say, \"No\". People are complex beings, and I know better than anyone that my brother was also kind and did good stuff too. But he absolutely knowingly abused me, and your \"friend\" took advantage of you. It was not a \"mistake\". \n\nPlease get help if you need it, OP. And choose whatever feels most healing for you going forward, whether that is signing the release or not. Whether that is suing or not. You're a cool human, OP. Sending lots of positive vibes your way.", "Thank you for the update!\n\nEspecially considering that the photographer still has over 200 pictures that he hasn't processed, I absolutely wouldn't sign a model release. Any standard release would allow her to do whatever she wanted with them. File it and any accompanying letter away, in case you need it. I would also keep an eye on her, lest she try to use pictures anyway. \n\nShe apologized for being tough on you? She was a bully, trying to negate and ignore your feelings to do what she felt would benefit her business. And she STILL tried to get you to let her use the photos. \n\nWhile there are certainly people out there that will try to take advantage of you and situations, there really are a lot of good people out there.

You really want to believe in the best in people, and that's wonderful... in this scenario, the person really took advantage of that trust and faith, and you were burned. \n\nI hope you're able to turn on a good movie, eat some ice cream, cry it out, and start feeling better soon.

I have a number that I would accept in my head, that way I don't have to say never, but instead exist in some Schrodinger's torture where I can think about my future kids finding mommy's high beams on the internet.", "That makes sense and it\u2019s a good policy to have! You seem like you have a very good head on your shoulders. \n\nThat said\u2026 I would advise you to say \u201cno\u201d to Bethany no matter how high the number. Not because displaying your nude body is shameful or wrong, but because **Bethany cannot be trusted**.\n\nI understand you want to see the best in your former friend, but with all due respect, Bethany\u2019s best *sucks*. She took the inch you gave and ran a goddamn marathon. If she were truly remorseful, she never would\u2019ve handed you the release when she met up with you. She\u2019d have written this off as an expensive lesson and hired someone else. But nope! She\u2019s still trying to use *you.* \n\nImagine what she\u2019ll do once she has the release. Don\u2019t expect her to honor *any* agreements with you, oral or written, because she\u2019s already proven she\u2019d rather ask forgiveness than permission, and you\u2019re well aware, you can\u2019t put the tits back in the bra.\n\nNo. Better to put your tits on the internet for free then let Bethany make another cent off you. You can tell little SorryAioliJr 20 years from now that once upon a time, Mommy was smokin\u2019 hot and some people took advantage of that. You have nothing to be ashamed of.", "OP, do NOT sign that release. You owe this woman LESS THAN NOTHING. My bet is she's being sickly sweet to get you to sign, and is in no way ACTUALLY apologetic.\n\nI'm so sorry you found yourself in this situation. I lived in Los Angeles for 10 years, and found myself screwed over by MANY people because it's SUCH a cutthroat town of people desperate to achieve their dreams at the expense of others. It literally broke my heart time and time again, believing in people just to be betrayed. I finally shifted jobs to a less competitive one because I literally couldn't deal with the backstabbing anymore.\n\nIMO no amount she could offer is worth the disrespect she has shown you at every turn. If you accept the money/offer when it comes in, that tells HER that since it worked out this time, she can continue using others in the exact same way she used you with no ultimate consequence.\n\nWhatever the amount... it's not worth it.", "You convinced me. You're getting some tit mail girl, watch out."]}
