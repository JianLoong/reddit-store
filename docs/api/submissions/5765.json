He was diagnosed with cancer early in her pregnancy with me and passed away days before I was born. My mom had my older brother who was 1 at the time and then she had me days after losing her husband. It was a lot but she was always an amazing mom and she made sure we knew our dad loved us. She shared videos of him, as well as videos he made for my brother and me. Dad named me. He wrote a letter explaining why he chose my name. He left so much behind for me and my brother and mom spent 10 years just raising us and focusing on keeping dad part of our lives. When I was 10 she started to date again and met her husband. She married him pretty quickly (7 months after knowing him). But he was nice so it was fine.\n\nThe relationship with my mom's husband has always been kind of weird. I think he thought we'd see him as our dad and equal parent to our mom. But that's not how we felt about him. To us mom was our hero and there's no one close. We also have a place left for our dad, because of how mom raised us, and it's what she and our dad wanted too. Eventually we found a groove with mom's husband and he became family but was never seen as our parent and we all get along. Mom made sure he was never a true parent in the home, but he was to be respected as an adult and that's what it was.\n\nI'm now in my 20s and engaged to my amazing fianc\u00e9. When we got engaged I knew, without even thinking about it, that mom should be walking me down the aisle and that I wanted to do a dance with her because SHE is the person who raised me to be who I am and she's the only parent I had in my life and also because she raised us with our dad's presence in our lives, and made sure he was never forgotten or erased from us. So I spoke to my mom. Told her there was nobody I would want more and she was so happy and she said yes.\n\nBut her husband is upset and has been speaking up that he would have liked to do it. That he might not be dad but he has done just as much for me as mom (which pissed mom off and they argued over his choice of words). He said people can have two so why not have him and mom. Mom asked why a man needed to be there at all. He said because she wouldn't have been asked if dad was still alive. She told him that if dad was still alive they would have raised me together and been equally eligible for the role. He then told me that he has always been good with me, and that he even accepted being seen as family but not a parent and the least he could do is get a reward for that. He told me I could have both and save hurt feelings and I'm an adult now so I should behave like one.\n\nAITA for asking just mom and not him?", "created_utc": 1672137052, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwcn88/aita_for_asking_just_my_mom_to_walk_me_down_the/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's my only living parent and the only one who raised me. But she married her husband when I was 10 and he and I had a pretty good relationship after smoothing out the bumps and stuff. He's been there and always somewhat been on the outside, because he was never given a place to parent me and my brother. I know he would have loved for us to see him as such. I could have asked him to do it with my mom and it would have made him happy. The fact I didn't and the fact I haven't knowing his feelings are hurt, might make me the asshole.

Then anyone who\u2019s close with the family should be allowed the dance too based on that criteria. His argument about your mother won\u2019t be asked if your dad is still alive is honestly another ridiculous thing. \n\nJust the fact your mom plays both the father and mother roles for you is enough reason to not ask step dad, then adding on the fact you only have a cordial relationship with him makes even more sense to ask your mom. \n\nHe should be lucky to be invited as a plus one of your mom despite the belittling behavior he display towards her till today", "NTA", "NTA and he\u2019s acting entitled.

I do wish your step-father wasn't making such a big fuss about it.  But despite the inappropriate fuss, if he has been genuinely nice to you, dependable, kind to you mom, and has done as good a job as a close adult in your life, you might want to find a way to acknowledge him at the wedding.  Because even though he isn't your dad, a man who's been in your life living in the same household since you were 10 has played a meaningful role in your life.  If this was a kind, supportive role, maybe try to overlook his carrying on and offer him some form of recognition, if that's comfortable for you.", "Nta", "NTA and good for Mom for standing up for herself. Thats a rarity here. Usually mom just goes along with stepdaddy...", "NTA. He should behave like an adult. It's extremely rude and entitled to ask for a role in someone's wedding.

It is your wedding. Although I always find it interesting that step parents are usually treated like crap. They're expected to help keep a roof over your head, food in your belly, water & electric on, defend you if needed, be nice, be gentle, treat step children equal to their own, and the second they don't they get shredded. But when they want the honor of being a parent, they're told to fuck off. Interesting.", "NTA. I understand his hurt feelings, but he is not entitled to the role. My mum had the exact same scenario.

Solo, a pet(s), sibling, another relative, friend, mother, father (both) and/or grandparent(s) etc. \n\nI've heard about a bio father supposed to be walking daughter down, but first grabs the stepfather so that they each share the walk having supported & raised her.\n\nYour mother went through devastating situations can't possibly ever imagine. She married her 1st love (husband) shared the dream which turned into joy of having her 1st child. \n\nTurned around & became pregnant then had her heart ripped to shreds discovering the love of her life would not be able to live to old age with her, nor share parenting with their children. He never was going to see his soon-to-be OP daughter.\n\nShe had to deal with a toddler at her most vulnerable emotionally & physically as he needed her care & support. When he died, she gave birth to an infant. \n\nThat's not an easy feat. I can assume she had friends/relatives to give her support & help but that's so heart wrenching. \n\nYet through the pain, she raised both of you in the best supporting manner. She gave undivided attention, love & support to each of you.\n\nRemarrying didn't shift her focus & managed to continue being a loving mom moving forward. Not only does she deserve this, it's a recognition of how much she means to you & also a connection of the man who was your father.\n\nIf hadn't stated stepfather's relationship felt 'weird', possibly that could have been a wonderful, bonded experience to have been considered. but it wasn't. \n\nIDK it's not my business, but the mother & step may not last if he intrudes in this.\n\nStepfather I think wants to be seen in the traditional father role by all at the wedding. That can be done by walking OP down the aisle.\n\nAlthough he wants that, it's not the reality & all involved in the family dynamics knows this.

Both he and your Mom could have handled it a little better, as it's no surprise his feelings are hurt. \n\nOur family is in a similar situation, except kids knew their dad.  \n\nRemember, it's easy for people to romanticize people who have died. They don't hurt us and are forever frozen as ideal in our minds. \n\nWhat your Stepdad did is much harder. He stepped up to take care of you and showed up every day in his human imperfection, and loved you despite the conditions he was given. Is that deserving of a reward? Maybe, maybe not...but if you can find a special way to honor him and include him in the wedding, he may feel better. It's a hard thing for the man who has stepped in to provide for you and raise you to not be asked to walk you down the aisle. \n\nYour Mom is the one who really surprises me.
