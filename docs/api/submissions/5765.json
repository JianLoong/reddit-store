He was diagnosed with cancer early in her pregnancy with me and passed away days before I was born. My mom had my older brother who was 1 at the time and then she had me days after losing her husband. It was a lot but she was always an amazing mom and she made sure we knew our dad loved us. She shared videos of him, as well as videos he made for my brother and me. Dad named me. He wrote a letter explaining why he chose my name. He left so much behind for me and my brother and mom spent 10 years just raising us and focusing on keeping dad part of our lives. When I was 10 she started to date again and met her husband. She married him pretty quickly (7 months after knowing him). But he was nice so it was fine.\n\nThe relationship with my mom's husband has always been kind of weird. I think he thought we'd see him as our dad and equal parent to our mom. But that's not how we felt about him. To us mom was our hero and there's no one close. We also have a place left for our dad, because of how mom raised us, and it's what she and our dad wanted too. Eventually we found a groove with mom's husband and he became family but was never seen as our parent and we all get along. Mom made sure he was never a true parent in the home, but he was to be respected as an adult and that's what it was.\n\nI'm now in my 20s and engaged to my amazing fianc\u00e9. When we got engaged I knew, without even thinking about it, that mom should be walking me down the aisle and that I wanted to do a dance with her because SHE is the person who raised me to be who I am and she's the only parent I had in my life and also because she raised us with our dad's presence in our lives, and made sure he was never forgotten or erased from us. So I spoke to my mom. Told her there was nobody I would want more and she was so happy and she said yes.\n\nBut her husband is upset and has been speaking up that he would have liked to do it. That he might not be dad but he has done just as much for me as mom (which pissed mom off and they argued over his choice of words). He said people can have two so why not have him and mom. Mom asked why a man needed to be there at all. He said because she wouldn't have been asked if dad was still alive. She told him that if dad was still alive they would have raised me together and been equally eligible for the role. He then told me that he has always been good with me, and that he even accepted being seen as family but not a parent and the least he could do is get a reward for that. He told me I could have both and save hurt feelings and I'm an adult now so I should behave like one.\n\nAITA for asking just mom and not him?", "created_utc": 1672137052, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwcn88/aita_for_asking_just_my_mom_to_walk_me_down_the/", "score": 319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I could have asked him to do it with my mom and it would have made him happy. The fact I didn't and the fact I haven't knowing his feelings are hurt, might make me the asshole.

But despite the inappropriate fuss, if he has been genuinely nice to you, dependable, kind to you mom, and has done as good a job as a close adult in your life, you might want to find a way to acknowledge him at the wedding.  Because even though he isn't your dad, a man who's been in your life living in the same household since you were 10 has played a meaningful role in your life.

When he died, she gave birth to an infant. \n\nThat's not an easy feat.

So why would it change on OP\u2019s big day?\n\nI would have sympathy if this was communicated at any point and he explained his feelings.", "So he got his hopes up, overstepped clearly defined boundaries, didn\u2019t communicate his feelings and then threw a tantrum when he wasn\u2019t asked?\n\nIt\u2019s not black and white obviously but if his feelings changed against the predefined setup, you have to have those conversations. I\u2019m struggling to have sympathy when he\u2019s just expected things to change.", "You compromise with the person you are marrying not with a man who thinks he is entitled to a role that neither person getting married wants him to have.", "They can care, sure. But something like walking down the aisle or a special dance are for those you are closest to in most cases. Like my mom who raised me and my brother and gave us a fantastic childhood and helped preserve our dad's memory. Whereas he's our mom's husband but we're not super close.", "NTA and actually maybe even NAH. It doesn\u2019t seem at all unreasonable to me that your only living parent be the one to do these things, but I gotta say it really does sound like your mom and now you and your brother kind of went aggressively on the side of \u201cyou\u2019re not and never will be a parent\u201d from the get-go, so I can see why he\u2019s a little hurt. If the situation was reversed and you had wanted a parental figure but he had spent the last 20+ years reminding you that you would never be a daughter to him and then had a birthday where he idk made a speech about how much he\u2019s enjoyed not being a father to you all these years, you\u2019d probably be a bit hurt too. Under the circumstances I think it just makes sense to do it the way you are doing it because honestly that\u2019s just the reality\u2014your mom was, is and always has been the parent\u2014but since it seems he was given no real choice, voice or chance to do so, I\u2019m not surprised that\u2019s he\u2019s hurt or that the wedding feels like salt in a wound even though you clearly don\u2019t mean any of it that way. It\u2019s tough for him that he has to suck it up, but hey, life\u2019s tough. I think he\u2019ll be an AH if he doesn\u2019t let it go, though.\n\nEdit as OP clarified there was a distinction between the stepdad being family vs. a parent.", "It was never you're not family. It was you're not a parent. Mom is parent. You can be family but that means xyz. Maybe he didn't like that but mom was very clear with him before they got married, before he moved in, before they took any big steps. She was looking for a spouse but not a co-parent and maybe he thought we would all change our stance but it's not our fault if he didn't communicate that he wouldn't be okay with not being a parent.", ">I'm an adult now so I should behave like one.\n\nHe needs to listen to his own advice.

If you choose to do it with your mom, **you've made that choice for your wedding**.\n\nIf he doesn't understand your wedding **isn't about him**, then he's the child here and then really doesn't deserve to walk you down the aisle.", ">he even accepted being seen as family but not a parent and the least he could do is get a reward for that.\n\nHis reward is being forgiven for behaving like a childish AH about this. If he keeps this up, he will undo years of accumulated goodwill.\n\nYou are NTA. He is.", "NTA. Judging from his reaction, it sounds like you made the right choice.

Maybe a *major award* a la Christmas Story leg lamp is in order.  \n\nI get his feelings are hurt, but he needs to take his own advice, grow up, and be proud that his wife was and is such an incredible parent despite everything. \n\nGood on you for choosing and sticking with your mom.

Just that he was disappointed to find out OP's hadn't changed with everything else. I'm not saying that happened, but it's a very possible (I dare say probable) development. \n\nOP's mum can't be in 2 places at once, probably has gotten sick before, probably brought her husband to the kids events, had work etc. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that he's had to take up some responsibility for the kids over the years.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, however that has been address. They consider him family, OP explicitly says that. Family would muck in and help at times. \n\nMassive difference between a family member and a father.", "Sorry about that. I went back and edited it to replace the term \"family\".\n\nYeah, from your description, it doesn't sound like he liked it and tbh, it doesn't sound like there was much room for change there. Maybe he did expect it to change, and it just didn't, which is just life sometimes. But from the description it sounds like at least part of the not-changing aspect was because there was an active push against it, first from your mom and it sounds like eventually from you and your brother. It's clear that's how you guys wanted it and it worked for you, which is great for you guys and was a strong part of your bonding together as a family. You three sound really close and I think it's sweet and appropriate that your mom walks you down the aisle and dances with you. My mom was a single mom for a long time and I might've done the same. All I'm saying is that it sounds kind of sad for your stepdad. If all three of you (you, mom, bro) were united in your desire to be a unit with one parent, would it have done much good for him to ask for more? It didn't develop organically, so it would have just been him as a stepparent pushing for something no one else appears to have wanted. He's asking for a bigger role in this moment because it's a big one and both the life-changing nature of it as well as the very public nature of it probably stir up whatever feelings he may have had about it, both as relates to public perception and his own internal feelings about it. But him even asking for a father-daughter dance has you asking the internet he's an AH or if you are. (Which, again, if he doesn't let this go, he will be.) But this is why I think it's kind of an NAH at this point. It's just a sad reality; no one can go back in time and change it, it's just a regret that he's going to have to live with. But since it sounds like you're the only \"daughter\" he's ever had or ever will, I'm not surprised that he wanted to share that moment with you or that he's sad he won't be able to. I don't think he's an AH for asking, but he also needs to accept the answer. Unfortunately (and ironically), it sounds like he was doing kind of the reverse all these years: not asking for more, and accepting the \"no\" before it was actively given. Now he's asking, and needs to accept the \"no\" now that it's been stated. Doesn't mean he's an AH for being hurt though."]}
