If so, I found him trying to use this wallet/debit card from this old man here. Him and his buddy thought it would be funny to take a wallet from this disabled man.\" If she saw it and put the pieces together, should could have came up with a punishment on her own.\n\nShe sucks, because she believes her son is better than certain actions. Kids have to learn that actions are wrong before not doing them. She believes her son is above learning.\n\nNow, son and his buddy suck because they bullied a disabled man.

Mum = enabler. Old man = victim. You = looking out for someone who couldn't look out for himself. Even the police let you go! More people need to stand up for our vulnerable older ones. If you had of said to your niece that the culprit was a teen with tattoos trying to buy booze would she have said something different??", "NTA - kids do dumb things but with parents like that, they're going to continue to do so.  If my child stole someone else's wallet, that'd be bad - but then was trying to use the money in it (via card or hard cash)?  I'd probably want them arrested.  I'd come and get them out but kids need to learn that actions have consequences, and 10 years old is old enough to know not to take things that don't belong to them.", "You should be mean to thieves.  And ask mom \"I have no right to take the wallet your little b-ard stole from someone else? You're as bad as he is\"", "NTA stupid entitled parents who think their child can do no wrong. Your child is a shit madam, get on it.", "NTA - You did catch a thief. \n\nBy the mum\u2019s reaction, you can see bad parenting right there. Oh well, I\u2019m a few years she\u2019ll visit him in jail and still think \u2018her angel is innocent\u2019.\n\nThe old couple should have pressed charges & the cops should have arrested him.\n\nAsk your niece how she would feel if he had stolen her wallet or her grandparents\u2019 wallet? Maybe being able to relate more might help her understand.", "It seems like the mom won't do anything even if she sees him doing it with her own two eyes.", "NTA as long as it really was the old mans card and you didnt hit/touch them your reaction was more than fine, i salute you", "NTA! Those wankers were old enough to steal from an Old disabled man they deserve a Hell of a lot more than Yelling! Obviously the Mom is useless at disciplining her Golden Boy! The cops should have arrested the buggers! Thank you for being kind and helping him. Your niece was wrong, and should be taught why.", "NTA. \n\nGood for you. \n\nA verbal lashing at 10 might stop them from doing a bad action again. It won't give them PTSD", "NTA what the actual??? Those 10 year olds just rolled an elderly guy with dementia for his card. \n\nWhat sort of trashy mother defends that?? Can't imagine how the kids ended up so feral at 10. \n\nThis seems crazy.

I see since mom protested too much and thinks her kid does no wrong, that is the explanation for their behavior.", "NTA. They deserved the scolding and you can see why they are on the path they are on because of the mother.", "You stood up for someone who couldn't do that on his own, likely making the old couple regain a little faith in humanity. The little assholes are at the age where they need to learn consequences.
