If so, I found him trying to use this wallet/debit card from this old man here. Him and his buddy thought it would be funny to take a wallet from this disabled man.\" If she saw it and put the pieces together, should could have came up with a punishment on her own.\n\nShe sucks, because she believes her son is better than certain actions. Kids have to learn that actions are wrong before not doing them. She believes her son is above learning.\n\nNow, son and his buddy suck because they bullied a disabled man. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!! \n\nYou had a point, but there are better ways to make it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If my child stole someone else's wallet, that'd be bad - but then was trying to use the money in it (via card or hard cash)?  I'd probably want them arrested.

Those wankers were old enough to steal from an Old disabled man they deserve a Hell of a lot more than Yelling! Obviously the Mom is useless at disciplining her Golden Boy!
