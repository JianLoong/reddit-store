She and I haven't spoken very often for the past 4 years and certainly don't have deep conversations. Due to my family continually gossiping or being judgemental I told them 15 years ago after my first boyfriend any I broke up that they wouldn't be told if I was dating someone until it was serious. To be fair, while I tried online dating for years and have my share of bad first date stories, it's never gone beyond that until this year.  \n\nI have been dating someone for over six months. Knowing that my sister was talking about getting engaged and was planning a very short (3 month) engagement, I decided to tell my family that I was in a serious relationship.  I also wanted them to meet my bf over Christmas.  I didn't want to just show up with a date to family events without letting the hosts (one of my older sisters and her family) know. \n\nI called my older sister in the morning and she was completely okay with meeting my bf. I was excited to share about him. :) that afternoon, my younger sister texted me that she could have gotten a free size 4 wedding dress from Facebook marketplace (in the city I live in) and I asked if she wanted me to pick it up for her. She said no, it wasn't really her style but it would have been fun to try on. Plus, she was waiting for the dress she'd ordered online to arrive. She then sent me a Screenshot of a size 12 wedding dress for $80 with the caption \"Here's one for you. Lol. I've tried clicking Facebook to show me less but I haven't been successful yet.\"\n\nI assumed that she'd found out from our one sister I dating so I sent back a pic of myself and my bf. While she had been immediately responding she now took 4 minutes to respond with, \"Who's that?\" I told her \"my boyfriend\". She said, \"He looks happy\".\n\nI got on the phone with her and asked if she knew I was dating. She said no, she was surprised to hear it. When I said she was rude to send a wedding dress to someone she thought was single and had been for 15 years she told me that I was the one with the problem and she had sent it to me because it was obviously too big for her and something I could actually afford. \n\nI told her congratulations on her upcoming marriage and that obviously we still have difficulty communicating with each other. We both have talked to our sisters and mom about this situation and while I know it's silly, it bothers me that I was told I was the one being rude when I called her rude for sending it. Aita?\n\nEdit- after reading the comments I think it's clear that it's not a simple issue. Some people understand why I was hurt and felt like she was rude. Some people see her side that she was trying to connect and agree that I was rude. I do try to take a step back in situations where I feel emotional. I truly appreciate every single one of you that responded. Life is complicated and emotions even more so. I don't need to know if IATA anymore because the reality is both of us have things to work on. I know I need to not take things personally and at the end of day- this is a ridiculous thing to be upset over when there are so many more truly life altering things to worry about. I'm going to just keep being happy that she's happy and move forward.", "created_utc": 1704314274, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xte4v/aita_for_telling_my_sister_it_was_rude_to_send_me/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her sister should be aware her older sister may feel sad that her younger sister is getting married first. I think the younger sister was taunting the other sister by sending a picture of a size 12 Wedding dress.
