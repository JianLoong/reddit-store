I get home from work and sleep immediately to get as much sleep as I can as I won\u2019t be able to get any rest later before working again. Get home at 8am sleep by 8:30-9:30am depending on what needs to be done in the am.  My wife has the kids (4, 5 and 10 year old boys) ready for school and drops them off. She wakes me up @1:30 as she leaves for work and I grab the kids from school. From then on I\u2019m dealing with their lunch, school work, sometimes an activity, dinner, house chores, all the kids arguments, then bedtime at 8:30pm. My wife gets home at 10 and we swap and I\u2019m off to work again. The cycle continues the next day. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel like a single parent as the kids only see their mom less than an hour a day. I see her less than hour a day. I\u2019m taking care of the kids majority of the time. While working a full time job and moonlighting on the weekends. I\u2019d love to be a stay at home dad, but that is a huge cut in our budget if I quit. Her job is more physically demanding than mine and she\u2019s tired all the time. So when I ask her for help to at least prepare lunch, or do the laundry or any other chores she starts telling me that her feet hurt or she\u2019s tired. So I end up doing majority of the house chores and taking care of the kids. \n\nMy wife made plans Saturday for Disneyland, and a fancy dinner somewhere. Sunday she had a luncheon planned and invited some friends and families of mine to. I cancelled them all. Honestly I just wanted to book a hotel room somewhere and sit by myself in peace and quiet. No kids, no wife, no responsibilities. But I felt like that would\u2019ve been an even bigger asshole move. So I just told her I just wanted to stay home lock myself in my room and play some video games. My kids gave me their Father\u2019s Day projects and I haven\u2019t even looked at them yet. I ordered pizza, ate top ramen and locked myself away in my room the entire weekend.

Is there anything you could do to change your lives so you both worked reasonable hours during the day and had less stressful hours?  Is there a less expensive area (even a different town, state, province, whatever) where you could get more affordable housing but still have comparable earnings?  Could you look for different jobs where you are?  Could one of you get some kind of training or certificate that would qualify you for better paid work?

You are constantly suffering from lack of sleep and lack of an outlet, of course you need some time to just unwind and partake in your personal hobbies once in a while.\n\nThat being said, you need to clearly communicate how you feel and what your personal needs are to your wife. It looks like maybe YTA a little bit because you initially agreed to her plans (either directly or by virtue of not making your disagreement known), only to suddenly cancel them at the end. Your work situation might simply be incompatible with this family life, and I'm thinking it's the root cause of this. You're going to crash and burn soon.", "NTA. \n\nI know that it is easier said than done, but you both should be looking for jobs with a schedule that allows for a better work life balance. This is unsustainable. You're not getting enough rest or help.

Another way to find a therapist who takes your insurance is to go on the Psych Today website and feed in your location and the name of your insurance.  You get to read what they say about themselves. Many therapists will do online treatment if you want to avoid commute time.  You can also get a list through your insurance company, but looking up each and every one of them can be pretty time intensive.(Can you tell I've been there and done that?)", "Also, I get that you don't want your kids to have to deal with poverty or with class-related issues (which Americans tend to deny exist here, but duh...).  But what about the BS of parents who are burned out and can only have the kind of relationship with each other you can cultivate in an hour a day?  Man, you haven't had the strength or the motivation to look at their Father's Day presents yet, to feel their love, to experience that pleasure together.  You've got too much on your plate.  Give yourself (and them) a break and address this please.", "Food not having flavors is a symptom of depression.    \nI know that one very well.", "Disneyland and dinner was just our little family.  Honestly, I don\u2019t know. I thought I was up for it, but this past week I\u2019ve just been more irritable and annoyed by everything. Halfway through the week I already made up in my mind that it wasn\u2019t for me. Not to mention we go all the time.", "How do I start that conversation? Because for me, that\u2019s the issue yet when I bring it up it becomes another issue.", "I understand. Hopefully you can find time for therapy and self care. I saw your comment about not knowing where to start and psychologytoday.com has a lot of resources.", "If you\u2019re going to Disneyland all the time, maybe you should shelve that and use those funds to hire someone to be with your kids from 1:30 to say 4:30 so you can get better rest. You definitely need to communicate to your wife that while her feet are hurting, your \u201csoul\u201d is hurting and you both need to support each other. If she can plan Disney and luncheon she can do the dishes or sit at the table and meal prep. A little help can go a long way.", "To start you could tell her about the things you\u2019ve already said in the post here, how you\u2019re overworked with no free time, can hardly sleep, how she took the job for her sanity but with this split your sanity is slipping. 3 - 5 hours of sleep is just incredibly unhealthy and if she\u2019s a good partner she\u2019ll care for your health. If you need help though, setting aside time for some couples counseling could assist with you getting these things off your chest in a mediated space.", "Very much appreciate that.", "Disneyland is free for us. Agree with everything else."]}
