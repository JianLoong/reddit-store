You could have intervened before things reached a head,  but you didn\u2019t", "I think this is an ESH. So many outdated stereotypes about gender coming from everyone. Women are whole people. Being strong, independent and working full time have nothing to do with the ability to have empathy and care for others. Contributions to family made by working at home are just as important as financial contributions. \n\nYour father projecting his fragile masculinity onto your girlfriend was uncalled for. Her retaliation was pretty unwise given that she'll presumably have to have an ongoing relationship with your parents. But you didn't defend her. You didn't tell your dad you were going to have an equal relationship and that women don't exist to serve men. \n\n (I'm curious why he didn't seek other kinds of employment - I mean it's possible to pay for childcare? I'm also guessing your mother probably still did a lot of the domestic labour to save his pride.

YTA big time.", "ESH\n\nYour father clearly was deflecting his anger towards his own wife at your girlfriend. It\u2019s pretty obvious. He doesn\u2019t want you getting into a similar situation as him, which is understandable. However, to assume that because your girlfriend is independent, smart, and obviously going into a lucrative career field, she won\u2019t take care of you or love you? Not his place. He can project all he wants, but not every relationship is going to end up like his. His treatment of your girlfriend was unfair and unwarranted.\n\nYour girlfriend might\u2019ve been a bit harsh in her response, but put yourself in her shoes. Her boyfriends father just said TO HER FACE that he doesn\u2019t want his son marrying someone who can take care of themselves. I\u2019d be pretty insulted too. I understand you told her not to say that she knows about the situation your parents are in, and she violated your trust by attacking your father in response, so she\u2019s an AH for that too. Yes, there are better ways to handle these things, but you cannot expect someone to simply tolerate being insulted at a family dinner. \n\nAs for you, you seem to be in a tough middle ground between your father and your girlfriend, both of which probably are vying for you to take their side in an unwinnable situation. But let\u2019s be clear: this is -your- relationship. I\u2019m aware of traditional circumstances surrounding parental approval of potential spouses; it\u2019s common everywhere. But if you truly love your girlfriend, if you felt you trusted her enough to bring her home and meet your parents, then you should also have stuck up for her when your father said what he did. Because, in a way, he also insulted you. He insulted your choice of a partner, he insulted your ability to take care of yourself, and most importantly, he projected his own frustrations onto someone who he had just welcomed into his home. That\u2019s not okay. I\u2019m not sure what you do from here, obviously this is a small moment in a much larger scene that we\u2019re all unaware of, but getting mad at your GF and not your Dad was pretty shitty.", "YTA- tell me honestly how you would react if your GFs father spoke to you the way he spoke to her???", "YTA\n\nI disagree with the fact that your gf should have kept quite.

What you just told your girlfriend is that she can't rely on you.

Your dad is wrong, from the beginning of your post, all of the way to the end.  He's wrong about his feelings towards his own marriage, and his feelings about your relationship.

With potential in-laws like that who needs enemies?", "YTA It seems like your parents are the last people that should be giving relationship advice. You are well on your way to having a relationship as dysfunctional as theirs.", "YTA. \n\nWhat your dad said was equally as hurtful to your gf as what she said to him. She's a female engineer (I'm also a female software engineer) and the amount of shit like this we have to put up with on a daily basis is astounding, and the pain she felt hearing that from someone she likely wanted to impress pushed her over the edge. You didn't stand up for her. You're never going to be able to understand what her perspective on that is, so I think it's easier for you to understand where your dad is coming from vs. where your gf is coming from. \n\nYou mentioned in your post that \"She admits she wasn\u2019t unsure if she would be a good mom until she got a dog and said he opened up motherly instincts she didn\u2019t know she had.\" I relate heavily to this, as I was very uncertain for most of my life if I could hack it as a mother, and getting a dog completely changed my mind. If my FIL said something like this to me, it would remind me of those insecurities and enforce the idea that other people don't think I can take care of people besides myself, because I'm a \"strong woman\". \n\nHopefully this helps you understand what is going on in your gf's head in that instance, and how snapping back forcefully may have been a defense mechanism rather than just a way to hurt your dad needlessly. Overall, it sounds like your family has some deeply engrained misogyny and hopefully you can be the one to work through it and break the cycle.", "YTA, your dad's misery is his own doing. Walking around on eggshells is enabling him and victimizing your gf and mother. Your dad could have changed careers, he didn't.

He isn't wallowing in self-pitty b/c he isn't the breadwinner, he is wallowing in self pitty b/c he had to contribute to the family at all. He refused to get a job, but cooking and taking care of the children is beneath him.\n\nHe was insulting your mother for making him do anything other than sit around the house all day.\n\nAnd you should probably take a deeper look into that writing career. How much did he actually write and submit to publishers? Did he keep at it or did he just stop afte a couple of rejections? What effort did he put in to becomming a better writer? Did he tey to get and entry level jobs related to publishing so he could meet people? Excuses like \"I didn't  have time b/c I was taking care of the house\" don't cut it.

When the kids reached school age, he could've helped if he desired to. He rather complain though.", "But it is?? Do you know how many female writers are STAHM? Can't count the number of author bios by female authors who were literally in the same position as OP's dad. Writing isn't a 9-5 job. It's not a job you clock in and out of and get paid by the hour. Unless you're a huge success, most writers have day jobs or kids at home or both and write in their spare time (not saying its easy, but if it's your passion you do it anyway). If OPs dad wanted to write, what was stopping him from taking an hr a day after the kids are asleep to write a page or two?", "Nope sorry my mom was a stay at home traditional Latino mom and I vowed that I wouldn\u2019t do the same thing. But there is usually at least a little while where your kids are independent and you can you know start to at least try to put that part of yourself back together if it\u2019s causing you that much pain and go to therapy and deal with your shit instead of taking it out on your son\u2018s partner which should be the opposite of what any loving parent who spent that much time with her child would want to do. Am I saying it\u2019s not hard? Na but a person like this has absolutely no excuse. PS there\u2019s tons of stay at home moms who became hit riders and shit how my mom was the first to graduate college in our family.", "Completely agree! However he had an opportunity to contribute financially when the kids reached school age/adulthood. He's blaming the world when he had ample opportunity to be an additional breadwinner (since that seems to be what he desires). He could've even hired a cleaner/cook etc with his additional income if he hated being a SAHP that much.", "I think dad wants OP to be the breadwinner and not do any cooking or cleaning, and also get in his time machine and travel back to the 50s.", "I thought the \"hate to say it\" was more out of fear of sounding like he has an Oedipus complex.", "Apparently dad also failed at parenting if OP agrees with his dad's sexist comments.", "Her boyfriend should've said something but there are also better ways to react in the moment that deflect tension instead of escalating. Eg. \"hmm, interesting. I was raised to believe that relationships should have an egalitarian division of labor.\" Disclosing what her boyfriend told her in confidence was such an overreaction.", "I just don't think what the dad said rises to the level of bullying.", "Rise above sexism? Racism? Ageism? Ableism? Any ism?\n\nNo thanks.", "Or alternatively, the person can just not be an asshole in the first place.", "Yeah but then the other person still gets away with being a rude misogynist.", "Fuck that. Responding gracefully to sexism allows it to continue.", "Why? He can make disgusting and misogynistic comments about her and her life but she has to just take the 'moral' high ground and can't stand up for herself unless it's nice and doesn't offend him? \n\nScrew that, you want to give it out, you can receive it back, return to sender.", "IKR? I self-published four novels and two nonfiction books, most of those written when I was working full time and doing the majority of child care when I was home. (With enough coffee, anything is possible.)", "He can write, he try to write. Op says that never worked, I suppose that he isn't that good or not is on the line with the market. Or is on there waiting for a super big publishing house to pick him up and published his noveless without any effort on his part.", "That sounds so cool and I want to read your books!! I love geeking out on medical stuff, and I love fantasy books, so it sounds like a win!", "Please that sounds awesome, I would like to read in the future \ud83d\ude33", "Damn I just got accepted into vet tech and I'm already 5 years into writing my first novel...fantasy as well.", "Half of all novels published in a year are by first time writers. Write one page/day, 365 days later you have a book. Book editors get raises & promotions based on new writers they find.\n\nESH, you should have defended your GF, and she should haven't blabbed something she was told in confidence.", "You don\u2019t want to be better than them?", "I agree, but we can only control how we act, I\u2019m not saying you have to put up with being spoke to rudely, but respectfully saying \u2018excuse me, I do not appreciate being spoken to like that\u2019 or something similar, defuses the situation rather than causing more problems.", "No not at all. You can tell someone they are behaving inappropriately without snapping back. By staying calm and explaining your point you have a much better chance of getting through to someone. Otherwise it just end up as a screaming match that achieves nothing.", "Yeah and then get called a \u2018crazy emotional bitch\u2019, that\u2019s really helpful.", "I\u2019m not a writer, so thanks for confirming this for me. No wonder his wife is resentful, he\u2019s moping over something he could 100% still do & blaming his wife for \u201cemasculating\u201d him, all the while still carrying the belief that women should stay at home & men should be breadwinners (while he sits on his ass after his kids graduated & left the house)", "Standing up for yourself doesn't make you \"worse.\"", "He's trapped in a marriage he hates even though he gets to live off his wife's wealth and wants his son to have a housewife. How is explaining that rationally gonna go?", "To make change, sometimes you gotta make waves \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I agree but that\u2019s not what she did. She made a rude comment about someone else\u2019s marriage rather than focusing on herself.", "That\u2019s not her problem. She can stand up for herself in a calm way, his situation doesn\u2019t need to come into it. I\u2019m not defending him at all, but when faced with hate and anger, matching it just creates more. What ever happened to the dream of fighting hate with love?", "Yep. The patriarchy isn't going to hand over equality. We have to demand it.", "From what I\u2019ve seen, people who just erratically end up having their point lost. The suffragettes got their point across by mirroring the men in their violence. But nowadays the smarter win, and so we have to be smart, methodical and clear to win.", "She turned his hypocrisy back on him. I think that's fine.\n\nNot every situation can or should be handled with kid gloves.", "Well I disagree but that\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t have the same opinion but we\u2019re still cordial to one another, that\u2019s how people should be. Thank you for your challenge, life is about being challenged."]}
