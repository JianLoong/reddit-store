I agree it was insulting but she took it too far but shooting back that at least she can make money and contribute financially to the household and not need her partner to be the breadwinner while hating them for it.

You could have intervened before things reached a head,  but you didn\u2019t", "I think this is an ESH. So many outdated stereotypes about gender coming from everyone. Women are whole people. Being strong, independent and working full time have nothing to do with the ability to have empathy and care for others. Contributions to family made by working at home are just as important as financial contributions. \n\nYour father projecting his fragile masculinity onto your girlfriend was uncalled for. Her retaliation was pretty unwise given that she'll presumably have to have an ongoing relationship with your parents. But you didn't defend her. You didn't tell your dad you were going to have an equal relationship and that women don't exist to serve men. \n\n (I'm curious why he didn't seek other kinds of employment - I mean it's possible to pay for childcare? I'm also guessing your mother probably still did a lot of the domestic labour to save his pride.

YTA big time.", "ESH\n\nYour father clearly was deflecting his anger towards his own wife at your girlfriend. It\u2019s pretty obvious. He doesn\u2019t want you getting into a similar situation as him, which is understandable. However, to assume that because your girlfriend is independent, smart, and obviously going into a lucrative career field, she won\u2019t take care of you or love you? Not his place. He can project all he wants, but not every relationship is going to end up like his. His treatment of your girlfriend was unfair and unwarranted.\n\nYour girlfriend might\u2019ve been a bit harsh in her response, but put yourself in her shoes. Her boyfriends father just said TO HER FACE that he doesn\u2019t want his son marrying someone who can take care of themselves. I\u2019d be pretty insulted too. I understand you told her not to say that she knows about the situation your parents are in, and she violated your trust by attacking your father in response, so she\u2019s an AH for that too. Yes, there are better ways to handle these things, but you cannot expect someone to simply tolerate being insulted at a family dinner. \n\nAs for you, you seem to be in a tough middle ground between your father and your girlfriend, both of which probably are vying for you to take their side in an unwinnable situation. But let\u2019s be clear: this is -your- relationship. I\u2019m aware of traditional circumstances surrounding parental approval of potential spouses; it\u2019s common everywhere. But if you truly love your girlfriend, if you felt you trusted her enough to bring her home and meet your parents, then you should also have stuck up for her when your father said what he did. Because, in a way, he also insulted you. He insulted your choice of a partner, he insulted your ability to take care of yourself, and most importantly, he projected his own frustrations onto someone who he had just welcomed into his home. That\u2019s not okay. I\u2019m not sure what you do from here, obviously this is a small moment in a much larger scene that we\u2019re all unaware of, but getting mad at your GF and not your Dad was pretty shitty.", "YTA- tell me honestly how you would react if your GFs father spoke to you the way he spoke to her???", "YTA\n\nI disagree with the fact that your gf should have kept quite.

What you just told your girlfriend is that she can't rely on you.

Your dad is wrong, from the beginning of your post, all of the way to the end.  He's wrong about his feelings towards his own marriage, and his feelings about your relationship.

With potential in-laws like that who needs enemies?", "YTA It seems like your parents are the last people that should be giving relationship advice. You are well on your way to having a relationship as dysfunctional as theirs.", "YTA. \n\nWhat your dad said was equally as hurtful to your gf as what she said to him. She's a female engineer (I'm also a female software engineer) and the amount of shit like this we have to put up with on a daily basis is astounding, and the pain she felt hearing that from someone she likely wanted to impress pushed her over the edge. You didn't stand up for her. You're never going to be able to understand what her perspective on that is, so I think it's easier for you to understand where your dad is coming from vs. where your gf is coming from. \n\nYou mentioned in your post that \"She admits she wasn\u2019t unsure if she would be a good mom until she got a dog and said he opened up motherly instincts she didn\u2019t know she had.\" I relate heavily to this, as I was very uncertain for most of my life if I could hack it as a mother, and getting a dog completely changed my mind. If my FIL said something like this to me, it would remind me of those insecurities and enforce the idea that other people don't think I can take care of people besides myself, because I'm a \"strong woman\". \n\nHopefully this helps you understand what is going on in your gf's head in that instance, and how snapping back forcefully may have been a defense mechanism rather than just a way to hurt your dad needlessly. Overall, it sounds like your family has some deeply engrained misogyny and hopefully you can be the one to work through it and break the cycle.", "YTA, your dad's misery is his own doing. Walking around on eggshells is enabling him and victimizing your gf and mother. Your dad could have changed careers, he didn't.

He isn't wallowing in self-pitty b/c he isn't the breadwinner, he is wallowing in self pitty b/c he had to contribute to the family at all. He refused to get a job, but cooking and taking care of the children is beneath him.\n\nHe was insulting your mother for making him do anything other than sit around the house all day.\n\nAnd you should probably take a deeper look into that writing career. How much did he actually write and submit to publishers? Did he keep at it or did he just stop afte a couple of rejections? What effort did he put in to becomming a better writer? Did he tey to get and entry level jobs related to publishing so he could meet people? Excuses like \"I didn't  have time b/c I was taking care of the house\" don't cut it.

Like the insecurities oozed out with that sentence", "And doesn't sound like he blames his dad", "This is true. Most writers don't decide they are going to be writers and not do any other work because a very small percentage are actually commercially successful. And they need to eat and pay rent! OPs mother did not become a success overnight and his father had lots of opportunity to become successful at something if the writing didn't pan out which it obviously didn't.  I think in a way it was a shame OP'S mother was able to support the family on her own because otherwise Dad would have been forced to accept reality in regards to his writing, and gone out and got a job that paid while writing on the side.  Instead he decided they would live on Mom's salary and he would pursue his writing.  He hasn't found success and he is blaming everyone but himself but his outcome is 100% his own, no one forced him to do anything. He needs to own his choices instead of being resentful towards who helped him with his dream.\n\nIn terms of OP'S GF, firstly, I see that OP has said what her career is in but not his, why is that? Obviously Dad is projecting all his regrets onto OP and his GF and I'm wondering if this is a repeat performance of strong career woman as breadwinner,  less career minded man as either a lower paying job or a SAHP??  Your Dad feels emasculated by your mother but again, he made the choices that got him right where he is. I think perhaps he is part of a generation and culture where men are typically the breadwinners and he feels some embarrassment for his position whereas I think men and women of today are more about equality within a relationship,  more acceptance of women taking the role of the breadwinner and men being a SAHP. I don't know if you are thinking of marriage and if you have defined the roles of how both of you can be successful and fulfilled in what you choose to do?? I can understand your GF being upset at being lectured to about what her role should be which seems to revolve around taking care of her man. It's also insulting to someone who is accomplished in their field to not get kudos for it but being told basically your job is to stay home and look after the kids and husband of course. I'm surprised that you didn't find it offensive that your Dad implied you are incapable of looking after yourself and being an involved parent to your children. After all, he has told your GF that you need someone to look after you. If it was me, I would have said respectfully  Dad, thanks for your concern  but I am very capable of taking care of myself just as both of us are capable of providing financially for ourselves. If GF wants to focus on her career then that's up to her and the same goes for me.\n\nOP, women are getting tired of being treated like \"the little lady\" in this day and age. Your GF shouldn't have to listen to your Dad's misogynistic commentary and not say anything in her defense because your Dad is resentful that your Mother had a career and supported the family because he either couldn't or didn't want to.  I'm sure no one was holding him down and saying You are NOT allowed to work; you must stay home and become a SAHP. Do you resent your mother for being the breadwinner in your family? Do you share your father's views that she should have stayed home looking after your father and the children even when he wouldn't get a steady paycheck job?? I think you need to examine your own feelings about this because perhaps you do believe women should be wives and mothers and not career-oriented. Perhaps that's why you didn't contradict your father when he insulted your GF? If you want to live in the 19th century then don't date women who are educated and accomplished.

Stephen King and Dean Koontz both we're teachers, and had wives who said to them you've got x amount of time to write, and I'll support you, and if it doesn't work well then you can get a job.", "There was just an AITA about a SAHM with 5 kids (in 10 years, iirc- my memory is shit) who was just signed for a fantasy series she's been writing, by steal 5 minutes here, 5 minutes there.\n\nPersonally even if publishing isn't ever an option for me, for whatever reason- even if the reason was I just suck at writing- I still keep at it, for me. Sometimes I feel like my head might explode if I don't get some of the ideas out, though that's obviously just my personal experience with writing. I understand getting really demoralized by the idea no one else might ever read what I write on a large scale when I was much, much younger though.", "DO IT.

This will not pay well (or sometimes at all) but it\u2019s a low stress way to start developing a portfolio. After that I took some classes online through my undergrad university\u2019s extension program, which helped me move more into essays and feature stories that I\u2019ve had published in magazines and newspapers. You can find submission info on their websites. Also at that point the blogs I\u2019d written for more than a couple times were offering me specific assignments. \n\nThat was during naps, weekends, and one day a week when my mom would come watch the kids. This is the first year they\u2019re all in full-day school, so I thought it was a good time to start writing books, which I\u2019ve always wanted to do.

How many did their work under their husband or bosses name?\n\nOPs dad is just feeling the struggle that so many females have over the centuries.  House, kids, AND pursuits is HARD.  His blindspot is not realizing how much he should appreciate women innovators and creators when it's right the fuck in front of him.  That's why dude!  This is why men are more known for discovering and inventing and creating shit.  They had the fucking time to do it!!", "Me too! I was surprised I hadn't seen it mentioned yet.", "Ironically the father wanted the benefits of his wife being a housewife, while he has already filled in that role himself, and hates it, then judges his own wife for not fulfilling the role he's hoarding and doing poorly at. Like sir, if you're here, and I'm here, then who's paying the bills?!\n\nWanting his wife to cook and clean and provide as he stays home, is so soooooooooooooooooo lame.\n\nVersus an equal household, or him being the same Powerful one with the Pants he idealizes that actually provides funds to feed his kid. Just lol.\n\nWouldn't be shocked if he was just mad his attempts at using his wife for financial abuse and having her stuck with him backfired. She's stuck with him, sure, but he's not being fanned with a leaf and fed grapes.

That's why you and your dad are trying to make her feel bad for working.", "Definitely. Your dad's life is his own, he cannot blame anyone else to make himself feel better.\n\nMy mom is a SAHP after she was forced by her in-laws (they paid for it) to get a comp sci master's degree because that's what my father studied and my grandfather thought it would be useful for his son (my dad's grades were crap until he met my mom because she was like, your dad is scary let's have our date in the library and study instead lol).\n\nShe worked for a few years in the 80s in a racist southern office where co-workers would bully her by spraying febreeze in her cubicle and laugh. To this day, my mom is super sensitive about always showering every day and smelling clean.\n\nShe became a stay home mom when my younger sister was born.\n\nHer interest was always nutrition and she used self-study to turn our family into super healthy people and brought my dad's lifelong high blood pressure down through food and exercise.\n\nShe also self-taught and day trades stocks...does well enough that she annually gets a call from someone in the bank asking her opinion on the markets. I remember when my dad was super stressed one year because my grandparents health was really bad but international flights were super expensive 2-3x a year, my mom printed out all her accounts to show exactly how much she had saved. She told him not to worry about the money and to go take care of his parents. My dad never cries, I think I've only seen him cry 2-3x. He definitely shed some tears when my mom did that for him.\n\nAnyhow, just saying that your dad is an AH and you should have said something.", "He even says he \u201chates to say\u201d his gf is like his mom.

Your father didn't need to be defended. Your father needs to take responsibility for his own actions. The current situation of his relationship started with his own refuse to change the dynamics. Your father may have been the SAHP, he was also an adult and children don't need supervision the entire time they still live at home. By the time you all went to school, he could have started working. \n\nSo your father hating your girlfriend has nothing to do with her and what she said, but with the fact that your father prefers to blame others for his current situation instead of taking responsibility. You need to realise that at the moment you are a part of the problem by allowing your father to blame others. \n\nSo OP grow up, be an adult, het your act together, take responsibility and tell your dad that he is responsible for his own situation and he can still change it. It is time for him to start acting like an adult instead of a 5 year old. \n\nPs SAHP is real hard work and a demanding job. It doesn't give anybody the right to act like a toddler the rest of their lives when the children are old enough to take care of themselves.", "& underscores boldly that OP didn't actually give his girlfriend the information she needed to possibly navigate more deftly.\n\nHe didn't say, \"My father is bitter and blames my mother/women/women w strong careers.
