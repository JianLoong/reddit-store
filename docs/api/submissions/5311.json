You could have intervened before things reached a head,  but you didn\u2019t", "I think this is an ESH. So many outdated stereotypes about gender coming from everyone. Women are whole people. Being strong, independent and working full time have nothing to do with the ability to have empathy and care for others. Contributions to family made by working at home are just as important as financial contributions. \n\nYour father projecting his fragile masculinity onto your girlfriend was uncalled for. Her retaliation was pretty unwise given that she'll presumably have to have an ongoing relationship with your parents. But you didn't defend her. You didn't tell your dad you were going to have an equal relationship and that women don't exist to serve men. \n\n (I'm curious why he didn't seek other kinds of employment - I mean it's possible to pay for childcare? I'm also guessing your mother probably still did a lot of the domestic labour to save his pride. It's a well-established pattern for unemployed men).", "So, your sorry useless father was being an ass, but she's the bad guy? Yeah, YTA just like your dad. I feel bad for your girl and for your mom.

YTA big time.", "ESH\n\nYour father clearly was deflecting his anger towards his own wife at your girlfriend. It\u2019s pretty obvious. He doesn\u2019t want you getting into a similar situation as him, which is understandable. However, to assume that because your girlfriend is independent, smart, and obviously going into a lucrative career field, she won\u2019t take care of you or love you? Not his place. He can project all he wants, but not every relationship is going to end up like his. His treatment of your girlfriend was unfair and unwarranted.\n\nYour girlfriend might\u2019ve been a bit harsh in her response, but put yourself in her shoes. Her boyfriends father just said TO HER FACE that he doesn\u2019t want his son marrying someone who can take care of themselves. I\u2019d be pretty insulted too. I understand you told her not to say that she knows about the situation your parents are in, and she violated your trust by attacking your father in response, so she\u2019s an AH for that too. Yes, there are better ways to handle these things, but you cannot expect someone to simply tolerate being insulted at a family dinner. \n\nAs for you, you seem to be in a tough middle ground between your father and your girlfriend, both of which probably are vying for you to take their side in an unwinnable situation. But let\u2019s be clear: this is -your- relationship. I\u2019m aware of traditional circumstances surrounding parental approval of potential spouses; it\u2019s common everywhere. But if you truly love your girlfriend, if you felt you trusted her enough to bring her home and meet your parents, then you should also have stuck up for her when your father said what he did. Because, in a way, he also insulted you. He insulted your choice of a partner, he insulted your ability to take care of yourself, and most importantly, he projected his own frustrations onto someone who he had just welcomed into his home. That\u2019s not okay. I\u2019m not sure what you do from here, obviously this is a small moment in a much larger scene that we\u2019re all unaware of, but getting mad at your GF and not your Dad was pretty shitty.", "YTA- tell me honestly how you would react if your GFs father spoke to you the way he spoke to her???", "YTA\n\nI disagree with the fact that your gf should have kept quite.

What you just told your girlfriend is that she can't rely on you.

Your dad is wrong, from the beginning of your post, all of the way to the end.  He's wrong about his feelings towards his own marriage, and his feelings about your relationship.

With potential in-laws like that who needs enemies?", "YTA It seems like your parents are the last people that should be giving relationship advice. You are well on your way to having a relationship as dysfunctional as theirs.", "YTA. \n\nWhat your dad said was equally as hurtful to your gf as what she said to him. She's a female engineer (I'm also a female software engineer) and the amount of shit like this we have to put up with on a daily basis is astounding, and the pain she felt hearing that from someone she likely wanted to impress pushed her over the edge. You didn't stand up for her. You're never going to be able to understand what her perspective on that is, so I think it's easier for you to understand where your dad is coming from vs. where your gf is coming from. \n\nYou mentioned in your post that \"She admits she wasn\u2019t unsure if she would be a good mom until she got a dog and said he opened up motherly instincts she didn\u2019t know she had.\" I relate heavily to this, as I was very uncertain for most of my life if I could hack it as a mother, and getting a dog completely changed my mind. If my FIL said something like this to me, it would remind me of those insecurities and enforce the idea that other people don't think I can take care of people besides myself, because I'm a \"strong woman\". \n\nHopefully this helps you understand what is going on in your gf's head in that instance, and how snapping back forcefully may have been a defense mechanism rather than just a way to hurt your dad needlessly. Overall, it sounds like your family has some deeply engrained misogyny and hopefully you can be the one to work through it and break the cycle.", "YTA, your dad's misery is his own doing. Walking around on eggshells is enabling him and victimizing your gf and mother. Your dad could have changed careers, he didn't.

He isn't wallowing in self-pitty b/c he isn't the breadwinner, he is wallowing in self pitty b/c he had to contribute to the family at all. He refused to get a job, but cooking and taking care of the children is beneath him.\n\nHe was insulting your mother for making him do anything other than sit around the house all day.\n\nAnd you should probably take a deeper look into that writing career. How much did he actually write and submit to publishers? Did he keep at it or did he just stop afte a couple of rejections? What effort did he put in to becomming a better writer? Did he tey to get and entry level jobs related to publishing so he could meet people? Excuses like \"I didn't  have time b/c I was taking care of the house\" don't cut it.

OP thinks it's a big deal but he doesn't realize that behind a woman like her girlfriend there is a line of men waiting for her girlfriend to leave him to have a chance with her.", "Agreed. Like the insecurities oozed out with that sentence", "And doesn't sound like he blames his dad", "This is true. Most writers don't decide they are going to be writers and not do any other work because a very small percentage are actually commercially successful. And they need to eat and pay rent! OPs mother did not become a success overnight and his father had lots of opportunity to become successful at something if the writing didn't pan out which it obviously didn't.  I think in a way it was a shame OP'S mother was able to support the family on her own because otherwise Dad would have been forced to accept reality in regards to his writing, and gone out and got a job that paid while writing on the side.  Instead he decided they would live on Mom's salary and he would pursue his writing.  He hasn't found success and he is blaming everyone but himself but his outcome is 100% his own, no one forced him to do anything. He needs to own his choices instead of being resentful towards who helped him with his dream.\n\nIn terms of OP'S GF, firstly, I see that OP has said what her career is in but not his, why is that? Obviously Dad is projecting all his regrets onto OP and his GF and I'm wondering if this is a repeat performance of strong career woman as breadwinner,  less career minded man as either a lower paying job or a SAHP??  Your Dad feels emasculated by your mother but again, he made the choices that got him right where he is. I think perhaps he is part of a generation and culture where men are typically the breadwinners and he feels some embarrassment for his position whereas I think men and women of today are more about equality within a relationship,  more acceptance of women taking the role of the breadwinner and men being a SAHP. I don't know if you are thinking of marriage and if you have defined the roles of how both of you can be successful and fulfilled in what you choose to do?? I can understand your GF being upset at being lectured to about what her role should be which seems to revolve around taking care of her man. It's also insulting to someone who is accomplished in their field to not get kudos for it but being told basically your job is to stay home and look after the kids and husband of course. I'm surprised that you didn't find it offensive that your Dad implied you are incapable of looking after yourself and being an involved parent to your children. After all, he has told your GF that you need someone to look after you. If it was me, I would have said respectfully  Dad, thanks for your concern  but I am very capable of taking care of myself just as both of us are capable of providing financially for ourselves. If GF wants to focus on her career then that's up to her and the same goes for me.\n\nOP, women are getting tired of being treated like \"the little lady\" in this day and age. Your GF shouldn't have to listen to your Dad's misogynistic commentary and not say anything in her defense because your Dad is resentful that your Mother had a career and supported the family because he either couldn't or didn't want to.  I'm sure no one was holding him down and saying You are NOT allowed to work; you must stay home and become a SAHP. Do you resent your mother for being the breadwinner in your family? Do you share your father's views that she should have stayed home looking after your father and the children even when he wouldn't get a steady paycheck job?? I think you need to examine your own feelings about this because perhaps you do believe women should be wives and mothers and not career-oriented. Perhaps that's why you didn't contradict your father when he insulted your GF? If you want to live in the 19th century then don't date women who are educated and accomplished.
