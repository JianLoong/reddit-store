I agree it was insulting but she took it too far but shooting back that at least she can make money and contribute financially to the household and not need her partner to be the breadwinner while hating them for it.

You could have intervened before things reached a head,  but you didn\u2019t", "I think this is an ESH. So many outdated stereotypes about gender coming from everyone. Women are whole people. Being strong, independent and working full time have nothing to do with the ability to have empathy and care for others. Contributions to family made by working at home are just as important as financial contributions. \n\nYour father projecting his fragile masculinity onto your girlfriend was uncalled for. Her retaliation was pretty unwise given that she'll presumably have to have an ongoing relationship with your parents. But you didn't defend her. You didn't tell your dad you were going to have an equal relationship and that women don't exist to serve men. \n\n (I'm curious why he didn't seek other kinds of employment - I mean it's possible to pay for childcare? I'm also guessing your mother probably still did a lot of the domestic labour to save his pride. It's a well-established pattern for unemployed men).", "So, your sorry useless father was being an ass, but she's the bad guy? Yeah, YTA just like your dad. I feel bad for your girl and for your mom.

YTA big time.", "ESH\n\nYour father clearly was deflecting his anger towards his own wife at your girlfriend. It\u2019s pretty obvious. He doesn\u2019t want you getting into a similar situation as him, which is understandable. However, to assume that because your girlfriend is independent, smart, and obviously going into a lucrative career field, she won\u2019t take care of you or love you? Not his place. He can project all he wants, but not every relationship is going to end up like his. His treatment of your girlfriend was unfair and unwarranted.\n\nYour girlfriend might\u2019ve been a bit harsh in her response, but put yourself in her shoes. Her boyfriends father just said TO HER FACE that he doesn\u2019t want his son marrying someone who can take care of themselves. I\u2019d be pretty insulted too. I understand you told her not to say that she knows about the situation your parents are in, and she violated your trust by attacking your father in response, so she\u2019s an AH for that too. Yes, there are better ways to handle these things, but you cannot expect someone to simply tolerate being insulted at a family dinner. \n\nAs for you, you seem to be in a tough middle ground between your father and your girlfriend, both of which probably are vying for you to take their side in an unwinnable situation. But let\u2019s be clear: this is -your- relationship. I\u2019m aware of traditional circumstances surrounding parental approval of potential spouses; it\u2019s common everywhere. But if you truly love your girlfriend, if you felt you trusted her enough to bring her home and meet your parents, then you should also have stuck up for her when your father said what he did. Because, in a way, he also insulted you. He insulted your choice of a partner, he insulted your ability to take care of yourself, and most importantly, he projected his own frustrations onto someone who he had just welcomed into his home. That\u2019s not okay. I\u2019m not sure what you do from here, obviously this is a small moment in a much larger scene that we\u2019re all unaware of, but getting mad at your GF and not your Dad was pretty shitty.", "YTA- tell me honestly how you would react if your GFs father spoke to you the way he spoke to her???", "YTA\n\nI disagree with the fact that your gf should have kept quite.

What you just told your girlfriend is that she can't rely on you.  And you just told her that you agree with your dad, that she should be the meek woman who doesn't stand up for herself, and who's only goal should be to take care of her husband.  Your dad is wrong, from the beginning of your post, all of the way to the end.  He's wrong about his feelings towards his own marriage, and his feelings about your relationship.
