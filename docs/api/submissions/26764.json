They also have candles directly under it. They light candles for the twins birthday and Indie's anniversary.\n\nMy sister gave birth to her first child back May and she named her daughter Indie. I'll confess that I have been unable to look at it as some beautiful tribute because it's difficult to hear the name used for another little girl in the family other than my Indie. But I have kept that to myself.\n\nNow a few months on my sister is bothered by the fact our parents kept Indie's memorial up when her Indie will see it whenever she's there. She said it's very morbid and seems gross to do to her daughter who will grow up feeling very weird with her name on a memorial at her grandparents like that. My parents told her she should have thought of that before she named her daughter Indie. My sister was like \"OP doesn't own that name and I should be allowed to use a name I love\".\n\nWhen our parents didn't give in to her demands she came to me. She told me it bothers her and she knows it will bother her daughter in years to come. She wanted me to tell our parents to take down the memorial. I refused to entertain her idea. She pushed and I told her I did not want my daughter's memory tucked away forever. My sister yelled and told me that my Indie is gone and there's a living, breathing Indie who deserves to feel comfortable at her grandparents house. I told my sister to get the fuck out of my face.\n\nMy sister said I was a total ahole for putting the memory of Indie before her Indie. She also said it will only confuse my son in the future when his twin's tribute becomes messed up in his only maternal cousin.

She would tell her daughter about her beautiful namesake. \n\nAdditionally, your sister seems to be projecting her own feelings onto her daughter.

Obviously NTA.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry for your loss. Your incredible strength to get up every day is admirable, let alone not cutting off your sister for her gross move of using your beloved Angel daughter's name. I think the memorial reminds her that she did something out of bad intentions and that she has to face her own behavior. Hopefully one day feels especially embarrassed because your parents back the memorial and she's realizing her daughter will see that memorial, figure out what their mom did and she'll have no explanation on why she was so cold to use the name.

Firstly, I think it's cruel to have named her daughter the same as your late baby girl.

So you don't need to hide your Indie to appease her either.", "NTA-  first of all if she spun using your child\u2019s name as some tribute she was lying it seems from the blatant disrespect she has shown your daughter\u2019s memory in general and right to your face.  I was appalled when you said she named her baby Indy and it only got worse through the rest of your post.  \n\nYou should express your feelings about the name thing if you want, that is upsetting and sounds like something my sister would do who I don\u2019t speak to anymore. It looks like a beautiful tribute so you feel obligated to take your feelings and stuff them, but the act is designed to hurt you and silence you all while being confusing enough that no one can say for sure it\u2019s as messed up as it feels.

Your sister though\u2026,Wow.", "NTA \n\nSmall kids accept whatever you tell them I doubt your sister's kid will be all that confused or uncomfortable when they explain to her that there was once a cousin of the same name and that the memorial plaque thing is for her. \nIt's not that difficult to understand. \n\nLots of families re-use the same names especially in Europe and no one stops doing mourning related things because of it. We didn't suddenly remove all mentions of Isabel (grandma) when Isabel (little sister) was born but just explained to her when we mentioned another Isabel that she used to have a grandma with that name. Easy as that. \n\nIt's by no means guaranteed that she'll feel uncomfortable about it. \nThe kid might even think its cool to have a connection to the family's past history or find it touching that they keep this memorial to never forget her cousin and be impressed that the grandparents made it themselves. Maybe her response to seeing it will be to ask them to teach her woodworking.\n\n\nAnd I mean your sisters kid will probably get to grow up and be in many photographs etc. Its unfair to want to take away one if the few mementos of your kid.", "What the actual fuck?\n\nI mean, I guess if your sister gave her kid the middle name indie it would be a tribute....\n\n... but actually naming her kid the same as your deceased child's???

The fact that she named her child that you had the composure to not react to that is amazing, to me, but for her to have the nerve to now demand that everyone forget about your Indie is disgusting and appalling. I love that your parents are on your side of this, if they weren't this whole situation would be even worse. Your sister needs to deal with the fact she stole your babies name and not make it all about her. In regards to her complaints about it confusing her daughter and your son... well, not if the family members have the brains to explain to them that this baby existed and this is how your family chose to remember her.
