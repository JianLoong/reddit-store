My sister yelled and told me that my Indie is gone and there's a living, breathing Indie who deserves to feel comfortable at her grandparents house. I told my sister to get the fuck out of my face.\n\nMy sister said I was a total ahole for putting the memory of Indie before her Indie.

Your incredible strength to get up every day is admirable, let alone not cutting off your sister for her gross move of using your beloved Angel daughter's name.

Hopefully one day feels especially embarrassed because your parents back the memorial and she's realizing her daughter will see that memorial, figure out what their mom did and she'll have no explanation on why she was so cold to use the name.

Firstly, I think it's cruel to have named her daughter the same as your late baby girl.

I was appalled when you said she named her baby Indy and it only got worse through the rest of your post.  \n\nYou should express your feelings about the name thing if you want, that is upsetting and sounds like something my sister would do who I don\u2019t speak to anymore. It looks like a beautiful tribute so you feel obligated to take your feelings and stuff them, but the act is designed to hurt you and silence you all while being confusing enough that no one can say for sure it\u2019s as messed up as it feels.

Easy as that. \n\nIt's by no means guaranteed that she'll feel uncomfortable about it. \nThe kid might even think its cool to have a connection to the family's past history or find it touching that they keep this memorial to never forget her cousin and be impressed that the grandparents made it themselves.

The fact that she named her child that you had the composure to not react to that is amazing, to me, but for her to have the nerve to now demand that everyone forget about your Indie is disgusting and appalling. I love that your parents are on your side of this, if they weren't this whole situation would be even worse. Your sister needs to deal with the fact she stole your babies name and not make it all about her. In regards to her complaints about it confusing her daughter and your son... well, not if the family members have the brains to explain to them that this baby existed and this is how your family chose to remember her.

The sister is a HUGE a-hole, and I really pity her daughter growing up realising what an itchB her mother is.", "I should have said this previously but I am sorry for your loss.\n\nThe next questions really are for you to thinkl aobut for yourself no need to answer or response. What was your sisters relationship like with your Indie, what is your relationship like with your sister, what is your sisters relationship like in general with the family.\n\nI ask because I wander if she is trying to replace your indie as part of her grieving or the overall family grieving and wanting them to move forward or is it about getting that attention and being a bit self centred or feeling a certain way. It would be kind of bad still but honestly I do not get why your sister has done what she has done.\n\nYour fathers reaction was perfect, as was yours with regards to it messing his cousin up, ask her how it might mess your niece up to know she was named after her dead cousin to try and replace her because her mom did not want anyone to remember your Indie anymore or mourn her passing. Betting she wont like that very much and it will lead to a bigger argument and fight.\n\nAlso just as a thing you do not own the name, and there are going to be other Indies out there some of whom may become family, so far you have been very understanding to your sister and your niece. Once more I am sorry for your loss. You will always be Indies mom, she will always be your parents grand daughter and nothing will ever change that or take that away.\n\nThis is an example but not the real names hereThe name John  is very common in my family with 4 members of the family all sharing it, (it is named after a grandparent,2 of my relatives also have the same surname) my own parents even wanted me to be named John but after my father but in my case it was changed to Johnson so it was known I was named after my father.\n\nThe only way it will mess up her daughter or the family is how you all treat it. A name is a name, Indie was your daughters name, it is now your nieces name, they are 2 very different people and it is possible to respect and love them both seperately.\n\nShe tried to erase your daughter and lay ownership over the name, you did not, she is the TA not you.", "That's possible.  It seems to me that she lacked the imagination to picture that two Indies might exist in other people's minds. Either because she's totally self-absorbed or a bit intellectually-challenged, or both.", "Absolutely. The fact that OP was able to keep her anger to herself about her sister using that name is mind-blowing. It feels like this sister is used to stepping over boundaries, and everyone else in the family has to just smile and nod because dealing with her shit would be way more painful. What an insufferable brat.", "I had a picture of my grandmother before she passed up in my old house (moved and haven't been able to put it back up yet). It's not weird or uncommon to have pictures up of loved ones that have passed.\n\nEdit: typo", "Having photos of loved ones who have passed is not weird, I\u2019ve been to a lot of homes where that is the case. But having a literal memorial, with vigil candles and everything sounds really weird to me; I\u2019m not personally familiar with anyone who\u2019s family does that, and I have close friends from pretty much every major religion who are quite spiritual.", "Yes, I know what grief is. I went through it with all my grandparents, both my parents, very close relatives, and several close friends. And I was distraught, and in a few cases inconsolable for a while. I cry for missing my dad several times a year, and he passed almost 25 years ago.   So I\u2019ve been through it many times. But keeping a constant reminder of that grief does not help in the recovery from it.", "I think sister named her kid this as the parents gave too much attention to OP, and now she wants to replace Indie with another one and wipe out the first one so the focus will be on her.\n\nWhat will actually happen is one day her daughter is going to realise she has the name of her dead cousin and her mother is not a nice person\u2026\u2026..", "Also strikes me as profoundly unlucky, but I'm one of those toss-salt-over-the-shoulder types.  Like, tribute names should come from a relative who lived a long, successful life.  Or the great-grandpa you're trying to butter up for a better inheritance.", "It's also definitely not a tribute when she whips out the \"you don't own the name\" bullshit. What a nasty piece of work the sister is.", "My sister didn't really have a relationship with my Indie. She has seen photos but only my husband and I got to be with her because of the time she was born and where she was staying in the hospital. \n\nMy sister and I are not very close and never really were. She is close to our parents. Closer to our brother than me but he and I are very close.", "She can be a bit self-absorbed. But I never would have expected her to be this thoughtless about it either.", "And when the girl insists on being called something else, as soon as she is old enough to do so, the mom will play the victim again some more, and blame her family for \"turning her child against her\", \"tealing her child from her\", \"making\" her child hate her name, etc.", "Oh, it\u2019s definitely *not* a tribute name. If it was, then the sister wouldn\u2019t have any problems about having the memorial up and she definitely wouldn\u2019t say  \"OP doesn't own that name and I should be allowed to use a name I love\u201d. Also, if it had been for a tribute and not to be vicious and hurt OP, she would have asked OP and used the name for a middle name.\n\nThe sister sounds like a narcissist that absolutely hates when she\u2019s not the focus of attention, and she\u2019s not above using her daughter for this.\n\nI already feel bad for the daughter and I really hope she doesn\u2019t turn out to be like her mother.\n\nOh, and NTA!", "Yeah, if it was a tribute name it would be easy to explain \u201cthis is in memorial for the girl you were named after, your cousin Indie.\u201d A child with an honor name will know about the person they are named after. Instead, she\u2019s doing the opposite of honoring her, she\u2019s trying to wipe out her memory entirely."]}
