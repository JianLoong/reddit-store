Your mom is right - there IS a compromise here: Your brother helps. He can come the day/night before and help you prepare the food or early the day of and help you set up or stay late and pick up.

If you're using so much of it that it becomes the flavor you're doing it wrong.

Olive oil can work if no affordable vegan butters/margarines are available", "This is the way.", "This will probably sound crazy to you, but my brother has issues with milk and I make my mashed potatoes with mayonnaise instead (Duke's is the best if you can get it).

If this was an allergy, or something significant like religious reasons, and the guest had an invite, sure, make a dish to suit their needs.

They treat it like it's expected that you'll make a special effort and you're an AH if you dont.

Like I said, and I don't think I explained well, I'm agreeing with you, but it just sounds like they're really mad that the brother never brings anything but haven't actually had a conversation with the guy about it. A potluck of 40 and everybody bringing something sounds like a ton of food; maybe there's always a shit ton of leftover and bro doesn't want to contribute to all that waste. Maybe he's assuming with that many people he can not and slide under the radar, which clearly isn't working. But when I've got people with dietary restrictions coming to my house for a holiday I always make sure there's something they can eat, because that's what a good host does.

However, the level of snide entitlement your brother is showing would really piss me off, if he'd been apologetic and willing to offer help,it would have gone a long way in making the request more accommodating.
