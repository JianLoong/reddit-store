Because that's apparently the group we are envisioning here.", "My god, it's not science. It'll be fine. It's literally one of the easiest dishes out there", "It's. An ingredient. If you're using so much of it that it becomes the flavor you're doing it wrong. Are your mashed potatoes butter flavored?\nI feel like if you're making food for 40 people (and not for the first time by the sound of it), you're probably comfortable making small adjustments like \"use one simple substitute of almost the same ingredient\" on the fly. If not, you're going to be googling recipes beforehand anyway, in which case, you can just make that part of the research.", "I don't but I love eating the skins. In fact, I have a hard time not just baking them and eating them plain.", "My work always gets a tofurkey for our Thanksgiving potluck for the vegetarians, but none of us ever eat it because it's gross! Those of us who are veg always bring real food that doesn't have meat in it, which are enjoyed by everyone whether they like meat or not \ud83e\udd23 Like I appreciate them trying to be inclusive , really I do, but it's so not necessary!", "Exactly.", "To be fair, that's not all that much worse than turkey.", "You're braver than me I took one look and said no thanks I'll just eat veg when we where planning Christmas Dinner we now use a quorn roast which I enjoy and can eat it hot or cold once cooked", "I fucking love the Tofurkey orb! It's my favorite thing at Thanksgiving.", "Lifelong vegetarian here too. There are so many varieties of vegetarian seasonal substitutes now, but my vegetarian family won\u2019t allow me to get anything else \ud83d\ude02. Tofurky is just engrained tradition now.", "I used to work at whole foods back before Amazon bought them. We sold Field roast celebration roast during the holidays and it was pretty damn good cause it wasn't trying to be turkey and it is made with real food. Oh yeah and I am a steak and potatoes meat is tasty tasty murder kinda person", "The best was when Quorn made little turkey loafs. I don\u2019t think they make them anymore, or maybe I just can\u2019t find them anymore, but those were the shit.", "This is a great add to pasta sauce or chili. Also a can of pumpkin.", "I have used it, and I was impressed as well.  I also like the Impossible Italian sausage.", "Yes, I love that meat alternatives are catching on mainstream! We eat impossible beef in our tacos and I think I\u2019ve started to prefer it. We\u2019re not vegetarian, but I\u2019m a big believer in everyone eating less meat even if you can\u2019t/wont go full vegetarian or vegan.", "It's funny to me that you said \"pretty damn killer\" since most meat substitute items are loaded with chemicals and other fillers that are not good for you.", "I'm just pointing out people attacking the vegan are out of line. She's not an asshole just because she's a vegan. The brother is the asshole", "Just FYI, a lot of margarines are not vegan/dairy free. Olive oil can work if no affordable vegan butters/margarines are available", "This is the way.", "This will probably sound crazy to you, but my brother has issues with milk and I make my mashed potatoes with mayonnaise instead (Duke's is the best if you can get it). It has butter in it too, which my brother can have with no issues but if you can't margarine would probably work. The first time I made them he absolutely loved them and it's the only way I make them now.", "Imperial is not vegan. Check ingredients", "I just looked up three common brands off the top of my head - land o lakes, great value, imperial, and all 3 have dairy in them. I don't know if \"majority\" would be close to true, and even if it is over 50%, you should definitely look at the ingredients before putting it into food and serving it to a vegan or someone with a milk allergy.\n\nAnd no, if it were by definition, they likely wouldn't be able to sell it as margarine per FDA standards. Like how many \"ice creams\" actually aren't labeled as ice cream because their fat/cream content isn't high enough, and they have to label them as frozen treat or whatever.", "I'm in this kinda like esh feeling. Like op is clearly harboring serious resentment towards the brother but it doesn't appear that they've communicated to the brother that there's an issue, so from the brothers position I can understand why he'd be pissed. Also, like, \"hosting\" something to me implies the cooking part, unless clearly explicated that it's gonna be a potluck? But the brothers also an ah for name calling instead of just making his own damn potatoes, it's not like it's hard", "Bold of you to assume he doesn\u2019t \ud83d\ude02", "Macadamia and cashew milks are much creamier than almond and don't alter flavors as much. I do like hazelnut milk, but it was getting expensive for a while. Oat milk works as well.\n\nI could see adding coconut milk/cream to the squash - nice option!", "Yeah, but I don't use it and don't want it hanging around afterwards. I can make do with what's on hand, as can many others. That was my point, that OP probably had things around that could make it work.", "I was taking about \"the good stuff.\" Margarine is fine for some uses but not all.", "country crock is basically plastic, or tastes like it anyway", "It is though. People can choose their food preferences, and not everyone is part of a religion at first, they can choose to join. And a lot of vegans actually want to help the environment, and be more compassionate towards animals, trying to get us a better life.", "How is a religion better just because the person's parents told them it's right or because lots of people follow it?\n\n(In any case, lots of people follow veganism...)\n\nAt least veganism isn't based on completely unsubstantiated beliefs. And no, I'm not a vegan, but I would accommodate one if I was hosting them", "Seems like she would be the only vegan. People would be bringing things they already know the rest of the guests would like, regardless of if the dish is vegan or not. To expect them to change their dishes at the last minute for someone that the host didn't even invite isn't cool.", "Yes, because it\u2019s not feasible for one person (op) to do so for all of them. It is much easier if they bring something specific for their own dietary requirements, such as allergies.", "They\u2019re expecting a traditional recipe they\u2019ve had time and time again. Why would OP go out of her way, for an uninvited guest? Vegan mashed potatoes are not delicious, merely mediocre. Especially if using coconut oil. I have a cousin who\u2019s vegan and several friends. When we eat at their home, we bring dishes we enjoy, and vice versa. If this was an allergy, or something significant like religious reasons, and the guest had an invite, sure, make a dish to suit their needs. But being vegan 4/5 times, is a personal choice, and tagging along versus being invited, should not expect anyone to cater to their \u201cneeds\u201d.", "I have never eaten vegan butter nor used margarine to make it. I don\u2019t know how it will taste. I\u2019m not saying the science will be off, but maybe vegan butter doesn\u2019t taste good in everyone\u2019s opinion. Maybe OP will learn she doesn\u2019t like the taste and then has to commit to it?", "The best mashed potatoes have a LOT of butter.", "Yep, the thought is nice, but that's about it. I'll stick to sides myself.", "It\u2019s not gross but you have to cook it right and use the orange juice/soy sauce glaze.", "Turkey is not gelatinous though?", "I tried it when I was kid back in the nineties when there weren't really many options. It was more of a novelty than anything, a disgusting novelty.", "I put it on Pizza.", "There\u2019s a place near me that does impossible beef empanadas that are better than their regular beef ones.", "Long as it is fully announced, so some of us can skip the soy based stuff?  Ok..\n\nPlenty of people are allergic to soy.  I don\u2019t care to use an epipen if I don\u2019t absolutely Have to.", "Why tho? I honestly almost only eat meat and would rather die then quit. My dad went almost vegan but for health reasons but I'm the healthiest one if my family by a long shot and maybe get sick once every few years and that's with kids in school. Also growing up playing sports competitions it's not even an option to be vegan and competing at the highest level. Cant even consume enough protein without eating 24hrs straight", "This actually makes a lot of sense! Creamy? Yup. Plenty of fat? Yup. What's not to like? I can see it working out really well. I might have to set some potatoes aside next time and make a tiny portion to try it out!", "It's stated in the original post that she hosts, and provides turkey & mashed potatoes for 40 people, and that it's understood that it's pot luck, and everyone is expected to bring a dish. Bro demanded the gf be invited, then demanded OP make vegan potatoes for her, and then called her a bitch when she said no. Not sure how that's an everyone sucks situation. Sounds like the brother is an entitled asshole.", "And they can do all that stuff and that's fine. But as soon as they want others to make extra effort on their behalf, it's not just about them and their own choice anymore. And frankly, most of them in my experience don't treat it as a situation where they should thank you for doing them a favor when you change your plans for them. They treat it like it's expected that you'll make a special effort and you're an AH if you dont. No thanks to all of that.\n\nAlso, you can be born into a religion and relatively fewer make the choice to join one later. You can't be born a vegan, and ALL of them make the choice to join.", ">How is a religion better just because the person's parents told them it's right or because lots of people follow it?\n\nHaving a decision made for you as a child and then not changing it  ... is a somewhat more sympathetic situation than just making a bad decision on your own as an adult.", "That's a lot of work for the word \"maybe\" when on the other hand, the vegan guest CERTAINLY won't be able to eat the potatoes (or, I would guess, most other dishes that day) if they're made with dairy.", "Ok? Maybe if you have a specific dietary requirement for mashed potatoes to have butter, you could bring your own.", "One of my veg coworkers is from Pakistan, and she hooks it UP for potlucks. I usually make a pot of red beans and rice, so we actually do pretty good, if we can keep enough away from the not-veg ppl!", "Might be better if it were.", "Still tastes terrible.", "I only looked at it and new it was going to be \ud83e\udee3", "There are vegan Olympic athletes.", "You can be a vegan athlete, gotta love stuff like tofu and lentils though.", "I hope you like it!", "Ah, I missed the part where the potluck part was stated that it was expected, not just people bringing things to be polite, and that the gf wasnt invited; I'd assume significant others of siblings are de facto accounted for. Like I said, and I don't think I explained well, I'm agreeing with you, but it just sounds like they're really mad that the brother never brings anything but haven't actually had a conversation with the guy about it. A potluck of 40 and everybody bringing something sounds like a ton of food; maybe there's always a shit ton of leftover and bro doesn't want to contribute to all that waste. Maybe he's assuming with that many people he can not and slide under the radar, which clearly isn't working. But when I've got people with dietary restrictions coming to my house for a holiday I always make sure there's something they can eat, because that's what a good host does. If my brother reached out and said \"hey, my gf is coming to family thanksgiving this year and she's vegan, can you make sure she can at least eat like mashed potatoes or something\" I'd just make all the mashed potatoes with margarine and call it a day.", "Again, you are stereotyping. Have you ever actually met a vegan? Is your view just based on the Vegan Teacher?", "Why can\u2019t her brother make them? Why is it on her? And why do 39 other people have to eat vegan mashed potatoes for one person?", "Oh, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not a simple as replacing the butter with some other ingredient. Because a lot of mashed potato recipes use a ton of butter and if you just replace that with for example coconut oil it would not be great.", "I personally like turkey, but yes the flavor profile is similar. The texture is way, way different though. So different. Inedibly different", "You are very wise!", "lol, have I ever met a vegan. Many more than I would have liked to. And no, it's not stereotyping when it's true.", "I refer you back to my original comment: Brother should absolutely do his share of the holiday chores. However, the person who agrees to cook a certain share of a meal is usually expected to cook it so that EVERYONE can eat from it.\nAnd to answer your last question: because it makes no damn difference to them. Source: I'm a non-vegan who's cooked and eaten many vegan dishes.", "\"men are more violent than women\"- stereotype, even though in a lot of cases is true\n\n\"Vegans try and force their views on you\"- stereotype, even though in a lot of cases is true", "I didn\u2019t mention anything about him doing holiday chores. Only that he should prepare the dish for his girlfriend as it is a potluck style dinner. If he wants a certain type of potatoes, he can make them. \n\nSource: I made my own mashed potatoes for Holiday dinners when I was dairy free. And I SURVIVED!"]}
