My daughter said that she does sometimes feel like my wife excludes her slightly or treats her different from her brother. She did also mention how sometimes my in-laws aren't nice to her and make comments about her not fitting in and just general comments that made her feel unwelcome. She told me she was scared to tell me in case I would be angry at her. I've apologised to her for not realising how my in-laws were treating her and for making her scared to talk to me.\n\nMy wife pretty much confirmed what my daughter said. I'm so disgusted and fucking annoyed at her. I don't understand how any could treat a fucking child this way. She's the sweetest little girl she has never done anything to deserve this I just don't understand how they can be so disgusting and fucking cruel.\n\nWe're planning on getting a divorce and my wife is planning on moving out after Christmas. The divorce will hopefully be easy since we've agreed on split custody for my son. Once she moves out she'll have my son every weekend but that'll probably change once she gets her own house. I am very grateful that she's being so nice about all of this there's not been many arguments about the divorce which is very helpful.\n\nThank you for all of the comments on my last post!!", "created_utc": 1702992878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m20gw/update_aita_for_bringing_my_daughter_to_my_inlaws/", "score": 3106, "replies": ["I think you are a terrific father and I'm sure your daughter will remain close to you throughout her life.

My father and mother got married very young (my mom was 19) after my paternal grandfather died. My mom got pregnant with my sister while my dad was an officer in the army. Officer life was hard on my mom, and they ended up divorcing for about 8 years. I am lucky to exist and for them to have remarried because my dad was an asshole for those 8 years.\n\nHe swore to my mother that he would always take care of my sister. Just ask, and he would get whatever she needed, so on and so forth. My mother had known him her whole life. She trusted him completely, so at the divorce hearing, she told the judge she needed no alimony and no child support because my dad said he would always take care of both of them. The judge told her she could request no alimony, but she WOULD take 50 dollars child support as a precaution. He had heard this sort of thing before, and if she didn't take child support, she couldn't ask for it if the worst should happen.\n\nMy mother never saw a dime more than that 50 dollars a month, and my grandfather had to repeatedly threaten my dad with going back to court to get more child support during emergencies to get him to help with even medical procedures for my sister.\n\nJust because it seems amicable now, do not trust your soon to be ex-wife. Make sure you have everything in writing. Make sure if she promises something. It's in print because she may, in fact, change her mind.", "Wow, so sorry this situation turned out this way, but let me just say.... THANK YOU for being such a fantastic parent. So many posts you see, and so many people in real life choose to be with a spouse that mistreats a step child (my own mother stayed with her husband for 17 years despite him mistreating me and me hating him, she never once chose me over him). The fact that you prioritized your child speak volumes, so good on you. Your daughter will be forever grateful.", "I\u2019m so happy you are standing by your daughter. I am so sorry this had to lead to divorce, but I\u2019m concerned with how blas\u00e9 your wife is acting about it all.", "Holy shit I'm sorry, thanks for taking the time to keep us updated, I'm sorry to here it went that way, but unfortunately not surprised. Good luck.", "I hate how spot on everything from the last post turned out to be, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re protecting your daughter.\n\nSide note: I would make sure she gets some therapy and knows this is not because of her, it\u2019s because of your wife and her family\u2019s meanness (you don\u2019t have to say it like that, but \u201cit\u2019s a grownup thing\u201d). She sounds like she\u2019s already internalizing stuff and is worried about upsetting you, so I would find a way to make sure she knows she\u2019s not to blame for anything. Also beware later if the ex\u2019s family tries to drive a wedge between the siblings by blaming the sister for \u201cbreaking up the family.\u201d \n\nTruly, these people suck.

That's harsh.", "It seems to me that this marriage was not a stable one for awhile as the choice to divorce appears the best solution to all. Good luck and hopefully your daughter (and son) has a better relationship with the women in your life.", "Take her to court for full custody of son. No reason for him to be there when you have proof of how she will react when her future husband inevitably sidelines your son over his own children.

Her only taking him on weekends could be her telling people you only let her see him on the weekends. Withholding your son from her. That could go badly for you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re putting your daughter first. Good luck with the divorce.", "That is so wrong! She married you I assume because she loved you. To truly love someone, you love all of them. Did she not realize by marrying you, you and your daughter are a packaged deal? She needed to accept that and so did her family. You are making the right choice to stick by your daughter's side. I'm sorry you'll have to split custody with your son, but that  is better than living in a home with parents that don't get along or resent each other. \n\nUnsolicited advice warning: don't accept custody where you get weekdays and no weekends. That means mom gets the fun days while you get work days and homework monitoring. It might be better to do every other week where you get a weekend and the week then mom gets a weekend and a week.", "Glad to hear it. I hope you go through with it because your wife and her family sound like horrible, toxic people. You and your daughter deserve better.

It's pretty normal for kids to worry about telling parents unpleasant things, just in general, and even more so for a child to worry that if she told her father something unpleasant about his wife that he would blame her. Children are naturally self-centred . . . not in a selfish way, but because they are the centre of their own universe.

She's never had a feeling of longing like she will every evening that she doesn't get to ask her son how his day was and to say goodnight. And because mom and her family are human colostomy bags, they will never even think about how this is affecting the boy. They'll only ever acknowledge how much the situation hurts them. Or, if they do acknowledge the pain the child is feeling, it will only be when their using it as a weapon against the father. \n\nHer disgusting treatment of her stepdaughter will now create irreparable pain for her son for his entire childhood. He, too, will miss countless family gatherings. He'll go through life feeling like he has a foot in two different worlds because he's now going to have live in a world where traditional language doesn't even work for him. For instance, there's no way of getting around referring to the two different homes as \"mom's house\" and \"dad's house.\" He's never going to get a family photo that doesn't feel forced and awkward every time he sees it. While dealing with all of those emotions, he very likely will have to learn how to deal with a blended family at some point. Mom could marry the most wonderful stepfather in the world who's family welcomes both mother and son with open arms and despite how much better that makes her feel, her son will still have a hole in his heart. \n\nKids are resilient little fuckers, though. Both kids will get through this, especially if dad keeps up the good work. To the dad, you're in for a pain you've never felt before since you've not experienced shared custody yet. But, if you continue to support your children like you just did with your daughter, they'll know what love feels like. They need to know you're their champion, and you will always have their back.
