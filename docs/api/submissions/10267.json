Show up for your wife and daughter the best you can right now.", "NAH. This was horrible timing for everyone. I understand your decision, and I understand why your wife is upset. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and I hope your family is able to move on from this.", "NTA - if you helped bring your brother peace as he passed. Sorry for your loss", "Nta. Damn you're brother died but they expected you to just leave him to die alone, when clearly your wife had at least her mother there? And after they found out he died they still didn't care? Wow", "This is the worst movie script ever.", "NTA.\n\nA birth of a child is an amazing, important time; but, god willing, that child will be there for many years to come. \n\nDon\u2019t blame yourself for choosing your brother over it, it was the correct choice.

It\u2018s normal for her to feel like this is where you should have been.\n\nTruth is: You have a whole life to make it up to her and your baby doesn\u2018t even know who is present during their birth.\n\nYour brother doesn\u2018t want to die alone. \n\nSure - the fear of birth and the fear of birth may be very similar. But one of them is in most cases survivable and she hopefully had her mother present while the other is 100%ly deadly. \n\nMaybe one day she will learn to see past her self-centred view (which, again, is during her current situation rather normal) and understand how losing someone forever is something else than welcoming someone in life that you still have a lot of time to spend time with later.", "NTA\nYou did what you had to do. It was tough. I have two younger brothers and I can't imagine what it's like to lose one of them even though one already almost died.

This was, however, your only chance to say goodbye to your brother. I don\u2019t think your wife is an AH for being upset, childbirth is intense, emotional and she\u2019s full of hormones. Understandably she would\u2019ve wanted you to be there. I do think your MIL could\u2019ve been a bit more understanding.", "NTA. But let me say this. Ultimately you chose your brother over your wife and newborn child. That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but it certainly shows where you priorities lie.\nYou should go home and be with your wife and baby. You weren\u2019t there when she needed you and you need to be there for them now. It won\u2019t change what happened, but actions and effort matter.", "Info: Very real question.

Your wife needs you there, no matter what she may say. I'm so sorry for your loss. It's a devastating blow to you and your family and your in laws need to understand that.

While I understand why your wife is mad if I was in the same situation I would choose to spend time with my brother as well. He had limited time but your wife will have all the time in the world to spend with you ( if this doesn\u2019t end up in divorce ).", "Hopefully your wife comes to her senses after the stress of delivering a child to understand that your last moments with your brother outweigh the birth of your child. NTA. Your MIL also needs to be told to keep out of you and your wife's disagreement.", "INFO I feel like we\u2019re missing A LOT of details here. How far along was your wife in labor when you left? Have you communicated to her that this scenario was a possibility, and what you would do should it happen? How long were you with your brother for? Did you leave your wife alone to be with your brother? \n\nIn all honesty I\u2019m leaning towards NAH. For obvious reasons I understand why you\u2019d be by your brother\u2019s side on his deathbed, that\u2019s a no brainer there. \n\nHowever, what hasn\u2019t been discussed yet as if writing this is the very real possibility of labor complications. Your wife and child could have died, and you may not have been there. It\u2019s not thought about a lot anymore, but here in the US maternal mortality rates are still unusually high.\nYour wife was probably (and understandingly) scared and in the worst pain imaginable, and you not being there + angry mom probably didn\u2019t help her stress. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to call your wife an AH here unless you\u2019ve discussed this scenario at length beforehand. You wouldn\u2019t be an AH for going to your brother, you\u2019d be an AH however, if you didn\u2019t communicate with your wife.", "NAH", "INFO. What was the communication and discussion with your wife like before you made a decision?\n\nCurrently NTA as it's an incredibly difficult decision in either case but I view it as one life leaving the world forever, and another is a new life coming in to be there for the future. The main issue is likely that your wife wanted support. If you couldn't be there, discussions should have been had, and potential alternatives could have been broached (e.g. Family members for support). How close you were with your brother would also factor in. Everyone has different views on where blood relatives are WRT importance.", "NAH. I don't think I could forgive a partner for this, even knowing the truth. It's just *such* a vulnerable moment to be left all alone, the moment when perhaps you need your partner most... I really empathize with your wife. This was an impossible situation all around and I can see both sides.", "NAH your brother died, I'm sorry. Your wife and/or child could have easily died as well at any moment. It's a very, very scary thing to go through by yourself, but thankfully it seems it all went well for them. You were stuck between two impossible choices, but in the end you got to be with your brother before he passed. \n\nBe gentle with your wife. Even if everything went exactly as she wanted, her hormones would still be insane and she'd still be in a ton of pain. Everything feels out of control to her right now, she will be upset. Not having you there on top of everything else is even more upsetting. I'm going to be honest, this will likely be a sore spot in your relationship for a long while. Don't try and convince her you did the right thing, just be there for her 100% now and give her all the support you can.", "This was an impossible decision. Whatever you'd end up doing, it would have not been free of guilt. NAH your brother was dying and your wife needed support. You can only be in one place at a time.\n\nSorry for your loss and congrats for your baby. Which now shares her birthday with your brother's death. Oh jesus, I'm so so sorry...", "NAH. It\u2019s a hard choice to make. I\u2019m so sorry about your brother. That aside, your wife has the right to be upset cos she went through a very painful, scary situation without you there. But yeah, it\u2019s an impossible choice to make. Hopefully you both can move past this", "NTA. What an impossible situation. But until about 30 years ago fathers were not expected to be at the birth, my own father wasn't. And my husband missed one of our kids' births because he was caught in traffic. We all survived and I didn't miss him that much! \n\nSo, I feel your wife and MIL should have been a little more sympathetic that your brother was dying and it definitely wasn't acceptable for MIL to shout at you while you'd been through that and were grieving. Your wife is OK, the baby is OK and they need to let this go so you can all support each other.", "YTA. You knew this was a possibility but hadn\u2019t discussed with your wife what would you should do if you were in this position. If you\u2019d made her part of the decision you wouldn\u2019t be in this situation", "YTA because your wife was going through a medical procedure that can change rapidly and as her next of kin you are the person who has to answer questions about what to do- if something had happened and they couldn\u2019t reach you the consequences could have been deadly.  Giving birth can be scary, you need your partner there with you.", "YTA. A hard choice but you chose wrong. Sorry for your loss.\n\nAlthough I have a hard time believing that anyone going through this much devastation and relationship upheaval at the moment is overly concerned about what Reddit has to say about it.", "YTA.

He needed to be there for his wife and child during this time.", "I am married for 6 years", "i was calling my wife every fifteen minutes prior to going into labour then i tried my MIL who declined my calls", "18", "True, but you also don't get to sit with them when it comes to that as they are whisked away by an army of hospital staff.", "So he should have left his brother to die alone?", "This is the plot of like every terrible daytime soap opera at least once a year", "Not necessarily, but it\u2019s pretty hard to call the wife an AH. NAH mean no AHs, op wasn\u2019t an AH to go to his brother, and wife was understandably upset.", "Yes", "Impossible situation for him by the sounds of his replies - she's threatening him with never seeing her/the child again if he doesn't leave her alone for a bit.", "She kicked him out.", "If the mum who\u2019s just had to go through labour alone doesn\u2019t want him there, he should not force his presence on her", "Yes because giving birth alone isn\u2019t an incredibly terrifying situation that would leave you upset and angry along with the hormones from giving birth", "You know what, I agree. This is ridiculous, maybe you should reconsider your relationship with your wife. If her and her family cannot understand that this was the last time you were going to see your brother, then they\u2019re the assholes. She\u2019s fine, the baby is fine. I understand that she wanted you by her side but obviously this was an extenuating circumstance and it\u2019s ridiculous that this is so big of an issue that you cannot even be with your child. Sorry to be harsh but she needs to grow the hell up. Take this time away to truly reflect on what is happening and if this is what you really want in a partner.", "Using the words henpecked, selfish, entitled and drama queen to describe a woman who just gave birth, which can be deadly, is pretty shitty, and we don't even know how the labor went for mom or baby, it could have been touch and go.\n\nShe is hormonal and went through a terrifying event and needs time. He was in an awful situation but the new mom isn't some villain here.", "Why wouldn't they be home yet? It's common for parents to take home their newborn within 24-48 hours. My youngest daughter was born in the early hours and we were allowed to take her home in the evening of the same day.", "Definitely update us and try to get her to agree to counseling because she is full of hormones and went through something traumatic but so did you and hopefully she can see that with some time", "How will she prevent you from seeing your child ever again? You are her parent just as your wife is. Don't let them scare you away and don't let them feel guilty for staying with your dying brother. Billions of women have given birth without their partners. It's a luxury not necessity. You wanted to be with her but something more important prevented you. She wasn't left on the streets to give birth. She had all medical support she needed.", "I'm gonna assume your wife is not normally like this and has mil in her ear.  Get to your wife and daughter and kick everyone else out. She cant keep you away from your child only you can do that", "Please keep us updated. We'd like to know if things work out", "Doctor to patient - \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re not going to last much longer\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t happen.", "Yeah likewise cause most of us know how long it takes for labour to happen etc and for someone to die it could be quick and even assisted it will take hours so we are missing bits", "Holy shit y'all are actually insane or what ? Yes, his wife needed him and who tf cares if the brother is gone, the brother probably wanted his bro he knew all his life by his side, you don't know how much a sibling relationship can mean to someone, not only probably OP's brother needed that, but OP's needed that too, so what OP's absolutely need to be by his wife's side but OP can go fuck himself when he need to see his brother ONE LAST TIME to say goodbye ??? We're talking about someone dying, about someone he's never gonna see again, someone he was probably really close to if he made that choice, someone he knew all his life, etc and y'all are here being pissy about what if scenarios when obviously everything went well for his wife.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nY'all got no empathy I swear to god or y'all don't know what having a good relationship with some family members is like, if his wife can't support this choice just because of what if scenarios after the hormonal period is up then they're a no fit, obviously the wife is right to be angry and sad about this, but if she hold a grudge because of that, that's fucked up. I mean we're talking about a 19yo sibling death ffs, y'all got sociopathic tendencies Istg.", "What if is an assumption. \n\nHis brother died in his hands. He needs his baby's touch right now more than anyone.", "Bruh you're heartless. Stop making excuses, she had her whole family there and they can call him to get an answer. Clearly his MIL called to let him know that he missed his first born. How the hell is he supposed to leave his dying brother. You keep talking about the wife with no mention about his brother, clearly you don't give a shit about that", "So your self inserting instead of judging the actual post?", "First of all he can be there for his wife and child now, while he can't be with his brother. Also as I understand the story the brother went to the hospital first and the MC Made a promise to him that he'll be there till the end. Imagine If he had left how would his brother have felt during his last moments. Lastly about something happening during delivery, literally just any choice he would have made would be bad/wrong but because nothing happened the choice he made was the better one.", "thank you, these thoughts have been going through my head but i\u2019d live with a lot more regrets if i wasn\u2019t there for my brother", "How long was the labour", "Prior means before. Prior to graduating would have made you 15.", "The math just isn't mathing OP \ud83d\ude05", "Sorry, new app. Wasn't responding to you.", "Nevermind saw his last comment", "[deleted]", "Wow, that\u2019s unfortunate.   But the longer it goes on the worse it will get.", "In reading other comments and OP responses, I'm actually starting to think the MIL is the real problem here. I think she never really liked OP and is using this as a wedge between OP and his wife.", "From friends and family I've spoken to most with their first take quite a while and others not so much. Unless there are medical issues where you are racing to the hospital like I did to my mother and if thats the case then hmmm", "If the wife wants space, OP should respect that right now. Obviously, his presence isn\u2019t a necessity.", "He should kick out the person who was actually there to support his wife? Yeah, no. THAT would make him TA.", "...you do realize doctors can say the patient has only abt XY time left?", "If the brother was all alone & OP was the only one then it could\u2019ve", "I mean I\u2019m 99% sure this whole thing is nonsense but I still want the (imaginary) details lol", "He had plenty of time to say goodbye, his parents could be there, pathetic choice and I stand by it. Hope your partner/future partner understands where they come on your priority list.", "Well I think medical reasons they need permission etc if things went up in the air so to speak on whether they can operate etc and they wouldn't have that", "Too bad he didn't choose baby over his brother then", "Babies are not healing devices to be applied to people in need, they are very small, hugely inarticulate people with needs of their own. No one \"needs\" a baby's touch, or gets preferential access because they've been through shit.

Thankfully your wife and kid are okay don\u2019t worry about what others say.", "You're brother doesn't care either way now, your wife will live with this abandonment for years", "You sound confident in your decision. Good luck moving forward with your life\u2026either fixing your marriage or coming up with a good custody plan for baby!\n\nAnd my condolences on the loss of your brother.", "Posts are hard when you make them up.", "He's just using \"prior\" instead of \"post\". Mix up of words as opposed to a maths error", "No worries - would definitely have been a good thing to include alongside the original comment of him staying away from home", "No, it's in his replies, which is why I said \"by the sound of his replies\"", "I'd definitely still go home and look after the kid, but might be smart to prepare a lawyer in case she does try to prevent access to the child.", "I've got 2 daughters, my oldest was home the day after the birth. As long as there are no health concerns (for mother or baby) and baby has started feeding, then they're more than happy for baby to be taken home.", "It is to his baby. And him. A child is not a tool for punishing spouses", "Of course. But people in their literal last hours are almost never lucid/well enough for these types of discussions. These discussions take place with family while the patient is sedated and kept comfortable. It\u2019s 100x more likely that the \u201cus\u201d in the scenario would be OP and his parents, not OP and the brother.", "You don\u2019t think his parents being there is the more likely scenario of it being \u201cus\u201d especially considering the age? You don\u2019t think if he was actually truly all alone OP wouldnt have mentioned that critical detail in the OP?", "Hope your partner/future partner understand you don\u2019t care about them grieving in their own way lmfao", "And yes babies are good for healing.

Y'all are grown enough to type on a keyboard, you can deal.\n\nI love babies. I think they are every one of them darlings. But they - especially newborns - are not a reliable source of pleasant feelings. I have seen all I ever want to see of adults wanting to cuddle the baby while the baby fusses to be fed or changed, and of adults acting hurt and offended because an infant isn't all smiles and sunshine when they are present. Newborns are tiny, fragile people experiencing an entirely new environment and entirely new sensations all the time. Their behavior is not predictable and not always pleasant, and that's fine. They need what they need when they need it, adults need to be there for them, not the other way around.\n\nWould holding his newborn help the OP feel better? Maybe. Is that a reason for him to hold his newborn? No. Because a newborn is not a device for the care of adults. If he happens to feel better, I think that's a sweet side effect, but it can't be the goal.", "Probably better to reply with this to the person questioning him instead", "How did he die? That's a good question to solve this"]}
