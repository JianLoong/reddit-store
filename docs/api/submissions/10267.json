Show up for your wife and daughter the best you can right now.", "NAH. This was horrible timing for everyone. I understand your decision, and I understand why your wife is upset. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and I hope your family is able to move on from this.", "NTA - if you helped bring your brother peace as he passed. Sorry for your loss", "Nta. Damn you're brother died but they expected you to just leave him to die alone, when clearly your wife had at least her mother there? And after they found out he died they still didn't care? Wow", "This is the worst movie script ever.", "NTA.\n\nA birth of a child is an amazing, important time; but, god willing, that child will be there for many years to come. \n\nDon\u2019t blame yourself for choosing your brother over it, it was the correct choice.

It\u2018s normal for her to feel like this is where you should have been.\n\nTruth is: You have a whole life to make it up to her and your baby doesn\u2018t even know who is present during their birth.\n\nYour brother doesn\u2018t want to die alone. \n\nSure - the fear of birth and the fear of birth may be very similar. But one of them is in most cases survivable and she hopefully had her mother present while the other is 100%ly deadly. \n\nMaybe one day she will learn to see past her self-centred view (which, again, is during her current situation rather normal) and understand how losing someone forever is something else than welcoming someone in life that you still have a lot of time to spend time with later.", "NTA\nYou did what you had to do. It was tough. I have two younger brothers and I can't imagine what it's like to lose one of them even though one already almost died.

This was, however, your only chance to say goodbye to your brother. I don\u2019t think your wife is an AH for being upset, childbirth is intense, emotional and she\u2019s full of hormones. Understandably she would\u2019ve wanted you to be there. I do think your MIL could\u2019ve been a bit more understanding.", "NTA. But let me say this. Ultimately you chose your brother over your wife and newborn child. That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but it certainly shows where you priorities lie.\nYou should go home and be with your wife and baby. You weren\u2019t there when she needed you and you need to be there for them now. It won\u2019t change what happened, but actions and effort matter.", "Info: Very real question.

Your wife needs you there, no matter what she may say. I'm so sorry for your loss. It's a devastating blow to you and your family and your in laws need to understand that.

While I understand why your wife is mad if I was in the same situation I would choose to spend time with my brother as well. He had limited time but your wife will have all the time in the world to spend with you ( if this doesn\u2019t end up in divorce ).", "Hopefully your wife comes to her senses after the stress of delivering a child to understand that your last moments with your brother outweigh the birth of your child. NTA. Your MIL also needs to be told to keep out of you and your wife's disagreement.", "INFO I feel like we\u2019re missing A LOT of details here. How far along was your wife in labor when you left? Have you communicated to her that this scenario was a possibility, and what you would do should it happen? How long were you with your brother for? Did you leave your wife alone to be with your brother? \n\nIn all honesty I\u2019m leaning towards NAH. For obvious reasons I understand why you\u2019d be by your brother\u2019s side on his deathbed, that\u2019s a no brainer there. \n\nHowever, what hasn\u2019t been discussed yet as if writing this is the very real possibility of labor complications. Your wife and child could have died, and you may not have been there. It\u2019s not thought about a lot anymore, but here in the US maternal mortality rates are still unusually high.\nYour wife was probably (and understandingly) scared and in the worst pain imaginable, and you not being there + angry mom probably didn\u2019t help her stress. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to call your wife an AH here unless you\u2019ve discussed this scenario at length beforehand. You wouldn\u2019t be an AH for going to your brother, you\u2019d be an AH however, if you didn\u2019t communicate with your wife.", "NAH", "INFO. What was the communication and discussion with your wife like before you made a decision?\n\nCurrently NTA as it's an incredibly difficult decision in either case but I view it as one life leaving the world forever, and another is a new life coming in to be there for the future. The main issue is likely that your wife wanted support. If you couldn't be there, discussions should have been had, and potential alternatives could have been broached (e.g. Family members for support). How close you were with your brother would also factor in. Everyone has different views on where blood relatives are WRT importance.", "NAH. I don't think I could forgive a partner for this, even knowing the truth. It's just *such* a vulnerable moment to be left all alone, the moment when perhaps you need your partner most... I really empathize with your wife. This was an impossible situation all around and I can see both sides.", "NAH your brother died, I'm sorry. Your wife and/or child could have easily died as well at any moment. It's a very, very scary thing to go through by yourself, but thankfully it seems it all went well for them. You were stuck between two impossible choices, but in the end you got to be with your brother before he passed. \n\nBe gentle with your wife. Even if everything went exactly as she wanted, her hormones would still be insane and she'd still be in a ton of pain. Everything feels out of control to her right now, she will be upset. Not having you there on top of everything else is even more upsetting. I'm going to be honest, this will likely be a sore spot in your relationship for a long while. Don't try and convince her you did the right thing, just be there for her 100% now and give her all the support you can.", "This was an impossible decision. Whatever you'd end up doing, it would have not been free of guilt. NAH your brother was dying and your wife needed support. You can only be in one place at a time.\n\nSorry for your loss and congrats for your baby. Which now shares her birthday with your brother's death. Oh jesus, I'm so so sorry...", "NAH. It\u2019s a hard choice to make. I\u2019m so sorry about your brother. That aside, your wife has the right to be upset cos she went through a very painful, scary situation without you there. But yeah, it\u2019s an impossible choice to make. Hopefully you both can move past this", "NTA. What an impossible situation. But until about 30 years ago fathers were not expected to be at the birth, my own father wasn't. And my husband missed one of our kids' births because he was caught in traffic. We all survived and I didn't miss him that much! \n\nSo, I feel your wife and MIL should have been a little more sympathetic that your brother was dying and it definitely wasn't acceptable for MIL to shout at you while you'd been through that and were grieving. Your wife is OK, the baby is OK and they need to let this go so you can all support each other.", "YTA. You knew this was a possibility but hadn\u2019t discussed with your wife what would you should do if you were in this position. If you\u2019d made her part of the decision you wouldn\u2019t be in this situation", "YTA because your wife was going through a medical procedure that can change rapidly and as her next of kin you are the person who has to answer questions about what to do- if something had happened and they couldn\u2019t reach you the consequences could have been deadly.  Giving birth can be scary, you need your partner there with you.", "YTA. A hard choice but you chose wrong. Sorry for your loss.\n\nAlthough I have a hard time believing that anyone going through this much devastation and relationship upheaval at the moment is overly concerned about what Reddit has to say about it.", "YTA.
