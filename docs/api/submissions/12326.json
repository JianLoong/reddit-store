Nobody said she had to down the wine there and then! It was a very thoughtful gift. What did your girlfriend think?", "NTA and they are absolutely incorrect too recent research shows that it\u2019s safe and drinking a moderate amount is the same as drinking orange juice when it comes to breastmilk safety the actual concern when it comes to breastfeeding and drinking is safely handling the baby that\u2019s the actual concern plus there is also apps like drink safe specifically made for breastfeeding mums but the whole no alcohol what so ever while breastfeeding is absolutely medically and scientifically incorrect, as long as she can continue safe practices and handling of the baby or another adult is there it\u2019s absolutely fine to have a few glasses of wine", "NTA. Idk how her parents saw the gift or why... but a bit of advice when dealing with \"in-law\" types; the less they know, the less they can use against you. Keep as much private as possible.", "I think you are very thoughtful and it also sounds like you are very present  as a parent.   I do have to say you didn\u2019t \u201cget your girlfriend pregnant.\u201d You are both adults who decided to have a child.  Ignore the parents, you were so sweet to notice the intricacies of her condition.", "NTA There are many ways to drink responsibly after having a baby. Your gifts sound thoughtful and generous, and your girlfriend\u2019s parents sound like assholes. They should be supporting both of you as you navigate through this massive upheaval, not criticizing your kind gestures. Support your girlfriend, take care of your new beeb and don\u2019t let the bastards get you down.", "NTA\n\nI think this is really sweet. The CDC says that there is no known harm associated with nursing mothers having a drink (which they clarify as one standard drink, not more) and your girlfriend doesn't even need to drink it right away. Most importantly, her parents need to realize she can make decisions about her own body and the two of you will be making parenting decisions. It's simply not up to them.", "NTA. It's not uncommon to gift new parents some bubbly after the birth. I don't think anyone is expecting her to down it in one right there and then. Her parents need to stay in their lane. Something tells me they're going to be all in your business now that there's a Grandchild.", "Careful OP, these guys sound like the overbearing type. Be sure to assert boundaries. \n\nNTA. Did they think their daughter was just going to neck the whole thing immediately? SMH.", "My wife had a glass of champagne the moment we got home. The parents are just finding excuses to be annoyed with you. NTA.", "Nta, who cares what her parents think, the gift isn't for them", "NTA this was sweet and thoughtful, if she missed it and enjoys it it\u2019s fine to gift it to her. Her parents just seem like they don\u2019t like you lol", "NTA\n\n\nHer parents are very judgemental and emotional about this. It is a thoughtful gift. No one said she should get black out drunk or live of expresso. Moderation and timing is always the key.", "NAH - that's a very thoughtful gift basket!", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her parents are idiots.  Unless she has a drinking problem it's fine.  Best time to have a glass of wine would be right after she nurses, so her body processes the alcohol before the next nursing.  In case they made you concerned.", "NTA", "Alcohol and caffeine can get into milk (hours after ingestion) and then takes even longer to be broken down...

That's a lovely, thoughtful gift and not even close to inappropriate on any level.", "NTA. That is thoughtful to gift her those items. A sealed bottle of wine will be there and ready for her when she is ready for a glass. Her parents most likely won't be pleased with you for awhile. They should realize their daughter was equally responsible for making a baby.", "NTA. You put effort and thought into that basket to show her how much you appreciated her sacrifice.

It's a bottle of wine, not a bottle of milk! I was gifted a two-glass mini bottle of champagne when my son was born, I ended up drinking it for my wedding anniversary ten months later.
