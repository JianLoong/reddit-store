The percentage that makes it into breast milk is an every smaller percentage of what makes it into the blood stream.

Right after I had my second baby, the afterpains during nursing (cramps from the uterus shrinking back down) made me tense up all over in fear because the feeling was so similar to early labor. It was a reaction that had nothing to do with the thinking part of the brain and couldn\u2019t be reasoned away. A small amount of alcohol (about a wine glass of cider with an alcohol content similar to beer - I\u2019m a lightweight) tamped down the feeling enough to let me get past the first hour or so of nursing. I didn\u2019t drink while nursing after that, not a regular drinker at any time.", "NTA, that's a lovely gift!\n\nAnd it's fine to have a glass of wine while breastfeeding.

Even if she doesn\u2019t drink the wine for a couple of months while she\u2019s on a tighter feeding schedule it\u2019s still sweet that you have recognised the sacrifices she has made while carrying your baby and want her to have the treats she enjoys back. Sounds like her parents have other issues that have nothing to do with the basket.", "NTA it sounds like the gift as a whole served it's purpose of making your girlfriend happy and giving her some treats to show she's cared about and appreciated. It's a bottle of wine, even if you or your girlfriend were concerned about even low-moderate alcohol consumption while breastfeeding, the bottle will last until your baby is weaned, but also most research suggests there would be no ill effects on the baby if your wife enjoyed the bottle over several days. \n\nIt sounds like you're a caring, thoughtful and supportive partner, seems like her parents have just decided to dislike you and the things you do from the get go and are looking for reasons to be mad.

It\u2019s a sweet gesture in my book.", "NAH. The intention was positive but all of it was inappropriate for a new mother, and you do sound a bit immature.

Give it another nine months and things will feel more normal.", "NTA.\nNo one told her to finish that bottle of booze right away, right? Nope, great gift.\n\nHer parents are partly right about alcohol and breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, it is better not to drink alcohol. If you do want to drink alcohol, you must wait three hours per glass of alcohol before breastfeeding again. For example, if you have drunk three glasses, you have to wait 9 hours. Do you express breast milk during this time? Then throw it away.\nAlcohol also passes into breast milk through the blood. If your baby ingests alcohol, it is harmful and can cause problems.\n\nBut it's a verry thoughtful gift!", "I had champagne whilst still in hospital. Supplied by the hospital.

Also pumping and dumping isn\u2019t recommended anymore either only really if you are on specific unsafe medications.", "Oh nice! I would accept you as a Son in law.

The general rule of them is I remember is drink alcohol preferably right after breast feeding to maximize time before the next feeding, but also unless you are quite tipsy going on drunk, like the amount that is going into to the breast milk is incredibly small. You\u2019re NOT about to harm your baby off you have a glass or two of wine 2-3 hours before you feed again. Double bonus if she decides to pump breast milk at some point and it makes her uncomfortable she could pump and dump that particular batch if she is producing extra.\n\nI\u2019m not however really shocked that an older couple may not know this.

That's their loss, and now that they have a grandchild they need to get over themselves and accept that you, your girlfriend, and you baby are a family.

First thing I did, out of the hospital was go get sushi takeaway. Rare steak. Lying on my back. Boiling hot showers.\n\nShe can't drink coffee or alcohol with abandon yet, but they keep.

It's an enormous amount of pressure on the new mom. Breast feeding pressure was worse for me than pregnancy and delivery.", "NTA. Seems like the parents just don\u2019t like you.

CDC (America) states moderate amounts of alcohol is not known to be harmful. However, it also states that the alcohol level in breastmilk is essentially the same level as in the mother's bloodstream.

They say to give the baby alcohol free breastmilk.\n\n2. Your partner is an adult and can choose to make her own decisions. That being said, I've also blasted someone for being \"tipsy\" while pregnant. I personally think ANY levels of alcohol are unacceptable to a baby and their developing brain.\n\n3. Grandparents are concerned for the welfare of your grandchild because of alcohol it would consume through breastmilk. How can you be upset that they have the best interest of your grandchild at heart?\n\nYou mentioned you did research but didn't say what the research said. I personally think your wife should plan ahead and give the baby alcohol free breastmilk. Why anyone would justify giving babies alcohol is beyond me, and that is what happens when you drink and breastfeed.", "NTA, but it is true that you do have to be concerned and careful about some of these things. I'm not going to say what your girlfriend can and can't eat because I don't know for sure, but I'd recommend checking with her doctor first to be safe. Even if you find online that everything is fine, your girlfriend likely won't feel safe about it with her parents saying it's not safe, but hearing from the doctor what is and isn't okay will help put her mind at ease.\n\nWorst comes to worst, the non-perishable items like the coffee and alcohol can always be put up for a bit later.", "NTA!

Her parents are uninformed. \n\nYour girlfriend can absolutely have a glass of wine while breastfeeding. Have a glass, wait 2 hours or so, and then the milk is fine. She wouldn\u2019t even have to pump and dump. She could even pump before having the drink, just in case baby needs milk, if that makes you guys feel better.\n\nDon\u2019t let grandparents shame you guys.

The gift was for your girlfriend, not her parents.  It was thoughtful of you, so please don\u2019t let their comments bother you.

Food surprises in my experience are always welcome especially sushi and coffee!", "NTA, you already know they don't like you so of course they would say *something* regardless.

Of course and understandably everyone dotes over the new bundle of joy but I think for Mommy to get something special is super sweet. Don\u2019t feel bad about it!", "NTA. Like said above, having one drink will not cause harm to her breast milk. She could also dump that pump or save the wine. I think it was very nice of you.", "NTA as a mom I can say it's a lovely thing to do,  it's not like she would go off the rails and binge the lot that night.

To add to that - your gf can decide for herself is she wants to drink that bottle now or a year from now, it's not going to go bad if it remains unopened.\n\nYour gift was thoughtful and I hope well received by the only person whose opinion matters.

By the time you had enough Alcohol in your blood stream to actually effect the baby you'd be dead. Id compare it to throwing a shot of vodka in a kiddie pool, fruit juice has more alcohol in it than breast milk. The big risk of drinking and nursing comes from the risk of dropping the baby because you're tipsy. A stout beer actually can help stimulate milk production at first. So many people have the old-school pump and dump method in their brains and there's no reason to do that at all. It's a waste of milk.", "Why not during?

The highest concentrations they were able to record in babies was equivalent to the BAC of kids who had consumed fruit juice.
