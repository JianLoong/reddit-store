Idk how her parents saw the gift or why... but a bit of advice when dealing with \"in-law\" types; the less they know, the less they can use against you.

I do have to say you didn\u2019t \u201cget your girlfriend pregnant.\u201d You are both adults who decided to have a child.  Ignore the parents, you were so sweet to notice the intricacies of her condition.", "NTA There are many ways to drink responsibly after having a baby. Your gifts sound thoughtful and generous, and your girlfriend\u2019s parents sound like assholes. They should be supporting both of you as you navigate through this massive upheaval, not criticizing your kind gestures. Support your girlfriend, take care of your new beeb and don\u2019t let the bastards get you down.", "NTA\n\nI think this is really sweet. The CDC says that there is no known harm associated with nursing mothers having a drink (which they clarify as one standard drink, not more) and your girlfriend doesn't even need to drink it right away. Most importantly, her parents need to realize she can make decisions about her own body and the two of you will be making parenting decisions. It's simply not up to them.", "NTA. It's not uncommon to gift new parents some bubbly after the birth. I don't think anyone is expecting her to down it in one right there and then. Her parents need to stay in their lane. Something tells me they're going to be all in your business now that there's a Grandchild.", "Careful OP, these guys sound like the overbearing type. Be sure to assert boundaries. \n\nNTA.

Her parents are idiots.  Unless she has a drinking problem it's fine.  Best time to have a glass of wine would be right after she nurses, so her body processes the alcohol before the next nursing.  In case they made you concerned.", "NTA", "Alcohol and caffeine can get into milk (hours after ingestion) and then takes even longer to be broken down... And in the meantime the little one likely wants a drink. \n\nNot really that thoughtful imo when the mother has to stay, clear of them during nursing. \n\nYta\n\nThe infant is going to be negatively affected", "Not only NTA, you're an amazing partner. That's a lovely, thoughtful gift and not even close to inappropriate on any level.", "NTA. That is thoughtful to gift her those items. A sealed bottle of wine will be there and ready for her when she is ready for a glass. Her parents most likely won't be pleased with you for awhile. They should realize their daughter was equally responsible for making a baby.", "NTA. You put effort and thought into that basket to show her how much you appreciated her sacrifice.

It's a bottle of wine, not a bottle of milk! I was gifted a two-glass mini bottle of champagne when my son was born, I ended up drinking it for my wedding anniversary ten months later.

It is an insightful gift.", "Then you\u2019re fine. The only person who\u2019s opinion counts here is your girlfriend.", "I had my daughter three months ago, and your gift basket sounds wonderful. Absolutely NTA, to be honest, your in laws sound jealous because they didn't think of it first. I'd happily take the food and drink items I had to avoid over flashy jewellery as push presents these days. \n\nMy partner gifted me some of my fave take out items once we got home - in particular KFC - as it has the highest MSG content, which is horrendous during pregnancy. \n\nKeep doing what you are doing. If your girlfriend and little one are happy and healthy, that is all that matters.", "NTA\n\nI think it's sweet, it shows you acknowledging what she went through and you appreciating it. \n\nThe wine doesn't expire and can wait for whenever she feels comfortable drinking again. They need to calm down and stop looking for reasons to despise you.", "As a mum of 3 kids under 5 who currently breastfeeds and drinks alcohol and coffee responsibility (with the permission of my kids pediatrician and my own doctor) NTA and a very thoughtful caring partner.", "NTA - a friend came while I was in hospital and filled my fridge with soft cheese, small goods and booze.

I was gifted a bottle of vodka after my second kid. It is a very appreciated, welcomed gift", "NTA, great gift, you seem to be doing things alright and her parents should fuck right off.", "NTA", "NTA. Such a thoughtful gift.", "NTA this is so incredibly sweet! Don\u2019t worry about the alcohol. The percentage that makes it into breast milk is an every smaller percentage of what makes it into the blood stream. Plus, importantly, alcohol *leaves* breast milk at the same rate it leaves the blood stream. Personally I always start my drink either right after a feed or during a feed. Then it\u2019s all out or significantly reduced in my system by the next feed. Plus, I\u2019m partial to beer because it gives my breast milk supply a boost in production.", "NTA - that was really thoughtful", "NTA - I have friends who busted out the sushi and wine whilst still in the hospital! \ud83d\ude03 my fav story is the friend who sent her husband to a fish market at 4am to buy fresh oysters hours after she gave birth \ud83d\ude02 your gift was very thoughtful.", "NAH since her parents aren't really assholes for expressing concerns about the alcohol. They probably still think that alcohol is a 100% no go during breastfeeding and need to accept new status quo of today's science. This will probably repeat itself over various things like \"you have to put the baby down to sleep or it won't sleep alone\" - \"you have to take a break between breastfeedings\" - \"you have to be careful to not spoil your baby\" and many many more. All of these are not true. You need to establish boundaries with them over these issues, OP, and you need to start with that right away before the comments get to you or your girlfriend. The only person you need to discuss these things with are your girlfriend and maybe the pediatrician.\n\nYou're very sweet and yes, your wife doesn't need to drink the whole bottle in an evening and she can consume a little wine even during breastfeeding. Congratulations! In a few months, you'll very probably have calm evenings you can spend with your girlfriend. It's worth it.", "NTA. Great gift. Only thing I would say from personal experience is that coffee will effect breast milk and give your baby an upset tummy, which can be painful for them.", "What a sweet, thoughtful gift to have waiting for her! I bet your girlfriend really enjoyed the basket and appreciated the thought you put into the items. Her parents need to step back; this is a two person relationship and their criticism of such inconsequential things isn't appropriate. NTA. Your gf will have to be the one to put them in their place if things continue this way tho", "NTA I think you are an awesome partner", "NTA. Right after I had my second baby, the afterpains during nursing (cramps from the uterus shrinking back down) made me tense up all over in fear because the feeling was so similar to early labor. It was a reaction that had nothing to do with the thinking part of the brain and couldn\u2019t be reasoned away. A small amount of alcohol (about a wine glass of cider with an alcohol content similar to beer - I\u2019m a lightweight) tamped down the feeling enough to let me get past the first hour or so of nursing. I didn\u2019t drink while nursing after that, not a regular drinker at any time.", "NTA, that's a lovely gift!\n\nAnd it's fine to have a glass of wine while breastfeeding. If she wants to be extra cautious, she can wait until baby is going 2 hours between feedings and drink it right after nursing.", "NTA - it\u2019s a really sweet gift. You could get your gf anything and her parents would likely hate it. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, you did great! Keep up the good work and give your gf the present if you haven\u2019t already!!", "NTA. Her parents really don\u2019t like you.", "You're an absolute love.", "The hospital have my mom a bottle of champagne when she had my little brother. They saved it. Her parents are just looking for something to criticize you over. I think your gift was incredibly sweet. NTA.", "Definitely NTA. What you did was really sweet and caring. Parents are dicks and I expect I'll see you posting r/justnomil and other related subs.", "NTA and definitely very sweet. Even if she doesn\u2019t drink the wine for a couple of months while she\u2019s on a tighter feeding schedule it\u2019s still sweet that you have recognised the sacrifices she has made while carrying your baby and want her to have the treats she enjoys back. Sounds like her parents have other issues that have nothing to do with the basket.", "NTA it sounds like the gift as a whole served it's purpose of making your girlfriend happy and giving her some treats to show she's cared about and appreciated. It's a bottle of wine, even if you or your girlfriend were concerned about even low-moderate alcohol consumption while breastfeeding, the bottle will last until your baby is weaned, but also most research suggests there would be no ill effects on the baby if your wife enjoyed the bottle over several days. \n\nIt sounds like you're a caring, thoughtful and supportive partner, seems like her parents have just decided to dislike you and the things you do from the get go and are looking for reasons to be mad. They aren't worth listening to if that is their attitude", "NTA.\n\nI found out I was pregnant with my firstborn 2 days before my birthday. It was an amazing gift, and made my birthday so much better.... BUT, several friends gifted me alcohol that ended up being re-gifted or consumed by other folks over the next several months.\n\nThe day we brought little guy home, my had a gift basket of the (not cheap!) liquors I had been gifted for my birthday. I was so touched by her thoughtfulness on this.", "NTA that was sweet of u... ignore her parents...", "NTA. I think it is wonderful what you did for you girlfriend.", "NTA. It was a really nice and thoughtful gesture.", "NTA - are they saying their daughter have  such a lack of self control and inability to comprehend alcohol effects, than she will drink alcohol straight away after giving birth if she is gifted a bottle? \n\nTheir way of belittling you only show their own lack of respect for their daughter extended to you. This isn\u2019t on you. \n\nExcept for someone in recovery or unable to control their alcohol intake, there is nothing immature about gifting a bottle. \n\nThat was thoughtful. The only thing mattering is what the recipient of the gift think of it.", "NTA sounds like they are just trying to find fault. You say they disapproved of you after your GF got pregnant- I\u2019d bet that\u2019s all it is. They are just trying to find reasons to be contentious.\n\nI think what you did was an incredibly sweet and thoughtful gift! Congratulations on your new baby!\n\nBe careful that your GF\u2019s parents don\u2019t weasel in and make trouble for you guys. Get on the same page with your girlfriend and be a team. Don\u2019t let them bully you guys.", "NTA this sounds really thoughtful to me.", "NAH. The intention was positive but all of it was inappropriate for a new mother, and you do sound a bit immature. I'm wondering if you think everything snaps back to normal the moment the baby arrives? Give it another nine months and things will feel more normal.", "NTA.\nNo one told her to finish that bottle of booze right away, right? Nope, great gift.\n\nHer parents are partly right about alcohol and breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, it is better not to drink alcohol. If you do want to drink alcohol, you must wait three hours per glass of alcohol before breastfeeding again. For example, if you have drunk three glasses, you have to wait 9 hours. Do you express breast milk during this time? Then throw it away.\nAlcohol also passes into breast milk through the blood. If your baby ingests alcohol, it is harmful and can cause problems.\n\nBut it's a verry thoughtful gift!", "I had champagne whilst still in hospital. Supplied by the hospital. NTA", "They are the AHs for calling him immature and expressing their out of date, unwanted opinion as fact.", "That\u2019s Absolutely incorrect scientific and medical about breastmilk.", "That is actually not scientifically accurate information anymore drinking one standard drink is same alcohol content in breastmilk as orange juice, alcohol doesn\u2019t entire breastmilk in the same extent or rate like it does blood but it does metabolise at the same rate as blood so the only way for milk to have enough alcohol content in it to pose any sort of risk is nearly humanly impossible to the average responsible drinker because they would need to consume such a incredibly incredibly high amount and also have it not metabolise at the average rate but much slower too. Also pumping and dumping isn\u2019t recommended anymore either only really if you are on specific unsafe medications.", "Oh nice! I would accept you as a Son in law. They are free to express their concern, but it is not their decision as to what their adult daughter can and cannot do. You and gf are the parents, and gma needs to butt out.", "I thought she loved coffee?", " Your gifts sound thoughtful and generous, and your girlfriend\u2019s parents sound like assholes.", "You need a new bf because he sounds like a dick.", "That is your judgment of the situation while I formed a different judgment.", "100% agree with the caffeine. We never found any issue with alcohol though.", "You think I came up with this info myself? This literally comes from a hospital page in collaboration with our ministry of health.", "?", "I personally love coffee and wine\u2026", "Wtf? This makes zero sense in context. Bot?", "It\u2019s one of the top comments from another post about a woman asking her boyfriend to hold her bag, must be a bot farming karma."]}
