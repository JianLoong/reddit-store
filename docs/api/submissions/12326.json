The percentage that makes it into breast milk is an every smaller percentage of what makes it into the blood stream.

Right after I had my second baby, the afterpains during nursing (cramps from the uterus shrinking back down) made me tense up all over in fear because the feeling was so similar to early labor. It was a reaction that had nothing to do with the thinking part of the brain and couldn\u2019t be reasoned away. A small amount of alcohol (about a wine glass of cider with an alcohol content similar to beer - I\u2019m a lightweight) tamped down the feeling enough to let me get past the first hour or so of nursing. I didn\u2019t drink while nursing after that, not a regular drinker at any time.", "NTA, that's a lovely gift!\n\nAnd it's fine to have a glass of wine while breastfeeding.

Even if she doesn\u2019t drink the wine for a couple of months while she\u2019s on a tighter feeding schedule it\u2019s still sweet that you have recognised the sacrifices she has made while carrying your baby and want her to have the treats she enjoys back. Sounds like her parents have other issues that have nothing to do with the basket.", "NTA it sounds like the gift as a whole served it's purpose of making your girlfriend happy and giving her some treats to show she's cared about and appreciated. It's a bottle of wine, even if you or your girlfriend were concerned about even low-moderate alcohol consumption while breastfeeding, the bottle will last until your baby is weaned, but also most research suggests there would be no ill effects on the baby if your wife enjoyed the bottle over several days. \n\nIt sounds like you're a caring, thoughtful and supportive partner, seems like her parents have just decided to dislike you and the things you do from the get go and are looking for reasons to be mad.

It\u2019s a sweet gesture in my book.", "NAH. The intention was positive but all of it was inappropriate for a new mother, and you do sound a bit immature.

Give it another nine months and things will feel more normal.", "NTA.\nNo one told her to finish that bottle of booze right away, right? Nope, great gift.\n\nHer parents are partly right about alcohol and breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, it is better not to drink alcohol. If you do want to drink alcohol, you must wait three hours per glass of alcohol before breastfeeding again. For example, if you have drunk three glasses, you have to wait 9 hours. Do you express breast milk during this time? Then throw it away.\nAlcohol also passes into breast milk through the blood. If your baby ingests alcohol, it is harmful and can cause problems.\n\nBut it's a verry thoughtful gift!", "I had champagne whilst still in hospital. Supplied by the hospital. NTA", "They are the AHs for calling him immature and expressing their out of date, unwanted opinion as fact.", "That\u2019s Absolutely incorrect scientific and medical about breastmilk.", "That is actually not scientifically accurate information anymore drinking one standard drink is same alcohol content in breastmilk as orange juice, alcohol doesn\u2019t entire breastmilk in the same extent or rate like it does blood but it does metabolise at the same rate as blood so the only way for milk to have enough alcohol content in it to pose any sort of risk is nearly humanly impossible to the average responsible drinker because they would need to consume such a incredibly incredibly high amount and also have it not metabolise at the average rate but much slower too. Also pumping and dumping isn\u2019t recommended anymore either only really if you are on specific unsafe medications.", "Oh nice! I would accept you as a Son in law.

My husband made me my favourite Italian pasta dish with raw eggs and poured me a glass of white wine when I got home from the hospital; it was HEAVENLY.", "NTA and your gift was very thoughtful.  When she wants a glass of wine or a cup of coffee, she can pre-pump.  Your in-laws are the immature.", "NTA\nThat's a really lovely gift. \"Here's all these things you gave up and really missed, in case you crave any one of them right now\". What a nice way to mark the occasion.", "* Disclamer*\n\nI don't use reddit often and sometimes i just read and dont comment often, yet when I have in the past, my comments have been removed because I *might be a bot*.  Hopefully this stops happening.   Because how can I prove I'm a real person if whoever is monitoring these pages automatically assumes im a bot because I don't have many comments when I try but I always get deleted???? \n\n\n As for this situation,  I felt compelled to mention that I didn't obtain from coffee at all, through 3 pregnancies... with my doctor's approval,  up to 2 cups a day were safe... so the coffee thing is kinda weird to me.... \n\nBut also, my kids are much older so I don't know what the \"rules\" would be now,  but I remember advice of breastfeeding moms were that if you had a glass of wine,  you might have to pump and dump the next session of milk if it's immediately after?  Although I don't think you had to if it was just a glass and 2 hours later?? \n\nNeedless to say, she should be able to drink a cup of coffee and enjoy a glass of wine.  The alcohol content does leave your body after a certain time,  and so does the caffeine right?  And it's not as if the baby is directly connected to her anymore.   They are just looking for excuses to make you the bad guy.\n\nAlso not everyone breastfeeds.  I assume your gf is... but what if she wasn't?  \n\nWho matters most is the one the gift is for.  If she liked it, that's what counts.", "NTA!\nSuch a sweet gift", "NTA\n\nThey're only saying that because they don't like you. If they liked you, they'd have applauded the sentiment.", "I'm currently pregnant and I used to love coffee as well. I think this is super sweet and I'd be thrilled if my husband did something similar (although maybe not the sushi part \ud83d\ude09). Your girlfriends parents sound awful, I get that they might be disappointed if you got your girlfriend pregnant and they didn't see that at her age or whatever... but at the end of the day you're adults and you are also parents, who clearly care about each other.\n\nNot only are you NTA I think you're the complete opposite. You were really thoughtful and that's soooo important because sometimes pregnant women and new mothers can feel like their wants and needs are ignored for the new baby. \n\nAlso congratulations, based on your post you sound like an excellent boyfriend and father \ud83d\udc90\ud83e\udd73", "NTA\n\nYour mind was in the right place.\n\nThe appropriateness of the gifts can be debated, but that's separate.", "NTA and honestly her parents already don\u2019t approve of you so just own it and do what you want. It was sweet of you to think of it.", "INFO: What did your girlfriend think of the gift?\n\nAnyway, NTA. Seeing as how her parents never liked you after you deposited a bun in her oven, this is just another means to an end to drive you away. I think it's really sweet of you and of course your girlfriend is not expected to drink that entire bottle in one go. Her parents are being ridiculous.", "NTA. Just saying it to reaffirm the already stated reasons why. \n\nYou\u2019re a fucking sweetheart dude.", "Very sweet \u2764\ufe0f and You did not get her pregnant. This is a partnership. I\u2019m sorry you have difficult future in laws but you need to assert yourself pretty quickly or this will drizzle down to the care of your child. Congratulations!", "NTA.  We say it's the thought that counts, then most people devote two seconds to buying a gift card.  You really thought about what your girlfriend gave up and would want to enjoy again.  Ignore her parents.  Her father wishes he were that romantic, and her mother wishes it too.", "NTA that was loving and thoughtful .  My husband brought me Brie and ham!  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for the in-laws to be given a step back since they\u2019re trying to underMine you", "NTA. super thoughtful. Wish I\u2019d received that after delivery", "NTA. Alcohol in moderation doesn\u2019t pass to your milk, and beer is actually good for milk production. I think your gift was very sweet and thoughtful.", "NTA, this is so sweet! And this is coming from a pregnant and breastfeeding person. So thoughtful!", "NTA. My wife is pregnant and looking forward to eating a sub, sushi, having some coffee, and having a glass of wine. It\u2019s pretty much all she wants after she gets out of the hospital.", "That was an amazingly sweet thoughtful gift!  Her parents need to get over y'all having a baby while living together out of wedlock.  I wouldn't worry about what they think, what matters is how much your girlfriend loved it and unless I missed it somehow, you never said......so did she love it?!", "NTA.\n\nIt's a really thoughtful gift, one that doesn't have to be used immediately. She can drink the wine and coffee whenever she feels ready, or when the doctor gives her the okay.", "NTA - it's a very thoughtful gift. I think it's hilarious they were probably trying to find other things wrong with the contents of a very fine sounding hamper and they could only come up with 'fine wine is an immature gift' \ud83d\ude02\n\nHave to say its incredibly common to gift alcohol in the UK, champers is a frequent gift to parents especially for your first child. They even use bottles of booze as the core of nappy cakes here! At worst, your gift is very european!", "Oh FFS, do they think you're going to pin her down and poor it down her throat?\n\nNTA.  Did your girlfriend like the gift? That's all that matters.", "This is so nice of you. One of the first things I did after my pregnancy were getting sushi and a steak.... Rare!\n\nJust having the things there she likes is great. NTA.", "So the alcohol can get into breastmilk, but studies have shown only at the BAC level.\n\nSo the legal limit for driving is .08% right?  Imagine drinking a beer that was .08%.  For context, normal non alcoholic Welch's grape juice can have ten times that amount.  \n\nLike being sloshed around your baby isn't a good idea but not because of the alcohol you get through breastmilk. The risk of nursing while drunk is falling asleep on or not being as physically aware of your baby.  The risks of passing alcohol through breastmilk are pretty miniscule.", "Right?  It\u2019s not like he \u201ciced\u201d her. \n\nWine is literally known to get better if it is saved a bit.", "If I was the girlfriend I'd be so overwhelmed with happiness at such a thoughtful gift.\n\nA lot of the time there's so much excitement over the new baby that the mum can feel excluded or forgotten.", "Applause and accolades! The less they know, the better. Good comment!", "> Idk how her parents saw the gift\n\nReading", "Also it might be worth discussing this with the girlfriend and explaining how they're treating him and making sure she understands that he needs her support in keeping their relationship private.", "Few glasses of wine is not fine per CDC. 150ml of vine per day 2 hours before feeding is fine per CDC. They explicitly claim that more then that can affect the infant.", "> in particular kfc as it has the highest MSG content which is horrendous during pregnancy\n\nThis is absolute nonsense, more ridiculous even than what OP's inlaws are freaking out about.", "Please don't misrepresent what OP wrote.  Her parents didn't \"express concerns about the alcohol\".  Her parents insulted OP and called him names.  That's not the same thing.", "The infant is probably more negatively affected by having hateful nasty people in the house stirring shit and insulting one of the parents.", "Some hospitals provide new north parents a romantic dinner which includes champagne so I doubt a single glass occasionally would hurt.  Especially if you have a glass immediately after breast feeding so there\u2019s time for the alcohol to be metabolized before the next feeding.  Parents are controlling and ride.  It word a sweet gift.", "I'd be more worried about the sushi in the gift bag, tbh. Just hoping OP threw in a cooler, too.", "[deleted]", "Yup a bottle of wine has a decent shelf life.", "My wife sent me out as soon as she was able to eat, still in the hospital, to get her a club sandwich. She hadn't had cold cuts during pregnancy and was seriously in the mood for it.", "Caffeine is also passed through breast milk and I don\u2019t see her parents complaining about the keurig", "You sound like an absolute delight. 10/10 OP. \nOne thing that jumps out is women often get lots of gifts that are baby related post birth. That is obviously kind and generous but your gift is thoughtful and recognises your girlfriends identity outside of her role as a mother.", "Your girlfriend is fine with her parents being up your ass like this?", "I'm 8 weeks away from having the biggest cup of coffee in my life. My husband better have our keureg basket filled to the brim with the good stuff and, for extra measure, whole beans for our heavy duty machine.\n\nI miss caffeine more than anything... I know I can have small amounts but it's the one thing my husband asked me to cut out. Plus the little tadpole does the backstroke for an hour if I even take a few sips of soda.\n\nYou did good, OP. You did good.\n\nNTA", "I'd get her a thermos to pop the coffee in to keep warm...babies do not like letting you drink hot drinks...", "Same.  With each child.", "I can't get enough of your word choice here. Calling wine \"feral\" is absolutely hilarious \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut to stay on topic, I totally agree: OP's gift of wine was reasonable and thoughtful. His girlfriend 's parents need to get over themselves.", "It's based on outdated info. Look up recent research. In multiple European countries the advice is now to not drink to the point that you are affected while handling children, breastfeeding or not.", "Why? She was capable of refusing consent and potentially had the option of an abortion.  She's a 24yo woman. Why is it \"better\" to treat her like she has no control over her life or body and is at the mercy of a man's sexual whims?", "This is what american CDC have to say:\n\n>Not drinking alcohol is the safest option for breastfeeding mothers. Generally, moderate alcohol consumption by a breastfeeding mother (up to 1 standard drink per day) is not known to be harmful to the infant, especially if the mother waits at least 2 hours after a single drink before nursing.

Alcohol consumption above moderate levels may also impair a mother\u2019s judgment and ability to safely care for her child.\n\nAlso, 1 standard drink is 150ml of vine.

It looked yummy.", "u/Super_Print3318 is a bot.", "Ffs bot, could you be more obvious???", "To be fair, the impact of alcohol and impact of caffeine on people including babies are much different.", "It would be very sad if OP's girlfriend isn't on his side when her parents are treating him like crap.", "She may not even know.  They likely didn't say any of that in front of her, and maybe OP didn't tell her about it because he didn't want her upset when she had just come home from giving birth.", "i meant in the eyes of society it is more accepted that he blamed himself for getting her pregnant rather than blaming her for getting pregnant", "I mean, of course.
