A small amount of alcohol (about a wine glass of cider with an alcohol content similar to beer - I\u2019m a lightweight) tamped down the feeling enough to let me get past the first hour or so of nursing.

It's a bottle of wine, even if you or your girlfriend were concerned about even low-moderate alcohol consumption while breastfeeding, the bottle will last until your baby is weaned, but also most research suggests there would be no ill effects on the baby if your wife enjoyed the bottle over several days. \n\nIt sounds like you're a caring, thoughtful and supportive partner, seems like her parents have just decided to dislike you and the things you do from the get go and are looking for reasons to be mad.

Nope, great gift.\n\nHer parents are partly right about alcohol and breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, it is better not to drink alcohol. If you do want to drink alcohol, you must wait three hours per glass of alcohol before breastfeeding again. For example, if you have drunk three glasses, you have to wait 9 hours. Do you express breast milk during this time? Then throw it away.\nAlcohol also passes into breast milk through the blood.

Also pumping and dumping isn\u2019t recommended anymore either only really if you are on specific unsafe medications.", "Oh nice! I would accept you as a Son in law.

The general rule of them is I remember is drink alcohol preferably right after breast feeding to maximize time before the next feeding, but also unless you are quite tipsy going on drunk, like the amount that is going into to the breast milk is incredibly small. You\u2019re NOT about to harm your baby off you have a glass or two of wine 2-3 hours before you feed again.

How can you be upset that they have the best interest of your grandchild at heart?\n\nYou mentioned you did research but didn't say what the research said.

I'm not going to say what your girlfriend can and can't eat because I don't know for sure, but I'd recommend checking with her doctor first to be safe.

By the time you had enough Alcohol in your blood stream to actually effect the baby you'd be dead. Id compare it to throwing a shot of vodka in a kiddie pool, fruit juice has more alcohol in it than breast milk. The big risk of drinking and nursing comes from the risk of dropping the baby because you're tipsy. A stout beer actually can help stimulate milk production at first.

As long as your girlfriend isn\u2019t siding with them, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Focus on being a good father and partner and try to ignore them!", "NTA. Your GF\u2019s parents are assholes. This is a sweet gift.", "NTA \n\nIf your gf liked it, it was a good gift.", "NTA. Your girlfriend's parents are the ones who are uneducated. Hardly any alcohol gets in breast milk. It's not even advised to \"pump and dump\" anymore. \n\nAlso, this was a wonderful gift for your girlfriend. I hope she appreciated it! I know I would have.", "NTA!!  After I had my son (I did not nurse) I told my then husband I wanted a case of beer that I like in the house when I got home.  It probably took me 2 months to drink because, you know there was now a baby, but I think they were thoughtful gifts.", "NTA. You're very sweet. Did your girlfriend not stand up for you? Her parents need to not be allowed back in the house until they show respect. You're living together. Sex makes babies. What were they expecting? Celibacy while living together?", "NTA\n\nBut what did your girlfriend do to defend you while her parents berated you for something that didn\u2019t concern them whatsoever?", "NTA. Many would love to have a thoughtfull partner like you.", "NTA this is actually such a thoughtful gift!! The first thing i wanted after having a a baby was some sushi rolls and a huge deli meat sandwich!!\n\ni would be thrilled to get this as a gift after having a baby. you did a great job with that gift!", "Nta- as a mom who breast fed, it is fine to drink but watch how much she intakes. After 8-13% of alcohol it can go to the baby. But usually it will just make the baby sleepy", "NTA..... it's a bottle of wine not a six pack and shots. Congratulations on fatherhood! It was a very thoughtful gift.", "NTA What a sweet and thoughtful gift (I hope the sushi was a gift certificate for dinner at a sushi place). I would have loved that gift! As for her parents, just smile and say that none of this needs to be consumed right now. Wine often betters with age as does your daughter. She is a delightful person and she deserves to have all that she likes. She has given me a beautiful gift and I wanted to give her her favorites. She doesn\u2019t need to have it right this second. Or if she would like to have a glass of wine after she\u2019s fed our beautiful baby, the doctor says it fine.", "NTA. The new guidance for breastfeeding and drinking is if you can find the baby, you can feed the baby. She can drink herself silly and not get the baby buzzed. Her parents are just old and uneducated", "This is an absolutely awful idea\u2026.sorry I meant adorable idea. I don\u2019t know how anyone can be giving you crap for this! She will love it and it\u2019s a very sweet gesture on your part. Ignore them and go with it. Even if she plans to save them and wants to stay teetotal over breastfeeding time she will still love the thought that went into it! You are 100% NTA and I\u2019m betting there are a whole lot of women out there showing this to their baby daddies or daddies to be and asking why they didn\u2019t do that \ud83d\ude02", "Absolutely NTA. This was super sweet. Don\u2019t let them discourage you from being a thoughtful partner. The alcohol metabolizes out of breast milk fairly quickly. Most moms just pump and dump that little bit. I believe you can get test strips that will show if there\u2019s alcohol present.", "NTA. When my husband and I got home from the hospital, my parents had left sushi and red wine for me (us I guess haha). It was the best treat. That was a super thoughtful thing you did. Her parents need to get over this negativity towards you, they\u2019re sort of stuck with you!\nAlso, alcohol does not get into your breastmilk. The outdated information. If I were you, I\u2019d print out a bunch of research for them.", "NTA. Her parents are the assholes because they blame you for knocking up their precious daughter. You are awesome and thoughtful. I hope things get earlier for both you and your girlfriend. Keep her parents away, they are controlling and ignorant. Congratulations!", "NTA that was very kind of you to buy her a thoughtful gift.  It was a bit rude of the parents to criticise you.  She might not want coffee or wine right away but I hope she appreciated it.", "NTA - what a lovely idea. I have a friend who was breastfeeding up until recently, and she would have a beer or a glass of wine occasionally. It's not like your partner is going to drink the whole bottle in one go.", "NTA. That is very sweet and thoughtful of you. I know plenty of mothers who have alcohol just days after birth. They plan their breastfeeding hours around it, or do things like pump and dumps. It's not like you opened the wine and said HAVE IT NOW - it's corked for her to have when she chooses.", "NTA. You did the sweetest thing. When I was pregnant (3 kids, 3 pregnancies) the things I avoided were manageable, but by the end I wanted them so badly. The biggest one was deli meats. The first thing my husband got me after I have birth with my third was a cold cut sub exactly how I like it. I cried. Literally. I was so happy. Alcohol can get into the breast milk in small amounts, but it's not considered harmful. A common  saying to help is \"if you can find the baby, you can feed the baby.\" Basically don't nurse if you're blackout drunk or something, but a couple of glasses of wine won't hurt anything. And might help her relax a bit - the newborn phase is hard as hell.", "NTA - you\u2019re so sweet!", "NTA...\n\nThat was the sweetest gesture.  I breast fed both my children.  I drank alcohol after a pumped a supply so I could dump. Her parent dislike you for their own selfish reasons and want you to feel bad.  Make your own family and be happy. Communicate with your girlfriend how you feel and explain your gift to her let her decide not her parents", "NTA - you\u2019re not expecting her to drink the bottle of wine in one sitting right this very second. Sounds like her parents wouldn\u2019t have been satisfied with anything you got her. \n\nIf gf appreciates the sentiment, then that\u2019s all that matters. \n\nI am going to borrow this idea and stock up my bestie with all the Red Bull her cabinets can fit once she\u2019s done with her pregnancy.", "NTA\n\nWho cares what your in laws think, as long as your girlfriend likes it, that's all that matters.", "NTA, but as others have stated the only one who can really give the verdict that matters is your girlfriend.  Maintaining her supply is important but she can always pump and dump if her supply is good.  \n\nMy daughter was a premie and was on prescribed caffeine for most her life early on.  \n\nObviously just speak with the pediatrician and all that, most if not all of that is probably useable.  Parents are just butt hurt as long as your gf is cool with it.  Just make sure the parents don\u2019t brainwash her, your girlfriends hormone floodgates are open right now postpartum and folks trying to manipulate her wouldn\u2019t do anyone any good.", "OP. We have this conversation in r/breastfeeding and other r/mommit all the time. One or two glasses will not hurt her. But I always refer to the cdc website. 12% ABV at 5oz will not effect the baby if she drinks a glass and waits 2 hours. \n\nPump and dump isn\u2019t even a thing anymore. And most of the conversations that are had is that alcohol hasn\u2019t even been detected (using those strips) even right after a glass of wine. I won\u2019t get plastered. And my 4mo is only breast fed at nap time, morning and night anymore. I was more cautious when she was younger. But there is no saying your wife can\u2019t save the bottle if she\u2019s uncomfortable with drinking it, it\u2019s there when she\u2019s ready. \n\nHer parents are just being dumb cause they dislike you and they are willing to look down on anything you do. \n\nNTA. Good for you. I am glad your wife had a good man with her! It\u2019s a lot better than the husband stories I always read in those pregnancy and new baby subs. \n\nKeep being awesome.", "NTA.  I think that's a cute idea and her parents are being petty.  If she is concerned about the alcohol, she can save it.  It's not like you're pouring it down her throat.", "You ARE overthinking this. Laugh it off. Let it roll off your back, water off a duck \u2026. I had in laws that were overly critical of me too. Did your girlfriend get the joke ?? Was she amused by the cheeky gifts ?? Because really that\u2019s all that  matters. If girlfriend was not amused by the fun you were trying to create, return what you can and try again. Some flowers and a gift certificate to a spa. A nice mani/ pedi or relaxing treatments. Don\u2019t worry about her parents. If they don\u2019t like you. You\u2019ll never ever change it. Just focus on her and be the best version of a man you can be , for her\u2026.", "NTA- What a thoughtful gift!", "NTA at all, her parents sound like assholes though", "NTA - I think the gifts are amazing and you knowing what she enjoys is soo sweet. Nine months is a very long time. \n\nAsk your girlfriend. Doesn't matter what her parents think or anything. You're right though, alcohol won't go through the breastmilk.", "Were they expecting a marriage proposal or a commitment beyond baby daddy?  No,You're NTA by any stretch for bringing a gift, but if they were expecting something to affirm you are aware of your obligations as a father and you brought a basket, I could see why they might feel a little upset.  I wonder if they disapprove of their daughter's life choices, and are pissed she's now living at with then with a newborn. I can't help but wonder if there are much bigger issues at play.", "NTA, I wish I had had a partner that supportive!  Her parents sound like idiots honestly.  Congrats on the baby!", "NTA - begin as  you mean to go on with these in-laws tho.  Advise them that you will consider their comments and then live your life and do what you want to do.  Grey rocking them is going to be a lifesaver for you.", "Nta", "NTA not at all.", "lol is this me from 10 years ago? Words of warning: the in laws don\u2019t really get better\u2026", "NTA.  Her parents are the ones who are uneducated.  When my sister was breastfeeding her boys (now 6 and 11) our mom would offer her a glass of wine with dinner.  Our mom is a ***retired pediatric surgical nurse***, if a nurse is okay with a breast-feeding mom drinking wine, then your girlfriend is fine to drink it.  Her parents are stuck in the past with outdated information.  As my mother loves to point out when my older sister was born, they brought her home from the hospital in a dresser drawer and the hospital didn't bat an eye (this was 1978).  When my sister brought her oldest home, the hospital wouldn't let them leave the parking lot until my sister and BIL both demonstrated they knew how to properly install/uninstall the car seat, buckle my nephew in and properly adjust the restraint belts to fit my nephew.  Times change and her parents need to catch up with the new information out there.\n\nBesides all of that your girlfriend doesn't have to finish the bottle of wine in one sitting nor does she have to immediately open it.  Sometimes it's better to wait because wine does continue to age in sealed bottles, and it might get better over time.\n\nI bet the next conflict is going to be \"You need to put the baby to sleep on their belly, their crib needs to have bumpers and the baby needs a blanket over them because they'll get cold!\"  Recent research shows that back to sleep is best, crib bumpers and blankets are a suffocation hazard.", "NTA\n\nI'm sure your gf will ABSOLUTELY appreciate this. It's thoughtful, wholesome and cute. You're a keeper, OP.\n\nHer parents can fuck off. Their daughter is a grown woman *with a child.*", "NTA. That was a very thoughtful gift. Did your gf like it? Her feelings are the only ones that matter here.", "Nta.\n\nEven if she wanted to consume the entire bottle she can feed formula until safe to resume breast feeding.\n\nIt was a kind and endearing gesture. Good on ya.", "Absolutely NTA!!! You\u2019re a true hero and clearly love and respect this woman.", "NTA\n\nWhat a sweet and thoughtful gift.\n\nHer parents can take off.", "NTA this was very thoughtful of you", "NTA. They don't like you because you knocked up their little girl. As long as she liked it, there'snothing to be concernedabout. It was a very thoughtful gesture. Congratulations on your child.", "Nta, and you are very thoughtful! What a great gift idea.", "NTA- why do you care so much what her parents thought of the gift? Her reaction is the only one that matters.", "The theme of your gift was well intentioned and fun. Alcohol lasts forever, it\u2019s a nice gift even if your gal waited months or years to consume it. Unless she has no impulse control, you are NTA and in-laws are TA.", "NTA. She\u2019s not even calling you one. Tell her parents to put a sock in it lol.", "NTA, you didn't do anything wrong. They just wanted a reason to be rude to you.", "NTA \n\nNo one says your gf can\u2019t pump and drink it later. Also, perhaps she doesn\u2019t need to breastfeed the entire time?\u2026.. Lastly and most importantly\u2026.. No one asked them for their opinion!!! The only opinion that matters is your gf\u2019s!!", "Your gf\u2019s parents are looking for things to complain about, it was a sweet gift. And she doesn\u2019t have to drink it right away!", "Nah!, they don't like you and that's it. NTA. They are looking for excuses to make you look bad. You would be the AH if you included small size clothes, like my BIL did...", "NTA.\n\nHer parents are uneducated. It has been proven that an occasional glass of wine is not only not harmful for the baby, it is actually beneficial. When I was nursing my youngest, the doctor suggested drinking an occasional Guinness.\n\nAlso, wine, as most educated and uneducated people know, will hold up well until ready for use.", "That's a thoughtful gift. NTA, her parents are AHs, though.", "Honest to goodness we've come to the \"AITA for treating my girlfriend well and spoiling her after giving birth\" corner of the internet.  \n\n\nHer parents are going to have to learn you guys are a family unit now, they're trying to break that down.

My understanding is that what a breast-feeding mom consumes, the baby consumes. Your heart was in the right place, though. Aside from the sushi, she could indulge in the other stuff when she felt she was ready. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t anticipate their reaction, though, which might reveal some insensitivity on your part. Also, stop saying \u201cI got her pregnant.\u201d Obviously, she got pregnant. Maybe less obviously, it was you, but there\u2019s no need to say it that way, which is crude and unnecessary. \u201cShe got pregnant,\u201d or \u201cwe got pregnant\u201d is kinder.", "NTA, as long as she drinks it in moderation a glass or two depending on her tolerance it's fine. I went to wineries and breweries with my breastfeeding baby. Obviously I didn't get smashed or go often, but a glass or two doesn't get in the breastmilk enough to do anything.", "NTA.

Her parents can STFU and GTFO. Drinking a glass of wine while breastfeeding is fine (though tricky if you're trying to do both at the same time \ud83d\ude09). You did good, OP!", "NTA. In fact, I find your gift very thoughtful. I had an immensely long list of things I planned to eat and drink after each of my pregnancies, and wish my husband would have brought them to the hospital for me. In fairness, both of my deliveries we premature and unexpected\u2026I think your GF\u2019s parents are both uneducated and looking for reasons to find fault. Sushi is 100% okay. Alcohol (1, maybe 2) drinks and limited caffeine are totally okay. As with all things, moderation is important but this is your GFs decision to make. \n\nP.S. if your GF breastfeeds, she may find she metabolizes alcohol faster, and she won\u2019t feel tipsy as quickly. That\u2019s why it\u2019s generally better to limi drinks to a specific number, rather that using tipsiness as a cut off. If she pumps, she does not need to pump and dump unless she\u2019s over consumed. But you can use the pitcher method to mix alcohol free and alcohol milk together to dilute the overall amount of alcohol in the milk as an added safety precaution. There are also general advisories about how to time feeds and drinks to avoid feeding baby when BAC is likely to peak. All this to say, I hope your GF enjoys the wine!", "NTA! Not one bit.

Great gift!", "Nta.\n\nThat's a very thoughtful gift", "NTA I think it\u2019s pretty cool what you did.", "INFO what does your gf think of your gift?\n\nHers is the only opinion that matters.\n\nAlso, if your gf chooses to breastfeed, she will know about the alcohol and caffeine. Neither wine nor coffee pods go out of date within weeks or a few months, so your gf can enjoy both when SHE is ready to do so.", "NTA, also, its perfectly safe to have a cup or two of coffee a day *while* pregnant", " INFO: It really doesn't matter what your in-laws thought. What did your gf think?", "Definitely NTA. Should have thrown in some cigarettes and deli meats though.", "Also pump and dump exists! It\u2019s not like every ounce of breast milk is going to be fed to the baby, there will be times she may need to express it when the baby isn\u2019t hungry and she can also pump and store it for times where she has had a drink and the baby needs to be fed, that way milk that was pumped before a drink is available.\n\nHer parents just wanna be mad at OP for doing something thoughtful for her.", "Also, there is the option to \u201cpump and dump\u201d for a day and supplement with formula if your GF really needs a \u201cday off\u201d from \u201cadulting\u201d and being impeccably responsible at all times.", "She should pump & dump just to be on the safe side, but she only needs to do it once for a glass of wine.

I get so sick when I'm pregnant that I throw most of those \"you can't do/eat x\" out the window. I need nutrients and if sushi or lunch meat will stay down where other things won't? Eating it. My most recent (and final) pregnancy I was managing a salon 50+ hours per week. Coffee was my best freaking friend. I also have cats and am used to scooping their litter on my own.

MANY women still drink while breastfeeding and have zero issues. Yes, it's a personal choice, but no one should be shamed for it.", "And? I\u2019m breastfeeding and I drink coffee and a two or three cocktails a month. It\u2019s fine.", "Thanks for the images...\"Hmm...where the hell is that damn baby? I know he was around here somewhere. Lemme have another glass of wine and try to remember where I put him...\"\n\nlol", "There\u2019s a lot of quasi science in this info and it\u2019s not quite right. Breast milk is formed in glands (mammary glands) and contains white blood cells. It can have a slightly higher concentration of BA than blood due to its composition and storage time within the lobes. But once it hits the infant stomach you have it\u2019s physiology to contend with: very small infant blood volume, rapid absorption, immature liver, and greater susceptibility to effects of alcohol on the brain due to its composition.\n\n\u201cA few drinks\u201d can suppress rousing, or make the baby irritable. It can change the taste of the breast milk leading to refusal or fussy feeding. A few more can create less responsiveness in the mother. \n\nThe advice above to have one or at the most two just after feeding, then wait 2-3 hours before feeding again is best advice. And to do this irregularly. Otherwise, have a store of expressed breast milk on hand, and pump and dump if you have more than two drinks. And if you\u2019re going to get tuned, make sure someone else has care of the baby for a few hours.", "Whilst human does contain lots of mum's cells,  including White blood cells, and good bacteria\n\nThe majority of it is nutrients namely sugars and fat.", "Yep, I only pump and dump if I\u2019m straight up **drunk**.\n\nIf I\u2019m drinking enough that I couldn\u2019t safely care for an infant then I\u2019m not going to be in a position to feed the kid anyway because a different responsible adult will be doing that. If I\u2019m not drinking enough that I need a babysitter (or sober spouse) to be taking care of my kid, my breast milk is fine.", "Idk this!", "I mean the part when he says that \u00ab\u00a0it could get into the breast milk\u00a0\u00bb is pretty self explanatory, otherwise OP would have said that she is feeding the baby formula\u2026also 1.no one (especially at 24) that misses alcohol and is willing to drink when breastfeeding a child would just take one sip\u20262. No amount is safe it\u2019s something that is very clear, alcohol is so toxic that when it\u2019s ingested the body literally shuts down primary functions to expel it and it causes cancer, it\u2019s not a question of shaming anyone, questioning why anyone would choose to potentially put a child that has no way to consent in harm\u2019s way for something they could literally wait a bit for\u2026is legitimate", "No, you're just supposed to go completely no contact with everyone you have the mildest disagreement with, remember?", "how does a bunch of redditors telling him he\u2019s right help that. it\u2019s not a post asking how he can best explain this stuff isn\u2019t harmful to his in-laws, it\u2019s a post asking if he\u2019s TA", "Most of these posts don\u2019t even have an asshole, just a side we\u2019re meant to disagree with. The word gets thrown around far too much - someone can be the asshole without being in the wrong, and someone can be in the wrong without being an asshole.", "It's the /r/AmItheAsshole way.\n\nIt's fine, if they're anything like my ex-inlaws they're just eyeing you for a kidney transplant.\n\nBut anyways, that's how I became \"/u/grendus three kidneys\".

Really should have gone LC after the extra toe though, makes shopping for gloves a nightmare.", "Because if there is a rationale OP hasn't thought of that might explain his inlaws' reaction, he might reconsider whether he is in the right. People don't know what they don't know, and wise people ask others rather than assume they know everything and are always right. Sometimes it wasn't really necessary, but again, you don't know that until you ask because humans cannot read minds, and sometimes you might feel uncertain even in situations that might seem obvious to other people, especially when you're in the midst of a stressful experience like bringing home a new baby, and especially when the person accusing you is a significant person like your wife's parents. Why do you think you should be the arbiter of what another person should want advice about?", "i have pretty severe anxiety and low self esteem. but if i buy a gift for someone and i know they like it then that\u2019s all that matters. if op seriously thinks he\u2019s an asshole just bc her parents said so despite all that then he needs more therapy than i do\u2026", "Parents probably are a very important peice of his gfs life.

That is such a sweet and thoughtful gift to have waiting for your girl. It is so cool that you are recognizing her as herself and not just as a new mama.

Ignore her parents. \n\nShe can still have a drink when breastfeeding. She just needs to be sensible & do her research. When I was breastfeeding about 12 years ago, it was advised if drinking to wait a certain length of time before breastfeeding & possibly express & dump some milk. But I did read something about your body basically not taking the alcohol into the milk, but I could be wrong on that. Like I said, as long as she knows what she is doing before having a drink, then it's fine.", "So the parents saw the gift and called you uneducated....\n\nBut what does SHE think?", "Even if you\u2019re very drunk, you\u2019re in the 0.08% BAC range.\n\nAlcohol doesn\u2019t concentrate in your breasts.  At worst, your baby\u2019s getting less than 1/10th of a percent alcohol concentration.  That\u2019s less than kambucha or \u201cnonalcoholic\u201d beers.\n\nIt used to be big to give sick babies a tablespoon of whiskey.

That's what my sister did.  Helps with the babies skin.", "She definitely shouldn't pump and dump for a glass of wine. A glass of wine is fine while breastfeeding.  I was advised that if I have a few glasses and am concerned about alcohol content of my milk then I should pump and mix it with other milk to reduce the overall content.", "It's an old thing that used to be done where you pump the breastmilk (using a machine) and then \"dump it\" aka dispose of it.
