Her mother is definitely out of line for insisting something you purchased be thrown away. I don\u2019t know how old she is, but her over the top behavior makes me wonder if something mentally isn\u2019t wrong.  Has she been evaluated for early signs of dementia?  Her threat to not go to your wedding unless you get rid of the wreath is so out of proportion to the issue at hand it sounds like she has some anger issues that can be warning signs of something more serious.\n\nYou suck here because in your own way your response to her demand is also out of proportion to the issue. Yes I know you will get lots of \u201cyour house your rules\u201d responses. But, really?  I just don\u2019t think an Xmas wreath on the door is the place you want to draw a line in the sand that will affect your relationship with your wife\u2019s family for years to come.  And surely you realized when she overreacted so vehemently that something else was wrong. As a takeaway from this experience please learn that the next time this happens you will know it is pointless to try and negotiate or compromise with her.  If you had just said OK fine, taken it down and then put it up again when she left and kept doing this for 3 or 4 weeks, instead of offering that to her, it probably wouldn\u2019t have escalated to this point.\n\nPart of being an adult and especially being a married adult is learning how to pick your battles.  It makes your life much easier.  But seriously, something sure sounds off with your MIL.

Stores? Other peoples houses?  This sounds like a ridiculous excuse to be controlling. If this were really a thing, her son would know about it. NTS", "Verdict: NTA.\n\nYou said it best, OP. Its YOUR home, you and your fiance are allowed to do as you please with it. Her mom, while i understand that she might be going through grief, does not get to dictate what you hang up on your front door.\n\nHell, you even offered to compromise, and she turned that down, which is just ridiculous.", "Naaah they're gutless so they bow down to storms.  Big downside of skeletons for labor.", "NAH. She\u2019s coming over to do you a favour. She can decide no longer to do it. She also doesn\u2019t have to come to your wedding. It\u2019s obviously your house and yours to decorate as you wish so obviously you\u2019re not the asshole.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nMIL's either having a reaction to the wedding (not a good sign) or showing early signs of dementia. \n\nTell her you understand about her not wanting to come and that you'd never force her and then just move on.", "NTA, she needs serious therapy to deal with her trauma. Putting up a wreath is a common tradition. If  taking it down when she's there isn't enough, then that is her problem, celebrate without her, ahe doesn't sound very fun to be around anyways.", "That right there is exactly what points to the whole wreath thing being a manipulation tactic. Don't fall for it. You give in to her demands and this absolutely will not be the last time that she tries to withhold something from you if you don't do what she wants.", "**feeling called out right now**\n\nLoL me too. I make my wreaths and the collection is growing. My goal is ~~world domination~~ having a wreath up pretty much all year round.", "In that case, buy a truckload of wreaths and cover your house, cars, lawn ornaments, and (what the heck) the dog and cat too. NTA.", "*g-wreath counseling", "Seems to be just Christmas that affects her this much however I have never seen her door with any other type of wreath", "My fianc\u00e9 said that because it\u2019s bothering her so much she will probably be really sneaky about it and ask the kids if it\u2019s up any other day. And they won\u2019t lie \ud83d\ude02", "I never thought of this!", "You can make them with so many things. Grape vine is nice and elastic but it always smacks me as I work wreaths and leaves welts. Rude! Willow branches after rain are the best! Nice trick- wired ribbon or twine.  I can't believe how much wreaths go for! $$$"]}
