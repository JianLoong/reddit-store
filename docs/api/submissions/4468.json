Her mother is definitely out of line for insisting something you purchased be thrown away. I don\u2019t know how old she is, but her over the top behavior makes me wonder if something mentally isn\u2019t wrong.  Has she been evaluated for early signs of dementia?  Her threat to not go to your wedding unless you get rid of the wreath is so out of proportion to the issue at hand it sounds like she has some anger issues that can be warning signs of something more serious.\n\nYou suck here because in your own way your response to her demand is also out of proportion to the issue. Yes I know you will get lots of \u201cyour house your rules\u201d responses. But, really?  I just don\u2019t think an Xmas wreath on the door is the place you want to draw a line in the sand that will affect your relationship with your wife\u2019s family for years to come.  And surely you realized when she overreacted so vehemently that something else was wrong. As a takeaway from this experience please learn that the next time this happens you will know it is pointless to try and negotiate or compromise with her.  If you had just said OK fine, taken it down and then put it up again when she left and kept doing this for 3 or 4 weeks, instead of offering that to her, it probably wouldn\u2019t have escalated to this point.\n\nPart of being an adult and especially being a married adult is learning how to pick your battles.  It makes your life much easier.  But seriously, something sure sounds off with your MIL.

Then I might say \"take it down since she asked so nicely\" or \"take it down when she comes over.\" But demanding that other adults do unnecessary things for your comfort in their own home without the fear of mortal peril isn't okay.\n\nIf she's kicking a big enough fit over something so small that she's no longer coming to her daughter's wedding, if say it's pretty important not to set a precedent of negotiating with her. And I'd argue the issue is much less about family and much more about control.", "In lots of cultures, funeral sprays come in wreaths. They just don't come in evergreen wreaths.", "Oh. Then I'll change my vote: If its hard for her to bear right now, live without it and be kind.", "Do you want her at the wedding if you give in now you are signing up for a lifetime of her controlling your life.", ">Yes we were thinking this as we have been waiting it out to see if she calms down but it getting closer and closer to the wedding is leaving us wondering what to do\n\nPlease do not do this. The post you're replying to is the worst advice you'll be given in this discussion.\n\nDo you want your mother-in-law controlling every aspect of your lives using the threat of boycotting major events and refusing to look after your children? Because if you capitulate to this, that's precisely what's going to happen.\n\nI read in your story a rather disturbing aspect about this. She seems justified in boycotting the wedding and refusing to look after your kids if you don't \"respect her wishes.\"\n\nIn your place, I'd ask her to wish in one hand and shit in the other and tell you which hand fills up first. She does not get wishes when it comes to your home! And over a Christmas decoration??? Do you not even see how unbelievably petty this is?\n\nIf you don't want this woman dictating the minute details of your life, then don't throw the wreath away. Once you concede this, then she'll be dictating even the tiniest aspects of your life, with the threat of refusing to attend major events and taking care of your kids, because you refuse to drink your coffee with cream instead of milk.", "Would i be a bad person to suggest you just give her lip service? If you tell her you threw it away and then just like... didnt. And made sure to take it down when she came over. \n\nI went through a period where I had issues where a lot of shit would trigger me. My roommates would hang out with my ex. So I just told them not to tell me when they did. What I dont know cant hurt me. I get its different because she didn't ask you but like... this way your kids get to have it up and she isn't hurt by seeing it.", "Would i be a bad person to suggest you just give her lip service?

She is the AH for attempting to control how you and your fiancee decorate your home for Christmas. If she doesn't wish to attend wedding over a wreath she doesn't have to. Now keep her dislike of wreaths in your back pocket. It's apparently her kryptonite.", "I'd decorate the wedding and reception with wreathes, but I'm petty and it's Christmas time.", "He died 28 years ago. I would definitely have taken it down, not even bought it if it was recent but it was along time ago.", "This is an excellent idea.\n\n Encourage Grandma to share her own family history and  memories with her grandchildren. A priceless gift for her grandchildren would be knowing more of their family history and a tradition of doing the wreath with her. \n\nToys come and go - a story about their great great grandfather will pass to their own grandchildren. He won't be forgotten.", "I would have done this however if our daughter saw the door without the wreath she would be very upset and would probably tell my MIl it\u2019s hidden if we explained it to her   \ud83d\ude02", "Does she freak out when she sees them in public too? Does she refuse to shop at stores that sell them? If not, she's just being an ass.", "Then, NTA. Your MIL does not get to prevent your children from decorating and having happy childhood memories because she hasn't properly processed the non-wreath-related death of her father almost thirty years ago.", "NTA.\n\n28 years ago?  She is waAAAAy too controlling.   How does she handle seeing wreaths elsewhere, yet is somehow grief-stricken when seeing them on OPs door?", "No from what I\u2019ve been told  she doesn\u2019t have a freak out when she sees them around", "Can you offer to have her hang one on your door with your family every year? To pass the tradition along? Unless your fiance thinks that'll make things worse.", "I think this is a great idea, allow our kids to have that same memory with their grandmother. I\u2019ll put it forwards to my fianc\u00e9"]}
