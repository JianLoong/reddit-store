He got extremely angry and started yelling and cursing at me, followed me outside, in my face, telling me my son is worthless and will never amount to anything, he needs to grow up and be a man. I go get my son, and stay at my house instead of going back to BF's  house. \n\nThe next day, we were all supposed to go have lunch with my dad. My son and I go, but I didn't take my BF because of his behavior the night before. BF continues drinking, goes to a friend's house (friend is on parole and also an alcoholic) and gets a huge, poorly done tattoo on his forearm. His birthyear in Roman numerals. Except the numbers are wrong because both of them are drunk. The lines aren't straight and nothing is the same size or even. I hate it because it's a permanent reminder of his temper tantrum over me helping my son, and I'm embarrassed to have my family see it, because I feel it makes my BF look like a stupid redneck. AITA for being upset about it and wanting him to have it removed? \n\nFootnote: he was furious at me for helping my son, who he feels should be able to help himself, but felt it was perfectly fine to go to his ex's house when she called him at 4:30 am because her dog died.", "created_utc": 1690835596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15er8bh/aita_for_being_upset_and_embarrassed_by_my/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
