Some cats are very social, they love people and needs to be around. And yes, you do need to teach them some manners but I would have removed the cat by holding him or by putting him in another part of my home, IF my cat had previously been trained to stay a few hours in a closed space with a window. For example, my two current cats are used to me sleeping in my bedroom by myself. They don't cry, until my alarm goes off in the morning. They don't jump up on my kitchen table while I'm eating, and I simply used a stop sign, no harsh words or anything else to teach them. Once I'm done eating or sleeping, they're allowed to go all over my apartment.\n\nIn your case, your cat is still new, he loves people and your guests needs to be able to accept him.

Part of being a good pet owner is to ensure your animal is not a nuisance.
