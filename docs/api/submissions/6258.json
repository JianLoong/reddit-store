For example, my two current cats are used to me sleeping in my bedroom by myself. They don't cry, until my alarm goes off in the morning.

I would never try to \u201cteach them a lesson\u201d or say anything to my mother in law.  I vote ESH the mother in law was rude but OP should understand not everyone wants cats rubbing all over them.", "I'll say NTA because your MIL was being rude and aggressive in your home.  She was acting like she owned the place and had power over it, you, and your cat.  If she felt nervous or upset about the cat she should have spoken to you. Instead she took the  passive aggressive route of talking to the cat and threatening to lock it up.", "The MIL is 60 - do you know any 60 year olds who like trip hazards? You are aware that falling as an older person is not comparable to falling when your younger?\n\nYou love your pet - get over it and train the pet for its own protection.

Like you said it's the cats home not hers", "I have a golden retriever who loves attention and will sit in front of people until they pet her (sometimes drops her head in their lap and just looks up expectantly). As a host, unless my guests already know my dog and are fine with her wanting to be around them constantly, I put her in a baby gated part of my house. \n\nNot everyone loves animals/some people are really allergic.

That being said, your response of \u201cyou\u2019re acting like a child\u201d makes it personal and escalates the situation. Firmly setting boundaries is good, but you could have been more respectful with the way you did it.\n\nAlso, if the cat was rubbing against her too much couldn\u2019t you or your bf just hold the cat? That way she isn\u2019t locked up and gets to be around everyone.", "NTA Guest do not get to lock pets up. Hard stop. You could offer if she was polite but to me this seems like it was a power play since her son recently moved out. Fuck that noise.", "I\u2019m gonna get dragged for this, but NTA. If all the cat was doing was rubbing against her leg, she should\u2019ve taken it as a compliment because that\u2019s how cats show love and sniff out a person to make sure they are safe. I\u2019m assuming a lot of people in this thread are not cat owners, but as an owner I too would tell someone to fuck off if they pushed my cats. If the cat was clawing at her or biting her legs it would be different. It\u2019s the cats house too and they have the right to sniff out guests and see if they can maybe get some pets. Good for you for defending your baby.", "MIL was over the top, but your cat needs to chill out and you need to teach it some boundaries. No one wants your cat all over them. YTA.", "There are some parents and pet owners who don't understand that just because they enjoy the constant contact with their child/pet, others do not. Just like a human child, you have to train a pet to not have unwanted physical contact (or at least attempt to.)\n\nI have a dog allergy. I don't hang out with some friend's anymore because they cannot comprehend that just because their dog is adorable and friendly, that doesn't mean that I want to have them all over me. Big dogs also scare me due to childhood trauma and one friend thought it was funny to have their very large \"puppy\" go 'play' with me - aka their friend who is allergic and scared. I respect that it is the animals home, so I simply decline invites - which some pet owners also do not take kindly to.", "Does nobody in this comment section know how to handle cats? \n\nAight. Look. First of all, this is a kitten, unless I missed something. Most kittens are still very into seeking warmth and attention. Hence the leg-rubbing. If you want a sweet, cuddly adult cat, you love on that kitten. Most times, you'll get a loving adult.\n\nKittens also are very reactive to certain sounds, the same that their mom would make. Either a growling meow or a hiss. Make either noise at any cat 8 months old or younger, you're going to scare it. So...only use it sparingly, like their mama. She uses it for \"you are about to get killed\", or \"I'm going to swat you across the room if you don't cut it out\". Older cats brought up this way know that noise; they freeze in place, stop whatever they're doing, and run for their safe place. Simply yelling at a cat does not work. They don't understand, and just think you're being horrible. \n\nSafe place: they need one. A place they can hide when the giant food dispensers (humans) are being terrifying. Something just big enough to fit, preferably soft, preferably warm. Once they get there, no matter how pissed off you are, you *leave them alone*. Cats are not stupid. Caught one pissing on my bathroom floor two days ago, hissed at him all around the house till he got to his safe place. He's still upset and trying to apologize. So am I; this is very out of character, need to figure out why. Have to take him to the vet. Cats don't just suddenly pee in the wrong place for no reason. Usually means a health problem. Or a psych one; unhappy cats can't tell you with words, so that's how they communicate.\n\nAlso, unless it's dark, a cat whose pupils are fully dilated is a cat that is about to attack. Don't stare straight into their eyes, that's a challenge. No need to establish who's bigger. They know already. If they're pissed off enough to have fully dilated pupils, they do not care how big you are. Squint a bit, that's how they signal that they don't want to fight. Don't try to touch them. Squint, look away, squint again, make a purring noise (even a low pitched hum will do). If the cat is still pissed? Remove yourself from the situation and let it calm down. \n\nNo shame in this. Just respect for the cat. If you were angry enough to want to do damage, you'd prefer that the cause got out of your sight too.\n\nAnd a cat the half-closes their eyes? Is saying they like, love, trust you. Half close yours, and you will make a friend.", "I would agree, except MIL never made it known she didn't want the cat rubbing up on her until she angrily pushed him away and threatened to lock him in the bathroom. \n\nAt that point, OP was rightfully more concerned with MIL's aggressive behavior than with the cuddly kitten. I don't think she's TA for responding accordingly.\n\nIf MIL had let them know she doesn't like cats beforehand (since she knew ahead of time they had a cat), or if she had requested at any point the cat be kept away from her, she probably would have gotten a kinder response. Even the BF could have preempted this by warning OP about is mom's dislike of cats. But OP didn't know, so why should she be expected to react kindly to an uncommunicative guest who threatens and shoves her pet?", "Exactly this.

One of them cries through the window at me every time I'm doing yard work. Is it gut wrenching to listen to them cry? Of course.
