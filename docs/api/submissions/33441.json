There is my family of 4, my parents, my grandmother, my aunt and uncle, their two kids and families. We all live in the same area and will do whatever we can to help eachother.\n\nMy cousin, Derek(28m) tragically passed away a year and a half ago from a drunk driver. He left behind his wife, Monica(27f) and 4 kids, all under the age of 8. It was devastating and Monica completely shut down. We all understood and started caring for her and the kids. This included me no longer charging her rent(they lived in a house I own, next door to me), helping prepare meals, taking care of the kids, helping with appointments, school work, shopping, ect. I can't tell you how many times I was her shoulder to cry on. She let me put the kids in therapy but refused to go herself.\n\nOn to the now and the issue. As I said, it's been a year and a half... and she is still completely shut down. She doesn't work, she doesn't cook or clean, and I have been raising the kids along with my 2. This isn't sustainable. The kids miss her. They lost their mom the day they lost their dad.\n\nI sat her down the other night and was trying to be empathetic towards her but nothing was getting thru. She just kept crying and saying she couldn't do it without Derek. I told her she doesn't have a choice. She has 4 kids who need their mother. She still wasn't listening but I had enough. I told her she has a week to get an appointment with a therapist before I stop supporting her and went for custody of the kids. She ran out crying. \n\nThe rest of our family thinks I'm being cruel because she loved my cousin deeply but I think this is what she needs. She can't live like this and can't keep putting her kids thru this!", "created_utc": 1703102396, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18n3ox6/aita_for_telling_my_cousins_widow_i_will_no/", "score": 3348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019ve given it a year and a half and whilst there is no time limit on grief, she needs a reality check. You\u2019ve not said anything crazy, just go see a therapist at least. You\u2019ve already tried that, and it didn\u2019t work. You gave it time, but now\u2019s the time for an ultimatum. Her kids need her now. Where are all of the rest of the families help?", "NTA \n\nYou making her go see a therapist makes sense. Plus, it is not only about her, but about her kids who need her. She needs to reconstruct, but you need her to play a real part in the project. You have done loads for her and her kids - but please don't let the kids down if the mother fails to have therapy.", "NTA\n\nOne and half years is a lot of time to support someone. I understand people try to grieve in different ways and your cousin's widow is still struggling. But sooner or later she has to start caring for her children and for that she needs to get therapy. \n\nYou are not withholding support completely. It is time for you to behave in the best interests of the children. \n\nYou are just showing some tough love. And one day I hope she appreciates it.", "NTA\n\nSince it's a tight knit family and they disagree with your approach, they all can step up and take care of the 4 kids and start paying her rent.  I mean they don't want to be AH's do they?  It's easy to call you an AH when you do everything.  It's very sad what occurred, but 1 1/2 years later is not \"rushing\" this.  With her shut down, she has to decide what she is going to do for those children which should be THE MOST important thing.  Tough love is tough, but this situation is not your fault and she is not helping but sticking her head in the sand.  Good luck to you and the children and ultimately your SIL.", "Hi, death care professional here!\n\nBeing stuck in the mourning (which is how your grief is outwardly displayed) is very difficult.  And grief (the emotions surrounding a loss) can often mask depression...  The two play off each other as well and have lots of similarities.  It's common for one to flow into the other.\n\nSomething that might help (in addition to therapy) is to set and enforce obtainable goals.  Easy goals to start.  When you're deep in the malaise it can be difficult to accept that you can in fact accomplish things.  Everything can seem overwhelming.  Explain to her that you know this is hard and you will continue to be there for her.  But hard doesn't mean impossible and living means continuing on.\n\nShe's alive, her kids are alive, and they need to live well because that's exactly what she and her husband (bless him) planned out for themselves prior to his death.  That plan doesn't stop/end just because he isn't here physically to help her with it.\n\nSo, first goal.  Get out of bed each morning to say \"good morning\" to the kids.  She doesn't need to shower, she doesn't need to help with breakfast, she simply needs to get up on time each day to start the day with her family.  That's it.\n\nAnd then when that's easier, she says good morning and makes breakfast for the kids.\n\nAnd then when that's easier, she showers, gets dressed, says good morning, and makes breakfast for the kids.\n\nRoutine after loss is its own kind of therapy.  For everyone.  This may seem silly but she's in it deep.  So give her baby steps.  Encourage therapy.  Encourage the baby steps.  These are acceptable boundaries for your own mental/emotional well-being as well as that of her children.\n\nHelping someone after a death isn't always cooking, cleaning, or being a shoulder to cry on.  A lot of the time it's enforcing boundaries and holding people accountable for their actions (or inactions).  That doesn't mean she isn't allowed to continue mourning or grieving...  It means she needs to continue to live through those things and find healthy ways to adjust to his absence.  And it isn't punitive.\n\nThese things are for you just as much as they are for her and her children.  You seem incredibly compassionate but it's healthy to set expectations and boundaries when caring for someone.  Therapy can help her find the tools to process the loss in a healthy way but baby steps can help you have tools for this family going forward too.  They're just different types of tools.  And hopefully your tools will get her to start each day by saying \"good morning\".", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019ll thank you once she\u2019s on the other side of all of this:)", ">The rest of our family thinks I'm being cruel because she loved my cousin deeply but I think this is what she needs.\n\nThen where are they with the rent payments and virtually 24 hour care of the four kids? \n\nNTA. You have been more than supportive and understanding. And you're not even unilaterally cutting off your support; you're just making the ultimatum that she needs to get therapy, which is something she should have done a year and a half ago.", "NTA she\u2019s very lucky that you\u2019ve been able to support a family of 5 for this long, many wouldn\u2019t have that support. You may need to make the appointment for her, ask around and try to find someone who specializes in grief counseling and get her in asap. Tbh it sounds like she\u2019s almost at the level of benefiting from an inpatient stay to get her stabilized. Do you know if she\u2019s doing ADL\u2019s or getting out of bed?", "NTA. You did and are doing the right thing. She needs therapy, should have been this whole time, and she needs to be a Mother again. Your family sounds like they're enabling her. Has she developed a drink or substance abuse issue? I ask because it happens to the surviving spouse often when a tragedy like this occurs. I saw it in my own family. And everyone enabled that person to no end, until they ended up with ulcers and DTs. If she is neglectful and mentally incapable of caring for her children physically and emotionally, you or someone needs to take custody. You'll get their payments from the Fed which will cover about 1/4-1/2 each of their individual financial needs. The rest will have to come out of your pocket, so custody is a big step. Good luck.", "NTA you have been more than gracious and helpful.  Her situation is tragic, however no matter how she grieves, she has 4 children to take care of and she seems more than content to let everyone else do it.  You're doing what is best for those kids.", "You are not being cruel.  She needs to move forward, and she's not doing it.  You are helping her.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You spoke truth and was not malicious. Those who disagree with your approach can step up and take over duties you do on the daily.\n\nYou are not cruel. She can love your cousin deeply but he is not here and she must create positive change no matter how small. Best to you!", "NTA...A year and a half is a long time.  Something has to change and it's not like you haven't been generous and understanding.", "She needed a wake-up call, and you gave her one. Let's hope she takes advantage of it.

You have let her check out for to long. Letting someone live rent free for over a year and a half is a lot. Probably too much.", "NTA\n\nYouve been brilliant and done a lot.\n\nShe needs some tough love, she needs to snap out of it and start acting like she has a family to support.", "NTA - Those kids need a functioning parent.  \n\nIf the rest of the family feels this is too cruel they should start paying the rent  and providing daily childcare and housekeeping services.  It\u2019s easy for them to judge when they aren\u2019t carrying most of the burden.", "NTA, everyone grieves in their own way and time. But she needs to step up for her kids. She needs therapy to help get thru this and if she isn\u2019t willing to try the. The kids would be better with you. She isn\u2019t emotionally stable. Hopefully therapy can help her.", "NTA\n\nI lost my husband to cancer 4 years ago. You have to pick yourself up and move on. Apologies, but providing that level of support for a year and a half is probably contributing to your SIL not recovering.\n\nDuty and taking care of your responsibilities, like children, gives you the strength to carry on. It is a tough situation, but if you don\u2019t make her start taking care of her family, you are encouraging her to not recover.", "NTA. & anyone that tells you that you are, send them an itemized list of all the shit you pay for, all the running around you do, & how much her rent is monthly & tell them how grateful you are that they\u2019re offering to take over completely for you since you\u2019re so cruel & see how quickly they shut the fuck up", "NAH.\n\nMonica is clearly suffering from depression and trauma, and needs help -- it may be near impossible for her to fully realize this in the course of a single conversation \"wake up call.\"\n\nYou're NTA for wanting to make sure she can get help, be financially and emotionally stable for herself and the kids.\n\nUltimatums are challenging. You're not wrong for wanting her to self support, but you may need to give her a list of therapists who deal with trauma/loss of loved ones who are available and taking new patients, and even driving her to the appointment. With a bit of compassion and gentle pushing (vs. a hard shove), she might be able to start turning the gears to get help. Depriving four small children of their mother after losing their father would hardly be the best outcome for all concerned, especially and including you.   \n\n\nEDIT: It does sound like OP has offered to drive to therapy, pay for it etc. I would suggest OP actually make an appointment with a family counselor, which includes her/Monica and eventually the kids, and start the gears. Someone this depressed and basically unwilling to live might actually need someone to force the beginning of changes.", "Grief is normal- 2 years of severe grief is normal for loss of a spouse. It would only be the 6-12 month mark that she\u2019d be reasonable to see a therapist. Yes, it\u2019s excessive that she\u2019s done nothing for her kids that long, but when I did psych, I had to assess way too many people marched in by loved ones a few days post loss and we had to explain grief isn\u2019t a mental illness. There is a phenomenon called pathological grief, and she likely does fit that diagnosis, but sudden death of a young person is really hard to process, and I speak as someone whose parent died at a youngish age in a similar way.   \n\n\nShe has been fortunate to have the support she has had, and it\u2019s unreasonable to expect it to continue. I\u2019m not against OP, she\u2019s done above and beyond, and it\u2019s likely doing the widow no favours allowing her to continue to do nothing job and children wise. However, I just wanted to say, in response to some comments that grief, particularly post sudden death, takes a lot longer than the non-bereaved realise. It\u2019s not just the loss of her partner, her future and that of her children has been torn away. She may have ptsd from the accident, even if not present.", "NTA - she should be strong for her kids and suffer when there is time, not abandon them when they need her most. she chose to have kids, she has a duty to them thats been severly neglected.\n\nif being nice didnt push her out of the comfort zone of her own misery, maybe some tough love will. you are a hero op", "Nta you tried to be nice and it didn\u2019t work, now you\u2019re doing something different, she needs the change.", "NTA - looking out for their best interests", "NTA - and you would be the AH if you continued to enable her in her avoidance. \n\nMost people wouldn\u2019t have the luxury that she has had, of no responsibilities for 18 months.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to get out of her depression and she needs help with that.

I'm gonn tell you it's not and she is going through hell right now. \nBut you're NTA. It's your time, your money, you have the right to decide what to do with them. This woman, however, needs a professional help, peace of mind and time to get back on her feet. A year and a half seems like yesterday for her. That's just devastating and she is lost right now.", "Has she filed for SS benefits for the kids?", ">I told her she has a week to get an appointment with a therapist before I stop supporting her and went for custody of the kids\n\nINFO\n\nA week to call around and schedule an appointment, or to physically BE at an appointment with a therapist? You're aware it can take months to get into a new patient intake appointment, right?\n\nIf she gets the appointment scheduled, then what's the timeline?", "NAH. Grief like this can sometimes continue for three to four years and the second year is often worse. That said she *does* need therapy so she can start to process it in a more healthy manner - if she is employing unhealthy coping mechanisms it is going to be very hard for her to come out of those coping mechanisms. \n\nShe is walking around with a gigantic emotional wound, half of her ripped open and her mental state is hemorrhaging. It takes a lot of care to start to heal that, properly - you can heal on your own but sometimes it doesn\u2019t heal right and it\u2019s always safer to have proper first aid. A therapist would be able to provide that - to help her start to process, to disinfect it so to speak, and to set her up with the right coping mechanisms and help to show her how to fix the wound, so to speak. \n\nBut you absolutely need to continue to support her until she gets into therapy. That ultimatum is necessary - get into therapy, period. But support her regardless. Talk to her for long periods whenever you get the chance even if she doesn\u2019t seem interested.\n\nRemind her that she is not a bad person for suffering. That she is not a bad person for being here when he isn\u2019t. That she isn\u2019t a bad person for needing time, or struggling, or being unable to do the things she used to, or for healing, or for feeling happiness sometimes if she experiences something nice. It isn\u2019t her fault this happened and she deserves to heal and be happy. Being happy isn\u2019t disrespectful to him, it isn\u2019t a lack of loyalty or faith, moving on isn\u2019t disregarding him, her future still has good things in it and if she honours him in her memory in whatever way she feels is best she will never let him down or be less faithful or loving or respectful. \n\nDeath is awful; it rips away from us what we care about most. We are not built for loss and every loss hurts us, especially when it is something that cannot be replaced. Death is a thief and she has been stolen from. It is not her place to make herself suffer for having lost someone she loves so much. She does need that therapist badly to help her figure out how to stand on her own again as right now she is hobbling without a clue how to look up at where she is going rather than at her own feet. \n\nDon\u2019t let her get away with not going but don\u2019t hold your support as conditional. In her mindset she is liable to assume it means that you have given up on her, that it is a foregone conclusion, that she isn\u2019t worth your support, that she somehow owes you and somehow hasn\u2019t paid you back. Don\u2019t even mention what the alternative is. Present it as there not being an alternative. \n\n\u201cI am going to help you find a therapist by next week. Which of these therapists sound more approachable? Do you have any preferences in gender?\u201d \u201cI am going to help you schedule the appointment now.

It also allows her to consent to you taking on the hard work she may not be prepared to do yet and may not know how to ask for or accept help with. If you say it like it is going to happen regardless she is more likely to go along with it - this works with most people.

She's had 18 months to grieve, now it's time to get her shit together and start being a mother to those poor kids.

OP thought he could get her to step up by telling her the life-line is leaving.  OP can see that is not going to work now.  \n\nMaybe it would help for the family to contact a grief counselor and get professional advice on how to help her to move forward out of this grief - and exactly what is helpful and what is not.\n\nI feel like there's a game of Russian Roulette happening here and she is the one holding the gun.  This woman could go seriously over the edge now.

She obviously isn't able to get herself out of her depression and I'm not sure if regular therapy appointments will be enough. She's still very early in her journey and she might not always go to her appointments (she didn't do anything for so long, she probably doesn't have the energy). A hospital stay has the benefits of having professionals all around her and going to therapy is just going to the room next door. She'll also see that she isn't alone in her struggles. Plus you can take a break.\n\nI'd seriously recommend a hospital stay from personal experience. And for the germans on this thread: The Filderklinik is great. They helped me tremendously. The food they served was pretty good too.", "I want to preface this by letting it be clear that you're NTA. Sure really needs to snap out of it, for both her and her college sake.\nHowever, could I suggest that either you or someone else in the family sets up the appointment (with her being present so she is part of it) for her?  It might not be the case for Monica, but I know I really needed that to kickstart my recovery. Deeply depressed brains are stunted, and the will to better the situation pretty much disappears. Whenever my mind was less cloudy, I would ask my partner to force me to go, because I knew I had to, I just couldn't.", "NAH. I think what you have done is the best thing for everyone. As you said, this isn't sustainable. I cannot imagine losing my partner, it would truly be heartbreaking. But you have already given her 1.5 years for her to begin to work on her future. It isn't fair on her children, not on you. It also it's fair on her, but she is the only one who can address her situation. There is a saying I use in therapy, which is the \"people may not have caused all of their own problems, but they have the responsibility to solve them anyway\". While this isn't a perfect fit with grief, it is important to acknowledge that she has the responsibility to begin her healing process.\n\nAlso, I don't see you going for custody as a permanent thing. At the moment, given the current situation, yes, it seems to be the best thing. But if you have to go ahead with this plan, and she later seeks helps, and works on herself, there is nothing stopping a transition back to their mother in the future as appropriate. My only point is that getting in to see a therapist in a week may be unrealisitic, but I see in other comments you mentioned the week is to book a session, not to attend one, which is great.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss and that you have to take this all on. All the best.", "NTA,but\u2026.When you approached her with this convo, you gave her little to no time to get herself together. You are absolutely right in that it\u2019s time for her to start planning the rest of her life. Help her develop that plan. Set goals with a reasonable timeframe. Find a grief group for her and enlist the services of a life coach. My sister went through a similar situation. I\u2019ve never seen such a happy, go lucky person, crushed by the untimely loss of her spouse. It was heart wrenching and she was States away from family. Mom and Dad moved in with her and helped her learn to manage her daily routines. Everything from finances, taxes, insurance, managing a huge house as a single woman.

Not the A H for drawing a line, but maybe the A H for the sudden change and the potentially unreasonable timeline. She is severely depressed enough that I wouldn\u2019t expect her to be able to meet that deadline at all in the US, but even elsewhere I think she could reasonably be expected to need some practical support with the administrative side of what you\u2019re asking.

I hope you NEVER feel the hell that is like that! And you going in there telling her you are going to take her kids away? Really? I bet you are \"supporting\" her from afar. It would be better if you and the rest go in and actually HELP her get it together, SHOW her by physically being there to help her and stop sitting around judging her, cause that is what you and the rest are doing! She is not just \"going to get over it\"...SHOW her instead of lecturing her! And stop threatening her! In my situation, my aunt came to my moms and we talked for days, she finally convinced me to get up, get dressed and we had to go over to my house and deal with things. My youngest daughter missed 67 days of school because I could not bear to be alone. I held her and cried all the time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There is my family of 4, my parents, my grandmother, my aunt and uncle, their two kids and families. We all live in the same area and will do whatever we can to help eachother.\n\nMy cousin, Derek(28m) tragically passed away a year and a half ago from a drunk driver. He left behind his wife, Monica(27f) and 4 kids, all under the age of 8. It was devastating and Monica completely shut down. We all understood and started caring for her and the kids. This included me no longer charging her rent(they lived in a house I own, next door to me), helping prepare meals, taking care of the kids, helping with appointments, school work, shopping, ect. I can't tell you how many times I was her shoulder to cry on. She let me put the kids in therapy but refused to go herself.\n\nOn to the now and the issue. As I said, it's been a year and a half... and she is still completely shut down. She doesn't work, she doesn't cook or clean, and I have been raising the kids along with my 2. This isn't sustainable. The kids miss her. They lost their mom the day they lost their dad.\n\nI sat her down the other night and was trying to be empathetic towards her but nothing was getting thru. She just kept crying and saying she couldn't do it without Derek. I told her she doesn't have a choice. She has 4 kids who need their mother. She still wasn't listening but I had enough. I told her she has a week to get an appointment with a therapist before I stop supporting her and went for custody of the kids. She ran out crying. \n\nThe rest of our family thinks I'm being cruel because she loved my cousin deeply but I think this is what she needs. She can't live like this and can't keep putting her kids thru this!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she does get into therapy, I would talk to her about a plan to step back your help in phases until your involvement gets to a place you can live with, and whatever that looks like is up to you. For example, if your family was relying on the rental income previously, you should not have to continue to go without it and she needs to agree to a plan to start paying by X date.\n\nAnd anyone who thinks you're cruel needs to put their time and money where their mouth is.

YTA big time\n\nI'm gonna preface this by saying I lost my dad a little over two years ago, and I've been staying at home to help my mom. We've also had two family friends lose their husbands in the past two years. So I'm coming from a place of knowledge and experience that you don't have. \n\nI know you lost your cousin, but losing your husband is an entirely different creature. Like I said, I lost my dad, and tbh? My grief is so much different from my mom's, which you wouldn't think since losing a parent and losing your spouse are both up there on grief scale. I'd say a parent losing their child is about the only thing worse. \n\nMy mom only gets out of bed because of me, and I'm almost 30. Plus it's been almost two years. She still clearly feels that way. One of our family friends who lost her husband told my mom the only reason she gets out of bed is to take care of her profoundly autistic son. My mom and the two family friends who lost their husbands have all said in one form or another they've thought about offing themselves. Hell, my mom has told me as much, that if it weren't for me, she would have done away with herself. (Sorry for not using the s word directly, idk what the policy is on here. But I'm also not a child so, you know, I'm not gonna type things like sewer slide).\n\nI'm going to be completely honest. There are days I don't even know the person my mom is now. She used to be kind and empathic and a good person. Now? A wrong look can make her hate you for weeks, and she'll wish every manner of ill will upon you. \n\nYour cousin's wife is no doubt feeling the same way. And that's not even touching on the grief and pain she has to feel knowing her kids are going to grow up without their father. Or the fact she has to watch her children, all young children, grieve their dad. Like idk about you, but if my father died before I was 8? There'd be no amount of therapy in the world that could fix me. Hell, as I said before, I'm almost 30, and I'm pretty sure there's no therapy that can fix me after watching my dad die. And I have the words and abilities to express what I'm feeling! They're young kids, they don't have that. \n\nLook. I understand you mean well and want to help her, but cutting her off is not the solution. You're basically making a traumatic situation worse for her. Best case? She makes it, but it takes her so much longer, and she becomes even more bitter and jaded. Worst case? Those four kids don't have a mommy or a daddy. Which if that happens, I'm not blaming you because ultimately, she decides if she lives or if she dies. I'm just preparing you for the worst case scenario.\n\nIf I'm being brutally honest? I think you're just uncomfortable with how she\u2019s grieving, and you want to make her stop. You want to make her either conform to how you think she should grieve or you want her to do it in private so it doesn't bother you. This isn't about her; this is about you and you being uncomfortable with grief.

Ive been there, done that, albeit 10 years older and half the kids.\nMy first instinct was always the kids. My VERY FIEST THOUGHT was \"I will have to tell the kids. It will break them\" (Spoiler: It didnt, because I made sure they were smothered with love those first days, including but not limited to, having My parents zoom over to us and holding a kid each when breaking the news).\n\nIve seen it on Reddit before,  and I will always say this: When you have kids, you CAN NOT break completely, unless you decide to check out of the parenting role.\nIm sorry to say that you/family probably have enabled her in her grief, and that she needed this \"tough love\" a lot earlier in the process. In my opinion and experience, help is needed until the funeral, then scaled down. You could have offered for them to join your dinners, and childcare while she was working. 4 littke kids as a single  mom is A LOT. But her completely checking out is probably a combination of denial (I cant have lost My old life!), overwhelm (Doing anything requires you to have a foundation to base decisions on, and her world has ended/she hasnt adjusted), enablement (She did not have external pressure to adjust) and, as a result, she has not been able to reach all the stages of grief. Grief is not linear, and it is usual to cycle through the stages of grief, but getting stuck in the early stages is unhealthy and inhibits any growth. I get the need to \"hold on\", and \"get stuck\" to be close to a loved one, but there is no need to \"let go\" or \"move on\", but there IS a need to process the information and adjust to the new realities.\n\n\nMoving forward, Id encourage you to think about your role. What can you offer? What would benefit her, and in turn her children? \n\nThen Id encourage another sit down with her. Be clear, that you care. Be clear, that she is deling with complicated grief, which is an illness and can be treated. Be VERY clear, that she will not lose her husband by processing her grief. He will ALWAYS be with her, in her heart, in her children - and the more she processes, the more she will feel him.  He would not, if pressed,  want her to be dead while still living, and for their children to lose both parents.\n\nThen tell her what you are able to offer. \nReduced rent?\nChildcare?\nMeals?\nHelping her find the support she and her children are eligible for? (Survivors benefits etc)\nHelp with budgeting?\nCarpooling to school?\nA schedule for \"Who does what when\"?\n\nShe needs to \"return to life\" step by step, she needs pushed forward, she needs to be held accountable.\n\nMaybe she would also benefit from a \"grief group\"? One, where she would meet others in the same situation, and learn how they cope, process and adjust. One where she realizes, that she is not the only one who suffered a loss, and that sometimes - sh*t happens, but life doesent stop there.\n\n\n\nSending you a lot of love.", "NTA, if she takes your warning seriously she will be thanking you later.
