You even reminded him to pick your brother up and he still didn't do it.  He's TA.", "Absolutely NTA. If it was truly an accident, your BF should have been far more apologetic and appalled at his lapse. But he wasn't, and that has frankly made me doubt how accidental it really was. A young man aged 16, likely in school full time and working weekdays until 10pm needs support and you're awesome for providing that for him. Your BF was an AH for agreeing to help out ONCE, failing to do so, and then acting like you are wrong for caring. Facepalm.", "NTA. Ditching your brother when he was supposed to pick him up is a big deal, regardless of how old your brother is. It's just a dick move. What else is he going to \"forget\" in the future?", "NTA\n\nNever have kids with that guy", "NTA. He has taught you that you can\u2019t trust him, so take careful note of that as you\u2019re thinking about your future.", "NTA\n\nsounds like you are heaps more mature than your bf and that probably won\u2019t change. Sure, you\u2019re brother was fine, but that\u2019s also not the point. You asked him to do one thing for you which he said he would then he went and got drunk instead.", "NTA- he agreed to do something and didn\u2019t do it. You are entitled to your feelings about it.", "NTA he agreed to pick up your brother and conveniently forgot when something better came up. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because nothing happened\u201d Is not a good enough defence.", "NTA.  The time to say that you were being overprotective would have been before he agreed to do it.", "NTA at all. I would literally never trust that dude again.", "NTA, he made a commitment and didn\u2019t do it. The underlying reason for him to do it in the first place was for the safety of your family member. You should seriously consider your relationship with a man who would selfishly put his desire to go drinking with his buddies over the safety of your brother, after he promised he would do that", "NTA. How can it not be his fault if he forgot? Still his fault. The way he responded makes it seem like he just didn't want to do it. Doesn't seem like a trustworthy person.", "NTA. He agreed to do something and then refused to do it.\n\nIt's very telling that he thinks you're overprotective of your brother. Due to that, along with his attitude after the fact. I'm of the opinion that he chose to do this deliberately to force your brother to get the bus.\n\nThat's a really, really big red flag OP. Good luck.", "NTA he is a huge th. Even ofnhe couldn't drive he atleast should have called an ubder or a taxi for Keeping his word.\n\nYour bigger problem is that his word os worth shit. Are you going to trust him with bigger things?", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you\u2019re overprotective; he\u2019s saying that to skirt the issue. The issue is that he promised to pick your brother up, and he DIDN\u2019T. If I\u2019d forgotten something like that, I\u2019d be losing my mind over it. But instead of apologizing he doubled down on his own mistake and said it wasn\u2019t his fault?!?!? He\u2019s seriously a bad boyfriend for this.", "NTA, whether anything happened to your brother has nothing to do with it. He promised he'd do something for you and then failed to do it, and then lied and said he forgot to avoid taking responsibility. And frankly I'd be far more worried about that behavior than just not picking your brother up. First of all even if he did forget he'd owe you an apology, but secondly he didn't forget, you reminded him twice, he just didn't do it. That he'd rather lie to your face and specifically to give you a reason why he doesn't have to apologize to you is pretty fucked.", "NTA", "NTA. The issue is he agreed to something and didn\u2019t do it.", "NTA. Even if  your brother was perfectly fine from take the bus (which he was) it still comes down to personal responsibility on your bf\u2019s part. He agreed to do it, was reminded a few times about it, and he just all of a sudden forgot and stated drinking. I\u2019m throwing it out there\u2026.he never intended to pick your brother up and figured you\u2019d never find out he took the bus. You have every right to make upset about it", "NTA Because he promised and even with reminders he forgot. \"Too drunk\" is a situation to call an Uber and fix your mistake--and he didn't even do that.\n\nBut OP your brother is 16 and he isn't helpless. It does sound like you could be being a bit overprotective as well? That doesn't change bf dropping the ball, but it's something to look out for in the future. Keep in mind at bros age the focus should be less \"protect\" and more \"prepare for the future.\"", "NTA, and hes testing boundaries imo. I try not to be on the \"dump them\" train, but this is so standard manipulation that I don't think you really have a choice. You can't trust him again. Not really. You know he did it on purpose, and he knows you know.", "NTA - the fact that your boyfriend thinks so little of breaking a commitment - let alone one that was specifically made to protect someone\u2019s safety- is alarming. His disregard for the people you care about and are responsible for should be a massive red flag for you.", "NTA.  He didn't forget.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So not only did he not do the one thing he agreed he would do for you, but he didn't apologize and then tried to convince you that you were being irrational for being upset.  You mention he's said before that he thinks you're too overprotective of your brother.  Part of me wonders if he purposely flaked on your brother to \"prove\" that he was right.  This doesn't sound like someone you can depend on or trust to have your back.", "It\u2019s not just the fact that he agreed to it and didn\u2019t do it.\n\n>despite me texting him twice that day to remind him\n\nIt\u2019s this.

Is he going to do it anyway", "NTA. But now you know that if you promise him something you can not do is as your \"forgot\". I do it to him at least 10 times to make sure he understands how it feels.", "NTA \n\nYou bf on other side is an AH, and irresponsible and basically doesn\u2019t give a shit about promises he made to you. His opinion on if pick up needed is irrelevant- he promised.\nFor me this is huge red flag , I need a person I css as n count on, not a toddler", "Nta\n\nYou just got a glimpse into your future if you ever have kids with him.", "Nta!

If I forgot I'd be much more sorry about it. As would most people.", "NTA if he actually cared about it he'd at least apologize.", "He had one job. He promised you. \nThink about this situation when you think about the future of your relationship. \nNTA", ">What else is he going to \"forget\" in the future?\n\nYep.  The first time you were out of town, the love of your life immediately flakes on your brother to get drunk with his bros.
