I made her a really nutritious meal and instead of being appreciative she refused to eat. In fact she didn\u2019t eat for the entire 3 days I was watching her.

Let her eat junk, she's *ninety-one.*", "YTA\n\nAt her age she can eat whatever the fuck she wants. She earned it. You let her starve for three days because you think you know best.", "Of course YTA.

What is wrong with you?!??", "YTA.\n\nYou point out that you arent a doctor or nutritionist.  Did you CONTACT one of those professionals for advice?  Did you ask your family what options had been explored?  \n\nIt sounds like you have no idea what has been going on in your gran's life and naively thought you could revolutionise things.\n\nNo, you tried to force food on her that she clearly wasn't comfortable with. Suggesting new food was not an asshole move, but trying to force it on a 92 year old was an asshole move. Elderly people often need less food because their metabolism is much slower. Malnutrition is common as people often lose their appetite.  But trying to force a 91 year old to eat food they don't want is poorly advised, as is starving her by refusing to give her what you DO know that she eats.\n\nYou had no reason to dig your heels in. You should have fed her what she will eat, and then investigated what your family are doing for her diet.", "YTA. She's an adult who made a decision. You don't have to approve, but you need to respect it. Not eating for 3 days is far more dangerous for her than eating unhealthy food", "YTA. Your 91 yr old grandmother isn't trying to live a long time anymore. She is going to die soon. Let the woman eat what she feels comfortable eating.", "YTA. You starved your grandmother because YOU decided what was best for her. Your family is right.", "YTA. Let grandma enjoy her fish sticks and Sprite ffs", "YTA\n\nYou are not her legal guardian and in three short days you have disrespected her autonomy, infantilized her and let her go hungry just because of your ego.   They absolutely should kick you off the rotation.  Your grandma has no reason to tolerate that kind of disrespect and stress in her own home.", "YTA, you starved her for three days!

I can\u2019t imagine doing this to a person. It\u2019s cruel and sadistic. YTA.", "YTA I\u2019m confused how a person like this would think they were in the right? Starving an elderly woman is actually a crime", "YTA, your poor grandma.  Give her what she wants, she KNOWS it's not the greatest diet in the world, but she is happy - you'd sooner abuse her and leave her starving than see your GRANDMOTHER happy?\n\nYTA YTA YTA\n\nETA Or did you treat her so terribly deliberately so you got 'fired'? (Do a job badly, you won't be asked to do it again?)", "YTA. She's 91.  What, exactly, do you think you're doing? Do you think that giving her some veggies is going to give her some form of immortality? SHE'S NINETY ONE.  She has earned the right to eat nothing but fish sticks and reeses if that's what she wants. \n\nNot to mention the tactic you attempted to force her into eating better isn't even how you handle it.  I have kids that are picky eaters. If i had done what you did with my children, I'd have cps at my door (with good reason).  But there's no reason to change a 91 year olds eating habits, kids sure, but again - that completely the wrong way to go about it.", "YTA for digging in your heels.  Not for trying to get her to eat healthier, that was good.  But you should have presented her with a better option, asked her to please try the better food, but if she absolutely insists on fish sticks and Reese's, well... give it to her.  She's 91, unless she's suffering from some serious dementia, she's allowed to make her own choices.", "YTA- I agree it\u2019s not a healthy diet and I see you\u2019re trying to do the right thing.

This was a power play on your side - don't you realize?\n\nAre her health choices terrible? Yes. But as long as she doesn't have dementia, those are her terrible choices to make. You had power over her and tried to force your choices on her. You should raise children to eat healthy because that's your responsibility, not grown mentally capable adults.\n\nPut yourself in her shoes. 91, dependent on her family to not be put in a home. You know what feelings of powerlessness comes with that?\n\nHave some empathy with her exerting the rest of power that she has over her life. Does she make terrible choices for her health? Yep but that's her choices to make. If she chose to starve or smoke a pack a day, that would be on her, too. \n\nHer body, her choice. That also goes for choices that you find terrible.", "YTA she is 91. She knows what works for her. Do you really think you know better?", "YTA. You tried to pressure your ideas of a good meal onto your grandmother. Senior people usually have a change in taste buds (many start to dislike certain things quite strongly as it does not taste the way it used to be when they were younger) and need much less than you would as a healthy, younger, woeking person. You'd be astounded on what people can live on for longer times and I'm speaking both professionally (I'm a nurse with a fair amount on nutrition as I had patients with swallowing difficulties and changes in preferred tastes and ability of taste due to brain diseases) and personally. If she likes it, be thankful she eats it. At 91 she totally has the right to decide what she eats and what not, even if she had dementia.", "YTA \n\nAnd I hope someone reports you for elder abuse.", "YTA\n\nShe's 91. She's both old enough to make her own decisions and old enough to not give a fuck about the effects of unhealthy eating.\n\nYou are not her doctor, and you are abusing your position as caretaker for no valid reason. Let spend the time she has left eating fishsticks if that makes her happy.", "YTA. She\u2019s 91. I think she\u2019ll be fine.", "WTF? You starved a 91 yo old to prove your point? That's elderly abuse. Let that lady eat what she wants. She obviously gets enough calories. People in the last stage of their lives often have particular \"unhealthy\" food choices and unless it's something that will impact them immediately because they are diabetic or something, you let them have it, because what are you worried about? Centenarian obesity? Unhealthy habits for life?", "Yta\n\nHer choice\n\nYour disrespect.\n\nShe is 90+, she gets to spend her days as she wishes and she made her wishes clear.\n\nIs she a toddler or an adult?", "YTA here, sorry", "yeah YTA. You can have good intentions and still be TA. The thing to remember about taking care of someone is to preserve their dignity and autonomy as much as possible. You did not do that when you refused to accept her choices. \n\nShe's 91, she's quite capable of deciding what she wants to eat, whether you approve of it or not.", "YTA\n\nYour grandmother at 91 knows what she likes and what works. \n\nBTW don't shit on Reese's, they are delicious af", "YTA My grandmother ate very healthily her entire life, but towards the end she only wanted Haagen Dasz ice cream and kroketten (deep fried breaded veal ragout).

She survived the eating healthy age. What on earth is a healthy meal going to do? Make her live another six months? My gran are like a toddler her last 4 years. No kids to cook for, no husband moaning and complaining about breakfast, lunch and dinner. She survived two broken hips, a hip replacement, severe liver damage from a botched medical procedure earlier in her life, diabetes due to that same procedure and ye olde plague. And you know what? She was as happy as can be. It wasn't the food that killed her. It was the old age.", "Dear OP, my granny is 94 and she eats cake at every other meal. What shall we do? Bring her to a nutritionist? So that she can be healthy? What for?  Isn\u2019t it about time that one can eat whatever the hell they want to?\n\nYTA", "YTA. At that age, she can eat whatever she likes. I am sure she knows her time is coming and she just wants to live the rest of her days happy. \n\nYou going overboard with the change in diet is not going to help her now. Maybe 50 years ago. \n\nInstead, feed her what she wants and enjoy your time with her instead of policing her meals.", "Protein,  Carbohydrates, Fluids.\n\nShe's got the basics.\n\nIt beats an IV drip.\n\nYour fault if she stops eating.\n\nYTA", "YTA. She's almost a hundred years old, goddamn. Let her eat her fish and reeses cups.", "The more you comment the dumber you sound, so please do us all a favor and shut the fuck up!

She's 91 and still lives home alone? That's incredible! No one forced you to be part of visiting/taking care of her, you volunteered. And then you decided to make everything about you.

Let her eat what she wants.", "First off, YTA for the reasons everyone else has mentioned. \n\nI have no experience feeding 91 year old humans, but my cat will be 92 in human years in a few months, and you know what she eats? Fancy Feast, the fish sticks equivalent of wet cat food. And I don\u2019t complain or try to give her healthier food, because she eats it just fine and refuses to eat anything else, and for her age, is comparatively healthy.", "YTA. If she is competent enough that you feel she can decide not to eat, she is capable of deciding to eat fish sticks for every meal. She is an adult, not a child. She knows it isn\u2019t healthy but doesn\u2019t care. Maybe if she had advanced dementia it would make sense to push, but even then fish sticks would be better than starvation.", "YTA. So she\u2019s made it to 91 and you\u2019ve decided she can no longer have the things that make her happy?\n\nOf course you\u2019re an asshole. Also, that\u2019s pretty close to elder abuse. She eats what you decide she should eat or nothing at all? Super controlling asshole.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t want to take care of her, you should\u2019ve just said so. Not be so awful that no one will let you near her again.", "YTA, she\u2019s 91, she\u2019s going to die soon, let her have her fucking fish sticks", "As a(former) hospice and geriatric let grandma eat whatever the hell she wants as long as she's not aspirating on it.

If one day she asks for a shot of liquor, give her a shot. Side note\u2026 as we age we loose our taste receptors.

You deliberately put her in a risky position.", "YTA. I don't think you understand what happens as you get older. The digestion system doesn't work like it used to.

You are disgusting and very definitely YTA.", "YTA so, so much. \n\nLet's look from an objective nutritional standpoint what she ate:\nFish sticks - lean source of protein, easily digestible \nReese cups - source of fat, sugar, easy to chew (soft, melts in mouth)\nSprite - source of liquid calories, easy energy\n\nAre they all also highly processed? Very. Lacking in variety? Yup. Could be eating healthier options? Of course. \n\nBUT SHE IS EATING. You have no idea how much of a success that is for a 90+ year old. On top of that, changes in diet can actually be *traumatic* for the elderly. Not just mentally, but physically! The teeniest change can cause catastrophic digestive upset, and in the worst cases can lead to extreme downward trends in health metrics and even death! \n\nAlso, she is an ADULT. She may be declining with age, but you don't just rob someone of their dignity like that! You treated her like a child! Imagine after living 91 years having a PETULANT CHILD try to dictate what you can and cannot eat! The audacity!\n\n1. Apologize for stressing her out\n2.

I\u2019m not a doctor not a nutritionist but my job requires me to be physically active and I know a human can\u2019t live on processed fish and candy. I told her that we had to do something about this. She told me to let her live her life and if she passes from the food, she\u2019s ok with it. I made her a really nutritious meal and instead of being appreciative she refused to eat. In fact she didn\u2019t eat for the entire 3 days I was watching her. It was like dealing with a petulant kid\u2014I dug in my heals and so did she. \n\nMy mom was taking over this morning and the text group we use to exchange the note and schedule literally exploded and EVERYONE thinks I\u2019m an asshole because I didn\u2019t \u201cfeed\u201d her. I tried to explain that no, she made a choice to not eat. The basic point was that shes 91 and she can eat what she wants and they have no idea how hard they worked to find food she would eat at all. I said what I thought and it looked like a cascading wall of text from my 6 relatives calling me essentially an asshole.

She lost her sense of smell and taste a long time ago as is just on nutritional feed around the clock in a specialist care home to stay alive. \n\nThe point is, you went against your grandma's wishes and you effectively starved her.

She's not a child you're trying to instill healthy eating habits in. And frankly if you let a child go three days without eating, it would be abusive. \n\nA reasonable strategy would have been to include a small amount of other food you wish she would eat with her diet, not to starve her.

I went through a similar situation and after I thought about it, I was wrong.  Elderly people love junk food and at an advanced age, most of their decisions get made for them.

She was so happy about it, she tried to snatch my hand to make it move faster to her mouth. That's the last memory I got of my gran. OP's last memory would be telling her that she can't have any custard before she's eaten her Brussels sprouts.", "My grandma died of colon cancer and during her last year basically lived on weed, toast, and tomatoes.  Chemo's no fun.", "One of my great great peoples ate nothing but potatoes with butter for the last 10 years of her life. I think she had coffee in the mornings too. But that's it. People would be surprised at how much old people can make do with just whatever food their body will tolerate.", "Mine got it from bourbon, cigarettes, chocolate, and whatever tv dinner was on-sale for $1. As long as she was eating something, we were happy. \n\nShe was cheap, not poor. She always bought generic cigs and cheap bourbons, so paying a lot for a tv dinner wasn't her thing. Depression era kid.", "i found a comment of hers where she said something about a doctor or nutritionist and i commented again, and listed my qualifications. still no response. she doesn\u2019t want the opinions of qualified professionals, she looking at this point for ANYONE to say she\u2019s not wrong. and she overwhelmingly is", "So could starving for 3 days. The statistics we see about how long people can survive without food or water are based on a person starting off in good health.", ">Also, she\u2019s 91. If eating fish sticks makes her happy than who gives a shit?\n\nwhen my great-grandma was like 97, she went to the doctor for a regular check-up. he advised her to change her diet, eat more healthy, etc.\n\nshe looked at him and said \"doc, I've gotten to this age eating whatever I liked - I think I'm doing pretty good.\"\n\nhe had to concede it's a good point...", "Seriously, if grandma at 91 wanted heroin for breakfast, I'd look into it.  There is no reason at her age she shouldn't eat exactly what she wants. I work hard on being healthy in my younger years in hopes of making it to my 80's and doing whatever the F I want! Hahaha!\n\nDefinitely not a mistake and giant overstep, imo. \n\nThanks for laying this out nicely, Lamacorn.", "Yeah. My granny is like 85, and she decided last year that she wants to bake cakes and eat them as most of her meals and she also wants to have G&Ts with her other old lady friends every day at 3pm. Who are we to argue? She\u2019s had a long life \u201ceating right\u201d and taking care of herself, now she wants to eat cake and drink gin - good on her. \n\nYTA OP.", "Could not agree with everything you\u2019ve written. \n\nAlso, if I\u2019m with granny, can I have a breakfast beer? Please? Just so she\u2019s not drinking alone \ud83e\udd23", "I used to care for an elderly man who started refusing his insulin after he lost a leg to gangrene. He quit eating, too. All he wanted was beer, and we made sure he got it.", "Im pretty sure that at 91 if she dies it won\u2019t be because of food, even if it is, she still lived a pretty long time", "What is the point of eating healthy if you're 91?  You are living on borrowed time anyway and should be having the most fun you can.", "I don't know why but my first thought was \"they make vegetable fingers\". Like, if OP wants her to improve her diet, why not add vegetable fingers to the fish fingers so it's a bit of a change and not an entire overhaul?", "My 86 year old father is getting increasingly more picky with his food. Some of it causes hiccups, others flat out make him puke (lettuce, rice - yes really, rice, which is considered easy to digest). When your body tells you not to eat certain foods, then... you know... you don't?", "And probably reported. That's elderly abuse.", "That one caught me off guard as well \ud83d\ude02", "It was that particular comment that spurred me to say something, I CANNOT EVEN.", "No cakie was right. OP isn't an asshole. OP is much worse.", "My great granddad was 100% that philosophy.  He died when I was pretty young, but the memories I have are of him sitting there howling with the beagle and popping his glass eye out to mess with us.", "My grandmother is currently 92, grandfather is 90. They have some health stuff, my grandmother has diabetes. But she eats whatever the fuck she wants because what\u2019s the point otherwise? There aren\u2019t a whole lot of things in life to enjoy when you reach that age, so drinking and tasty food is one of the biggest parts of their lives. And they\u2019re adults, it\u2019s their choice.", "\u201cOP\u2019s last memory would be telling her that she can\u2019t have any custard before she\u2019s eaten her Brussels sprouts.\u201d\n\nOof. Someone give this an award \ud83d\udc4f", "lovely story. i had a similar experience. my nanas last moment with me was when i brought her a strawberry milkshake", "Oh, absolutely, starving for 3 days could have killed her. Any kind of shock to any of the body's systems at that age could be (and often are) deadly.", "YES! My grandma is in her 80's, just got out of chemotherapy and I spoil her with booze(mainly Bellinis) and key lime pie (her favorite). At her age, let her do whatever the fuck makes her happy!!", "This all reminds me of how Lewis black talked about his 100+ year old mom.  \u201cI\u2019m in overtime.  I didn\u2019t sign up for this long\u201d.", "My late grandmother did the same thing.", "Years ago, I saw an interview with the then oldest person in the world, she was 120.\n\nThe reporter asked her what she attributed her long life to. She thought for a moment, looked at him, and said \u201cWell\u2026I stopped smoking when I was 90!\u201d", "I agree but if 91 year old grandma wants heroin I'm probly gonna make some attempt at talking her out of it", "Your granny sounds awesome, I'd love to eat cake and drink gin with her :)", "Haha this was like what my granny did. When she was about 85 she decided she wanted to eat a lot of coffee & walnut cake and drink brandy, so she did!", "My auntie used to drink brandy with her old lady friends well into her 80s.", "OP is an some kind of power trip. The sheer fucking audacity of it.", "Oh, I see.

I was wondering if this old lady group was taking applications for membership.  Like I LOVE G&Ts."]}
