For background, my coworkers and I are all customer service workers. \n\nAnyways, so Taylor and I went out for dinner a few days ago to a restaurant we\u2019re regulars at. We\u2019re go so often that the staff knows our orders, which booth we prefer, and which wait staff we prefer. That being said, we get a discounts and special promotional letters from the restaurant often. \n\nWell, prior to going, Taylor brought along an expired $5 coupon. I told them that the restaurant will probably not honor it and not to get upset. They replied, \u201cOh, they\u2019ll accept it.\u201d\n\nOnce the bill came, Taylor presented the coupon and the waiter informed us that the coupon had expired a week ago. Taylor became furious and pulled a Karen and said, \u201cWe come here so often. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re being so difficult. I want to speak to a manager.\u201d\n\nOh great. So the manager came over and explained that while she couldn\u2019t accept the coupon, because we\u2019re regulars, that she\u2019d be happy to remove the drink charge, which would have been $10 off. But no, Taylor was adamant that $5 coupon to be honored and that they didn\u2019t want the drinks removed because we aren\u2019t a \u2018charity case.\u2019 At this point they were so loud that a lot of people were staring at us. \n\nAfter Taylor said that, I lost it. I said, \u201cHey okay, Taylor STOP. I\u2019ll pay for the meal at full price you\u2019re being so ridiculous it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d \n\nAnd the look Taylor gave me was a mix of hurt and betrayal. They got up and stormed out of the restaurant and I apologized to the manager and paid for the bill. The ride back home, I just told them, \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry for embarrassing you but how you acted really wasn\u2019t okay. They\u2019re just doing their jobs and you shouldn\u2019t give them a hard time because you didn\u2019t read the fine print.\u201d Taylor didn\u2019t say anything during the car ride back home and that night I decided to sleep in the spare room since they asked for some time to think. Since then, things have been back to normal and Taylor seems like their happy self again. \n\nAnyways, when I told this to my coworkers, they all looked shocked. \u201cWait you didn\u2019t have your partner\u2019s back?\u201d\n\nI told them no because frankly I\u2019m tired of this behavior and won\u2019t tolerate it anymore. My coworkers started laughing and said that even if their partners were in the wrong, in the moment they would have supported them to avoid embarrassing them in public, which is basically what I did. They said instead of being an asshole to my partner, I should have supported them at the restaurant and later l should have told them that they were in the wrong. \n\nSo AITA for not supporting my partner even though they were in the wrong?", "created_utc": 1679505704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ypvph/aita_for_not_supporting_my_partner_even_though/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This would be a dealbreaker for me like damn. I felt second hand embarrassment reading how Taylor acted.", "NTA - There's a time and a place to have your partners back and this wasn't it. They were being insufferable to people who didn't deserve it. Your partner embarrassed themselves and you don't have to support that type of behavior...", "100% NTA! \n\nIf my partner ever treated any service worker the way yours did I'd be apologizing to every single one of them, telling my partner to shut up, and then leaving without them.", "Why would you have her back when she was acting like a total jerk?  In a place where y'all are treated very well, no less?\n\n\nNTA.  Prepare to lose any discounts and perks when you go with her though.", "NTA. \n\nYour partner is being absolutely insane and unreasonable. Having their back when blatantly wrong and hostile would have made you an AH.\n\nYour partner showed and ugly side of themselves that night. Sorry OP. Wish you well!", "NTA. Having someone's back should not be for such bad behavior. Your partner was knowlingly trying to get a discount for which they were not entitled, and treated everyone with the utmost disrespect. How your coworkers could think you should have your partner's back in this case is truly puzzling. Your partner possesses a character flaw I could not live with. Good luck.", "NTA. Your colleagues are illogical. What about Taylor embarrassing you in public and harrassing the poor staff?\n\nFeels like the old \ud83d\udca9 my ex boss told me, don't correct me in front of the big boss even if i am wrong. Tell me that i am after the meeting. So many 1000s of awks when it really happened and she reported a wrong figure.", "NTA, I legitimately would not stay with someone after that if they didn't acknowledge that they were in the wrong and apologize.", "NTA. You have your partners back when you play a board game, or they're talking smack about a friend's sportsball team, not when they are verbally abusing other human beings after willfully disregarding clearly written rules (expiration date in this case).

When someone tells you who they are, it's best to believe them. \n\nWhy would you want to support someone who is being so vile? Like, ew. I don't know where your coworkers are coming from on this, but I'm glad you respected yourself and the people who work at your regular spot enough to say something.", "NTA Nope. Taylor was embarrassing YOU in public. The restaurant was very accommodating & made an offer that was BETTER than the coupon. That Taylor refused to accept their generous offer as a matter of \u201cprinciple\u201d wasn\u2019t okay, and there was no reason for you to pretend that it was.", "NTA. I could never be with someone who treated other people like this.", "NTA. Frankly, i'd break up if i saw my partner being an asshole to a waiter, or any other customer service staff; very, very specially if she KNEW she was wrong. I mean, you TOLD her the coupon was expired, it's not like she didn't realize. Just asking for the manager was too much for me, but keeping the scene up after the manager offered extra discount? That's my step over the line that was several miles over the first line; that's having an argument just for sport.\n\nAlso, you don't have to have your partner's back if you think she's wrong. You can probably do a better job than you did at explaining them why they are wrong without shouting, but she was way beyond that.", "NTA\\_ sorry if my partner acted this way I'd have left him there and walked home after paying the bill and leaving a huge tip.  \n\nWhat Taylor did was wrong, she knew the coupon was expired, she thought she could bully her way into getting more free food. Now you're not going to be able to go back there.  Support bad behavior should not be the go too response for people.", "NTA. Your partner is ridiculous and your co-workers are crazy for thinking you should enable outrageous behaviour to provide a united front. It\u2019s one thing to support a position you disagree with; it\u2019s another when they are acting unhinged and abusive. Your partner won\u2019t learn they are wrong if there are no consequences for their behaviour.", "NTA - Taylor is a nightmare.", "NTA.\nYour partner was acting really embarrassing at a place you go to regularly. Do you think the servers are going to forget when you pop in next week for your traditional visit?\n\nSeems like that ship has sailed.", "Being an AH in public means that you were an AH in public, just so your partner wouldn\u2019t be an AH alone.\n\nThat\u2019s all your friends are advocating for, to not let him be an AH alone.", "So basically... your colleagues are saying that you should have let your SO verbally abuse a service worker... because it's bad to hurt HER feelings ?!\n\nNTA. Service workers are human too. They are not puppet you can play with.", "NTA - it is important that Taylor understands you didn't find anything admirable or respectful about the way they went about trying to get the staff to meet their demands. I think it would be good to express that you understand that they didn't intend to embarrass you, and that you also didn't intend to lose your cool; maybe suggest that it would have been better to first have a conversation about what should be done if the restaurant staff didn't accept the coupon.\n\nI think in reality, you had your partner's back in your own way. By holding them accountable to your standards of integrity. From a certain point of view, enabling their tantrum by suppressing your feelings for the sake of their pride would have been the less caring thing to do, in the interest of growing a stronger relationship between the two of you.", "NTA.  I would have been incredibly embarrassed and wouldn't even want to go back there again after that stunt.  Taylor needs to read these replies.", "There\u2019s a saying:  someone who is nice to you but not nice to the waiter is not a nice person. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe deserved to be publicly shamed. That said, it's kind of a catastrophic moment in your relationship. Either it's a turning point, and he starts to see the error of his ways and how it affects you, or he feels his ego is too damaged and he resents you for it. I don't think there's much middle ground here unfortunately.", "NTA what do you see in such an entitled person like that?", "NTA! Taylor went into the meal knowing the coupon was expired, but was hellbent on using it anyway. The manager offered to comp the drinks instead, and despite that being a larger discount it still wasn\u2019t good enough. The coupon was EXPIRED. The system wasn\u2019t going to accept it. Her crazy tirade of make the system accept it wasn\u2019t going to work. Taylor was being ridiculous. Sorry, people that pull this kind of crap need the people in their life to point out how ridiculous they\u2019re being. She was embarrassing herself with her tantrum.", "NTA. For anyone saying you shouldn\u2019t embarrass her, SHE was embarrassing herself and you. A lot of people have the idea that how you treat waitstaff or service workers is an indicator as to who you really are. You say she does this a lot bc you are tired of the behavior. She really is TA and it\u2019s not going to stop. I\u2019d leave if I were you before you see how entitled she can get", "Taylor is a clown.\n\nNta", "NTA - although I agree there are better ways that it could have been handled.  After Taylor asked to speak to the manager, did you say something to her then about how she was behaving?  While I do believe it is important to support your partner, it is also important to stand up for what is right.  They were behaving incredibly badly, when they were clearly in the wrong, even after the manager offered them a better deal.  Additionally, from what you said, you warned them that they wouldn't likely take the coupon, and they sound like that was accepted as a challenge.", "NTA. Your partner was in the wrong and you tried to prevent her from getting egg on her face and she ignored you. You did a good job.", "NTA\n\nYour partner is an AH and your coworker is wrong. You did the exactly correct thing during the situation and handled it well.\n\nBtw, your indication that this is not unusual behavior from Taylor should make you rethink if this is the right relationship for you.", "NTA, but how can you date someone who you know for fact would treat you like absolute dog shit if she interacted with you at your job instead of personally? Anyone acting like that is an instant turn off. I just can\u2019t tolerate the entitlement or the audacity, but maybe that\u2019s just me.", "NTA. So you need to have your partners back during an embarrassing tantrum but your partner doesbt need to \u201chave your back\u201d enough to honor your blatant request not to have a tantrum? Fuck that. NTA", " NTA\n\nMy question is what kind of redeeming qualities does this asshat have?", "NTA\u2026what about the part where *they* embarrassed *you* in public?! They walked in, sat down, and ate a whole ass meal knowing the entire time that the coupon was expired, they were clearly planning to make a scene to get their way the entire time. That\u2019s humiliating. And all of this to save *five* dollars? Nah. You were right to call them out, one hundred percent.", "Uh, no... NTA.\n\n>Taylor was adamant that $5 coupon to be honored and that they didn\u2019t want the drinks removed because we aren\u2019t a \u2018charity case.\u2019\n\nNot a charity case but desperate to save $5 from an establishment that already takes care of you.", "NTA. Im sick & tired of people doing things because, \"thats your partner you back them up.\" \n\nWhen the circumstance calls for it, absolutely I back up my spouse. BUT. If hes in the wrong, I let him know. And vise versa, he lets me know. Backing someone up if their wrong simply because their your partner, is how you get Narcissistic Moms with complacent Dads who dont stand up for their own kids. \n\nYour partner, was in the wrong. You even tried to defuse the situation prior, by letting her know her expired coupon wouldnt het acknowledged. And yet she STILL chose. Made the choice. Wanted too; give the staff crap. \n\nHonestly thats a deal breaker for me. Think about. Its nothing more than a power play. She gets joy doing that kind of stuff to staff because she KNOWS customer service peeps are usually managed by old crotchety bosses who live by, \"the customer is always right\" mentality and know they can defend themselves.\n\nShe enjoys making staff uncomfortable. She chose to cause a problem where there didnt need to be. \n\nThat to me tells me all I need to know about a person.", "NTA you do not have the back of someone who is ill treating others. This is why there is so many problems in the world because too many standby and say nothing. I'm sorry but I'd of dumped Taylor long ago. She is toxic. Seeing the way a date treats service workers is a big reason to dump them. She thinks she is better than other people and can treat people badly. One day that could be you, or your children she treats like that.", "NTA. If someone isn\u2019t nice to service workers, they aren\u2019t a nice person period.", "NTA supporting your partner doesn't mean ignoring their bad behaviour.

Sometimes calling them out is the only way to deescalate the scene they're causing.\n\nAbout a year ago my husband and I drove across town to the cheap grocery store to buy some beers. Since I wasn't the one paying for it or was the one driving, I didn't think to bring my wallet or my ID. It wasn't until we were about half way there I realized that might have been a mistake because even though I am in my mid 20s, I have a baby face. It also didn't help that I wasn't wearing any makeup (which makes me look even younger) and I was dressed casually (hoody and vans) so I was dressed like a teen as well. So to anyone who didn't know me personally would have likely assumed I was around the age of 17. Which I find to be hilarious because Im actually older than my husband but he looks older than me. Usually in the state we are from we don't normally have issues buying alcohol as long as one of us has our ID, so we decided not to turn around and take our chances.\n\nAnyways, we get to the grocery store and try to buy a six pack at the self checkout. The checkout guy asks for our IDs and my husband showed his. The employee asks again for mine and I say I don't have it with me but I'm over the age of 21. He gives a look like \"do you think I was born yesterday?\" And denies us purchase. I didn't think it was a big deal because it's just beer and he's just doing his job and I really only had myself to blame. My husband suggests I go and wait in the car so he can purchase it, to which the employee says \"Its too late, I've already seen her. I won't sell to you.\" My husband then became royally pissed off and started yelling at the employee. Saying \"Dude! She's my wife and she's older than me! This is bullshit!\". I was getting embarrassed and had no choice but to cut him off and escort him outside since he was causing a scene. Normally I would have stood by my husband but he was acting like toddler who wasn't getting his way and I wasn't having it.\n\nIn the car I apologized for not having his back and that he had a right to be frustrated but he was still too old to be acting that way in public. He agreed he was out of line and apologized. We ended up going back to my house for my ID and returned later that day and bought the beers we wanted and that was that.", "NTA but its best not to embarrass your partner. You could have chosen not to embarrass them.", "Going against the grain, but I agree with your co-workers. If I wasn't going to have my partner's back, even if I disagree with him, I would leave him. We are one unit, made of two people. Present a united front to the world and communicate any disagreements behind closed doors. It's not enabling to support your partner. *You* choose your partner, so if you think your partner is going to embarrass you or \"you're tired\" of their behavior, then you aren't with the right person. Find someone you aren't \"tired\" of. If my partner acts in a way I disagree with, I support them, but then I discuss the situation later when we are alone. I communicate what my issues are with what happened and what I expect to happen in the future. My partner then communicates his side and either agrees to my expectation or offers another solution/compromise. Either way, the issue is discussed and handled but without having a public disagreement. This is sufficient to work out any issues with behavior in public and keeps a partner from feeling alone, when their partner is right there. I'm not going to embarrass my partner in public and I'm not going to present a fractured relationship in front of others. It's easy to support someone when you agree with everything they do. Takes no effort. You are showing your partner you love them and are there for them when you support them even when you disagree with them. YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But when your partner is shouting at another human being and you support them, or even not intercede, you're as much an asshole as them.\n\n\nAnd you are ignoring the part of my post where I said: don't be with someone who you can't support. If someone is abusive to others, then don't be with them. If you are going to make the choice to be with someone who is abusive to others, then you need to support them. You made the choice to *be that person's partner*. I, personally, would recommend *not* choosing to be with someone abusive but we have people here on Reddit everyday that are choosing to be with someone who's abusive and then complaining and bitching about it. Just because someone makes a shitty choice doesn't mean they can just be a shitty partner. \n\n>Also, why do you care so much what other people think? You should only care what you think and what your partner thinks. People have disagreements, some of which are deal breakers and some which are not. You are NOT a unit, you are two people with different mids who happen to have a relationship.\n\nFirst of all, I cannot be with anybody who does not view a relationship as being a unit. If you are my life partner, then we are a unit. I didn't say we didn't have different minds. But we are working together as a team through life. We are one unit consisting of two people. And who says I care what people think? In my comment I was clear that I didn't want *my partner* to feel like they were alone. I said present a united front to the world and I was clear it was so your partner feels supported and isn't embarrassed. Supporting your partner is about them feeling like you are there for them *as their partner*. I can make a *very good* argument that the argument to disagree in public with your partner is *because people care what others think.* Why is it necessary to disagree with your partner in public unless you care what others think? I was clear in my response that I would discuss the issue with my partner in private and express why I think they were wrong. Why is it necessary to publicly disagree with your partner and embarrass them unless you care what others think? I don't give a damn if all the other people around know I disagree with my partner. The only thing I care about is that my partner felt support from me *since I am their partner*. It seems to me that everybody disagreeing with me are the ones that care about what others think. OP said she was embarrassed by her partner's behavior-Sounds like caring what others think to me.", "Defending? Where did I say that? I said support your partner in public and have a conversation in private. If your partner does things you feel you can't support in public, then you aren't with the right person and need to break it off. Find someone you can support. Nowhere did I say defend the behavior. You don't have to defend behavior to show support.", "People don't read the whole post and just grab onto one part. Did you miss the part where I said you get to pick your partner so don't choose somebody you think is going to embarrass you? That is an important step for the rest of my statement. Pick somebody who isn't going to engage in abusive behavior. That's the first thing to do. If you think someone is going to be abusive or embarrass you, then leave them. Be with somebody you can support even when they're wrong. \n\n\n>However, I would not EVER support their behavior if they are being abusive to anyone because I'm not a shitty excuse for a human being.\n\nA great argument can be made that if you're with somebody that would be abusive to others, you're a shitty person to begin with. \n\nMy whole point is don't be a shitty partner just because you can't make a good decision about who your partner is. If you cannot support your partner even when they are wrong, then you're not with the right partner. I, personally, have not dated anyone who would engage in behavior so awful that I couldn't support them in public until we got behind closed doors. Actually, that's not true. I did once. He acted a fool in public, I *barely* held my shit together until we were in private and then I dumped his ass. Even though I knew that I was going to dump him, I still gave him the courtesy of supporting him in public because we were together at the time and I wanted to *civilly* explain to him where he fucked up. It was way more effective than if I had caused a scene right then and there. If I had caused a scene, it would have caused an argument and then I would have been the bad guy for embarrassing him and not supporting him in public. He would have learned nothing. I've seen it happen over and over again because people do not know how to communicate effectively. Instead, he was very apologetic, saw where he was wrong and reflected on his behavior for a very long time after that. \n\nPeople on this sub are too obsessed with retribution.", "wow. if you mistook any of that for aggression, really hope you have a better day going forward."]}
