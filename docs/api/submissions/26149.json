This isn't a short term favor for a friend. If the boats are damaged or even stolen from your property,  you could be liable for his losses.

Your husband is being naive. His friend would be paying for storage if he wasn't mooching off you.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your insurance got canceled if the agent gets wind of this.  Having people come onto your property as part of business activities is totally separate from normal homeowner\u2019s coverage.  The friend should know all this, and if they don\u2019t they probably are cutting other corners, too.  I would draw a hard line at storing the rental boat.

You should spend it on a huge umbrella policy for yourselves, **and** make the boat owner prove he's also insured HIS business property to an extent you and your attorney agree is necessary.

You could end up bankrupt for doing someone a favor, and I don\u2019t even understand people who think you're the asshole for wanting money. \n\nBut what money you do get should be spent on insurance. Also, you'll have to declare that income on your taxes, but can deduct insurance and a prorated amount of property tax as well. (I'm a tax nerd, it's what I do for a living, can't help myself...)", "Why is everyone assuming that hubby either 1) isnt fully aware of and fine with the situation, or 2) isnt getting some agreed upon kickback?\n\nMy bet is hubby was fully aware, wanted to help out his buddy, and has an open invitation to use a boat as long as there isn't a prior booking. And his wife is salty that theres nothing in that deal for her.", "And this is the story of how OPs husbands relationship with his bf was ruined.  Not everything needs to be transactional", "This is info that should have been added into the original post. It makes me wonder if there is more to the story. I would go back and do an edit, adding any more pertinent info to the story as there was nothing about damage or a set timeline.\nThis also seems like something you should be discussing with your husband and his friend. Firm timelines and potential damages should have been addressed before they happened or when they first started happening. \nThe friend should be covering the cost of repairs, and if won't, then talk about a monthly fee to cover that kind of thing.", "I was thinking the same.  OP needs to edit her initial post.  The more she replies the more we find out about the situation.", "The husband isn\u2019t the only one who owns the property though. She\u2019s an equal stakeholder and the boat going in and out is disruptive for her. They should be willing to hear her viewpoint and either move the boat to a different part of the property or find another solution that makes everyone happy", "Yeah regular homeowners insurance won't cover unrelated business property or claims. If OP cannot obtain a contract that **at least** guarantees the owner of the boats provides proof of commercial insurance covering all activities on her property, then they are absolutely NTA for protecting their financial interests.", "Sick burn \ud83d\udd25", "And she can\u2019t have more than one concern? How long of a title should she type? You need a bulleted list or some proof of her concern (what kind of proof?)?", "He's not.  We're not.", "So you're fine with letting a friend run a business out of your house?", "When money is involved, it is ALWAYS transactional. BF is making money off of OP & husband while trying to pull the friendship card. Real friends don't take advantage of their friends to make money, so the BF is the one ruining the friendship.", "> This is info that should have been added into the original post. It makes me wonder if there is more to the story\n\nIt seems more like grasping for straws to argue with people that disagree with her.\n\nA single picture of a \"torn up\" yard, an actual event/problem, any kind of bill resulting etc  would have yielded an instant response in her favor. At a minimum she did a shit job making her case.", "Their post and subsequent comments make it abundantly clear they want a piece of the pie\n\nIf they actually had other concerns, they would have been mentioned in the post, but they're side thoughts in comparison to wanting money", "Well then she could have put that in the post? Why mention that he brags about making so much money on rentals? All she cares about is money", "Why not instead of asking for money, ask that he agrees to trade you boat rental equal to the value of boat storage? Plus obviously the insurance that you need to make sure that you\u2019re not liable if something happens to the boat on your property", "\ud83e\udd22", "Oh so your house is also his business address? Strangers are picking up the boats from your house? He has your address on his business\u2019s cards, flyers, and advertisements?\n\nI am fine with my friend storing boats or cars on my property because I have more than enough room and have agreements that I am not responsible for theft, destruction, or other property.", "There is no money involved\n\nOP wants to involve money", "This is true.", "People request them, sometimes they come around, buy the friend tows the boat out. I still don't know what random people might show up on my property and because it's for fishing mostly they come SO early in the morning.", "See, i think that\u2019s a completely separate but totally legitimate reason for wanting to re-evaluate the boat situation.\n\nIt really seemed in other comments that you had the \u201cwell if he\u2019s making money I deserve to too\u201d when you don\u2019t just for allowing storage on your land.\n\nSure you\u2019d make the argument for rent but this being your husband\u2019s friend this is a delicate situation.\n\nLike I said, I wouldn\u2019t ask for money, BUT I agree that stranger coming onto your property for his business is inappropriate. He should be meeting them at the boat launch completely. \n\nI think if you talk to your husband again, raise the safety concerns, leave money out of it, it will just reflect poorly and more selfishly motivated on your end.", "Why is being selfish here a bad thing? I selfishly wouldn\u2019t want anyone using and putting wear on my property, actively costing me money, posing liability, so they can operate their business directly out of my back yard. Totally rational expectation for some kind of payment."]}
