A week and a half in and it was already annoying he was always touching myself stuff and drinking and playing music at late hours. My mom was out of the house for a week too so she didn\u2019t care. He would also enter my room and mess with my things. My room had two doors and I always lock the one leading into the basement. And one day I had enough he drank all of my smoothie and he thought he was sneaky and entered my room. I could see him using my towel and touching my makeup like a child who was touching their mom\u2019s makeup. So I headed out for work and locked the door. Went upstairs and heard out. 6 hours later I opened it and saw him crying on the floor. He got fired for not showing up to work for the 4th time. People are blaming me and calling me an a hole.
