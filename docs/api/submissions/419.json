Because the classroom is really small and they are many people, they sometimes are a bit loud. But that\u2019s ok and I try to give my best to accommodate them to be most comfortable. \n\nWednesday they were really loud and I announced an online quiz because we did not come to the point to do it in class. I also stated that I would upload it on Thursday and it would be due on Friday at 6pm. \nIt is not much (10 questions) just to see where everyone is at. But it is graded. \n\nI repeated myself twice that it was mandatory and graded and they did not listen apparently. \n\nI uploaded the quiz and four people actually took it. They received feedback and their grade. \nThe rest did not take the quiz. So I gave them all a 0 today. \n\nIn less then 15 Minutes the first student mailed me that I could not just fail him. A few students joined in complaining about the 0, some of them apologised for not turning it in. \nThen a mother emailed me how I could fail her precious daughter. And that if 27 people failed it would mean my quiz was to hard and I would be an AH to fail them all. \n\nUntil now I did not respond to any of this mails because then they would except to answer everybody. I will do this on Monday. \n\nBut I wonder am I am AH for failing them?\n\nMaybe for information: it\u2019s maybe 1% of their grade.\n\nEdit because I realised I need to clarify something:\n\nThey were loud the entire period. Normally this is not the case. I don\u2019t know what was different this day. This caused us to be slower than I planned and not being able to test where everybody stood on the topic. \n\nSo at the end of the lesson I told them that this quiz wad being upload and they have to take it. They were not especially loud then. But some were distracted with packing their things and stuff.\n\nEdit 2 because someone said it was important:\n- it was written on the board \n- it was written in the class book (there is all stuff written down in means of tasks and topics from their classes)\n\nUpdate: I just got another email from the same mother why I did not reply to her email since she wrote the first Ismail a few hours ago. I love parents.\n\nLAST EDIT: Because I cannot answer every single comment. \nThank you all for your judgments. While there were many helpful and respectful comments with constructive feedback, I am really shocked that people insult me as a person for an action I post here. I do not talk about the Y TA judgements, I take them. I talk about the ones telling me I am a horrid person, a bad teacher or even insinuating that I am mentally sick (via comments and via private messages). Maybe think before insulting someone for one single action, without knowing what else happens in my classes and life. \n\nNow to the quiz: They know how do to it, they did it often before, they won\u2019t fail the whole class because of it. \nAlso I am not responsible for telling their parents to remind them of a quiz. They are old enough to remind themselves. \nMany suggested that they could retake the test: they can. But not for full credit and not in class. I will tell them on Monday and it will be due Wednesday morning at 8am, also online. As it is a simple ten question multiple choice test you can do in 10 minutes on your phone that is more than enough time. \n\nAlso an Update in the mother mailing me twice: I got an email from her daughter telling me how sorry she was that her mom messaged me as she panicked as her mom saw the 0 and told her the quiz was to hard because she forgot about the quiz and therefore did not take it.\n\nEDIT: The insults continue and so does the teaching advice from some people here, again in private and in this post. To make it clear to you: I accept every single Y T A statement as everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But I do not need your advice on classroom management, my teaching skills or my personality for asking a judgement of one specific situation. The situation is this one quiz. Not my general teaching because you don\u2019t know my teaching style as you only got told this one single situation. \n\nAlso: yes I got it, this post has language errors. Surprise I am no native English speaker as I stated before \n\nUpdate: The kids came to me this morning and apologised. They all promised to take the test as soon as they get home today. A few whined when I told them they get a different test with less credit, but most accepted it without discussion.", "created_utc": 1667070992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygs5o7/aita_for_failing_27_out_of_31_students_for_not/", "score": 9404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Literal WTF.", "Teacher here. Let the zero stand or you\u2019re teaching them that refusing to work and then complaining about it is acceptable.

You could even give them the exact same thing and the kids who did it the first time get a double benefit since they already got the points and the feedback. \n\nNTA. They\u2019re in school to learn more than math. This is a teachable moment.", "NTA. It's given them a wake up call to listen for instructions and to read the board.

Alternately,  you could change it to extra credit for the four who listened.", "NTA", "NTA, but maybe explain to the students that their actions are what caused them to fail the quiz, not you.

Maybe while she\u2019s waiting she\u2019ll have time to reflect.", "I teach undergraduate classes, and one of the things I learned when I first started teaching is that sometimes you\u2019re teaching multiple concepts, and the grading distribution for the course should be proportionate to the importance of the concept. If what you really want students to learn is the mechanisms by which neurons carry messages, don\u2019t deduct 60% for poor grammar; if what you really want to teach is using plots to convey data, don\u2019t deduct 30% for public speaking. \n\nYou\u2019re teaching these kids not just the concepts, but also how to be responsible students. This is a crucial life skill. If the quiz were worth 10% of their grade for the year, yes that would be disproportionate; but if it\u2019s only 1% of their grade, I\u2019d say that\u2019s perfectly reasonable as a lesson on managing their coursework.\n\nThe one thing I would say is, it may be worth giving another opportunity to take this quiz so you still get to assess their learning of the concepts. Whether you offer it as extra credit, or to earn back 50% of their grade, or something else entirely, is up to you; but assuming you assigned the quiz for a reason, losing that much information regarding most of the class is probably counterproductive.\n\nI\u2019ll also mention: I like to design my classes with a little wiggle room, to avoid the annoyance of e-mails arguing with my grading and to acknowledge that mistakes happen. If I have 11 quizzes throughout the semester, I drop the lowest quiz grade automatically. That way, when students ask for exceptions, I can point to this policy and tell them moments like this are exactly why that policy exists, just don\u2019t make the same mistake again and it won\u2019t affect their grade. I have yet to have a student continue arguing after that. \n\nNTA", "NTA, this is a lesson in paying attention and not being disruptive.

You taught, you gave them ample time to complete the assignment, you uploaded it to a site they are supposed to frequently use.  You've learned they didn't pay attention and they suffered the consequences. This is a good moment to share with them the importance of paying attention and utilizing their resources.  The Y.T.A. astound me for how much they are enabling your students.
