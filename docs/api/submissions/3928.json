Also, sometimes a parent filing for child support can inspire the other parent to suddenly want to have a significant amount of custody and timeshare (because that reduces the child support), even if that parent otherwise does not give a s*** about the child - but just so they get to pay less. If your mom for whatever reason considered your dad as not safe with you, she might very well not have tried to collect the child support to protect you, if he did not make any attempts to file for custody and visitation of his own.\n\nAnd the last one is obviously questions about the financial situation of that other parent. It\u2019s by far not as easy as you make it sound to collect child support - with or without judgment.

It should be a non-issue at this point.", "I think so, she's has also the right to sue her father for not supporting her financially. She can easily win on the court.", "I believe an adult in India sued his parents for this very thing a few years ago. I don't think it went very far.\n\nEdit:\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47154287.amp", "Jesus, the world is in trouble with that mentality!", "I'm not from the United States but there's legal aid services, pro bono lawyers and lawyers that accept payment plans where I'm from and googling shows similar options in the United States. Also in at least some states in the US cases where the person applying for child support cannot afford a lawyer, Judges may order the parent being asked to pay child support to pay reasonable attorney fees and court costs as well. Taking time off work can be difficult, but given that the child support payment may be close to or possibly even exceed her wage given their financial situation I can't see how taking some time off work wouldn't be worth it. I'm not saying it wouldn't be difficult but there's options.", "Stop letting losers cum in you!", "Oooh I like this phrasing.", "Many states will suspend your DL over unpaid child support as well.", "My dad would just quit his job any time his wages began being garnished for child support. He always made it sound like it was an extraordinary amount and said he may as well quit since he wouldn\u2019t ever have enough money anyway if he had to pay. But don\u2019t worry about him! My brother and I had to get a job at 14 and pay rent, bills, and buy all of our own food and clothes, so my dad always had a place to live and food to eat! Lol. At least he kicked me out on my 16th birthday and I understood how to take care of myself, right? Hahah\n\nAaanyway, flash forward 20 years later and we have a court records database that can be searched. I did this a few years ago (he died in the aughts) and found out he was only required to pay TWENTY-FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH. Some people are just assholes, and there\u2019s no getting them to pay child support even with court involvement. It\u2019s truly sad."]}
