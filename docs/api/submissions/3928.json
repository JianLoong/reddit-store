It's your father who owes your mother the money she is lacking. If she didn't do what she needed to do to get the money he owes her (and still won't pursue it after someone even got the ball rolling for her) it's on her now.", "NTA. The money was for your welfare, and no matter how she felt about your father she should have had the money collected for your benefit. Clearly it would have made a difference to your early life.", "NTA - your very existence was a choice that both your parents made. If your mother regretted that choice because he was the wrong partner that\u2019s really on her but a refusal to address the financial aspects of that choice is a refusal to take responsibility for it - having a kid with somebody ties you together at a molecular level forever whether you like it or not, and in refusing to acknowledge that, she is trying to make you responsible for her choices.", "NTA. A child does not owe their parents for the parents' life choices. You didn\u2019t ask to be borne.", "I\u2019m going with NTA although it\u2019s a sad situation for your mom, she made a lot of choices that put her there. None of which are your fault.", "NTA. She should collect from the deadbeat. Has she ever told you why she wouldn't take his money?  I cannot imagine a good reason to deprive you of his financial support growing up.  But maybe she has one that you don't know about?", "This is a difficult one. Probably NTA, cause your mom made her decision for the both of you, which had a severe impact on your life. But if she really, really needs your help, you could think about giving her at least a little bit. My experience with old stubborn mothers is that you never bring them to do the right thing, if they don\u2019t want to. They prefer to go down.", "Collecting on a judgment is neither cheap or easy.  Getting the judgment is the easy part. \n\n\"All she has to do is get a lawyer\"\n\nWith what money?\nHow do you propose she pay the lawyer?\n\nIf collecting on the judgment was so easy, why haven't you done it yourself?\n\nYou either help your mother because you want to and can afford to or you don't. There is no obligation to do so morally or legally.\n\nIf you choose to help, then you decide how to. For example I pay for my mother's cell phone bill.  She was going to give it up to save money but I want her to be able to call for help if she needs to. So I've paid for her cell phone for over 10 years. I replace it when it needs to be and pay for the plan. My siblings do nothing. \n\nHelping her does not mean give her money. You could take over paying her power bill. That way you never have to worry about her power being cut off in the winter.  You're an accountant so you could sit down with her and help her plan a budget. You could cut her grass on the weekend. There are lots of ways to help an aging parent.\n\nOr you could do nothing at all. She's an adult.\n\nSo technically NTA because you have no moral or legal obligation to do anything.\nYour mother is an adult of sound mind.\n\n\nThe old child support has nothing to do with it. Thats really just smoke and mirrors.", "NTA It would be nice if you had a better relationship with your mother and wanted to assist her - not necessarily give her tons of money but maybe take her clothes shopping, take her a bag of groceries, etc - but it seems clear you feel closer to your aunt, who had a much better influence on your life and didn't make you miserable. I can understand your mom's feelings though. There may be things she's not telling you about your father, and she may carry a lot of shame, guilt, pain, and possible trauma (date rape? harassment at work? for example). However, as you said, she's leaving a lot of money on the table, and after all these years it's time to do what needs to be done, with the help of not only a lawyer but a therapist.", "As an adult, it's within your power to recognize that both your parents suck, but that your mother was doing the best that she was able to do, with the capacity that she had at the time. If that is not something that you recognize for yourself, I suggest that you talk to a therapist about your childhood and process it with them, not for her sake but your own. \n\nYes, in a perfect world, your Mom would put on her big girl pants and go after the money owed to her (and you.) \n\nShe lived through those 16 years, too, though. You might remember how hard poverty is on people. How hard it beats you down, every day, convincing you that nothing will ever change, that even if you get ahead on one bill, an unexpected expense will wipe you out the next week.\n\n*You have no obligation to help your mom.* Please help yourself out with some therapy if you haven't already, though. Even if you don't ever have a relationship with your mother, you deserve to find some kind of peace about the way you grew up. Oh. And the only asshole here is your biological father. NTA \n\n- someone who has a similar past", "NTA. \n\nYour mom was welcome to climb up on that cross and nail herself to it, but you don't need to join her.", "NTA\n\nBut I have to say your moms decision not to pursue your dad for money is not relevant at all \n\nShe\u2019s in strife and you\u2019ve chosen not to help her \n\nIt feels a little bit like you\u2019re making a show of helping your aunt but not your mom \n\nThat\u2019s your right - but I think you have unresolved issues about your upbringing \n\nIf you have a judgement- enforce it yourself", "INFO: Why are you more willing to help your aunt then help your mother? Your aunt only helped you out for two years when your mother was taking care of you for 16 years. Obviously she wasn't amazing but you don't think that deserves any help?", "NTA, you don't owe her anything, despite being family. It sounds like you resent her, and if she wants your help, she needs to help sort through your issues. \n\nNow moving on, I'd be surprised if your mum hasn't received money, being an outsider and reading what your wrote, it's very likely she did receive child support. She is angry at you now because she doesn't want you too find out, and she knows she's can't get any more child support hence why it is such a no go topic. Just my 2c. \n\nHave you tried contacting your father?", "YTA.  You have no idea what it takes to collect child support and how hard it is to enforce.  Your mother chose to raise you on her own and not spend her time with lawyers and in court for years on end and instead of respecting that,  you're blaming her for your father not paying. That's on your father not your mother.   You don't owe your mom anything but you need to grow up and have a taste of the real world to know the struggle your mom went through.", "ESH. your mum for not getting the money from your father. You for not supporting your mother that apparently tried everything else to make your early life as good as possible. Your aunt for taking the money from you and telling you basically not to support her sister. Your father for not doing what he is supposed to do. But that is too late now. If I were you, I would of course support my mum. Cutting him out of her life seems to be this one thing, this one decision she made for her own health and wellbeing.

Are you sure your conception was consensual? Is it possible that a judgement allowing for child support would have opened up custody conversations and she was trying to protect you? Some people, especially emotionally immature adults, would struggle to explain that to you or even admit it to themselves if it\u2019s something they\u2019ve tried to repress.\n\nI have a friend in this situation who has not told her daughter (only 4) the details around her birth but it was a bad enough situation that she just wanted the man out of her life and is afraid that going to the court for the payments will allow him visitation. So she just soldiers on rather than opening up the door for that kind of contact.", "NTA, that money is both your AND hers to help with, and you need to get that, if she does not, than you SHOULD go after him, as the judgement stands.   \n\n\nif you do decide to go after it, maybe put a fund together for your mom so she's able to have it.", "No lawyer needed.

He owes over $15k,  so yeah I choose to cut him out completely and raise my child with no help,  no extra money because it's a waste of time to go after money that I'll never get.
