Also, sometimes a parent filing for child support can inspire the other parent to suddenly want to have a significant amount of custody and timeshare (because that reduces the child support), even if that parent otherwise does not give a s*** about the child - but just so they get to pay less. If your mom for whatever reason considered your dad as not safe with you, she might very well not have tried to collect the child support to protect you, if he did not make any attempts to file for custody and visitation of his own.\n\nAnd the last one is obviously questions about the financial situation of that other parent. It\u2019s by far not as easy as you make it sound to collect child support - with or without judgment.

It's totally up to you what you want to do, but here's an idea:\n\nIf he would have to pay you, pursue the judgment against your dad. Get the money he owes you. For a whole 18 years of not paying, I'm assuming it's a goodly chunk of change.\n\nTake a nice vacation with your aunt with some of the money. Doesn't have to be crazy, maybe just get nicer accomodations, or do a fancier tour package or dinner some day. Depends on what you two like, and how much you get.\n\nPut whatever is left into a savings account. When your mom asks for money, it comes from there, and an equal amount goes into your vacation fund for future use. \n\nThe way I see it, this lets you stick it to the deadbeat sperm donor, annoy your abusive egg donor while still being totally generous, AND you get nicer vacations and some pay back to your aunt. The only downside I see is the stress that all such legal battles involve.", "NTA, to service her own desire for martyrdom she went out of her way to mistreat you. Child support is not about the mother, it's about the fucking kid. Her choosing to not fight for you for her own ego was wrong. \n\nYou are not the asshole for fighting for yourself and holding barriers with someone who is communicating to you that she thinks you owe her because she took care of you as a kid. But she didn't, she went out of her way to not take care of you. And also you are her child, but she's asking for is not help, she's demanding that you take care of her and that you're not allowed to \"question\" her.\n\nIt sounds like you should lower contact with her given that she is hitting you up demanding your money, telling you she will not acknowledge that she wronged you and that she believes that you have no right to even discuss it with her because you're not an equal. Those are non-starters, you cannot conduct yourself with another adult who does not treat you like another adult and is looking at you as a child who they are trying to shake money out of. It's wrong that she perceives you as a kid and is trying to shake you down", "OP=NTA\n\nyou do not owe your mother for bringing you into the world\n\nyou started paying your own way(partially) as a teen\n\nAt sixteen you took away your \"financial burden\" to her.  \n\nYou do not owe her anything now.  As you said, if she needs money, she can collect it from the man who does owe her.  Do not let her martyrdom be your problem.", "YTA for not being nice enough to help your mother for something your father didn\u2019t do.", "NTA go after the judgement yourself.  Put any money away for future kids college", "NTA. That was your money that your mom chose not to collect. That money is supposed to go to supporting you and helping you have a better life. Both of your parents failed you, your dad by not paying it on his own and your mom by not following up. You shouldn't have to pay for their choices.", "NTA", "Nta, but the statute of limitations on collecting may be past. I don\u2019t know where you live or how old you are but it\u2019s usually only 10 years you can collect on that judgement\u2026", "NTA. I kind of pity your mother for her awkward idea of \"cutting the dad from your lives\". This is of course rubbish, she simply enables this inconsiderate AH to live a happy life while avoiding consequences of his actions. Which kind of makes her an AH, too.", "THIS 100%. Mom is willing to put on the martyr act for ex and his family by \"proving\" she didn't need anything from him, BUT she certainly is fine DEMANDING her daughter give her money. NOPE - OP stay firm. Tell mom her martyr act got her into this position today, and she can easily get out of it by taking ex to court...NTA", "A lawyer may take it on a contingency basis\n\nHe may have assets like a house or land or have a job where the wages can be garnished.", "It\u2019s not that simple for a lot of people. When a secret like this is forced to the surface via the court is can end very badly. I don\u2019t collect child support for my baby because her father has threatened to harm or kill me if I do. Is it worth risking that for a tiny amount per week? No. People can do all sorts of things out of revenge, mess with your employment, threaten, false CPS reports, spread rumours, etc etc. If someone is dangerous you don\u2019t antagonise them", "Right, even if Mom sues and gets a judgement for the past child support, does not mean that she will ever see a penny. I kinda think that OP is the AH for not letting this go. Mom did the best she could and OP clearly survived with Mom  until age 16. That must have been an extremely difficult time for Mom and she likely went hungry so that OP had enough to eat. I was actually surprised at all the NTA's. Mom likely knew that trying to actually get child support was futile and maybe was not aware of the agencies in place to help with wage garnishments.", "I mean honestly this just seems like it's something the poster is throwing out to their mother because their mother went out of her way to not take care of her kids. The main issue here is that the poster had to move in with their aunt to be able to get away from their mom and have a future, and despite not taking good care of the poster the Mom feels like she is owed for doing even the parts of her job as a parent that she did.\n\nI don't think the poster is an asshole for being angry and wanting to rebuff their mother for being an asshole who spent their entire childhood saying that there was options for support out there, but that she was choosing not to take them. But it does sound like the poster should not be in contact with their mother if they are resentful and the mom has no desire to repair the relationship issues and it's just trying to shake down the poster for money", "Because why should the mother get the money in the first place? It's child support. That money is supposed to be for the kid not the parent. If the poster enforces collection the poster should take all of that money and put it toward their retirement", "Actually that is not true at least in the US. OP is not entitled to any CS. It would go to his mom or guardian at the time that had the judgement. \n\nWhile OP does not owe anything to his mom. It is also not so easy to collect on CS if the person hides money or doesn\u2019t work.", ">We don't get rid of an animal just because it hits a certain age\n\nHave you been to the pound lately?\n\nA lot of shitty people actually do this.
