It was pretty busy, as the weather was suddenly nice after weeks of rain. When it was our turn to order, I added two quarts of ice cream to the end. She asked me to check their pint and quart freezer to see if the flavors were already in there. I said I did, but one of her coworkers told her that he had just packed one of the flavors into a quart a few minutes ago and it should still be in there. I told her that I didn\u2019t want an old quart, I wanted a fresh one. She starts telling me that it\u2019s their policy to do so, since that way there\u2019s quicker turnover of the pre-packed containers. We went back and forth for a while, and eventually I just gave up. At the register, I told her that I would just go to the other store from now on, since I\u2019m not getting quarts here ( a big reason why I go). \n\nMy wife says I\u2019m an asshole, since I held up the line and was rude to the server.

What difference does it make if the quart was packed 5 minutes ago or 40 minutes ago?

But apparently you're super-special.", "YTA. They don\u2019t milk the cow and make the ice cream quart fresh for you upon ordering. Why did you need the ice cream scooped from one container to the other at a very inconvenient time when there was literally a container of exactly what you wanted ready to go?", "YTA\n\nIt was packed literally minutes before.  You knew damn well this store didn't do  on-demand quarts.  You chose to argue and show your ass at that point.\n\nJust go to the other store.

You are not more entitled than any other customer, your time is not more valuable than the other customers who had to wait while you demanded special treatment, and you were rude to the employees who were just doing their damn job. And FYI, they don't give a shit that you won't be back, they actually prefer customers like you to stay the fuck out. If you want a service provided by another company, use the other company and stop demanding low level employees go against the directives of their bosses ffs. \n\nCongratulations on being the ah of the day they laughed at and mocked for the rest of their shift.

You threw a tantrum over ice cream, they are probably hoping you keep your word and go to the other store.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m sure they cried buckets over losing the business of their most very special customer. /s", "YTA - you knew the policy, and you still expected special treatment.

It would come from the same container.", "YTA\n\nYou really stood there and argued with a server over ice cream that might've been packed longer ago than the 15 minutes that you were in the store? Wow.\n\nCustomers like you are the worst. You clearly believe that you were being 'polite' in this interaction, but I can guarantee the server doesn't agree and even your wife pointed out that you were rude. You simply decided that you were going to be difficult for no other reason than you wanted to throw your weight around and act like an entitled AH to someone on minimum wage.\n\nAlso, telling them that you won't be going back to their store isn't the devastating news you think it is. If anything, you've done the staff a favour as now they will have fewer AHs to deal with in the future.", "YTA\n\nPacked a few minutes ago isn't old. Stop making more work and unnecessary problems for employees.", "What do you think the *actual difference* would be between a quart of ice cream packed in front of you versus one that had been packed 30 minutes earlier out of the same tub?", "Yta. Also FYI the employee doesn't care if you aren't coming back. By not coming back you're making their work life less annoying since they will be dealing with one less hostile customer.", "YTA: The edit at the end sealed it. You could have said that you didn't see it and that you would check, you insisted that somehow they were screwing you over about a policy that they have no say or control over and some BS about how the ice cream packed a few minutes ago is not fresh enough.", "YTA - who the fuck do you think you are that when you are told the POLICY, that you get to just fuck it off and DEMAND that the employee risks their employment to cater to your entitled ass.

The staff would love to never see you again OP and for their sake I hope you follow through with never going back", "I\u2019ve seen servers at this place break the policy multiple times before. It doesn\u2019t seem to be very consistently enforced.", "That's what absolutely baffles me about this. It isn't fresh-baked bread or something. It's ice cream. Frozen ice cream. Moving it from one container in a freezer to another isn't making it any fresher.", "What did the store staff do to you for you to point that out to OP, they might have to deal with him again if he decides to go back", "I feel like OP was also embarrassed they didn\u2019t see the quart the first time, so insisted on being right and doubled down; op made the problem himself.

Do you notice her doing that a lot?", "I didn\u2019t see it because it was at the very back of the freezer. I asked my wife to check too before I asked the server.", "No she does not. She didn\u2019t even do that in my post, so I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re getting that from. Are you perhaps projecting a little bit? \n\nI didn\u2019t berate anyone. I politely asked.", "And that\u2019s one thing, if it wasn\u2019t there.  I mean, the employees are only human themselves.  But to insist on getting a newly packed quart is a pretty AH move, and especially finish with the ol\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll take my business elsewhere\u201d chestnut is just the icing on the AH cake.

At this point are you willing to concede that you behaved badly or are you the guy that says; everyone else is wrong and that you shouldn't have to change the way you behave?\n\nDid you create this post for validation or as feedback on how to be a better person?", "You said you went back for a while until you gave up. That fits no definition of only politely asking. YTA", "Agreed. It might be different if it had been a slow day and the employees where doing nothing else. But pulling this on a busy day? Yep, YTA.", "Hey now he's not arguing, he's just going back and forth for awhile.", "My bad. He was polite the whole time, he had this person trapped in a conversation that they are forced to congenial in."]}
