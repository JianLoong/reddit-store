{"id": 4313, "submission_id": "zgv9gf", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for taking my niece to court over a coat?", "selftext": "Here's the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za73bi/aitaa_for_taking_my_niece_to_court_over_a_coat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nSo here is a quick update, since the situation has been resolved.\n\nWhen my husband got home, I told him what happened and showed him the video.\n\nHe asked if I spoke with my BIL and I said no, all my conversations were with my sister. He said that he will take care of it.\n\nNow, a disclaimer: I understand nothing when it comes to insurance claims, and this is what my husband told me/I understood happened.\n\nMy husband talked with my BIL, told him exactly what happened and showed him the *prank* video. Then he told him that the coat was insured, we will be filing a claim and submitting the video, and we might have to file charges for the claim (he assured him that we would be dropping the charges, we do not want to send niece to jail).\n\nThen he told him that one of two things might happen: after our insurance pays us, they will come after them. If their insurance pays, their premium will skyrocket. If it doesn't, they might sue them, and might get a lien on their house. \n\nMy BIL asked if there was a way he could pay us without involving insurance, my husband told him that that was what we wanted at first, but that my sister insisted that they will not be paying us back. \n\nApparently, my BIL was not in the know, and he was very pissed off at what my niece did, and my sister's response.\n\nSo they came to this solution: my niece's car will be sold, and if it doesn't fetch the whole compensation money, she will have to get a job and pay me the whole check untill it is paid off. Also she is grounded for the rest of the school year.\n\nI am thankful for the people who encouraged me to talk with my husband.", "created_utc": 1670586694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgv9gf/update_aita_for_taking_my_niece_to_court_over_a/", "score": 12331, "replies": ["What an excellent resolution.

Glad this has been resolved and your niece is being properly punished!", "That's a fair outcome that avoids lifetime level consequences for the niece and still stings hard enough to make the point.  Communication is always a good place to start and very glad your BIL stepped up to handle the situation appropriately.", "Good outcome.\n\nBe prepared that your niece will probably hate/badmouth you for a long time, but this doesn't mean you did something wrong!\n\nHopefully, she learned her lesson before she does the same to someone/something that money can't fix. And she will at some point understand that she has no one but herself to blame.", "Your sister and niece are AH\u2019s. Your BIL is the reasonable one. Whether you can afford to replace the jacket isn\u2019t relevant. Willfully destroying someone\u2019s $20,000 property is a felony. You may want to mention that to your sister.", "I\u2019m glad your niece was punished- losing her car seems like a good one. I really hate the prank videos that young people are doing nowadays- it\u2019s like they don\u2019t understand the difference between fame and infamy. Most of them physically or emotionally hurt the victim and they are just cringey.

Your neice deserves consequences for her actions or shed never learn how bad what she did actually was.", "Wonderful, actions have consequences and it seems like that\u2019s something that the world has forgotten about and to clarify something I had reacted to calling this the age of entitlement, some and I do mean some tried to insinuate that this is something said by old people.  That is entirely false. Millennials and Gen Z have called out this behavior and of course this is one of the behaviors that would go on the list definitely.", "This is a really good resolution! It seems fair on all sides too.", "I like the compromise", "The right resolution. Your BIL is amazing and is teaching his daughter the consequences of her actions. This is what good parenting is about.\n\nThat he acted so swiftly suggests that he has probably had many conversations with his wife and daughter about daughters behaviour and they\u2019ve ignored him.", "She should lose her smartphone as well\u2014give her a \u201cphone only\u201d feature phone.", "Exactly. Having her car sold, getting a job, and being grounded seem like the appropriate punishment the sister should have concluded in the first place. Glad the BIL is level-headed and was able to come to this agreement.", "I\u2019d like to believe that BIL is a \u201cgood\u201d person, but he was essentially check-mated by the husband. The reason for the good outcome is because the luxury coat was insured and there was video confession. You can try to screw over your family but once an authoritative 3rd party is involved, there\u2019s no messing around.", "Yes exactly! I've been looking for a comment stating this.", "He had the ability to recognize the situation and place the blame where it should lie. He helped make a practical plan. A lot of people direct anger at the victim when backed into a bad place.", "What 16yo throws paint on anything, let alone someone\u2019s property? As a parent I would\u2019ve been far too shocked that I\u2019d forgotten to teach my teen the value of items and respect for other people\u2019s things. Paint on a $50 coat would\u2019ve been punishable. Your sister is a piece of work. Bravo to your BIL for finding a fitting solution.", "Maybe the niece needs to make a TikTok about the consequences of her prank.....", "I don't know much about insurance matters either, but I'm glad you've resolved this. And especially because this bit - \n\n>my niece's car will be sold, and if it doesn't fetch the whole compensation money, she will have to get a job and pay me the whole check untill it is paid off\n\n\\- actually makes niece take accountability for her behaviour. I honestly believe her life will be a lot better (for her and those around her) if she masters that skill.", "I\u2019m glad it\u2019s worked out. Your sister and niece may be pissed but your BIL and husband actually saved them even worse problems long term. Losing her car and being grounded suck now; having a criminal record would have sucked for the rest of her life (I suppose it could have ended up sealed bc she\u2019s a minor, but idk if that\u2019s always the case). \n\nThat amount for a coat may seem excessive or ridiculous to most of us \u2014 though if you read more about the brand and how they source their fiber it makes more senses why they\u2019re so expensive \u2014 but a) that\u2019s not OP\u2019s doing, she complimented her MIL and the woman bought her a coat that\u2019s the price of a car and b) if someone deliberately ruined my $200 coat I\u2019d be pissed and demand to be paid back so I could replace it; all the actual amount affects is how much has to be done to cover the cost.", "Consider drafting a contract with those conditions. If they decide to change their mind, or your niece \"can\u00b4t\" find a job, or pretends she is paid less than she is to give you less money, or whatever happens, you have a better leg if you decide to sue them. Not making an insurance claim and reporting it to the police now might hurt you in case they screw you over later on.", "**Good update!!** Glad that a logical, deserving punishment came to be. Niece will undoubtedly never forget this lesson.", "This is the best outcome. What did your sister have to say for herself after all of this?", "This is what having a partner should be like: an ally to back you up in battle. Congratulations on getting justice!", "Thats the proper resolution, but in my mind the more important issue is the niece's contrition. Is she apologetic? Is the mother apologetic? I have to think that niece and mom have exposed themselves for who they are, and I don't know how they make ammends when it was only beccause of BIL that this thing is settled.", "Home insurance agent here: if the coat was 'scheduled' and insured for its specific appraised/valued amount, you may be in the clear with a payout. If it isn't, then if the claims department does decide to payout, you'll be out your deductible and it'll be an actual cash value replacement. Meaning you will get what the coat was worth minus your deductible.\n\nEdit: I realize there was a resolution, this is more for info only. I'm relieved BIL listened.", "Maybe she'll understand just exactly how much 20K is now", "Everyone is praising the BIL...he was reasonable, but also faced with some unpleasant consequences if he wasn't. \n\nYour husband handled this very well. You married a smart man.", "Thank goodness your BIL and husband was able to talk it out and come up with a resolution.", "I was hoping for an update on this one. This seems like a fair resolution, no lifetime consequences for niece but she still pays the price. Glad things got figured out.", "You destroy property as a joke, you pay the prankster tax.", "No juvenile detention and she will hopefully learn a valuable life lesson. There are people in life who will not be so forgiving. She only loses a car and is grounded for a month or so. In some states in the US, that coat being over $10,000, it is a class 4 felony of criminal damage.

Your niece might learn the difference between \"prank\" and \"serious property damage\" after this", "Man i don't think I've seen a better example of fuck around and find out.", "I am glad this was resolved. And with an appropriate punishment,  one that shows the neice what happens when you damage your property.", "That's a great outcome! Niece will learn a valuable lesson LOL", "Smart BIL", "Sister should know better and it\u2019s reflected in niece\u2019s attitude, if it was mine I\u2019d disown her as sister.. Give this to your hubby from us \ud83d\udc51\nEdit: NTA at all", "Glad it was able to be resolved. \n\nI do wonder about the mental state of someone who would do such a shitty prank and laugh about it. She knew how much it cost and how much it ment to you and did it anyway.", "Good on your husband and BIL!\n\nI\u2019ve been hoping we\u2019d get an update. I\u2019d still say NTA if you did opt to press and keep charges. She played a stupid game, she wins a stupid prize.", "It seems like a good outcome; however, your sister\u2019s response is still problematic.  Has she apologized for her actions?\n\nAlso how has your niece been reacting since she learned of her punishment? \n\nI just feel this is a bandaid obviously and your relationship with them is very strained because of your sister.", "Good outcome. Hopefully this becomes a teaching moment for your niece and she doesn\u2019t do this again\u2026.and I hope this doesn\u2019t cause problems in the family anymore", "I'm glad your BIL reacted as a normal parent", "Hopefully that will teach the 16 year old niece grow up and stop acting like a 6 year old who faces no consequences for her actions. I feel sorry for your BIL in all of this as it was clearly hidden from him by your sister who was trying to allow her daughter bad behaviour to go unpunished", "So glad this has worked out! Kudos to you and your husband for handling it so well.", "Would it be possible to see the coat? Or a name/link of it online? Very curious what it looks like.", "I never mentioned it in the original post (I'm kicking myself because I could have said I called it lmao) but I wondered if, given your husband's family money he had the coat insured. Rich people are not stupid about things like this. I'm glad that was the case.", "Looks like Husband is the MVP here. Glad everything worked out here.", "YTA. It's a coat.", "To clarify, this is a $20,000 coat?", "Sounds like a great solution... now. But what happens when the teen doesn't get a job? What when she gets a job, but fails to pay you back?\n\nOP you'll need some legal paperwork to make this agreement stick.", "that\u2018s a great outcome, your niece fucked around and found out, now she has to deal with the consequences and take responsibility for her actions.", "I wish you would make a \u201cprank tik tok\u201d in response to your niece, showing her reaction to her car being sold. You know. Since it\u2019s a just a prank.", "It's fascinating how OP's very tame \"I'm going to sue you in civil court\" was seen as AH behavior not just by SIL but by multiple other family members, but how OP's husband's much more severe \"I'm going to have to file felony charges with the police\" was seen as a rational, reasonable response by BIL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I think BIL needs to reach out to all the family members that called OP an asshole and set the record straight.**", "I\u2019m sorry, this is not a proportional response. The coat means nothing to you, you don\u2019t even wear it, and it sounds like your spouse and in laws are on a financial footing to where this is not a real loss from a proportional standpoint. And yet you are potentially deranging the lives of your family members? If you were of normal means and they wrecked your $20k car, your response would be appropriate. But for something that is water off your feathers, do something commensurate with ruining a coat, not risking a lien on their house. Something more like a severe grounding for a few weeks or a semester. ESH", "I wish they would've just let the insurance handle it, what if they back out of their agreement?", "YTA, the fuck you need a 20k coat for? On what plane is a car worth as much as a fucking coat? Also if you take her car and sell it but it's not enough, how is she gonna get to work to pay yhe rest? Fucking eat the rich or some shit.", "Whole thing reeks of blue-blood entitlement. Dumb prank by a kid and a legal response by wealthy people. No one is the right side on this one", "This whole story is ridiculous, that teenager does needs to learn actions have consequences - but you're clearly not hanging out with people who can afford 20k coats so expecting full repayment of it is also kinda insane as 20k is life changing money for most people. You seem like you care way too much about 20k to be able to spend 20k on a coat, so you shouldn't have worn the thing in the 1st place and just sold it.", "It's just a fucking coat. Congrats your only sister, bil, and neice will hate you forever based off a material thing. The coat is expensive but is this really worth it for you to have close family members hate you?", "Good job OP and props to your husband who has your back.

Excellent story of justice all around.", "Glad the situation had a reasonable outcome. That's an appropriate punishment.", "I'm glad it worked out. Thankfully your husband had it ensured but your niece needs to pay for the damage & that's what her father intends for her to do.

I'm glad your niece has to face the consequences of her actions.", "I am glad you avoided police, OP, and I am glad too that there are consequences for the teen. I'm disappointed on your sister, though. Because she and your niece seem to be aligned in the thinking that it's OK to harm other people's things and cause them distress just for the laughs, on the internet or wherever.\n\nI'd stay away from them. Unless they went to therapy and came with a sincere apology, I wouldn't want to interact with them again. Like I said in your previous post, their entitlement coupled with the resentment are a dangerous combination. Who knows what they'll do next.", "That was an expensive prank....for your niece.", "A hard lesson. But hopefully your niece learns something. Same for your sister. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter than you or your sister can afford to replace it. The entitlement of your niece is unbelievable. I sincerely hope the consequences of this situation teach her something that will carry over into her future.", "Very fair outcome for a horrible prank.

I am SO so happy that they are actually punishing her and forcing her to be responsible. GOOD job!!!!! I'm so proud right now of OP's BIL for reigning his family in and taking care of business and just as much kudos to your husband for taking the lead to contact him. Good job all around except for OP's sister and OP's niece. They deserve it for being so irresponsible and immature.", "I think this is a super fair outcome and an important (yet tough) lesson for your niece to learn. Has she apologized at all? Is your sister still being shitty?", "I\u2019m so glad your BIL was responsible and smart - he saw the light and knew this needed to be an accountability issue and punished.

Hopefully she will never do something like this again.", "The niece should get the damaged coat. There are auction sites for luxury items where even if they are damaged you can get a significant portion of their value.

Honestly had no idea.  \n\nThis was the best possible outcome from this situation.  I hope the niece learns from this.", "Glad it worked out for you. It never ceases to amaze and infuriate me when I hear stories like this. Someone, or their kid, destroys/damages/steals something belonging to someone else, acknowledges that they did wrong, but refuses to pay for the item because it was expensive. Consequences don\u2019t just disappear because the person at fault didn\u2019t know the value of the thing they ruined, or because they\u2019re a kid! Saw several posts like this involving Pok\u00e9mon cards and other collectibles, and the person in the wrong inevitably says that there\u2019s no way a piece of paper or a toy could be worth so much money, so the victim should just suck it up. Guess fucking what: it doesn\u2019t matter what you think the price SHOULD be for the thing you stole/broke. You break it, you buy it. This post is worse, though, since the kid clearly knew what that coat was worth and did what she did anyway. She needs this lesson.", "Maybe the real $20k coat was the niece we made along the way... \n\nOr something like that, I'm not a poet. What I'm trying to say is I hope that after all this situation, you can find a satisfying resolution and that the niece learns it's not okay to be a AH.", "Thanks for the update, this seems like a very good solution!", "This is awesome.

Sounds perfect to me", "YTA-ish.\nI\u2019m conflicted because the niece absolutely deserved to be taught this lesson but having to sell her car, and having all her paychecks garnished for this seems very harsh. I know this will get downvoted but personally I would not ruin my relationship with my niece or sister over some frivolous material thing that I know can be replaced. \n\nSelling her car (assuming it covered at least 1/3 of the coat) would have been enough to teach her a lesson.

I know this is not the OP\u2019s problem but would I personally take it this far for my own family? No. \n\nIf it\u2019s insured, great. But if it wasn\u2019t, there are ways to get it fixed and she could have been sent the bill. Many luxury companies have rehab services for their products and will either fix it or replace the damaged parts. Either way, I would not risk potentially fucking up my niece\u2019s life or driving my sister into a legal limbo over something I can afford to replace. Again, will reiterate that the niece deserved to be taught a lesson but I\u2019m not sure if I would have taken this route if I am rich and can afford to replace it/fix it.\n\nIt is hard to stay objective when there's a $20k coat involved.

Why does anyone need a house when there's so many people without them. Who needs a TV when so many people can barely pay rent? I guarantee there's frivolous things you have bought that someone with less money than you thinks is a total waste because it isn't within their means. It's all about perspective. One man's exorbitance is another man's everyday life. Do I think $20k for a coat is crazy? Ya. Same with cars worth $80k. Would I own said car if it was feasible for my current financial status?

You could buy two new video games with that!\" Despite it being about 15 years since I paid 60 bucks for a game.", "I was saying that in the original post. OP didn\u2019t say what type or year of the nieces car. I thought bare minimum selling the car would knock 5,000-15,000 off the 20,000 which would leave the niece on the hook for $15,000 and below. She wouldn\u2019t be hurting for money because her parents are paying for her extras and whatever necessities she has. The amount of push back I received for that suggestion was absurd.\n\nI\u2019m just glad the coat was insured and everything wound up being handled appropriately.

My parents explained that we couldn\u2019t afford it. I asked what if I didn\u2019t get anything for Christmas or my birthday for the next couple years? They had to explain that they generally spent a total of $200 on me and my brother for Christmas, skipping holiday gifts wouldn\u2019t come close to $2k. \n\nI had a decent grasp of smaller quantities of money, but I\u2019d never had a reason to sit down and really process bigger sums. And honestly, at least in the US, I think kids are discouraged from fully thinking about that, because of the cost of college. If you know that in a couple years you\u2019ll be expected to put your signature on loans for $20-60k/year, you kinda understand that it\u2019s a lot without really understanding *how* a lot it is.

Used to give my dad most of the money and keep a little for myself. He\u2019d buy more ingredients to keep my stand going as long as I wanted to do it and then the rest of the money went to my back-to-school supplies at the end of the summer.", "I had a child-free uncle who gave each of his nieces and nephews $100 every Christmas. The only catch was that you had to visit him in person to get it.", "I think sibling dynamics probably play into this a lot.\n\nSometimes you just can't be that objective when you and your sibling are having an argument: it pulls you right back into whatever dynamic you had as a kid and it takes a *lot* of effort to overcome the however-many-years of conditioning that both formed and was formed by that dynamic.", "I've gotten a few responses pointing that out.  I guess it's difficult for me to grasp at that age not being able to understand that it's a lot.
