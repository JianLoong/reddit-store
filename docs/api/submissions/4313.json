He said that he will take care of it.\n\nNow, a disclaimer: I understand nothing when it comes to insurance claims, and this is what my husband told me/I understood happened.\n\nMy husband talked with my BIL, told him exactly what happened and showed him the *prank* video. Then he told him that the coat was insured, we will be filing a claim and submitting the video, and we might have to file charges for the claim (he assured him that we would be dropping the charges, we do not want to send niece to jail).\n\nThen he told him that one of two things might happen: after our insurance pays us, they will come after them. If their insurance pays, their premium will skyrocket. If it doesn't, they might sue them, and might get a lien on their house. \n\nMy BIL asked if there was a way he could pay us without involving insurance, my husband told him that that was what we wanted at first, but that my sister insisted that they will not be paying us back. \n\nApparently, my BIL was not in the know, and he was very pissed off at what my niece did, and my sister's response.\n\nSo they came to this solution: my niece's car will be sold, and if it doesn't fetch the whole compensation money, she will have to get a job and pay me the whole check untill it is paid off. Also she is grounded for the rest of the school year.\n\nI am thankful for the people who encouraged me to talk with my husband.", "created_utc": 1670586694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgv9gf/update_aita_for_taking_my_niece_to_court_over_a/", "score": 580, "replies": ["What an excellent resolution. Thanks for sharing it. Your brother in law is a very good man. I hope your sister realizes how lucky she is to have a man with integrity. Hopefully, your niece is getting a timely life lesson that helps her future adult self understand more about life consequences.", "Oh amazing!!! Glad this has been resolved and your niece is being properly punished!", "That's a fair outcome that avoids lifetime level consequences for the niece and still stings hard enough to make the point.  Communication is always a good place to start and very glad your BIL stepped up to handle the situation appropriately.", "Good outcome.\n\nBe prepared that your niece will probably hate/badmouth you for a long time, but this doesn't mean you did something wrong!\n\nHopefully, she learned her lesson before she does the same to someone/something that money can't fix. And she will at some point understand that she has no one but herself to blame.", "Your sister and niece are AH\u2019s. Your BIL is the reasonable one. Whether you can afford to replace the jacket isn\u2019t relevant. Willfully destroying someone\u2019s $20,000 property is a felony. You may want to mention that to your sister.", "I\u2019m glad your niece was punished- losing her car seems like a good one. I really hate the prank videos that young people are doing nowadays- it\u2019s like they don\u2019t understand the difference between fame and infamy. Most of them physically or emotionally hurt the victim and they are just cringey. Your BiL is very decent, your sister could learn from him.", "She fucked around and found out", "I'm glad it got sorted in the end and I hope she learned a valuable lesson in this", "Well, now this is what I call a partner.", "I\u2019m glad she\u2019s being held responsible!", "Great resolution and hopefully your niece has learnt that doing something to try and get social media likes can be a really bad idea.", "When you wrote what the niece did, I imagined a 6 year-old, then I was reminded that she was 16 when you wrote she had a car. Talk about the consequences of your action.", "Go husband! Excellently handled, well done.", "Thank you for posting this update!\n\nI\u2019m glad to hear your husband and BIL were mature and sensible and able to resolve this. I\u2019m glad your niece is facing appropriate consequences for her action.", "I hope they also get some counseling for that kid.", "Your husband is awesome. BIL sounds pretty good too.", "Can I be honest? I've been thinking about this post a lot since you posted it!\n\nThe AUDACITY of your niece. Ugh. I'm glad there is resolution. Thank you for the update!!", "Very fair outcome. Glad you spoke to your husband.", "Oh I am so happy this worked out for you!", "I\u2019m so glad for you. Probably saved a life of trouble ahead for niece with this lesson.", "I wish these were real", "Great husband and BIL! Glad your niece is facing consequences for her actions!", "r/BestOfRedditUpdates worthy?", "a fair resolution.  happy to hear this won't be totally ruining anyone's lives!", "Awesome update.", "Wonder what the niece is thinking right now? Probably: \"I wonder where I left my skateboard?\"", "BIG shout out to your BIL hes a phenomenal father, this is how things like this should be handled. Your neice deserves consequences for her actions or shed never learn how bad what she did actually was.", "Wonderful, actions have consequences and it seems like that\u2019s something that the world has forgotten about and to clarify something I had reacted to calling this the age of entitlement, some and I do mean some tried to insinuate that this is something said by old people.  That is entirely false. Millennials and Gen Z have called out this behavior and of course this is one of the behaviors that would go on the list definitely.", "This is a really good resolution! It seems fair on all sides too.", "I like the compromise", "The right resolution. Your BIL is amazing and is teaching his daughter the consequences of her actions. This is what good parenting is about.\n\nThat he acted so swiftly suggests that he has probably had many conversations with his wife and daughter about daughters behaviour and they\u2019ve ignored him.", "She should lose her smartphone as well\u2014give her a \u201cphone only\u201d feature phone.", "Exactly. Having her car sold, getting a job, and being grounded seem like the appropriate punishment the sister should have concluded in the first place. Glad the BIL is level-headed and was able to come to this agreement.", "I\u2019d like to believe that BIL is a \u201cgood\u201d person, but he was essentially check-mated by the husband. The reason for the good outcome is because the luxury coat was insured and there was video confession. You can try to screw over your family but once an authoritative 3rd party is involved, there\u2019s no messing around.", "Yes exactly! I've been looking for a comment stating this.", "He had the ability to recognize the situation and place the blame where it should lie. He helped make a practical plan. A lot of people direct anger at the victim when backed into a bad place."]}
