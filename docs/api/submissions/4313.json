He said that he will take care of it.\n\nNow, a disclaimer: I understand nothing when it comes to insurance claims, and this is what my husband told me/I understood happened.\n\nMy husband talked with my BIL, told him exactly what happened and showed him the *prank* video. Then he told him that the coat was insured, we will be filing a claim and submitting the video, and we might have to file charges for the claim (he assured him that we would be dropping the charges, we do not want to send niece to jail).\n\nThen he told him that one of two things might happen: after our insurance pays us, they will come after them. If their insurance pays, their premium will skyrocket. If it doesn't, they might sue them, and might get a lien on their house. \n\nMy BIL asked if there was a way he could pay us without involving insurance, my husband told him that that was what we wanted at first, but that my sister insisted that they will not be paying us back. \n\nApparently, my BIL was not in the know, and he was very pissed off at what my niece did, and my sister's response.\n\nSo they came to this solution: my niece's car will be sold, and if it doesn't fetch the whole compensation money, she will have to get a job and pay me the whole check untill it is paid off. Also she is grounded for the rest of the school year.\n\nI am thankful for the people who encouraged me to talk with my husband.", "created_utc": 1670586694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgv9gf/update_aita_for_taking_my_niece_to_court_over_a/", "score": 30554, "replies": ["What an excellent resolution.

Glad this has been resolved and your niece is being properly punished!", "That's a fair outcome that avoids lifetime level consequences for the niece and still stings hard enough to make the point.  Communication is always a good place to start and very glad your BIL stepped up to handle the situation appropriately.", "Good outcome.\n\nBe prepared that your niece will probably hate/badmouth you for a long time, but this doesn't mean you did something wrong!\n\nHopefully, she learned her lesson before she does the same to someone/something that money can't fix. And she will at some point understand that she has no one but herself to blame.", "Your sister and niece are AH\u2019s. Your BIL is the reasonable one. Whether you can afford to replace the jacket isn\u2019t relevant. Willfully destroying someone\u2019s $20,000 property is a felony. You may want to mention that to your sister.\n\n\nI\u2019m humbled by all the upvotes. Thank you.", "I\u2019m glad your niece was punished- losing her car seems like a good one. I really hate the prank videos that young people are doing nowadays- it\u2019s like they don\u2019t understand the difference between fame and infamy. Most of them physically or emotionally hurt the victim and they are just cringey.

That is entirely false. Millennials and Gen Z have called out this behavior and of course this is one of the behaviors that would go on the list definitely.", "This is a really good resolution! It seems fair on all sides too.", "I like the compromise", "The right resolution. Your BIL is amazing and is teaching his daughter the consequences of her actions. This is what good parenting is about.\n\nThat he acted so swiftly suggests that he has probably had many conversations with his wife and daughter about daughters behaviour and they\u2019ve ignored him.", "She should lose her smartphone as well\u2014give her a \u201cphone only\u201d feature phone.", "Exactly. Having her car sold, getting a job, and being grounded seem like the appropriate punishment the sister should have concluded in the first place. Glad the BIL is level-headed and was able to come to this agreement.", "I\u2019d like to believe that BIL is a \u201cgood\u201d person, but he was essentially check-mated by the husband. The reason for the good outcome is because the luxury coat was insured and there was video confession. You can try to screw over your family but once an authoritative 3rd party is involved, there\u2019s no messing around.", "Yes exactly! I've been looking for a comment stating this.", "He had the ability to recognize the situation and place the blame where it should lie. He helped make a practical plan. A lot of people direct anger at the victim when backed into a bad place.", "What 16yo throws paint on anything, let alone someone\u2019s property? As a parent I would\u2019ve been far too shocked that I\u2019d forgotten to teach my teen the value of items and respect for other people\u2019s things. Paint on a $50 coat would\u2019ve been punishable. Your sister is a piece of work. Bravo to your BIL for finding a fitting solution.", "Maybe the niece needs to make a TikTok about the consequences of her prank.....", "I don't know much about insurance matters either, but I'm glad you've resolved this. And especially because this bit - \n\n>my niece's car will be sold, and if it doesn't fetch the whole compensation money, she will have to get a job and pay me the whole check untill it is paid off\n\n\\- actually makes niece take accountability for her behaviour. I honestly believe her life will be a lot better (for her and those around her) if she masters that skill.", "I\u2019m glad it\u2019s worked out. Your sister and niece may be pissed but your BIL and husband actually saved them even worse problems long term. Losing her car and being grounded suck now; having a criminal record would have sucked for the rest of her life (I suppose it could have ended up sealed bc she\u2019s a minor, but idk if that\u2019s always the case). \n\nThat amount for a coat may seem excessive or ridiculous to most of us \u2014 though if you read more about the brand and how they source their fiber it makes more senses why they\u2019re so expensive \u2014 but a) that\u2019s not OP\u2019s doing, she complimented her MIL and the woman bought her a coat that\u2019s the price of a car and b) if someone deliberately ruined my $200 coat I\u2019d be pissed and demand to be paid back so I could replace it; all the actual amount affects is how much has to be done to cover the cost.", "Consider drafting a contract with those conditions. If they decide to change their mind, or your niece \"can\u00b4t\" find a job, or pretends she is paid less than she is to give you less money, or whatever happens, you have a better leg if you decide to sue them. Not making an insurance claim and reporting it to the police now might hurt you in case they screw you over later on.", "**Good update!!** Glad that a logical, deserving punishment came to be. Niece will undoubtedly never forget this lesson.", "This is the best outcome. What did your sister have to say for herself after all of this?", "This is what having a partner should be like: an ally to back you up in battle. Congratulations on getting justice!", "Thats the proper resolution, but in my mind the more important issue is the niece's contrition. Is she apologetic? Is the mother apologetic? I have to think that niece and mom have exposed themselves for who they are, and I don't know how they make ammends when it was only beccause of BIL that this thing is settled.", "Home insurance agent here: if the coat was 'scheduled' and insured for its specific appraised/valued amount, you may be in the clear with a payout. If it isn't, then if the claims department does decide to payout, you'll be out your deductible and it'll be an actual cash value replacement. Meaning you will get what the coat was worth minus your deductible.\n\nEdit: I realize there was a resolution, this is more for info only. I'm relieved BIL listened.", "Maybe she'll understand just exactly how much 20K is now", "Everyone is praising the BIL...he was reasonable, but also faced with some unpleasant consequences if he wasn't. \n\nYour husband handled this very well. You married a smart man.", "Thank goodness your BIL and husband was able to talk it out and come up with a resolution.", "I was hoping for an update on this one. This seems like a fair resolution, no lifetime consequences for niece but she still pays the price. Glad things got figured out.", "You destroy property as a joke, you pay the prankster tax.", "No juvenile detention and she will hopefully learn a valuable life lesson. There are people in life who will not be so forgiving. She only loses a car and is grounded for a month or so. In some states in the US, that coat being over $10,000, it is a class 4 felony of criminal damage.

Your niece might learn the difference between \"prank\" and \"serious property damage\" after this", "Man i don't think I've seen a better example of fuck around and find out.", "I am glad this was resolved. And with an appropriate punishment,  one that shows the neice what happens when you damage your property.", "That's a great outcome! Niece will learn a valuable lesson LOL", "Smart BIL", "Sister should know better and it\u2019s reflected in niece\u2019s attitude, if it was mine I\u2019d disown her as sister.. Give this to your hubby from us \ud83d\udc51\nEdit: NTA at all", "Glad it was able to be resolved. \n\nI do wonder about the mental state of someone who would do such a shitty prank and laugh about it.

I\u2019d still say NTA if you did opt to press and keep charges. She played a stupid game, she wins a stupid prize.", "It seems like a good outcome; however, your sister\u2019s response is still problematic.  Has she apologized for her actions?\n\nAlso how has your niece been reacting since she learned of her punishment? \n\nI just feel this is a bandaid obviously and your relationship with them is very strained because of your sister.", "Good outcome. Hopefully this becomes a teaching moment for your niece and she doesn\u2019t do this again\u2026.and I hope this doesn\u2019t cause problems in the family anymore", "I'm glad your BIL reacted as a normal parent", "Hopefully that will teach the 16 year old niece grow up and stop acting like a 6 year old who faces no consequences for her actions. I feel sorry for your BIL in all of this as it was clearly hidden from him by your sister who was trying to allow her daughter bad behaviour to go unpunished", "So glad this has worked out! Kudos to you and your husband for handling it so well.", "Would it be possible to see the coat? Or a name/link of it online? Very curious what it looks like.", "I never mentioned it in the original post (I'm kicking myself because I could have said I called it lmao) but I wondered if, given your husband's family money he had the coat insured. Rich people are not stupid about things like this. I'm glad that was the case.", "Looks like Husband is the MVP here. Glad everything worked out here.", "YTA. It's a coat.", "To clarify, this is a $20,000 coat?", "Sounds like a great solution... now. But what happens when the teen doesn't get a job? What when she gets a job, but fails to pay you back?\n\nOP you'll need some legal paperwork to make this agreement stick.", "that\u2018s a great outcome, your niece fucked around and found out, now she has to deal with the consequences and take responsibility for her actions.", "I wish you would make a \u201cprank tik tok\u201d in response to your niece, showing her reaction to her car being sold. You know. Since it\u2019s a just a prank.", "It's fascinating how OP's very tame \"I'm going to sue you in civil court\" was seen as AH behavior not just by SIL but by multiple other family members, but how OP's husband's much more severe \"I'm going to have to file felony charges with the police\" was seen as a rational, reasonable response by BIL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I think BIL needs to reach out to all the family members that called OP an asshole and set the record straight.**", "I\u2019m sorry, this is not a proportional response. The coat means nothing to you, you don\u2019t even wear it, and it sounds like your spouse and in laws are on a financial footing to where this is not a real loss from a proportional standpoint. And yet you are potentially deranging the lives of your family members? If you were of normal means and they wrecked your $20k car, your response would be appropriate. But for something that is water off your feathers, do something commensurate with ruining a coat, not risking a lien on their house. Something more like a severe grounding for a few weeks or a semester. ESH", "I wish they would've just let the insurance handle it, what if they back out of their agreement?", "YTA, the fuck you need a 20k coat for? On what plane is a car worth as much as a fucking coat? Also if you take her car and sell it but it's not enough, how is she gonna get to work to pay yhe rest? Fucking eat the rich or some shit.", "Whole thing reeks of blue-blood entitlement. Dumb prank by a kid and a legal response by wealthy people. No one is the right side on this one", "This whole story is ridiculous, that teenager does needs to learn actions have consequences - but you're clearly not hanging out with people who can afford 20k coats so expecting full repayment of it is also kinda insane as 20k is life changing money for most people. You seem like you care way too much about 20k to be able to spend 20k on a coat, so you shouldn't have worn the thing in the 1st place and just sold it.", "It's just a fucking coat. Congrats your only sister, bil, and neice will hate you forever based off a material thing. The coat is expensive but is this really worth it for you to have close family members hate you?", "Good job OP and props to your husband who has your back.

Excellent story of justice all around.", "Glad the situation had a reasonable outcome. That's an appropriate punishment.", "I'm glad it worked out.

I'm glad your niece has to face the consequences of her actions.", "I am glad you avoided police, OP, and I am glad too that there are consequences for the teen. I'm disappointed on your sister, though. Because she and your niece seem to be aligned in the thinking that it's OK to harm other people's things and cause them distress just for the laughs, on the internet or wherever.\n\nI'd stay away from them. Unless they went to therapy and came with a sincere apology, I wouldn't want to interact with them again. Like I said in your previous post, their entitlement coupled with the resentment are a dangerous combination.

It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter than you or your sister can afford to replace it. The entitlement of your niece is unbelievable. I sincerely hope the consequences of this situation teach her something that will carry over into her future.", "Very fair outcome for a horrible prank.

I am SO so happy that they are actually punishing her and forcing her to be responsible. GOOD job!!!!! I'm so proud right now of OP's BIL for reigning his family in and taking care of business and just as much kudos to your husband for taking the lead to contact him. Good job all around except for OP's sister and OP's niece. They deserve it for being so irresponsible and immature.", "I think this is a super fair outcome and an important (yet tough) lesson for your niece to learn. Has she apologized at all? Is your sister still being shitty?", "I\u2019m so glad your BIL was responsible and smart - he saw the light and knew this needed to be an accountability issue and punished.

Hopefully she will never do something like this again.", "The niece should get the damaged coat. There are auction sites for luxury items where even if they are damaged you can get a significant portion of their value.

Honestly had no idea.  \n\nThis was the best possible outcome from this situation.  I hope the niece learns from this.", "Glad it worked out for you. It never ceases to amaze and infuriate me when I hear stories like this. Someone, or their kid, destroys/damages/steals something belonging to someone else, acknowledges that they did wrong, but refuses to pay for the item because it was expensive. Consequences don\u2019t just disappear because the person at fault didn\u2019t know the value of the thing they ruined, or because they\u2019re a kid! Saw several posts like this involving Pok\u00e9mon cards and other collectibles, and the person in the wrong inevitably says that there\u2019s no way a piece of paper or a toy could be worth so much money, so the victim should just suck it up. Guess fucking what: it doesn\u2019t matter what you think the price SHOULD be for the thing you stole/broke. You break it, you buy it. This post is worse, though, since the kid clearly knew what that coat was worth and did what she did anyway. She needs this lesson.", "Maybe the real $20k coat was the niece we made along the way... \n\nOr something like that, I'm not a poet. What I'm trying to say is I hope that after all this situation, you can find a satisfying resolution and that the niece learns it's not okay to be a AH.", "Thanks for the update, this seems like a very good solution!", "This is awesome.

But I\u2019m possibly a little petty", "NTA and OP, while I do support this outcome, I hope you can also walk away with an important lesson about problem solving. Your sister and you were going scorched earth over this incident and it took one level-headed adult a single phone call to reach resolution.

Sounds perfect to me", "YTA-ish.\nI\u2019m conflicted because the niece absolutely deserved to be taught this lesson but having to sell her car, and having all her paychecks garnished for this seems very harsh. I know this will get downvoted but personally I would not ruin my relationship with my niece or sister over some frivolous material thing that I know can be replaced. \n\nSelling her car (assuming it covered at least 1/3 of the coat) would have been enough to teach her a lesson.

I know this is not the OP\u2019s problem but would I personally take it this far for my own family? No. \n\nIf it\u2019s insured, great. But if it wasn\u2019t, there are ways to get it fixed and she could have been sent the bill. Many luxury companies have rehab services for their products and will either fix it or replace the damaged parts. Either way, I would not risk potentially fucking up my niece\u2019s life or driving my sister into a legal limbo over something I can afford to replace. Again, will reiterate that the niece deserved to be taught a lesson but I\u2019m not sure if I would have taken this route if I am rich and can afford to replace it/fix it.\n\nIt is hard to stay objective when there's a $20k coat involved.

If she's capable of planning all of that out, she's capable of figuring out how to get to her job.", "I think that depends on whether they're trying to teach the kid take responsibility for her actions or if they're just going for punishment for the sake of punishment.\n\nLearning how to arrange my own transportation to and from work as a teenager (while I still had the safety net of living at home and having my parents as a last resort if I was stranded) taught me a lot about responsibility and resource management (lessons she clearly needs if she thought it would be funny to destroy a $20k coat for internet clout).\n\nFair point about the friends though, I was just stating my experience.

I'm just not sure having her work out her own transportation is going to make the necessary connection for her. Selling her one asset to help pay for the damage she caused and having to work to pay off the rest (and/or save for another car) is a pretty direct lesson. Also I think mom needs to suffer some repurcussions since her moral compass isn't pointing true north either. And it's worse because she's the adult.

She also left out the fact that she sent the new (now ex) roommate after me instructions on how to cause a miscarriage because she was \u201cruining her life\u201d despite her paying all of the rent, and is posting similar videos about her after she kicked her out (filed a fraudulent ex parte and sadly it worked. New ex-roommate was too broken down and pregnant to even fight it) because she stood up for herself and told her she could not continue paying for everything. \n\nI don\u2019t even post on TikTok, so she is getting pretty upset that her attempts at libel aren\u2019t working as she planned as I don\u2019t hang out with immature people who would even see that stuff. \n\nKeep an eye on your niece\u2019s TikTok because I\u2019m sure she will find a way to complain about being held accountable.", "I think that\u2019s a great resolution.

You use insurance for write-offs, personal injury (time off work, rehab etc) and house destruction.  If it can be covered out of pocket and no physical injury to you or any other person, then financially it can be best in the long-run to do so. By time you allow for excesses,loss of no claims bonus and higher premiums because the insurer recalculates the risk, the cost of claiming can be higher than the value. But still worth having if you have a crash, someone is killed or paralysed or if your home burns down. Also car insurance is a legal requirement and house insurance usually a condition of mortgage so loan covered. \n\nAlso if you use insurance, well they aren't charities. If they can someone to pay the damages they will. OP might not be covered for accidental damage but not malicious and insurance claims company would treat a lie as fraud.

Obviously the kid does not have good values if mom is ok with her wrecking a $20K coat and said just have your husband buy you another one", "This is what comes from parents not teaching their kids about basic respect, both for people and things. She did it in the first place bc she has no basic f'ng respect. She recorded herself doing it bc she has no concept of consequences. There is zero way that her destroying her aunt's coat is the first time she ever ever did anything antisocial. It is probably just the biggest thing (so far).\n\nShe, like thousands and thousands of other kids, sees all of these videos of reckless, careless behavior and how they get all the likes, and laughs, and money. But, they never see or hear about the consequences. There was a compilation video I saw recently of all the times this man and his friends got pulled over for excessive speeding in their super fancy, luxury sports cars. They just played dumb, laughed off the danger of what they were doing, laughed about paying off the ticket, and went right back out and did it again.

I even did bound- button holes in the black velvet and used vintage buttons. Maybe if your niece becomes like her father in adulthood, your vicuna will be worn by a future grand-niece.
