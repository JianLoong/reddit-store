Lightening can strike and you have a tv no more. Had one come into an electric outlet near my niece and I.

My sister didn\u2019t believe me when I told her I looked out the window, and I promise it looked like aiming at us, never mind the speed of light or whatever. So I calmly ducked and calmly pushed my niece\u2019s head down. My sister later saw where lightening went into the outlet and then believed me. Washing clothes, my daughter found out that day it was a bad day to wash clothes after I told her with the weather it wasn\u2019t safe. Landlines would get struck too and many got off the phone because of a storm. I was taught lightening likes coming through an open door and standing in one was how someone they knew departed.

And we have the term \"bird brain\" as an insult for a reason. He's not going to \"deal\" with trauma, he's a bird. He's going to flip out every time. He does not have the intelligence or brainpower to rationalize and deal with trauma and override his survival instincts- frankly, that's something HUMANS have a very difficult time doing. \n\nSecond: lights that aren't supposed to be strobe lights do not have a \"flicker rapidly\" setting. That's not a thing lamps are typically supposed to do, and I doubt your mother has a strobe light in the hallway. So, best case, it's a dumb lightbulb and a new one will make it stop. Mid case, the lamp is going bad and should be thrown out before it either dies or overheats and potentially starts a fire. Bad case, the outlet is faulty and should be replaced before it starts a fire.
