Animals aren't free thinkers like humans, they learn of dangers from their experiences and NEVER forget it. It's fight or flight. We can learn from, process and deal with our traumas.\n\nDoes your mom want to develop seizures? Who likes lights that flicker like we're in a horror movie? Ghosts anyone? Need some salt?

[Flickering lights](https://freerangeparrots.org/2020/04/07/birds-and-flickering-lights/) can be very harmful to birds, and many parrot owners go out of their way to find lighting that makes being indoors more comfortable for their birds. \n\nDoes your parrot have a vet that you trust? Maybe the vet could explain to your mother how important it is to have the right kind of lighting, and the negative effects the wrong lighting can have on birds.  Parrots are very sensitive creatures, and your mother does not know what's best for the bird if she thinks that flickering lights are no big deal.", "Your mom, I have no words. Flickering lights on purpose has to be annoying to the rest of the world unless they are out dancing under a strobe light etc. It can cause seizures in some people.

Lightening can strike and you have a tv no more. Had one come into an electric outlet near my niece and I. I had pushed her head down to lean over as I leaned down to duck and blue light went over our heads. My sister didn\u2019t believe me when I told her I looked out the window, and I promise it looked like aiming at us, never mind the speed of light or whatever. So I calmly ducked and calmly pushed my niece\u2019s head down. My sister later saw where lightening went into the outlet and then believed me. Washing clothes, my daughter found out that day it was a bad day to wash clothes after I told her with the weather it wasn\u2019t safe. Landlines would get struck too and many got off the phone because of a storm. I was taught lightening likes coming through an open door and standing in one was how someone they knew departed. Taking a bath or shower, washing dishes many still do but I try to not go there. Cooking can wait. But have been caught in the middle of cooking with lightening and had to finish. I feel sure others know of other instances that possibly can happen.", "Oh thank goodness \ud83d\ude2d"]}
