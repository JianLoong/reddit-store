It is the job of parents to support their children, not the other way around.   \nAnd your mom needed that harshness before she does any more damage to her relationship with you, her actual child who loves her, because she's so fixated on the idea of the stepchildren who've made their stance perfectly clear.   \nNTA", "NTA.

Why does she insist so much? Why does she need their approval and acceptance so badly?

Maybe she percieves this as failure on her part but there 30 years have passed and she still doesn't accept reality. She must look deeper and figure out why she behaves like this\n\nIn the meantime, her being so focused on other people's children makes her really fail as a grandmother.

Your mother has spent your whole life throwing herself at a pair of boys that I'm sure did not want to hear, \"it's ok, your mothers dead sure, but you've got a new mom\" like someone went to the dollar store, and meanwhile she has phoned in her parenting of you. Worse, it sounds like she began lumping her issues onto you, treating you less like her daughter and more like her confidant and letting you in on the parts of her interfamilial relationship you didn't want to be a part of, and your father just...allowed this to happen.\n\nYou have every right to not want to be second place, especially when the first placers have made it abundantly clear to your mother that she was barking up the wrong tree. I can't blame them, because past a certain point it was an active choice on her part to not pay you any mind, and ignore your goings on.

She doesn\u2019t care about you or your child, because she has gotten into the habit of you being there for her. She now only can think about her half-children\u2019s children.

My maternal grandmother favored my uncle's children, and my paternal grandmother favored my Daddy's ex wife, and her children, and I was the best one out of all of them! If money was loaned to me, and it was only once, I paid it right back, none of the other grandchildren ever did that. If I would even stopby to see how they were doing, but that was never acknowledged.  I was very resentful for a while, but then I just let it go, because those two grandmothers were never going to accept me for whatever reason.  The only person who loved me, and accepted me,  was my great grandmother, father, etc... Both grandmothers are gone now, and I hope that they found peace.", "There's a saying. \"Don't bite the hand that feeds you.\" I believe it applies here.\n\nShe's literally IGNORING you and your son.

I think you are right to put yourself first. I also think that it would be a good boundary to enforce that when she talks to you, that the topic of your step siblings should not be brought up. Their relationship is not your problem, they do not try to be in contact with you, you should not need to be constantly reminded, and do not need to be involved in their business. \n\nI see a lot of people blaming your mom, I don\u2019t know if that is necessarily helpful. Rejection hurts, I\u2019m someone who can also get hooked on trying to \u201cmake a relationship better\u201d and can get short sighted with it. It\u2019s sucks. It sounds like she tries with you but she needs help from a professional to deal with the rejection, and should not be using you as the sounding board, especially at the expense of your relationship. \n\nYour dad on the other hand needs a wake up call. He needs to put his foot down on this for you, your mom and your step siblings. The \u201cyou\u2019re doing nothing wrong\u201d will not help your mother who seems to be obsessed with the idea. It sounds like she\u2019s trying to do right but is stepping on all the children while doing it, and that is in fact wrong. I lost my father a while ago, my mother was not interested in a relationship afterwards, but if she was I do not think I would\u2019ve been able to call the new partner dad either. I can\u2019t image how I would feel - and the resentment that would build - if some guy were to try to make himself my new father. If he was kind and understanding that he would not be able to fill my dads shoes, I\u2019d likely let him in but otherwise, I\u2019d be putting him at arms length too. If my mom were telling the guy to keep going until I came around, I\u2019d be very upset, it\u2019d likely damage the relationship to her as well.

Maybe this has been said, I'm sure not all will agree with me but, here's my 2 cents. \nA bit of back story on me- I was sexualy, mentally and physically abused, neglected and abandoned as a child, did not have good role models.I gave birth to my only biological child 4 weeks after I turned 16 and although I made my share of mistakes I chose to keep and raise him. I became a second mom to a lot of his friends and have kept in touch with a lot of them. I also became a nanny and second mom to those children and their friends. I stepped into the role of step mom of two 10 years ago and together my husband and I adopted my sons best friend 3 years ago. While going through the process of adopting an adult I realized the great need for family's willing to adopt adults with no family so I started a group that helps connect adults with no family for what ever reason with families who want to call them family. \nThe main things I stress when people are going into adopting an adult is that you never lie to them and you must be willing to love them without conditions because most of them have some psychological issues. Unconditional love is a requirement of any parent, even when it hurts, it is not required of the child. I think your mom's a bug girl and if it hurt her feelings maybe she should contemplate why you feel the way you do.", "NTA\n\nYour mom needs some therapy.  She has this deep seated need to be loved and accepted by her step kids.  The really stupid thing is that if she gave them space when they were younger, they would probably like her now.  She's pushed and pushed and they have pushed her away.\n\nBut to make things worse, she's rejecting you and your child.  She cannot see that what she is doing is similar to what she's experienced.  It's like she's punishing you for your step siblings rejecting her.\n\nYour dad has a lot to answer for.  He hasn't helped the situation and he needed to reel his wife in a long time ago.. and probably got her some help.\n\nYour mom has some issues.  I don't think I'd be stretching it too much to call her narcissist.  She has a need to be liked and plays the victim when she's not.  It's me, me, me with no thought for you.  And your dad enables her. \n\nMy suggestion for you is to get your own therapist to unpack your life.  You probably need to form strong connections with your partners family (if they are nice) because they will be the ones there for you when your own mother can't put her own wants aside for anything.\n\nDon't expect her to change.  You can't change her (hasn't worked so far), you can only change your response to her.  I'd stop expecting anything because you are only disappointed when she fails to live up to expectations.  \n\nIf you're open to it, I'd actually ask your step siblings to give you their thoughts and feelings on your mother.  You were probably collateral damage because you are your mothers child.  But you may need to limit contact with her if this is how she's behaving.\n\nYou don't owe your mother a relationship with your child.

You should not get jealous of your moms feelings towards others. You sound like you are slowly turning into her.
