I was already tired and feeling kind of drained and to hear that she offered my half brother help when she knew the struggles my husband and I were having with our son and never offered us help. I couldn't deal with it. I told her I did not want to hear it and she needed to leave because I am tired of always hearing about how much she wants their love and acceptance when she has a child and grandchild who would love to have her around. She cried even harder and I told her I could not deal with her and made sure she left.\n\nAfterward my dad said I had been totally harsh and claimed my mom was distraught when she got home.

This might have been an AH thing to do because I know my mom is sensitive to what is going on with my half siblings and I am always there to listen to her.

Her total disregard of you and your son is weird and makes me think there is more going on. Where is your dad in all of this?", "Stop indulging her. Remove your support. She's being ridiculous. \n\nThese are her husband's children who are now adults. They don't want a relationship with her. That's that. \n\nBut she has a biological child who wants a relationship with her. She has a biological grandchild she could spend time with and love. Instead of investing in those relationships, she's moaning over something that's been going on for 30 years that's not going to change. I can't imagine chasing after people who despise me when I have people who love me and want me. That's some very strange behaviour.\n\nCut her off next time she even mentions it. She's been mentioning it for decades. Enough is enough.", "NTA\n\nShe needed to hear it!", "NTA. She is so focused on what she doesn't have that she can't see what she does have. It's not your job to be there for her. Your dad can finally step up and support her while you focus on being a mom to your child.", "INFO - where does your dad stand in regards to his children's relationship with your mother?\n\nI feel your mum may be overcompensating for something with the stepsiblings?", "Have you ever talked to your step-siblings to find out why they treat your Mom with contempt? Step-brother\u2019s comment (last person they would let babysit) was pretty harsh. Seems like Mom is reacting like most people would. Curious, why you\u2019re not outraged for your Mom. \n\nThere\u2019s so much missing here like what has Dad\u2019s role been in this situation? Seems like Mom just can\u2019t win & Dad has not shown a lot of support. Mom has the right to have feelings.\n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are ah but it appears you just made this specific situation about yourself. Perhaps you should have conversation with her about your needs & boundaries. Also, if you need help then ask for help.

Your mother obviously is one of those people who once she sets her goals on something she can't have hangs on to those goals regardless of their impossibility and regardless of the fact that something quite similar is easily available to her.

The value of your step nieces and nephews is priceless precisely because it is unattainable.\n\nTherefore your mother has some serious issues and refuses to be there for you or your child. Accept that, and ignore any criticism being leveled at you for realizing this and calling her out on it. I am so sorry you are having to deal with this.", "NTA\n\nYeah, I had a mom like this.

I feel like your Dad owns a lot of the responsibility for supporting your mom but I think if y\u2019all are going to pick sides .... someone should be on Mom\u2019s side. Maybe you should ask your Dad what he said to half-brother & why he feels it\u2019s okay to tell just you to support her."]}
