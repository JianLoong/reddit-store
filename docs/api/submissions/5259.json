For some background information, my step-daughter does not like going to school. She has multiple accounts of faking being sick and is really outrageous sometimes.\n\nLast week, the school nurse called my wife (47F) saying that my step-daughter was in the office, sick, and she needed to go pick her up.\nMy wife called me and asked me if I could go pick her up because my work is closer to the school and my wife wasn't able to leave. I got to the school and my step-daughter was holding her stomach in pain and on the verge of tears. I had seen her like this before while she was faking so I didn't think anything of it. We got in the car and she asked if we could go to the doctor. I said that she should stay home and get some rest because I didn't want to take her to the doctor if she wasn't sick. We went on with our day and at about 2 AM that morning, we woke up to her screaming in pain.\n\nMy wife and I ran into her room to see her on the bedroom floor, collapsed and holding her stomach. When we finally got her to speak up she told us she had sharp stomach pains.\nJokingly, trying to calm her down, I said something along the lines of \"Guess it's someone's time of the month.\" My step-daughter continued to sob as she yelled at me to call 911. My wife comforted my step-daughter in her arms as she told me we should bring her in. In my mind, I thought that my step-daughter was having some sort of cramps that would be resolved in the morning so I told my wife that maybe we shouldn't and we should just wait it out. Maybe she needed to go to the bathroom or maybe she had period cramps. After minutes and minutes of contemplating, my wife got up and practically carried my step-daughter to the car so she could drive her to the hospital.\n\nI stayed home with our dogs, texting my wife for updates but I was ignored. Cut to later that morning, my wife texts me and tells me step-daughter had her appendix burst and just got out of surgery. She yelled at me, telling me her daughter almost died because of my negligence and not taking her to the doctor or hospital when she asked. My wife claims I owe my step-daughter an apology but I don\u2019t see how I would when she fakes things like this happening all of the time. My wife is aware that my step-daughter tends to fake a variety of illnesses in order to not attend school. I do understand my step-daughter was hurt but if she would\u2019ve told me the severity of her pains, I would have taken her to the hospital in the first place.

That's an entirely new one for me. Crying and screaming in pain? Yeah, I used to do that too when my father disregarded my pain and I ended dealing with endless unnecessary pain and medical issues, finally losing both ovaries in emergency surgery because of massive tumors.\n\nI would have understood if she was just lying in bed trying to get out of going to school on a test day, but if your child says to call 911 then you sure as hell better be either calling 911 or taking them to the emergency.\n\nYour stepdaughter could have literally died if her mother did not get her the emergency care that she needed. I hope your wife is reconsidering this marriage, because I have a feeling there's a much bigger issue based on how you talk about your stepdaughter.\n\nThe most infuriating part of this to me is that instead of owning up to what an asshole and fool you were, trying to take care of your stepdaughter and make things right with both her and your wife, you're refusing to even apologize and sitting on Reddit hoping people will take your side and put all the blame on the teenage girl who just had life-saving surgery that you nearly prevented her from getting.\n\nNot only do I believe you genuinely don't even like your stepdaughter, I genuinely don't think you could possibly care about her wellbeing.

My father didn\u2019t understand but he took me seriously. And, like your stepdaughter, i faked illnesses to get out of school.

My dad once thought like you and it was just girl-troubles. First time he took me to the ER (mom was out of town) he got a harsh dose of reality. They explained my condition, and let him know that i could also be having a rupture of an ovarian cyst, endometriosis, PCOS, or even a growth. Or it could be my appendix. At 15, they had to give me morphine in an IV. Dad never doubted me after that. At least regarding that issue. Other things he was dismissive of, but he could be an asshole a lot of the time.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Info\n\nWhat time did you pick her up from school? What time did your wife get home?", "ESH, but mostly you. She shouldn't be faking sickness to get out of school, but as soon as she asked to go to the doctor that should have been your first sign that she wasn't faking. Trust me, nobody likes to go to the doctor. *Especially* kids. She's still partly to blame for losing your trust, but a very small part. You should have taken her more seriously. She was screaming in pain at 2 AM and you decided to joke around? That's just cruel.", "[removed]", "Surprised by all of the responses. NTA. Little boy who cried wolf is what I'm hearing.", "Okay unpopular opinion here. NTA she is known for faking things like this so it was natural for you to brush it off. If her mom was so concerned why didn't she take her in when she got home from work. Also why did her job trump your job when its her daughter. You shouldn't have made the joke in the morning about the period however your wife can't put it all on you. She needs to take some of the blame of her daughter not going to the hospital either.", "Could also be some sort of chronic illness that he thinks is fake.", "Same though. The OP cannot be real!\n\nYTA, just in case.", "Exactly. If its that time of the month and baby girl is writhing in pain, you still need to go to the fucking hospital because normal menses does not involve that level of pain. That is a cyst or a twisted ovary, something is very wrong. Not har-har funny guy stepdad, knee slapping about how hahaha funny menstrual cramps are.", "*OP's daughter is lying on the floor screaming in pain*\n\nOP: Guess that's womanhood, hahaha\n\n???", "Not really sick - died. People die from a burst appendix.", "Have a feeling because op didn\u2019t bother she probably just didn\u2019t bother her mom with it? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I know that when I was younger if pain wasn\u2019t taken seriously by one parent I couldn\u2019t count on the other either. I doubt op would bring it up either.", "I was like: jfc", "Has to be fake. Obvious YTA", "Also even if it was constipation like OP thought it could be, that can be fucking painful and still requires a doctor visit if it's that bad. Abdominal pain can be caused by so many different things; you don't mess with abdominal pain.", "A little sexism humor is the best medicine for a middle of the night life threatening emergency iirc", "You\u2019d think the school nurse would be particularly skeptical of repeat fakers, so I\u2019m guessing not.", "I agree, in this case, yes, YTA. However, this is also a good point to bring up the boy who cried wolf. But in a way, maybe this will be a wake-up call to stepdaughter.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The nurse even advised him to take her from school. A LICENSED medical professional. He then ignored that advice and basically said fuck it I don't care by not even entertaining the idea his daughter wants to go to the hospital. News flash dipshit, kids that are faking being sick don't want to go to the hospital because they'll be seen right through their faking. He then makes a misogynistic comment when his daughter is keeling over from a literal burst appendix, which can and will kill you if not treated. This wasn't a case of boy who cried wolf; this was legit child negligence on him. If I were his wife I'd cut him out of our lives and I'm sickened that anyone can even think of defending him in this situation.", "Literally nobody KEEPS screaming in agonizing pain at 2 am out of nowhere just to do a prank, smartass", "I agree. No one in their right mind would do something like this. There\u2019s also a lack of details about the mother which is super suspicious", "As well as times like when she was picked up from school and why the mom didn\u2019t take her to the hospital first. It just doesn\u2019t add up."]}
