January of last year I planned a week vacation to Paris with me, my sister, and her husband. Didn\u2019t mind that I would be third-wheeling because we\u2019re all very close friends/siblings. Although we had to cancel due to \ntheir pregnancy announcement.  \n\nObviously I was more than happy for her but still asked her why she couldn\u2019t come to Paris since she wasn\u2019t that far along. I respected her wishes to wait and that\u2019s when I decided to have to flight sometime next year (aka 2023). Finally November rolled around and they had a cute kid named Daniel.   \n\nNow it\u2019s March and I said to my sister \u201cSo you excited for the trip?\u201d With a huge grin she said that she\u2019s delighted to bring Daniel with her. I made a face which she saw right away, \u201cYou\u2019re bringing him with you?\u201d. This lead to a very heated agruement where she couldn\u2019t just leave the baby and I told her maybe Max (her husband) stayed and we went together.  \n\nBOOM she yelled how inconsiderate I was being. \u201cThen you three stay and I\u2019ll go by myself.\u201d I suggested that an even more agruing started. she stormed out and called me an asshole for saying such \u2018flabbergasting things\u201d.

Do you really think a mother is going to leave her newborn? Of course she is gonna bring the kid. If you want a party vacation maybe go by yourself.", "NAH I get why you want the trip and time with your sister and she could be more understanding of that. Most new parents don\u2019t want to leave a new baby home, though. Maybe you should go on your own or with a friend on this trip and plan a shorter weekend visit in your sister\u2019s town to have time together", "NAH. Go on your own.", "Info: who\u2019s paying for the trip I think matters here. If you\u2019re all paying for fair share, it\u2019s fair game. But if 1 person is paying for the whole thing, yeah they do get to set some expectations/boundaries for the trip. \n\nSounds like there was a mismatch in expectations for this new trip, you wanted to proceed as originally intended and the parents now have a baby to consider. Could simply be you just missed the opportunity to do Paris with your sister kid free, that\u2019s life.", "NAH.  I mean duh of course you don't want to go to Paris with a baby, that is a BUZZKILL.  But yeah, she also doesn't want to leave her infant behind.  Y'all should've gone while she was pregnant, or y'all need to hold off until she's comfortable leaving her kid behind.  Or you need to find someone else to go with.", ">I just thought a BABY would make this not a vacation and more of a \u2018you   \ngo see the eiffel tower and i\u2019ll stay at the hotel all day with the   \nbaby.\n\nWhy should she have to stay in the hotel? Having a baby doesn't mean you cant strap them into a snugglie and go do all the things you wanted to start with. Western Europe is very acceptant of breastfeeding, you can whip a tit out almost anywhere. And toilets for changing diapers are available pretty much everywhere. Also, there are a metric ton of children running around the Eiffel tower. The viewing decks are even stroller friendly, with the exception of the top which you cant always bank on seeing anyways due to weather.   \n\n\nAll of you are too old to be out enjoying the clubbing scene(legal age in France is 18, clubs are packed with teens/early 20's and you will stand out as both older and foreign) so having a baby tag along wouldnt really change anything you'd most likely be doing anyways.", "Soft ESH. You can't count on her to be a part of the fun vacation you imagined pre-pregnancy  now that she has a baby to care for. She can't just leave a tiny baby at home, even with her husband. At the same time, she can't expect to bring a baby and have it be as fun for everyone as imagined before the baby was born. You would be better off going alone or with a friend. I love Paris and have no infants let's go \ud83d\ude06", "NAH. \n\nA new first-time parent is not going to leave their newborn behind. It just isn't going to happen. It's a bit tone-deaf that you didn't realize that. But I get that having a baby along would make it a completely different vacation for you (as it would me) and that that's not what you want to do. So I think it's totally fair for you to want to travel by yourself. \n\nI suspect this conflict came more from miscommunications and assumptions than the actual stances that people are actually taking.", "Honestly a little of ESH. Who tf brings a newborn on an international trip without a very good reason? Also you can\u2019t control whether she brings the baby, but you can control whether you go with them at all.", "NTA - you already cancelled the trip once for the pregnancy and traveling with a baby def changes the whole trip vibe. They should have at least asked you how you felt before just springing it on you. It's a whole different trip with a baby.", "YTA\n\nFirst you questioned her for not wanting to go on the vacation while pregnant.\n\nThen you assumed she would just leave her infant child behind to go on an international trip with you?  Seriously?\n\nStop pushing *your* vacation assumptions onto other people.  If you want a specific kind of trip, go by yourself.  Don\u2019t plan a trip and expect everyone else to fall in line with what you want - especially when what you want is for them to leave their kid behind!", "NTA. Just go.", "YTA and very wrong. This is one of the best times to travel with baby as he can\u2019t move, his food is easy to provide, he doesn\u2019t complain, he flies for free and him sleeping doesn\u2019t impede taking him places. I would reconsider the trip. My sister and I enjoyed bringing my son to all the festivals and restaurants in my tourist home town when he was tiny. Unless you want to do drugs or drink tons, a six month old doesn\u2019t change too much. Unless you don\u2019t like baby, or course.", "NTA but you need to get your own life.", "YA ain\u2019t nobody leaving their 4 month old to go on  trip.", "I think this is a NAH / ESH situation.\n\nIt seems like everyone got pissed off and no one actually communicated a damn thing. I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole for not assuming Daniel would be going with, probably naive. \n\nYou need to have an actual conversation with your sister and her husband about this trip. What everyone\u2019s expectations are, if the trip is going to happen, etc. You also need to apologize for not realizing that Daniel would also be going on the trip, whether you intended to or not, you obviously upset your sister and caused an argument.", "NAH.  I mean, it was kind of silly to think she\u2019d be ready to leave her baby.  However, obviously people won\u2019t want a baby on vacation unless it\u2019s already kid-oriented.  Both things just seem like common sense to me.  It would change the whole feel of the trip.  It\u2019d be way better to reschedule again or just not go together.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a parent so why would assume a baby would be fun. She\u2019s being silly if she thinks you want to travel with a baby.", "It would be best for them to go with the baby.  That way they can see the reality of becoming parents.", "I think you're really foolish or just hella naive thinking this trip wasn't going to completely change after their pregnancy. Maybe slightly YTA for\n\n>I made a face which she saw right away, \u201cYou\u2019re bringing him with you?\u201d\n\nBut honestly you all need to adjust your expectations for just about everything going forward.", "YTA and an idiot. What did you expect? Ofc she\u2019d bring the baby. You\u2019re an idiot for not realising that and an AH for getting all prissy about it.", "YTA, she cannot leave a new born baby. Go by tourself.", "YTA. You expect a mom who just had her baby 3 months go to leave it behind while she goes on a week long trip? That's insane.", "YTA\n\nDude - you should have talked to her *while she was pregnant* about your travel plans. Checked in with her again after the baby was born. You should not have assumed. This is on you.", "This is a joke right??", "YTA - You seriously think a new mother is going to leave the baby?  I can see not doing the trip as the baby will clearly change it, but expecting her and her husband to leave it behind makes you TA.", "YTA\n\nBut I get it, having a little kid on a vacation is not my idea of an enjoyable vacation either. The thing you need to understand is that your sister is in mom mode with mom brain and for a long time her the kid will be a package deal.\nIf you want private adult sibling time with her, that's probably not gonna happen for a while.", "Yup. Ya are OP. You don\u2019t seem to have any sense of how the blessed event may have changed the life and priorities of your sister. It\u2019s amazing she\u2019s going at all! But of course she\u2019s going to bring her tiny baby. The baby is very likely still nursing. It\u2019s not so simple, practically or emotionally, to ditch your brand new baby. It could be worked out, but she doesn\u2019t want to. Most people wouldn\u2019t. And you\u2019re not sensitive to that fact. Or much of anything as far as I can tell. YTA", "YTA for not realizing that the nature of the vacation would dramatically change. If you wanted an adult vacation you should have just gone yourself (or invited others along). It's not like your sister is going to drop her baby off at a kennel for the week!", "YTA but you won't understand this unless you have a baby one day yourself. It's just not possible to leave a newborn whether it's with her husband or a nanny or grandma. Even if she wanted to, no one understands how biologically difficult that is. Either cancel the trip and go with someone else or go as a family. She won't be fun if she's thinking of how she left her baby behind the whole time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would have assumed that the baby was staying at home with grands or the husband.  The sister should recognize that it should be approved by others in the travel party.  \nThe reaction sounds like where OP lost the high ground.

They are basically like hand luggage and sleep most of the time. Most of the difficulties with travel and babies is actually due to parents who put up weird ideas of needing specific schedules for a baby rather than the actual baby who can generally just be carried anywhere/everywhere without much fuss so long as you have the means to change and feed them.", "Me.

He slept and ate.", "I don\u2019t think the baby should be left home alone", "She also just assumed the kid would be okay to bring as if that wouldn't change anything about the trip but she can't be held responsible right? Only op? Also do you think at any point during the trip the parents would ask him to watch the kid while they do something no matter the length of time? Does this also bleed into the fun as in does he have to restrain his drinking and other fun vacation activities because there is a child? Not just because of influence but because there needs to be sober people to help with the baby and on top of that what activities did op have planned that he can't do now because of the baby? At worst all assholes or none are but all parties messed up communication and planning", "How can you be so fkn stupid", "I think maybe your delivery is part of the problem here.
