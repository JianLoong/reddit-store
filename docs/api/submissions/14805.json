Most new parents don\u2019t want to leave a new baby home, though.

But if 1 person is paying for the whole thing, yeah they do get to set some expectations/boundaries for the trip. \n\nSounds like there was a mismatch in expectations for this new trip, you wanted to proceed as originally intended and the parents now have a baby to consider. Could simply be you just missed the opportunity to do Paris with your sister kid free, that\u2019s life.", "NAH.  I mean duh of course you don't want to go to Paris with a baby, that is a BUZZKILL.

Having a baby doesn't mean you cant strap them into a snugglie and go do all the things you wanted to start with. Western Europe is very acceptant of breastfeeding, you can whip a tit out almost anywhere. And toilets for changing diapers are available pretty much everywhere. Also, there are a metric ton of children running around the Eiffel tower. The viewing decks are even stroller friendly, with the exception of the top which you cant always bank on seeing anyways due to weather.   \n\n\nAll of you are too old to be out enjoying the clubbing scene(legal age in France is 18, clubs are packed with teens/early 20's and you will stand out as both older and foreign) so having a baby tag along wouldnt really change anything you'd most likely be doing anyways.", "Soft ESH. You can't count on her to be a part of the fun vacation you imagined pre-pregnancy  now that she has a baby to care for. She can't just leave a tiny baby at home, even with her husband.

This is one of the best times to travel with baby as he can\u2019t move, his food is easy to provide, he doesn\u2019t complain, he flies for free and him sleeping doesn\u2019t impede taking him places. I would reconsider the trip. My sister and I enjoyed bringing my son to all the festivals and restaurants in my tourist home town when he was tiny.

What everyone\u2019s expectations are, if the trip is going to happen, etc. You also need to apologize for not realizing that Daniel would also be going on the trip, whether you intended to or not, you obviously upset your sister and caused an argument.", "NAH.  I mean, it was kind of silly to think she\u2019d be ready to leave her baby.  However, obviously people won\u2019t want a baby on vacation unless it\u2019s already kid-oriented.  Both things just seem like common sense to me.  It would change the whole feel of the trip.  It\u2019d be way better to reschedule again or just not go together.", "NTA.

That's insane.", "YTA\n\nDude - you should have talked to her *while she was pregnant* about your travel plans. Checked in with her again after the baby was born. You should not have assumed. This is on you.", "This is a joke right??", "YTA - You seriously think a new mother is going to leave the baby?  I can see not doing the trip as the baby will clearly change it, but expecting her and her husband to leave it behind makes you TA.", "YTA\n\nBut I get it, having a little kid on a vacation is not my idea of an enjoyable vacation either. The thing you need to understand is that your sister is in mom mode with mom brain and for a long time her the kid will be a package deal.\nIf you want private adult sibling time with her, that's probably not gonna happen for a while.", "Yup. Ya are OP. You don\u2019t seem to have any sense of how the blessed event may have changed the life and priorities of your sister. It\u2019s amazing she\u2019s going at all!

It's just not possible to leave a newborn whether it's with her husband or a nanny or grandma. Even if she wanted to, no one understands how biologically difficult that is.

You\u2019ll have to get the baby a seat on the plane, then they\u2019re also going to have the baby on a plane for however long, then the absolute nightmare of having to transport the baby around the city. \n\nA lot of buildings in Europe are old and cramped, which means it\u2019ll be very difficult trying to care of the baby in the first place. A lot of the buildings/restaurants require you to go up and down the stairs for the bathroom, or if the first floor of the restaurant doesn\u2019t have any seating they\u2019ll try and sit you on the second floor. I\u2019ve had the joy of watching many a couple try and tough it out then give up because it was difficult. Trying to haul baby and everything for the baby up and down the stairs, multiple times a day, is very exhausting and time consuming and because a lot of these spaces are cramped, good luck finding somewhere to put the stroller. I saw many parents who were clearly on vacation with their babies just absolutely miserable. They are pretty good about having elevators in the public transit, but for the clueless parents it was also interesting seeing them try to get on the escalator with the stroller. \n\nYour sister needs to accept that the baby is somewhat limiting in what she can and can\u2019t do, and she\u2019ll have to wait until he\u2019s older to go. For you, absolutely you should go and make it a solo trip! Solo trips are the best because you\u2019re responsible for no one but yourself so you can do whatever you want. If she gets upset, too bad so sad, maybe she should\u2019ve thought about some of the things she wanted to do before having the baby. I\u2019m going to guess she didn\u2019t want to go while pregnant because of the limitations on food and alcohol, so wanted to wait until she could enjoy it. But then I also suspect that means she\u2019s be expecting you to also help with the baby. What\u2019s the point of going on a trip when all their attention and energy are going towards the baby? I\u2019m not saying all that to be harsh, just seen way too many parents on all of my international trips naively think they can just go on and live their merry lives plus baby when that\u2019s not how it works at all.

Please genuinely, explain it. Again, I'm not disagreeing, I genuinely don't understand. Of course I'm assuming there was nothing high risk since I didn't see it mentioned. \n\nAs for asking if they could leave the baby, again, I don't understand. I completely understand that new parents might not want to, but I don't get how it's offensive wonder why they won't leave a \u22486 month-old with grandparents or something. OP organized this trip and already catered to them by postponing it for so long. I think (due to their needs, etc) there is a reasonable expectation that an infant isn't a good international travel and sightseeing companion and therefore wouldn't be attending.\n\nCould OP have worded things better?

It would give you a chance to see first hand what your sister\u2019s life is like now, and maybe even create your own special bond with your nephew.    \n\nIf you love your sister and want her in your life, you have to come to terms with her child. I would suggest going.", "Eh soft YTA. I think you should\u2019ve assumed when she announced she was pregnant that the trip was either off or she\u2019s going to bring her baby. Especially if she\u2019s breastfeeding, she can\u2019t be away from her baby for a week. Having a baby isn\u2019t a death sentence. Of course it would be a different experience, but traveling with a baby isn\u2019t impossible. Being so little they mostly just sit in the stroller when out anyway", "Yta", "Women can travel when pregnant far  more easily that  a mother with a baby.\n\nWhy would you expect a mother, a couple with a new born to take vacation without their infant  is beyond me.\n\nYTA", "YTA  No good mother is going to leave her newborn baby to go to another country for a party vacation. You shouldve just gone when she was pregnant if she was comfortable going.", "YTA", "NTA.  BUT your execution is all wrong! You can travel with the baby, but maybe it would be a good idea to bring like one more person with for you to kick it with when they can\u2019t do certain things , like night life .. etc \ud83d\ude0f", "Question: are you paying for everything and everyone?", "YTA. You need to plan a vacation without your sister.  It\u2019s not likely that she will be ready for a party trip anytime soon", "Esh- both sides assumed something different. Didn\u2019t neither of you think to talk about this trip at all? Just go by yourself", "YTA for expecting a new mother to leave her newborn home. NTA for planning to go alone instead. Until you become a mother, you won\u2019t understand why a mother can\u2019t part with her newborn/ how hard it is when they have to.", "Hmmm ESH. Its kind of obvious that she will want to bring her baby with her since its a newborn. \nAnd your sister...I don't know why she reacted like that...but I do think she will react negatively even if you had travelled alone unannounced. Or maybe, you did not have a proper way to tell her that you are going to travel alone, which could explained the outburst. \nYou obviously do lack in the social skills department.", "NAH, totally understandable that she doesn't want to leave her kid or husband behind. However, having a baby along would change the whole trip, and it would definitely be more of them taking care of their child than actually being able to do anything fun on the trip. It could also make the third-wheeling an actual issue as they will presumably need to spend more time alone with their child.\n\nI'd say go with another friend and try to schedule something smaller with them later.", "NTA. I don\u2019t like kids.", "EsH I think. Go alone.", "NTA, but you could have predicted this.", "NTA kids ruin everything", "If you really had your heart set on you and your sister and BIL doing this together,there\u2019s the option of putting it off for at least five years,but I doubt anybody wants to wait that long. I really think you have the wrong idea about how hard it is dealing with a newborn in this situation. Unless you wanted everybody to get wasted every night or something,it should be fine. Just call sis,tell her you didn\u2019t really think it through and give your nephew his first trip to France. You\u2019ll all have a blast. I\u2019ll give you an NTA just for not knowing any better.", "Idk thats a stretch\n\nWho wants to fly god knows how long with her baby on her lap\n\n\nShe just assumed, actually they both did\n\nBut i feel like if we planned the trip without the baby i can assume the baby isnt coming\n\nIts april now thats like 6mos\n\nAnd she didnt think to bring it up like okay now i have this baby how do we plan this out\n\nLike why does he have to drop his sh1t because of her baby", "That\u2019s my question too. Who is paying???", "part may be he's third wheeling already and doesn't want to get stuck babysitting", "We don't know where OP is based, a flight to Paris can be a pretty short one from many countries and it isn't especially unusual to take a baby on that sort of trip.", "It's not a newborn. The baby is roughly 5 months old now.", "We did Paris with kids at 8 months and then again with a 3 y/o and 13 month old. It\u2019s still an awesome place to visit and plenty of fun. We couldn\u2019t go to the clubs, but that wasn\u2019t really a loss for us anyway.", "I mean this person is also being a bit of an idiot by not realizing that their sister would be bringing her fairly young infant along. This is a NAH sitch for me", "assuming that OP\u2019s sister and husband are just trying to use OP for free babysitting while they have a romantic vacation is a massive reach TBH. like i get the sentiment because its happened in other post on this sub and is common IRL, but there\u2019s literally nothing in the post to indicate this sort of behavior from the sister?\n\nif anything the opposite is true because 1) the sister would probably just leave the baby at home with someone else and go on the vacation if she actually wanted to be away from the baby to have a free holiday, 2) in OP\u2019s hypothetical about his sister he implied she\u2019d be telling him to go out and have fun while she stays behind and watches the baby if the baby went on the trip with them", "What indication is there that he doesn't? They planned a trip as a family. That's actually very common.", "A child free vacation is not comparable in the slightest, and you\u2019re delusional if you think otherwise. It\u2019s great you and your sister had a great trip, but it\u2019s obvious this is NOT the trip OP had planned for. His sister didn\u2019t even check if this is something he\u2019s okay with. I would never travel with an infant for a vacation, that\u2019s the opposite of a holiday in my opinion. It\u2019s okay his sister wants to travel with her son, but it sounds like OP has accommodated more than enough and should enjoy his trip solo.\n\nNTA. 100% NTA.", "This is the best answer. The communication here is fucking awful. How on earth could they reschedule a trip and nobody thought to discuss that there was a whole new person involved? I\u2019m not saying OP should have to vacation with the baby, but did nobody think to have the discussion before rebooking?", "And yet Europeans manage to live and raise families in and around those old cramped buildings. It's not that difficult to carry a baby upstairs, you can use a sling if you want to be hands free.", "That's why they needed OP. Sherpa", "A 5 month old doesn\u2019t need a seat to themselves, and in fact most planes provide a bassinet for infants at this age. Paris is completely manageable with small children, I\u2019ve done it multiple times. The sister should absolutely not expect the OP to babysit, that would be unacceptable to impose, but otherwise I have no idea why the OP would assume that his sister would even want to travel without her 5 month old behind.", "I think being a parent will do that. But ok.", "You don't need her permission to go alone, but I think you probably should have politely backed out of a group trip when she canceled the first time and then just went on your own.", "*sigh*\nSee, you planned a trip for the \"all of us\": 3 of you. Not 4 of you. She reproduced and thus posponed the trip. And now you would be 4 for the trip\nThe thing with parents is that usually they come with their kids. So now it's almost close to two posibilities: you go alone or you add an unplanned extra baby to the trip. \nSo yeah, expect this from now on for almost every trip you organize. I would recommend to go on your own if you want it to happen (soon)", "That kid is going to be a part of her immediate concerns, and that includes planning trips, for the next eighteen years at least. That is the best case scenario.\n\nYou should have realized that when she announced the pregnancy. Did your mother go off on trips without you when they were under three? Do anybody's?\n\nEven if they did, it isn't what I would call \"usual\". People are, oddly enough, rather attached to our kids.", "Babies are portable, at five months it will sleep a lot in a carrier. There\u2019s no need to stay in the hotel room all the time.", "Not all moms breastfeed", "Mine were easier to travel with when small enough to wear.", "Nah unless I\u2019m doing a kid orientated vacation, vacationing with the kids is no fun for me. Too much work and stress, when I could be relaxing, as well as limitations on what I can do/experience. I get it some like traveling with kids, but it ain\u2019t for me. I also would hate traveling with someone else\u2019s kid.", "Why would his sister need to check with him about bringing the baby? Common sense would dictate that she would?", "Did you even read what I said about the buildings?", "No no they don\u2019t understand the realities of it until they travel", "Right...like...what", "Newborns use mom as a place of comfort because it\u2019s all they\u2019ve ever known. Voice, heartbeat, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to leave a new baby for an extended period of time, regardless of how it eats.", "Yeah it is the best time. Once they start to move on their own it\u2019s fucking awful on the plane for a bit.", "Babies need routine, not schedules. The entire market built up around making parents believe they need to impose a schedule on a newborn is a fucking racket.", "Oh please\ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd23. Newborns sleep all the time and don't gaf where", "Happy cake day!", "Common sense would be that an already planned child free vacation would stay the same, UNLESS otherwise discussed by the parents of said children.", "I mean, the kid is 5 months old. Very few parents want to be away from their brand new baby for that long.", "The baby could be breastfed only so there's one reason why the baby simply can't stay with just dad for multiple days at a time.", "Not necessarily true. I was the primary parent when we had a new born, while their mom worked nights. She was gone most of the week when they weren\u2019t in daycare and spending time with me. If the baby isn\u2019t breastfed, dad is more than capable of caring for his kid on his own", "We\u2019re not talking about a newborn if they were born in November.", "Correction: SOME newborns sleep all the time and don\u2019t gaf where. It\u2019s almost like\u2026 not everyone is exactly the same??", "I mean she got pregnant, of course the vacation would change. \n\nI think a conversation should\u2019ve happened here. OP is super naive as to think things wouldn\u2019t change, and maybe their sister is naive as to think her sibling would just be ok with the baby. \n\nCommon sense and communication here are lacking", "Don\u2019t they know that their parents need a break from taking care of them all the time? How dare they demand food and love 24/7!", "I agree - but to be fair, I'm surprised she wanted to go on a vacation with a baby less than a year old at all. My friends traveled a few times with their super young one - but those were all trips to visit older family who couldn't travel, not big Europe trips with someone would is probably wanting to do lots of touristy things and take full advantage of seeing the city.", "So are you saying your child\u2019s mom was actually still there in a capacity or that she was gone for extended periods of time (like days/weeks) in OP\u2019s case?", "\ud83d\ude44 yea 99% of newborns. Let me guess you have the exception \ud83e\udd23", "I took my babies on tons of trips to Bali and Thailand when they were less than a year, two months in one case, and it was fine (they were exclusively breastfeeding which made things easy). I was flying from Asia so this was more like flying half way across the US, but with the aspect that they are developing nations. Not for everyone but genuinely a lot easier than you might think. More sitting around your villa and less clubbing, obviously, but I brought my in-laws/mom so I did go out some.", "Eh, some women are very much up to traveling while the kid is still very small. Some moms hate it but don't have a choice. \n\nI was never one of those women (I was too tired to function, lol), but more power to those who are."]}
