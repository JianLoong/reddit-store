Most new parents don\u2019t want to leave a new baby home, though. Maybe you should go on your own or with a friend on this trip and plan a shorter weekend visit in your sister\u2019s town to have time together", "NAH. Go on your own.", "Info: who\u2019s paying for the trip I think matters here. If you\u2019re all paying for fair share, it\u2019s fair game. But if 1 person is paying for the whole thing, yeah they do get to set some expectations/boundaries for the trip. \n\nSounds like there was a mismatch in expectations for this new trip, you wanted to proceed as originally intended and the parents now have a baby to consider. Could simply be you just missed the opportunity to do Paris with your sister kid free, that\u2019s life.", "NAH.  I mean duh of course you don't want to go to Paris with a baby, that is a BUZZKILL.  But yeah, she also doesn't want to leave her infant behind.  Y'all should've gone while she was pregnant, or y'all need to hold off until she's comfortable leaving her kid behind.

Having a baby doesn't mean you cant strap them into a snugglie and go do all the things you wanted to start with. Western Europe is very acceptant of breastfeeding, you can whip a tit out almost anywhere. And toilets for changing diapers are available pretty much everywhere. Also, there are a metric ton of children running around the Eiffel tower. The viewing decks are even stroller friendly, with the exception of the top which you cant always bank on seeing anyways due to weather.   \n\n\nAll of you are too old to be out enjoying the clubbing scene(legal age in France is 18, clubs are packed with teens/early 20's and you will stand out as both older and foreign) so having a baby tag along wouldnt really change anything you'd most likely be doing anyways.", "Soft ESH. You can't count on her to be a part of the fun vacation you imagined pre-pregnancy  now that she has a baby to care for. She can't just leave a tiny baby at home, even with her husband. At the same time, she can't expect to bring a baby and have it be as fun for everyone as imagined before the baby was born. You would be better off going alone or with a friend.

It's a bit tone-deaf that you didn't realize that. But I get that having a baby along would make it a completely different vacation for you (as it would me) and that that's not what you want to do.

Also you can\u2019t control whether she brings the baby, but you can control whether you go with them at all.", "NTA - you already cancelled the trip once for the pregnancy and traveling with a baby def changes the whole trip vibe.

It's a whole different trip with a baby.", "YTA\n\nFirst you questioned her for not wanting to go on the vacation while pregnant.\n\nThen you assumed she would just leave her infant child behind to go on an international trip with you?  Seriously?\n\nStop pushing *your* vacation assumptions onto other people.  If you want a specific kind of trip, go by yourself.  Don\u2019t plan a trip and expect everyone else to fall in line with what you want - especially when what you want is for them to leave their kid behind!", "NTA. Just go.", "YTA and very wrong. This is one of the best times to travel with baby as he can\u2019t move, his food is easy to provide, he doesn\u2019t complain, he flies for free and him sleeping doesn\u2019t impede taking him places. I would reconsider the trip. My sister and I enjoyed bringing my son to all the festivals and restaurants in my tourist home town when he was tiny. Unless you want to do drugs or drink tons, a six month old doesn\u2019t change too much.

I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole for not assuming Daniel would be going with, probably naive. \n\nYou need to have an actual conversation with your sister and her husband about this trip. What everyone\u2019s expectations are, if the trip is going to happen, etc. You also need to apologize for not realizing that Daniel would also be going on the trip, whether you intended to or not, you obviously upset your sister and caused an argument.", "NAH.  I mean, it was kind of silly to think she\u2019d be ready to leave her baby.  However, obviously people won\u2019t want a baby on vacation unless it\u2019s already kid-oriented.  Both things just seem like common sense to me.  It would change the whole feel of the trip.  It\u2019d be way better to reschedule again or just not go together.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a parent so why would assume a baby would be fun. She\u2019s being silly if she thinks you want to travel with a baby.", "It would be best for them to go with the baby.

Go by tourself.", "YTA. You expect a mom who just had her baby 3 months go to leave it behind while she goes on a week long trip? That's insane.", "YTA\n\nDude - you should have talked to her *while she was pregnant* about your travel plans. Checked in with her again after the baby was born. You should not have assumed. This is on you.", "This is a joke right??", "YTA - You seriously think a new mother is going to leave the baby?  I can see not doing the trip as the baby will clearly change it, but expecting her and her husband to leave it behind makes you TA.", "YTA\n\nBut I get it, having a little kid on a vacation is not my idea of an enjoyable vacation either. The thing you need to understand is that your sister is in mom mode with mom brain and for a long time her the kid will be a package deal.\nIf you want private adult sibling time with her, that's probably not gonna happen for a while.", "Yup. Ya are OP. You don\u2019t seem to have any sense of how the blessed event may have changed the life and priorities of your sister. It\u2019s amazing she\u2019s going at all! But of course she\u2019s going to bring her tiny baby. The baby is very likely still nursing. It\u2019s not so simple, practically or emotionally, to ditch your brand new baby. It could be worked out, but she doesn\u2019t want to. Most people wouldn\u2019t. And you\u2019re not sensitive to that fact. Or much of anything as far as I can tell. YTA", "YTA for not realizing that the nature of the vacation would dramatically change. If you wanted an adult vacation you should have just gone yourself (or invited others along). It's not like your sister is going to drop her baby off at a kennel for the week!", "YTA but you won't understand this unless you have a baby one day yourself. It's just not possible to leave a newborn whether it's with her husband or a nanny or grandma. Even if she wanted to, no one understands how biologically difficult that is.

You\u2019ll have to get the baby a seat on the plane, then they\u2019re also going to have the baby on a plane for however long, then the absolute nightmare of having to transport the baby around the city. \n\nA lot of buildings in Europe are old and cramped, which means it\u2019ll be very difficult trying to care of the baby in the first place. A lot of the buildings/restaurants require you to go up and down the stairs for the bathroom, or if the first floor of the restaurant doesn\u2019t have any seating they\u2019ll try and sit you on the second floor. I\u2019ve had the joy of watching many a couple try and tough it out then give up because it was difficult. Trying to haul baby and everything for the baby up and down the stairs, multiple times a day, is very exhausting and time consuming and because a lot of these spaces are cramped, good luck finding somewhere to put the stroller. I saw many parents who were clearly on vacation with their babies just absolutely miserable. They are pretty good about having elevators in the public transit, but for the clueless parents it was also interesting seeing them try to get on the escalator with the stroller. \n\nYour sister needs to accept that the baby is somewhat limiting in what she can and can\u2019t do, and she\u2019ll have to wait until he\u2019s older to go. For you, absolutely you should go and make it a solo trip! Solo trips are the best because you\u2019re responsible for no one but yourself so you can do whatever you want. If she gets upset, too bad so sad, maybe she should\u2019ve thought about some of the things she wanted to do before having the baby. I\u2019m going to guess she didn\u2019t want to go while pregnant because of the limitations on food and alcohol, so wanted to wait until she could enjoy it. But then I also suspect that means she\u2019s be expecting you to also help with the baby. What\u2019s the point of going on a trip when all their attention and energy are going towards the baby? I\u2019m not saying all that to be harsh, just seen way too many parents on all of my international trips naively think they can just go on and live their merry lives plus baby when that\u2019s not how it works at all.

Please genuinely, explain it. Again, I'm not disagreeing, I genuinely don't understand. Of course I'm assuming there was nothing high risk since I didn't see it mentioned. \n\nAs for asking if they could leave the baby, again, I don't understand. I completely understand that new parents might not want to, but I don't get how it's offensive wonder why they won't leave a \u22486 month-old with grandparents or something. OP organized this trip and already catered to them by postponing it for so long. I think (due to their needs, etc) there is a reasonable expectation that an infant isn't a good international travel and sightseeing companion and therefore wouldn't be attending.\n\nCould OP have worded things better?

Op was oblivious to the fact that there was no way in hell sis was traveling without her baby. Op was kinda the AH for suggesting that. Sis wasn't the AH for assuming it was now a trip for 4, but maybe a bit of one for blowing up at Op for wanting to go alone.

After all, plan A was for her AND her husband to go, right? Ie, her family. When it changed to plan B it was natural for her to assume it would also include *her family.* And thinking she\u2019d leave her baby at home and go alone in any case is insane.

My baby would nap but sometimes she would go pick him up and go about doing things. Why wake a sleeping baby? Maybe her method worked for her but I felt it was at my baby's expense somewhat. I asked her to leave and not intentionally but for my own sanity, did things not on a schedule but a routine. Feedings and naps happening roughly at similar times. Allowed my baby a calm place to nap. And the difference was amazing. He calmed down and was reaching milestones faster. My point is, it's not impossible but it's not exactly strap on the baby in a carrier and go about your business as though it's life before baby.
