He would tell my mom how he loved her and promised to marry her. But he kept her a secret from others and eventually started a family with a different woman who his family viewed as being more \u201crespectable.\u201d\n\nChris would save face to others by playing the victim and saying how he loved me \u201cwith all his heart\u201d but my \u201cjealous\u201d mom kept me away from him \u201cout of spite.\u201d In reality, my mom would beg Chris to spend time with me. Many times when my mom thought I was asleep, I overheard her offering to pay Chris money just to visit me. There was more than one instance where Chris agreed, took the money, but then made an excuse and didn\u2019t come.\n\nOn the rare occasion that Chris did spend time with me, his dismissive actions and degrading comments toward me made it clear that I did not matter compared to his new children. As a teenager, I gave up on Chris and focused on healing and moving on. There\u2019s still a lot of pain that I am processing, since I spent so much of my childhood and adolescence chasing Chris\u2019s approval/acknowledgement and never getting it.\n\nChris and his wife are divorcing. I know because my half-brother Zander reached out to me recently. Zander (20M) brought my younger half-brother Joey (15M) to meet me. I reminded them of the way Chris treated me (they were often present and observed many of Chris\u2019 dismissive actions and degrading comments toward me.) But they were only willing to believe the version of Chris that they grew up with, insisting that he was a great father and that I should \u201cforgive\u201d him.\n\nZander asked to start having regular meetings. I explained that I was sorry, but I do not want to keep interacting with him and Joey. I need to focus on taking care of my own mental health right now, and I know it\u2019s going to be hurt by me interacting with the children who 1) Chris left me for and 2) keep insisting he was a great father and that I should forgive him.\n\nZander kept telling me to reconsider. Because their sister Tina is no longer with them and Joey is really hopeful/excited about having a sister again. (According to Zander, what happened to Tina has a big role in why Chris and his wife are separating.) I told Zander that I am sorry about all that is happening to him and Joey, but that he needs to find a different person to be Joey\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d sister because that person can\u2019t be me right now. Zander called me selfish and heartless.\n\nI was explaining the situation to an acquaintance, and she told me that I should have more empathy for Joey because he\u2019s a kid in an unfair family situation just like I was. And that I should make an effort since Joey just really wants to have a sister again.\n\nI think distance is kinder to both of us. I don\u2019t want to give Joey any more hope about having a sister again just for the relationship to likely turn sour or be cut off. And I don\u2019t think having empathy should mean putting myself in a position that I know will hurt my mental health.

I don't see any reason why you should have to have any further contact at all with them--block and focus on your own mental and emotional recovery.

This is just sad all around. You have every right to draw any boundaries you need to in order to take care of your own emotional health. Xander is gaslighting you about the circumstances of your own life and that is not healthy. As far as Joey goes, it is sad for him but ultimately not your responsibility. If they were willing to believe you when you talk about your own experience with your biological father, that would be one thing. However, since they don\u2019t, it is clearly unhealthy for you. Don\u2019t feel guilty about doing what you need to do to take care of yourself. There\u2019s also a chance that Chris is putting them both up to this, which would be really sick and twisted. Best of luck to you.", "NTA your father spent your whole life prioritizing these kids over you, and now they\u2019re used to that dynamic.

That is the responsibility of his parents. \n\nIt seems like your very different views of their father could cause tension and upset in the relationship in the long run anyway.", "NTA. You don't owe these boys anything. Nor do you need to sacrifice your mental health for them. Your sperm donor was a cruel AH & those are the memories you have of him. Not the warm & fuzzy ones your half-brothers have.", "NTA\n\nWow- your half-siblings are acting spoiled & entitled. You have no obligation whatsoever to either of them. You also have no obligation to your sperm donor or any of his offspring. Block them both. It\u2019s high time they learned that there are other people in the world aside from them. Your mental health is far more important than the whims of two entitled people.", "NTA. You were as cordial and polite and understanding as one can reasonably be expected to be in your situation.

Also I have a half sister I\u2019ve never even met, I wouldn\u2019t ever demand she have a relationship with me and insist she\u2019s selfish for not creating one. It\u2019s you right to let into your life who you want to. Would it be ideal if your father had some epiphany and genuinely changed and apologized and you all got together and became a happy family like a movie?

They are not even willing to concede that you had completely different experiences with your sperm donor.\n\nI don't even understand what they think a \"sister\" does or why they feel the need to have a strange female in their life for THEIR emotional comfort. Do they have some kind of expectation that you would provide services as the sister? \n\nAlso how did they \\*lose\\* their sister? Is she dead or just estranged?", "Nta but Zander is for pushing you and joey onto each other among other reasons", "NTA. Nobody has had empathy to you until the moment. You need to tell your friend that you were a kid in an unfair situation, too. You should not sacrifice yourself because for someone else.", "NTA, although these kids are not to blame for what Chris did. I do think it's weird for them to think that they can \"replace\" Tina with you. Your relationship with them would be very different than their relationship with Tina would be. But you've got a very good point about not promising things you can't offer. If you're not in an emotional place where you can keep contact with them without the relationship souring, then it IS better for you to keep your distance. Maybe later a relationship can grow naturally, but right now you seem to be aware of what your needs and boundaries are, and good for you for knowing and for sticking to them!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
