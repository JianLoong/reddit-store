This really isn't about the hat.)\n\nDid he even ask her for the hat back?  She'd be a huge AH if after cheating, she kept his stuff that he asked for back.  But if he never asked for it, between you and her, it's hers as something he left with her.\n\nI don't understand your comment about lice not being on the head?  Lice are on the head.  You'd be the AH if you give the hat back to your friend without telling him about the lice (if she's not lying), and he gets lice.\n\nBasically, just let it go.
