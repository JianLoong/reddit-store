So I just said, \"that's what I thought\" and I swiped off her head and turned to leave. She was shocked that I would be so blatant and berated me for being a jerk. She also claimed that she had lice to which I responded that if she did, they wouldn't be on her head.

I think I might be the asshole for taking something in her possession without her consent even though it didn't belong to her. I also insulted her in the process. \n2.

That's why I felt justified in taking it thought I'll admit I didn't go about it the right way.", "NTA\n\nI need friends like you in my life \ud83d\ude02 one of the boys for sure.\n\nYou done right by him, loyalty is rare these days. You had his back went shit went down and sounds like he went through it. If I saw someone that completely ruined one of my mates and fucked him over and they were just swanning through shopping living their best life wearing his belongings, damn straight I'd probably do the same.\n\nI know I'm being super petty and tbh I don't care, I'll always applaud a cheater getting karma, no matter the form.", "It's unlikely that she has lice if she's walking around in public, but as a dad who had to deal with a lice infestation that absolutely came from my kid sharing a hat with another who had lice, be careful.  The shampoo and combs were extremely unpleasant and I couldn't imagine having to do the combs on myself.  \n\nPut the hat in an airtight bag and store in a cool place.  Any lice on it will die with 1-2 days.", "Lmao, you're a good friend\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAnd you weren\u2019t stealing. You were retrieving stolen property.", "Info - did he give her the hat and did he want the hat back?", "Lol. I guess YTA, but I still support what you did", "NAH -- you were overzealous, and VERY funny.  \n\nDid he even ask her for the hat back?  She'd be a huge AH if after cheating, she kept his stuff that he asked for back.  But if he never asked for it, between you and her, it's hers as something he left with her.\n\nI don't understand your comment about lice not being on the head?  Lice are on the head.  You'd be the AH if you give the hat back to your friend without telling him about the lice (if she's not lying), and he gets lice.\n\nBasically, just let it go.  She cheated, they broke up, it's over.  You don't have to be friends with her ever, but don't go out of your way to keep harassing her.", "G move. Keep that shit up", "YTA for getting involved in someone else\u2019s drama but damn I laughed at that comeback.", "INFO - Either it\u2019s NTA or ESH depending on one answer. Did your friend feel she kept the hat against his wishes (did she basically steal it). \n\nIf no, ESH, she did him dirty and you want revenge. Hat seems like a nice easy target. But, yeah it\u2019s not your place to snatch a hat off her head. That could have gone really wrong had she thought you were striking her. Someone came at me like that my mind would go to \u2018I\u2019m about to get hit\u2019 not he\u2019s going for my hat. \n\nIf yes, she stole it, NTA you righted a wrong and stood up for your friend. Still very sketchy on snatching the hat off her head though.", "NTA \n\nBut I have to say that within he context of what we are given. For all I know your friend didn\u2019t ask for the hat back and didn\u2019t care about it but with what you gave us I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong. She admitted it was his, and you rightfully took it back. But if he didn\u2019t care about it and you still went and did it then that just makes you seem like a jerk because he\u2019s trying to leave it all behind him.", "ESH. This could have gone very badly for you (depending upon interpretations: theft, assault). You're lucky.", "ESH. She is obviously for cheating but snatching a hat off someone's head when you weren't even the person wronged is crazy", "YTA\n\nThat's a very petty and childish thing to do.", "YTA You could have handled that waaaaay better.", "YTA. Would you have had the balls to it to a man? Seems to me you're bragging about stealing clothes from a woman and calling her sexual hygiene into question in a public place.
