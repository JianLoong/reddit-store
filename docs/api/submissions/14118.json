From that day on Piper did not like Nancy. Because of that incident my brother and Nancy's mom met.

I said he and his wife started dating and Nancy hadn't even apologized and then Piper was still upset about who he was dating and Nancy being in her life more when they got married. I told him at no point did he try to make what happened better for Piper. He thought his marriage license would somehow erase the hurt Piper felt and the bullying Nancy put Piper through for more than a year. I said MAYBE if he had given it time, let Nancy apologize and given the girls space where they weren't living together to interact outside of school, things could have happened. But you had one child who was hurt and angry and another who was eager to have a dad and sibling after only having her mom.\n\nMy brother said I expected him to let Piper dictate his life. I said no, not what I said, I said if he wanted Piper to be happy and embrace Nancy as a sibling, then he should have taken things more slowly, to get that outcome.

Yeah god forbid a parent be expected to prioritize their child's wellbeing or anything. \n\nWhat your brother needs to realize is that sure, he *can* refuse to give a shit about his teenage daughter.

It seems like a pretty fair and obvious assessment. Your brother probably responded to you in an upset way because there\u2019s just not much he can do about it now and it\u2019s effectively made the family dynamic completely lame for Piper. It\u2019s too bad he is not taking accountability for what he did, even if he did have the best intentions - which is probably why he doesn\u2019t feel wrong. \n\nKids can definitely internalize a need to apologize for years and years and an apology is all it would take to mend a rift. If you or your brother can keep encouraging Nancy to apologize, I think it could make a difference.", "NTA - He\u2019s defensive because he knows that you\u2019re right.", "NTA.

The fact that her dad doesn't even care that she's upset is just awful. Poor Piper.", "NAH. Not that your brother would take your advice now, but he and Piper should be in family therapy together so that Piper can communicate her feelings to her dad in a safe space.\n\nAt the very least, Piper should be in therapy so she can process her feelings about losing her mom at such a young age.

I think the tendency of adult sisters who don't get along is due to a lot of traditional cultural norms, like stronger expectations for women to stay closer to their families of origin, and greater expectations for daughters to take care of aging parents, which itself is a stressful situation that can exacerbate strained relationships as sisters have to work out who will be responsible for what aspect of caring for the parents.\n\nMy wife is an only child, and my MIL is a real nightmare, I've often said I wish my wife had at least one sibling who we could be a unified front with when setting boundaries, to show it's not just my wife and me being unreasonable, like I have always been fortunate to have with my brothers when dealing with my parents, but truth be told, it's a coin toss whether having a sibling would have made things better or worse for my wife.

I'm still saltly about my sister opening and scratching my first album before I ever got to listen to it. It's more than just the photo, it's the bullying that preceded it.

This isn't a dig, this is heartbreaking to see", "**NTA**\n\nYour brother needed to hear why his family relationships are the way they are. You wrote eloquently and seem to have been empathetic in your analysis. Piper was bullied and persecuted. Nancy went after something she treasured. She took aim at Pipers most vulnrable point and in response you brought Nancy and her mum into your lives. This was  a major betrayal of Piper whether OPs brother likes it or not.\nIt was never about dictating his life. It was about his duty towards his daughter. To protect her from harm. To provide her safety, security, understanding, empathy and love. By bringing her tormentor into their lives he failed her on a very basic very fundemental level. And why? because he fancied Nancy's mum?! \n\nHonestly OP your brother sucks and needs to see it unless he wants to lose Piper all together as she matures into adulthood.", "NTA, I\u2019m pretty sure the words that I want to use for your brother aren\u2019t allowed by this subreddit\u2019s rules but he obviously doesn\u2019t operate with the quickest mind. Doesn\u2019t sound like he didn\u2019t want the truth, just wanted you to coddle his feelings and tell him he was doing the best he could(which would be a boldfaced lie); so make sure you sit down with Piper and tell her that you\u2019ll always be there for her. I can only imagine it\u2019s going to come as a \u201cshock\u201d to him when Piper doesn\u2019t want anything to do with him once she\u2019s 18. Let her know that at least one of the adults in her life supports and stands by her, what a terrible situation to be put into after losing your mom.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Nancy never really got punished or that people didn\u2019t made Piper feel like her emotions were valid. In Piper\u2019s eyes, her dad literally brought her bully home and made Nancy \u2018legally\u2019 apart of her family. Logically explain how being sisters will erase the bullying Nancy has done? Siblings relationship are weird and different for every group and pair, and you can\u2019t say that making them sisters will do anything. There\u2019s half-siblings who aren\u2019t close and never actually bullied each other. Sometimes they get along and sometimes they don\u2019t, but you can\u2019t expect Piper to want to spend time with Nancy when all the time she has spent was Nancy being her bully. \n\nShe\u2019s still hurt \u2014 and she has every right to be. \n\nOf course, she\u2019s not going to trust Nancy with anything important, and why should she? Nancy did something that was messed up \u2014 and I don\u2019t care if they were kids at the time because that doesn\u2019t make it ok. There\u2019s a difference calling someone names and actually damaging something; I mean, both are bad, but with damaging something you can\u2019t be \u2018they don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying or doing.\u2019 She destroyed something that Piper had a lot of value in. More importantly, Nancy basically \u2018destroyed her mom\u2019 and then suddenly her mom is now Piper\u2019s mom. \n\nHow would Nancy\u2019s mom deal with me this situation if Piper was the bully? I doubt it would be the same way. If Nancy\u2019s mom wants them to be sisters, then is needs to treat Piper as a daughter and actually do what she needs to do to discipline her biological daughter. Just because they\u2019re now sisters doesn\u2019t mean their history is gone and they get away with sibling arguments and fights. It will never me a sibling fight for Piper because even when Nancy wasn\u2019t her step-sister, her dad picked Nancy over her. Both Piper\u2019s dad and Nancy\u2019s mom is at fault for not taking action on this - and honestly, there are the A H. \n\nHonestly, when you have kids, your life starts to circle around them. My parents have sacrificed so many things so my siblings and I get things and get to do things. However, this isn\u2019t some soccer tournament or toy that might be too expensive, this is his daughter\u2019s well-being and comfort and the changing relationship with her dad \u2014 and unfortunately for her, the relationship with her new mom who happened to be the mother of the daughter that bullied her and her bully when she is still hurt and no one has taken accountability for their actions.\n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. You brother mentioned something and you responded with why you think that happened.

The other 10 months, I was more of a third parent than a sibling for her. I shared the duty with my mom and step dad instead of solely acting as her mom like I did when we were at Ed\u2019s. Basically, I was very actively involved in my sisters upbringing. We have fought nastily.

Even if this situation was not ideal, parenting is difficult and not everyone is able to frame all of their actions in such a rational and informed way. You are certainly blameless here, and you have gone the extra mile already, but, honestly, your parents might also be blameless.

Thank you for defending her corner when she probably feels like no one else is. \n\nMy father had an affair and my mother died soon after. A month after her funeral began countless, unwanted, and forced interactions with AP and her family when we still had yet to process our grief. My siblings and I always felt our dad put the desires of himself, his gf, and her kids first. Without taking any steps to confront and discuss the last few years, they're engaged, and her kids are up in arms that we maintain distance from them. After all this he expects our issues with his affair partner to dissolve somehow, and it's almost comical how he looks at us with a surprised pikachu face when we tell him we'd rather spend holidays with our mom's relatives. \n\nI think that, like my father, your brother prioritized a new romantic partner without wanting to acknowledge the direct offense he took against his daughter, and do the emotional work needed to amend their relationship before the MASSIVE step of marriage. The validity of a relationship does not and *should not* rely on a marriage license, and there is little logical reason why he couldn't have waited longer to propose. It's probably a tough pill to swallow when you find happiness at the expense of someone else but that's his ***daughter.*** And he married ***the mother of her bully that she is now forced to live with.*** To say that was a tone deaf move is an obscene understatement and all of Piper's feelings are more than valid. \n\nI really do feel for Piper.

And three of her kids lived with her(they were adults by this time). So our first time spending time with dad and her together, we felt like outsiders.

Which meant essentially that they got to pick a cake and dinner and my name was also thrown in. I hated every second and never spent another birthday over there. To this day, I have almost no relationship with any of them outside of dad and stepmom. \n\nYour brother was foolish to think the girls would suddenly develop a relationship while putting no work in. Now he gets to reap the consequences.

The 7 year old started hating me about a year later, by the time they were 16 they took off and I've not heard from them since. That leaves just myself and my now nearly 15 year old. So here's the thing, dating has always been hard. I tried to consider the kids' feelings and always told them no one would ever replace their dad. The guy I'm with now has been very patient, we started dating at the end of 2018, he knows I've got no intention of living with him until my teen is an adult. 14-15 is HARD!

It's a different relationship and the parents should not push people to relate in a way they aren't comfortable.\n\nTwo adults getting married does nothing to build a relationship between their separate, unrelated children. In your brother's case, his daughter started out hurt and angry at her \"sister\" - and it seems that at no point did anyone apologise, attempt to console her, or anything else.

You were right about taking it slowly, I just don't get how he thought it would be fine to go from a year of torment, including ripping up a valued photo, to having them in your family. How would he expect her not to be mad? This might work in some Disney Movie, but not in real life. Going from bully to friend is not that simple. How could he just so coldly disregard her feelings?", "NTA. Again and again I see parents putting themselves before their kids like this and expecting the perfect outcome. I barely knew my step siblings before my parents got married, and there was animosity from the start. There was no adjustment period. I don't dislike any of my siblings - I love them deeply and wish great things for them - but we don't talk. We all grew up to be good people, but it's difficult to interact long because of all of the badly handled trauma that came from throwing two very incompatible families together. I coped by trying to juggle everyone's feelings at all times to keep the peace, and I'd have embarrassing emotional outbursts from built up tension. My parents and I have a lot of healing to do, but it's going well so far because they recognize the mistakes they made and genuinely love their kids.

I am a victim of bullying myself, and 30 years later am still unable to have any kind of relationship with my former bullies.  \nThe thing that Nancy never apologizes for her actions.  \nThat alone is enough to make Piper never want her in her life.  \nWhat your brother has not taken into account is that Nancy has actually traumatized his daughter and this kind of thing not only requires time, but also help. What Nancy has had about loneliness issues as an only child of a single mother are explanations, not excuses and not at all a good reason for what she did.  \nAs a lay person, my best advice is therapy for the whole family and lowering expectations for a happy family life.  \nOtherwise, it will probably end up with a LC/NC relationship with Piper, as per her wish!  \nKeep sticking with Piper, she needs sensible adults in her life <3", "You\u2019re the one being realistic here.

He finally found someone he is happy with, and he rushed in too quickly, and now he feels guilty because he likely knows its made his daughter unhappy. It makes a person defensive, he probably feels torn, as if he can only be a good Dad by sacrificing his happiness. It's a hard thing grappling with these feelings, and many don't handle it well. If you can see it from that perspective, you might be able to have a heart to heart with him. Explain that you were trying to be honest with him, that you're worried for his daughter, and it may have come out more harshly than you meant it. Let him know that the situation isn't lost.
