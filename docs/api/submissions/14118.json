When Piper was 4 her mom died. My brother told Piper so much about her and they had some special photos of her mom that were treasured. When Piper was 6 she started being teased by this girl call Nancy (15f now). It continued on for over a year and ultimately came to a head when Nancy tore up a photo of Piper's mom that Piper brought into school for some show and tell family edition her class was doing. From that day on Piper did not like Nancy. Because of that incident my brother and Nancy's mom met. They became friends and a few months after the incident where Nancy tore up the photo, they started dating and they married a year later. Piper pulled away from my brother when she found out he was dating Nancy's mom and even more when they moved in together and got married.\n\nNancy was actually happy and tried to get close to Piper. But Piper wanted nothing to do with that. Nancy's mom mentioned how being sisters would mend the rift and I thought that was kind of crazy given what went down.\n\nMy brother only mentioned to me recently that he really thought Piper and Nancy would be sisters and would be close by now. But Piper doesn't want anything to do with Nancy still and doesn't trust her around anything important.\n\nI told my brother that's because he moved too fast to get that kind of relationship with them. I said he and his wife started dating and Nancy hadn't even apologized and then Piper was still upset about who he was dating and Nancy being in her life more when they got married. I told him at no point did he try to make what happened better for Piper. He thought his marriage license would somehow erase the hurt Piper felt and the bullying Nancy put Piper through for more than a year. I said MAYBE if he had given it time, let Nancy apologize and given the girls space where they weren't living together to interact outside of school, things could have happened. But you had one child who was hurt and angry and another who was eager to have a dad and sibling after only having her mom.\n\nMy brother said I expected him to let Piper dictate his life. I said no, not what I said, I said if he wanted Piper to be happy and embrace Nancy as a sibling, then he should have taken things more slowly, to get that outcome. He told me it was none of my business and I was overstepping and just his little sister.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680778080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dg89z/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_moved_too_fast_for/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother sucks and needed to hear it. \"Being sisters will mend the rift\" is the kind of bullshit rationalization people make when they don't want to face how disgusting it is that they are bringing Piper's bully into her home, into her *family*. \n\n>My brother said I expected him to let Piper dictate his life. \n\nUGH. Yeah god forbid a parent be expected to prioritize their child's wellbeing or anything. \n\nWhat your brother needs to realize is that sure, he *can* refuse to give a shit about his teenage daughter. But Piper is fast approaching the age of legal adulthood, when he can no longer dictate *her* life. I think he'll be in for a rude awakening when his daughter drops him just as coldly as he's dropped her.", "NTA. He shoved aside his daughter's feelings for his own personal happiness. I think it's incredibly gross he even started being friends with the parent of his daughter's bully much less dating and then marrying her.  Did they tell this lovely how they met story at the wedding? He's probably permanently damaged his relationship with his daughter. \n\nAnd your brother is the one who brought it up, you didn't just say this out of nowhere. If it wasn't your business then maybe he shouldn't have been talking about it with you. He's just mad you called out his bullshit.", "NTA\n\nYour brother began dating and married the mother of his daughter\u2019s school bully?  Isn\u2019t this the plot of a 90s horror movie?", "He didn't like what you said because you were right and he knows that. NTA", "NTA. So many people imagine that if they construct a fantasy it will become a reality just because they want it to.\n\n>My brother said I expected him to let Piper dictate his life.\n\nHe gets to dictate hers but he's not prepared to show her any consideration at all.\n\n>He told me it was none of my business and I was overstepping and just his little sister.\n\nWhy did he talk to you about it? What he really means is, \"What didn't you tell me what I wanted to hear?\"", "This is going to come full circle when Piper goes low/no contact once she is old enough to leave home. People do not magically embrace their unapologetic bullies because their parents decided to shack up and force them into a sibling style relationship. This whole dynamic is probably a nightmare come true for Piper. You are right on all fronts, but there's very little he can do now to mend the situation, which he massively fumbled, so I understand why he would rather play dumb. NTA.", "NTA. Oh my god......... Poor Piper.", "NTA.  Brother is an idiot who alienated his daughter by falling for her bully's mom at first sight.  No surprise he's also a jerk.", "NTA\n\nYour brother put his needs before his daughter and didn't care what this would mean going forward. \n\nI think you're absolutely right.", "NTA. You brother trampled over all his daughter's feelings. He betrayed his daughter's trust the moment he brought perceived danger (her bully) into her home. He even feels entitled to the bully and the victim becoming friend *just to make him happy*.\n\nAnd it's you who overstepped? He deserves to be arrested for disrespecting all his daughter's reasonable boundaries in my opinion.", "NTA, you were definitely in the right to tell him what was true, remember she\u2019s *your niece* as well as *his daughter* who he isn\u2019t treating well, if he\u2019s not taking care of her it is absolutely your business", "NTA. Your brother is being ridiculous. He put on his rose colored glasses and expected everything to be hunky dory. He\u2019ll be wondering why piper goes low to no contact when she turns 18. Be as supportive as you can be for her and be a safe space for her if you can. Piper deserves better and she deserved better when your brother decided to marry her bully\u2019s mother.", "NTA, \n\nliteral nightmare. Having your own bully as a step-sibling? I would try to move out as fast as possible. Poor girl, you're in every right to criticize your brother in that aspect.", "NTA. Your brother was impulsive", "NTA\n\nThank you for having your nieces back. Your brother is thinking only of himself and his own needs. He probably thought that the teasing was just a little bit of fun and hasn't realized in all these years later the lasting impact its had on his daughter.\n\nWhy has he allowed the situation to go on for so many years without any attempt to rectify it? Does he enjoy watching his daughter suffer? Does he want to erase his late wife's memory so is just waiting for Piper to get out of his life so he can enjoy his happy new family?", "NTA I\u2019m sorry but if that was my dad I would view it as the ultimate betrayal and would be counting down the days till I hit 18 to move out and never look back.", "NTA, shouldn't have come to you to whine about the situation. It's great that your niece had someone who stands up for her.", "NTA. He brought it up, so it's not like you jumped in with an opinion out of the blue.\n\nI hope Piper knows she can talk to you, it sounds like nobody in her own home is on her side.", "NTA. It seems like a pretty fair and obvious assessment. Your brother probably responded to you in an upset way because there\u2019s just not much he can do about it now and it\u2019s effectively made the family dynamic completely lame for Piper. It\u2019s too bad he is not taking accountability for what he did, even if he did have the best intentions - which is probably why he doesn\u2019t feel wrong. \n\nKids can definitely internalize a need to apologize for years and years and an apology is all it would take to mend a rift. If you or your brother can keep encouraging Nancy to apologize, I think it could make a difference.", "NTA - He\u2019s defensive because he knows that you\u2019re right.", "NTA. Piper prob feels as if her dad has abandoned her and gone to make house with her bully, replacing her mother to boot. I hope she gets all the therapy she needs. Your brother shouldn\u2019t have asked you if he didn\u2019t want to hear opinions he doesn\u2019t like! It must be very tough to hear the truth of what he\u2019s done, but nowhere near as tough as Piper has had it all this time.", "Bad parents when they're faced with constructive criticism: \"sh0uLd i lEt mY chIlD diCTatE h0w i lIvE mY lIfe thEn??\u00bf\u00bf??\u00bf\u00bf!!\u00a1\u00a1!!\u00a1\u00a1\"\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly his relationship with piper will never recover! I\u2019m sure he knew the discomfort she felt when he dated Nancy\u2019s mom then he married her. Once she\u2019s of age she\u2019ll leave & cut him off!", "Amazing. You reap what you sow, NTA. Poor Piper.", "NTA - quite apart from anything else, it sounds like your brother raised the topic, then tried to claim it was none of your business when you told him something he didn't want to hear. That's always annoying.", "NTA I can't imagine my living parent marrying the mother of a child that tore up one of my most precious possessions. The fact that her dad doesn't even care that she's upset is just awful. Poor Piper.", "NAH. Not that your brother would take your advice now, but he and Piper should be in family therapy together so that Piper can communicate her feelings to her dad in a safe space.\n\nAt the very least, Piper should be in therapy so she can process her feelings about losing her mom at such a young age. That is the biggest elephant in the room in my opinion, since it doesn\u2019t sound like Piper\u2019s dad tells her stories about her mom much anymore.", "NTA - sounds like a midday movie except there\u2019s someone usually crying in a darkly lit lounge room brandishing a gun", "The softest possible YTA, because I think you are right in everything except telling this to your brother.

He could apologize to his daughter and perhaps go to family counseling with her to try to repair the damage he did with his thoughtless decisions.

Someone needs to advocate for Piper, especially if her only living parent is unwilling to do so.", "I agree, the case of hindsight bias.\n\nRight now the situation is what it is and they have to work with what they got, since you can't turn back time.\n\nI'll preface this with that ofc it is not OPs responsibility to be this families councler. There is no info mentioned about the conversations had with the children, but perhaps the father could try validating Pipers feelings and together with her think of a plan to make this family unit work. What are her boundries and what does she think is needed to mend the relationship. Both of the children are at an age where they could definitely contribute to solving this.  \nEdit: Mixed up Piper with Nancy, now fixed.", "She's also the aunt of a child who lost her mother and then had to deal with her bully being moved into the house. Moreover, her brother brought the issue up in the first place, it wasn't exactly unsolicited, and she's not in the wrong to advocate for the child's point of view.", "Honestly -- I don't blame Piper one bit if she's pulled back from your brother. What Nancy did was cruel, but what your brother did was a *betrayal*. Piper should have been able to trust her own father not to bring a bully into her home and family. Having your father let you down like that is far more painful than dealing with some random jerk in class.", "I don't think it's just Nancy she doesn't trust if I'm honest.\n\nSmart girl.", "Poor thing. Are you close with her? Does she feel safe coming to you with personal issues? It\u2019s important she has some solid support on which she can rely.", "It's good that he still does, but now I'm imagining that happening around the breakfast table where she is forced to share these precious stories about her mom with the bully who destroyed an irreplaceable photo of her. That poor girl.", "My heart breaks for Piper.  I\u2019m glad she has someone in the family who is looking out for her.  Hopefully she knows you are a safe space.", "He could also expect Nancy to apologize for her behavior. Yes now it's ancient history but not for Piper. I bet they didn't even have any family therapy let alone expect a simple apology from the bully that brought them together.  \n\nYour brother is incredibly tone deaf to not realize what the issue is. Is Nancy always polite to Piper now and does her mother treat Piper with respect? \n\nDon't listen to the people who say it's not your business. When it comes to your niece it is your business as nobody else is on her side.  Would you be able to have Piper stay over for weekends for some respite? I hope you can convince your brother to get your niece some counseling.", "> I agree, the case of hindsight bias.\n\nWhat? Absolutely not. The strained family relationship was EXTREMELY predictable. In fact, I would say it was the most predictable outcome of this situation.\n\nOP's brother knew that Nancy tore up an extremely valuable memento of Piper's dead mother -- that's the entire reason he met Nancy's mother in the first place. Blending families is a challenge under the best of circumstances, let alone in a situation where the parents met because one child bullied the other in such a cruel way. Anyone with the emotional intelligence of a tube worm could predict that trying to get Nancy and Piper to be stepsisters would be hurtful to Piper, unless a SERIOUS effort was made to get these girls into therapy and repair the relationship. \n\nBrother and Nancy's mom seem not to have done any of that work -- they just merrily told themselves \"we'll all be FAMILY and everything will work out!\" That's magical thinking at best and a selfish cop-out at worst. \n\nOP's brother got into this situation by deluding himself about his own responsibilities to his daughter, and he's not going to get out of it until he faces up to his part in creating the situation. OP was absolutely right to call him out on it. Too bad if it was hard for him to hear. Welcome to life, sometimes you need to hear difficult things in order to move forward.", "Validating Nancy\u2019s feelings? Why? Or did you mean Piper.", "Well then were was OP with their analisys of the situation back then? Everyone can throw around phrases about it being very predictible, when years have passed. If the problem is my use of \"hindsight bias\", okay i'm not dying on that hill. Additionally, I am not justifying the actions of the father. But that is not even up for discussion, the discussion is about OP's action. In this case- very poorly timed, in my opinion.", "sorry, yes! Piper!", "Well OP didn't fully choose the timing. The brother chose to complain about the relationship between his daughter and step-daughter, so OP responded with the truth. There's no statute of limitations on giving someone a reality check.\n\nIf OP's brother *actually* cares about the state of his family, he needs to be able to hear OP's feedback, even when it's hard. If he would rather be falsely gassed up and live in the fantasy that he's done nothing wrong, well, that's exactly the kind of thinking that got him into the situation in the first place. \n\nEither way, OP is not the AH for trying to get him on the right track while he still has time to repair the relationship with his child."]}
