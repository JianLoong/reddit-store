For the past couple weeks random lyft charges were appearing on my credit card. I asked my sister was it her, as she\u2019s one of the few people I gave my credit card info to, but she said it wasn\u2019t her. I cancelled my card and ordered a new one, but lyft charges were still appearing. \n\nThe two most recent charges were on Christmas and Tuesday. On Christmas, I saw a charge come through from lyft and I asked my sister did she request a lyft and she said no that she was getting picked up(she was headed to her boyfriend house). I believe her and assumed someone was using my card again. On Tuesday, I was at work and once again I saw a lyft charge on my credit card. This time I had a feeling it was my sister, so I tracked her on find my iPhone and saw that she was moving at car speed from her boyfriend\u2019s house to our house. I waited until I got home to ask her about it. When I got home, I asked for her phone to see if she had lyft, She stalled(I suspect she deleted it before handing it to me). She denied not only using lyft and but having it on her phone and said she walked home. A COMPLETE LIE I LITERALLY TRACKED HER! it pissed me off, but I let it go. \n\nWell, today I was using my deceased mother\u2019s phone and happened to see my sister was logged into her email. On a whim I looked up lyft and lo and behold both lyft charges appeared under her lyft account. I was met was pure sadness and angry. I sent her the proof that she used my card and she said she will pay me back. \n\nIm quite disturbed for many reasons. 1. Even if she was using lyft and accidentally charged my card, why lie in the first place about having lyft????? 2. Whenever I brought up someone possibly using my card without permission she showed sympathy and offered to give me money for those unknown charges WHEN IT WAS HER THE WHOLE TIME. I know this seem minute but I don\u2019t think I can ever look at my sister the same way. Lying about something so small and sending me on a wild goose chase to figure out what was going on with my card is pure lunacy. \n\nAnyway, I plan on never giving her money again.

I\u2019m sorry your sister is stealing from you. \n\nYou can go to the police, but I would recommend doing that only if she doesn\u2019t pay you back OR if she does it again. And I would tell her these will be the consequences. \n\nIf you dispute the charges with the credit card company, they will probably remove them. But you may have to file a police report for that\u2026especially if the company contacts Lyft and sees rides are starting and ending from your house. \n\nBe careful she doesn\u2019t try to steal your identity.

Do whatever you have to do to prevent unauthorized use of your credit card \u2014 change the account number, change companies altogether, whatever it takes to prevent other people using your card. Never, never, *EVER* give the card number to anyone, not your sister,  not a friend, not another family member.

I'm afraid you're going to have difficulty in getting her realise the seriousness of having lost a sister's trust.

If you want to buy something for them, buy it for them. Don\u2019t just give them your card. As you\u2019ve learned, once you start sharing your card info you have no control over what people will do with it.\n\n2) if you ever see charges on your card you can\u2019t account for, call your credit card company and report the card has been stolen. Even if it\u2019s a small charge. Sometimes scammers will put a small charge on the card to see if you\u2019ll catch it, then if you don\u2019t they start buying big stuff. \n\nIn this case even though you already canceled the card you should do it again, as you said you were still getting unauthorized charges after you got a new card.

You do need to take steps to ensure that your credit card(s) and other access to your accounts are protected from her.  If the abuse continues and you opt to dispute the charges, the credit card company will ask you if you shared your credit card info or allowed her to use your card.  I worked in banking for a long time and dealt with fraud and forgery.  Banks will place the responsibility of protecting your account information on you and might refuse to reimburse you if you have not protected all of your account information.
