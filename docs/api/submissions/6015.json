I cancelled my card and ordered a new one, but lyft charges were still appearing. \n\nThe two most recent charges were on Christmas and Tuesday. On Christmas, I saw a charge come through from lyft and I asked my sister did she request a lyft and she said no that she was getting picked up(she was headed to her boyfriend house). I believe her and assumed someone was using my card again. On Tuesday, I was at work and once again I saw a lyft charge on my credit card. This time I had a feeling it was my sister, so I tracked her on find my iPhone and saw that she was moving at car speed from her boyfriend\u2019s house to our house. I waited until I got home to ask her about it. When I got home, I asked for her phone to see if she had lyft, She stalled(I suspect she deleted it before handing it to me). She denied not only using lyft and but having it on her phone and said she walked home. A COMPLETE LIE I LITERALLY TRACKED HER! it pissed me off, but I let it go. \n\nWell, today I was using my deceased mother\u2019s phone and happened to see my sister was logged into her email. On a whim I looked up lyft and lo and behold both lyft charges appeared under her lyft account. I was met was pure sadness and angry. I sent her the proof that she used my card and she said she will pay me back. \n\nIm quite disturbed for many reasons. 1. Even if she was using lyft and accidentally charged my card, why lie in the first place about having lyft????? 2. Whenever I brought up someone possibly using my card without permission she showed sympathy and offered to give me money for those unknown charges WHEN IT WAS HER THE WHOLE TIME.
