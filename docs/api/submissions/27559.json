Later in the week, after dinner, my husband asked my son who the dance. He asked if he danced, my son said no. \n\nIn more of a humorous voice, he asked if he checked out girls. Our son was kind of quiet. Then my husband said \u201cMiddle school is when kids start developing\u2026\u201d (then he paused and gestured with his hands in a way that indicates breasts)\u201d\u2026 personality.\u201d He started laughing.  \nI shot him a look that was intended to say please stop, not cool, and turned around to do the dishes. My son was not looking at me when I shot the look, but since I didn't laugh it was probably clear that I didn't like the joke. I was going to let it go and probably bring it up later. Then my husband said to me, \u201cCome on, that was funny, admit it.\u201d  I told him I didn\u2019t find it funny and that I don\u2019t like jokes that I feel like they are objectify women.  \nHe later told me he was trying to normalize sexual development and being attracted to breasts as a middle school boy (my son is attracted to girls). He doesn\u2019t think what he said is objectifying and I shouldn't have found it offensive. \n\nI shared that I also support normalizing his development/curiosity and that we can do that without making jokes that focus on girls\u2019 anatomy being what makes her attractive. And I don\u2019t want him to make comments that wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to make in front of his female friends. \n\nI\u2019m concerned about the message he\u2019s sending our son with jokes like this (this was not the first). He said I was being over the top, exaggerating, and he will joke with our son how he wants to. He went on to say if this is how our culture is now, he doesn't want to be part of it. \n\nHe said my being stern about the situation instead of just laughing along made it uncomfortable/awkward for our son and brought the opposite of the lightness he wants our son to feel about sexuality.

Frankly, I found what your husband said remarkably puerile, like the only reason a male develops an attraction to females is because of their breasts. \n\nHe wasn't just \"normalizing sexual development.\" He was being a real Beavis and Butthead. It's not just that he shouldn't have said it to your 12 year old son. He shouldn't have said it to anybody. Unless he doesn't mind having people laugh at him.\n\nYou were far more polite than I would've been. I probably would've snapped back something like, \"Yes, the ways girls start checking out your growing cock and balls!\" See how he likes that.\n\nYour being \"stern\" didn't make it awkward for your son. Just about any discussion of sex with one's parents at that age can be embarrassing.\n\nTell your husband to stop being such an immature jerk.", "NTA, it is objectifying. You are right, there are plenty of ways to normalize this stuff without making girls the butt of a fuckin joke. \n\nAlso.....he is talking about children's breasts.....in a creepy way....fuckin gross.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is way, way out of line. Not okay at all to be talking about girls/women this way especially to a male child who is learning from him as a role model. It is extremely disrespectful. I mean JFC big breasts = \u201cpersonality\u201d seriously? The addition of a grown ass man speaking about and to children this way - gross. Also, what if your son is not into girls because he is not yet there or because he is interested in boys? This will make him less open, not more and make him feel unsafe to discuss. This was not funny and troubling. \n\nSorry you\u2019re dealing with this and good luck - stick to your guns.", "NTA\n\nThe joke is not a humorous way to normalize body development. Rather, the joke contributes to your son being taught that it's okay to objectify and sexualize girls.\n\nYou and your husband are raising your son together and you both need to be ok with what values are being taught to him by the other. If these kind of jokes cross your boundaries, then you are well within your rights to tell your husband not to do that. In my view, that has nothing to do with imposing your values on him.", "NTA\nEw. Your husband thinks it's okay to objectify and sexualize 12 year old girls. His idea of relating to your son, at what he's modeling he expects his pov to be, is misogynistic and creepy. Those aren't good life lessons. Kudos to OP for objecting to demeaning girls in front of their child.", "NTA. Reducing the interest your son may have in girls to their breasts is dehumanizing and not funny. In addition, I would hope that your husband would listen to you with an open mind and respect and not outright dismiss your views. That's an even bigger problem than reducing the attraction to girls (and girls themselves) to their body parts. Or maybe an equal problem. It's hard to believe that there haven't been other signs of his creepy \"humour\" or lack of respect for your experiences and views - whether on how best to raise a boy/young man or in other areas.", "NTA... absolutely nothing wrong with teaching your son early to respect, and always be respectful, to / about women...\n\nI was undecided at first if your husband crossed a line with his joke... but then reread your post, and think, yeah, he's being an AH here... particularly for doubling down on it, and saying \"if this is how our culture is now...\"", "NTA.  Partly because of what you\u2019re saying about objectification and the negative lesson it teaches your son, but MOSTLY because this is a guy in presumably his 30s or 40s talking about the bodies of 12/13 year old girls in an incredibly creepy way.\n\nI\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt and accept that he\u2019s just trying to bond with your son over girls and show empathy for his developing urges, but man\u2026 imagine it\u2019s some random dude and not your husband talking about such young kids in that way\u2026 I imagine you\u2019d be creeped out.  He needs to knock it off and you\u2019re not at all the A for telling him so.", "NTA. If your son is attracted to girls, why does he need to normalize it?", "NTA and besides being objectifying, if your son was embarrassed it\u2019s because his dad just tried to talk about his classmates\u2019 boobs. I would have been mortified if my dad ever said anything like that.", "NTA and creepy. Your husband was talking about children's breasts. It was objectifying and completely inappropriate. Besides, you don't want your son to have \"lightness\" about sexuality. You want him to have healthy feelings, but responsible feelings where he will take his personal safety/comfort/consent/health and his partner's safety/comfort/consent/health seriously. You don't want him to be laissez-faire about it. Not only is your husband being creepy, he is irresponsible and doing a disservice to your son. He needs to do better.", "Ugh As a woman with big breasts so many jokes like this when I was a teenage girl, even father. It in no way \"normalizes sexual development.\" But he also completely disregarded genuinely engaging with your son about what happened to make a gross joke about teenager girls. And it pretty clearly didn't result in your son feeling comfortable talking about what happened.  \n\n\nThe bigger issue is your husband's response. He sounds like he's really leaning hard to \" I get to say whatever I want to our son without consequences\" territory.", "NTA\n\nBy the way your husband sounds like he's still in 7th grade.", "These are children not women and you need to explicitly and loudly call out your husband when he makes these comments. You are completely right this is not an appropriate way of thinking, and eventually - acting. As someone who was teased and had things thrown at my etc as a young girl with developing breasts I shudder to think that my bullies were receiving encouragement at home. Your husband is ignorant and disgusting, he should be ashamed of himself. If he doesn\u2019t change get tfo of that household and take your son with you.", "NTA. No grown adult man of his age should even be thinking about a 12 year olds breast. Please check his internet browser history.", "NTA, and your husband isn\u2019t sexualizing or objectifying women. That would still be wrong, but he\u2019s objectifying and sexualizing literal children and using your son as his excuse for why.", "Tbh I find it creepy how your husband is talking about 12 to 13 year old girls. \nNTA", "And I as a man just facepalmed after reading this as husband was so out of line it\u2019s ridiculous. And breast\u2019s=personality is just plain obnoxiously stupid. NTA he was so incredibly out of line", "NTA. That's creepy as hell. He's literally teaching your son to treat breasts as sexual objects.", "NTA.  I would be equally upset.  He\u2019s teaching toxic masculinity (which is NOT as popular anymore and will make your son hated by his peers who are worthwhile) and also teaching your son lessons that could put HIM in danger\u2014i.e., that it\u2019s normal for adults to comment on children\u2019s private parts.  I intend to teach my daughters that comments like these are made by \u201ctricky people,\u201d the modern day equivalent of stranger danger that recognizes that predators are statistically more likely to be familiar to kids.", "NTA - thee is a way to talk to kids about sex and there development and this isn\u2019t it. It seems pretty creepy to me and I would be uncomfortable with my child being talked to that way.", "Ask him if he would be saying the same things to his daughter? Or if he would feel comfortable saying them to his mother or in front of Son's girl classmates parents. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\n\nAsk him if he had a daughter would he find it funny? Would he find it funny if he heard a dad of a boy in his class making this joke about his daughter?", "NTA\n\nIt's not funny, it is objectifying, and kudos to you for putting a stop to it.", "Your adult spouse is talking about 12-year-old children\u2019s bodies in a sexual way. That\u2019s gross. NTA.", "NTA. Women\u2019s bodies should not be the butt of the joke, nobody\u2019s body should be as a matter of fact. Not only is he objectifying the female body, he\u2019s objectifying pre teen girls, not okay.", "NTA. But I would consider spending some time thinking on if you want to be married to someone who thinks it\u2019s funny to objectify and sexualize children.", "NTA. And I applaud you for trying to bring up your son to not objectify women or laugh at cringy locker room \"jokes.\"\n\nSo your husband not only insists on making such jokes, but also demands that you laugh at them so they come off as less cringy?\n\nKudos for not doing that.", "NTA\n\nYour son is a kid.. letting the dad have kind of the free pass of dehumanizing females kind of sets the boundaries of male privilege.. which I feel like if they are wide sets a bad example and kind of forces the son to try to find ways to be a decent human on his own.", "NTA. This is how those creepy men, catcalling in bars, assaulting women etc. are made.", "NTA. I get what your husband was trying to achieve and maybe part of why he thought it was acceptable was because that\u2019s how men/boys joked when he was your son\u2019s age, but that doesn\u2019t make it okay.", "Good on you. NTA", "NTA unless your husband has breasts, he doesn't get to decide what's offensive about them. As for society nowadays, the feeling is mutual. We don't want him apart of it if he can't behave like a rational human being.", "NTA. He's being gross and wrong. He's talking about kids.", "NTA good on you for voicing it!   \nNot wanting your kid to become a douche young adult who'll trash talk women when none is around should be normal.", "NTA, definitely creepy AF that he made this \"joke\" directly about such young girls.", "NTA. Your husband should realize that if you, as a woman, is offended, then it is offensive. What a dick.", "NTA. Not only is he objectifying women, he\u2019s objectifying underage girls. That\u2019s all that needs to be said imo", "NTA but women reading this who date men like this because you think you don't deserve better or think you can change him or sunk costs or whatever... This awaits you.\n\nHow did you choose this man of all men to father your children?", "NTA. Your husband definitely shouldn\u2019t be talking about children\u2019s breasts.", "Oh my god. Disgusting. NTA. This was wrong.", "NTA- that sets him up to act in a certain way in school that could get your son in trouble. Also it's completely gross for a grown man to comment on preteen girls developing breasts.", "NTA women laughing along awkwardly with terrible sexist jokes made by men in positions of power of them is something that happens (less and less these days) in the workplace. It's not something a wife should be pressured to do by her husband.", "NTA. he wasn't even talking about women, he was talking about *children*. honestly, this raises about 500 red flags for me.", "NTA. Objectifying women by encouraging oogling and sexualizing their breasts at age 12 is not developing a healthy sexuality, and it's disturbing that your husband wants to socialize your son into being a jackass.", "NTA. He's making a sexual joke about the bodies of minors. This is NOT ok under any circumstances.", "NTA. I just cringed at that \"joke\" so hard.  Not only was it not funny, but it was outright objectifying. And objectifying 12-year-olds. Jokes like these can really easily lead your child down the wrong path. Your husband either said that girls are only developing personalities at puberty (aka when they begin to look \"sexy\"). Or reducing your son\u00b4s interest in purely physical traits, when he might actually be interested in the person the body is harboring.\n\nBecoming interested in bodies is not wrong, and should be talked about and normalized between parent and child. But OP\u00b4s husband is really not selling the \"its the personality that matters the *most*\"-message that he should be doing.\n\nNo matter how you twist and turn that \"joke\" it doesn\u00b4t sound good. Make sure to shut down jokes like this loud enough for your child to hear. Don\u00b4t let him remember this as an acceptable joke.", "Your husband is the reason rape culture exists and gets passed down. \n\nHe is completely comfortable making you feel lesser when you raised your concern and he disregarded it wholesaledly with no self reflection.\n\nShut this down.\nShut this down HARD.\nReprimand the behaviour loudly.(yes, in front of your child)\nMake sure your son understands how it impacts you. \nMake sure your husband knows how this impacts you. \nDo this EVERY TIME.\n\nYour husband needs to shut the hell up or be removed from your childs life. He doesnt respect you or any of us. His joke is chillingly casual. \n\nDo not let him pass this onto the next generation.\n\nNTA. You are the hero in this story. Your husband is the literal tool of patriarchy which teaches kids its okay to objectify and devalue women. DO NOT STAND FOR IT FOR ONE HECKING SECOND.", "Your husband wasn't \"normalizing\" anything, he made an immature and misogynistic \"joke\" about teenage girls and is trying to backtrack now that he's catching heat for it. He was 100% aware of the the implications behind the joke he was making and now he is trying to use a bunch of buzzwords to make you think he's somehow being progressive. NTA OP,  don't let him off the hook for this.", "NTA your husband is though", "NTA, i'd show him this post to show him he is indeed TA and definitely needs to rethink. This isn't a culture his attitude would be acceptable in and rightly so. He needs to give his creepy misogynistic ass and head a wobble.", "Ewwww, I hope you don\u2019t have daughters. So creepy. NTA", "Jokes are supposed to be funny anyways. NTA", "NTA.\n\nMy 43/f husband 46/m and I have been talking more about things like this with our 11 year old son. \n\nI think it IS very important to discuss things like how we are attracted to people and bodies and body parts, and that all of that is normal. It\u2019s normal to be attracted to breasts, legs, backs, bums, hair, smells, the sound of a voice, etc\u2026\n\nMaking a joke about breasts like that is not how I would want my husband to handle it, and certainly not how I would handle it. \n\nI think it\u2019s great that your husband wants to be involved and have open conversations about these things with you and your son, but he needs to be responsible with his message.", "NTA. I\u2019m actually concerned - why is your husband speaking about MIDDLE SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN in a sexual manner? That creeps me out. When I was 12 developing breasts I just wished the world would stop sexualising me. These girls have as much a right to healthy development as your son and your husband\u2019s attitude strips that away from them. He is sexualising CHILDREN. \n\nMoreover I doubt your son likes this he probably finds it extremely awkward. My dad did the same with my brother and it made both of us extremely uncomfortable. The last thing any child needs for healthy sexual development is their parent enforcing sexuality on them. \n\nYour husband is way out of line and if my partner said something like that about underage girls I would be very concerned. They are not \u201cwomen\u201d, they are \u201cchildren\u201d", "NTA.\n\nYour husband sounds immature. It's not just about objectifying women; it's about acting like a grownup and not making stupid jokes in front of an insecure kid.

I must have missed how degrading and subjugating women is cultural now./s But seriously, NTA but your husband is. Perhaps show him this thread?

I\u2019m sure your husband didn\u2019t mean it that way but that\u2019s likely because back in the day that was normal and it\u2019s probably part of his own foundations of interpersonal relationships with women.

Young girls are disproportionately likely to be victims of them. Teaching your son that when he looks at girls dancing at school, he should be looking at their breasts is not healthy. Women don\u2019t deserve to be sexualized \u2014 GIRLS don\u2019t deserve to be sexualized \u2014 while just existing. We need boys to see girls and women as whole humans.

Guys are often awkward about these things, I feel like hubby is deviating to boob jokes to play it safe. \n\nBecause usually these things start with awkward informational discussions. Like \"hey son, let me tell you about nocturnal penile tumescence and nocturnal emission.\" Or it can be picking up on little things and talking about them calmly without being judgmental or too pushy. We were watching a movie and my nephew mentioned he felt like a girl had too big teeth, we talked some about that, it opened up a chance. Or my niece asking me why customers at work kept asking her if she was 18. Or me occasionally casually mentioning periods around them without making it personal. \n\nOnce that foundation is built, there is room for humour. Earlier this summer I was wearing bright red shorts. They'd been on sale. My niece asked me why I was wearing that colour, so I told the Brown Pants joke.

I laugh at jokes making fun of white people, does that make me a racist? I don't think it does", "nah.  I see why you would say that though.

And then nobody stands up and says that it's not okay to sexualize children like that?Because that's how it goes for girls \"lucky\" enough to grow breasts young.\n\nIt is incredibly dehumanizing and illustrates *exactly* what is wrong with objectification.

Grown men suddenly treated me differently, and I knew exactly why because of where their eyes went and the little snickering comments they made. \n\nSit the fuck down, shut the fuck up, and *listen and learn* because a ton of people in this thread are telling you exactly why this is harmful. Big boobs don't equal personality. He wasn't highlighting the absurdity of misogyny and objectification, FFS. If he was, this post wouldn't exist. He was objectifying children in an attempt to bring his son into the good ol' boys' club by using what has been referred to as \"locker room talk\" and \"just being boys.\" No to all of that. You can relate to your children without sexualizing their peers. If you can't, and then retreat to the lame \"It was just a funny joke! Why are you so mean and sensitive?!\" then there is something wrong.\n\nLittle things like this shape who we become, which is why it is incredibly important for adults to learn how to model proper apologies to their kids when they fuck up.

Why would girls think big books are funny? \n\nYou have to realize that these girls are going through physical changes as well and will be very self conscious.
