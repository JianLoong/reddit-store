Let's call them Bart (M15) and Lisa (F11). My ex-wife married Moe the year after our divorce. We set up a joint custody arrangement where I have the kids for 14 days and she has them for another 14 days. I never had even know Moe beyond being my ex-wife's new husband, but I respect him and I do not interfere in their relationship at all.\n\nUnfortunately Moe died. My ex is devastated now, she seems to really like him and this is a hard time for her.\n\nAll of this happened while the kids were with me. My ex-wife called me to bring the kids to the funeral and I said it would be fine, no problem. I told the kids that and I was surprised when they told me they didn't want to go. Bart even said, \"We're glad he died. I was shocked, he never said that about anybody. Lisa also said she didn't want to go, she just wanted to stay here with me. I asked them many times if they were sure, and they said yes over and over again. So I called my wife and told her that I wouldn't drive them to the funeral, they just didn't want to go. She asked for a moment, then after a minute she started screaming softly (like when you want to scream but don't want people around you to hear) and asked me what I meant and to take them there NOW. I just told her they didn't want to go and I wasn't going to make them do anything against their will. So she started calling our kids, Bart answered his phone, and he just said, \"No, Mom! We don't want to go! Get over it!\" and hung up.\n\nAfter a while I hear a loud bang on my door, I open it and it was my ex-wife, she immediately gets into my house and starts locking around to get Bart and Lisa. My ex asked me where they were and I just told her \"in their room\". She goes right there to knock on their door and tell them to get ready and go to the funeral, the 3 of them have a heated argument through the door. She demanded I open the door with my key. I have a key, but I will not open the door if they do not want to. Then she tries to get into my room, finds my bunch of keys and says \"which one is it\" I get pretty fed up so I tell her to leave or I'll call the police, she yells at me \"I'm their mother, they will come with me\" so I yell back \"I'm their father and we have an agreement, now leave\". She finally leaves, not before saying that she will take me to court for \"parental alienation\".\n\nThe kids leave their room about half an hour later, apologizing for all the trouble. My ex-wife posted a bunch of stories that night about how sad and angry she was because not only did her husband die, but her ex-husband )me) \"alienated\" the kids and didn't even let them say goodbye to their stepfather.\n\nEveryone in the family has seen these stories, and now tell me I'm a heartless, vindictive ex who's using the kids to punish my ex at her worst moment. Maybe I should have driven them to the funeral? This situation is just too much.

Are you still in shock now? Your kids are more important than asking Reddit for judgment. Type less to us and more to your kids, IMO", "Uhhhh that\u2019s well beyond grieving. Grieving doesn\u2019t give you the right to trample other people\u2019s boundaries and the rule of law. I\u2019ve grieved before, I imagine you probably have as well. I never walked the line on B&E during my process.", "Whats your point?\n\nAny caring parent would want to why?\n\nWaste of a comment", "No one\u2019s saying you\u2019re a selfish monster, you were listening and honoring what your kids were telling you - but there is much more to unpack here and you need to start asking the questions.\n\nNot liking the stepdad enough to reject supporting their mother when she\u2019s grieving is a big red flag.", "But it\u2019s your job to? I support you supporting your kids\u2019 wishes but the fact that they\u2019re celebrating their stepfather\u2019s death\u2014and essentially telling their mom to get over it\u2014and you have no idea why should concern you. \n\nWas he abusing them?\n\nIs she abusing them?\n\nDo they simply lack empathy?\n\nYou should be extremely concerned by their responses.", "With all due respect - they were already upset. This was a big choice and saying they were glad he died was a big declaration. It needed a follow up.", "So Stepdad was murdered in a violent attack and you didn\u2019t talk to them at all about their feelings about that? On top of not asking them about why they were glad he was killed? On top of not asking them why they didn\u2019t want to support their mother as she grieves? \n\nYou need to sit with them asap. And therapy might be a good idea.", "I think the poster means share it to the same social media post your ex posted to. I could be wrong though.", "Because they might regret not going.  Because they might want to talk it out even if you don't force them to go.  Because mom.lost her spouse and probably needs them there.  \n\nI am not saying you force them, but dad has to explore why.", "That\u2019s one outcome, sure, but it\u2019s far from the only one and a bit of a reach.  OP didn\u2019t suspect abuse or even think to ask his kids about it.", "Well said. The last sentence hits it right on the nail.", "Bro, they were glad he was dead. Why would a 15 year old boy and a 11 year old girl be happy about that? They didn\u2019t even want to get out of the room whenever their  mom came.", ">But you understand you have to ask that question, right?\n\nYes I know.", "(Stories likely fake but if it is true) I think it makes sense for him not to aggressively push for answers while all of this drama is going on for them. They need a bit of stability right now & he can work with them over time to find out what happened.", "How is walking through an opened door a b&e?\n\nShe's grieving the loss of her husband and the people she loves the most in the world are being assholes, I cannot imagine the emotions she's going through, I would be so devastated", "She's agreeing with you, dude.", "I did ask them about their feelings after my ex wife gave them the news over the phone. Bart said didn't want to talk about it, so I just let him be, Lisa cried a bit but later went back to her normal self after being along with her brother for hours.", "Your right on the bottom part he should explore, but tbh how the hell you react too \u201cI am glad he\u2019s dead\u201d like I wouldn\u2019t know how too.\n\nAnd regret maybe but probably not I mean if both kids are saying they don\u2019t want to go and are glad he\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t there a deeper issue? And the fact they locked their selves in the room when their mom went kinda crazy(I mean don\u2019t blame she lost her spouse)and kept refusing to go out, I don\u2019t see they\u2019ll regret it.", "No it's not. It's not normal behavior 2 kids be \"happy\" someone died. Op doesn't seem like the brightest cryon on the box hence he never picking up his kids hated their stepdad and are frightened of mommy dearest.", "I'm just thinking about the mom. She's going through a tough time and if having her kids thier can help her, they should've done it for her.", "I can understand that but they didn\u2019t even want to support her that says something else. I mean there\u2019s a deeper issue as well here.  Sure it sucks but you can\u2019t force them to go they just might end up,\nresenting their mom for it maybe or maybe not."]}
