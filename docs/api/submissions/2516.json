You were defending your family, she sounds so mean spirited. They must be boring and essentially not worth speaking to because they don\u2019t speak English \u201cwell enough\u201d??That\u2019s some very thinly veiled racism if I\u2019ve ever heard it. Your partner can\u2019t just expect you to repeatedly lie down and take it, especially when it comes to family. It sounds like you were pretty calm about the whole thing too. Good for you, she probably isn\u2019t used to getting any pushback", "NTA. I'm glad he wanted to handle it, but you get to stand up for yourself. When you stand up for yourself, he should be there as back up and reinforcement.", "I love how you said the same thing to her as she said to you but that was suddenly \u2018too far\u2019 for the dad. Honestly I would see red if someone said that about my immigrant parents. \n\nTell your bf to put himself in your place and maybe he will understand why you didn\u2019t call him over to set her straight the way he expected.\n\nNTA", "NTA what she said wasn't just rude it was borderline racist and I find it funny that when you returned the insult that supposedly wasn't a big deal when it was about your parents it was suddenly too far when it was about them. She sounds fun (eye roll)", "NTA. Good for you.", "I'm leaning towards NTA. Sounds like she dished it out, but she couldn't take it.", "NTA and you are my hero :)", "NTA. You have every right to defend your family. Especially from someone who goes around making judgmental comments about children.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s perfectly ok for your partners parents to criticize your parents. But the entire point is that this is supposed to happen out of earshot. If it\u2019s overheard, it\u2019s open season, and the partner whose parents were criticized is definitely allowed to hit back just as hard, if not harder.\n\nTo add: my mother criticize my mother in law all the time. But do she do it in ear shot? Hell no. She knows better.", "NTA. Never stop standing up for yourself and your family. Your partner\u2019s mom sounds like a bigot. Good on your partner for wanting to do something about it, but it should be you defending yourself/family with your partner supporting you in the background.", "NTA. I don't think you needed to have your partner defend you and your parents. She sounds like someone who needs constant pushback or they'll never stop (clearly your partner's past \"setting the record straight\" moment didn't last long).", "NTA!! Sounds like she can dish it out but can\u2019t take it. You pretty much drew a boundary!", "nta", "NTA.\n\nYou just repeated her words back to her. Just keep doing it.

And they get away with it cause no one stops them. Good for you! And the father is a major asshat too!", "NTA \"Hey, that's too far!\"  No, it's really not.
