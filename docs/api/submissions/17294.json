At the time she was diagnosed with terminal cancer my dad was already cheating with his mistress Linda. Linda was a childhood friend of my mom. I found out and my dad and Linda asked me to keep it a secret so that my mom can die in peace. I didn't know what to do so I told my grandmother what happened and she told my mom. They got separated before my mom passed away. My dad married Linda 9 months later.\n\nI'm not at peace for what they did and have not forgiven them. Linda and I constantly clash and we don't get along. Things are not that much better between me and my dad either. I usually spend mothers day with my grandmother but this year my dad insisted that I need to join their celebration with Linda to show respect to our family. I didn't want to go as that's between Linda and her children (she has two from her ex), she's not my mother.\n\nAnyway, my dad did not allow me to go to see my grandmother this year and I wanted to stay home but he didn't let me and forced me to go with them. Linda's parents were there too. I was very frustrated being forced to go. I also don't get along with Linda's children so wasn't keen to spend even more time with them.\n\nThe first thing that didn't go as planned was the food. Linda, her children and parents are all vegan. My dad and I are not. I don't usually mind eating vegan food though. The restaurant was German but quite vegan friendly with half the menu being vegan however I decided to order a Schweinshaxe. My dad told me no as it's disrespectful and reminded me that today is for Linda and her mom who are vegans, we shouldn't bring meat to the table. This is Linda's problem as she believes it's bad manners to eat meat at a \"vegan table\" whatever that means. I said they don't have to eat it and repeated my order to the waitress alongside a black forest ham appetizer. My dad wanted to intervene but Linda's father told my dad to let me get whatever I want so he back down.\n\nWe had food which I can say made Linda and my dad little uncomfortable with me having a lot of meat in front of me. Second thing was my dad's letter for Linda which he read out loud. It was complete bullshit as he said Linda's been a good mother for me which is the joke of the century. When everyone raised a glass for Linda I didn't. My dad asked me why didn't I and if I wanted to say something. I wasn't planning to but he put me in that position so I raised my glass and said happy homewreckers day and said it's very motherly to tell a 10 year old to lie to her dying mother about your affair with her dad.\n\nMy dad shouted enough and told me to get out of here. I said first good thing you said all day and left.\n\nTurned out Linda's parents didn't know about the affair so I've outed them, and now her children are accusing me of ruining mothers day and causing problems in their family.

As the OP pointed out, her mom changed her will and that is a very important thing to consider. So, that\u2019s a fair argument. But I don\u2019t think, she should\u2019ve told the mom just to be vindictive. If the mom didn\u2019t have a meaningful will, I don\u2019t think she should\u2019ve told her.\n\nYes, sometimes the cheater will get a free ride if it means sparing the other person even more pain. So, I just think it\u2019s something that needs to be dealt with very carefully.", "When I made that comment, I hadn\u2019t considered that there was a will. If there were meaningful assets that were changed due to the revelation of his affair, then it would possibly justify telling the mom. But if you\u2019ve ever been cheated on, you know how that would feel. That\u2019s the last thing she would need to take to her grave.\n\nI don\u2019t think telling someone something is always the best thing. Depends on the upside versus the downside. Have there not been a will, I would continue to believe that telling her was wrong thing to do.", "You\u2019re not dying a fool because you trusted someone and they violated the trust. By definition, anyone can be cheated on if they trust the other person.", "How do you think this helps Mom? She\u2019s already dealing with her on grief of losing her life, never seeing her family again and then add the incredible pain and trauma of being cheated on? Is that a helpful thing to take to her grave?\n\nWhat the fuck was Grandma thinking?", "And those are valid reasons for telling the person. As I acknowledge in another comment, I hadn\u2019t considered the possible financial implications of revealing this information to her mom.", "learn to read the voting guide", "Yes it does.", "Sure. But OP is 15 and *in the moment*  they pushed her until she cracked.", "When is the right time? OP wants nothing g to do with these people she'll never see them unless forced for events/holidays, so there will never be a \"right time\"", "> ruined the day for everyone\n\nNo. The parents set the day up to fail, by forcing and expecting OP to participate in their ridiculous play-acting\n\nIn all seriousness: what was OP to do *in the moment*?", "OP is in an impossible situation, and you would suggest not rocking the boat and her staying quietly coerced by her Dad and Linda... wild.\n\nOP did not ruin Linda's kids mothers day, Linda did by cheating and coercing a 10 year old to stay quiet WHILE her mom was dying. What happened yesterday is not coming out of nowhere.", ">My mom changed her will and life insurance beneficiary after this.\n\nOh wow.  This is my own story. My mother was dying of MS. I was about 11. My father started an affair with the neighbour's much younger daughter. My mother wrote him out of her will and left everything to me. My father went nuclear and took it out on me. And I wasn't even the one who told her. Oh and he married the affair partner too, it was a tough few years for me.", "So you would be ok with the money going towards her cheating spouse and mistress and not her child?? Absolutely not.\n\nWith how dad is acting, OP probably never would have seen a dime bc Linda would have spent it.", "Way to miss the point. The mother deserved to know.", "I doubt the ten year old child was thinking about inheritance when she told Grandmother about what her father had done.", "If OP wanted to tell them calmly because for whatever reason they thought it was something they needed to know that would be something different.", "Well I'm here for judgement so I know I might not have acted in the best possible way.\n\nI'm not a liar so I couldn't toast and I didn't and chose to not participate and I'd have done only that if they didn't put me on the spot to say something and I told the truth about my feelings towards her. I couldn't lie and say she's a great mother.", "Why is it *always* on the victim of terrible behavior to suck it up, even when the victim is a literal child?  OP's father and stepmother spent all day pushing and provoking her.  Fuck them.", "Yepp like I said in my comment. OPs dad and stepmom did a bad thing but something thats completely understandable given context. \n\nBut the cheating isnt the issue. Its the treatment of OP thats the issue. They are assholes. Not because of the cheating but because they are crap  selfish parents.", ">  just to be vindictive\n\nyou think that's what it was? I missed that", "but you arent arguing that you are saying the mom shouldnt have been told at all.", "Yeah this is till the wrong way to think just because if they had a will or not. Its about being honest with your loved ones and not letting them being walked all over just cause they are dying.", "are you the dad?? You seem awfully mad that Gmom refused to lie/not tell to her own child that the supposed life-long partner was utterly destroying their trust as she died. It's always better to know when your being cheated on or being cheated with. That is not a good partner and they do not deserve to be in your life no matter how long or short it may be. \n\n  \nAlso this isn't new, men are more likely to cheat/ move-on when their spouse is ill and/or dying than to be an actually partner and support their spouse in times of need.   Will or no will, that's messed up.", "Well then I'd rather have the liar exposed than have them pretending like they were the best husband in the world.", "That her daughter deserved to know the truth of her husband and her friend. \n\nIf this is how you treat your child when they are dying and letting them be cheated on then you suck", "it's not fun but you can't lie. the mum was not a child to be protected from the truth.  as it is, she was able to change her will so that the cheater was not rewarded", ">What the fuck was Grandma thinking?\n\nObviously that she knew her daughter well enough to realise she would want to know the truth.", "ok!", "god you really are trashy and greedy", "No it doesn\u2019t", "Dad forced the situation.  He wanted to present the \"happy family\" knowing full well that his daughter knew about the affair and wanted nothing to do with this family.  He also did not let her spend the day with her grandmother, which she generally does.\n\nAs for dad ..... truth sucks sometimes.  But you play stupid games and win stupid prizes.", "She could calmly explain the situation to Linda's parents and children on any other time, she's had years to do so and didn't. Literally any other time would be better than when she did.", "Good point. They set her up to ruin the day. It's not her fault. I'm changing my judgement.", "Sorry to hear that. It really sucks. I hope things worked out for you.", "Very true, but it's what the person I was responding to had put forward as an argument in favour of telling the mother.", "Sure, in an ideal world that would have been lovely. \n\nBut OP is 15, not 35. And she is hurt and angry. \n\nOP has been treated appallingly and was put on the spot and told to make a fake speech in praise of these awful people. I cannot and will not blame Op for how she handled it.", "That was quite clear to me. Linda does not deserve to be celebrated.\nNTA.", "Don't listen to this troll", "I'm sure most people will say you are in the right cos that's how this sub is. Personally I don't think silently raising a glass is a lie and I don't believe for a second that you have never lied but of course it's your life and maybe this is how you want to handle drama going forward.", "Because dont you know happy family /s", "As I said I don't think they were right. However, we only have OPs version of the story and I'm not sure it is clear that they were provoking her. I think the Dad was trying to engineer a nice event for the Stepmother and that had the understandable side effect of provoking OP but I don't see that it was their intention. The only thing I can see which seems like a deliberate provocation was asking OP to speak after the toast rather than passing over it. \n\nI think why I sometimes differ in my responses to most people is that I don't answer based on who I think was the most wrong but if I think the behaviour of the OP was justified. In this case I didn't think anything had happened at this event that was so egregious as to justify OPs toast. I am sure I have my bias that play into that reading of events and I don't mean to say I think the Stepmother and the Dad acted well - however they aren't the ones asking. If they had been my answer would have been more focussed on their transgressions.", "That was a hypothetical. I\u2019m saying that if she told her when there was no will, then I would question her motives.", "Reviewed the comment if you need to. It has all the information. In a word: no.", "It\u2019s pretty arrogant to say that something is \u201cthe wrong way to think about something.\u201c You\u2019re entitled to your view and I\u2019m entitled to mine. And you have to question someone\u2019s motives when they tell a loved one something that is going to hurt them and it\u2019s not going to do any good. I don\u2019t understand the concept of someone walking all over you when you\u2019re lying on your deathbed.  \n\nAgain, this is if there is no will or other significant ramifications. I believe it would\u2019ve been better to protect her daughter\u2019s feelings and spare her all the pain and trauma, if not for the will.", "And that\u2019s the difference between you and me. Exposing a liar, does no good at this point, unless the wife is in a position to do something about it. It turns out she was, so I would certainly understand why the grandma told her.", "Why is it on OP to behave more decently and more adult than the actual adults who put her in this position? Why are you holding OP to such impossibly high standards? She's 15 and has been betrayed and hurt.", "She's 15, lost her mom at 10, and is likely still grieving  and wasn't able to spend the day the way she normally does, which is with her grandma. She doesn't have to be nice.", "It's not OP's responsibility to tell Linda's parents in some calm cumbaya moment that Linda was a homewrecker.", "Part of what I love about Reddit is getting exposed to new POVs and changing my mind as a result.", "i dont know if your being sarcastic or not", ">  I hope things worked out for you.\n\nOnly when I cut all contact and moved away. Which was tough because once I turned 18 I got no financial support from my father and my new step mother - they kept popping out babies. I had to drop out of college because they wouldn't contribute or even fill in the forms so I could get a loan or a grant. I was homeless as a result. I became an alcoholic. It got a lot worse before it got better. But it did get better.  So.... prepare yourself for a rough ride in which they will do the absolute legal minimium for you. Your grandparents - and perhaps even Linda's parents - are going to be essential if you are going to make it through the next few years. GOOD LUCK.", "If a ten year old child learned about the affair, there was a good chance her mother was also going to find out one way or another before she died.", "I try not to lie and on the occasion that it happens I feel like I've done the wrong thing. It's difficult for me to accept that lying to benefit the people who hurt me is the right thing to do.", ">  I don't think silently raising a glass is a lie\n\nThen you are wrong\n\nThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. This your whole country knows.", "Sounds like you are a cheater as well no one needs to respect you", "> Personally I don't think silently raising a glass is a lie and I don't believe for a second that you have never lied\n\nWhilst I doubt they've never lied, it's entirely plausible someone who was told to lie to their dying parent would have a more hardline approach to it.", "ah.\n\neven so, the mum was not a child to be protected from the truth. My mother went through this exact scenario. Sure she was devastated but to have concealed it would have been terrible.", "grand-mom wasnt being vindictive though? where are you getting that from", "yeah i stand by what i said to you earlier its the wrong way to treat your child. Money or not they deserve to know the truth about their spouse. \n\nyour opinion sucks and im sorry that your butthurt about it but thats on you", "> It turns out she was\n\nExactly my point. She was able to do something about it and that's why I said what I said.", "So what your saying is that you approve of cheating", "Yes I agree and I already said I don't blame her. The biggest AH are the dad and the mistress.", "Thanks for helping me change my mind!", "Dead serious. The guy changed my mind and I've updated my judgement.", "I'm so sorry to hear that. I'll have to prepare for the worst. My mom's side of the family will help me so I hope it never gets that bad for me. I'm really glad things are better for you.", "You were right not to pretend.\n\nThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.", "I know don't care about cheating as much as many people on this sub but I have never cheated myself. \n\nI guess I just think 30-60% of married couples cheat at some point and I'm not convinced 30-60% of people are irredeemable garbage. Cheating is something that happens sometimes and whilst I don't think it's a good thing I also think people do crappy things and if you don't know their whole life you shouldn't be too quick to judge. Especially if you are young and have never had any real pressure's on your relationship - which I think is often the case here.\n\nAnyway I don't really expect you to care what I write or change your opinions in any way but it's a useful exercise for me to clarify my own thought.", "That's a very reasonable point that I hadn't considered.", "They\u2019re an ostrich. Nothing you say will make them want to take their head out of the sand and see reality.", "I am sorry that you have pain in your life that makes you lash out at complete strangers just for having a different opinion.

Good luck.", "And you cant expect people to respect you for cheating and forcing people to accept your AP just because they make you happy your blaming OP for a situation forced on them by their cheating father and AP. \n\nMaybe stop writing these 'exercises\" they dont really work", "oh i know they just seem money hungry", "lol no trauma and way to think so much of yourself that someone would. \n\nI just think your opinion is wrong and called you out your the one crying so much", "lol your the one justifying the cheating here not me", "You made up a scenario where Op's grandmother told her daughter that her husband was cheating \"to be vindictive\". How is that not arguing in bad faith?", "I don't think it's OPs fault I think it's a specific situation where no one acted as well as they could have.
