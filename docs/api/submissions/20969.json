This came after she regressed into her selfish childhood self. The reason I am questioning if I am the asshole or not is because I think she is now very alone and this is another rejection. She doesn't have anyone to cry to now about this really. She has to me but I ignored it. I know doing something like that is pretty serious and is something you can't take back. All in all I feel as though I maybe am being too harsh with her by saying she's no longer welcome at the wedding.

It's understandable that you feel frustrated and overwhelmed by her behaviour, especially when it comes to your wedding, which should be a special and meaningful event for you and your fiance.\r  \n\r  \nWhile your decision to not invite her to your wedding may have been driven by past experiences and concerns about her potential behaviour during the event, it is essential to approach such decisions with empathy and understanding. Completely excluding her from your wedding might be perceived as harsh by some family members, and it could potentially escalate tensions further.\r  \n\r  \nBefore making any final decisions, consider having an open and honest conversation with your sister. Express your concerns and how her behaviour has affected you in the past. Let her know that you value your relationship with her but that certain boundaries need to be respected for both your well-being and the success of the wedding. Encourage her to reflect on her actions and consider the impact they have on others.\r  \n\r  \nIf she shows genuine remorse and willingness to change, you could consider allowing her to attend the wedding, perhaps with clear expectations and boundaries set in place. However, if she remains unwilling to acknowledge her behaviour or continues to be disrespectful, it might be necessary to maintain some distance to protect your own emotional well-being.\r  \n\r  \nIn such situations, it's crucial to involve other family members, close friends, or even professional mediators to help navigate through the complexities and emotions involved. Ultimately, prioritize your own mental and emotional health while trying to find a resolution that best fits your situation.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re wedding, you\u2019re rules. I would just caution against family blowback. It may be hard for your extended family to understand the nuances of the situation. You may look like the bad guy for not inviting her. I understand dropping her as a bridesmaid, but the non-invite feels like a nuclear option. Regardless, good for standing up for yourself.", "NTA but she appears to have a behavioural problem that could be treated, have you had her diagnosed?", "NTA. But you should also lie to her about the location or day of the event.", "NTA. Your parents maybe taught her to be nice, but she didn't listen to that, it seems.", "I\u2019m not sure why you needed to go to the nuclear option and not invite her as a guest even.  That\u2019s a crazy serious move for a family member just because she\u2019s bossy and a know it all.  Seems like you could just stop engaging with her at all regarding your wedding or anything else really but she could still attend your wedding.  I\u2019m sure there are lots of other annoying people on the guest list, people being how they are.  YTA because you are being far more dramatic than necessary, imo.", "NTA.\nI think you have to be vigilant though. Sis might try to do something during the wedding. Seems like the type to create havoc especially when things didn't turn out her way.", "Sister has main character syndrome. And all this is because of their parents' coddling her throught her life.\n\nShe is that same person who decides to wear white or decides to get proposed or even better announces their pregnancy at someone else's wedding. \n\nThese people can't breath a second without drawing the whole room's attention towards them.", "Have to agree with this.", "Had to.

She doesn't listen to what people tell her and she tries to get her own way in everything. Food, clothes (for the wedding), what people should do when she's joining them for a hang out, and you tell her and she doesn't change. I know she's capable of it. She was really good for a while there. But that selfish nature in her is still very present.", "She was told she had zero say but ignored me and my fiance, continued to interject with her own wishes, saying she needed to know what we were planning or dissing what we already had planned. Then she'd whine and make a huge deal about it.

But she has shown she is capable of change and yet reverted back to the way she was as a child which is on her now.", "I have spoken to her clearly on multiple occasions and nothing changed. The fallout with extended family is not a huge deal to me. I'm not especially close to many of them and they are not the ones who believe I am being harsh to my sister. I do not speak to our parents and they were the only people she ever truly had in her corner, though not in a healthy way. The members of my extended family who are telling me I am being cruel or should invite her are people who want nothing to do with her themselves and sort of use me as a shield for their guilt.
