It's understandable that you feel frustrated and overwhelmed by her behaviour, especially when it comes to your wedding, which should be a special and meaningful event for you and your fiance.\r  \n\r  \nWhile your decision to not invite her to your wedding may have been driven by past experiences and concerns about her potential behaviour during the event, it is essential to approach such decisions with empathy and understanding. Completely excluding her from your wedding might be perceived as harsh by some family members, and it could potentially escalate tensions further.\r  \n\r  \nBefore making any final decisions, consider having an open and honest conversation with your sister. Express your concerns and how her behaviour has affected you in the past. Let her know that you value your relationship with her but that certain boundaries need to be respected for both your well-being and the success of the wedding. Encourage her to reflect on her actions and consider the impact they have on others.\r  \n\r  \nIf she shows genuine remorse and willingness to change, you could consider allowing her to attend the wedding, perhaps with clear expectations and boundaries set in place. However, if she remains unwilling to acknowledge her behaviour or continues to be disrespectful, it might be necessary to maintain some distance to protect your own emotional well-being.\r  \n\r  \nIn such situations, it's crucial to involve other family members, close friends, or even professional mediators to help navigate through the complexities and emotions involved. Ultimately, prioritize your own mental and emotional health while trying to find a resolution that best fits your situation.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re wedding, you\u2019re rules.

I ask because I feel like this nightmare will pop up for you again at big moments (weddings, childbirth/pregnancy, funerals) and all that shit is not easy or fun and it might be *easier* if she was in therapy and less of a risk for defaulting to this shit.
