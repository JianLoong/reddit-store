It's understandable that you feel frustrated and overwhelmed by her behaviour, especially when it comes to your wedding, which should be a special and meaningful event for you and your fiance.\r  \n\r  \nWhile your decision to not invite her to your wedding may have been driven by past experiences and concerns about her potential behaviour during the event, it is essential to approach such decisions with empathy and understanding. Completely excluding her from your wedding might be perceived as harsh by some family members, and it could potentially escalate tensions further.\r  \n\r  \nBefore making any final decisions, consider having an open and honest conversation with your sister. Express your concerns and how her behaviour has affected you in the past. Let her know that you value your relationship with her but that certain boundaries need to be respected for both your well-being and the success of the wedding. Encourage her to reflect on her actions and consider the impact they have on others.\r  \n\r  \nIf she shows genuine remorse and willingness to change, you could consider allowing her to attend the wedding, perhaps with clear expectations and boundaries set in place. However, if she remains unwilling to acknowledge her behaviour or continues to be disrespectful, it might be necessary to maintain some distance to protect your own emotional well-being.\r  \n\r  \nIn such situations, it's crucial to involve other family members, close friends, or even professional mediators to help navigate through the complexities and emotions involved.

The way she's behaving is egregious and unacceptable, and you're justified in kicking her out of both the wedding party and the wedding itself, but the latter is the nuclear option. This is well within your rights, I simply hope you've fully thought it through, because it will likely change your relationship forever.", "YTA - You can set boundaries in your relationship instead of letting her walk all over you and then banning her from your wedding.", "ESH. I'm wondering why the little sister has suddenly regressed into her childhood behaviour patterns, and if she might be going through something. Maybe she could use some support, rather than being shunned. Also it feels harsh to cut her like this when it doesn't look like she has she had professional help at any point, just a lot of judgment from people.", "NTA. She corrected herself so she saw the issue and addressed it going back to this behavior was a choice so that\u2019s on her", "NTA it's your day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nat what point do your parents take responsibility for her?", "NTA.", "NTA. You celebrate your wedding the way you want to. Your sister is a spoiled and entitled brat, and your parents made her that way. It\u2019s sad honestly.", "NTA. It is the Wedding of your spouse and yourself, not hers.\n\nIt sounds like your sister might need behaviour-therpay.", "Don't let her back in this is your day", "NTA. Sounds like OPs little sis is in need of an extra strong dose of reality.", "NTA\n\nI would actually say your parents are the biggest asshole as they failed both you and your sister.  Your fine not including her.  It may not work, at least at first, but I\u2019d suggest telling your sister she needs therapy in a diplomatic way.  She won\u2019t get out of this by herself, it\u2019s not your responsibility but would be a good thing to fo", "NTA\n\nHonestly would have cut this person off sooner if I were you. Remember most people don\u2019t ever change", "I feel for whoever she tricks into marrying her....", "NTA at all. Extended family should shut the f... up. It\u00b4s your wedding, it should be a day of celebration for you, not a day of dealing with unnecessary family drama.", "NTA. However, I feel sorry for your sister. She obviously never learned social skills and no one ever bothered to teach her not to be a narcissist. I hope she eventually sees this and seeks therapy.", "NTA. She sounds exhausting", "So the sister has been enough of an asshole since what 6 or 7 years old that she has no friends? Surely there must be something actually wrong with her?", "NTA\n\nIt is not your job or the purpose of your wedding to teach your sister empathy.  She needs to work on herself, probably best started with seeking out professional help.  If she can't be a decent human person, she doesn't get to go to their biggest celebrations. You deserve to have the people around you that celebrate you and your partner's love, not someone who wants to twist your celebration to be about them.", "NTA - yikes, she needs some intensive therapy", "not the AITA", "NTA unfortunately this is all your parents fault and she should not be allowed to attend. The relatives that have an issue with it don't have to attend either.", "NTA. Wow, she needs a reality adjustment. Best of luck with your big day! Congratulations.", "NTA \n\nOf course.\n\nNow about her: could she be autist? Or just an extreme control freak?", "NTA\n\nBut your sister seems off. Like something isn\u2019t right up there", "NTA and what?  Remind sis who's wedding it is.  It is not her's.  As someone mentioned, she has main character syndrome and she is a narcissist!", "NTA. Your parents need to deal with this. They created this mess and they have to fix it. This isn't even entirely her fault - she was raised badly and it's now ruining her life. There is an element of once she grew up, she should have learnt better, but it's hard to undo years of being allowed to act like this because your parents couldn't be arsed to parent you.", "You're NTA. Also, your sister is a narcissist. She has all the classic signs.", "Nta. Go no contact. She has done loose screws.", "does sister have some kind of handicap or special need? sounds like she either gets allowance for a special need or 'tough love'.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s your wedding. You should try talking to your parents if she is gonna continue being a child and not listen. You deserve what you want on your wedding day.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding, not hers.", "NTA it\u2019s taken your sisters appalling behaviour to make you do this. Family should be pointing out she\u2019s brought this on herself", "NTA.\n\nBut your sister seems like she has some mental problems. You or your parents should try and get her psychological help as she might not be able to do it herself (or even think she has a problem).\nI feel like a neurotypical person would learn during all the years of seeing her behavior pushed people away. It seems there's more to it than her just being an asshole.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a real pain in the ass, and I don't blame you or anyone else for avoiding her.\n\nOne day, it'll come back to really bite her in the ass, but by then, it will most likely be too late to rectify. She'll have spent her whole life pushing people away, being a demanding narcissist, and she'll be alone...left with regret and feelings of emptiness. \n\nHopefully she wakes up before it gets that horrible, but she sounds extremely resistant.", "This. NTA.\nI can also relate to OP. When my husband and I got engaged, my sister would say and do things to make everything about her and do whatever she could to take any sort of attention from me. Having dealt with her my entire life of this bs, I set hard boundaries and stuck to them. She wasn\u2019t invited to the dress fitting nor was she in the small wedding party, but she was only invited to the wedding. (My husband had his brothers in his party, I had my brother and cousin.) She threw a big fit, complaining to our mom about every little thing but I didn\u2019t care. It wasn\u2019t her day. I told a close friend of mine and my wedding coordinator to watch for her behavior at the wedding and that I give them permission to kick her out if she acts up. Worked out well for us. I only have limited contact with her now, only concerning our mom who is ill. \n\nOP should do whatever she believes is right for her in this situation. It\u2019s rough in the beginning, and trust me I had a lot of anxiety over setting these boundaries but it has been the best thing and I\u2019m way happier now than I was before.", "I feel like I've read hundreds of the same story with the key words wedding and childbirth. I feel like I can predict the trajectory of the story after one sentence.", "She has never had any kind of therapy.", "They never were. I don't speak to them.", "My parents have always, always spoiled and pampered her. She was the golden child. She was the one who could do no wrong. They encouraged every ounce of selfishness and would pawn her off on me when it got too much for them, under the guise of sibling bonding. They have never been good parents to either of us but to different extremes.", "I have no idea other than the loneliness was finally gone because she had people in her life again.", "She has never been to therapy.", "She wasn't involved in the planning. That's the worst part. She took it upon herself to make these requests/demands.", "I have explained it to her several times. She's had so many chances to go back and correct herself but she doesn't and continues to get worse to the point of almost being like she was as a kid.", "She has not ever been evaluated for autism.", "Se has never been diagnosed or assessed for anything.", "I'm okay with that. There isn't some long standing bond there that makes it hard. We had a shorter period of good than we had bad and I am back to not liking a single thing about her. I'll be better with the relationship over for good and so will the family I am building.", "I do not speak to our parents but they have always encouraged her. No other family care enough about her to do it and I'm not going to put myself through the stress of going beyond what I have already done. She does not listen to me. She changed for a few years and then went right back into her old ways. She could even end up worse than she was as a child. In some ways she already is regarding her ex-roommates.", "\n\n>she obviously doesn\u2019t know any better.\n\nshe's not two, and if she hasn't figured out by now that her behavior isn't acceptable, then that's on her.", "I have tried talking to her many times and pointing out what she does is wrong. She got a second chance when I saw she had improved. Now she has regressed so far back to that point. I am at the point where I no longer like her again and don't have a strong enough bond to allow her to make my life more stressful than it needs to be.", "she was originally reduced to just a guest and still kept up her bullshit.", "it's hardly silly when the 'favorite' is getting blatantly better treatment. it's one thing for parents to have a favorite kid. it's another when you make it so obvious as to the kids themselves figuring it out.", "I didn't let her walk all over me. But she was ignoring my boundaries. I don't have enough of a bond with her to deal with her constantly pushing against those boundaries to get her own way.", "It would be one thing if she was just whining about things. She's actively trying to control and make decisions for other people that are nothing to do with her. I had to deal with that as a kid. I won't as an adult.", ">She is that same person who decides to wear white or decides to get proposed or even better announces their pregnancy at someone else's wedding\n\nNTA - I was going to suggest that you talk with your parents and see if they could control your sister IF you invited her to your wedding. But I think u/Fantastic_Bag4908 is correct, she'll do something inappropriate and try and steal the limelight at your wedding.", "How old is she? I think she needs some professional help to handle this.

Good luck.", "Make sure your vendors have a password or some way to verify they\u2019re talking to you. Had a friends ex cause some turmoil posing as the bride - it got found out, and stuff got corrected before the wedding day.", "Good luck and congrats on your wedding.  Your sister needs help but it is not your responsibility to accommodate her behavior.  Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.  All you can do is give her consequences.", "No she isn\u2019t two.

How can she keep up the bullshit of expressing unwelcome opinions if OP shuts down the conversations about it with her?", "Yep and our parents couldn't hide it. She got so much control over others and they never batted an eyelid. Whereas I never got any of that.

I think OP is making drama and an unnecessary situation rather than just handling it directly but that\u2019s her call to make.
