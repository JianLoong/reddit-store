Not only have you behaved like a greedy hypocrite, you also violated the second formulation of the categorical imperative.

They want to live luxuriously from your dads money, you all should sit down as a famiand gave a talk with him.", "NTA, just because your dad promised it doesn\u2019t mean it is your responsibility to give it", "OP is vague about most of the details,I would say NTA,but he might have omitted a crucial detail or two..", "I'm not sure if its the same but you could see if you could legally get them to stop. Like its catfishing someone. Depending on how old your dad is it could be called predatory.", "YTA.\n\nif i was your dad i'd be hurt and pissed off too, learning my child thinks so little of my judgement and has so little respect for my right to make my own financial choices. \n\nyou said your dad is only 52, and it seems he's perfectly of sound mind and body and you are not his guardian or caretaker -- you have no right to control how he spends or shares his money.  \n\nand it is his money and his choice. it's a shared account, but he gave you a heads up about money moving out of it temporarily and made it clear he will be replacing that money, presumably ASAP. nothing you've said here makes it seem like he isn't reliable to replace that money quickly, or that he doesn't have enough cash in his current accounts in Country B to cover it, only that he wanted this transfer done quickly and smoothly.\n\neven if what's in that shared account is implicitly earmarked for something else, if it is \\*his\\* investment and earnings, it's still his to spend. and given that he's replacing it before it could feasibly be needed for anything else, he's not even actually spending the joint account funds, just briefly shuffling things around to make things quicker easier for himself.\n\nit sounds like you have a lot of disdain for your extended family (\"leeches\"? really?), so you're taking this excuse/opportunity to try and force your dad into doing what \\*you\\* want him to do with his money instead of respecting his right to make his own financial decisions. that's no less entitled than how your extended family treats him.\n\ngenuinely, what do you hope to accomplish here, OP? you have the right to disagree with his choices, but if he's going to give them money anyway, all you've done is made his life more difficult and showed that you look down on not only his family but also him. why shouldn't he be upset about that?", "NTA. I see that this joint account is set up because you own a property along with your dad and that it\u2019s not supposed to be used for whatever. I\u2019m not sure what the 500k is equivalent to in USD or euros, but he shouldn\u2019t have tried taking the money from the joint account without ASKING you, and then getting your response. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was a relatively small amount of money or if he\u2019s borrowed money before and always paid it back. It sounds like those relatives need to scale back this wedding. I\u2019d also be wary from here on out about being in business with your dad. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s otherwise a great guy, but what happens the next time these relatives ask for money? And the next time? Sounds like there could be a possibility that he just doesn\u2019t tell you until it\u2019s too late. If he\u2019s tired of these people leeching off him, he needs to set boundaries and stick to them.", "Well, but is the 500K USD? \n\nI\u2019m more concerned about the *1,200 guests.* WTAF??", "1. it's not the son's money. it's an account for a joint rental property and OP is pretty coy about who initially bought the property, but in the process is implying that it was at least initially the dad's investment. also seems the dad is perfectly capable of replacing the funds asap via international transfer from his accounts in his current country (Country B), this was just to speed up the process of getting the cash to his family in the meantime. so OP saves nothing and accomplishes nothing except making his dad's life harder by blocking this transfer.\n2. the dad is 52, not 92. he's got the right to choose how he spends or shares his money, even if his kid (or others) disagree with his choices. it's shitty that he feels obligated to share in this way, but still not the son's right to literally control his financial decisions.", "Also transfer out your money from the \"joint account\". Also what else is this account used for you don't know about?", "My son and I have a joint account because of my heath. If something happen to me he can take care of my bills.", "I never thought I'd be thanking someone for making grammatical errors, but here we are. Thank you for the chuckle.", "51yo here. I've been telling people to get off my lawn for over a year. It's fun, mostly when saying it out of context, like in a store, lol.", "Doesn't have to be a joint account. Just get one in the same bank and you can transfer money between accounts. My phone is on my son's account.  I do an online transfer money from my account at the bank to his account at the bank. No joint account needed.", "He has the money in the bank he has in his country, just not in the country where his family is. He will be transferring from his Country B account to the Country A account, but it will take longer.", "literally this!! people are missing this because of how OP worded things.\n\nthe issue isn't \"dad is taking my money for his entitled family\"\n\nthe issue is \"i don't respect my dad's family so i made it harder for him to send his money to them\"", "Honestly? Because I can't ignore a notification. And as long as people keep replying to me I get reminded how OP is pretending to be the victim when he's the asshole", "i'm a bit \"invested\" too, despite being a westerner who has never once borrowed money off family, because it's frustrating when every top-voted comment misses the whole damn point.\n\nOP has made it pretty clear the dad is perfectly good for the money and that it'll be back in the account ASAP, he just blocked his dad's transfer to inconvenience him and basically show everyone up. now he's seeking validation from reddit, probably because he realized he overstepped and everyone in the situation irl is upset with him, and reddit is more than happy to give it to him. sometimes that's annoying af to see happen, that's all.", "seems like OP was born in Country B and lives in Country C, both of which are likely western, and has that cultural individualism shaping his perspective. that doesn't mean the extended family is right for their continuous financial requests or that OP is wrong for not wanting his father to get taken advantage of (in his perspective), but it seems he really doesn't understand the social obligations or family network and dynamics in which his father is embedded in Country A. not good or bad or right or wrong, just an observation. \n\nbut i don't think OP is deliberately exploiting reddit's western lens, it seems like he's just going to the place/medium that \\*he\\* is most comfortable because it's \\*his\\* dominant cultural identity. \n\nanyway in the context of the question he's TA for blocking the transfer because it's his father's money and his father gave him a heads up and will replace the cash ASAP by the sounds of it, and is reliable and good for that money, and ultimately the son needs to respect his father's autonomous financial decisions when it comes to his family, even if he doesn't necessarily understand or agree with those decisions. it sounds like he just used this as an opportunity/excuse to exert his own influence over how his dad shares his money.", "YTA it\u2019s pretty obvious that the joint account is your fathers investment property, you stopped him from taking money from that account despite clearly not contributing to the investment property.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like he did anything wrong, broke any laws.  Rental income in what sounds like a normal personal account for repairs, doesn\u2019t mean that it has to be used for that.  Nowhere have you expressed worry about him being able to afford this, just that you think he\u2019s being soft/taken advantage of. \n\nYou tied up money and created extra fees because you disagree with how your father spends his money.  Are you afraid he\u2019ll spend money that you think should be yours?", "The issue is: whose money was it? If it was the father's, then OP is TA because they had no right to stop their father doing whatever he liked with his own money.\n\nIf it was OP's money, then N T A. If it was joint, a conversation should have happened first. \n\nOP has been high-handed in making decisions for their father. I don't care why.", "If he was planning to give them HIS money, you have no control.  If he was planning to give them some of YOUR money, then you have cause to stop the transfer.", "NTA. great aunt can go complain to a tree. And daddy unfortunately kow tows to the 'sacred family' idiocy", "Based on information in your comments, I say NTA. Your extended family stole from your grandparents to the degree that two of your uncles died from lack of food and your dad was only able to leave with help from your mother's family. Your dad's family is now leeching and wants a good chunk of money for a distant relative to have a wedding. \n\nI think you need to sit your dad down and have a conversation about this entire system. I understand he would lose face but he doesn't live there anymore. How often does he even see these people? What are the actual consequences for him or you if he stops being their provider? Because it doesn't seem like anything happened to them for stealing and neglect. \n\nI'm not opposed to a system that rises entire families but they didn't do their part in this system. So saying no you can't take money out of our emergency account for our jointly owned property to give to these people is not necessary unreasonable.

OP lives in country C but still shares bank account with parents in country B?  Who earned this money? Are there siblings to OP who also share banking and mix their incomes?  I agree supporting extended relatives should absolutely stop, but if it\u2019s dad\u201ds money he can do what he wants with it.  If it\u2019s pooled money all contributors should have a say.  It all sounds so needlessly complicated and confusing but paying for an exorbitant wedding for the grandchild of an aunt is absurd.  OP, you should separate yourself financially from your parents.

Tell them all it's time they started paying for things themselves!", "NTA for keeping your money, YTA for not telling dad. You should have told dad from the beginning you didn't feel comfortable giving them that money and you would not be participating in that. Instead you went behind dad's back.

Assuming that it is his money (I'm kind of TL:DR on that point) then it's important to note that it's not just being thrown in a hole but he's actually getting something for it: major status as the extended family's provider. Now, whether that's worth it is another question, but I'm saying that it's a little more nuanced than the great aunt simply being some grifter.", "It's crazy how the people here don't care that OP destroyed his dads reputation with his own family.
