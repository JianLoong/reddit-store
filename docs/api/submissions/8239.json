Either you two ever live in it?", "Hopefully no one has one with you, if you think joint means only one person can do what they want.", "Maybe they are inviting their entire town/village?", "Did you contribute any funds towards buying the property?", "> he sent me a message to say he would be taking it out of our joint account and he would replace the money.\n\nAre you concerned he won't pay the money back or it won't be in a timely manner (like years)?", "OP does not suggest anywhere that Dad would not actually replace the funds, though.\n\nDad is using the funds from the joint account because it is located in the same country as the family, Country A.  Seemingly, Dad has enough funds in Country B to replace this money in the Country A account.  It just takes more time for money to transfer between countries.  Thus why he wanted to pay his family from an account in Country A.\n\nIf Dad wants to give money to the family, he will still do so.  It will just take longer and be more of a hassle.  If that is how OP wants to play this, that's up to them.  But it is not surprising that the only reaction they got was anger.", "It seems to me that most of the \u201cnta\u201d comments come from us-centric povs, which do not take into account the father at all. OP themself does not see country A as theirs, but B, which is fair since they grew up there. However, the father and the family seems to consider country A as home for OP too, the issue stems from there and they should discuss it.", "Dad does have enough money in Country B.  He just did not have enough funds in the Country A bank account.  He said he would replenish the funds in the Country A bank account.\n\nThis is mainly just an issue of processing times.  Dad could have sent them the money directly from his Country B account, but it could take a while for the funds to be available, due to the different countries.  Given that OP and Dad had no immediate need for the funds in their joint Country A account, it's not as though it harmed OP for those funds to be briefly gone, before being replaced.\n\nOP certainly is within his rights to block the transfer.  But ultimately, all he is doing is making things slower and more cumbersome for his dad and relatives.  If dad still wants to send money to his relatives, he will do so from his Country B account.  Which, fine.  But I don't see why OP is surprised that petty \"I can't stop you, but I can make it a hassle\" moves while his dad is sleeping would result in anything other than a pissed off family....", "NTA - if the money is coming from a joint account, it should be a joint decision.", "You should change bank account asap.

I think you need your own.", "How does he have access to your account?", "While OP has access to the account the post doesn't say anywhere that it's their money in the account in any way. In fact based off the post stating that dad basically supports everyone it sounds very much like OP is also living off of dads money and just doesn't want to have to share.", "In another comment OP stated it was rent collected from a joint owned investment property in Country A, where the funds are meant to be used for building maintenance and for travel funds if an emergency happens in Country A and they need to fly back. So OP had every right to reject sending money for something not related to the purpose of the account.", "OP didn't say where the joint account is located. They only said that dad's *individual* account that doesn't have enough money for what he promised is in Country A. We don't know if the joint account is in Country A (where dad's account & relatives are), Country B (where dad currently is), or Country C (where OP is). Although it's not stated in the OP, I'm guessing they do contribute to the joint account, hence why they're so angry that dad made a unilateral decision to give away the money to the ~~leaches~~  relatives.\n\nEdit: OP said the joint account is income from a jointly owned rental property & the account is to cover costs of maintenance/ repairs/ etc. Dad was wanting to take out more than half of what was in the joint account and had messaged OP while they were asleep, giving them no opportunity to discuss it first.", "Yeah I'm not belittling the amount of money, just wanted to clarify for anyone thinking it was $500k USD.", "But- and this is not in the OPs remarks, it is in comments-\n\nThis account is the proceeds from a SHARED investment (the money is equally the OPs then), and is itended for the upkeep and maintenance and travel service that investment property in an emergency.  SO using it to respond to emotional blackmail is putting the shared investment at risk. I think in full context, OP was right to do what he did.", "Looks that way, If it was a proper business account doing this would likely not even be legal.", "How is this even relevant? The only relevant bit was that they both contribute to a joint account.", "Neighborhood Wedding\u2122", "This is what I was thinking as well - that it really boils down to whose money it is.  \n\n\nOP has indicated in a few comments that it seems to be a *truly* shared account (both have contributed equally and both have equal ownership) and so I think it would make sense for them to treat it just like many spouses treat a joint account. They should make a maximum amount you can withdraw without questions and then both people need to agree to any expenditures over that.  \n\n\nPresumably the wedding costs more than any limit they would have agreed to, so I'm ruling that OP is NTA but with the caveat that they need to have a real heart to heart with their dad about management of that joint account going forward. (Or possibly they give up on joint ownership of the property if no agreement can be reached.)", "The tennants, OP gave further info in the comments that the money comes from renting a property that they and the father share ownership of.", "Literally everyone is headed that way, and will someday be dependent on others. Almost makes you want to build a kinder world that anyone can thrive in.", "\nNTA since it is your joint account, you should have a say?", "It is money from proceeds of a shared investment property, intended for maintenance and upkeep of that property.  Dad using this to respond to emotional blackmail was inappropriate, and puts the investment at risk.", "It\u2019s literally an average Indian wedding xD", "OP also mentioned that joint account is supposed to be for repairs and upkeep of the property and to cover funds if either of them needs to travel to that property.", "Maybe you two should have half go into one account and half into another. Sounds risky!", "Yup that's why I thought having a maximum amount that could be spent with no questions asked is a good idea. No reason to wait several hours for someone in another time zone to wake up so you can ask if it's cool to call a plumber."]}
