You need to revoke his access and let him come up with the money himself. Ignore the great aunt and the other flying monkeys.", "NTA since it is your joint account, you should have a say with what money comes out.

Cut that in half and maybe they wouldn\u2019t have to leech off your family. But also they have no right ask for money and your dad has no right to take money from your account without your approval.", "NTA. Your dad is and so are your relatives.\n\nWhy would your dad even agree to this and start the transfer behind your back?", "NTA, since you have a joint account you got an equal say in this matter. And if you can't get ahold of you father before he makes the transaction the right course of action is to block any transfers and then have a talk about how to go about this.\n\n1200 guests sounds way too much to be honest, they just have to reduce the amount of guests and not have +2 on every close relative invited...", "I'm used to both parties having unfettered access to the funds in a joint bank account, where one of the account holder would not be able to block the other account holders access to the funds in the account. (Different countries, different laws.)\n\nINFO - Did the funds in the joint account come from your dad or from you?", "NTA they shouldn't be spending money they don't have and need to adjust their expectations.

It has to start somewhere.", "Nta. He tried to take over half of what is in the account. He cant just take your half of the money. The lavish events your extended family want to throw is not your problem. If your dad wants to make it his problem then thats on him but he cant force you to participate. Personal opinion, id be looking at a legal way to prevent him from taking the portion of the money your are legally entitled to, just to prevent this type of thing in the future.", "NTA it blows my mind how some people will ask for that absurd amount of money let alone spend it on one damn party. I'm not sure about the joint account that you and your Dad have but I'd suggest taking your share of that money out and keeping it in your own account from now on. He was about to take out it once he could try to take it out again.", "NTA and get rid of the shared account asap", "NTA at all. Many people have extended family like this that view them as cash cows. Your dad doesn\u2019t know how to say no and it\u2019s frustrating. You need to protect your own assets even if he will not. Not sure why you have a joint account unless it\u2019s to monitor his spending. If not, I would definitely keep separate finances. These people will never stop extending their hand as long as the money keeps coming.", "NTA your dad doesn\u2019t get to give away money that is not not entirely his replacing it or not without asking, not just telling, if that makes sense..I would tell everyone that would listen that your aunt is a leech and trying to take food out of your mouth for a wedding she can\u2019t afford. I love going tit for tat with ignorant people.", "NTA. Stand your ground on this.", "NTA. It's your money too you have a saying in what is done with it.

You say this is a joint account, so it sounds like your dad has the right to do whatever he wants with it.  I'm not sure how you can block a signer on the account from generating a transfer.

If you have issues with his spending, talk to him about it.", "YTA:  I get why you did it. But you're treating your dad like a child and telling him what he can do with his money.  I agree he shouldn't give them money, but that's neither mine or your decision.  \n\nIt will be one thing if you told him you don't want him spending your money. It's another to completely block the account.", "Info: it's a joint account but who contributes more?", "NTA. I am the same with my mom. I can\u2019t block like that but I totally get where you coming from. Parents like that are given children like us for protection", "I think YTA, not a big one though. When people from poorer countries migrate it\u2019s usually a family effort to help those people get there. Sometimes the extended family (I don\u2019t know how far extended the family you are referring to is) expect to receive help when the family that left becomes successful in a better country. \n\nI would and I am helping my extended family with money when they need it (i am not to judge what their priorities are whether it is to buy a house, a wedding, a baptism whatever). I understand that I wouldn\u2019t have gone to university or got the life that I have now without help from my extended family that gave money to my mother or helped in other ways (like babysitting, cooking, taking care of me etc) while I was growing up. \n\nYou might not remember all those things but yeah, your behaviour was a bit too much. Maybe talk with them yourself, tell them that you are not as well off as they seem to think, or if it bothers you that much just tell them not to expect anything from you. \n\nYour dad might feel indebted to them, even if he complains about them. He might not want to tell you this. \n\nFrom what you have said your culture seems very similar to mine, you might not feel attached to your family in country A but they very much consider you close to them.", "We jointly own a property in his home country and the rent goes into that account.

Rental income from a jointly owned property goes into the account. There is enough technically to cover it but that would take up maybe 70% of what\u2019s in the account", "Seriously.

What he can\u2019t do is try to begin a transaction from our joint money while I\u2019m asleep to give to some rando second cousin for a frankly stupidly big wedding", "How have you concluded that OPs father had enough money in the joint account to make this transfer without dipping into OP's portion? OP doesn't elaborate on the exact split of the funds or their source, but OPs dad promising to replace the money seems to suggest that at least some funds coming from OP would be necessary to get to the number dad's aunt wants.", "In the nicest way possible, I get where you are coming from but that\u2019s not the case here. \n\nNot a single person in my dad\u2019s family lifted a finger to help him, his siblings, or my paternal grandparents. They actually stole from my grandparents and it meant that my dad\u2019s family literally did not have food to eat. Two of my uncles died from malnutrition and when they (extended family) were living quite happily they literally would turn my grandmother away at their door.\n\nThe entire help to my dad and his immediate family came from my mum and my maternal grandfather. \n\nAs soon as my dad\u2019s relatives saw his star was on the rise suddenly they all had financial emergencies that only he could solve\n\nI am more than happy to help my actual aunt and uncles but im not prepared to give any of my money to some random second cousin so they can entertain 1200 people", "So it's a rent/emergency fund. And definitely not for a wedding. \n\nETA: rental income. I get it. Might need to make a big decision there to wash your hands of this nonsense.\n\nSince you jointly own the property, I assume you both contribute to the account, which means it could negatively affect you if he cleaned it out. \n\nI still believe you should stand your ground on this, otherwise it'll set a dangerous precedent that you will continue to allow this to happen. I highly doubt it'll end at the wedding. What about kids, buying a house etc?\n\nThey'll bleed you dry.

If that\u2019s the case, your definitely NTA. He doesn\u2019t get to take your money and spend in on something that you don\u2019t agree with. If it\u2019s just his money, then he can whatever he wants with it.", "It sounds like you are dodging. Is dad spending his money or is he spending your money. i.e. is the amount he is sending more or less than half the balance in the joint account.\n\nYWBTA if you are taking control of your dad's money, even though he is spending it foolishly.", "Who puts money into that account?", "Never concluded that. My main concern is OP doing this without a conversation first.  Like OP said they did when their dad was asleep.  My opinion the non asshole way to do this is to pick up the phone and have conversation.", "Neah, second cousins can just f off then. When I\u2019m thinking about extended family i think not farther than aunts/uncles and first cousins. All the others are more like acquaintances. \n\nI still think you were wrong in calling the bank, just speak with your father, if it\u2019s a joint account it\u2019s not just your money and you kind of treated him like a child with this one.", "I mean, if he's of sound mind it's really not up to OP to \"protect him\". Especially if it's his money mostly in that account. \n\nI have a family member who complains up a storm about sending money to the rest of the family but does it every time they are asked. Found out it's because it makes her feel useful. She can't help in many ways (distance) so she feels good when she can help financially.", "Lol sorry not trying to dodge. It would be more than 1/2 but less than 3/4", "OP has clarified in the comments that his dad initiated the transfer without discussing it with him and instead texted OP in the middle of the night (due to time zone differences). OP didn\u2019t have an opportunity to weigh in on the conversation before the transfer was initiated, so immediately upon seeing the message, contacted the bank to stop the transfer.\n\nI agree with your conclusion that financial decisions on joint funds need to be made with conversation, but that makes the dad an AH, not OP.\n\nNTA", "Exactly, OP chose to call the bank and not the father. Also the point of a joint account is that both parties can use the entire sum in it.", "She said in another comment that her father didn't speak directly to her, but messaged her when she was sleeping. There was no previous discussion, so stopping the transfer was the only option.", "The mechanical limitations of a joint account are not the only thing that could bind one of the joint account holders from taking an otherwise possible action. Private agreement between those account holders as to what actions may be taken, by whom, and when are commonplace.", "Dad trusted OP. A joint account can be (and should be) fully used by both parties. Dad decided to help his family, he just let OP know his intention to use the money in the joint account, he was probably not asking for permission. \nThe dad should\u2019ve talked to OP about his usage of the account so he too is in the wrong. \n\nOP just acted out in anger and unintentionally humiliated their dad. That is definitely not ok. OP should have called the father not the bank if they were this bothered by the other person using a joint account.\n\nI think everyone is in this case."]}
