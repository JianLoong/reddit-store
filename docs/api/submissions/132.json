{"id": 132, "submission_id": "yiunn7", "title": "AITA for calling out my Dad for hitting the dog on the snout", "selftext": "So today I was at my parents with my partner and our son and they just got a new puppie who's about 8 months old and she's very excited and rambunctious. She loves to lick my sons face and chase him around on the floor but my dad wasn't to happy about it and was constantly commanding her away and directing her away from him. \n\nShe was persistently annoying my dad and my dad got really frustrated and yelled at her whilst grabbing her by the collar and giving her a few smacks in the face, she really was riled up so she was ferociously trying to escape and ended up sprinting away with her tail between her legs. My dad was really mad at this point and continued yelling at her spewing commands uselessly. Then he picks her up and smacks her in the nose about 4 times and puts her In the backyard.\n\nInstantly, I was furious at my dad for displaying this behavior in front of my partner and son (not to say I wouldn\u2019t be furious any other time). Aswell as his blatant lack of understanding of how to correct a dog's behavior, I called him out immediately and asked \"is that how we treat our pets?\" He was still fuming from the dog and responded to me in defense of himself and says I don't know anything about how to train a dog. Then I go on to say that this is what you call abuse and will only instill fear and more misbehaving. Same as a child. And he pointed at our other older dog as a point of reference to his superior training abilities of \"just a smack on the snout\". I stood my ground and told him off infront of my family, he was not happy and walked out, leaving a very awkward moment for everyone.\n\nAt the time I was very upset and anxious about what I just did and was upset at my mom and brother for not speaking up sooner or being upset with this shit. So I asked why nobody else spoke up and my brother walked out and mom said \"there's a time and a place\". Confused, I told my mom that I'm not the one in the wrong and my dad needs to understand that this isn't acceptable. Still nobody is on my side other than my partner and I feel very outcasted by my parents. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1667265109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiunn7/aita_for_calling_out_my_dad_for_hitting_the_dog/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I think people who think you're just calling him out because it was in front of your partner and kid don't get that the fact he did it in front of your kid, only meant you had to act immediately (if I'm reading this correctly). When a child sees a behaviour they learn, you had to act then and there to set precedent for your child. Had they not been there I hope you would have acted anyway, but you might have had the choice to tell him in private, if you think he'd be more receptiveand less defensive that way. But your son was right there, you had to act for the dog's good, and it had to be immediate for your sons good. Good job!", "NTA. That\u2019s animal abuse and also isn\u2019t effective for training a puppy.", "The time and place is then and there. NTA", "The time and place to stop someone from hurting a dog is RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW. Thank you for setting an example for your son that hitting animals is intolerable. Your family needs to learn how to train dogs as these methods are not training and harm the pet. NTA.", "NTA. Your father is clueless on how to humanely and effectively train a dog and is using a very old-school technique. Proper training involves an investment of patience,  time and consistent behavior - and usually involves training the pet owner first. Good for you for calling him out and showing your child it's not okay to abuse a pet.", "NTA. He thinks you don\u2019t know anything about training dogs after he just abused a puppy?!? Has your dad always been an AH? And, your mother and brother enablers?", "NTA\n\n> my dad got really frustrated and yelled at her whilst grabbing her by the collar and giving her a few smacks in the face, she really was riled up so she was ferociously trying to escape and ended up sprinting away with her tail between her legs.\n\nThis is \"I'm really frustrated with you and making a bad decision in the moment\"\n\n> My dad was really mad at this point and continued yelling at her spewing commands uselessly. Then he picks her up and smacks her in the nose about 4 times and puts her In the backyard.\n\nThis is I'm an abusive jerk.", "ESH.  Your dad sucks for hitting a literal baby dog.  \n\nYou suck cause apparently you think this is OK if your kid and partner arent around.  Look at how you worded it.\n\n>  I was furious at my dad for displaying this behavior in front of my partner and son", "ESH. This\u2019ll be downvoted into oblivion. I agree that this is ineffective dog training, but I will abstain as far as abuse because I didn\u2019t personally view the incident. ESH verdict because this is an equally ineffective way to advocate on behalf of the dog. If you just match Dads energy, you\u2019ve proven nothing and can expect no different result. The play here would\u2019ve been to show that you can calm and redirect the dog without physicality. The way you went about it appears to me to be a show of moral superiority to his physical.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As you can see I explained why it's abuse. But I've never witnessed him doing this before so I was just furious that he's so ignorant to his abuse that he will do it infront of his grandson and daughter in law. I would be just as furious any other time, but the fact that he thinks this is a \"teachable\" family moment is really concerning to me.", "I don't know anything about training a dog so I can't actually correct the behavior on my own.
