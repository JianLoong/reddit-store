If he comes through and actually gives the gift I wonder then what sort of gratitude he'd show.\n\nNAH just people being people", "This is a tough one. On one hand I totally understand the reasons behind Drake\u2019s reticence to trust but on the other hand Michael isn\u2019t wrong. He didn\u2019t say something to Drake, he said it to you. And honestly it\u2019s been 5 years that he\u2019s been in your care. Part of parenting is preparing him for the word and I\u2019m concerned that in 5 years he hasn\u2019t been provided with the tools to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to someone he knows doing something nice for him in the safety of his home with you around. His trauma is valid but he also has to move in the world in a way that isn\u2019t going to unfairly impact on him and part of that means being given the ability to interact with basic expected social norms. NAH, perhaps", "INFO: Are you going to use this as a teaching moment for your kid to follow up with a thank you letter or some other way to show appreciation? It IS rude not to say thank you, and you were right to explain to your brother the reason why your son is unable to express that common sentiment at this time.", "He also expects Drake to know social responses such as thanking someone for a gift. That's on you.", "NAH.  I think Michael underestimated the depth of Drake's reserve.  I also think *you* underestimate the amount of trouble Drake will eventually get into if he isn't taught these social graces.  Michael will forgive him; some future stranger or co-worker will not.", "ESH\n\nDrake needs to learn to say \"thanks\" instead of \"ok\" before running off to his room. It's a very very very small adjustment he should be expected to make. It's a basic level of politeness for a child. It has nothing to do with trust.\n\nYou're enabling it and not teaching him basic manners.\n\nYour brother should have handled it better not taken it so personally, but he's right, the proper response would have been \"I'm working on it\" rather than \"that's just how he is\", because how he is upsets people and has to change. There's no one else that can change it other than you.", "Nah. However, your son\u2019s therapist needs to work with him to start modeling appropriate behavior. Yes he has had trauma, and that is not his fault. However how he overcomes it is his responsibility. Given he is in a stable and secure place, and has been for years, now is the time to work on social expectations. This will allow him to have the best chance for success in life.", "NAH\n\nBut Reddit is going to be a tough audience for something like this. You need opinions (and healthy advice) from people who are trauma informed, and that\u2019s a big ask from the general public. \n\nAre you working with a therapist who specializes in traumatic adoptions? There\u2019s a lot of amazing ones out there and the really good ones will make themselves available to you to help you navigate situations just like this! \n\nBest of luck on his healing journey!", "Nah. I don't think some people here actually understand how severely a child can be affected by abuse at such a young age. It can lead to, not just mental health issues, but straight up brain damage if it's severe enough. 3 of my siblings are adopted and they all have long term severe mental health issues and the doctors believe one of them has straight up brain damage. For the first several years they were with us we were just trying to get them to not beat the shit out of eachother every time they had a conflict.\n\nNow it's not unreasonable to expect a child to say thank you for a gift.  So I think that is something you should work on with him,  but I also don't expect it to happen just like that and I'm not gonna blame you for taking so long to work on this. As I said some children take a lot of work just to get them to not respond violently to normal situations never mind their manners.  I strongly suspect you spent the last 5 years just trying to get him to act like a calm rational being and put standard manners aside just to make sure he can respond to normal situations in non volatile ways. That's okay,  but don't think your brother is an ass for wanting a thank you. \n\nPerhaps you should talk to your brother. Remind him of what the kid used to be like and how many issues he still has and remind him that trama responses can take decades to disappear and what that was, was a trama response. And when all is said and done make a thank you card with the kid. I think that would be a solid way to wrap it up and make everyone happy. Make it a home made card too people love that shit.", "This is a hard scenario to make judgment upon as a parent with a an adopted child.\n\nNo child is easy and any adopted child with a past I\u2019d never one size fits all. This is a teachable moment, eventually he will need to incorporate manners in conversations and that will help him grow. Your brother did something very nice for him but it\u2019s not always realistic to get upset if a child doesn\u2019t respond EXACTLY as you hoped for the gift. If he went to the park and was miserable or rude then okay, but not saying immediate thank you isn\u2019t going to ruin the experience intended.", "NAH. \n\nYour kid didn't show the appropriate level of thanks for the gift he's being given. He was rude. So your bro isn't an AH for feeling upset about that. \n\nBUT. \n\nYou have explained very well why your kid was rude, and he's so young, so he's not an AH even though he was rude. Your explanation doesn't mean that he was actually secretly not being rude, it just means it's understandable and natural consequence of things out of everyone's control. \n\nAnd you're not being an AH either, you're prioritizing what you have to to help your kid. Eventually, showing your kid how to figure out who's trustworthy and how to show gratitude to people who do nice things for him is going to be important, but maybe not right now this very instant. \n\nNobody is being an AH.", "NAH:  But truthfully, I'm on your brother's side. If he was younger, like 5 I understand.  But the kid is 11, he shouldn't have to trust someone to be polite to them and say thank you.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nI understand why Drake reacted the way he did. His past experiences explain the behavior, but that doesn\u2019t mean they justify it. Even if he was not really intending to be, he was rude.\n\nIt\u2019s your job as his parent to teach him socially acceptable behavior and good manners. Say excuse me when you bump into someone, please when asking for something, and thank you when someone shows you kindness. Stuff like that. This could have been a teaching moment, but instead you are enabling him to hide when he becomes uncomfortable instead of showing him how to deal with those emotions.", "Info : If Drake is a nephew who you adopted, and Mike is your brother, does that make him Drake's biological father? In that case some Mike might be a little triggering to him. \n\nI will go with NAH. Should a 11 year old have said thank you? Sure. Should you have asked him to? Maybe. But the boy has emotional issues and it's ok to cut him some slack. He wasn't being rude or snippy afterall. It's not something big enough to call someone an asshole.", "This kid is 11 and needs to learn how to say thank you. I understand why he struggles with this but that\u2019s not an excuse or reason not to address it. \n\nWe teach kids from a young age to say thank you when they get presents they don\u2019t like. This is no different. Your nephew can absolutely be shy or feel uneasy about the gift and still say thank you before running off to his room. \n\nYTA", "NTA, I had a similar case as your nephew. I never got close to anyone unless I knew I could trust them with anything. He'll open up more eventually, but it's gonna take some time.", "YTA I understand his upbringing and maybe having concerns but I think if you'd have prompted him to say thank you it would have been an indication that this is a good thing. It would help Drake recognize that this was something he could trust.", "NAH. Your brother was disappointed when the reality didn\u2019t match his expectations. I hope when he has a chance to think about he will take your words to heart. Hopefully all will be forgotten when they have an amazing time.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NAH, because this is a difficult situation.\n\nOn the one hand, your nephew has clearly had trauma which has caused him to mistrust people doing nice things for him,  and his  feelings are valid.\n\nOn the other hand, he does need intense therapy to come to terms with his past and cope for the future. It isn't sustainable to mistrust everyone who is being nice, in the long term. There will be people out there who will want to genuinely be nice to him, who will feel rejected by his reactions and this will affect future potential relationships and friendships. Your brother has a point- when someone does something nice for someone, thanking them is basic manners. To people who don't know your nephew, this could be perceived as rude and ungrateful.\n\nI think the best thing to do as a family is to get your nephew the best professional support you can to allow him to be able to open up to people who care about him, whilst at the same time ensure that your family are aware of the situation and can give allowances for your nephew.", "YTA\n\nYour bro wasn\u2019t asking for a song and dance. For the effort he expected some kind of gratitude. Literally a small thank you. He isn\u2019t asking much.", "It IS ungrateful to not say thank you when you get a gift. I don\u2019t care how hard your life is. Gratitude is a gift you should practice because it benefits you as well as the giver \n\nHowever, uncle Mike needs a lesson in understanding kids. Kids don\u2019t have near the confidence adults do. I know this because I\u2019ve had nieces and nephews for 35 years and they don\u2019t always act like we want them to. And that\u2019s OK.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. The kid didn't ask for the gift. While it's a nice gesture, it was still the uncle's decision to give said gift. Is saying thank you polite? Sure. But if I gave someone a gift they didn't ask for, I wouldn't expect a thank you. It makes me feel good to give gifts, and that's all the thanks I would need.\n\nThank you is said in more than just words. Maybe if we paid more attention, we'd notice it. You also mentioned Drake shows gratitude after the fact, and I think that's perfectly acceptable.", "Your nephew has gone through some difficult times and has had trust issues ever since. Your brother's just gonna ignore that so he can hear a \"thank you\"? \n\nWould it be possible, as a way of earning some trust, if your brother and nephew go to the amusement park (maybe with you, if that makes your nephew more comfortable) as a way to gain trust then?\n\nNTA.", "NAH - It hurts when people brush off your effort with a simple comment but the kids been through a lot. I\u2019m the same way, I don\u2019t react in big ways to big things and that hurts peoples feelings. Saying thank you though should be something you\u2019re working towards.

I was taught to respond with a thank you for any gift\u2026that lead to me saying thank you for used baking pans at my wedding reception to the uncle who sexually assaulted me for the first time when I was three and a half. \n\nGood on you for teaching him to respect himself and his own boundaries.", "YTA\n\nLame excuse for not instilling manners into your kid.", "NTA\n\nI'd have serious concerns about sending Drake off with your brother unsupervised. \n\nIf your brother isn't understanding him and Drake is reacting this way in the safety of your home with you present, consider how overwhelming it will be in the amusement park surrounded by $15 hamburgers, $7 sodas, and any other expenses that come up. \n\nPerhaps send Drake with his own money so he doesn't feel like he has to further rely on anyone for things like food. \n\nIt's one thing to set the expectation for polite behavior, it's not ok for an adult to be offended by a child that is still learning.", "NTA.

Key thing is the apology which you didn't even come close to considering you put rude in quotes.  \n\n\nBecause... here's the reality.  You might be fine with Drake's lack of manners. Drake may have some real good reasons for those quirks.  But everyone else?  They won't care.  They're gonna stop putting in effort.  They're going to stop including him. They're not going to bother inviting him out on stuff.  Why would they?", "NAH, but your brother does have a point. Telling your son to say thank you would be, in my opinion, the right thing to do.

However as Drake's parent, you should have a conversation with him about saying thank you to his uncle. Tell him that it is important to show appreciation when someone does something nice for him. It would make his uncle and you very happy if he said thank you or the tickets. You may also need to prompt him in the moment too when he recieves gifts - just a gentle \"do you want to thank X for the gift?\" is usually enough to prompt the socially appropriate response. It is understandable he struggles with this but it will also hold him back as he gets older if he doesn't know social rules and manners.", "Good catch on the 5 years, that changes my perspective a bit too", "He does after the fact.", "I can bet if he\u2019d said \u201cthanks\u201d in the same tone he\u2019d said \u201cok\u201d in the uncle would have complained that it wasn\u2019t genuine or effusive enough. The uncle thinks his gift buys him a particular performance of happiness and gratitude from a child. I\u2019m not saying the uncle is a terrible person, that\u2019s a common attitude among people who give gifts who don\u2019t think about what they\u2019re really asking from children/traumatized people/neurodivergent people. This creates a stressful situation around gift giving for people who don\u2019t understand or aren\u2019t willing to perform the emotional display socially expected of them. My autistic partner has a lot of trauma around gifts because they say thank you but they never are excited/happy/grateful enough for others and then are punished for their response. Gifts feel like traps they can never respond to correctly.", "He did not say thanks because he needed time to process it. That's why he went into his room/safe place and realized it's a good thing and nothing to worry about.", "I agree with all of this except that I think there is sometimes a difference between being polite and showing gratitude. While showing gratitude and learning who to trust are things that can be worked on over time, teaching him to respond to say thank you when someone does something for you (even small things like holding the door or handing you something) is an easy ask and will benefit the kid greatly. Being polite can get you a long way with teachers and friends\u2019 parents and other people who can potentially have an impact on him. Manners go a long way and aren\u2019t too hard to teach or expect now.", "He\u2019s an 11 year old with trauma, he\u2019s handling it VERY well for a kid his age. He wasn\u2019t rude, he was just shy and uncomfortable. It takes time to move past trauma and the kid is only 11. He\u2019s got plenty of time", "He's not like that with everyone.

Like most parents teach their kids to say thank you?", "So teaching a child to say thank you after receiving a gift is wrong and controlling their reactions?", "> He doesn't get to control his nephews reactions.\n\nThat's ridiculous. If his nephew decided to get violent when he gets upset or starts swearing at adults, he has every right to enforce appropriate behaviour. Kids don't get to just be giant AHs and everyone else in the family has to smile about it.", "He does trust people and actually has a very close knit of friends who he is very social, affectionate and playful with.", "NTA, your brother sucks for treating gifts as transactional, especially toward a child", "I just realized why I dread Christmas and hate my birthday now after 47 years", "> I can bet if he\u2019d said \u201cthanks\u201d in the same tone he\u2019d said \u201cok\u201d in the uncle would have complained that it wasn\u2019t genuine or effusive enough.\n\nMaybe, but he'd have less of a point, right?\n\n> The uncle thinks his gift buys him a particular performance of happiness and gratitude from a child.\n\nReality is, most people aren't completely selfless. If someone makes them feel bad when they give a generous gift, they're probably going to stop giving gifts.\n\n> they never are excited/happy/grateful enough for others and then are punished for their response\n\nCome on now. If we're going to turn this into the black and white issue you're trying to make it, then \"ok\" and running to your room is clearly on the obviously wrong side of the line. Any neurodivergent/child/traumatised person can learn to at least say \"thank you very much\" to get it over the line into acceptable.\n\nIf we're going to allow nuance, then doing the best you can and employing strategies is important for people who have natural responses that upset and alienate people if they want to be socially successful. Parents and families teach kids, and if they're struggling there's professional help. Autism is a good example of a problem that can be largely mitigated for a lot of people with strategies that can be learned.\n\nThe kid is 11 years old. It's old enough to be capable of learning social norms. His life will suck if he doesn't learn them, and he needs to be taught whether that's at home or in a professional setting. The first basic step is to improve from \"ok\" to \"thanks\" and if you're resisting even that I'm not sure its possible for me to convince you of anything.", "Do you think if you had responded with \u201cI know, it\u2019s something we\u2019re working on and I\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t immediately say thank you.

He didn't say thanks because he hasn't been taught how to make polite default responses. Even if he doesn't want to go to the park and doesn't trust his uncle, the correct default response is \"thanks\" and then to run off and process it.\n\nIf you don't learn polite default responses as a child you're going to be perceived as very rude when you're an adult.\n\nIf he's an extremely traumatised kid who hasn't been taught then it's obviously not his fault, but he's old enough to have this mastered and you need to get him there. It's not ok that you're letting him stagnate. This is a very simple adjustment that makes a huge difference to the way people respond to you.", "After he processed did he come out and thank his Uncle or call him with a Thanks?", "People don\u2019t understand trauma responses, you and he shouldn\u2019t be downvoted for this.", "I don't know though. See we know this kid has, for the majority of his life (6 years vs 5 years), trauma. We don't know how extensive. Perhaps people who go above and beyond may have expected things from him that hurt.

Teaching him to respond to kind gestures with a simple thank you is not hard and it will benefit him when interacting with other people.", "Well he didn't show any and you're happy to make excuses for him.\n\nDon't complain when people stop bothering with him altogether, you'll only have yourself to blame for defending this behaviour.", "Got it.\n\nHope they have a great time.", "But the way you have described him acting does unfortunately sound like something that would make a bad impression on teachers, other parents, and at some point future employers/mentors. It's not fair, but he will have a harder time if he doesn't get over that behavior.", "I don\u2019t know that we have enough info that that\u2019s the case. The brother is also this kid\u2019s uncle and may want what\u2019s best for him. He may be coming from a place of wanting this kid to have manners to navigate other similar situations.", "That's like being expected to kiss someone back to him", "But he wasn't rude?", "Trauma as severe as this kiddo seems to have can create emotions that it\u2019s actually NOT safe or healthy to confront in the moment.", "Saying he doesn't have manners is like saying a kid doesn't have manners for not kissing back a relative.", "He's functional. People see him as a very loving and affectionate kid because he has a very few select group of people he is close with. He will think nothing about giving me a hug and letting me kiss him at school. Maybe some people expect the same affection from him and are disappointed.", "No. Saying \u201cthank you\u201d isn\u2019t like giving up bodily autonomy.", "Well it isn't. A gift doesn't violate his right to bodily autonomy.", "But it's not at all like that?", "People of Reddit love telling other folks how to raise their kids. I think you are doing well.", "Refusing thank you for a gift is pretty rude, imho", "Yeah, and?", "No but unfortunately a part of his brain is wired to think that a gift is sometimes a precursor to that.", "That's how his brain is wired. He gets triggered and it becomes flight or fight.", "You need to work with him to unwire that then. All you have to do is talk to him and say that when people give gifts you should say thank you", "I think you are letting your emotions cloud your judgement here. I understand you are protective of him and are empathetic to what he has experienced. \nAs a parent though, you need to teach your kids manners, and when kids struggle with something, for whatever reason, it\u2019s the parent\u2019s job to help them navigate and work through it. Making excuses for him doesn\u2019t help him. It actually hurts him. \n\nPart of manners is saying thank you when someone does something for you, whether you mean it or not. You use manners when you don\u2019t feel like it, when you are having a bad day, and even when you don\u2019t actually care about the gesture someone made. Nobody is asking this kid to give uncle a big hug, to show excitement, or to do anything that requires emotional energy. He can still run off to his room to process. The only difference is that instead of \u201cok\u201d, he says \u201cthank you\u201d while running off. It\u2019s a small ask but it\u2019s the first step in teaching him how to navigate these situations."]}
