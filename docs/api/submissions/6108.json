N. T. A. For feeling slighted and cast aside by your parents poor performance and planning in this matter.   Set your expectations accordingly for the future.   They will not be there for you the way they will for your sister and her kids.  It sucks.  And it hurts and it\u2019s ok for you to feel that \n\nyour parents will expect you to take care of yourself and will spend themselves dry to take care of your sister.   Let HER be their retirement plan and support plan.  Not your problem unless they start trying to use you to fund their lives after they run out of time /money.", "They have money for retirement in stocks and real estate which is in a family trust.. But my assumption is that since my dad (65M) is retired and they only have one income stream for cash right now, they are just more cautious and believe I don\u2019t need anything from them. My mom (59f) still works, and their house isn\u2019t paid off yet. There is value in the trust, but it\u2019s just not in cash at this time.", "I concur with YTA, but I want to make the point that I don\u2019t think OP is the AH for feeling slighted or for expressing that. The AH came when she pressed the point, including trying to \u201cnegotiate\u201d what her parents would give her.", "OP also has cars and and a house, but still wants her parents to go broke giving her cash.  I hope the husband knew what he was  getting into.", "Completely agree. Also how did they spent over $30,000 on a wedding at her parents, that seems insane", "> What do you want them to do, create cash out of thin air?\n\nNo, she wants them to raid their retirement accounts.", "Exactly! My friend is on a good income and so is his wife. He refuses to gift tons of money for a wedding but will happily do it for something like a house.", "Devil's advocate here but is it possible they aren't in the same financial position because they're supporting their grown-ass child who seems to be incapable of making it on their own?\n\nThat would be a drain on anyone's finances...\n\nBut either way, OP's not owed any amount of cash as a gift, that's completely discretionary and she still got a shit ton of money regardless.", "We had a two day wedding, one day was cultural ceremony, the second day was American reception.", "'Negotiation' my ass. She was bullying them. She knows they don't have that sort of money now.", "This 100%. My older brother was given everything he asked for and had all of my parents attention. He is now 47 and still lives with my parents. According to OP, I should tally up everything they have ever spent on each of us and demand the difference. OP feels entitles to her parents money which she has no claim on. She is being petty and entitled.", "What is LC?", "BRIDEZILLA (n.): see u/TouristNo6387, 22 minutes ago", "It\u2019s been a few months since everything, and I haven\u2019t brought it up or made a fuss since. We are all on good terms, I just live far away and think it adds to the resentment.", "Exactly!!!!!", "Exactly! My mom gives all her money to my younger brothers. I couldn't care less. She was emotionally abusive when I was growing up so good riddance to her and her money.", "Just add info OP expects the parents to pull money from there retirement fund to give her the money", "What is ESH?", "You want them to pull from their retirement to give you a wedding gift? No. You don\u2019t get to ask them to do that, and it\u2019s fucked up you\u2019d even think about it.", "Sorry what? You want them to spend their retirement fund on your wedding?\n\nRead what you just said. Of course you're in the wrong.", "So I guess back to the original question, how do you expect them to come up with the cash? \n\nMaybe they don't need every cent for retirement but it doesn't take much to get wiped out. And if that happens, the burden shifts to siblings or kids. You want your parents to have a cushion in case anything goes wrong in retirement.", "Tell me, if your parents shortchange their retirement fund to give you more cash, are you going to support them when they run short on cash in a few years?", "So you *think\" they're OK for the future. But don't know.\n\nYou'd rather that you had what you view as financial equity at their risk for their retirement.\n\nIf you want to do the extended family living thing, then maybe you would benefit more. But you don't actually want that level of family involvement do you? Only their money!", "You want to fuck up your parents retirement after the gave you literal thousands of dollars, and lend you their house for two full days, just for the sake of 'fairness'??? You would rather they struggle when they are older so you can feel validated. That's sick. You have issues. \n\nAlso, I think it's hilarious you call yourself the independent child and then whine when they only give you a smaller amount of thousands of dollars.", "Holy crap YTA!\n\nDon't retire mommy, I feel slighted because the thousands of dollars I got doesn't make me feel special enough and I think you should sacrifice your future for my precious little feelings \n\nGo apologize. Now", "Holy crap.. you are definitely the asshole. You want your parents to go broke to gift you something?  Wow.. you need therapy", "Their retirement money needs to last them the rest of their lives. That could be 30 years or more.", "Are you being serious? You want them to take money from retirement funds to give you? No. You are beinh selfish. They have much more things to worry about now. It sucks but that's what happens in life. Your expectation to have them take off money from their retirement funds is completely disgusting, actually. YTA.", "Your absolutely the asshole after reading this little tidbit. God I hope they have room in there for you if you become this entitled with your husband.", "So what is that you don\u2019t understand? They don\u2019t have it. They are retired. If they are being cautious that  should tell you they aren\u2019t in the financial position to live up to your expectations. My parents are retired and very similar to your parents. They can only allocate so much money per year without getting penalties or fines for withdrawing more than they had anticipated. I\u2019m the youngest of 3. Due to financial changes over time when it was my turn to attend college they couldn\u2019t pay for all of it like my older siblings. I had to take loans and pay for the remainder after what they helped generously helped with. Same as all of our weddings and other life events. As time goes on the finances changed over time and I ended up with the least. I don\u2019t feel slighted. I feel grateful they were willing to help me at all. \n\nYTA. The fact your financially independent and can\u2019t understand your parents situation is worrisome.", "Is this real? Be honest.", "You don't get to ask your parents to pull from their money that they need to live on when they get older to give you a gift. What's wrong with you? \n\nMom and Dad at 90: Were struggling to pay our utilities and property tax. Can hardly afford to buy food.\n\nOP: Thanks for starving yourself so you can give me thousands of dollars for my wedding. \n\nYou shouldn't have needed to ask this question op.", "except the sister is being rewarded by being a mooch with more money and free childcare.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out. Was Franck from Father of the Bride the wedding planner?", "Exactly, my parents spent a lot of money on my sister but they did their best to make it fair. They don't have the money now because they are supporting OPs sister and children.\n\nOP has learned that her parents will put her sister first and shouldn't expect anything from them, financially and probably emotionally in the future. But that's ok. Take if from the sister that didn't call up her parents everytime they hit a road bump or dropped her kids off every weekend or needed them for multiple legal court cases. You will be better off in the long run. Your marriage will be stronger, you will be more resilient,  you'll make stronger friendships and have a good work ethic because you know that you are capable and mature.", "That's my thinking as well", "Yes, but I'd like to point out that we don't know the whole story about the other sibling so I suggest reserving judgement about them because shit happens and sometimes people need help. Also OP likely doesn't know all the details about that arrangement either.", "But that doesn\u2019t make a difference, even if that is the reason it still doesn\u2019t make them magically have the cash to give to OP.", "THIS!", "It actually took me a few months to ask because I knew they just bought my sister another car\u2026", "It means Low Contact", "The resentment should not be from the monies given or not given. From the post it sounds like there is more going on in the family, other than money. Best of luck.", "OP,\n\nWithout going into details, something similar happened with my inlaws. It created a lot of hurt feelings because it wasn't about money, it was about feeling equally loved and valued as children.\n\nBut, I'm also privileged to know that my inlaws would have loved to gift all their kids equally for their weddings. It just wasn't an option because circumstances changed and they weren't willing to let one of their kids bankrupt or starve himself. This meant they didn't have the same resources for a wedding gift. They felt embarrassed and upset about that for a long time, even though they didn't really tell much of anyone their side.\n\nNot trying to invalidate your feelings. I'm sure it feels bad to get so much less of a gift. But, it may help for you to try to dig into what your feelings are and extend some empathy to yourself and other family for being in an unwinnable situation.", "Everyone Sucks Here", "THIS! OP you are definitely an entitled AH.", "I don\u2019t know their exact net worth, they\u2019ve done well to hide that. I do know they are comfortable but they are still supporting an adult child , her boyfriend and their grandchild, which is probably what is preventing retirement. I guess there is more context I could\u2019ve provided. But the time I was negotiating for equal treatment was the same time they just bought her another car. It bothered me but I see now from public opinion that I should just be thankful that I don\u2019t need anything and move on.", "I\u2019m not creative enough to make it up", "Those parents did a bang up job, didn't they?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "You misspelled \u2018beg\u2019. Got that for you.", "That detail should me in the OP. They aren\u2019t able to do for you what they did for her because they are still supplementing her life.", "People who are financially better of than 98.7% of the population will still find ridiculous shit to be upset about. 10 years ago your sister received more money than you...my god look at all the things you have to be grateful for and let this pettiness go", "It's not so much \"hiding\"  it as it is none of your business!", "I'm glad that you do see this.\n\nEquitable is only really ever an option at the same point in time, imo.\n\nHad you married when she did, then things may have been very different.\n\nCongratulations on the marriage.", "Holy crap NTA while your parents technically don\u2019t owe you anything they clearly favor your sister as the golden child .. Not only supporting a grown ass woman her own child and a BF like WTF!! Buying her ANOTHER car, does she or freeloading bf work do they contribute ? Why can\u2019t they buy their own car\u2026 I doubt your parents will ever retire completely at this point while still having to support all of them. I\u2019m sure sister will move on once they are broke and then it will be on you to take care of them in old age ..Good for you on being financially independent and successful in your life !! Their obvious favoritism deserves NC let them live what they sow\u2026", "Good. I hope this is true.", "Good. I hope this is true."]}
