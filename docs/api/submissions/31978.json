She's been absolutely obsessed with kpop since she was around 13. She's been listening, going to concerts and making dance videos. \n\nThe problem is, her absolute dream is to become a kpop star is Korea, and she's certain that a kpop manager will notice her and take her there to make her a kpop idol. She quit highschool when she was 16 to train singing and dancing. She moved in with me because she couldn't find a job, and we agreed that she will help me with taking care of grandma or help around the house. (giving her meds, bathing, cleaning etc)\nShe was a member of a dancing team for a year and she would make some money by doing performances with them, but she quit because she wanted a \"solo carrier\", and she didn't have any job since then. \nOur parents have been paying money to me for taking her in, but three months ago dad had to quit his job because of an injury he got. Now, they can only pay for half of the rent, and I gave her a notice that she will have to move out if she can't find a job in a month. She claimed that she was working hard for her dreams, and I called her delusional for still believing that she'll become a kpop idol. I told her at this point she may even need professional help. \nThe month went by and she still doesn't have a  job, and our mother have been calling me to not kick her out and let her experience her dreams in peace, and to stop abusing her. I told her I was not abusing her, but I can't take care of grandma and her. \nI talked to grandma about her. Grandma told me that she's been barely helping her, she wouldn't cook because she can't, she does clean tho, but doesn't go buy groceries or grandma's meds. I told my sister she will have to move out next week, she had a notice, and I asked her multiple times to find a job already.

Chasing your dreams doesn\u2019t mean living on other people\u2019s dime and not having to work to make ends meet. If your mom wants to talk about who is being abusive, Frankly, it\u2019s your parents and sister who are putting you in an abusive situation, forcing you to do all the care taking of your grandma and sister.

Are you sure your sister is 20? \nShe's VERY delusional.", "NTA\n\nThere are tons of celebrities who worked (shitty) jobs, while trying to realize their dreams.\n\nThere are tons of professionals who worked jobs, while pursuing the education they need.\n\nYour adult sister can easily work AND pursue her (unrealistic) dream.\n\nAt the *very, very* least she can take PROPER care of your grandmother.\n\nShe, and your parents, need a reality check.", "NTA. As a kpop fan (since 2012 bro), she should be aware that the market is *heavily* saturated. by no means is it wrong for her to dream and work on it but she can't be **dead weight.** a lot of kpop idols had part time jobs while training and was still able to debut so its not an excuse to not work.\n\nyou're not out of the line. you've been very understanding and have given more than sufficient warning. if she isn't at home minding the house and your grandma, what the fuck is she doing with her life? fangirling 24/7? unacceptable.", "NTA. Even if she\u2019s several years younger, drop dead gorgeous, ethnically Korean (non-mixed), incredibly talented in song, dance, and perhaps even songwriting, and fluent in Korean as well as other languages, there\u2019s very little chance she\u2019ll become a kpop star, let alone debut or even get signed on to an agency. There are far too many young girls and women who outdo her in every aspect and even they have very little chance of making it in the hellscape that is the Korean entertainment industry.", "I\u2019m a 2nd gen kpop fan. Your sister, at 20, is about 6 years older than what they want in trainees, let alone a solo star. She has no chance. None, zero, absolutely non-existent. That they are feeding her delusions is bad enough, you can\u2019t be expected to shoulder the burden. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
