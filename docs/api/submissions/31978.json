Is she even Korean, or even Asian for that matter? because most of the people I see with this dream aren't\n\n2. As harsh as it sounds, at 20 she's already considered 'old' by kpop agencies, especially now when trainees are only getting younger and younger. \n\nSo no, you're NTA for not supporting the unrealistic pipe dream.", "NTA I am a Kpop fan and everyone dreams of being a star from time time. But when you look at it reasonably there are only 1-2 Kpop stars that are western. And those are half Asian. The others are all Korean, Chinese, Indonesian. Most train since 11 years old, some since 6 and some since 15. they are extremely beautiful and went under the knife. You also have to speak Korean. Most trainees land in some unsuccessful band. And if A new band wants to become number one another has to fall to the ground first to make space. At 20 you have 0%chance to audition at a Kpop company and be accepted. Even if you were accepted as a trainee it\u2019s super hard, you can\u2019t eat anything, train 24/7, and if there\u2019s a completely made up rumour about you having been a bully 6 years prior, your career is over.", "NTA If your parents are so bothered, she can move in with them.

Realistically speaking, your sister being 20 is already way too old to be a trainee and to even debut. Nowadays they are casting for people 2005/6 and above (which obviously is insane but that\u2019s a discussion for another day) and then getting to audition and get into a decent company is even slimmer pickings. If your sister was such a kpop fan, she would already know this. \n\nIt just sounds like she doesn\u2019t wanna take responsibility. KPOP does tend to take over your life, I have been through it myself and it is hard to get out of. I don\u2019t know if she needs \u201cprofessional help\u201d but getting a job will hopefully help her. Also OP said your sister isn\u2019t even Asian which is a WHOLE OTHER layer of not getting in.\n\nIf she really wants to live with you, maybe discuss how she can show you she is actively looking for a job WITH PROOF. Tell her she needs to do more chores, help out etc. At this point, her career and her dream aren\u2019t going to happen and she has to be realistic. Encourage her to do it as a hobby once she is financially stable. I\u2019m not sure where you live but there are many dance clubs and organizations centered around kpop that do covers and performances that could help her feel like she\u2019s living her \u201cdream\u201d.\n\nHere is a logistical post you can show her to make her understand how difficult it is\n\n[odds of being kpop idol](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/hhcz0b/putting_the_odds_of_being_a_kpop_idol_into/)", "I know someone who was a K-pop trainee.

And not only that but she was sorted into the 'D-group' - meaning it wouldn't be likely that she would ever be part of a popular group (like the 'A' or 'B group' members). She dropped out after a year. \n\nK-pop is a well oiled machine, and K-pop stars are usually manufactured at a very young age.  Competition is fierce, and even if you make it as a trainee, the likelihood of making it is slim to none. \n\nIt's great that your sister has aspirations, but she needs to temper that with reality and take responsibility of her life.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Plus, it's pretty common knowledge within KPOP stans that right now, idols are debuting at VERY young ages. At 20, not even being in an agency, there isn't much chance of her debuting.

They tell her she\u2019s not crazy and to chase her dreams and to take it seriously and all that!!!

Other people can't be bankrolling her choices forever. \n\nI'm reminded of a random interview I saw a number of years ago (but way less far back than you'd think) about a guy who wanted to be an action film actor in Hollywood, living here in the UK. And that's with very little awareness of how many movies like that are still being made, very little acting prowess, and (sadly this was a major feature I remembered) late 90s to 2000s spiked gel hair that he seemingly liked but felt massively behind the times. And he was already mid 30s, possibly working in trade but his wife was definitely supporting him regularly.

It's worst for black people, but white people and Latinx are definitely not immune.", "they are still usually asian foreigners, though. most non-korean idols are japanese, chinese, or thai, with a few indonesian and indian idols debuting in the last couple of years. the only non-asian idols i can think of are most of the members of blackswan, but having no east asian members is their gimmick, it's not just something that randomly happened.", "theres no rule against kpop idols dating. i think you are confusing it with jpop. kpop idols do have similar bf/gf images, but they dont completely rely on it like jpop idols do. many famous idols, including jennie and jisoo of blackpink, jihyo and momo from twice, and soloists hyuna and iu have all openly dated. as long as it is with another popular celebrity, only the small minority of really delusional fans get mad about it.\n\nas for songwriting, that's about as common in kpop nowadays as it is in western pop. a lot of popular western singers either dont write their music at all, or change a word or two just so they can get the royalties associated with writing credits, but arent really writing. kpop acts such as seventeen, (g)i-dle, and stray kids all have members that write all of the music for their respective groups.\n\nwhat china does is not connected to south korea. lisa is still very much a huge, beloved star in korea. china has been cracking down on the growing popularity of korean pop culture among chinese young people over the last few years, and this is just another part of that.\n\nofc, the kpop scene has a lot of issues. the part about them not seeing a dime for years is very true. some groups never go big, and that ends up landing the members with a lot of debt. please look up the lawsuits between blockberry creative and the members of their group, loona, as well as the lawsuits brought up by the group omega x if you want to know more. there is also sexual harassment, eating disorders, untreated health problems, and other such instances of mistreatment that are super common.\n\nhowever, saying that kpop is sooooooo much worse than the western pop industry is simply false. it downplays how terrible the music industry is the us particularly, and makes it seem like anyone who goes into it is an idiot. more realistically, both the kpop industry and western pop industry are about equally as bad, they just have some cultural differences.", "that is bizarre, I'd say her parents encouragement normalized it for her but like there's no way she's 40 and no one has told her that's it's not normal or explained that it's not happening \ud83d\ude36 that would be so surreal if you didn't know her well and didn't know the situation at all and you asked if she was married or smth then suddenly NICK CARTER", "Isn't this cultural appropriation? Am I crazy? It's one thing to be a fan, but if she's literally not Korean, how does she expect to be a kpop star? Does she at least speak Korean? I'm so confused. \n\nMind you, I love K-dramas etc, so I'm a fan, but I'm also not Korean, so I'd never have delusions of butting in & trying to star in any of those movies or TV shows. I'm happy being a fan. \n\nPeople who aspire to the arts usually work their butts off in other \"day\" jobs until they make it. The younger sis needs to get a job. \n\nNTA", "The engineer to youtuber pipeline is real lmao", "Why kpop & not whichever country you're in pop? \n\nGranted either way you're NTA/being totally reasonable in wanting her to hold up her end of the deal.", "NTA. \n\nI'm sure it was a lovely dream for her, and there have been (vanishingly few) non-Korean performers in that field. But even if she were absolutely fantastic, the odds of getting picked up at 20 are pretty close to zero. It might be sad, she might be devastated, but the window is closed, and she needs a reality check. There are plenty of other performance options at many levels, if indeed she's talented and works hard, though she needs to get a \"normal\" job while she pursues that.\n\nIf it were me, I'd give her some more time, even though you've given her enough. The clear threat and indication you're serious might light a fire under her. She can get something, but even though she's delusional, it can be hard to break out of that mindset. But certainly there's no moral or familial obligation to. You've given her plenty of runway already.\n\nBut nah, this isn't cultural appropriation. Let's not water down that concept.", "there *are* foreign idols debuting in the kpop industry but they're trained to be fluent in korean since it IS their target market. \n\nnot a matter of cultural appropriation but foreign idols (fuck being an idol, imagine their lives as trainees good lord) are under a heavier scrutiny with the racism/colorism (unreal societal expectations notwithstanding. that's a whole other ball game whew). \n\nthe korean audience is fucking vicious resulting to a lot of idols suffering and ultimately deciding to take their own life.", "Ok, thanks for clarification. I wasn't sure, and I agree with not watering it down. \ud83d\udc4d And excellent point about the age too.\n\nWhy focus only on kpop? She could be a singer & dancer in pop music without specifying a country like that. Just pursue performing. WHILE HAVING A DAY JOB. Lol", "While it's not appropriation, there is a not uncommon sentiment among some, especially younger, USians that it's just cooler, and there's possibly some exoticization. There's also that it's a specific kind of musical and performance style. But also just, sometimes people get something in their head and can't let it go. But aspiring to kpop performance is different from aspiring to performance generally.\n\nYour last point is very salient. People can and do and should exist in the world and support themselves in some other way while pursuing their dreams."]}
