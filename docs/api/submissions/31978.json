As a kpop fan (since 2012 bro), she should be aware that the market is *heavily* saturated. by no means is it wrong for her to dream and work on it but she can't be **dead weight.** a lot of kpop idols had part time jobs while training and was still able to debut so its not an excuse to not work.\n\nyou're not out of the line. you've been very understanding and have given more than sufficient warning. if she isn't at home minding the house and your grandma, what the fuck is she doing with her life? fangirling 24/7? unacceptable.", "NTA.

There are far too many young girls and women who outdo her in every aspect and even they have very little chance of making it in the hellscape that is the Korean entertainment industry.", "I\u2019m a 2nd gen kpop fan.

Is she even Korean, or even Asian for that matter? because most of the people I see with this dream aren't\n\n2. As harsh as it sounds, at 20 she's already considered 'old' by kpop agencies, especially now when trainees are only getting younger and younger. \n\nSo no, you're NTA for not supporting the unrealistic pipe dream.", "NTA I am a Kpop fan and everyone dreams of being a star from time time. But when you look at it reasonably there are only 1-2 Kpop stars that are western. And those are half Asian. The others are all Korean, Chinese, Indonesian. Most train since 11 years old, some since 6 and some since 15. they are extremely beautiful and went under the knife. You also have to speak Korean. Most trainees land in some unsuccessful band. And if A new band wants to become number one another has to fall to the ground first to make space. At 20 you have 0%chance to audition at a Kpop company and be accepted. Even if you were accepted as a trainee it\u2019s super hard, you can\u2019t eat anything, train 24/7, and if there\u2019s a completely made up rumour about you having been a bully 6 years prior, your career is over.", "NTA If your parents are so bothered, she can move in with them. Odds are they were tired of this crap and got her to move in with you for the peace, and now dont want her coming back to them", "NTA. Big KPOP fan here. Realistically speaking, your sister being 20 is already way too old to be a trainee and to even debut. Nowadays they are casting for people 2005/6 and above (which obviously is insane but that\u2019s a discussion for another day) and then getting to audition and get into a decent company is even slimmer pickings. If your sister was such a kpop fan, she would already know this. \n\nIt just sounds like she doesn\u2019t wanna take responsibility. KPOP does tend to take over your life, I have been through it myself and it is hard to get out of. I don\u2019t know if she needs \u201cprofessional help\u201d but getting a job will hopefully help her. Also OP said your sister isn\u2019t even Asian which is a WHOLE OTHER layer of not getting in.\n\nIf she really wants to live with you, maybe discuss how she can show you she is actively looking for a job WITH PROOF. Tell her she needs to do more chores, help out etc. At this point, her career and her dream aren\u2019t going to happen and she has to be realistic. Encourage her to do it as a hobby once she is financially stable. I\u2019m not sure where you live but there are many dance clubs and organizations centered around kpop that do covers and performances that could help her feel like she\u2019s living her \u201cdream\u201d.\n\nHere is a logistical post you can show her to make her understand how difficult it is\n\n[odds of being kpop idol](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/hhcz0b/putting_the_odds_of_being_a_kpop_idol_into/)", "I know someone who was a K-pop trainee. She started at ELEVEN years old. And not only that but she was sorted into the 'D-group' - meaning it wouldn't be likely that she would ever be part of a popular group (like the 'A' or 'B group' members). She dropped out after a year. \n\nK-pop is a well oiled machine, and K-pop stars are usually manufactured at a very young age.  Competition is fierce, and even if you make it as a trainee, the likelihood of making it is slim to none. \n\nIt's great that your sister has aspirations, but she needs to temper that with reality and take responsibility of her life.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Plus, it's pretty common knowledge within KPOP stans that right now, idols are debuting at VERY young ages. At 20, not even being in an agency, there isn't much chance of her debuting. She should still dance and be passionate but it would help to be a little realistic? Plus, she should get a job if she plans on relocating to SK, anyways.", "NTA shes utterly delusional. If she can\u2019t pull her weight she doesn\u2019t get to live rent free. She\u2019s already too old to become an idol. Most companies are casting 15-16 year olds. She has no chance", "NTA... your sister is old enough to do adult things. She wont step up so she can move out", "NTA.\n\nWhy did her parents just let her quit high school? And the K-pop industry isn't all rainbows and sunshine, especially for women. I love K-pop, but I hate the industry and how it abuses and exploits idols.  \nHas she tried to audition for any entertainment industry? If so, how many? Does she even speak Korean? Does she have any idea how difficult getting in is, and how difficult it will be for her when she DOES get in? Is she aware of the toxic diet culture? How common eating disorders are? How non-Koreans (especially non-Asians) are put to extremely high standards in the industry?", "NTA like........what???", "NTA.  Make sure that you provide your sister with any required legal notices in your jurisdiction.", "Has she even been applying or going to audition casting events?  At 20, it's already pretty late in the Kpop world to begin training.  \n\nIf she isn't at the very least part Asian, her chances plummet to almost 0%...", "Am I missing something? Are you in Korea? Don\u2019t you have to be Korean to be a K-pop idol? If you\u2019re in any country besides Korea NTA for that fact alone\n\nIf you\u2019re in Korea still NTA because it\u2019s a pipe dream", "I don't know much about K-pop nor the industry around it.\n\nBut I guess dreaming of being a K-pop star is the kind of dream that has an expiration date?\n\nLike, if she's 20 and hasn't been picked up, then it's very likely it will not happen? Kinda like if your dream is to play in the NFL but you're already 30 and it hasn't happened, then it's not happening?", "it\u2019s crazy to me people want into the kpop idol world. those companies are brutal to their idols, they dance for so many hours a day, practice so many hours a day. countless idols have collapsed due to exhaustion during performances (one that i remember vividly was jungkook, i think even jimin has fainted). it\u2019s not a career i\u2019d want, seeing how agencies treat their talent.\n\nand OP\u2019s parents are just as crazy as their youngest if they think getting a real job and contributing to the house you\u2019re living in is \u201cabuse\u201d. but no one\u2019s talking about her neglecting poor grandma!\n\nmost idols HAVE to join groups before they can even embark on a solo career. does she not realize how young some idols are when they become trainees? jungkook was 13! he was 15 in their first debut. that dude\u2019s been working his ASS off for over a decade! i\u2019ll take my bakery job over idol any day, idc if i\u2019m not a millionaire at least i have some sanity left lmao", "She's not asian at all.", "This. One guy's idol career was ended because he got married. That's how random and nonsensical their career-ending 'scandals' are.", "Yeah, like I will give crap to America and how they have treated their stars, but Korea is on a whole other level. Many of their celebrities, I clouding K-pop and esports, *aren't allowed to date*. Many of them don't write their own music as well as a chance not to see a *dime* for *years*. \n\nLike look at the drama with Lisa from Blackpink. From the little that I know, she did a sexy/provocative performance of some kind while going solo, and now she is banned and blacklisted in China.\n\nThis might be American/western of me, but why doesn't OP sister start a YouTube channel? Make covers, make their own music, their dance, etc, etc. This can help her create a portfolio or get discover like Ado, who is J-pop , or NateWantsToBattle in the States.", "Can she even speak Korean?", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s very western of you to suggest that! i think it would be a good compromise. doing cover videos, choreography ones too, while still working on the side like so many other youtubers!\n\nit still blows my mind that markiplier used to build decks and was so few credits away from a damn impressive degree (not that the work he does now isn\u2019t, just that it\u2019s a different vein)", "She used to study Korean in highschool before she quit, I'm not sure about her knowledge", "Then you\u2019re NTA. She\u2019s 20, not even asian and not fluent in Korean. Kpop idols don\u2019t start solo anyways."]}
