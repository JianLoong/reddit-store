The taste, texture and smell of them she cannot stand. She's not a picky eater by any means, but just doesn't like mushrooms.\n\nMy mil lives with us and helps us by watching my daughter when she gets home from school. She makes dinner the nights we're working late for our daughter, as mil loves to cook so she ensured us that it would be no trouble for her to make our daughter dinner most nights. My husband and I both work in the medical field, so we have crazy unpredictable schedules and are not home most nights to make dinner. Last night my husband and I both had the night off work and were making dinner together, mil went out for dinner with friends, Susie came to us crying saying how she is sick and tired of being starved most nights and if we can please make her dinners instead of MIL.\n\nIt's very public knowledge that Susie doesn't like mushrooms, but yet for the past few weeks every SINGLE dish that my mil has made for Susie has had the main component of mushrooms in it. Portobello mushroom burgers, mushroom risotto, mushroom pasta etc. These dishes aren't made when either myself or my husband are around, but when we aren't that's all Susie is served to eat. She told us that if she politely refuses to eat these dishes, my mil will tell her to \"suit herself but she's not getting any other food the rest of the night\" and that she \"has to outgrow this stupid mushroom hatred\". Both my husband and I were extremely upset that our child is going to bed hungry every night due to my mil only making her dinners with the ONE ingredient she doesn't like and not allowing her to eat anything else.\n\nWhen MIL got home we confronted her about this. She started going off saying that Susie needs to grow up and get over this stupid hatred of mushrooms. I told her that she's essentially starving her granddaughter. She disagreed and said it's tough love. She then proceeded to call me and shit mother for prioritizing my career over my child and helping her get over this dislike towards a vegetable. I told her to get out of my house because she will not disrespect me like that. She ended up leaving but had some nasty thing's to say to me on the way out.\n\nMy husband is 100% on my side and feels that his mother is out of line. We've been getting non stop messages from my 2 SIL's and my MIL calling us every name in the book for kicking her out and that my daughter needs to get over herself.

Many adults don't like mushrooms (such as other food like seafood, courgettes, Brussel sprouts, etc...) and nobody would dream to force them to eat a food they hate. Besides, it's not that mushrooms hold a special nutrition value or vitamines, and it's not that your daugther is refusing to eat vegetables in general.\n\nMIL was wrong and inappropriate. And, if I were you, I would sit your daugther down and try to discover if MIL used \"tough love\" in other circumstances with her.", "NTA\n\n\nTell your husband that his mother needs to leave.

She knows what she's doing is wrong because she doesn't do it when you or your husband are around. It's not \"tough love\", it's child abuse and every day you allow her to watch your child in your absence is another opportunity for that abuse to continue.\n\nShe's being doing this for weeks? You should have kicked her out weeks ago. Your daughter isn't getting the food she needs. She's a child, her body needs to grow, childhood malnutrition can have permanent deleterious effects: loss of stature, lesser educational attainment, lower lifetime earnings.

They're not vegetables, they're fungi.", "NTA. It's your house. Your daughter doesn't like ONE thing. Not everybody like's everything. Some people never \"grow out\" of the things they don't like.

Deliberately making the one thing your daughter doesn't like - to the extent that she'd rather not eat at all - is horrible.

MIL is the immature, petty asshole here", "NTA\n\nMIL is so weird. I always have my child try an ingredient at least once and then I don\u2019t serve that again if they dislike it. Maybe once a year (sometimes longer) we try it again (one bite) just to see if they still don\u2019t like it. Taste buds change and we\u2019ve had some happy surprises with that.

Sounds like she's just pushing her luck in general .", "NTA. My children each have a few things they don\u2019t care for - mushrooms and fish are the main ones. I don\u2019t stop using them in my meal plan but I always make sure they have alternative options on those days.

Not enough parents do.", "NTA - MIL isn\u2019t there for mushroom conversion therapy! Good for your kiddo for speaking up.

What she did was horrible, both starving your kid and treating you like crap.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nWhat your MIL did was hostile to your daugther and sneaky, since she only did it when you were away.

How do you let someone care for your child who would say you were a bad mom, won't follow your rules or what you say as parents, and now you can't really trust their judgement to take care of your kid. \n\nYour life is gonna be hard for a few weeks without her there to take care of your child, but trust it is the best decision.", "NTA, and thank you, wholeheartedly for sticking up for your daughter.", "NTA 100% There was a rule when I was growing up \u201cif you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to eat it, but you have to try it.\u201d As long as I tried something and then said I didn\u2019t like it, it was fine. No forced eating. Unfortunately, I had a grandmother who did exactly that to me and my sister. When she babysat me and my sister, we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the table until we finished everything in our plate, because she didn\u2019t believe in wasting food\u2026or saving food for later.

I'm a grown ass woman in my 40s and am a very picky eater.  Granted I make my own food and eat what I want, but if you don't like something, you don't like it and you shouldn't be forced to eat it.  The fact that she is purposely only making dishes with mushrooms, seems like a control issue to me.

The taste, texture and smell of them she cannot stand. She's not a picky eater by any means, but just doesn't like mushrooms.\n\nMy mil lives with us and helps us by watching my daughter when she gets home from school. She makes dinner the nights we're working late for our daughter, as mil loves to cook so she ensured us that it would be no trouble for her to make our daughter dinner most nights. My husband and I both work in the medical field, so we have crazy unpredictable schedules and are not home most nights to make dinner. Last night my husband and I both had the night off work and were making dinner together, mil went out for dinner with friends, Susie came to us crying saying how she is sick and tired of being starved most nights and if we can please make her dinners instead of MIL.\n\nIt's very public knowledge that Susie doesn't like mushrooms, but yet for the past few weeks every SINGLE dish that my mil has made for Susie has had the main component of mushrooms in it. Portobello mushroom burgers, mushroom risotto, mushroom pasta etc. These dishes aren't made when either myself or my husband are around, but when we aren't that's all Susie is served to eat. She told us that if she politely refuses to eat these dishes, my mil will tell her to \"suit herself but she's not getting any other food the rest of the night\" and that she \"has to outgrow this stupid mushroom hatred\". Both my husband and I were extremely upset that our child is going to bed hungry every night due to my mil only making her dinners with the ONE ingredient she doesn't like and not allowing her to eat anything else.\n\nWhen MIL got home we confronted her about this. She started going off saying that Susie needs to grow up and get over this stupid hatred of mushrooms. I told her that she's essentially starving her granddaughter. She disagreed and said it's tough love. She then proceeded to call me and shit mother for prioritizing my career over my child and helping her get over this dislike towards a vegetable. I told her to get out of my house because she will not disrespect me like that. She ended up leaving but had some nasty thing's to say to me on the way out.\n\nMy husband is 100% on my side and feels that his mother is out of line. We've been getting non stop messages from my 2 SIL's and my MIL calling us every name in the book for kicking her out and that my daughter needs to get over herself.

Finally she agreed to make it. I was so excited that I didn't eat anything all day in anticipation of that lasagna. Sit down at the dinner table with a huge slice of lasagna... and found mushrooms in it. I burst into tears (I was just a kid. A hungry kid.) Mom got mad at me when I asked why she would put mushrooms in the lasagna that I had begged for. She informed me that my dad loved mushrooms and that he was more important.

I love them now but if my mom had forced me into eating them when I was a kid, I\u2019d probably still hate them.\n\nYou\u2019re doing a good job here. This was a stupid power play on your MIL\u2019s part.", "NTA - but your MIL certainly is. I understand like once in awhile if something came with diced up mushrooms in a sauce and you forgot but this woman was clearly going out of her way to make mushrooms the main component to have a power struggle with your daughter and only when she was left alone with her. What absolutely disgusting behaviour. She is the one that needed a place to stay - tell your SILs that they can take her in then if they are so upset on her behalf. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t bully your granddaughter and still expect a roof over your head. Also kudos to your husband for having yours and your daughters back. You don\u2019t see that very often in these threads", "Holy hell this is the first AITA I\u2019ve read where the husband isn\u2019t on his mother\u2019s side against his wife.\n\nNTA at all. As someone that doesn\u2019t like the idea of chomping on chunks of fungus either, screw your MIL", "My kid is the same way.  Not a picky eater at all.  ER's a wide variety of vegetables and different combos of food and spices .  She has a few ingredients she doesn't love .  Mushrooms being one .  She doesn't have to eat them!!!  I don't like several foods.  Nobody makes me eat them .  You are allowed to not eat some stuff .  It's a human privilege", "This is tough love, your MIL needs to get over her irrational dislike of living in other places. Good for you for helping her!!!!\n\nNTA OP and great job looking out for your kid!", "I am certain there is something that dear MIL does not care for. Perhaps realllly spicy Indian curry? Korean kimchi? Be sure to have a lovely meal on hand for the next few shared meals and tell her to get over herself. NTA", "NTA. It's ONE item of food. Count it. ONE. MIL is a cruel and vindictive person for punishing your daughter for not conforming to MIL's idea of what is right in the world. That's not tough love. It's bullying and you are completely right to call her out on it.", "I don't like shrimp, eggs, or raw tomatoes for the same reasons you daughter doesn't like mushrooms. I'm 38. I make my kids eggs. I give my dog eggs. I cook with tomatoes, but they are never served raw in my home. I never make shrimp. I absolutely refuse to eat these things. Your daughter will definitely survive not liking mushrooms. \n\nNTA. MIL is definitely TA and I would definitely reconsider your arrangement.", "NTA. Honestly if you're feeling petty you could have people round for dinner and serve food that you know they are avoiding (avoid allergies and intolerences of course). But if grown ass adults sit there and complain or don't eat the food you can then ask if they won't eat the food, how is it they think its okay to force a child to eat a food they hate.\n\nForcing her to eat a food she clearly hates is going to mess with food trust (probably already has thanks to grandma forcing hunger over it) and could lead to other aversions if mushroom is snuck in anywhere (another likely tactic). When haterid of food branches into smell, taste and texture its best to only add it if 1) the person eating it wants to get over their aversion 2) Its done in an agreed upon way (ie hidden if the person wants to try it that way, or cooked but seperated out from the rest of the dish, etc) not because there is nothing else to eat.", "NTA. It\u2019s one vegetable she refuses to eat. It\u2019s not an entire food group. Your mil is controlling and more childish than the 10 year old.", "Nta.  There is no reason for this.  Your mil is a sadist, and I wouldn't trust her with your kid.", "She's clearly a shitty house guest in general because the SILs don't want her either lol", "you are being far too easy on mil: to tell the parents you're feeding their child but secretly only prepare food with mushrooms is nothing short of sadistic. She does not feel she's broadening the poor girl's choices or she would have told the parents her (cruel) plan. Even someone like me who likes mushrooms doesn't want a mushroom every damned meal. \nI would ask my daughter if she ever wanted to see mil again- and go with it. Starving a child into submitting to your will is twisted.", "I hope the next time they have any sort of potluck or host dinner they only make dishes that MIL hates.", "Sounds like she understands perfectly because she only did this torture routine when the parents weren't there.   \nShe was on some weird power kick, the poor hungry 10 year old :(  \n\n\nNTA OP but never let your MIL alone with your daughter again, she's unhinged.", "MIL is showing her ass by only cooking these dishes when OP and her husband aren't home. She knows they would be pissed off if they saw her doing this. \n\nThe thing that boggles my mind is like...it's mushrooms. They're one of the easiest ingredients to avoid. Daughter could avoid mushrooms like the plague for the rest of her life and most people wouldn't even notice she was doing it. \n\nTo be clear, MIL would still be TA if it was a more common ingredient. Bullying a child to try and change their tastes in food is unacceptable. Going against the parents' rules is unacceptable OP is absolutely NTA, and is right to boot MIL out of the house.", "It's not only that even though I agree with the points you made, it's borderline sadistic to starve her granddaughter and cook pretty elaborate dishes with the one ingredient that she dislikes. I wouldn't let that woman spend time alone with my child EVER. NTA", "I was a believer in that rule too until my kid puked mushroom on the kitchen table after her \"just one bite.\"  I don't force the issue anymore", "My brother is on a weird crusade with m3 because I don't like olives. I'm childish because I won't force myself to eat them apparently. He gets rather out of his pram about it, so there are adults who are irrational with other adults too.", "Fortunately, OP's husband is on her side. It's nice to see.", "This! I think SILs are pissed she is now their problem.", "TBH, I'm wondering if the SILs are blowing things up because MIL completely misrepresented to them what happened. \"I was taking care of Susie for them so often, but they just got unjustifiably upset that Susie was starting to cling to me when they were never around!\" or even a very modified version of the truth like \"I was cooking healthy meals for Susie, trying my best, then they both happen to be home, she complains about my cooking out of the blue, and they kick me out!\"", "It's one of those phrases alongside \"brutally honest\" that is mostly alright by itself, but throws up a lot of potential red flags when someone uses it to describe themselves or their actions.", "Literally every single person has at least 1 thing they don't care for. Its perfectly healthy and normal. I'd invite her over jjst to serve her the 1 thing she doesn't like for dinner and see how she reacts. Tell her to grow up if dhe gets mad about it.", "Even if the kid is a picky eater, it's not MIL's business to do something like this. Period.", "Same, had to sit at the table until i ate everything on the plate. I\u2019ll never eat canned asparagus again", "Then she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to watch the daughter. They are both doctors and their schedules aren\u2019t reliable.", "When I was a kid, my friend's parents had 'Option B'. If you didn't like what was made for dinner, you weren't allowed to say things like, \"Ew! Disgusting!\" or \"I'm not eating that!\" All you had to say was, \"Option B, please!\" which was a sandwich or a can of soup. I always thought that was brilliant.", "It's crazy to me in this day in age how some people still don't get the idea of how tastes and beauty are subjective. Crab legs and oysters are some of my favourite delicacies, and someone else might gag at the idea of eating them. Similar to how I might like a certain kind of dark humor, where someone else might be totally offended by it... how do you solve this conundrum? You consume the things you enjoy, and don't consume the things you don't. Easy.", "I had ice cream for dinner last night. Being an adult rocks. Suck it kids who have to eat broccoli, brussel sprouts or mushrooms.", "It\u2019s weird to me too, if any of my kids have any meal disrupted I\u2019m going to hear about it as soon as I see them. Time for OP to have a serious discussion with their child to see what else went on during \u201cgrandma\u201d time. If she\u2019s this unhinged over mushrooms there\u2019s probably more to the story.", "I had to learn the hard way that my logical assumption that my kids ate because they were with gma all day was not as logical apparently as it seemed.", "I had busy parents. I never once got asked what the babysitter made me for dinner. Never crossed their minds. They were paying people to feed me, I got fed. That\u2019s what mattered.", "I don\u2019t believe that the MIL didn\u2019t understand that what she was doing was wrong.", "Because she doesn't feel safe with her grandmother, and her grandmother ~~is~~ was her only caretaker on a regular basis.\n\nIt's not rocket science. She's afraid of escalating punishments.", "Susie didn\u2019t mention it because her grandmother is SCARY to her and probably told her to keep her mouth shut.", "TBH, they forced me to eat it as a kid, maybe 4yo. One projectile vomit all over front porch put an end to it.", "Same! It's the icky watery gelatinous texture of them. Just no.", "Hy DH and I were watching a cooking show in which the chef referred to them as \"fungus\" instead of \"mushrooms\".  That *is* accurate, but after 20min of hearing him make his dish with fungus (e.g., \"Now add the fungus\") we were both put off mushrooms for a quite a while!\n\nETA: NTA", "This hurts my mushroom loving heart because mushrooms don\u2019t need to be slimy or spongy! It is only the cooking technique. You\u2019ll get all the flavor (but better) and none of that ridiculous texture if they are cooked properly. You can cut them any way you like them into a hot pan with small amount of oil to coat it. No salt yet! They cook there at least 6-10 mins on medium until browned (you can kind of tell because they release their juices and then that evaporates) then flip and same the other side(s). Once browned, salt and whatever else and it is ambrosia. Slimy? Omg, no (unless they are canned- then it\u2019s not easily avoidable). After this you can add to gravy or whatever and they will never slime or sponge you. \n\nMuch love from a mushroom lover who cannot with the gross textures of anything.", "Not to be hyperbolic but food trauma seems pretty real imo. My mom had the same experience growing up of being forced to sit at the dinner table all night over cream of corn. When I was a kid, it was never in our house, the smell alone could make my mom gag. I didn't even really know what cream of corn was until I moved out in college. \n\nI don't think I missed out on much by not having cream of corn as a kid, I don't particularly like it myself, but the (potentially disordered) eating habits pushed onto kids by \"tough love\" parents become generational diets all too often. In the best cases like mine, grandkids miss out on a food they might have liked, but in worse cases, they learn eating disorders from their parents, grow up having imbalanced diets or nutritional deficits, etc.", "This kind of behavior made me really dislike my grandmother growing up, and I only saw her about 4 times a year.  How awful for this 10 year old to be living under the control of a controlling, abusive woman.", "You\u2019d ask your kid - what did you have for dinner? \n\nIt\u2019s a regular every day question - not one that means you\u2019re checking up on whoever prepared dinner.\n\nThe kid is old enough to have a conversation with. You don\u2019t need a \u201cgo between adult\u201d to communicate with your own child.", "> I don\u2019t believe that the MIL didn\u2019t understand that what she was doing was wrong.\n\nMany people don't believe children's feelings matter. They think it's a regular part of growing up to be put into unpleasant situations and forced to do things you hate simply because an adult said so. They don't think it matters if the kid is upset, or sad, or even hates them - that just means you're doing your job.", "Never allow your mother alone with your child", "I should have scrolled down to find your comment before expressing practically the same sentiment again :)", "I think op would do best with of a weekend sitting with her daughter and making a meal plan for the week they both get to have fun deciding on, for whomever op employs to look after kiddo, it can be a cute chart they decorate and hang on the fridge or something. That way op is involved even if she's at work for meal times and Susie feels like she has some control on it too. The worst thing the Mil has done is trying to take any control over her preferences from her so this would help with giving it back and making her more confident in her own home.", "My hubby and I love Brussels sprouts, but the kids don't care for them. I ask that they eat at least one, and it seems to work as a middle ground. They need veggies. I'm not gonna force them to eat a whole serving. I cooked some broccoli differently the other day and they LOVED it, so maybe I'll do the same with sprouts.", "the brussel sprout one  made me laugh! My mom steamed them when we were kids and I think she overdid it and they were awful. I was open to trying them again as an adult and had them sauteed with garlic and butter, and lo and behold, I love them now!", "ridiculous- and sadistic.", "More than ridiculous, it is outright abusive. Let the child outgrow the dislike of mushrooms on her own. My mother did that to me. Cooked with stuff she liked and because she liked it, expected me to also. When I got older, I just stopped eating food items with her enhancements. She always got mad. Cilantro for instance. It has a harsh, bitter taste to me and ruins everything. Then I read not everybody tastes cilantro the same way. For her it was milder and added more flavor. But not for me.", "I'm the very opposite of a picky eater. I'll try anything and like weird stuff. I don't like mushrooms. I agree with your texture and taste comment. If they're super cooked and hidden in a dish, I'll eat it. But mushrooms are just... weird, even for me. The MIL here sucks. NTA.", "And to deny a child food like that.\n\nMy dad used to always tell us to not fuss over food. You can always eat/make something else if you don\u2019t want what\u2019s prepared. And there\u2019s always bread.", "I ask my little guy to try everything, too, but it\u2019s ok if he doesn\u2019t like it. He\u2019s an oddball for an American kid bc he doesn\u2019t like melted cheese. No Mac n cheese, no grilled cheese sandwiches, no quesadillas, no cheese on pizza until somewhat recently. Good, cold cheeses he\u2019s absolutely on board with. I have to hide the Parmesan. But melty is a NO.  \nBut he loves spinach salad with vinaigrette.   \nHe couldn\u2019t figure out long noodles until last year, so all pasta was shells. It took us forever to find a pasta shape he liked, and then it was only with meaty marinara. Then he started to like creamy pesto pasta. Then he tried my ramen one day and now he\u2019s all about ramen and pho.   \nyou have to just trust kids. It takes time, butthey\u2019ll come around.", "Sure, but it's not unreasonable for it to not come up in conversation for a week or so.", "Maybe she was afraid of getting into more trouble if she admitted to not eating the dinners?", "My assumption is that MIL puts the kid to bed the nights she watched her. \"What'd you have for dinner last night\" wouldn't really be a question on my mind for my kid the next morning. Plus if she wasn't eating, I'd expect the MIL to say something.", "You seriously interrogate your kids about the minutia of their day?\n\nNormally, asking about their dinner is pretty mind numbingly boring. It's one of those \"what are you doing in class\" questions that you ask as a super generic icebreaker because you want to talk to your kid but they don't really want to talk to you.\n\nLike I get what you're saying, that mom would just ask the kid what grandma made her for dinner last night. I'm just saying it's not super weird that it didn't come up for long enough that mom was blindsided. People are acting like it's a sign of neglect that the parents weren't constantly checking on their child when being cared for *by the person who cared for them* and I'm just thinking that... yeah, if grandma was being sneaky and the kid didn't realize she needed to bring it up, I could see it flying under the radar for a week or two.", "She 100% knows she's being cruel. She calls it \"tough love\" but she's entirely aware that it's not just the parents opinion she's going against, but the daughters health and wellbeing too. She is 100% aware she has abused this child, she believes that abuse is justified to make the child conform to her ideal. That is why she is hiding it.\n\nMIL had no intention of revealing it until she had reached the correct result, and she could present the result of her \"care\" and persuade the child to cover up the means. Stop covering for this woman.

Whatever suits your tastes.

There was an intensive effort to breed them to taste better and not have such an awful texture over the last 20 years.
