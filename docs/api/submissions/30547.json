We\u2019re still friends.\n\nMost of my friends treated me with pity and tiptoed around the subject of my injuries because they wanted to spare my feelings. I told them to treat me normally but they didn\u2019t. I found out a couple of them were calling me names behind my back which really hurt. While almost all of them visited the hospital once, I wished they spent more time with me when I was there.\n\nThroughout, the only person who treated me well was Darren\u2019s friend Alex. Alex was a jerk to me before and I half suspected he had a crush on Darren based on the number of times  he said that I was ugly compared to him in front of others. He\u2019s not wrong but it\u2019s a mean thing to say. I thought he would be the worst tormentor to be honest.\n\nAfter I got injured, he was the only person who visited me constantly.

Honestly despite his personality, Alex was a godsend.\n\nMy friends were doing a quick (drunk) game where you have to tell the truth. Darren was there. When I was asked who I liked the most, I answered honestly and said Alex. He is my favorite. \n\nDarren came up to me afterwards and asked if I cheated on him with Alex.

My friends are fighting and several of them urge me to apologize to Darren and say I didn\u2019t mean it when I said Alex was my favorite. I broke the friend group by saying that Alex was my favorite. AITA?\n\nEdit: it was a very busy time for my friends. There was work and grad school and a lot of things had to be juggled.

He broke up with you after you got a scar and he has the audacity to accuse you of cheating? NTA for not tiptoeing around his extremely fragile ego. It\u2019s okay to be friends with someone who\u2019s supporting you during a rough time. Your ex is just trying to blame you for something he\u2019s definitely in the wrong over.", "NTA, and your group seems about a decade too old for this teen drama. Alex stepped up because he wanted to be helpful, and maybe he's got one of those 'healer' personalities that wants to try helping sick folks. Or maybe he developed a crush on you, not on Darren. Darren left, so he gets no say in anything.", "NTA\n\nA person once asked me a question: \"Do you know what happens when you go looking for trouble?\"\n\nThe answer is you find it. Every. Single. Time.\n\nSounds like Darren had some feelings he was keeping to himself and hasn't sorted them out yet. They're ultimately not your responsibility nor should you break your honesty because of it. If they didn't like the answer, they shouldn't have asked.", "NTA. Your friends are jerks. Sounds like Alex was the only one to be there for you throughout a traumatic time when it should have been your bf. If you agree to play the game accept the answer and accept other peoples' truths even if it hurts. They're all children.", "NTA. They say misfortune shows you who your true friends really are -- and it turned out that Alex was. Darren was a not a great boyfriend. It's understandable that things changed for him romantically after the accident (but I, personally, think that if it were true love or a really solid relationship that it could have withstood the accident), but to consider himself still a friend, and that he also hardly showed up for you in your time of need? And your other friends? \n\nIt's not cheating to be appreciative of the friendship you were shown above all of the others when you needed it the most.", "NTA - there\u2019s no reason to apologize at all. Staying friends with ex\u2019s is tough and this sort of thing is why. You can acknowledge his feelings but you don\u2019t owe anybody an apology.", "Darren chose his path.

They just had work and school and other things that took time. Alex had time and energy to stay with me and naturally he would be my favorite.", "I don\u2019t blame Darren for breaking up with me. The scar is very jarring. It\u2019s the first thing people usually notice.", "You said Alex was the only one who treated you well AND that some of them were talking about you behind your back?", "You\u2019re still you, the person he had a crush on for years and dated for one. Surely that wasn\u2019t all because of your looks?", "Pfft honestly your ex is an a hole, Alex seems like a diamond in the rough but don\u2019t mistaken his kindness for interest. \n\nIf you cheated on your ex it absolves him of his guilt for dumping you because he is shallow. It\u2019s pretty simple why he is pushing the idea, to make himself look better in front of everyone. He will never going to be a \u2018in sickness and in health\u2019 type of guy only \u2018in perfection\u2019.\n\nMaybe don\u2019t be so naive either about who these people really are - friendly towards you, yes. Friends of yours, no. They are more worried about the exs feelings because you said someone who was there for you throughout this ordeal is your favourite as opposed to the ex who left you because the scar is too jarring for him to find you attractive anymore (shallow, it\u2019s called being shallow). Again those aren\u2019t friends.", "For me, there\u2019s a gap between well and crappily so while Alex treated me well, I don\u2019t want to be rude and say they did treat me badly. If they didn\u2019t care, they wouldn\u2019t have visited me at all.\n\nA couple of friends did call me a name based on my scar behind my back. It was hurtful but they apologized and I forgave them.", "NTA. Darren left you. Nothing that happened between you and anyone else after that can be considered cheating.   \nUnless, of course, Darren lives in some sort of la-la-land where he can leave you to struggle through recovery but you'd still pine for him and be 'faithful' to him and then swoop back in once you'd done all the hard work on your own, with a pat on the back for getting over his aesthetic discomfort into the bargain.", "NTA - Get better friends.", "NTA\n\nI've never personally understood what's so hard about behaving normally around people that were clearly victims of an accident or that have a disability. Moreover, at least from what you tell, it's 100% clear that apparently Alex was the only or one of the few decent people among your friends. So much so that I'm starting to wonder if your friends are feeling so upset exactly because they also feel how Alex managed to be the most decent one by just behaving normally, while they've made fool of themselves by treating you like you're about to die. Or by outright dumping you for a facial scar. \n\nLast but not least, I 100% agree and confirm you that someone that dumped you over a facial scar (confirming, in turn, that they were with you mainly for your looks) is not entitled to put you on a cross for a paranoia that you cheated *emotionally* on them.", "nta", "NTA\n\nLeave each person to manage their own feelings. The truth is that you appreciate Alex for the support he gave you following your accident. End of story. Whether Alex had his own hidden agenda or a hidden gem of a soul, whether your ex has feelings of guilt or betrayal, whether others care more for ex's feelings than yours... None of that is your concern to manage. They can read more into it or not; that's not in your control.\n\nThey left you to manage your own feelings about how they treated you. And you seem to have done so with kindness, compassion, and forgiveness. They can either do the same or not. Always was and remains their choice.", "NTA losing interest because of a scar says a lot about darren tho", "Why the person who was there for you at your lowest wouldn't be your favorite? \nYour answer was the right one, their anger is misplaced guilt because they were not there for you and treated you badly.\nNTA by any stretch of the imagination.", "You seem like a very kind person.", "I think I would just keep repeating that. Because he was good to you when you were in hospital, he\u2019s your favourite. Doesn\u2019t reflect on anyone else, just reflects your appreciation.\n\nNTA at all but those friends who called you names are horrific AHs and Darren is probably making an extra fuss over guilt.", "The people who called you a name are very lucky you forgave them, their behaviour was horrific, and they do not deserve to be making a fuss now. They\u2019ve already been granted more grace than they deserved.", "How is it rude to say \u201csomeone treated me badly\u201d when they did just that? Shit talking you and calling you names is treating you badly. Point blank period. It may not be the *worst* treatment you can receive, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are not treating you badly."]}
