Kids are when asked very willing to follow rules and the are respectfull for your stuff now. \n\nOn my point of view its a win-win situtation for you and the kids. So there is no need to change your rules.\n\nYou are very kind with helping your GF with a good solution, this is giving a win-win situation aswell.\n\nCongratulation!", "NTA.  You have the right to keep your stuff clean.  And it is nice of you to help her out with a rental.  If you are planning on this being a long term thing you may need to bend a little.  Moms, in general, like to be with men who don't see their kids as a problem.", "Nta for wanting your car kept clean, but you need to think is a relationship with someone that has kids really what you're after?", "NTA. I mean, unless it\u2019s a 5-hour trip to trade custody, the kids can go without snacking for the trip to dad\u2019s. I think a lot of parents use snacks to keep their kids quiet in the car, unfortunately. Not that you have to do this, but if you were willing to pay for a car service, wouldn\u2019t that money help more to supplement her car purchase?\n\nThis reminds me of a story on an old etiquette website about a woman who had a fancy sports car. Her coworker was having car trouble and asked if the woman would drive her to and from work for a week or two. She said yes. First morning the coworker comes out with her child and a carseat. \u201cWe just have to drop junior off at daycare.\u201d Woman refused because she didn\u2019t want her expensive leather seats marred by the car seat. She wasn\u2019t even sure there was enough room for the carseat in the back. And coworker blew up at her, even though she never thought to mention the need to drop junior off at daycare. Perfect example of giving an inch and them trying to take a mile.", "NTA. You set reasonable rules (my dad didn\u2019t let us eat in the car unless it was a long trip for similar reasons, albeit he had cloth seats) and she broke them. You aren\u2019t leaving her out to dry (though her kids aren\u2019t your responsibility).", "NTA\n\nYou let her use your car with set rules. She broke those rules. End of story. Maybe if she had an ounce of respect for you then she wouldn't be in the situation she's in. Not to mention that with a job, alimony, and child support..... she should be able to find herself a car. \n\nIt's not \"controlling\" when a person doesn't let someone borrow their car. Especially when said person is letting people eat in the car when the owner said not to. You're also paying for a ride share.... She should be thanking you.", "This is why I feel like I\u2019ll never be able to get married. Everyone on here says \u201cdon\u2019t tell people to break up over little things\u201d and OP, you clearly say you\u2019re happy otherwise, but\u2026.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I could ever look at someone the same again who called me a \u201ccontrolling jackass\u201d about something I bought and let them use after they blatantly disregarded the conditions under which it was given. \u201cControlling\u201d would be withholding the car to prevent her from going somewhere, not PAYING for an alternative service instead. \n\nAnd \u201cno food in the car\u201d is an EXTREMELY common rule, and EXTREMELY easy to follow. Not only did they eat in it, they *left food in it.* Which demonstrates why the rule exists. I know people are flawed, but I just couldn\u2019t share my life with another adult who behaved like an entitled teenager when called out.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be with someone who had such a lack of respect for me and such a total sense of entitlement, even in the one instance. Especially if they don\u2019t acknowledge or apologize for it.", "She is a really good mom.  She works hard and provides a great life for her kids.  She isn't blowing all her money on herself or anything.

Sheesh.", "Let's also talk about about the gf tried to pull this bullshit of making OP feel like he was in the wrong when she quite literally took a heaping hot shit on his rule of not allowing the kid to eat in the car. I mean.... Tell me you don't respect your SO without actually telling me you don't respect your SO.", "I am not saying she is a bad mom, OP. But if she works hard, gets alimony and child support, and still you are the one who is being kind enough to chauffer her around and pay for the car service, she could do the bare minimum and stick to a simple rule set in place. Stick to it, its a very reasonable request.", "Seriously.  When my sister and I were little, neither of my parents let us eat in their car unless it was a) unavoidable and b) something chosen deliberately to be easy to clean up if spilled.  If anything, I remember my mom being more strict about it.", "IMO, she should be able to find herself a car given that she works hard, gets alimony, and also gets child support.", "NTA. You've dated this woman for a year now and she managed to let you pay the car service she's using now. And the fact that she receives child support and alimony from her ex.

So he did not allow her to exploit him and set some boundaries, just like you do?", "NTA. \n\nYou set a clear rule and she broke it. The fact that she isn\u2019t even apologetic goes to show you shouldn\u2019t go back on your decision. You providing another means on transportation for her is generous enough and she should be thankful.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to not feed kids in a car", "NTA. Your boundary was that your car be kept clean when transporting her children and you put up with it several times when it was unclean. You were even nice enough to sign her up for a car share with your money and also give her advance warning of the consequences if you get invoiced a cleaning fee. The rules were very clear and this is about your vehicle and how you want it respected. \n\nIt's also only been a year and she seems extremely entitled. I personally wouldn't date someone who instead of being mortified of how her kids made messes several times, makes it about how you're an AH. It sounds like she thinks everyone else is the problem but can't be accountable to you and doesn't think your very easy requests matter. Even if her kids did make a mess, I have a hunch that you'd be ok with her still using the car if she paid to have it cleaned weekly and be super appreciative of you letting her use your car. \n\nAlso, it's her ex baggage and that's on her to work through it in therapy or some other way. She doesn't get to make it seem like you're like her ex. You're not controlling her with money; you're controlling access to YOUR vehicle that YOU own and that you've only been dating a year so who the F does she think she is?", "I don\u2019t know man. Her husband escaped and here you are signing up to cater to her single mom with two kids thinking she\u2019s a princess. Is she the last woman on earth to date? Good luck bro", "NTA This is not controlling, this is a boundary. She likely struggles to see the difference due to the past trauma you mentioned in your edit, but that does not excuse her behavior. You would be controlling if you said no food in HER car, but since it\u2019s YOUR car you have the right to that rule and she needs to follow it or not use the car.", "If you make an agreement, you have to honor it.\n\nYour GF made the agreement with no intention of honoring it. It was just words to her, magic words to get what she wanted from you.\n\nShe's the AH.", "NTA", "NTA.  It is entirely  reasonable to request to ask for no eating in the car.  This r/ChoosingBeggars can get her own car and make it as dirty as she feels entitled.\n\nYou've even provided a service for her to get around. That's apparently not good enough for her-she wants to use your car and disregard your request for its use.  She's the controlling one here.", "NTA she asked to borrow your car. She didn't return it in the condition it was lent. You rescinded your offer to let her borrow it anymore. That isnt controlling. Remember you are only hearing one side of a story. It might not be her ex was controlling, but that she was a demanding boundary stomper.", "Apparently saying I'm sorry is very hard  some people. NTA.", "NTA. It's your car and you have every right to have this boundary - it's not unreasonable or outrageous, and NOT controlling. You did not cut her off from transportation altogether - you generously made other arrangements for her. There is no NEED for anyone to eat in a car - that is a WANT, and a habit that has just become so common that no one thinks twice about until they encounter a person or rule that restricts it.", "NTA I would seriously consider this relationship though. She called you a controlling jackass, knowing it was a direct comparison to her abusive ex. That's an extremely manipulative thing to do and I'd consider it a red flag.\n\nYou asked for a perfectly reasonable condition for your property. A rule that is very common. She deliberately ignored it even though it on no way inconvenienced her. Then when you took away the car because she broke her side of the agreement, she immediately went to manipulating you and being hurtful.", "NTA. Your car your rules.  Firsthand experience don't loan a car. That comes from it being wrecked. No food or drink is a lost cause. I didn't want to hear the kid complaining while driving it.", "NTA you are allowed to be controlling about the car and not want food in it lol, it doesn't make you a jackass. she should be happy that you are helping her out with the car service, groceries, and other errands. you are sure she's not using you right? i may be out of line but maybe she should be a better parent and put in the effort to feed them at home before the custody switch, instead of fast food on the way there.", "NTA. Learning to respect other people\u2019s property is not controlling", "NTA but I think there is a bigger problem here than the car, it is your gf not respecting your reasonable request.", "I am.", "No, he would not let her work, and only allowed her a small amount of money to spend on herself.  And he fought the divorce like an asshole to put her in debt.", "We like each other well enough.  Who knows where it will go.  And I don't know what you mean by treating her like a princess.", "I'm waiting to see her later today to talk about it.", "OP shouldn\u2019t have paid for the ride-share service either.

This so-called partner isn\u2019t relationship material. I get that it\u2019s a \u201clittle thing\u201d but it\u2019s indicative of so much.

This is not what it looks like.  NTA.", "I think it's more about car's value, not just upholstery. OP said vehicle could be sold for the same price he bought it.  If \"food in a car\" continues he would have to lower a price because of ruined inside.", "[removed]", "My grandmother had cloth car seats and the rule in her car was no food and drink. My parents' car had vinyl seats and we were allowed food and drink only on long drives. Easy to clean didn't mean they wanted to be cleaning the car interior daily.\n\nI still think that for most car rides kids don't need to be eating, most are short enough that kids can eat or drink after without getting too hungry. I let kids have water in my car any time but unless we're on a really tight schedule and literally the only time they get to eat is in the car, they don't need to be eating in cars.", "Copied partial comment", "Meh.

I have to buy a car this year and if I hadn't been scripting and saving for the past couple years I couldn't afford one.", "Yeah, the times there were exceptions to the \u201cno food in car\u201d rule when I was a kid tended to involve 4+ hour drives.  When we were older and more responsible, the rule loosened, but there were some false starts.  I remember an incident with a chocolate cake (I think maybe one of those single serve ones Carl\u2019s Jr. made back then? Definitely about that size)\u2026boy did my dad lose it.", "Hold on.

Maybe your girlfriend's ex wasn't as unreasonably controlling as she says.", "NTA and no one is an AH for not lending their car, regardless of reasons. It can lead to too many problems, especially if they are in an accident in your car, and possibly if they get pulled over for any reason. I know eating in the car is a far cry from wrecking the car, but if you don\u2019t want crumbs and messes in it, that\u2019s 100% your prerogative, and understandable. Kids manage to get food in places you\u2019d never think you\u2019d find food.", "NTA. She\u2019s damaging the resale value of an asset, and something you use and like to have clean\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to not eat in someone else\u2019s car.

But here is the thing, its yours. You are allowed to control what happens in it, and who gets to drive it. That is the way things works. You own something, you get to set rules for how it is used. \n\nYou set clear rules, and she broke them. So you stopped letting her use your car. And you were nice enough to provide a solution, when you did not have to. \n\nYour GF is the AH here for breaking the agreed upon rules of your car, then complaining about the consequences. \n\nNTA", "NTA. also you\u2019re a good guy and i think the way you want to have an adult conversation with your girlfriend about this (instead of dumping her and dusting your hands off like many of the comments are not-so-subtly suggesting) is honorable. do be aware of red flags that might come up because of this, but otherwise you\u2019re being reasonable and you know your girlfriend better than we do.", "Nta \n\nJust wondering, are you german?", "NTA. Keeping your car clean is not being controlling. You\u2019re actually going above and beyond by still providing her with a way to get around. It\u2019s not even your responsibility. I would think she\u2019d be appreciative of your kindness instead of calling you names.", "NTA. My boyfriends car is from 2017 and much nicer than my 2006 car. He has always had the rule of no eating in the car, even for us adults and we have always respected it. If we order food we just keep it in the bag until we get home. We have a 1.5 yo and I have a 10 yo together and it's not hard for the older kid to respect as well. You can definitely tell my car is the one we eat it as it's much messier and my boyfriends is nice and clean, lol.", "NTA - If she wants to borrow your car, she needs to treat it better than she treats her own belongings. This is literally something my dad taught me as a child.

I hate the smell of food in small, enclosed spaces. I\u2019m happy to stop at a restaurant or a safe place along the highways on road trips so that my family can enjoy their meal. But I draw the line at eating in the car. Nope\u2026", "NTA. its a simple request, kids can wait 5 minutes until they get to their destination for a snack", "NTA. I have the same rule in my car.", "NTA", "Nta. It's not a big request. She is abusing your trust.", "NTA. Your gf doesn\u2019t respect you. Dating people with kids often means they expect you to compromise your boundaries for them. Dump her.", "NTA.  You can be a controlling jackass about your car, it's YOUR car.

She didn't respect this one.", "NTA She is a liar and doesn't take care of the things she borrows. She can have a stinky car when she gets the money to buy one, you don't need to volunteer yours for the malodorous downgrade. How freaking hard is it not to let kids eat for 20 minutes?", "NTA", "NTA. You're doing her a favor. The least she can do is respect your wishes/property.", "NTA. No one knows how to respect things they didn't pay for.  My ex trashed my brand new car. I bought him a car cause i was tired of him using mine. He trashed that too. Never again lol. Don't let anyone fuck up what you worked hard for.", "NTA\n\nI have been married for 30 years. In 2012 my wife and I went out and bought her the first brand new car she has ever owned.\n\nShe loves that car. Until recently it still had a faint new car smell when you got into it. No eating is allowed. No drinks, nothing. That car is 11 years old and looks like it just rolled off the lot.\n\nHer car, her rules.\n\nI can't imagine borrowing her car and blatantly ignoring her asking that I not eat or drink in it. She would be well within her rights to ban me from ever driving it again.\n\nJust as you are well within your rights to ban your girlfriend from driving yours. The fact that she is trying to gaslight you into thinking you are controlling because she decided to ignore your request is telling.", "No respect no car. Simple.", "NTA, you're completely in your rights to be upset - but maybe rethink this one. \n\n2 years from now, when its serious and those kiddos spend half their time with you, how would you feel about them making a mess in your house, room, etc?\n\nBecause she's a package deal, and her baggage aside from her ex, those kids are part of her life forever.", "NTA. You made a very reasonable request. Stick to it. My kids weren't allowed to eat in my car except long trips but they were in my husband's. Guess which car slowly got trashed over time. Your car, your rules.", "NTA\u2026\nBe careful about who you let drive your car though. If y\u2019all don\u2019t co-mingle your finances, I\u2019d be wary on letting her or anyone drove my car. It\u2019s a liability thing. She gets in one at-fault accident and hurts someone, it\u2019s you that will suffer the most financially.  Hopefully you have higher than state minimums for liability, but one trip by ambulance to the hospital is gonna cost you a lot. You\u2019re the one who has assets, like a house. Even if you weren\u2019t the driver, a good lawyer will go after the car owner- especially if they have lots of assets. I\u2019m an insurance agent, I see this all the time.  Moral of the story: if you let anyone else drive your car, be sure to have high limits of liability.  Just my 2 cents! \n\nAlso, she should not have let her kids eat in your car. That was the condition. She didn\u2019t meet it. You\u2019re not controlling at all.  And how awesome of you to find a car sharing service!", "NTA. You are allowed to set reasonable boundaries regarding the use of your property, asking that people respect your property and treat it as you yourself treat it is a reasonable request.

New car, even used, too expensive. Your car, free but don't make a mess. She makes a mess. You say fine, here's a rideshare, but if that falls through I'm done.\n\nAnd **then** you were called controlling. \n\nWhy isn't she paying for the ride share?

Why does she expect you to provide transportation?\n\nNTA", "Yes, she might have had a bad relationship. Been there, living through it. But the key is communication, which you did. You told her not to let the kids eat in YOUR car that YOU paid for (it doesn't matter if you keep it pristine or a mess, it's yours and you paid for it) and she agreed. Her now being upset for the consequences of her actions is ridiculous. Her ex might have been controlling, but you communicated. And now you're communicating your opinions and feelings about it. She might be adjusting to life without her ex and it's important to work with her, but definitely not at the expense of yourself. In this case, you did nothing wrong and she (along with so many others) needs to gets used to consequences of their actions. NTA", "NTA. Completely reasonable.  But her attitude will never change. You don't want to be labeled controlling. She's a steam roller. She's going to label you when ever she doesn't get her way. You should think about that.", "NTA.

My mum has had the no food or non water drinks in the car rule all my life, I have never once broken it because it\u2019s HER car", "NTA.

She is very disrespectful for allowing this to happen.  NTA.", "NTA.  You're not being a controlling jackass with YOUR car - she's being a total AH.  It is a simple and reasonable request and it's telling that she simply can't/won't manage it and pushes back on you.

It's not your responsibility", "NTA, but I think you need to reevaluate if this relationship is something you want. You\u2019ve been seeing her for a year already. Do you want it to be longer term or forever? Kids can be filthy. Even without eating in my car, I feel like I\u2019m getting it detailed every few months because of my children.

It\u2019s not like you said no music or talking or something unreasonable like that.\n\nAnd you went as far as to provide an alternative ride source, you didn\u2019t just cut her off.\n\nYou\u2019re trying to control her life. But you do get to say how you car gets used when she borrows it, and \u201cno eating i. the car\u201d is a perfectly reasonable position.\n\nAnd anyway, eating in the car is one of the worst habits people can develop.", "NTA and this is not the woman with kids you want a long term relationship with. She\u2019s on alimony which sounds like she didn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t work. So, you will be expected to pay for everything if that\u2019s true. Hell, she already feels entitled to YOUR car and you don\u2019t even live together. Just cut your losses.", "Def NTA but you should be more considerate.\n\nYou are dating someone with kids. I get its a new car but I think its a little crazy to have that position. You did a good thing with the ride share but instead of saying you'd cancel it, maybe say she'd have to pay the clearing fee.

They're not controlling when it is their property at all.", "NTA  \n\n\nNot eating in a new car is a fair rule.   \nEven if you do, as you are an adult.   \n\n\nSounds like she's a good mom and the kids are generally good.

We all have things that are dealbreakers and things that are not. Finding the right person is kind of finding someone who's faults you can live with and who doesn't break your deal breakers.

Of course, I did eventually meet the man who I ended up marrying...but that was because I found someone who *enhanced* my life. I was no longer willing to waste my solitude on someone who didn't make my life better. It's not about demanding anything from someone. It's not about being inflexible.
