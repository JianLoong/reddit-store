It isn't anything fancy but it is the most expensive thing I've ever purchased besides my home.  \n\nTwo months ago my girlfriend's car gave up the ghost.  She cannot find a car that she both likes and is in her price range.  Even used cars are going for insane prices.  My car has 24,000 miles on it and I could probably get what I paid for it if I sold it.  \n\nI have been helping her out by taking her for groceries and other errands.  \n\nA few times now she has asked if she could borrow my car to trade custody of the kids.  I agreed and asked her to please not let her kids eat in my car.  \n\nI'm very particular about my car. For example it has heated and vented leather seats.  I don't want a drink spilled on them.  I don't want sticky fingerprints on my stuff.  \n\nShe agreed to my request but didn't follow through.  I found food in the car.  There was other evidence that my request had not been followed.  \n\nSo I told her that I couldn't lend her my car any more.  I signed her up for a car share service that I pay for that she can use to shuttle the kids around. I made sure she knew that if I got a cleaning charge after she used it I would cancel it.     \n\nShe says I'm being a controlling jackass about my car.  I don't think I am. I don't go to her home and leave a mess.  I don't think it's weird to want to have nice things remain nice.  \n\nHer kids are mostly well behaved and we get along.

It's your car. You agreed to lend it to her under specific conditions which are not particularly unreasonable. I think even people who aren't particularly precious about their car would find it irritating to get it back with food bits and mess in it. Offering to pay for a carshare is very generous of you. \n\nAlso, if she was desperate for a car and really needed it... she would not be so picky. She would get something within her budget, that she likes less but affords her independence and that she can mess all she wants.", "NTA it\u2019s easy to not allow food in a car when transporting children on a few one off occasions. She\u2019s being entitled and demanding.", "NTA You said you didn\u2019t want food in the car and guessing how the you can easily make a mess and let it stay permanently your gf didn\u2019t abide your rules with your car. it\u2019s her responsibility to make her the kids not eat in your car or her to eat in your car.", "NTA.

You take her to buy groceries and lended your car and made a simple request that could have easily been followed through. You are being too nice and I just wish you would be careful so that she doesn't take advantage of your good nature.", "NTA.

You're even paying for a car share service as a reasonable alternative. Stand your ground, you did the right thing.", "NTA they gave her a simple rule she ignored it and didn't seem to even attempt to clean up the kids mess before giving the car back", "Nta.

Kids are when asked very willing to follow rules and the are respectfull for your stuff now. \n\nOn my point of view its a win-win situtation for you and the kids. So there is no need to change your rules.\n\nYou are very kind with helping your GF with a good solution, this is giving a win-win situation aswell.\n\nCongratulation!", "NTA.  You have the right to keep your stuff clean.  And it is nice of you to help her out with a rental.  If you are planning on this being a long term thing you may need to bend a little.  Moms, in general, like to be with men who don't see their kids as a problem.", "Nta for wanting your car kept clean, but you need to think is a relationship with someone that has kids really what you're after?", "NTA. I mean, unless it\u2019s a 5-hour trip to trade custody, the kids can go without snacking for the trip to dad\u2019s. I think a lot of parents use snacks to keep their kids quiet in the car, unfortunately. Not that you have to do this, but if you were willing to pay for a car service, wouldn\u2019t that money help more to supplement her car purchase?\n\nThis reminds me of a story on an old etiquette website about a woman who had a fancy sports car. Her coworker was having car trouble and asked if the woman would drive her to and from work for a week or two. She said yes. First morning the coworker comes out with her child and a carseat. \u201cWe just have to drop junior off at daycare.\u201d Woman refused because she didn\u2019t want her expensive leather seats marred by the car seat. She wasn\u2019t even sure there was enough room for the carseat in the back. And coworker blew up at her, even though she never thought to mention the need to drop junior off at daycare. Perfect example of giving an inch and them trying to take a mile.", "NTA. You set reasonable rules (my dad didn\u2019t let us eat in the car unless it was a long trip for similar reasons, albeit he had cloth seats) and she broke them. You aren\u2019t leaving her out to dry (though her kids aren\u2019t your responsibility).", "NTA\n\nYou let her use your car with set rules. She broke those rules. End of story. Maybe if she had an ounce of respect for you then she wouldn't be in the situation she's in. Not to mention that with a job, alimony, and child support..... she should be able to find herself a car. \n\nIt's not \"controlling\" when a person doesn't let someone borrow their car. Especially when said person is letting people eat in the car when the owner said not to. You're also paying for a ride share.... She should be thanking you.", "This is why I feel like I\u2019ll never be able to get married. Everyone on here says \u201cdon\u2019t tell people to break up over little things\u201d and OP, you clearly say you\u2019re happy otherwise, but\u2026.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I could ever look at someone the same again who called me a \u201ccontrolling jackass\u201d about something I bought and let them use after they blatantly disregarded the conditions under which it was given. \u201cControlling\u201d would be withholding the car to prevent her from going somewhere, not PAYING for an alternative service instead. \n\nAnd \u201cno food in the car\u201d is an EXTREMELY common rule, and EXTREMELY easy to follow. Not only did they eat in it, they *left food in it.* Which demonstrates why the rule exists. I know people are flawed, but I just couldn\u2019t share my life with another adult who behaved like an entitled teenager when called out.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be with someone who had such a lack of respect for me and such a total sense of entitlement, even in the one instance. Especially if they don\u2019t acknowledge or apologize for it.", "She is a really good mom.  She works hard and provides a great life for her kids.  She isn't blowing all her money on herself or anything.  I can afford it and it costs a lot less than getting my car detailed.", "Putting my pedant's hat on, it's hundreds or low thousands worth of upholstery. The kids aren't eating in the engine, I hope.", "NTA at all.\n\nIt's not the kids who are the problem; it's the mom ignoring the simple rule of 'no eating food in the car.' Sheesh.", "Let's also talk about about the gf tried to pull this bullshit of making OP feel like he was in the wrong when she quite literally took a heaping hot shit on his rule of not allowing the kid to eat in the car. I mean.... Tell me you don't respect your SO without actually telling me you don't respect your SO.", "I am not saying she is a bad mom, OP. But if she works hard, gets alimony and child support, and still you are the one who is being kind enough to chauffer her around and pay for the car service, she could do the bare minimum and stick to a simple rule set in place. Stick to it, its a very reasonable request.", "Seriously.  When my sister and I were little, neither of my parents let us eat in their car unless it was a) unavoidable and b) something chosen deliberately to be easy to clean up if spilled.  If anything, I remember my mom being more strict about it.", "IMO, she should be able to find herself a car given that she works hard, gets alimony, and also gets child support."]}
