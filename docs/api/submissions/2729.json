He was at work, I was in the hospital with my mom, she has dementia and had 1 stroke at the time.

I was there for 2.5 hours when I got the call they tried to give her an MRI. She can't have MRI bc she has metal in her back. The MRI would have ripped it right out of her back, it would've killed her. I leave work, rush home to get an overnight bag, to stay the night with her and make medical decisions. While home, I took the PS5 from the living room, took my stepsons personal laptop (he has 1 for play & 1 specifically from the school to do school work only) & I took his fire stick so he didn't have anything to watch on TV. I head back to the hospital to be with my mom. 20 minutes into being back with her she has her second stroke. At the very same time my boyfriend texts me complaining that I unplugged the PlayStation and he had to recover all of his saved games, and it was a long stressful process. He sent my pictures of the whole process, mad. He said he understood why I unplugged it, but not to do it again bc he was scared he couldn't recover his saved games. I'm stressed to the max trying to keep my composure for my mom, and for my child to make sure I don't put myself into early labor, and he's throwing a fit over a PlayStation. I told him that was completely uncalled for, he could have waited to say that to me later, especially without the guilt of pictures. My mom was currently having a stroke and I wish my biggest worry was a PlayStation, that he should be more considerate of what's happening around him before he makes a big deal over something that wasn't. I told him to leave me alone while I deal with real issues and to never come to me about how to parent his child ever again. If his son wants to be lazy and fail out of highschool for videogames while he (his father) does nothing realistic about it, so be it. Not my child, not my problem.
