Take time to think about whether this is a man you want to raise a child with. Not only did he rant about his games, it sounds like he never asked about how your mom and you are doing. Plus he doesn\u2019t have a realistic plan for doing anything about his son\u2019s behavior. This is the kind of non-support you will get from him. If he hasn\u2019t learned proper parenting in 16 years, he won\u2019t now.", "YTA just for the title.", "NTA but sorry to tell you but you're gonna be dealing with 3 kids...", "NTA but sorry to tell you but you're gonna be dealing with 3 kids...", "NTA\n\nUnless you shut the machine down WHILE it was saving (something that happens in a space of less the 5 seconds) it cannot loose a save file. You just shut it down while it's in rest mode and it's checking for save file integrity as it doesn't know when it was shut down abruptly. This is normal.\n\nYour partner on the other hand is TA", "OP=NTA\n\nBut is this what you want to marry? and co-parent with? OYE", "Why are you worried about this kid with all the other things you have on your plate? Focus on your baby, your mom and your health. Boyfriend and his spawn will have to deal with the lack of structure when spawn is in his mid-20s or so.", "YTA.  Your stepson is not responsible for your mother's dementia, he is not responsible for your pregnancy, he is not responsible for your work situation, yet you are \"stressed\" from all of that, and he's supposed to make your life easier by not stressing you out while he plays a video game.    \n\n\nDid it ever occur to you that your pregnancy \"stresses\" him, that the resources your mother's dementia and other medical complications take from the family \"stresses\"him, and that his father having to accommodate all of your stresses \"stresses\" your stepson?  \n\n\nHonestly your household as you describe it sounds like a real s**tshow, and you want him to be the adult.  \n\nIf he's passing his classes and the only trouble he is \"causing\" is playing video games, you are lucky, because you are not affording him the courtesy of a well-ordered and loving home. I can only imagine how awful you will be once the baby is born.", "NTA,  just wow, and I just set up my first account on our sony the other day, we are newly empty nester and got netflix so I had to set it up, annoying yes but wort getting mad yikes, and I'm a wife of a husband who's sons left call of duty running on our ps3 and got the red light of death, he googled how to fix and had to put the guts in the oven and reset the hardware in the mother board, and even that much hassle isn't worth yelling and berating your pregnant wife dealing with real issues. Insanity I feel for her and hope the stress do put her in early labor, fingers crossed husband gets his head out of his ass and be there for her.", "And You and your baby and your mother should all be more important than a game console!", "He said he knew I would take offense to the pictures and was just trying to show me the stressful process he had to go thru. I told him he sent those to guilt me and could've saved for a better time. He said he'd leave me alone to deal with my mother since he made me upset.", "We agreed on a parenting decision together.\nMy boyfriend is the one who threw a fit over a game system.\nWe agreed to take the whole system away from him.\nIt being unplugged didn't become an issue until he had to take 10 minutes of his life to reboot it. \nHe didn't lose any saved games, data, whatever.\nBut yet he's mad at me over it, and not the fact it had to be taken away to teach his son a lesson in the first place.\nI'm not going to get belittled over a decision we made together about HIS child. \nIf he didn't like what WE agreed upon, he can figure out the proper course of action for his son and leave me out of it.\nI will not go thru that again, just for it to turn around on me.\nIf that makes me an asshole, I'll be the asshole.", "Hilarious", "Later found out he didn't lose anything, the back up storage was just rebooting. The PlayStation is fine. So he really didn't need to say anything to me at all. He wanted to whether it was guilt or insight, it just wasn't the correct time to.", "Honestly OP I almost think you are TA for marrying and having a child with this man. \n\nYou deserve so much better than this.", "Pretty much. While packing my overnight bag, he asked me to unplug it. Then it's an issue dawn the road he could've saved for another day. \n\nI asked if I was the asshole or not, so I'm not really bothered by the people who think I am. I'm giving my time to explain to those who seem like they could comprehend my side. Tbh for those who think I am an asshole, that's cool, I can totally be one. I tried to offer the best I could under the circumstances. If they can't see why it was inappropriate to bring up the play station at the time he did instead of saving it for a better time, they're just as delusional as him.", "I am so sorry you\u2019ve had to explain this 90 times.", "Honey, who cares?  Who cares if every single thing he ever played went poof?  You're nine fucking months pregnant dealing with your mother in critical condition.  And all he cares about are his video games.  Is this a man you want to raise a child with?  Look how he behaves with his first kid.  Do you have any sort of support sytem, because he ain't one.  Friends, other family?  If so, call them.  If not, look into getting a doula for your birth because I can only imagine how useless this guy is going to be.", "God i hope you broke up with him", "Sounds like we can trace where stepson's gaming dependence stems from!\n\nAlso one only just started reading the comments but based on OP's edit, whoever is saying metal and MRIs is fine is too lazy to do a 10 second google and I hope they're never in charge of anyone else's medical decisions because yikes.", "NTA", "NTA but tell your husband his son his problem\nThat kid 16 and can't do homework", "I\u2019m sorry you have too much on your plate. I hope everything will turn out ok. Focus on your mom and your baby first, if possible.", "NTA your BF is a self-absorbed jerk I wouldn\u2019t leave in charge of an infant", "NTA. I'm sorry for all you are dealing with. That makes your eloquence to your BF even more impressive. You said it perfectly. Focus on you, your mom, and your baby. Let everyone else take care of themselves. Let your close friends/family know what support you need (beyond asking your BF to not harass you with his Playstation woes). Let the helpers help and tune everyone else out. Good wishes to you.", "NTA but in all honesty, OP shouldn\u2019t be concerned with stepson\u2019s homework, schooling, video games, etc with all of the stress she has going on. Dad can handle that on his own. It makes absolutely no sense to punish stepson on her way out of the door to the hospital. That\u2019s small potatoes to be worried about being nine months pregnant, dealing with health crisis with mom, and balancing her employment. If there was an agreement about discipline, the father could have dealt with it when he got home. IMO, there was no need to be superwoman/mom if dad could\u2019ve disciplined stepson when he gets home from work. \n\nDad didn\u2019t have to be a butthole about his games being lost but that also means the PS5 is being used by both dad and stepson.", "Why the fuck is he at home playing his ps5 while his pregnant wife is in the hospital with her sick mother? And why are you thinking that's okah and staying married to this asshole?", "NTA since you agreed not to let hom have electronics until he does homework. \n\nI am curious why your stepdad couldn't make medical decisions though, usually the spouse is the person they ask to do that. You shouldn't have to spend the night in an uncomfortable hospital room while pregnant if her husband us right there.", "FYI I have metal in my back and have had numerous MRIs since and have come to no harm", "This is good advise for OP's bf. NTA\n\nGood luck with the baby and I'm sorry for what you are dealing with regarding your Mom.", "They're not actually married yet, but he's a good man to all of us that my siblings and I consider him our stepdad.", "What an atrocious thing to say to someone losing a parent, shame on you."]}
