Just as luck would have it, my brother-in-law makes wood cabinets and furniture for a living.\n\nWe told him our plans and chatted with him about everything we would want in our kitchen. I know he is busy and works with a few high end architects so I wanted to be sure he could work with us in our time frame, and he said he would love to work with us to make our dream kitchen, so we connected him with our designer. Well, he ended up quoting me nearly $70,000\u2026 for cabinets! Naturally I balked at that because who has that sort of money, and also because he\u2019s my own BIL.\n\nI called him sure he made a mistake but he doubled down saying this is already a significant \u201cfriends and family\u201d discount, and that\u2019s the cost of everything with all the finishes I asked for and for the size of my kitchen. Then he felt the need to tell me there are more cost effective ways to achieve the same look if I would consider veneer, or choose a different wood species, or compromise on various other areas. I said he should be ashamed of trying to charge his own family these kinds of outrageous prices! He said he\u2019s not ashamed and he\u2019s got plenty of business without mine so I can get a quote from someone else and he hung up on me!!\n\nI texted him that I don\u2019t feel in the wrong on the situation, and he can apologize or otherwise not come to our place for Christmas this year. He\u2019s not responded and my husband is saying we should just drop it and wants me to take back my demand for an apology.", "created_utc": 1701904199, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ch2vw/aita_for_calling_out_my_bil_for_price_gouging_me/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

BF is making me bookshelves and a desk and we were considering oak for them, and damn.... that added up quick, $300 or so just for the wood.

Or you will end up compromising on some things. \n\nYou will end up getting somebody else, because your BIL just won\u2019t be able to fit you into his busy schedule. \n\nYTA For how harsh you were when you heard the price.

But Hell would probably be colder before that happens, on your terms.", "YTA. That pricing sounds reasonable for your requested hardwood cabinets. Even million dollar homes don't have solid hardwood cabinets.", "YTA. I mean, solid wood cabinets are going to cost. Custom work is going to cost. Upgraded hardware is expensive. The finish on the cabinets can also cause the cost to vary greatly. \nDo some price shopping with other actual cabinet builders and then see if your BIL is so out of line. You won\u2019t get Home Depot prices and quality, you will get what you pay for.", "Many years ago I had a small business. Someone advised me to never say no to a potential customer, to instead quote a high-enough price so that they would go somewhere else.", "YTA - do you have the slightest clue what walnut costs?  Cabinet making is also a specialized skill.  He's a busy man (your words) so you're gonna pay for his skills.  My parents paid 30k for a generic kitchen job.  High end kitchens come with high end prices.", "My BIL does the same type of work and it sounds to me like your BIL didn't price gouge. It sounds as if you expect him to do all this for free with only the cost of materials. That's something my BIL would do but he's consistently been stomped all over his whole life by everyone taking advantage of the fact he won't say no. The thing is, even if I would ask him to do a job like this and he would say no charge for my labor, I wouldn't accept that. I couldn't. I would want to pay him fair market value for his labor knowing how hard it is to get by now. I always feel especially bad for him because I've seen how most people ESPECIALLY his family walk all over him like a door mat. They don't care about his family or kids or that he has to make a living. They only care what they want and they know he'll do it at the cost of all else. It's people like you who take advantage and are more than the ah. You're the self centered, world revolves around you, no one else matters but me ah.", "You should get some other quotes in, then you'll realise your BIL was being very generous.  You owe him an apology.", "YTA and completely ignorant of the reality of what your \"dream\" actually costs.\n\nGood luck with your \"put it together yourself\" Ikea cabinets.

You didn\u2019t even get another quote so how could you say he is price gouging you.", "YTA - He isn\u2019t gouging you.\n\nEverything costs more now, it\u2019s 2023, not 1993.", "Yeah YTA big time. \n\nThis is like walking into target, and convincing yourself you\u2019re being scammed on a box of cereal. With no information on prices at any other stores. \n\nHow can you decide you\u2019re being scammed, with no other quotes?", "YTA custom built all wood cabinets are very expensive, and if your kitchen is a decent size, I fully believe that is the discounted price!

There\u2019s nothing for him to apologize for, simply thank him and move to a different plan.", "YTA, wood prices are insane and I believe they've come down a little.

My father was a master carpenter and general contractor for most of his life and I learned a lot working with him.  Hand made custom cabinets are expensive, and  Walnut is one of the more rare and most expensive hardwoods to work with.   On the cheap end, an average size kitchen would be about $6,000.  If you have a medium to large kitchen, you\u2019re looking at considerably more.  if you don\u2019t like his prices, don\u2019t hire him, but I also feel like as a professional, you shouldn\u2019t expect him to do the work for nothing.", "YTA. Would you demand an apology from a cabinetmaker NOT related to you?", "YTA. Sounds like you were ignorant about how much the cabinetry *you wanted* costs and then blamed the messenger. You owe him an apology ASAP - it\u2019s not his fault it\u2019s out of your budget.", "That price sounds perfectly reasonable. My sister and BIL just redid their kitchen and laundry and it was 25k for Lowe\u2019s cabinets. There\u2019s no panels and it all paint grade.", "YTA for accusing your BIL of price gouging with no proof. You had no second or third estimate from other quality carpenters and you don't mention your interior designer raised red flags. The price of wood has risen in the past three years and high end carpentry takes time and skill. As you mentioned, your BIL works for upscale architects. I would guess his prices are higher than normal in general based and even with a family discount it would be higher than less skilled carpenters. Your BIL then offered to help you find ways to save money and you seem insulted by that. Then you demand an apology and threaten him with no Christmas invite. Claim sticker shock, but you do owe an apology.", "YTA. Others here have already said it, but I'll reiterate it. You want solid hardwood, custom-made cabinets. Those are *very* expensive, and your BIL's quote is absolutely not extraordinary.

This is on you to fix.", "You are asking for things that cost SIGNIFICANT amounts, but don't wanna pay the cost of that? Most of BILs fees are just for the materials for your precious \"dream\" and it's time to face reality that your dream is way more expensive then you thought. This is his line of work, not a hobby. He deserves to be paid the rates he runs at, and if you aren't okay with that price? Try finding someone else. You don't demand a handcrafter to lower their prices. He also does not owe you an apology for simply quoting you the cost of labor AND parts.
