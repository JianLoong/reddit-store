He refuses to move out or get a job. \n\nDuring Covid I quit a well paying job overseas to move home and care for my aging (divorced) parents.

She lives about an hour from me and I don\u2019t see her as much as I would like. \n\nI have also been able to work my way into a great job with a successful startup. Making decent money with good work life balance (needed for Dad), company car and good benefits. They are also desperate for people. \n\nI encouraged my brother to apply, with my endorsement. He did and got the job. He\u2019s autistic and hates working with other people - but in this job he got his own company car, works entirely alone, sets his own schedule, etc. he hasn\u2019t worked for almost seven years when during his last job (part time) he was pulled over for speeding - and decided to ignore the cops commands and ended up getting tased and charged with assaulting a cop. \nEven he admitted he needs to turn his life around and with the choices he has made he doesn\u2019t have many good options. \n\nFast forward six months. He\u2019s been doing well, I\u2019m proud of him and he\u2019s making money. Until last week when I realize on Mondays he just doesn\u2019t want to get out of bed and lies to work. I told him off for this and if I caught it again I would have to inform our boss. He played nice for a week until yesterday, when I stopped by and found him in bed at 10:00am, having lied to our boss about where he was. I confronted him and got him out the door to go to work. \n\nTurns out he just went and bought weed then went straight home again. He quit the job effective immediately and told our boss to come pick up his stuff. This less than a week after that same boss handed him a bonus cheque for $1000 and thanked him for all his work. It\u2019s the easiest job in the world\u2026. Truly. Some days I wonder how I was so lucky to land it. And now my brother has thrown it away. His excuse (literally in his resignation letter) was that he couldn\u2019t find the motivation to work. \n\nHis plan is to get back on government disability and let my Mom pay for him until she dies, then he has no plan. \n\nI was enraged by this. Begged him to reconsider. Our bosses were shocked and did the same. He rudely refused and seems happy and proud that he quit. He\u2019s looking forward to weed and video games.

Even though she agrees what he did was absolutely stupid and a betrayal of everyone. \n\nHe never helps with our father.

Since your brother says his long term plan is suicide is there an agency that can offer support?", "NTA.  Your brother is lazy and a leech. Can you inform the government that he is not really disabled?  Limited government resources should go to those who are truly disabled and need them - not to people like your brother.", "Nta", ">his future has been killed by her love\n\nThis is a very accurate and poignant way to describe it. The sad part is she sees and acknowledges this but cannot bear to do anything \u2018harmful\u2019 to her special baby boy, even if it means pushing him out to fend for himself. They will go down together.", "Pretty much. In the past he has been open about preferring to just mooch off our Mom until she dies. He has no qualms about it.", "They\u2019re hiring\u2026 \n\nOne of our coworkers is also a deadbeat stoner ski bum. I trained him so I know. He basically phones in his job (same job) and works half days.

He has fully been through \u201cthe system\u201d; their solution was to give him Neetbux and dope him with SSRIs.", "I am working on it and hope to do so today. I have a copy of his resignation letter where he straight up says he \u201cjust isn\u2019t motivated to work\u201d.

However that will come to him in his mid-40s and I doubt he will have any chance of turning things around.

The whole situation is a nightmare. I can only hope that he wakes up and recognizes his folly before it\u2019s too late. But honestly it was too late a decade ago.", "Thank you for your comments and suggestions. They are appreciated. I am not in the UK.
