Your gf sounds insecure. Odd that she wants you to like her for her physical attributes rather than the much more important values (non physical) you listed.

She sounds insecure and is probably hoping that you would confirm that she is your type. I'm guessing you guys are still young. \n\nWhen I was younger, I was very insecure about my body type. When my husband and I first got together, I asked him what his ideal body type was and told him to be honest. He ended up telling me my brother's girlfriend's body type was his ideal size. I was devastated. I didn't get angry with him because I asked for honesty but it took me a while to get over my insecurity. I wish he would have said I was his ideal. He told me he likes a wide range though and reassured me he finds me attractive.\n\nI would take this opportunity to reassure her that you find her attractive and like her for who she is.

My husband & I have been married for almost 20 years. When we met, I had a very specific type, physically, which he was. After we started getting to know each other, this topic came up. My now husband was adamant he didn\u2019t have a \u201ctype\u201d and I was baffled. What made me special then?! He made me realize **I** was special because he thought I was. It wasn\u2019t anything specific about my physically, but all of me made me his type. \n\nNow that I have time and distance from the situation, I can clearly see how asinine I acted. But at the time, I needed to hear how what of me made me special to him. I recommend sitting down with her and letting her know what specifically about her, personality wise & physically, makes her your type.
