Not super close, but we've gotten along well as kids and adults. I'm married and I have two children with my wife. We're quite well off, so we afford to live in a nice house and provide everything our children need.\n\nMy brother likes to call himself a \"ladies' man\". I find that icky, but I never comment on it when he brings it up because it's none of my business how he lives his life. The problem is that all his relationships ended not only in huge failure, but also numerous children. He has eight children from several different women, most of whom abandoned him and the kids.\n\nFive of these children live with him in his 3-bedroom apartment. The other ones live with their mothers/grandparents and my brother pays child support. All of this is very tough on him financially. I lend him money sometimes, but most of the time I refuse because even if I can afford to give him money, I can't possibly support another family when I already have my own. He also asks for ridiculous sums that would affect my wife and I if we gave that much money at once. I have also babysat his kids whenever I could, but they are a handful.\n\nEvery time my brother comes over with his kids he complains that he's out of money, his apartment is a mess, he has no peace and quiet, if he could turn back time, he'd do things differently, that I'm lucky and privileged and he wishes he had my life etc.\n\nI told him to get a vasectomy. He doesn't want to because it's not \"manly\" to do that. I told him to pack his junk in a bunch of condoms. He told me he forgets \"in the heat of the moment\". I call bullshit, but he just wouldn't listen.\n\nYesterday he came to the house in a rush, clearly agitated. It seems he got another woman pregnant and she gave birth two days ago (so he didn't tell me for freaking nine months). He was at the hospital with her, she birthed the baby and two days later she disappeared. He's stuck with the baby. He's asked me for an enormous amount of money because he has debts and wants me to keep the baby. I told him no and that he needs to schedule himself for a vasectomy right now because I'm tired of it all and to find the mother of the child and settle things. If not, give the baby to a caring adoptive family.\n\nHe's really mad and called me an asshole, heartless and other names because I don't care about his child. I care and I want the baby to have a family that can provide for him. Am I really an asshole? He's blowing my phone with horrible messages and now I'm doubting myself.", "created_utc": 1673377838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108i1fn/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_brother/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
