Same with my feet, I didn't walk properly, now I've got feet issues that I wear orthotics for because they didn't form properly in youth. (either from walking poorly, and/or just poor bone structure). I used to eat junk food all the time and they'd nag me about my diet, and now I have issues like IBS, which I blame internally for malnutrition in my youth. As I'm older, I realize they were just worried about me because they had or had seen similar issues, but not all opportunities to correct them, and I now nag my younger cousins about the same thing.", "NTA and rightful to sound rude as she was, can't fight nice to psychopaths.
