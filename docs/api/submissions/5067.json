Our rule is that if a child is in school, then they do not need to get a job or pay rent. If they have finished school, then they need to have a job and pay rent. Charlotte got her associate's last year and isn't interested in any more school. We offered Charlotte a deal that she could either pay a $1500 monthly rent (we live in a very expensive area, so $1500 is less than half of what most people pay every month for rent) or she could help with Sebastian and Leo and not have to pay any rent. Charlotte chose to help with her brothers and not pay rent.\n\nWilliam and I asked Charlotte to drop off and pick up Sebastian and Leo from school on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, as well as any needed appointments. We reimbursed Charlotte for the gas she spent driving them. William and I do not go out very often (maybe three times a month.) We always got Charlotte's go-ahead before making plans and asking her to stay home with Sebastian and Leo.\n\nLast month, William and I planned to meet with a friend for dinner, but our friend had to cancel last minute for an emergency. We decided to go back home and immediately noticed that Charlotte's car was gone and Sebastian and Leo were in the front yard playing. When we asked where Charlotte was, Sebastian and Leo explained that she had left earlier and they were locked outside. Sebastian and Leo told us that Charlotte leaving them home alone was a very normal thing, but they didn't say anything before since they didn't think it was a big deal and also liked being home alone. William and I kept trying to call Charlotte but she was not picking up. About a half hour before William and I planned on being home (we had been calling her for over three hours at this point) Charlotte pulled up in the driveway.\n\nWilliam and I told Charlotte she cannot babysit Sebastian and Leo anymore. She's lied to us for over a year and destroyed our trust in her. Charlotte is now paying $1500 in rent every month, which helps cover the cost of Sebastian and Leo's nanny. Charlotte got frustrated last Friday and told William and I how unfair we were to make her pay $1500 on top of doing chores. We told Charlotte if she wants to live in this house, then those are the rules. If she doesn't like it then she can go ahead and walk out the door.\n\nCharlotte\u2019s biological mom Phoebe called William and I awful parents and accused us of choosing our \u201cnew\u201d children over Charlotte. Phoebe posted a rant on Facebook voicing this opinion. Friends have reached out to us because they know we aren\u2019t favoring Sebastian and Leo over Charlotte. But they said that we were too harsh in telling Charlotte to either deal with our rules or walk out the door, because it\u2019s a hard thing to hear from your parents at any age and we should try to work out a compromise. But Charlotte broke our trust and lied for over a year. I don\u2019t see how a \u201ccompromise\u201d would solve anything. AITA?\n\nSome additional information because several people have asked: Charlotte works as an ultrasound technician and earns about $5000 every month. In our area, most \"starter homes\" cost more than $3000 every month, not counting utilities.\n\nPhoebe moved two hours away after Charlotte turned 18.

I give my parents money every week we all do fair share of chores etc. it depends on the family dynamic and \u201csocial norms\u201d of the country which is at 18 they\u2019re \u201cadults\u201d but most schools don\u2019t even teach basic adulting so we\u2019ve been prepping our kids now so they\u2019re aware and they know they don\u2019t have to move out bc it\u2019s expensive adulting on your own when you\u2019re not ready.", "I agree with you re so many people on reddit treating their adult kids like random lodgers, buuuut I'm not so sure that's what causes people not being able to buy houses.\n\nI live in the UK, where also lots of people can't afford houses. My parents would happily let me live with them for free, and I did it for a year-ish as an adult during the pandemic. But they live in an area with not great public transport and not great career opportunities, and while I was there I basically felt trapped in the house most of the time because I just didn't have anywhere I could go.\n\nAnd I know a lot of people with similar stories - it's not that they can't live at home, it's that where their parents live doesn't suit them. Maybe that's because of a culture with more of an emphasis on careers and independence, but I think it's mostly not people's families kicking them out.\n\nI wouldn't base your judgement of a whole society off of the kind of people posting on reddit lol", "Ya- the 22 year old makes plenty of money to move out, find some roommates and control how much rent she pays.", "Appointments are usually in advance. So I don\u2019t think thats considered on call. Also it\u2019s not her home it\u2019s the rents home and she agreed to the agreement.", "Thank you either way she has a sweet deal.", "Besides doing choirs, and maybe paying some bills. Yes... I do.\n\nImagine 2 scenarios. One where the 22 year old moves out, and the other where they don't.\n\nWhen they move out, they need to pay rent, that is money going to a land lord. Then they need to pay for internet, gas, heating, electricity, light, etc. All of these will be more than what she would use at her parents. All of this is wealth that is leaving them into another's persons bank account.\n\nNow the one that doesn't. They will do their choirs, and pay some bills to offset the day to day cost and workload of living the the parents, but nothing more. They aren't baby sitters, unless they get paid to be, and have no responsibility to their siblings. Instead of paying money to a strange... they can save it to buy a home in the future. The wealth remains with them, and will help them be successful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is literally how it has always worked everywhere in the world. From peasants to kings. Why America in the last 40 years seem to think this is somehow outrageous?", "I\u2019m 26 and living with my parents. My parents lived with their parents until they were my age. My older sister lived with us until this age.\n\nI\u2019m trying to start my career and in the meantime I\u2019m doing all the shopping and cooking and my dad has had several health problems this year so I\u2019m helping my parents a lot since he\u2019s out of commission. \n\nOur families actually like their kids and want them around but also want them to be totally independent if they can and want to be. It\u2019s sad that so many parents seem to genuinely dislike to hate their own kids once they turn 18. Why even have them if you\u2019re only going to tolerate them while they\u2019re minors?", "She doesn\u2019t have a studio apartment. She has a room in a house where she has to also do family chores and has a bunch of rules and lack of freedom compared to renting a room.\n\nThe rent is way to high, but they can do whatever they want.", ">They will do their choirs, and pay some bills to offset the day to day cost and workload of living the the parents, but nothing more. They aren't baby sitters, unless they get paid to be, and have no responsibility to their siblings.\n\nLOL. Maybe where you\u2019re from.  My family is from Pakistan.  It is EXPECTED that older children help out with younger children.  It\u2019s not even referred to as \u201cbabysitting\u201d - just as helping.  If the older kids ever dared to imply that it \u201cwasn\u2019t their job\u201d or some Western garbage like that, they would very quickly get set straight.\n\nFamilies help each other out.  Each member of the family has a responsibility to every other member of the family.  It\u2019s crazy to me that you think it\u2019s ok for an adult child to live at home FOR FREE without being fully involved in family responsibilities.", ">Our families actually like their kids and want them around but also want them to be totally independent if they can and want to be. It\u2019s sad that so many parents seem to genuinely dislike to hate their own kids once they turn 18.\n\nMaybe because your families actually **respect** your parent's household/rules.  Maybe because the adult children in your families don't leave the minor siblings locked outside the house for hours while they are out and about.  Or maybe because children who turns 18-20 prefer to move out on their own and learn what it is to truly be an adult."]}
