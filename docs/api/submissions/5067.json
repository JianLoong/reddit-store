{"id": 5067, "submission_id": "zp762d", "title": "AITA For telling my daughter that if she doesn't like the rules of our house then she can go ahead and walk out the door?", "selftext": "My husband William and I have three children: Charlotte (22f), Sebastian (11m) and Leo (7m.) Our rule is that if a child is in school, then they do not need to get a job or pay rent. If they have finished school, then they need to have a job and pay rent. Charlotte got her associate's last year and isn't interested in any more school. We offered Charlotte a deal that she could either pay a $1500 monthly rent (we live in a very expensive area, so $1500 is less than half of what most people pay every month for rent) or she could help with Sebastian and Leo and not have to pay any rent. Charlotte chose to help with her brothers and not pay rent.\n\nWilliam and I asked Charlotte to drop off and pick up Sebastian and Leo from school on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, as well as any needed appointments. We reimbursed Charlotte for the gas she spent driving them. William and I do not go out very often (maybe three times a month.) We always got Charlotte's go-ahead before making plans and asking her to stay home with Sebastian and Leo.\n\nLast month, William and I planned to meet with a friend for dinner, but our friend had to cancel last minute for an emergency. We decided to go back home and immediately noticed that Charlotte's car was gone and Sebastian and Leo were in the front yard playing. When we asked where Charlotte was, Sebastian and Leo explained that she had left earlier and they were locked outside. Sebastian and Leo told us that Charlotte leaving them home alone was a very normal thing, but they didn't say anything before since they didn't think it was a big deal and also liked being home alone. William and I kept trying to call Charlotte but she was not picking up. About a half hour before William and I planned on being home (we had been calling her for over three hours at this point) Charlotte pulled up in the driveway.\n\nWilliam and I told Charlotte she cannot babysit Sebastian and Leo anymore. She's lied to us for over a year and destroyed our trust in her. Charlotte is now paying $1500 in rent every month, which helps cover the cost of Sebastian and Leo's nanny. Charlotte got frustrated last Friday and told William and I how unfair we were to make her pay $1500 on top of doing chores. We told Charlotte if she wants to live in this house, then those are the rules. If she doesn't like it then she can go ahead and walk out the door.\n\nCharlotte\u2019s biological mom Phoebe called William and I awful parents and accused us of choosing our \u201cnew\u201d children over Charlotte. Phoebe posted a rant on Facebook voicing this opinion. Friends have reached out to us because they know we aren\u2019t favoring Sebastian and Leo over Charlotte. But they said that we were too harsh in telling Charlotte to either deal with our rules or walk out the door, because it\u2019s a hard thing to hear from your parents at any age and we should try to work out a compromise. But Charlotte broke our trust and lied for over a year. I don\u2019t see how a \u201ccompromise\u201d would solve anything. AITA?\n\nSome additional information because several people have asked: Charlotte works as an ultrasound technician and earns about $5000 every month. In our area, most \"starter homes\" cost more than $3000 every month, not counting utilities.\n\nPhoebe moved two hours away after Charlotte turned 18. So a commute from Phoebe's house to Charlotte's current job is obviously impossible. That is Phoebe's reasoning for why she cannot take Charlotte in and expects William and I to just let what Charlotte did slide.", "created_utc": 1671394343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp762d/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_if_she_doesnt/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have your daughter arrested for child endangerment. You employed her, as a willing adult, to care for children and she left them abandoned and locked out of the house in winter. \n\nEvict her immediately and tell everybody why.", "NTA. She lied to you and exposed her brothers to a dangerous situation. You have the right to not trust her anymore. However if you want to give her a second chance you can make her pay for her costs with groceries, cleaning, electricity, water and obviously her personal thinks with hygiene, clothing etc. Make the costs will be similar with the rent and she will learn about responsibility.", "NTA\n\nShe's not a child. She's 22. And leaving the two younger kids home alone could get you in a world of problems depending on the rules in your state. She's been irresponsible, apparently for quite some time. \n\nIn the beginning she had a choice of arrangements. She chose the childcare option and then didn't hold up her side of the deal, so you put her into the other option of paying rent. It's not like you kicked her out, which you totally could have done, technically, since she's an adult.\n\nIf her bio-mom is so invested in her living arrangements, why doesn't she offer a spot in HER home?\n\nAnd if paying rent and doing some chores seems onerous to her, she's going to have a rough time of dealing with full-fledged adulting when she's on her own. \n\nSeems to me the \"compromise\" here is that you're still letting her live in your home at all.

Then she actively went behind your back for over a year not fulfilling her end of the deal. Also leaving the boys at home and locked out of the house, seems to be the norm for her while you are out of the house. It\u2019s lucky you discovered what she was doing before something bad happened to the boys. \n\nAlso $1500 a month is nothing in a city that is expensive. If it\u2019s a major city like the one I live in, then that wouldn\u2019t even get you a studio apartment, so really she shouldn\u2019t be complaining cause if she had her own place she would pay rent, utilities, cook her own meals and then still have to do chores. People saying you shouldn\u2019t charge your children are also the ones who get shocked when their adult children are not independent and still rely on them in adulthood.", "I thought this was going to be about curfew or cooking fish or something, but instead, it's about *endangering your younger kids' lives.*\n\nNTA.  I can't believe she got away with it this long.", "I would NTA because of what she did to your other kids but... What kind of job is she doing to be able to pay 1500 rent?

While $1500 may be a bit much (it should be 30% of her income), she was actually negligent with your kids, and had CPS been called you would have been up shit creek for leaving your kids with someone so inept. SHE LOCKED THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE!  You're seriously lucky the police weren't called.  What she did was actually illegal.  \n\nI had roommates / renters in my house. They were expected to help keep the house clean and to pay rent.  It's part of renting space in the home.  If she doesn't like her living agreement, she can leave, which is easier with you than if she had a lease, so she should count her blessings.  It will be harder to throw these kinds of tantrums when she doesn't get along with actual roommates.  \n\nShe's lucky you didn't kick her out right then and there.  Honestly.
