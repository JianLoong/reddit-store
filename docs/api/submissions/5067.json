Our rule is that if a child is in school, then they do not need to get a job or pay rent. If they have finished school, then they need to have a job and pay rent. Charlotte got her associate's last year and isn't interested in any more school. We offered Charlotte a deal that she could either pay a $1500 monthly rent (we live in a very expensive area, so $1500 is less than half of what most people pay every month for rent) or she could help with Sebastian and Leo and not have to pay any rent. Charlotte chose to help with her brothers and not pay rent.\n\nWilliam and I asked Charlotte to drop off and pick up Sebastian and Leo from school on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, as well as any needed appointments. We reimbursed Charlotte for the gas she spent driving them. William and I do not go out very often (maybe three times a month.) We always got Charlotte's go-ahead before making plans and asking her to stay home with Sebastian and Leo.\n\nLast month, William and I planned to meet with a friend for dinner, but our friend had to cancel last minute for an emergency. We decided to go back home and immediately noticed that Charlotte's car was gone and Sebastian and Leo were in the front yard playing. When we asked where Charlotte was, Sebastian and Leo explained that she had left earlier and they were locked outside. Sebastian and Leo told us that Charlotte leaving them home alone was a very normal thing, but they didn't say anything before since they didn't think it was a big deal and also liked being home alone. William and I kept trying to call Charlotte but she was not picking up. About a half hour before William and I planned on being home (we had been calling her for over three hours at this point) Charlotte pulled up in the driveway.\n\nWilliam and I told Charlotte she cannot babysit Sebastian and Leo anymore. She's lied to us for over a year and destroyed our trust in her. Charlotte is now paying $1500 in rent every month, which helps cover the cost of Sebastian and Leo's nanny. Charlotte got frustrated last Friday and told William and I how unfair we were to make her pay $1500 on top of doing chores. We told Charlotte if she wants to live in this house, then those are the rules. If she doesn't like it then she can go ahead and walk out the door.\n\nCharlotte\u2019s biological mom Phoebe called William and I awful parents and accused us of choosing our \u201cnew\u201d children over Charlotte. Phoebe posted a rant on Facebook voicing this opinion. Friends have reached out to us because they know we aren\u2019t favoring Sebastian and Leo over Charlotte. But they said that we were too harsh in telling Charlotte to either deal with our rules or walk out the door, because it\u2019s a hard thing to hear from your parents at any age and we should try to work out a compromise. But Charlotte broke our trust and lied for over a year. I don\u2019t see how a \u201ccompromise\u201d would solve anything. AITA?\n\nSome additional information because several people have asked: Charlotte works as an ultrasound technician and earns about $5000 every month. In our area, most \"starter homes\" cost more than $3000 every month, not counting utilities.\n\nPhoebe moved two hours away after Charlotte turned 18. So a commute from Phoebe's house to Charlotte's current job is obviously impossible.

Or were you a minor or still in school? Because that's a different situation.

When I signed a lease with roommates we took turns cleaning; we didn't cook for one another as we had different schedules and different eating habits.", "As stated multiple times, signing a lease with peers requires sharing of chores; renting a room from a homeowner requires cleaning ones bedroom and bath if private, and cleaning up after oneself in common areas but in my experience no responsibility for general cleaning of common areas.

Which, again, when you have roommates, there is an agreement between EVERYONE on who does what. If her parents want to treat this like a landlord situation, then she should do the same, and treat them like landlords. The issue is she is complaining about paying. However OP does not give the exact details of what the daughter was complaining about. The prior agreement had been made between family because of trust. Daughter broke the trust. So why are the parents suppose to allow the daughter to stay if she can't be trusted? She is 22 years old. She is a grown adult who actively manipulated the situation. She chose to leave kids she was reasonable for alone. This is the  consequence of her own actions. She is not required to stay at home. She can look for a better, more affordable solution.

The only extras they are asking her to do are taking care of her siblings, and that is only 3x/week for a few hours.  And it's not like they are little kids that need constant supervision (obviously if she felt she could leave them home alone, locked out of the house for hours at a time).

With all the comparisons to \u201cliving with roommates\u201d to share space and rent- the 22 year old \u2018s behavior sucks-as a daughter renting OR a roommate.

She can still move out now for those supposedly cheaper rent rates. \n\nIf OP were being financially abusive, the answer again is not to risk the well-being of two kids while you go out doing who knows what. You save up your money while looking after the kids, so that no one suspects your exit, and once you have enough, you leave. \n\nIn fact, OP not asking for rent and childcare from Charlotte says to me that OP is not financially abusive. \n\nCharlotte ran a con that put the well-being of her younger siblings at risk.

Now you\u2019re pissed cause you\u2019re no longer in charge!", "Eh, ESH.\n\nBased on the prices you have listed $1500 is way too high for renting a single room.\n\nShe is essentially renting a single room while you are occupying 2-3 bedrooms and possibly other rooms.\n\nIf a starter house is $3000 she should be paying more $600-$1000.\n\nThe other alternative was her doing something that her $1500 doesn't even cover apparently showing you were taking advantage of her in that case as well \n\nAbdandoning the kids is crazy though...\n\nBut it's also crazy it took you a year to catch on.", "ESH\n\nShe was wrong in what she did. 100%. I\u2019m not denying that in the slightest.\n\nBut jeez, to ask for $1500/month in rent from your own kid???? That\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA until you said the $1500 helps cover the cost of the nanny\u2026\u2026. Her paying rent should be to teach her responsibility, not to subsidize the nanny. This is your job. Rethink how you think of your relationship with her - seems like something might be missing from this story making her feel less than. It is out of line for her to lock the kids outside.\n\nYTA.", "NTA.\n\nShe abandoned young children outside for hours and has done it for a year?\n\nKick her out, neglect like that doesn't deserve a second chance.", "NTA. What the heck is wrong with her?!?! She left the kids ALONE OUTSIDE!! ANYTHING could have happend! The cpuld have wonderd off. They could have been taking by some pervert! They could have had an accident! Neighbours could have calles CPS for child indangerment and neglect! I know I would have!!  But YTA because you have not yet kicked her out for putting your kids in danger multiple times! Is everbody just forgetting that she not only let a 11y and 7y unsupervised, she also locked them out! As in OUTSIDE!! With no way to get inside. What if they neede to use the bathroom, or were hungry of it started raining. I can not get over how a grownass girl can do something like this. And if her bio mom is so worries let her go live there! I would not have given her a choice but kicked her out untill such a time she apologises AND realises what she did wrong!", "NTA 22 is an adult", "I cannot believe that you\u2019re still letting her live with you, this is so horrifying.", "NTA as a 24 year old who lives with their parents I will say your daughter is the AH, she is an adult but she chooses to act like a child, 1500 is a lot but she chose the easy life, you guys are awesome parents for giving her the choice. she makes 5000 didnt have to pay rent, didn't have to pay for gas, probably didn't have to pay for food or anything. she just chose money over free time but then lied to still have the free time, she wanted both and any adult would know, both is not possible. if I were you I would have given her 6 months to move out or else she should life with her mom or on the street. she is an adult that hasn't learned that every action has a reaction.", "NTA I think you need to tell your daughter she has 3 months without paying rent and then she needs to move out. That gives her time to find a roommate or to save up first & last months rent.", "NTA for being upset that she lied and left two young children home alone (and locked outside?) because that\u2019s extremely shitty of her to do.\n\nHowever, some perspective. I don\u2019t know where you live but presumably most places now have a housing crisis or at least getting into the housing market or renting can be really difficult. If you want her to move out faster I\u2019d suggest charging her less rent so she can save more to move out. Same with the expectation that she would do so much of the running around with pick up and drop offs. I don\u2019t know her work hours but potentially having these commitments may interfere with her ability to work certain hours which may also affect her ability to save. Ultimately you want her to move our ASAP and the reality is that\u2019s hard to do these days so if you can support her where feasible it might make the process quicker.", "Coming from another parent of adults here:  NTA, not by any means.\n\nLet's cover the obvious first:  Charlotte is an adult.  She can and obviously does make her own choices at this point.  She chose to live with her parents, she chose to take a plum deal, and she chose to abuse the terms of that deal.  Now she gets to deal with the consequences.\n\nLeaving kids that age alone can result in criminal charges.  At the age of 11, your son is not old enough (in most states) or responsible enough to \"mind\" his younger brother.  To compound matters, it doesn't sound like either boy has been trained on what to do in basic emergencies, such as one of them getting hurt, bitten by a stray dog, or if strangers try to forcefully take them while they're innocently playing outside.  My point is, Charlotte's deception could have had very bad consequences not only for the boys, but for your husband and you.  \n\nAnd that is where you have to ask yourself whether having Charlotte in the home is helping you at all.  Obviously, she tells you what you want to hear, then goes off and does her own thing regardless of the consequences of her abandoning her brothers.  That is not a safe environment for your younger kids to be left, and I feel quite sure that the current situation is strained, to say the least.  Charlotte wants it all in her favor, though:  she wants cheaper \"rent\", no responsibilities, and the ability to disrespect her own parents on social media, and to other family/friends, if she doesn't get her way.\n\nA few Biblical quotes come to mind:  \"Get rid of the contentious person, and all contention will cease.\", and \"It is better to live on the corner of a roof than to share a home with a quarrelsome woman.\"  (Gotta love the no-nonsense, in-your-face approach of Proverbs.)  And I don't normally quote Scripture, but in this case, it proves a point:  in order for your home to once again be peaceful, you must eject the person who destroy the home's peace.  Charlotte is fighting to be on an equal adult footing with your husband and you, but with two young boys yet to finish raising, you cannot afford to give her that kind of leeway.  I get it.\n\nI often see the whole, \"your house, your rules\" in subs, and nowhere is this more acceptable than here.  Your generous offer of a mutually beneficial living arrangement with the now-adult Charlotte was shamelessly abused, and then the consequences of that abuse provoked her to start complaining and fighting even more.  Since your husband and you are the names on the mortgage (and the names responsible if the boys are left alone without supervision), Charlotte needs to find other living arrangements that better suit her independent lifestyle.  Her income might not be enough to afford a luxury apartment in your current area, but she can certainly afford a lower-midrange apartment or a roommate arrangement.  And the selling point is this:  no kids to look after, no parents to obey, and her time is completely and utterly her own to manage.  In your shoes, I'd be giving her a move-out date, and cleaning out my closets to give her linens, pots, etc., to help her on her brand-new independent adult life.   It's very obvious, to me at least, that in between the irresponsible behavior and the malicious gossiping afterwards, Charlotte has proven to have outgrown living with her parents at all.", "She\u2019s an adult, time to grow up and move out.  NTA", "NTA. She left 2 minors unattended and locked out of the house, without thinking of the possibility of them getting hurt or kidnapped. She knew what she was signing up for and broke the rules. If she wants no responsibility, she can gladly move out.", "NTA\n\nShe is lucky you didn\u2019t report her for child abandonment/endangerment, they were locked outside for 3 hours in the winter. I\u2019d be kicking her out not making her pay rent, she\u2019s an adult, actions have consequences and she\u2019s very lucky her brothers didn\u2019t get hurt.", "NTA\n\nshe put those kids in danger each time you needed her to watch them.\n\nid kick her out.", "NTA my biggest concern would be that she thought nothing of leaving two young kids to fend for themselves! she locked an 11 and 7 year old out of the house alone! That is child abuse! She's lucky you didn't just make her leave! What she did is so dangerous!!! I would be livid.....\nShe's 22, sounds like it's time for her to start looking for her own place or roommates to move in with.", "So here\u2019s the thing. She can go literally anywhere she wants to work. Its about time for her to find a job where she can also live independently\u2026 also she lied big ti her parents and locking the kids outside??? Did they have a way to call mom and dad for help? That part would do it for me. She would be on an eviction notice for that.", "NTA:  \n\n\nAnd to those who say \"$1500 is too high for a room in a shared house\", well, it clearly isn't for where they live and for what it covers in this specific case (my guess is that it includes food and bills). If Charlotte could live better for less (and she has that $5000 a month job remember), then why wouldn't she? This arrangement clearly \\*benefited\\* her, and she took the piss and put kids in danger. Time for her to move out.", "NTA  On the baby sitting  agreement,  but YTA  on charging  your daughter  1500  rent a month  thats my whole months rent  for a 3 bedroom house . I just couldn't  imagine  charging  my son that much rent , yes he contributes to the household  but  I would just never ask that of him    . You don't seem like that you like your daughter very much", "This", "Just to add, I have lived in some of the most expensive markets and I have never come across a standard market rate for a room in a house for $1500. If you were charging at cost as a family/ seeking contribution for footprint\u2026then I would get that\u2026if you wanted more of a transactional set up, and you chargers her market rate for a room in a house, it\u2019 still likely has a mark up, and is making money\u2026but that\u2019s more reasonable. but charging the price a landlord would charge ( which has a mark-up) plus an additional mark up because you are charging way beyond what normal room would cost ( you are not renting her a single apartment it\u2019s irrelevant that she would be paying more if she was on an apartment on her own\u2026because she would be getting more for what she was paying for) is a bit excessive.", "Yea, I don't understand how she can possibly work, and be there for the kids. Sounds like she is responsible for sports, and all Dr's appts too... but wouldn't you want to be part of some of these things as a parent?", "It depends what the chores are, if it's clean the bathroom and living areas in turn then fair enough. If it's do everyone's washing then no it isn't fair", "She's getting a room not an apartment so isn't really a valid comparison", "That is rent", "You're only counting renting a place. Hers probably includes utilities and food. Even if it costs only 1000 to rent a bedroom or share an apartment with a roommate, you would still pay a lot more for utilities and expenses. Plus buying all new furniture and appliances. Charlotte literally had a FREE stay if she helps a bit with the boys.", "I found Phoebe!!", "Parents are the end all of responsibility when it comes to their children. Anyone saying otherwise is a shit parent.\n\nCharlotte might be an asshole but when you try and gouge someone on rent so that they don't balk at what you are asking them to do for you in place of rent, then make the person you are fucking over responsible for your children... You're a dumb dumb dumb terrible parent.\n\nEventually it was going to become obvious. The arrangement was extremely one sided and she would try and wiggle out of it so she can breathe.", "In my area (Gulf South metro, college town), a decent apartment, located in an area not riddled with drugs and crime, goes for around $1,500 - $2,200, and that is not including utilities and services.  A \"decent\" 2-bedroom rental home in an ok neighborhood currently goes for around $2,400, sans utilities.  None of the prices I list cover luxury apartments or homes, those are considerably more per month.  And considering what interest rates currently are, buying a home is insanely prohibitive.  We looked at selling our home and buying another one, took one look at how much it was going to cost, and noped right out of the market.  We bought pre-COVID, and even with the homes in our neighborhood, which sold for around $350,000 with 2.9% interest then, the cost itself has risen to over $500,000 at a 6.447% interest rate.  No thanks.\n\nIn my neck of the woods, Charlotte would be getting a steal with what her parents charge.  Her cost covers utilities, laundry, and probably food/common area maid service/cook (Mom labor).  And to get all that just for watching her siblings/making a few appointments is incredibly generous, especially since she has completed her education.", "Yeah and I would think it would be different to ask her to contribute to a portion of the bills, but profiting form your kid just seems wrong, no matter how old they are", "When did u say I wasn't expected to contribute? There are a ton of ways to contribute to a household without being expected to be a a live in nanny or pay an insane amount of \"rent\" for one room. \n\nEven if it is \"spoiled\". Its normal in more cultures than not.", "Yeah cause she had a ton of good options", "No one gives a crap what you did when you were 11. An 11 and 7 yr old should not be locked outside for 3 hours by themselves with no way to get drinks or have instructions on what they should do of there is an emergency. I hope you don't have kids.", "She had to, being extremely generous on her side, spend 6 daytime hours a week and less than one evening a week, in exchange for all of her living expensive. That\u2019s not a full time live in nanny. That\u2019s basically a day a week. \n\nIf you had a job that would pay all your living expenses for one day a week, and then didn\u2019t bother to actually show up, do you think people would owe you sympathy for the consequences of your own actions and keep paying you anyway?  What was the contribution you were expected to make to your household that was less than that. \n\nPeople cry for these poor exploited 22 year olds being asked to do a fraction of what a fully independent adult would have to do, and then wonder why there\u2019s so many other posts involving entitled adults who expect their roommates/spouses/coworkers to wipe their asses for them. Sometimes literally apparently.", "Not really. The mortgage if 5000. Split that 4 ways and then add all of the extras. Such a utilities, trash, cable, and food. Seems super cheap to me."]}
