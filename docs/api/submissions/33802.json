{"id": 33802, "submission_id": "18rjbx7", "title": "AITA for not wanting to invite my autistic sister in law to my family birthday dinner?", "selftext": "My (26F) brother (32M) is not talking to me because I have not invited him or my sister in law to my family birthday dinner.  \n\n\nI am planning a birthday dinner at my favourite restaurant. I absolutely love seafood, and so does everyone in my family, so I want to make a reservation for a popular seafood place in my town.   \n\n\nThe issue is, my sister in law (Beth) is autistic and has some wishes when it comes to picking a restaurant. I have no trouble with that whatsoever, and I am happy to accomodate dietary wishes, but I can not tolerate weaponized illnesses. She is fine with seafood, but having dinner with her in a public place is incredibly exhausting.  \n\n\nI will spare you the details of our previous dinner, but here are some of Beth's wishes:  \n\n\n1. Beth must sit in a booth, against a wall. Chairs are a no go (I do not know the reason)  \n\n2. If Beth does not like the music, it needs to be turned off (Taylor swift is a yes, any other pop songs are a no)  \n\n3. No one is allowed to eat vegetables, because Beth does not eat them, and will lose her appetite if she sees them. (broccoli trauma?)  \n\n4. No kids in the restaurant (this will overstimulate her)\n5. We are not allowed to taste any of her food, but she will eat off your plate without asking.  \n\n\nIf any of these wishes are not followed, she will sulk/complain, and write a one star review for the restaurant. Whenever you confront her, she will make a scene and say stuff like ''It's because i'm autistic'', or ''You hate people who are neurodivergent''.  \n\n\nBecause of this, I talked to my parents about not inviting her. They agree with me, since it's my birthday, but told me to talk to my brother about it.  \n\n\nI called up my brother and explained the situation. He got angry because he feels that I do not consider her family, and that I could at least pick a restaurant that will make her feel welcome. Beth overheard the situation and has texted me several angry messages, and that I will never be invited to their house again.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for not inviting her?\n\nEdit:\nSome questions/notes that I will add/answer here:\n\n**Is there a restaurant that can accomodate to all 5 wishes?**There is one. It's in another town. It's an American Style buffet with booths, no music, 99% of the food is just pizza, fries, BBQ, pasta's and a tiny salad bar that you can easily miss if you're not looking for it. They do child free nights every first monday of the month. I did not want to go to this restaurant, because I simply do not enjoy the food or atmosphere. Also, my birthday is on a Friday, but I planned dinner on Thursday because it's more convenient for everyone.\n\n**Have I given my brother and Beth another option to celebrate?**No, and that is a great point. Something like not inviting them to dinner, but celebrating with them at their house with some drinks in a ''Beth safe'' environment. When I was on the phone with my brother that is exactly what I wanted to talk about. Sadly it could not get to that point of conversation.\n\n**How many people/who are invited?**\nList:\nParents\nFianc\u00e9\nYounger sister (20)\n2 childhood best friends (who grew up with us and lived with us)\n\n**Will there be other neurodivergent people?**Yes, I have invited my 2 best friends, and my sister (20F) who are also on the spectrum. This is the list of their wishes (combined)\n\n1. Fries and fishfingers/nuggets on the menu (they have a kids menu with fish fingers, fries and other fried snacks that my friend likes)\n2. No metal cutlery (she will bring her own plastic cutlery from home)\n\nTo me, these are incredibly reasonable and easy to manage.\n\n**What do my parents think about the situation?**They agree with me, but would like me to make peace with my brother. My dad has sent a message to him, asking if he could call me back to talk about it.  \n\n\nWe live in a western european country where booths are not very common, especially in nicer places.\n\nI would pay for the entire dinner\n\nI also apologize if I hurt anyone's feelings with the words \"weaponized illnesses\". I am trying to describe someone who is using their illness as an illegetimate excuse instead of an explanation ", "created_utc": 1703627642, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18rjbx7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_my_autistic_sister/", "score": 2266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Beth unfortunately cannot handle the world, and you simply cannot accommodate Beth's requirements. Technically, you could accommodate 3 and 5, but you shouldn't have to. You could possibly accommodate 1 if you coordinate ahead of time with the restaurant. However, 2 and 4 are things completely out of your control and not reasonably within the control of the restaurant (I know of absolutely zero restaurants that would agree to play a constant loop of Taylor Swift for two hours to accommodate one guest, and child-free restaurants are very, very rare). Beth is unfortunately going to miss out on a lot with her \"requirements.\" The world unfortunately does not cater to disabilities.", "NTA. It's a day to celebrate you and SIL is trying to take over it. If one truly has that many issues, then it is on them to take care of their needs, not everyone else. I 100% think she is using her autism as a weapon. Do they just stay in their home 99.9% of the time? Because her demands are nearly impossible to be met hence her 1 star bombing places.\n\nYou're friends requirements are easy to do. SIL's requirements basically require you to rent out an entire venue for her outing. Your brother is the dick also. HE married her, you did not.

I have worked with young autistic students who have been able to learn how to pick up social cues. I have worked with neurodivergent adults who have learned strategies to be able to cope in a world that\u2019s hard for them.

We host our own get togethers next time. I absolutely understand sensory issues and the need to control my environment- but I don\u2019t make that an issue for everyone else, let alone on their own birthday. \n\nSIL needs to work with a good OT on her sensory needs and expanding her window of tolerance. She also needs to work on her need to control. And again I say this from experience, she can\u2019t keep avoiding life like this.", "NTA", "NTA, she is weaponizing her autism.

Holy entitlement, Batman!", "NTA- it honestly sounds like she is using her autism as an excuse to to be a selfish AH. I\u2019ve worked with adults on the spectrum and even ones considered severe weren\u2019t this ridiculous. No ones allowed to eat vegetables? Does she not realize that almost every dish comes with a vegetable at restaurants? Are they not allowed to eat vegetables at home? Sounds like they\u2019re super unhealthy. Also the music and kid thing is insanely entitled. You cannot control what happens in a public space, nor should you. I wouldn\u2019t invite her either", "NTA.

How are you supposed to control if she gets seated in a booth, if children eat at the restaurant or what music is played.\n\nI would invite her but remind her you have not control over the above issues.  That way you still invited her and the ball is in her court.  Make this her dilemma not yours.", "NTA\n\nBeth is autistic\n\nBeth is also an entitled, self centered, angry and unreasonable woman with an enabling husband.\nThose are not mutually exclusive", "NTA", "NTA.......not invited to her home, ever again......sounds like a Win Win situation for you OP.

I would struggle to attend a party for Beth at a restraint picked by Beth.", "NTA I'm autistic and I'm with you on this. I feel like #1 is a reasonable request (not demand) to make, and I can sympathise with 2&4 because they can also overwhelm me very quickly but the onus is on the autistic person to make these situations tolerable for themselves (either by removing themselves/by a loved one, wearing earplugs or even just... Not attending). 2-5 combined with her vindictive behaviour makes me think she is not actually autistic or isn't bothered by these things to the degree she claims to be but rather she is entitled and an asshole using autism as an excuse.\n\nIf these things bother Beth and Beth loses appetite from the mere sight of veggies, maybe Beth should realise that you are there to celebrate you, not specifically to feed her and bend over backwards for her. Does your brother think these requests are fully reasonable and is he okay never having you over again over this?

I was exhausted reading the short list of wishes.

I mean -- this seems to be along the lines of \"nobody is allowed to eat vegetables because Beth doesn't eat them.\" So nobody is allowed to go to restaurants that may be unable to accommodate her insistence on not having any kids in the restaurant, or on controlling the music? And if you do go to such a restaurant, and don't invite her because she wouldn't like it, she bans you from her house forever? (That doesn't sound like a sweet person.) \"Weaponized illnesses\" is a good phrase. Yes, Beth, it's because you would not be comfortable there, and we don't want you to be stressed out. However, *we* can still go to *any* restaurant we choose, *because it's a boundary of ours and you can't control what other adults do.*", "NTA\n\nBut would it be possible to layout some ground rules that would let her still attend as long as she knows what\u2019s expected beforehand? For instance, from your 5 conditions:\n\n1. *booth against a wall*: This seems easily accommodated.\n\n2. *music*: some places do play music ridiculously loud. Maybe try to find a place with softer music or outdoor seating (often no music). But she can\u2019t complain.\n\n3. *no veggies* Beth has to get over this one because it\u2019s ridiculously unreasonable. Maybe don\u2019t put the giant broccoli bowl in front of her, but this is a Beth problem, not a family issue.\n\n4. *no kids* Again, a Beth issue, not a family issue. That said, nicer restaurants tend to have far fewer kids (or better behaved ones) than Waffle House, so maybe go a bit upscale? And maybe try to sit in a corner instead of a middle table.\n\n5. *no touching her food, but she can touch yours*. Yep - another Beth issue. Just set a strict rule that she can\u2019t touch any non-appetizer food.\n\nIf you want to keep the peace - and maybe start reintegrating your brother & his family back into yours, maybe have your brother gently talk with his wife and say everyone wants them to come, but here\u2019s a list of things they\u2019re concerned about.

I absolutely love seafood, and so does everyone in my family, so I want to make a reservation for a popular seafood place in my town.   \n\n\nThe issue is, my sister in law (Beth) is autistic and has some wishes when it comes to picking a restaurant. I have no trouble with that whatsoever, and I am happy to accomodate dietary wishes, but I can not tolerate weaponized illnesses. She is fine with seafood, but having dinner with her in a public place is incredibly exhausting.  \n\n\nI will spare you the details of our previous dinner, but here are some of Beth's wishes:  \n\n\n1. Beth must sit in a booth, against a wall. Chairs are a no go (I do not know the reason)  \n\n2. If Beth does not like the music, it needs to be turned off (Taylor swift is a yes, any other pop songs are a no)  \n\n3. No one is allowed to eat vegetables, because Beth does not eat them, and will lose her appetite if she sees them. (broccoli trauma?)  \n\n4. No kids in the restaurant (this will overstimulate her)\n5. We are not allowed to taste any of her food, but she will eat off your plate without asking.  \n\n\nIf any of these wishes are not followed, she will sulk/complain, and write a one star review for the restaurant. Whenever you confront her, she will make a scene and say stuff like ''It's because i'm autistic'', or ''You hate people who are neurodivergent''.  \n\n\nBecause of this, I talked to my parents about not inviting her. They agree with me, since it's my birthday, but told me to talk to my brother about it.  \n\n\nI called up my brother and explained the situation. He got angry because he feels that I do not consider her family, and that I could at least pick a restaurant that will make her feel welcome. Beth overheard the situation and has texted me several angry messages, and that I will never be invited to their house again.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for not inviting her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To deal with it, I would try to sit at the far end of a table, have some strong coffee or tea (mint if possible) nearby to cover the smell.

I would have loved this option precovid. Masks are darn useful. \nEating off others plates is just rude. She is old enough to understand that he wants and needs are not the only ones. No one else wants her taking food without permission, period. It is also unsanitary. Set a rule and tell her she will be made to sit alone if she takes food without asking.

It's fine to have a need that doesn't impose on others (e.g., preferring non-metal cutlery and providing your own) or isn't part of an imposing long list. SIL's limit everyone else to one restaurant that she likes. There is no excuse for imposing her will on your plate of food (while being perfectly capable of strictly prohibiting anyone touching her own). \"Weaponized illness\" is a very appropriate term for that.\n3. Since SIL would be miserable where you would like to eat AND would make everyone else miserable, it is absolutely reasonable for her not to be invited to this. There's a big difference between asking for some accommodations for her needs and demanding that every single person in the family cater to her needs/wants for every event (or she will raise an unrestrained stink and spoil things for everyone to the best of her ability). Even autistic people can and need to know there are consequences for their behavior and choices. She can be sad that her needs/wants/demands/choices mean she will not be invited to every event in your life, but threatening you more is not really helping her (and should not help her at all).\n4.

Op is unknowingly saying the disability, or extent of it, is made up when it comes to those things.  That isn't how disability works.
