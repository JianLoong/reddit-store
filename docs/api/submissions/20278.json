Yesterday, I was heating up my lunch while a team was distributing their lunch order from Chik-fil-A. One co-worker was confused because she had ordered a regular Chick-fil-A sandwich, and noticed that there were only spicy ones left. While she and another co-worker were looking over the receipt to confirm that the correct orders had been placed, a third co-worker walked up and asked what was going on. They informed him of the situation, and then he holds up his sandwich and comments that he had ordered a deluxe. I immediately noticed that he was holding a white sandwich wrapper, Chick-fil-A deluxe sandwiches always come in a box. So I realized he had accidentally grabbed her regular sandwich instead of grabbing his deluxe sandwich.\n\n\"Deluxe sandwiches always come in a box, regular sandwiches come in the white wrappers. You accidentally grabbed her lunch\"\n\nThe two women immediately laughed about the situation. The woman who was trying to help the one who had lost her lunch says \"You guys have got to start checking things before you just start grabbing food.\" I would like to clarify that she was not saying this in an angry tone. She wasn't even directly speaking to the guy who had grabbed the wrong lunch. The guy who grabbed the wrong lunch immediately crumples the wrapper and sandwich up in his hands and throws them across the room into the sink.

That\u2019s a wildly exaggerated response", "Violence. If you feel threatened send a note to HR, make sure the other 2 are on board, no one was angry at him, even if he was embarrassed that is not how you react", "NTA, and there was something seriously wrong with this man. Who throws a tantrum like that over a sandwich, and for his own mistake at that?", "So the atmosphere was joking? Everyone (except the sandwich grabber) was light hearted and teasing about it? No one was offended by the mistake and it was obvious no one was offended?  \n\nNTA.  That dude was clearly already on the edge. If something this insignificant causes that volatile of a reaction then something way bigger is in play.", "NTA\n\nThat reaction was completely out of line and was not your fault.", "NTA but if you\u2019re in America like me, I\u2019d watch that guy. That\u2019s not a normal reaction to have at your work place because you grabbed someone else\u2019s meal. He should have been apologizing, not throwing shit. Does he get the short end of the stick at work? or work in a position where he\u2019s dealing with coworkers in a negative way, like for example he\u2019s responsible for shipping orders and when one of his coworkers gets a call from an angry client about their order he gets bitched at?", "NTA - He screwed up and got called on it. Everyone there recognized it as trivial except the guy who apparently has so little humility that he can't just acknowledge he grabbed the wrong sandwich.", "NTA at all, but someone needs to report that guy to HR for seriously aggressive, inappropriate, potentially even threatening behaviour.\n\nPersonally, while he didn't directly threaten anyone, I would feel very unsafe around any adult who was so aggressive and completely unable to regulate his own emotions and behaviour in a professional setting that a friendly, joking reminder to double check which of the lunch orders he grabs before starting to eat (which is just common sense anyway) results in him ragefully throwing MULTIPLE whole, uneaten items of food across the room and storming out. That isn't just inappropriate, it's completely irrational and out of control. And I literally say that as a deeply sensitive autistic person who is easily overwhelmed; but if I was upset by something at work, I would quickly remove myself from the situation, and find somewhere quiet to calm down . . . not rage out and throw things. \n\nThis man needs to be reported. He could have hurt someone just throwing stuff around. And there's no guarantee how he could react to another upset if this is how he reacts to a gentle reminder over lunch.", "NTA, his reaction though is giving me some serious red flags", "NTA. \nIs he under pressure and this tipped him off ?\nYou were being helpful and it doesn\u2019t look like you were being nosy at all. \n\nEither your coworker is an AH who can\u2019t be told off or they get upset, or they have something else going off and this set them off unfortunately", "NTA-He seems like he has issues and you were unfortunately the recipient of his pent up anger/unhappiness with himself.", "\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned that this man is going to either get fired for making a scene, or quitting in anger all because of Chick-fil-A.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be worried - I\u2019d be actively hoping for one of those things to happen.\n\nNTA", "You are NTA. There is nothing wrong in pointing out an innocent mistake, especially so it doesn\u2019t happen again. Whether or not that man is fired or quits is not on you. He is responsible for his reaction, which was totally inappropriate.", "NTA.  Your coworker has some serious anger issues.", "NTA and your coworker doesn't sound well.", "lmao, NTA at all.  i'm also not sure what he's \"done\" with, lol.", "so maybe everyone gets the exact same order from now on?
