Yesterday, I was heating up my lunch while a team was distributing their lunch order from Chik-fil-A. One co-worker was confused because she had ordered a regular Chick-fil-A sandwich, and noticed that there were only spicy ones left. While she and another co-worker were looking over the receipt to confirm that the correct orders had been placed, a third co-worker walked up and asked what was going on. They informed him of the situation, and then he holds up his sandwich and comments that he had ordered a deluxe. I immediately noticed that he was holding a white sandwich wrapper, Chick-fil-A deluxe sandwiches always come in a box. So I realized he had accidentally grabbed her regular sandwich instead of grabbing his deluxe sandwich.\n\n\"Deluxe sandwiches always come in a box, regular sandwiches come in the white wrappers. You accidentally grabbed her lunch\"\n\nThe two women immediately laughed about the situation. The woman who was trying to help the one who had lost her lunch says \"You guys have got to start checking things before you just start grabbing food.\" I would like to clarify that she was not saying this in an angry tone.

The guy who grabbed the wrong lunch immediately crumples the wrapper and sandwich up in his hands and throws them across the room into the sink.

That\u2019s a wildly exaggerated response", "Violence. If you feel threatened send a note to HR, make sure the other 2 are on board, no one was angry at him, even if he was embarrassed that is not how you react", "NTA, and there was something seriously wrong with this man. Who throws a tantrum like that over a sandwich, and for his own mistake at that?", "So the atmosphere was joking? Everyone (except the sandwich grabber) was light hearted and teasing about it? No one was offended by the mistake and it was obvious no one was offended?  \n\nNTA.  That dude was clearly already on the edge. If something this insignificant causes that volatile of a reaction then something way bigger is in play.", "NTA\n\nThat reaction was completely out of line and was not your fault.", "NTA but if you\u2019re in America like me, I\u2019d watch that guy. That\u2019s not a normal reaction to have at your work place because you grabbed someone else\u2019s meal. He should have been apologizing, not throwing shit. Does he get the short end of the stick at work? or work in a position where he\u2019s dealing with coworkers in a negative way, like for example he\u2019s responsible for shipping orders and when one of his coworkers gets a call from an angry client about their order he gets bitched at?", "NTA - He screwed up and got called on it. Everyone there recognized it as trivial except the guy who apparently has so little humility that he can't just acknowledge he grabbed the wrong sandwich.", "NTA at all, but someone needs to report that guy to HR for seriously aggressive, inappropriate, potentially even threatening behaviour.\n\nPersonally, while he didn't directly threaten anyone, I would feel very unsafe around any adult who was so aggressive and completely unable to regulate his own emotions and behaviour in a professional setting that a friendly, joking reminder to double check which of the lunch orders he grabs before starting to eat (which is just common sense anyway) results in him ragefully throwing MULTIPLE whole, uneaten items of food across the room and storming out. That isn't just inappropriate, it's completely irrational and out of control. And I literally say that as a deeply sensitive autistic person who is easily overwhelmed; but if I was upset by something at work, I would quickly remove myself from the situation, and find somewhere quiet to calm down . . . not rage out and throw things. \n\nThis man needs to be reported. He could have hurt someone just throwing stuff around.

There is nothing wrong in pointing out an innocent mistake, especially so it doesn\u2019t happen again. Whether or not that man is fired or quits is not on you. He is responsible for his reaction, which was totally inappropriate.", "NTA.  Your coworker has some serious anger issues.", "NTA and your coworker doesn't sound well.", "lmao, NTA at all.  i'm also not sure what he's \"done\" with, lol.", "so maybe everyone gets the exact same order from now on?

I kept things vague to keep it not obvious, but let's just say HR was in the room", "100% no one was upset. The woman whose lunch was taken, hadn't said a word after I pointed out the sandwich was hers. The other woman even actively said she was joking as he stormed off.

That is inexcusable, in any environment!!", "Must have been a bit frightening, especially if this isn't baseline behavior for him.\n\nThe only other thing I can think to explain it is perhaps he is an actual narcissist.  They cannot tolerate being laughed at...not even the slightest bit. Still not your fault though. Totally his issue.", "They were all laughing about the situation after he stormed off because of how ridiculous this was", "Sounds like work is gonna be interesting for a while, lol.  Hopefully he apologizes for his unreasonable outburst.", "NTA, and something similar happened at my workplace. \n\nWe only have two microwaves and some dude (Larry) put his food in and then just left the break room. Minutes pass, the line was growing so the next person (Chill Guy) took his food out and set it on top of the microwave to start warming up their own food. Larry comes back, sees his food on top of the microwave, and instead of reacting like a normal person, takes the food currently in the microwave and THROWS IT ON THE FLOOR. \n\nThe food in question: Gumbo. \n\nHonestly a crime in itself in this area to waste gumbo.\n\nThe guy whose lunch got yeeted by Larry confronts him (Chill Guy is super chill and was literally just talking to Larry asking him wtf was going on with him), Larry then proceeds to YELL at him about never touching his food. (As if we're supposed to know it's his food dude left in the break room long enough that his stuff got moved from a microwave).\n\n Annnnnywaaaay, Larry for sure got fired that day...", "NTA report him to HR this behavior is what disgruntled employees  do.  You know how that turns up at times..", "NTA. A lot of people nowadays seem to be incapable of admitting they have made a mistake, or are wrong about something. They feel like an error being pointed out is a personal attack on them when we all make mistakes, and they use anger or deflection as a defense mechanism. This guy needs to understand he's not perfect.", "Yikes!", "NTA\n\nHis emotional dysregulation is not your problem. This is also a huge red flag. You may not feel unsafe but he needs to be put on a workplace PIP (barring something going on in his personal life where he is under some stress but then is willing to apologize to everyone in the room-- so long as he doesn't pull that shit again.)\n\n\nAdult toddlers escalate very easily. Just be aware.", "I wonder if there were past instances of lunch mistakes.\n  \nI'm not taking his side, but I've seen similar behavior when it comes to company-provided lunches.\n  \nMostly when someone pipes up, \"I can't eat the lunch provided, are there other options?\"\n  \nSeriously, my boss doesn't even bother to hide his eye rolls anymore when I ask about the \"free lunch.\" I know it's a free lunch, and I'm grateful they consider us. I just want to know what it is so I know whether or not I can eat it or if I should figure out my own lunch.", "Ugh we have a guy like this at work. A woman barely says something to question him jokingly \"I'm sorry but that confused me ahahahahaha\" WHAT ARE YOU SAYING I CAN'T EXPLAIN THIS? WHY ARE YOU GIVING ATTITUDE.\n\nIts like you can't say its exist cause its all these tiny little events one by one but when you get to know the pattern you realise the guy only does it to women."]}
