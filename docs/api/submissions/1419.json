She was hospitalized six months ago with heart issues and upon released, I cut back on work hours to care for her. I live about a half hour away and have been staying with her for 3-4 days a week, cleaning her house, taking out her trash, cooking for her, taking her to appointments, shopping, caring for her dog. She can no longer drive so I have pretty much taken over her care. She is not always pleasant to me, entitled, and sometimes nasty.\n\nTwo days ago I got an email in my inbox and wasn't sure what it was. My mother had used my information as backup to retrieve passwords. Yes, I changed the password and then realized it was her email. The one at the top drew my attention. Yes I read it. She was writing to a friend trashing me, everything about me, saying I don't do enough for her, that I don't do anything right. She attacked every single thing about me. Her friend wrote back saying that I seemed to have \"issues\", leaving me to believe this tirade has been going for a while. I am not perfect but I have been very good to her, not abusive in any way. She doesn't have dementia, no cognitive issues. I am extremely hurt. I have been the punching bag for a long time with her. If I leave her, she has no one else. She is absolutely not open to discussion, has never apologized to anything in her life for anything.

She has food, medicine, is mobile, can perform all self care. \n\nIf I leave her and do not continue caring for her, she will be alone.

Perhaps come up with a few options for her and phone numbers, etc to give her if you don't want to set up anything yourself. You certainly aren't obligated to even do that, but given she is your mom, I'm sure it would be even more difficult for you to not know she will be ok without you.", "NTA.  Don't abandon her.  Just tell her that you can't do it anymore, that you get too tired and you have to go back to work.  Give her a deadline (like two weeks) and stick to it. Help her less every day.  She will need to get help.  Put her in touch with some agencies that can help if she can't afford to pay.  Then STOP helping her.\n\nShe will figure it out, or she won't.  It is not on you.  You don't have to take care of her.  It doesn't have to be an angry thing.  Don't do it any more.\n\nYou helped her during the crisis.  You jumped in and helped.  What you did was amazing.  But you can't keep this up forever.\n\nBelieve it or not, it is not your job.  And don't do it during the next crisis.", "NTA. All you should do is print the email, hand it to her and say, \u201cI\u2019m done. You might want to call for a home health aid to come help you.\u201d Then...walk out. Mom can get groceries delivered. Mom can get meals on wheels. Mom can get assistance. There are options. And if she can\u2019t...she can check herself into a nursing home. This behavior is not ok unless she has dementia and isn\u2019t thinking right."]}
