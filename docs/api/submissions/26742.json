(thats my point of view at least)\r  \n\r  \nmy sister kept complaining about not seeing him anymore. she made this whole drama movie where she cried and thought he died. \n\nwe were hanging out with some friends and she started to tell the same story again, pretending to cry and basically fishing for validation... i snapped. i told her that he is a human being and that what she was doing was wrong. i told her what i did and i told her that she was more than capable of changing the man's life if she wanted but instead she was playing games. i told her that life is not a game and that she should grow up. i told her that she is disconnected from reality and is in severe need of a reality check.\r  \n\r  \ni feel bad. but i think im in the right. what do you think reddit?", "created_utc": 1694541175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gy2xw/aita_for_taking_away_my_sisters_favorite_homeless/", "score": 426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She absolutely used him for her own enjoyment like a pet. You tried to get through to her and she didn't listen. It's good that you stepped in.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to ask really.", "NTA. If she actually cared for/wanted to help him, she was capable of doing exactly what you did. She just wanted clout.", "NTA you actually helped him. She was....I'm not sure what she was doing. Not helping him, that's for sure.", "&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"the hostess declined him access and told her he \"is in violation of their dress code\" and that's fucked up i know, \" .. there is NOTHING fucked up in this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour sister was an AH - not willing to help but much into virtue signalling, and you actually helped him.", "NTA- you turned a man's life around. Don't ever apologize for that.", "Nta, honestly if I could fist bump you I would, because you are correct she was not only treating him like a hamster but also using him to get praises  from y'alls parents, because she could have done what you did with in the first day of meeting him or, she could have asked you for a idea on how to help him properly, because for all she new he could have been drinking, drugs or gambling that money away make his life worse on himself, but she didn't care she wanted to be praised.", "NTA. It\u2019s known as Lady Bountiful Syndrome", "Your sister sounds unbelievably gross. NTA", "NTA.Thank you for doing this .\nOnce you are homeless everything is just that much harder \u2014I worked with drug addicts .When I asked how they funded their habits many said \u201c Begging\u201d. \nFor that reason I rarely hand money out to people at street corners .IMO it\u2019s better to fund the places handing out meals,providing transitional housing etc..Some people refuse that housing for various reasons but for me supporting those  shelters is the best way to try and help .", "It sounds like you gave much more assistance to the person than she did to me. NTA.", "NTA. It's equivalent to doimg something for soempne then posting a selfie on social media\n\nYou actually helped him. Gave him the tools he needed to get his life together rather than using money to just keep him around.", "NTA. Your sister is who \u2018eat the rich\u2019 is talking about. Did she ever even learn his name? How she was treating him was disgusting. \n\nI will say that I appreciate that you actually helped him. People who are homeless are often stuck in a cycle. We need money(shelter) the be presentable and we need to be presentable to get (and keep) a job. Thank you for what you did. I truly hope things get better for him.", "You honestly believe you've changed his life? Take a look at the research on what it takes to actually, meaningful, change these ppls lives. A hotel and some job training is a drop in the bucket. You are both treating him as a thing as opposed to a person and both to self righteous to see it. \n\nYou are seeking the same validation of your actions that your sister was and it is just as grotesque. Do you honestly believe that by doing so little a year from now he's not gonna be back on the street? If helping these ppl was so easy no one would be homeless. \n\nI guarantee you he's been in touch with many charities before, that he's been assessed for job skills. Long term homeless ppl are homeless for far more complicated reasons - usually involving drugs, alcohol or mental health. The likely good of him being capable of holding down a job without first undergoing intensive psychiatric treatment is minimal. Without income he won't be able to pay for housing and if he has a substance issue on top of this any income he manages to scrap together will be gone.\n\nYou helped this man to prove a point. The point you proved is that you know as little about the issue as your sister. Bringing a homemade meal each day and sitting down to have a chat is more beneficial long term than what either of you did. Try donating shampoo (most homeless ppl hate that it forces them to have dirty hair) or just stopping for a coffee and chat.", "ESH. You seem more interested in showing up your younger sister rather than teaching her. She wanted to help, she wasn\u2019t going about it the right way, you should have guided her.", "YTA, you couldn\u2019t tell your sister what you had done before, and that he wasn\u2019t dead?? I don\u2019t see anything in the post that suggests she didn\u2019t legitimately care for the guy. If you had told her you helped him and she was upset that you had, it\u2019d be another story.", "NTA. \nShe was acting that way. \nYou did the help that actually benefited him. Your sister just threw money at him and treated him like you described.", "NTA. You did what was suppose to be done. Perfect.", "NTA. \n\n\nHomeless people are humans too, not some property that can be \"taken away\"", "NTA, you\u2019re 100% right and your sister sounds so incredibly childish.", "Your sister could have cleaned him up before trying to take him to the restraunt, but no. Sad really.", "Yuuuup.  The story of probably the biggest help I've provided to a person, I've only told it to one person.  I don't want praise for it, the act alone makes me feel good and humbles me when I think of it, and it serves as a reminder to continue to help out others.  Opie truly helped that man, I personally am thankful they did all of that for him.  I imagine he would appreciate a fancy meal, but wouldn't it be more beneficial to spend the money on providing several meals worth of food vs one fine dining experience, that ended up in him being rejected (and likely embarrassed and/or humiliated)?  OP's sister really missed the mark, hopefully she realizes the ways she can truly help those in need of assistance.", "This kind of reminds me of a story about a dog that was given a big piece of steak for rescuing a young child from a river.\n\nThe dog learned that if it brought a child from the river, it would get steak. But there wasnt' always a child to rescue when it was hungry.\n\nSo... it would knock children into the river, and then rescue them... and get steak.  Until the humans learned what it was doing.\n\nYour sister is kind of like that dog.  She wasn't helping him.  She was treating him like a pet, at best... because she learned that is she gives the homeless guy treats, she gets praise.  NTA for actually helping the guy and calling your sister out on her behaviour.", "Actually, there was just a study published that said that giving large sums of money to homeless people did far more to end homelessness that supporting many programs.\nI was out of Vancouver I believe. The author of the study had gotten a PhD at an Ivy league school, but faced homelessness for a while.", "NTA, you helped turn a homeless person's life around!", "NTA  \n\n\nYour sister was looking to better her own image in front of herself, not to really help a man - which is precisely what you did. You were completely in the right to step in, and thankfully you did and also in such a great way. You should talk to your parents to maybe send your sister on a bit of an \"education\" trip with some massively cut allowance and real work to earn some money on her own to prove herself.", "NTA and your sister is lucky this guy wasn't dangerous. You helped him when she wanted his attention more then actually helping him.", "NTA.  \nShe was making herself feel good, you actually helped him. It's the old \"Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach him to fish, he eats every day.\"", "\"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\"\n\nYour sister was using her money and power dynamic to keep him tied to her like a pet. You've given him the ability to make his own money and his own choices. NTA", "How do you people believe this shit", "There's one quote that comes to mind, I think it might be from the bible? Idk. But it goes something like \"when you give, let not your right hand see what your left hand is doing, so your charity may remain a secret\"\n\nBasically, if you're bragging about your charity, it isn't really charity anymore. That goes double for your sister as she wasn't actually helping the guy. You did the right thing. NTA", "Reminds me of an early Kardashian episode when they gave a makeover to a homeless man. They treated him like a doll.", "nta", "NTA, you helped the guy by teaching him to fish.", "INFO \nWhy can\u2019t she see him anymore", "I get this vibe. OP wants to feel morally superior, but is only \"helping\" to one-up the sister.", "Who would bring a homeless man to a fancy restaurant ? I do not know not one person that doesn\u2019t know that high end restaurants have a dress code. She knew damn well he wasn\u2019t getting in, she could have at least cleaned him up. If she really cared for him she would have helped him like OP did !", "There's a scene in Terry Pratchett's Hogfather where a king decides to more or less act like OP's sister. He gathers up all his table scraps from a big feast, finds some random poor man's house and tries to \"gift\" the stuff but the poor man doesn't want it. He's never had goose and duck and king's food to have a taste for it. He just wants his beans but he's terrified to offend the king.", "Yeah, looking back on it, I think I probably should have gone ESH. I read the sister as more immature and stupid than callous and calculating. And in that case, if her being upset at his disappearance wasn\u2019t performative, than OP not telling her he was safe right away bothered me enough that I think OP was wrong as well. Without that fact, my opinion would be NTA."]}
