I don't remember the conversation since I have been trying to forget about it. Anyway, she said:\n\nMom: \"why am I getting mad at this game? It's dumb to get mad on things like this\" and other things that started to anger me more and more.\n\nMe: \"That's why everyone is getting mad because of you.\"\n\nMom: \"Oh, Really?\" With an annoying tone.\n\nMe:\"Yes, Me, Dad, my brother all the time\"\n\nShe then started to compare me to my brother who did some stuff in the past too which were bad, but I rather not say what he did.\n\nThen I remained silent. When I get frustrated I always end up crying, I can't control it at all. When she saw me crying:\n\nMom: Oooh? You are crying? She then started to make those sobbing noises which made me get angrier.\n\nMe: It would've been better if women didn't have- and my dad stopped me from saying it.\n\nI kept playing a little until she was saying something. I ignoring her so I couldn't hear what she said.\n\nI went downstairs and vented a lot and decided to not to talk with her or help her at anything or even have an eye contact.\n\nWhen she was telling me something, I didn't answer. When I said Good night once, I only said to my dad, she said good night and I answered \"I didn't say it to you\" and she answered \"What did you said?\"\n\nNow from the present day, I was still ignoring her. I was playing the same game again without getting mad (got better items). Both my mom and dad were getting ready to sleep and she said:\n\nMom: \"How much you have left there?\"\n\nMe: \"Stays silent\"\n\nMom: \"You are staying up for too much (it is 11PM) and you have school tomorrow\"\n\nMe: \"Still says silent\"\n\nMom: \"For acting tough, you will see that computer broken one day\"\n\nMe: \"Remains silent\"\n\nShe then went to sleep, my dad has a problem at his toe and the nail is pushing his flesh or it's inside. Ingrown nail, I don't know exactly. Whatever, a few minutes passed until she said:\n\nMom: OP turn on the lights, hurry. Your dad's toe is inflamed. Look!\n\nBecause I heard this, I turned them on. Looked at his toe and see it. But it was a prank and she caught my hand while giggling she said:\n\nMom: \"Come on, let me hug you!\"\n\nI refused and she went silent. After I said:\n\nMe: \"I expected you will say something other than this\"\n\nI expected her to say \"I am sorry because [...]\". I then kept playing and after I finished I turned off the computer. I heard her crying and I didn't cared about it, after leaving the room I said \"Good night, Dad\" and that's all the story.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nAnswer: YTA", "created_utc": 1667252999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiq0no/aita_that_ive_been_ignoring_my_mom_because_she/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
