You already made sure he knew why.  He just doesn't care.

Birthdays were not a big milestone for her family. \n\nShe's still my BFF even though she forgot to say anything this last week to me. I've learned to treat myself on my birthday and have zero expectations of others because life is short, and to me, it's not worth the stress.

I was upset, he apologised and we moved on. \n\nBirthdays are HARD for me, due to difficult family relationships and a turbulent life previous. I made it a point to tell him how hard it is, and that all I want is attention and effort - something to show me that you\u2019ve given it thought. \n\nMonths prior to my bday this year, I tell him straight out: A card, home made dinner, a thoughtful gift. Just something. \n\n4 days before my bd he gifts me a gift that is basically for our shared home, not for me. It was wrapped in leftover wrapping from my gift to him on his bd.\n\nThe day comes. Not a card, not a dinner or cake. No planned activity. Just a \u201chappy birthday\u201d. \n\nI took it up on my self and took us out to dinner. I paid. He wanted to leave early.\n\nI got upset and he then said \u201cshit I didn\u2019t realise\u201d. Now I\u2019m giving him the cold shoulder. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You deserve better.  Time to make him an ex and move on.", "NTA, and you can expect this level of effort from him anytime something is important to you. You deserve better.", "This reminds me of my husband. Whenever it was my birthday he would say, so what do you want to do? Where do you want to go? I wanted him to surprise me, to take me somewhere he thought about. But he never did. So after some years when he would ask, I would say, nowhere. I would rather be home than plan my own birthday.", "What's with people giving the gifts days early? I read this on the mother's day aita threads. Tons of their people gave them gifts 2-3 days before the special day.\n\nIt doesn't seem to prolong the celebration. Feels like it fizzles out really fast. NTA, he sucks.", "NTA. And I\u2019m sad you\u2019re even asking. There\u2019s a point when if someone gaslights you enough, that you start to gaslight yourself. Your emotions are valid! \n\n\u2014 sincerely, a woman with similar experiences", "NTA. What are his redeeming qualities?", "ESH He sucks but the silent treatment is just passive aggressiveness which is hands down the worst form of communication and doesn\u2019t deserve a response.", "I reacted similarly after my now-husband didn\u2019t even *wish* me a happy birthday the first year until 5pm, when he showed up late for dinner. I share that to explain I get the frustration. \n\nBut ESH. \n\nHe ignored your reasonable request and clear communication. But the silent treatment is ridiculous.
