We also have fake lego here. It has the same quality, only the word lego is not on all the tiny dots. You put it in the title and description, she didn't read. You are not a store, so you don't have a 30-day refund policy. You are in your rights to refuse.\nYou COULD refund her, and put the item on marketplace again, but the word 'demanding' is key imho.
