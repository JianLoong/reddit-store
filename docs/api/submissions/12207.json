A few days ago Rachel had asked my wife to babysit for a few hours, which my wife agreed but had told her she had to take their father to an appointment later that day. As time approached for my wife to go, Rachel texted and said her client for work was late and the meeting was going to take longer and asked if I could watch the baby while my wife goes to her appointment, I agreed.\n\nIt came time to change my nephew and he didn\u2019t have any diapers left in his bag, so I just used one of our sons. I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d make a difference, but I was wrong. After my SIL picked up my nephew and brought him home I was getting spam of text about how my nephew now has a rash, because I put him in the wrong diapers. I tried to explain it was because he was out of diapers and she should\u2019ve packed enough, but then she argued and said I should\u2019ve texted her before putting him in a random diaper. She complained to my wife and when my wife defended me, it caused a big argument between the sisters and Rachel called us \u201ccareless parents.\u201d\n\nI feel horrible because obviously I didn\u2019t mean to give the kid a rash, but how was I suppose to know it would?

I\u2019m also willing to bet that at no point did she ban you from using other diapers. \n\nBut, and you know this, raising a baby is hard. She\u2019s also working.

She should have left enough for the expected time *plus an extra or two* since she extended the time you were watching him.\n\nNow that you know, I'm sure it won't be an issue in the future.

I understand kids can have allergies, but if it wasn't mentioned and I had no other options, I would do the same thing. Diaper rash isn't usually a huge deal if you notice quick enough. A little cream, and 9 times outta ten it would be gone in a few hours.\n\n Last summer, we took my daughter into a local lake and something gave her a nasty rash. But with a little baby butt paste she was fine within days. Still don't know what irritated her, but kids can sensitive to weird things.

My kiddo was *extremely* allergic to Huggies, which (if you're from elsewhere) is one of (if not THE) biggest brands.\n\nI was always extra careful to pack extra diapers, but as you said, this was a \"something came up\", rather than a failure to provide enough in the first place. \n\nDo I think she should have packed more? Sure. But most new parents don't know to do this until... well... they learn the lesson by not having enough. This was her lesson. Not knowing doesn't make her an AH, and I understand being upset about the rash.\n\nDid you do anything wrong? Not at all. Even if you had called her, baby would have needed a diaper. Leaving him in the dirty one would have also caused a rash. Leaving him without would almost certainly have destroyed your entire home (I'm not being sarcastic, babies with outie equipment wreak havoc when undiapered.) So something would have needed to cover his bottom. All you had was your own diapers. And you had no knowledge of this issue, which isn't super common knowledge. So I don't think you were the AH, and I think you handled it sensibly.\n\nThen we come to the spam texts...\n\nShe informed you of the problem, which was good.\n\nYou attempted to explain, which was good.\n\nAnd then you made an oopsie. \n\n>because he was out of diapers and **she should\u2019ve packed enough**\n\nIt's rarely... no... it's *never* a good idea to tell another parent what they should have done as a parent. It puts people on the defensive. Was it an AH move? In this case, I don't think so... she'd implied the rash was your fault, you were probably confused and a little defensive as well.\n\n>then she argued and said I should\u2019ve texted her before putting him in a random diaper.\n\nThat's nonsense. As we covered above, you had no reason to suspect there would be a problem with the diaper you used. But it's not really an AH thing to say, it's not really an attack on you, and she was already on the defensive, so... \n\n>She complained to my wife\n\nThis makes sense. Rather than argue, she went to her sister, who presumably knew about the diaper issue.\n\n>when my wife defended me\n\nAs she should have, so no AH here...\n\n>it caused a big argument between the sisters\n\nYes. Because neither of you had done anything *wrong* up until this point. Your wife was defending you because she was talking to her sister. Sis can give her own pov, and you can't. \n\nBut to Rachel it would have felt like your wife defending you was your wife siding with you. And since what *you* had said was essentially that she should have made a different parenting choice... it would have read like your wife was criticizing her as a parent.\n\nWhich I'm sure she wasn't. So no AHs here, just a difference in needs and perspectives.\n\n>and Rachel called us \u201ccareless parents.\u201d\n\nBecause from Rachel's POV, that's what you'd called her. Should she have said it? No. Was it an AH move? I don't think so. I think most people would have reacted similarly. It was wrong, but understandable.\n\n>I feel horrible because obviously I didn\u2019t mean to give the kid a rash\n\nDon't. It's a diaper rash. Toss a bit of cornstarch in there, and baby feels no pain, and the rash is gone in no time. No lasting harm done.\n\n...\n\nOverall, I don't think anyone was an AH, just that it could have been handled better. \n\n\"OMG little Nephew has a rash cause you put the wrong diaper on!!!\"\n\n\"Oh no, that's awful. He was out and I used one of mine... Does he have an allergy or something?\"\n\n\"YES AND YOU SHOULD HAVE TEXTED ME 1ST!11!\"\n\n\"I didn't think to do that. If it comes up again I sure will. Do you need some rash ointment, or have you got some already?\"\n\n... argument averted? idk. Conversations are always easier in hindsight, with time to plan them out, lol.\n\nYour nephew is fine. Your SIL will get over it. No lasting harm done!", "Yeah, I'm confused by this... I don't think my diaper bag ever had fewer than six diapers and two changes of clothes in it - I was basically told 'plan to be out a full day every time you leave the house' and packed accordingly. Yes, I had the money to not ration diapers, but come on - if you know your kid needs something special, you plan for that ...", "Right? What was OP supposed to do, leave the kid in a dirty diaper?", "This, plus a rash would have also happened if OP had left his nephew in a dirty nappy and she'd be upset about that as well.\n\nAlso SIL *never even told OP or his wife* about her son's need for special nappies due to allergies/sensitivity. How were they supposed to know if they aren't told? They aren't mind readers ffs.", "At my preschool if a baby runs out of diapers we try to use the same brand on them. It's usually a different aesthetic design or size but i havent seen any rashes forming due to the change. Altho, off topic, one of our babies has formed rashes with diapers since being a newborn to the point of developing  a huge cyst/pimple that had to be lanced by a doctor", "Not all diapers have the brand name printed on them either. If it's a brand OP is unfamiliar with he likely wouldn't have known which it was anyway", "Well, I guess it's better than using your nephew's diaper for your kid's next arts and crafts project.", "This was my exact thought reading this. Even worse, I\u2019m guessing OP didn\u2019t even notice until said shitty diaper was already off and nephew was cleaned and he\u2019s getting ready to put on a new diaper, only to discover there isn\u2019t any new ones. I guess SIL believes he should have either:\n\n1) left baby commando while OP takes both babies to the store? Or,\n\n2) put shitty diaper back on nephew so he could take him to the store?\n\nBoth options are pure insanity and #2 definitely going to lead to a much worse rash while #1 means basically a 100% chance of an accident somewhere.", "Yeah - I've been around the block with diaper rash and reactions to specific brands of diapers (and diaper creams - I still have Desitin flashbacks). Can confirm that a baby sitting in a dirty diaper is going to result in a *way* worse rash than the wrong brand of diaper. The onus is totally on the parents to notify caregivers about any allergies (and provide enough diapers!).", "And if he was allergic to a specific brand, she should've mentioned this. Next time she asks them to babysit, OP and his wife should just say, \"Obviously you can't trust us since the diaper incident where you failed to pack enough diapers. You'll have to find someone else.\" NTA", "She should have packed enough for the planned time of baby sitting, and then some extras. Little monsters think it\u2019s funny to pee before you even get the new diaper on them.", "Some kids have massive issues with one type of diaper vs another, so it very much is a thing, but the worse situation would be sitting in a dirty diaper of the preferred kind. OP had no choice but to change the kid. The kid's mom wants to blame someone other than herself for not packing enough.", "My son reacted poorly to pampers and would get really bad rashes from them. It\u2019s a thing for some babies. I could only put my son in Huggies. OP is still NTA. It\u2019s like any other allergy or sensitivity. You need a sitter, you provide for the child\u2019s needs and you tell the sitter about those needs. Expecting that someone would know to use specific brand without being told is stupid and entitled.", "I don't have kids but when I babysit for friends' children they come over with bags and bags of stuff for nearly every contingency.  Sometimes I question if these parents are coming back for their children! (kidding)\n\nI understand that they are probably privileged to be have that much stuff on hand but I suspect that if they didn't and I had to improvise, I wouldn't get a lecture about how I diapered their child in a pinch.", "Like, if the wrong diaper leaves a rash, what did mom think sitting in a diaper full of pee and poop was gonna do?", "I feel like it's less the actual switching and more the different diaper itself. Either the material irritates them, its sized differently so it runs the skin more, etc. I can tell you pampers give my son a mild rash but every other brand I've tried has been fine. \n\nThat poor baby! I've heard cloth diapers can be great for babies whose bottoms dont agree with disposables", "It\u2019s very unlikely OP had the car seats necessary so going to the store was completely not an option anyway. OP did the best they could and it\u2019s the mom\u2019s fault for not being prepared for what her child would need.", "haha so true", "Uh, no, you wouldn't. It would never OCCUR to me to berate someone who helped me out in a pinch - because the fact that they needed to would mean that a) something has gone horribly wrong, and I was grateful, or b) I'd somehow mucked up by not providing what was necessary and they pulled my butt out of the fire and I was grateful or c) something totally unexpected happened and they coped with it for me and I was grateful.\n\nSee the theme there?", "Yeah I thought about that as well", "NTA. If he had a rash and needed to use \u201cspecial diapers\u201d then it was her responsibility to 1) make sure enough were packed and 2) tell your wife and yourself the kid can only use the \u201cspecial diapers.\u201d She did neither. She has no one to blame but herself.", "NTA your sil didn\u2019t plan accordingly and you did what anyone with common sense would do. I babysit for my cousin who is a single mom on a tight budget & she always overpacks because you never know when she might run late.", "NTA\n\nEven if you had texted her, what could have possibly done with a soiled nappy and a half naked baby?\n\nHe won't die of diaper rash.", "I would ask, what would she have told you to do? If you texted your SL about no diapers would she have expected to you take all the kids to the store to get his normal brand? Not happening. No wait. You should have picked one off the diaper tree in the back yard. Your SIL is nuts. She under packs the diaper bag and you are careless? Well, now you can say no to any more free babysitting. You and your wife are careless parents according to your SIL. You are not worthy to watch your nephew ever again. Lol", "NTA. \n\nKid one we had to use cloth diapers with. Along with rash creams that absolutely ruined them. (Hooray for medical conditions /s) we could use any sort of unscented baby wipes most of the time, and sometimes it was the dry method of cloth baby wipes. \n\nKid two we could play musical diaper brands with. Zero rashes. Like ever. It was a the good kind of freaky. We could use whatever baby wipe on this kiddo although we still defaulted back to the cheap unscented wipes out of habit. \n\nKid three is a little bougie butt and we can only use pampers, and water wipes. And we have to use aquaphore with every diaper change to prevent a rash too because again with the medical issues. \n\nEither way, dude, you had no way of knowing. No one told you. They didn\u2019t pack enough diapers. And you being a responsible adult changed the baby\u2019s diaper. Kid will be fine in a few days and you\u2019ll know going forward.", "NTA. \"Careless parents\" is projecting.", "NTA. Dude when you're caring for infants you do the best thing you can at the moment. I'd have done the exact same thing as you because I would have expected mom to disclose any and all allergies if the baby had any and would have assumed it was safe for him as well.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You took care of the baby and ensured he had a clean dry diaper. Now you know that he's allergic to your brand though.\n\nI'd personally ask her what brand of diapers she actually uses and ask she packs extras next time she needs a sitter in other people's house because this is a common issue and solution to shortages of diapers in every household. If he's that sensitive she should have told you before leaving the baby with you.\n You did nothing wrong op. Her lack of communication isn't your fault.", "NTA. You did her a favour. Most people wouldn\u2019t have been so petty over 1 diaper to let her know it advance. They would do what you did and not bother her over something so small\u2026", "NTA. She should have packed appropriately (should have over packed diapers if her son has an allergy issue and can only use a certain brand) and you did the best you could with what you had. You weren't malicious and it obviously wasn't intentional.", "NTA. Let her know you and your wife are closed for babysitting services in the future.", "NTA. I'm not a parent so I could be totally wrong, but I feel like unless you've personally dealt with this or know someone who has(even still), I don't think anyone would think about a different diaper causing a problem.", "NTA.  She should've been better prepared.", "NTA", "NTA. Either she's an overprotective paranoid mom or your nephew has some kind of allergy. In either case it's on her to pack enough of his diapers for you. In the second case SHE is the one being careless- babysitters need to know about allergies! Especially family, who are presumably going to be around the kid a lot!", "NTA.  That would be the end of me watching the kid until I got a sincere apology. I have 4 kids and wouldve done the same thing.  You didn't know and did your best.", "Oh, but if OP had texted her, she would have told him to go out to the store to buy the right kind of diapers!  With three babies in tow.", "Same with my 2.

This is all on her.", "NTA\n\nI had to use special diapers and so did my brother. In his bad he had like 30 for an afternoon away just in case. She should have planned better.\n\nAlso, were you supposed to just let the child be diaperless?", "NTA", ">It came time to change my nephew and *he didn\u2019t have any diapers left in his bag*, so I just used one of our sons\n\nNTA.\n\nLike literally, *what were you supposed to do?* contacting Rachel wouldn't have done any good because she was in a meeting, wasn't she?\n\nWell, wasn't she?\n\nBecause maybe she wasn't, and she was just using you guys as free babysitting.", "She sounds like an asshole", "NTA. If her kid has such sensitive skin, she should make sure that there are plenty of his diapers when other people will be watching him. I wouldn't think twice about putting my son's diapers on my niece, especially if I didn't know that she wears special diapers. Were you supposed to let the baby go diaper-less and pee or poop all over?", "NTA! You did what any reasonable person would do. She should be apologizing for not packing enough diapers for her kid.", "NTA. You know how you solve this? Don't watch your nephew anymore. You're welcome", "NTA, but maybe telling her she should have packed more was a slight dick move because that puts her on the defensive and she's probably embarrassed. You're not wrong at all, and saying it isn't necessarily a BAD thing, but time and place I guess? Idk. Hopefully this blows over and you can all laugh about it in a few months.", "Failing to provide enough of the magic diapers that are the only ones her kid's tender little butt can tolerate... doesn't exactly scream \"careful parent\" to me.  In fact this whole scenario sounds like she's a bit on the flaky side.  Given that you can't realistically be expected to conjure up a pack of Luvs with no notice when you're in a Kirkland bulk brand diaper house, and the baby usually doesn't like sitting in their own filth, you're totally NTA.", "NAH you couldn\u2019t have known and she didn\u2019t expect to run out.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of crazy head gets mad at this?", "NTA\n\nThey should have had extra diapers for the child. You did the right thing. Sounds like your wife needs to go low/no contact with her ass of a sister.", "Nta. She sounds like she would have complained no matter what you did. She didn't plan ahead or inform you of any allergies. Her lack of planning and forethought don't give her a right to complain when you made what you thought was the best decision at the time. She needs to get a grip. A more proper response would be to say thank you and then explained the rash and allergy while taking ownership over their fuck up with poor planning and communication. You can feel bad for your nephew suffering, but you didn't intentionally do anything wrong, and SiL has nobody to blame but herself if she feels so strongly about placing blame.", "NTA it's not so much special diapers it's just some babies are sensitive. My son could do pampers, Huggies, mama bear(amazon) or sam's club. Luvs or other brands make him rash. My daughter can wear any diaper no rash\n\nFlip that script. SIL is a careless parent for not packing enough diapers. If her diaper bag wasn't bursting with diapers then it's on her. You never know when it's a shit day. When a baby is bazooka-ing shit like it's the cold war you know if you leave the house be prepared. My son had 3 blow outs in one day And my folly was diapers yes. But I had only packed one set of spare clothes.", "NTA she should have warned both you and your wife about this. From personal experience my middle child broke out in rashes from some of the off-hand diapers. Seriously this is part trial and error. If you had known you could have at the very least used diaper ointment to prevent in case you ran out. Sometimes babies will use more then you know. I can forgive that oversight because yes Sometimes kids use more diapers. But to shame and yell at you because she did not let you know ahead of time was stupid at best.", "NTA.

I either packed a crapload of nappies and warned sitters/childcare not to use substitutes, or I dealt with the consequences of my own bad planning.\n\nDid I tell off the childcare centre when they didn't bother to look in youngest's drawer and instead used the communal nappy supply? Yes. Would I complain at a last-minute sitter because I didn't provide enough nappies and they made the logical choice of using what *was* available? Ahhh no they would've been doing me a favour WTF?", "Yeah, I don't understand what SIL expected.  She failed to provide enough diapers, she wasn't able to get away from work, and her kid needed to be changed. What was the alternative to OP using one if his baby's diapers? Leaving nephew in a soiled diaper?", "It wasn't even a mistake. It was the only option. Leaving the baby in a dirty diaper would have been cruel, not to mention also likely to cause a rash. The SIL is an idiot.", "Same thing. I always pack lots of diapers, wet wipes, clothes, formula, bottles, bibs, etc. I even pack extra socks and one time, I actually did have to use them. When you have a baby, you have to be prepared for everything, always.

I ended up needing it, lol. You just never know.", "So true! My son fell in the water while we were at the beach and his hat got wet. I had forgotten to pack the other one and my mom actually managed to wrap her beach scarf around his head \ud83d\ude02 So, yes, it's good to be prepared for anything.", "My oldest could only use Pampers, youngest could only use Huggies.
