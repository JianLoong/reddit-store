We have two children together ages 3, and 6 months. My wife has a sister Rachel26f who has also has a baby a few weeks apart from our youngest. A few days ago Rachel had asked my wife to babysit for a few hours, which my wife agreed but had told her she had to take their father to an appointment later that day. As time approached for my wife to go, Rachel texted and said her client for work was late and the meeting was going to take longer and asked if I could watch the baby while my wife goes to her appointment, I agreed.\n\nIt came time to change my nephew and he didn\u2019t have any diapers left in his bag, so I just used one of our sons. I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d make a difference, but I was wrong. After my SIL picked up my nephew and brought him home I was getting spam of text about how my nephew now has a rash, because I put him in the wrong diapers. I tried to explain it was because he was out of diapers and she should\u2019ve packed enough, but then she argued and said I should\u2019ve texted her before putting him in a random diaper. She complained to my wife and when my wife defended me, it caused a big argument between the sisters and Rachel called us \u201ccareless parents.\u201d\n\nI feel horrible because obviously I didn\u2019t mean to give the kid a rash, but how was I suppose to know it would?

I\u2019m also willing to bet that at no point did she ban you from using other diapers. \n\nBut, and you know this, raising a baby is hard. She\u2019s also working.

I understand kids can have allergies, but if it wasn't mentioned and I had no other options, I would do the same thing. Diaper rash isn't usually a huge deal if you notice quick enough.

My kiddo was *extremely* allergic to Huggies, which (if you're from elsewhere) is one of (if not THE) biggest brands.\n\nI was always extra careful to pack extra diapers, but as you said, this was a \"something came up\", rather than a failure to provide enough in the first place. \n\nDo I think she should have packed more? Sure. But most new parents don't know to do this until... well... they learn the lesson by not having enough. This was her lesson. Not knowing doesn't make her an AH, and I understand being upset about the rash.\n\nDid you do anything wrong? Not at all. Even if you had called her, baby would have needed a diaper. Leaving him in the dirty one would have also caused a rash. Leaving him without would almost certainly have destroyed your entire home (I'm not being sarcastic, babies with outie equipment wreak havoc when undiapered.) So something would have needed to cover his bottom. All you had was your own diapers. And you had no knowledge of this issue, which isn't super common knowledge. So I don't think you were the AH, and I think you handled it sensibly.\n\nThen we come to the spam texts...\n\nShe informed you of the problem, which was good.\n\nYou attempted to explain, which was good.\n\nAnd then you made an oopsie. \n\n>because he was out of diapers and **she should\u2019ve packed enough**\n\nIt's rarely... no... it's *never* a good idea to tell another parent what they should have done as a parent. It puts people on the defensive. Was it an AH move? In this case, I don't think so... she'd implied the rash was your fault, you were probably confused and a little defensive as well.\n\n>then she argued and said I should\u2019ve texted her before putting him in a random diaper.\n\nThat's nonsense. As we covered above, you had no reason to suspect there would be a problem with the diaper you used. But it's not really an AH thing to say, it's not really an attack on you, and she was already on the defensive, so... \n\n>She complained to my wife\n\nThis makes sense. Rather than argue, she went to her sister, who presumably knew about the diaper issue.\n\n>when my wife defended me\n\nAs she should have, so no AH here...\n\n>it caused a big argument between the sisters\n\nYes. Because neither of you had done anything *wrong* up until this point. Your wife was defending you because she was talking to her sister. Sis can give her own pov, and you can't. \n\nBut to Rachel it would have felt like your wife defending you was your wife siding with you. And since what *you* had said was essentially that she should have made a different parenting choice... it would have read like your wife was criticizing her as a parent.\n\nWhich I'm sure she wasn't. So no AHs here, just a difference in needs and perspectives.\n\n>and Rachel called us \u201ccareless parents.\u201d\n\nBecause from Rachel's POV, that's what you'd called her. Should she have said it? No. Was it an AH move? I don't think so. I think most people would have reacted similarly. It was wrong, but understandable.\n\n>I feel horrible because obviously I didn\u2019t mean to give the kid a rash\n\nDon't. It's a diaper rash. Toss a bit of cornstarch in there, and baby feels no pain, and the rash is gone in no time. No lasting harm done.\n\n...\n\nOverall, I don't think anyone was an AH, just that it could have been handled better. \n\n\"OMG little Nephew has a rash cause you put the wrong diaper on!!!\"\n\n\"Oh no, that's awful. He was out and I used one of mine... Does he have an allergy or something?\"\n\n\"YES AND YOU SHOULD HAVE TEXTED ME 1ST!11!\"\n\n\"I didn't think to do that. If it comes up again I sure will. Do you need some rash ointment, or have you got some already?\"\n\n... argument averted? idk. Conversations are always easier in hindsight, with time to plan them out, lol.\n\nYour nephew is fine. Your SIL will get over it. No lasting harm done!", "Yeah, I'm confused by this... I don't think my diaper bag ever had fewer than six diapers and two changes of clothes in it - I was basically told 'plan to be out a full day every time you leave the house' and packed accordingly. Yes, I had the money to not ration diapers, but come on - if you know your kid needs something special, you plan for that ...", "Right? What was OP supposed to do, leave the kid in a dirty diaper?", "This, plus a rash would have also happened if OP had left his nephew in a dirty nappy and she'd be upset about that as well.\n\nAlso SIL *never even told OP or his wife* about her son's need for special nappies due to allergies/sensitivity. How were they supposed to know if they aren't told? They aren't mind readers ffs.", "At my preschool if a baby runs out of diapers we try to use the same brand on them. It's usually a different aesthetic design or size but i havent seen any rashes forming due to the change. Altho, off topic, one of our babies has formed rashes with diapers since being a newborn to the point of developing  a huge cyst/pimple that had to be lanced by a doctor", "Not all diapers have the brand name printed on them either. If it's a brand OP is unfamiliar with he likely wouldn't have known which it was anyway", "Well, I guess it's better than using your nephew's diaper for your kid's next arts and crafts project.", "This was my exact thought reading this. Even worse, I\u2019m guessing OP didn\u2019t even notice until said shitty diaper was already off and nephew was cleaned and he\u2019s getting ready to put on a new diaper, only to discover there isn\u2019t any new ones. I guess SIL believes he should have either:\n\n1) left baby commando while OP takes both babies to the store? Or,\n\n2) put shitty diaper back on nephew so he could take him to the store?\n\nBoth options are pure insanity and #2 definitely going to lead to a much worse rash while #1 means basically a 100% chance of an accident somewhere.", "Yeah - I've been around the block with diaper rash and reactions to specific brands of diapers (and diaper creams - I still have Desitin flashbacks). Can confirm that a baby sitting in a dirty diaper is going to result in a *way* worse rash than the wrong brand of diaper. The onus is totally on the parents to notify caregivers about any allergies (and provide enough diapers!).", "And if he was allergic to a specific brand, she should've mentioned this. Next time she asks them to babysit, OP and his wife should just say, \"Obviously you can't trust us since the diaper incident where you failed to pack enough diapers. You'll have to find someone else.\" NTA", "She should have packed enough for the planned time of baby sitting, and then some extras. Little monsters think it\u2019s funny to pee before you even get the new diaper on them.", "Some kids have massive issues with one type of diaper vs another, so it very much is a thing, but the worse situation would be sitting in a dirty diaper of the preferred kind. OP had no choice but to change the kid. The kid's mom wants to blame someone other than herself for not packing enough.", "My son reacted poorly to pampers and would get really bad rashes from them. It\u2019s a thing for some babies. I could only put my son in Huggies. OP is still NTA. It\u2019s like any other allergy or sensitivity. You need a sitter, you provide for the child\u2019s needs and you tell the sitter about those needs. Expecting that someone would know to use specific brand without being told is stupid and entitled.", "I don't have kids but when I babysit for friends' children they come over with bags and bags of stuff for nearly every contingency.  Sometimes I question if these parents are coming back for their children! (kidding)\n\nI understand that they are probably privileged to be have that much stuff on hand but I suspect that if they didn't and I had to improvise, I wouldn't get a lecture about how I diapered their child in a pinch.", "Like, if the wrong diaper leaves a rash, what did mom think sitting in a diaper full of pee and poop was gonna do?", "I feel like it's less the actual switching and more the different diaper itself. Either the material irritates them, its sized differently so it runs the skin more, etc. I can tell you pampers give my son a mild rash but every other brand I've tried has been fine. \n\nThat poor baby! I've heard cloth diapers can be great for babies whose bottoms dont agree with disposables", "It\u2019s very unlikely OP had the car seats necessary so going to the store was completely not an option anyway. OP did the best they could and it\u2019s the mom\u2019s fault for not being prepared for what her child would need.", "haha so true", "Uh, no, you wouldn't. It would never OCCUR to me to berate someone who helped me out in a pinch - because the fact that they needed to would mean that a) something has gone horribly wrong, and I was grateful, or b) I'd somehow mucked up by not providing what was necessary and they pulled my butt out of the fire and I was grateful or c) something totally unexpected happened and they coped with it for me and I was grateful.\n\nSee the theme there?", "Yeah I thought about that as well"]}
