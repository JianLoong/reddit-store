She\u2019s had a long-term battle with BPD.\n\nWhen I was 19 at my first big girl job, I was so proud and happy of the things I was doing that I would constantly share it with my family. One day - my mom told me that I should be more considerate of what I share as it made my sister feel inferior to me. I stopped talking about work with them, but I would still share good news with my mom. Each time, she would respond: \u201cYou\u2019re doing so well. Why don\u2019t you give your sister some of these opportunities instead?\u201d.\n\nI went completely freelance and she would still say: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a proper 9-5 like your sister and save money?\u201d even though now I earn twice the amount I used to at a 9-5.\n\nSince then, I stopped talking about anything with them. Recently my sister got into drawing and gotten really good at it. I gave her my iPad and told her she could have it to continue learning.\n\nFast forward to today: my mom comes to me and shows me a drawing my sister did and goes: \u201cLook at how good this is. You should tell her how talented she is.\u201d and I lost it. Maybe it\u2019s the years of emotion I\u2019ve been suppressing but I told her that I\u2019m tired of constantly being made to feel like I need to disregard my feelings to make space for everybody else. She asked me why I was being that way as I was being angry for no good reason.

Just because you may of been luckier then your little sister should not mean that you have to stop, or not talk about it.", "NTA. This would be unbelievably frustrating. I suspect your mom is too blind to ever see it and the best course will just be to keep going lower and lower contact. Don't let yourself become trapped into becoming their dumping ground AND caregiver.", "NTA. Why is your sister, who\u2019s older than you, being babied by your mom? It\u2019s not your job to give your sister an ego or morale boost, and it sounds incredibly annoying/exhausting to be constantly nagged to do this.\n\nI\u2019m also Asian and we\u2019ve too often suppressed our emotions to sweep issues under the rug to avoid further issues with elders/parents. I think your reaction, while not the most ideal response, was completely understandable and I probably would also have lost it if I was in your shoes. We blow up when we\u2019re finally fed up after getting our buttons constantly pushed and they can\u2019t understand why we\u2019re so emotional. \n\nTake some time to calm down and relax and hopefully you can go back with a clearer head.", "NTA. I went through many of the exact same things with my family and my BPD sister. It's tough on family and particularly the siblings. Not fair to you. It seems you have been trying to be supportive and understanding, but they have no real concept of how much it affects you. I recommend trying to explain how her telling you these things makes you feel and if that doesn't work, asking your mother if she'd be willing to go to a therapist together. It does help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
