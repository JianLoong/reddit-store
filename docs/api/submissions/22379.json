I think the question is do you want a relationship with your dad going forward? His SIL just died, and his daughter is on life support.

That can be a true statement, but you have to be willing to accept the impact of that statement on your relationship with your father.", "YTA. Your father was asking for your support. He has already lost a son (in-law) and may be about to lose a daughter. Her life is likely going to change dramatically so in some ways he has already lost the daughter he had. He is grieving and wants the support of those that he loves and that he hopes loves him too. When my brother-in-law was about to pass last year from cancer, several siblings flew across the country to be there either before he died or for the funeral.

That's an injury that a lot of people don't survive. Your dad has most likely been told to prepare for the worst and call all immediate family and get them there so they can say goodbye. Have you asked your dad what her chances are or do just not care at all because she got the man you really liked because he was in love with her? Either way I think your an AH because life support is no JOKE!", "INFO:\n\nIs your sister dying or in danger of it?", "NTA for not going, but YTA for the comments about karma. \n\nI am thinking a lot of the commenters do not have kids. It's probably less about the injured sister and more about the parents needing support. If one of my kids was severely hurt like that, I would probably be in extreme need of a hug from my other kids. \n\nI don't think you should drop everything and go to them now, especially after the comments. The parents are  extremely stressed. I don't know your financial situation but there have been times in my life when I have majosrly saved for vacation and if I had been counting on my one time of relaxation and then couldn't go AND lost all my money, I would be extremely angry and resentful, not necessarily at my family but just in general. For both sides, there is the potential for a blow-up that could completely destroy what's left of your relationship. I would apologize by phone and offer to call or message your dad daily and offer to arrange a visit in the near future.", "YTA. YTA. \n\nYour sister is on life support with a brain injury. This might be your last chance to say goodbye and if your sister survives, she might never be the same. Her husband is dead. She has a brain injury that most likely will impair her in some way- speech, hearing, ability to control mood, seizures- and that is only IF she survives which doesn't sound very likely. \n\nAnd the reason you're not going is because you thought yourself entitled to another person. You said so yourself in your comments. You fell out with your sister because you felt entitled to a boy you had a crush on despite the fact he had no interest in you, only your sister. Being upset? Understandable. Needing distance until you got over it or a more distant relationship in general? Alright but you have turned that understandable upset into complete apathy towards your sister's life. \n\nIf you were really over it, you would show a shred of concern for your sister but you aren't. You don't seem to realize that your actions affect your relationships, and I wouldn't surprised if your father, stepmom, remaining half-siblings and even your best friend couldn't look at you the same way.", "So let me get this straight, Anna's husband died at the scene, Anna herself is on life support with a brain injury. According to your comments you were in love with Anna's husband but he didn't like you back. He was  in love with Anna and your mom even talked to Anna to not date him because of you?. You told your father it was his karma that Anna had a terrible accident because of his affair?. \n\nOP do you hold a huge resentment to Anna because of her husband? Are all these facts wrong?.... I'll make my judgement after.", "The BIL died and you had romantic feelings for him and you said this was \u201ckarma\u201d for your father stepping out.\n\nProbably should have put that in the post.\n\nYTA.

That would be a waste of time.  NTA.", "YTA. There's a big difference between them being scratched up in a fender bender and the situation you described in the comments. While the timing is unfortunate this is a major, life altering situation and has nothing to do with any of the family dynamics you vomited about in your post.

Your father asked because he want you as support, a brain injury as you started she has is not minor, and of course you're allowed to say no.  \n\nHowever at your age you've got realize that these types of decisions, and in my opinion this one is very callous to choose a vacation over family member with a brain injury, will have big consequences within your family and as long as you're okay with that then you're good with yourself.", "Info: it seems there\u2019s time to both see Anna/the family while making your vacation in a few days, is that right?

You even got your mum to try and persuade her to not show any interest in him, presumably so you could try harder to catch his attention.  \n\nIf you genuinely feel that a holiday is worth more than being with your Dad and siblings as they try to deal with this as well as process their grief for Anna's husband and maybe even make funeral arrangements for him, then they're probably better of without you.", "If you saw her as your sister you would drop everything to go but you don\u2019t seem to have that kind of bond.
