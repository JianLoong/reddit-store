Doesn't matter if you have smth else planned or not", "NTA if the two of you are not in a relationship them Just Go to your vacation If Thats already paid her has already family there so Just what you want to do", "It feels like there trying to guilt you into visiting stick to your plans it sounds like she has enough family already there", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a warm relationship and have never been close. \n\nShe\u2019s obviously a person you wouldn\u2019t chose on your own to befriend and wouldn\u2019t see/talk to her at all if it wasn\u2019t for your shared father. \n\nSounds like you are Much closer to your average coworker than her, so of course you don\u2019t want to nor see the point in changing your plans for her sake. \n\nPlus let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s not her but your father and his wife who\u2019s asked for you. Now weather that\u2019s because they want you to act the babysitter to the younger children(if there are any) or so they can pretend that you are all a \u2018big happy family and nobody Ever cheated on anyone we all looooove each other\u2019 that I can\u2019t say.", "NAH - neither party is being unreasonable; but you don\u2019t have any real relationship to your sister.", "NAH\n\nYou don't have a close relationship with Anna.  And you have existing plans that can't be changed.  Additionally, your personal presence wouldn't change or improve anything about Anna's situation.  For instance, you're not a worl famous surgeon or anything, right?\n\nYour father isn't wrong for wanting your support, but you can send your thoughts and prayers from wherever you are.  It isn't necessary for you to be there in person.", "I lean toward saying NAH, your father wanting you there isn't unreasonable, but given the fact that you and Anna aren't close and you have already spent the money for your vacation, I can see why you aren't willing to reschedule your plans. Soft Y T A for telling him the situation is his doing, you and Anna are adults, your relationship or lack thereof is your own doing, not his.", "NTA.", "Theyre obviously upset but it doesn't sound like you have any relationship with Anna so I can understand not wanting to change your plans.

Are we talking like some broken bones (something she\u2019ll recover from) or are we talking hospitalized and touch-and-go, might die?", "NAH. You can\u2019t make someone have a relationship or feelings for someone else. Heck there are full blood siblings who just don\u2019t get along. I hope she is okay, but even if she was about to pass, you are under no obligation to see her.", "Unless Anna is at deaths door and its a chance to say goodbye - then NTA. \n\nIf shes dying then YTA. \n\nBut its more likely you are being helicoptered in to help out with things during her recovery, or your dad really is oblivious to the type of relationship you have with her", "Not that it any less horrible but is Anna going to be ok or is she really messed up? Is this something that she could pass from? If so I\u2019d stay if she\u2019s going to be ok I\u2019d go. You left that out! So you could be TA or NOT.", "I think it really depends on how severe her injuries are. If this is a life changing accident, or she\u2019s been touch and go, then maybe yeah you\u2019re the AH for not seeing if you can go for just one day. Alternatively, if she broke a few bones, I think you\u2019re fine. Either way maybe if you can\u2019t go, send flower or a card or something to the hospital.", "I mean ANNA wasn't the one that had the affair n it feels like ur punishing her because daddy was a dog don't be mean go see ur sister n make sure she's okie", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
