She and our dad divorced 10 years ago and dad was our sole parent. We saw mom a handful of times in the last decade but that was not her being a parent, it was either for show or it was a thing of all of us being in the same place. Four years ago she got married to James and became a stepmom to James' daughter who is about 12 now.\n\nMy siblings and I were invited to the wedding but we didn't go. Mom showed up on our dad's doorstep with them a month before the wedding so we could all meet and it was awkward and we weren't interested. \n\nJames' daughter was very excited and thought she was getting siblings. She tried to invite my sister to share a room at mom's house and wanted us to have sleepovers. James was beaming at her while mom said nothing. Dad had to step in and tell mom she, James and his daughter needed to leave because \"that poor little girl is going to have her heart broken if she expects a happy family with us and mom\" and he didn't want us to be forced to deal with a younger child being set up for heartbreak. He knew we were never going to spend any time with her since he knew we wouldn't be spending time with our mom either.\n\nJames' daughter used to seek my younger brother out at school before he started high school this year. She really did believe we would be her siblings and that we'd all be one family. Dad tried to get mom to put a stop to it but she didn't want to do anything and James said he didn't see the reason why we'd deny her siblings when she's innocent.\n\nYesterday I was getting some groceries for home when James' daughter approached me and asked why she wasn't invited to my birthday party the weekend before. She started to cry and said she heard about it from grandma and grandpa (mom's parents) and they were invited and my cousins were invited and she wasn't. She said she would have wanted to come and was bringing up the whole sibling thing again. James was behind her and I told him that he needed to explain things to his daughter instead of letting her approach me and my siblings in public.\n\nHe was like she has a right to ask the important questions and asked why it was such a big deal. We were being little jerks after all. It pissed me off and I started to yell at him about how he knew the kind of woman he was marrying and yet they sold his kid on the idea that she was getting siblings. I told him if that was his goal for his kid then he needed to marry someone who wasn't a shitty mom and he needed to help her with the fact we would never be family, let alone siblings. James called me a little turd for saying all that in front of his daughter and in public.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694434917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ftvjb/aita_for_yelling_at_my_moms_husband_in_front_of/", "score": 384, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I fell sorry for his daughter because it is clear that false expectations have been raised in her and all of this will lead her to suffer when she realizes the reality of the facts (assuming that it has not already happened).\n\nBut it is also true that none of this is your fault or your sibling's (it's your mother behaviour over the years that has created all this mess) and you are absolutely right when you say that your mother and her father should and could have spared her all this considering the whole situation regarding the non-existent relationship with your mother\n\nEDIT: grammar", "NTA\n\nYour mother and her new husband set that kid up for heartbreak. This is on them.", "NTA. They\u2019re your bio-mom\u2019s family. You don\u2019t have an obligation to her new family.

Sounds like you, your siblings and your dad have tried to calmly explain things, either to her or with her in the room, and he's trying to force something that's not going to happen.", "Nta at all. Mom has not been a mom and why force you all to play happy family. You tried to get James engaged and he keeps ignoring the fact your mom is the reason happy family is imposible. James's should be asking if he's an ah for calling you a name", "NTA\n\nJames and your mom were warned that this would happen. They hurt that poor girl by refusing to listen to you.", "NTA. The adults are failing her. If she tries again take a moment to explain things to her. Don't be mean about it, but do be honest about what the relationship with your mom is really like and tell her that they lied to her. To you she's a stranger, not a sibling, and her constantly popping up and demanding a relationship is like being stalked. You don't have anything against her but you do have issues with your mom so won't ever be in their lives.", "sounds like he and your mom deserve each other, tbh.

You know his daughter wanted a fun blended family, but that\u2019s not what is available with your mom. She hasn\u2019t been an involved parent with you. You\u2019re not being malicious about James and his daughter, but you aren\u2019t going to invest time and attention to her.

It\u2019s really messed up that these adults are forcing all of this on you. They need to act like adults and have real conversations and stop lying. The way that they are manipulating his daughter plus you and your siblings is sickening. I am so sorry you have to deal with all of this stress and trauma. I hope all of this ends soon. Maybe you can talk to your grandparents? Hopefully they can reason with your mother.", "Nta he allowed his daughter to approach you and question you in public.
