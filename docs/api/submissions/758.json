They came out to me as Nonbinary when they were 17, they are now 19. In June of 2021 their boyfriend (M20) moved in with us in my mother's home. (My mother has dementia and lives in a nursing home.) My teen has multiple health issues, both physical and mental. This is important later on.\nWhen they turned 18, I started charging my teen rent ($500/month which is cheap in our area.) I charged their boyfriend the same amount. The boyfriend has always been a very handy person and has fixed a lot of things in my home. The house is the same age as me and my mother never has had it renovated. He has done the work around the house after his actual job as a manager at a local restaurant chain. He has asked that he's either compensated for his work or that he gets money off his rent for the month. I've told him no everytime as I've never asked him to do the work. I think it's ridiculous that I should have to pay for something I've never asked him to do. (ie rehanging doors that don't close, redoing the kitchen floors since they're old, mowing both the front and backyard.) \nIn late April of this year my teen got Covid-19. Because of their health issues they were hospitalized for over a month and lost their job because of it. I still expected them to pay rent, which they refused since they \"Had no job and weren't even home.\" The boyfriend called me heartless and that he wouldn't be paying their rent either. I decided to keep my mouth shut and ask at a later date. \nWhen my teen returned, they stayed downstairs because the doctor said they should avoid stairs as much as possible. The boyfriend brought down an AC that they had bought from me and set it up in the room for them. He bought an air mattress for them. I asked if he could afford an air mattress why couldn't he afford to give me their rent? He ignored me.\nA week passed and the boyfriend knocked on my door and demanded I \"let him borrow\" the fan I had in the basement. I told him no. Then I got a phone call from my teen asking why I wouldn't let him \"borrow\" the fan until they were able to bring the AC back to the bedroom they shared. I left my house, and went to the library. I was tired of being disrespected in my own home and returned with two eviction papers.\nFrom what I've heard my teen ended up in a homeless shelter in a city 2 hours away and their boyfriend is somewhere on the west coast. After their 30 days were up at the shelter my Teen texted and asked me to take them in. I told them no as I can't trust that they'll be respectful towards me. My ex husband decided to play hero and drove 6-7 hours just to pick them up. He's calling me an asshole and saying that I \"need to think less like a landlord and more like a mother.\" I don't think I'm in the wrong here.

And why on earth should he do all those repairs on a house he has no equity in for free, don't be absurd.\n\nAll of that makes it clear you're an asshole. But then your child, who has medical issues, gets COVID and ends up in the hospital. And your main concern is that while they're in the hospital, and has no job, they can't pay rent for the house they're not even in.\n\nSo then they have to stay in a shelter because you kicked them out.

They came out to me as Nonbinary when they were 17, they are now 19. In June of 2021 their boyfriend (M20) moved in with us in my mother's home. (My mother has dementia and lives in a nursing home.) My teen has multiple health issues, both physical and mental. This is important later on.\nWhen they turned 18, I started charging my teen rent ($500/month which is cheap in our area.) I charged their boyfriend the same amount. The boyfriend has always been a very handy person and has fixed a lot of things in my home. The house is the same age as me and my mother never has had it renovated. He has done the work around the house after his actual job as a manager at a local restaurant chain. He has asked that he's either compensated for his work or that he gets money off his rent for the month. I've told him no everytime as I've never asked him to do the work. I think it's ridiculous that I should have to pay for something I've never asked him to do. (ie rehanging doors that don't close, redoing the kitchen floors since they're old, mowing both the front and backyard.) \nIn late April of this year my teen got Covid-19. Because of their health issues they were hospitalized for over a month and lost their job because of it. I still expected them to pay rent, which they refused since they \"Had no job and weren't even home.\" The boyfriend called me heartless and that he wouldn't be paying their rent either. I decided to keep my mouth shut and ask at a later date. \nWhen my teen returned, they stayed downstairs because the doctor said they should avoid stairs as much as possible. The boyfriend brought down an AC that they had bought from me and set it up in the room for them. He bought an air mattress for them. I asked if he could afford an air mattress why couldn't he afford to give me their rent? He ignored me.\nA week passed and the boyfriend knocked on my door and demanded I \"let him borrow\" the fan I had in the basement. I told him no. Then I got a phone call from my teen asking why I wouldn't let him \"borrow\" the fan until they were able to bring the AC back to the bedroom they shared. I left my house, and went to the library. I was tired of being disrespected in my own home and returned with two eviction papers.\nFrom what I've heard my teen ended up in a homeless shelter in a city 2 hours away and their boyfriend is somewhere on the west coast. After their 30 days were up at the shelter my Teen texted and asked me to take them in. I told them no as I can't trust that they'll be respectful towards me. My ex husband decided to play hero and drove 6-7 hours just to pick them up. He's calling me an asshole and saying that I \"need to think less like a landlord and more like a mother.\" I don't think I'm in the wrong here.
