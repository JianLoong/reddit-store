My mom is terrible, and I'm well into my 40s. Good job.", "NTA She doesn't want you to struggle like she did. Her thinking is affected by her experience of taking \"job after job.\" Maybe she thinks you're too smart for a regular job. Charter schools might suck, but parents send their kids to charter schools thinking they are superior to public education, which might mean she thinks you're smart and deserved \"better\" than public school education. However, with all that said, it sounds like she really screwed up and wasn't parenting in the best way. Like you said, she was too controlling. She can't be happy with your happiness.", "NTA. Honestly sounds like she\u2019s jealous of you for being content with your life while she isn\u2018t. It could be also concern but in this case it seems unlikely.  It could also be that she has been forcing you to be what she wants to be and live through you in a way. \n\nagain ur not the a-hole and as ive seen you comment maybe try going back to therapy and see if it helps you", "If you want a better relationship then maybe the both of you should consider family therapy. Screaming matches are not healthy & it appears neither of you are willing to listen to each other. You\u2019re probably going to need some help to understand each other. Seems to be a lot of resentment & bitterness here. I hope at the very least you try to get some help so you can move forward & feel better about yourself. \n\nWish you well! \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly it sounds like your mother sees you as an extension of herself, not as an individual. She wants more, so she thinks *you* should want more. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s another side, but honestly even if there is, knowing that won\u2019t help your relationship with your mother, not really. Because if there is some underlaying trauma or something, the fact she refuses to go to therapy means she won\u2019t deal with it. Which means she won\u2019t try to be a better person and mother", "Info:\n\nYou simultaneously say that your mother was barely present in your life and that your grandparents mostly raised you . . . and that your mother was an overly restrictive parent who \"forced you to do things you hated\", kept you from friends, etc. \n\nIt can't be both, so which is it?\n\nThis reads like either you're a troll, or (more likely), you're so intent on hating your mother that no matter what she did you were going to read it as the Worst Thing Ever . . . either she wasn't parent enough or she was too much parent. And I get it, you're 19, and angry, and you feel like you know everything and you have all the answers. I was you at 19 as well and furious with my parents all the time. And to be fair, they weren't always great parents. But also, I was kind of monstrous to them and I didn't understand it at the time. I had no long-term perspective at all, like most 19-year-olds. And it took me years to understand that.\n\nI suspect that this is a N-A-H or E-S-H situation. Your mum has clearly made mistakes, but also, it sounds like she's trying to point out to you that what feels like a great life plan at 19 may feel very much less so in 10 or 15 years, and your prefrontal cortex isn't developed enough to have that kind of perspective yet. She's not trying to be an AH, she's trying to get you to understand that you may not have as many answers to life as you think you do.", "ETA. You are 19 and think you know everything, and your mother isn't the greatest mom. In her own flawed way, your mother is trying to give you advice and point you towards a better life. You both need to be more respectful of each other, but telling your mother to \"Go to hell. You never could even BEGIN to be the mother you think you are, being 'supportive' and 'understanding'\" is just wrong on so many levels. It just goes to show you that you are not as mature as you think you are.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(And the parents who went to university generally expect their kids will too.)\n\nThe parent who had poor paying jobs wants their kid to be ambitious and climb the ladder.\n\nAnd often, the parent who got the degree, climbed the ladder and did well financially wants their kid to go into something they love.\n\nWe often express these wishes poorly.\n\nAnd some parents live vicariously through their kids and want them to do what they wish they had done.   This could be your mom. It is a very bad thing.  Some parents have trouble understanding their kid's life is their own life and no a \"do over\" for the parents.\n\nYou are doing well for 19 and if you are happy, that's what counts.  \n\nIt's never too early to think about the future and education is rarely wasted.  So think about your life and what you want out of it."]}
