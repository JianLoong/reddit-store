He said he would pay, you said you would split, he declined the offer and paid. This isn't Japan where you have to decline like 8 times for it to be considered polite. \n\nI generally follow this rule of thumb myself: offer and if they decline then that's that. \n\nI'm also going to say, you are pretty young. What he is doing is extremely immature. If he expected you to fight him on this, he's an idiot. My advice is to not go on another date. *He* is actually displaying the red flag behavior, not you. \n\nNTA", "NTA.
