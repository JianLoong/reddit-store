I am also incredibly hungover.\n\nAnyways, both him and his sister moved from the US to escape from his mother and now he is low contact with her, and that's only so that he can see his dad. I genuinely don't know how a man as sweet and caring as John could be related to an absolute harpy like his mother or what his father sees in her. From the moment I met her she has hated me and made sure I knew that she hates me, between snide remarks and picking apart my appearance I have tried to bear with it for John's sake. He's told me multiple times that I don't need to interact with her and that he understands if I'm not up to his monthly zoom calls with his parents. \n\nThis year we spent Christmas in the US with his family. John told me that while he wouldn't force me to go, he really wanted me their for emotional support since this would be his first Christmas with her in 7 years. His family also wanted to finally meet me in person and in the end I agreed. On Christmas eve we went to his uncle's house and had a lovely time since his mom was on her best behavior and kept her general unpleasantness to a minimum. Then came Christmas day and after dinner we had some drinks. It did not take long for his mother to get both drunk and verbally belligerent. In her tirade she mainly focused on me, how I'm a slut who shouldn't be anywhere near her son, but towards the end she stopped for a second, stared at John, and then said that he was a disappointment, a failure and some other choice words I'd rather not repeat. At that point he just got up and left the room. Before I went to check on him I snapped at her and told her that she's the failure, all of her kids moved across an ocean to get away from her, and the only reason that we're even here is because he loves his father more than he hates her. I didn't stay there to see her reaction but after calming John down we heard his mother screaming and crying downstairs. After jumping out the window we got a hotel and stayed there until our flight back home. \n\nNow his entire family is sending us angry messages since his mom has been a wreck after. John backs me completely and says all I did was tell her the truth, and while he's upset that this has caused a \"total earfuck of a shitstorm\" with his family, he isn't upset with me and knows that it sucked having to deal with her. But when I asked a few friends they said I shouldn't have been so harsh since I knew she would retaliate.", "created_utc": 1672592118, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100nozi/aita_for_snapping_at_my_mil/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good for you!!!  Standing up to in-laws needs to be done. Her knowing your not going to take her crap and put her in her place says loudly that you are not going to bow down and will stand up to protect yourself and boyfriend.  Well done.  As for the rest of the family. They\u2019ll get over it,  just keep reminding them what she said to cause this and they will get it eventually", "Tough one for you, OP. Way to stick up for your SO, but I can identify with having a toxic parent, and the (sometimes) need to hold your tongue just to prevent things going from bad to worse.  Short story though - NTA.", "NTA. The fact you two had to leave THROUGH THE WINDOW says a lot about the situation. I think it would be best to find ways for your husband to see his dad. If people come after you, ask them why they didn't say anything when she started attacking you.\n\nMaybe she deserved to be wrecked if she can't act nice.", "NTA at all. Someone needed to confront her!", "Info where is the dad in all this ?", "NTA\n\nNobody should have to deal with being verbally assaulted. She finally ran into someone who wouldn't take it.", "NTA. I note, and hopefully your bf did as well, that you let her calling you a slut go, but snapped when she called your bf a \"disappointment\", among other things. I think it would be really disturbing to have someone trash the person you love and no one say anything in their defense. A part of me thinks that maybe you should have stopped short of being so harsh, but if days after the initial argument with you, where she said worse things about her own son than you did about her, people are angry at you because she is so *loudly* upset with you, not herself, about it, then aren't they calling because they are being manipulated by her to do so? She is presenting an ultimatum, I will carry on and make all of my family miserable, hating my son and his girlfriend for treating his mother like this, until they apologize, groveling and begging my forgiveness. What they really want is for her to be quiet, and for you two to do whatever it takes to make her stop.", "Oh lol vyy", "YTA - I\u2019m with your friends on this.", "NTA!

MIL needed to hear it. \n\nMy mom was similar - all her kids (me, my brother and 2 sisters) disowned her at some point or another and she always figured it was because of someone or something else.
