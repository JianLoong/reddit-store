At that point he just got up and left the room.

Or, like many in abusive/toxic relationships blinded themselves to the reality & keep expecting the mother to become again what he fell in love with. He no longer is proactive shielding children.\n\nMother may have a drinking problem (alcoholic) also with combination of other mental health issues undiagnosed. Many alcoholics medicate their mental issues. Makes sense for the negative toxicity she gives out and son's PTSD about her.\n\n***Only person that can attempt to do anything (recover) is the mother. No screaming, shouting or low contact will change someone a mentally ill person and/or an addict. Possibly medication & counseling can affect their moods. Harsh fact: It took so many years to get into this condition, it will not be sudden to change it overnight. Most likely will take years to stabilize if willing & there can be setbacks.***\n\nIt means despite OP telling the mother the truth, it does nothing. It makes OP feel good in the short-term, but mother's been a master manipulator for at least 40 years. She uses crocodile tears, histrionics, omitting facts & distorting them to get her family on her side so it does nothing.

Then again, if only she talks to these people, her being a master manipulator & liar have them think the worst of her children & OP.\n\nGo to NC with her completely. Talk only to the father when he's in the car somewhere out or over at a friend/relative. Don't get into the habit of calling the father at home nor answering the mother on the phone.

Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.  \nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.  \nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.  \nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?  \nBallast!  \nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.  \nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .  \nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.  \nNow you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.  \nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!  \nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.  \nYou know what would be easier? If they all just chucked the bitch overboard.  \n   \nThank you for letting me ramble. Thanks for the support, and advice, and humour. Thanks for just being here :)\n\nSend them this in an email and tell them to stop being her flying monkeys, and then block them.", "Haven\u2019t seen the boat rocking analogy posted yet, but this is basically why\u2026https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/77w8lf/dont_rock_the_boat/", "Same here. I got in an argument with my close friend's fianc\u00e9e/roommate about her treating said close friend/her fianc\u00e9 like shit and she went off talking shit about me and I didn't react how she wanted so she started talking shit about my husband, who wasn't there. I warned her to stop where she was heading before she said something she'd regret. She didn't stop and she regretted it when I punched her in the face and slammed her head into the wall. I am not usually a violent person, but she went too far and I lost it. Don't bring my loved ones into your bullshit.", "Years ago my ex-bf and I were having dinner at some friends home. My bf was saying not very pleasant things about my 10 yo daughter, who was not there. I didn't want to cause a scene, but I quietly to bf to shut up several times. Our male friend, sitting across me, looked at me looked at bf and said \"Beware the mama tiger when she's angry\". Only then did bf stop talking. Nobody, but NOBODY says anything about MY child without cause. My daughter was not a spoiled brat, he just didn't agree with one small thing, like practicing ASL. Yep, that was it.\nOP is NTA, she was telling the truth and protecting her own.", "As they say, \u201cdon\u2019t start none, won\u2019t be none\u201d."]}
