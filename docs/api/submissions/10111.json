Because of this and the fact that my husband and I both have good careers, my SIL has always had a snobby attitude towards us and my side of the family, and tries to mooch off of us at any chance she gets.\n\nWhen we go out to eat with my husbands side of the family we're expected to pay. Christmas and birthday his side of the family expects \"good gifts\" etc.\n\nHis sister is currently on her third marriage, and has three children all under the age of 10.\n\nHer and her husband were looking for a place to host their wedding and approached me about using one of my dads properties to host it.\n\nI was very hesitant at first to help her because of the treatment she has given me in the past, but it's my dads property after all so I contacted him to ask him about it.\n\nHe said it's my call, but told me to 1) have them sign some type of agreement stating that if any damage is done to the house, they are liable. 2) they are going to be charged a reasonable fee to use the house. We both agreed on $1500, which I believe is VERY reasonable considering this is a massive house.\n\nI told SIL and her husband about this. They asked about a \"family discount\", I told them this was a family discount and take it or leave it.\n\nThey signed the agreement and payed.\n\nFast forward 2 day's after the wedding I went over to the house. House is a complete mess. Bed sheets are stained, a vase destroyed, alcohol bottles floating in the pool etc. I contact my dad to tell him, he tells me to access the damage and see how much it is. It was around $1000 worth of damage. My dad contacts my SIL himself and explains to her the damage and what she owes him.\n\nShe loses her shit and starts going off about how this is bullshit, we're family she shouldn't even be charged in the first place, we're so well off we can happily afford to pay for the damages, if she gives him that money they won't be able to afford to go on a honey moon etc etc.\n\nShe then calls me up to harrass me and start's calling me a \"b\\*tch who thinks she's too good for everyone\" and says \"it's a wedding what do you expect? Sorry my people know how to have a good time\".\n\nMy dad gives her 30 days to pay (she was notified about this), 30 days comes and no payment. So my dad get his lawyer to contact SIL explaining how she's being taken to court for not paying.\n\nHer and my MIL have been contacting my husband non stop trying to get him to give her the money. He refuses because he agrees that what she did was irresponsible and wrong.\n\nI had to block MIL and SIL after they sent me nasty messages and even tried to show up at my house to \"talk to me\".\n\nI feel bad that my husbands relationship with his mom and sister is going to be ruined over $1000. But I feel like what she did was wrong and she wasn't even sorry about it.\n\nEDIT: I should also add that my SIL and her husband were given a key to the house to use it and lock it up when they were leaving it. The key was returned to me at my house, the next day I went over to the house which is when I found the damage. \n\nSo they left the house in the condition for me to see with no care in the world.", "created_utc": 1676559428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113si0k/aita_for_taking_legal_action_against_my_sil_for/", "score": 915, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Trust me, he knows exactly who she is and always has, which is why he is not upset with you and hasn't been from the beginning. He loves you, he understands what's happening here, and he supports you because he knows that you aren't the morally questionable AH here. To wit:\n\n>She loses her shit and starts going off about how . . . we're so well off we can happily afford to pay for the damages\n\nYup, you are. But what she doesn't seem to understand - as most AHs don't - is that first of all, what you can afford and what is your responsibility are two very different things. I'm sure your family can afford lots of things. That doesn't, in ANY universe, make it your responsibility to pay for nonsense that OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT YOU cause.\n\nMore importantly, the REASON that your family has this kind of money is that your father is a smart businessman who DOESN'T go around just burning his money, paying for things that aren't his to pay for. He didn't cause this damage, your SIL did. The fact that he can afford to pay to fix it is irrelevant. Bill Gates can afford to pay for it too, but she's not asking him for the money, because he's not the one who caused it. Neither is your dad. She and her guests broke it, she pays to fix it.  **Your SIL is getting a very late, very overdue welcome into the world of being a responsible adult.**\n\n>if she gives him that money they won't be able to afford to go on a honey moon etc etc.\n\nThen I guess she probably should have thought of that before she allowed her guests to destroy someone else's property during her wedding without trying to stop them, after signing a contract that included being responsible for damages.\n\n>\r  \nShe then calls me up to harrass me and start's calling me a \"b\\*tch who thinks she's too good for everyone\" \n\nNot everyone, just her. You are, in fact, better than her. Not because of your money, to be clear, but just as a moral, ethical, responsible human being. I always find it hilarious when awful people are like, \"You think you're better than me.\" Yup. Not just think, know. Decent, respectful humans ARE better than her. \n\n>and says \"it's a wedding what do you expect? Sorry my people know how to have a good time\".\n\nI have been to many wonderful, super fun weddings. Not a single one of them resulted in property damage. \"Her people\" weren't \"\\[having\\] a good time, they were behaving like animals. But yeah, I'm sure she's sorry now.\n\nYou are NTA, my friend. Maybe this will be a wakeup call to her, but I doubt it.", "NTA - Husband is better off without those toxic people. If husbands mom is so concerned, she can pay the damages and cleaning fees, otherwise she should shut up.", "NTA, she signed the agreement and fucked up. I feel bad for your husband, he must be extremely embarrassed by his family\u2019s actions. Would love an update too !", "NTA there is a reason you two are family...SIL  is sister IN LAW.

Although, you should probably have not even offered it to begin with if your relationship with the SIL was already the way that you were describing it.  I like how it seems like your dad is suing based on principle and not due to the actual amount owed, cause lawyer fees can quite easily and quickly surpass the $1000 he's trying to sue them for.  \n\nAt the end of the day, if you're just out $1000 in damages, I would leave it at that and use it as a good reason to never have to talk/deal with SIL ever again.", "NTA. She signed a contract. Depending on the damage, 1,000 sounds reasonable. She should be sued. It's not your or your husband's fault that the sis and mom are AHs.

Sure if your looking into the title it's misleading but she wants judgment since she handled everything up to the lawsuit.", "Sounds like OP tried give SIL the benefit of the doubt.

Random user, rather than worse.\n\nYou could lend a friend a truck every few weeks, as long as you got it back nicer than you lent it out, maybe with a full tank of gas.  But if they bring it back messed up or with the gas tank empty, that's the end of that, right?\n\nI can see why it would be about more than the $1,000, especially if the SIL has been kind of low-key abusing them the whole time.", "Not sure why you're getting downvoted so much, but consider this:\n\nThe property-owning dad seems very successful.

It\u2019s a nuisance, but does send a message.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019d worry about is trying to recover the full replacement cost of sheets, the vase, and whatever else she broke.  You can typically only recover the value of similar items, e.g., used sheets that are five years old and a second hand vase.  If you have the receipt for the vase, they might give you a depreciated value in cash, but if you can find a similar vase sold on eBay they could justify asking for that amount.  Presenting the courts with receipts for a cleaning crew or handyman services for repairs is pretty cut and dried.  \n\nIf they don\u2019t show, the courts may award the full amount in default.\n\nIf they don\u2019t pay, you can go take their stuff or garnish wages.  Also annoying, but sends a message.\n\nSo you\u2019re in the right, but decide how hard and how long you\u2019re willing to fight.
