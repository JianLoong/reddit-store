{"id": 10111, "submission_id": "113si0k", "title": "AITA for taking legal action against my SIL for damage she did to my dads property?", "selftext": "My (24F) dad is pretty well off and own multiple properties in both the country I live in, as well as back in his home country. Because of this and the fact that my husband and I both have good careers, my SIL has always had a snobby attitude towards us and my side of the family, and tries to mooch off of us at any chance she gets.\n\nWhen we go out to eat with my husbands side of the family we're expected to pay. Christmas and birthday his side of the family expects \"good gifts\" etc.\n\nHis sister is currently on her third marriage, and has three children all under the age of 10.\n\nHer and her husband were looking for a place to host their wedding and approached me about using one of my dads properties to host it.\n\nI was very hesitant at first to help her because of the treatment she has given me in the past, but it's my dads property after all so I contacted him to ask him about it.\n\nHe said it's my call, but told me to 1) have them sign some type of agreement stating that if any damage is done to the house, they are liable. 2) they are going to be charged a reasonable fee to use the house. We both agreed on $1500, which I believe is VERY reasonable considering this is a massive house.\n\nI told SIL and her husband about this. They asked about a \"family discount\", I told them this was a family discount and take it or leave it.\n\nThey signed the agreement and payed.\n\nFast forward 2 day's after the wedding I went over to the house. House is a complete mess. Bed sheets are stained, a vase destroyed, alcohol bottles floating in the pool etc. I contact my dad to tell him, he tells me to access the damage and see how much it is. It was around $1000 worth of damage. My dad contacts my SIL himself and explains to her the damage and what she owes him.\n\nShe loses her shit and starts going off about how this is bullshit, we're family she shouldn't even be charged in the first place, we're so well off we can happily afford to pay for the damages, if she gives him that money they won't be able to afford to go on a honey moon etc etc.\n\nShe then calls me up to harrass me and start's calling me a \"b\\*tch who thinks she's too good for everyone\" and says \"it's a wedding what do you expect? Sorry my people know how to have a good time\".\n\nMy dad gives her 30 days to pay (she was notified about this), 30 days comes and no payment. So my dad get his lawyer to contact SIL explaining how she's being taken to court for not paying.\n\nHer and my MIL have been contacting my husband non stop trying to get him to give her the money. He refuses because he agrees that what she did was irresponsible and wrong.\n\nI had to block MIL and SIL after they sent me nasty messages and even tried to show up at my house to \"talk to me\".\n\nI feel bad that my husbands relationship with his mom and sister is going to be ruined over $1000. But I feel like what she did was wrong and she wasn't even sorry about it.\n\nEDIT: I should also add that my SIL and her husband were given a key to the house to use it and lock it up when they were leaving it. The key was returned to me at my house, the next day I went over to the house which is when I found the damage. \n\nSo they left the house in the condition for me to see with no care in the world.", "created_utc": 1676559428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113si0k/aita_for_taking_legal_action_against_my_sil_for/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, this might be quite a blessing for your husband. His mother and sister are horrible people - they caused actual damages and have insulted you, your father, and your husband for simply asking them to be responsible for themselves. If they choose to step out of his life over this? So much the better.", "NTA. Your SIL fucked around and she found out. Good life lesson for her. Sucks for your husband, but it also shows him how little regard his family has for him.", "NTA She broke your shit and is expecting you to pay because you have more money than her. IDC if shes family or not that is like me straight up just crashing my uncle's car he let me borrow cause I thought it would be fun and then saying ahh whatever you can afford it.", "NTA ur SIL and her husband signed to contract saying that if anything was damaged they would pay and yes its a wedding but no one is that chaotic at a wedding. Good on u and ur dad for taking them to court.\n\nLet us know how it goes with court if you can", "NTA\n\nAll of you should cease contact with SIL and MIL until after the court proceedings\n\nNo settlements\n\nShe needs to pay for a lawyer and handle things like an adult", "NTA, your SIL and BIL are the AH for wrecking the house and apparently not even inviting her own brother (your husband), I may be reading that wrong though. Sure it is mean, but justified to prosecute for what they agreed to, you're just making sure they stick to their agreement.", "NTA. Your SIL is TA. If she wanted to trash the place she should have added a cleaning service. And not used your fathers property. 1500 \u20ac is a very reasonable price. And the cost of the damage is what it is. So - yeah if she is selfish like that, maybe you both are better off without them (so you won't have to pay for family dinner and good presents anymore \\^\\^). \n\nAnd for her maybe forth wedding you know to not let her rent any of your families property ;-)", "Wow, how entitled are they. And NTA, they knew in advance that they were gonna have to pay for damages and that is only normal when you rent a property. I am pretty sure, if they left the place clean and had be super apologetic about the damage, your dad probably would have thought, a well, whatever and not take them to court. Also, you are not taking legal action, your dad is (and rightly so). Just stay out of it and let this be a lesson to never, ever, rent anything out to your family. Tbh, they don't see you as persons, they see you as their private ATM, just go NC with the whole family. Life is just too short for this kind of misery.", "NTA.  This is an obvious NTA.", "NTA. But you need to cut them off.", "In the title, you ask if you are the AH for taking legal action against your SIL. You did not do this, your father did. This sounds more like a rant about an entitled family member vice a situation where you did something and need a judgement.", "NTA. Stay no contact even if the money is paid. If you don't stay NC get separate checks when you go out. As for gifts only as good as you get.", "If they keep harassing you just state that the agreement is between them and your dad and anything further should be said to him. That there is nothing you can do or say as they were aware of the agreement and signed it. \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nThe best thing to do is never mix family and money. You should not have leased your property to her given her poor attitude.\n\nThe second best thing is that when people refuse to pay you a small amount of money owed, it means they can never ask you for money again. Consider that $1,000 the price you paid for your freedom.", "NTA. Hope you took pictures as evidence.", "NTA - but if you can afford it, drop it and just limit contact. The bigger win here will be being done with them, not the $1k.", "INFO I would be inclined to say NTA, BUT you knew she 1) Was an AH 2) Didn\u2019t respect you 3) Was jealous 4) Was petty 5) And thought your family owed her and her family something. I do NOT understand why you didn\u2019t just tell your Dad you thought it was a horrible idea. I mean your Dad is a businessman and has been done this road before( I am sure) Now family is involved. If 1000 can make the whole family leave you alone, I guess it was worth it, but surely you had to have a clue this was going to end badly? I would definitely take her to court. I am just not understanding why you didn\u2019t decline the place from the start.", "How did bed sheets and a vase add up to $1,000?\n\nAlso, why didn't you and your husband attend his sister's wedding?", "NTA!\n\nStage 1) F around. \n\nStage 2) Find out.\n\nSIL is currently in stage 2.", "Info : why did you agree to this whole situation if you knew what was going to happen ?

Why would you make the call to let her have this house in the first place after every piece of evidence you had that it was a bad idea? It\u2019s like you shrugged your shoulders, crossed your fingers and went YOLO.", "**NTA** and don't feel bad at all.\n\nYou aren't ruining your husband's relationship with his sister. Trust me, he knows exactly who she is and always has, which is why he is not upset with you and hasn't been from the beginning. He loves you, he understands what's happening here, and he supports you because he knows that you aren't the morally questionable AH here. To wit:\n\n>She loses her shit and starts going off about how . . . we're so well off we can happily afford to pay for the damages\n\nYup, you are. But what she doesn't seem to understand - as most AHs don't - is that first of all, what you can afford and what is your responsibility are two very different things. I'm sure your family can afford lots of things. That doesn't, in ANY universe, make it your responsibility to pay for nonsense that OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT YOU cause.\n\nMore importantly, the REASON that your family has this kind of money is that your father is a smart businessman who DOESN'T go around just burning his money, paying for things that aren't his to pay for. He didn't cause this damage, your SIL did. The fact that he can afford to pay to fix it is irrelevant. Bill Gates can afford to pay for it too, but she's not asking him for the money, because he's not the one who caused it. Neither is your dad. She and her guests broke it, she pays to fix it.  **Your SIL is getting a very late, very overdue welcome into the world of being a responsible adult.**\n\n>if she gives him that money they won't be able to afford to go on a honey moon etc etc.\n\nThen I guess she probably should have thought of that before she allowed her guests to destroy someone else's property during her wedding without trying to stop them, after signing a contract that included being responsible for damages.\n\n>\r  \nShe then calls me up to harrass me and start's calling me a \"b\\*tch who thinks she's too good for everyone\" \n\nNot everyone, just her. You are, in fact, better than her. Not because of your money, to be clear, but just as a moral, ethical, responsible human being. I always find it hilarious when awful people are like, \"You think you're better than me.\" Yup. Not just think, know. Decent, respectful humans ARE better than her. \n\n>and says \"it's a wedding what do you expect? Sorry my people know how to have a good time\".\n\nI have been to many wonderful, super fun weddings. Not a single one of them resulted in property damage. \"Her people\" weren't \"\\[having\\] a good time, they were behaving like animals. But yeah, I'm sure she's sorry now.\n\nYou are NTA, my friend. Maybe this will be a wakeup call to her, but I doubt it.", "NTA - Husband is better off without those toxic people. If husbands mom is so concerned, she can pay the damages and cleaning fees, otherwise she should shut up.", "NTA, she signed the agreement and fucked up. I feel bad for your husband, he must be extremely embarrassed by his family\u2019s actions. Would love an update too !", "NTA there is a reason you two are family...SIL  is sister IN LAW.  She honors that contact but not another? Besides your dad is not family, his house, his rules. I imagine your dad would be willing for a legally binding contract to put them on a payment plan.", "Family should take even better care of your stuff than strangers.  NTA.  Update us OP, we want to know how plays out later.", "NTA... I hope you have pictures! I think that this may save you money in the end... take a break from taking them out for dinner. Gifts? Maybe something like they get you. This could be the end of the line for the gravey train.", "NTA  \n\n\nFuck around, find out.", "NTA  I hope your Dad follows through with his lawyer.", "NTA. Sorry her people know how to have a good time? Are her people 5? My people know how to have a great time too but also understand you don't destroy others people's property. She signed a contract and disregarded it. The judge will rule in favor of your dad. Let this be a lesson though. Good luck.", "NTA, but this does sound like a petty amount of money to drag someone to court over + the damage it's causing to your husband's relationship with his mom, I'm not really sure that it's worth the effort and stress, do you feel that it is? I would personally let the money go and just under no circumstance ever help SIL with anything again.", "Me too!", "OP isn\u2019t the one suing, it\u2019s OP\u2019s father who has no relation to the SIL. He is the owner of the house that got destroyed.", "What would OP sue her for?", "Depending on the material used, the designer or artisan, and whether or not it\u2019s an antique, even a single vase can cost [more than $1,000](https://www.1stdibs.com/en-gb/furniture/decorative-objects/vases-vessels/vases/).", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s battle, it\u2019s her father that owns the property and is suing. He has no relationship with the SIL except a signed legal document that states that she will pay for damages to the property."]}
