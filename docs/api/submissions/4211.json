In the middle of a discussion with the rest of the family. She passed gas and giggled. The entire family looked at her direction with stern gazes, and some jaw drops.  It was after the 3rd time, I threw my hands and shook my head at her, telling her to go to her room and that her actions were disgusting, rude and not ladylike and she needs to excuse herself to do that. Her father smirked a little and some of the little ones giggled which I told them \"enough. It's not funny.\"\n\nMy daughter apologized and stated that she will be careful, which I then responded that she had the multiple times you belched, smacked during the entire dinner, and farted, she had more than enough time to correct herself. This is unacceptable to be doing this behavior when people are having a meal and I raised her better than this and we will have this conversation later and for now go to her room. She went to her room in tears.\n\nAfter a conversation with my daughter with the behaviors, she apologized again and said that she was trying to make everyone laugh and didnt expect people to get mad. I did remind her that it was actually rude, and she is expected to not do that again with company over.\n\nAfter a conversation with my husband who passes gas very casually(thankfully doesnt do it with company over), he said that I was being too harsh on her and it was just a fart, which I did call him out on him smirking at dinner and stated that she modeled her behavior from him.

You need to make sure she understands that there is a time, and place for everything; and very often what she finds hilarious, may be very offensive for someone else. With your husband giving you crap for it, I'd say turn it back on him. Ask him how he'd feel if he was at his parents' funerals and someone rudely farted in an effort to be funny?  \n\nI know that's a harsh way to put it, but it seems part of the issue is your husband doesn't seem to grasp how offensive that behavior can be.", "NTA. Seems like basic manners to at least say excuse me. Not sit there and giggle.", "NTA. Some people think farts are funny, some don't.  In my opinion it is never funny to fart, or hear or smell a fart, when at a dining table. So i dont think you are the a$$h0le for telling her to stop and sending her away from the table.  Because as you pointed out she had numerous chances to contain her belches but she didnt and she chose to up the ante and fart to get attention, pure and simple.   And by calling her out like you did, it have her attention, negative attention, but attention nonetheless.  I think you couldve corrected her differently in a way that she would remember but without seeming so harsh.\n\nNeurodivergent or not, im sure she knew it was wrong and simply kept misbehaving until she was the focus of attention.  \n\nYou also need to get your husband on board to model appropriate behavior, since she seems to be following in his farting footsteps and even if he conforms he needs to not smirk or laugh at all because. That encourages her misbehavior.", "NTA. Basic social etiquette is an important life skill. You gave her multiple corrections and followed up with a conversation explaining where she went wrong", "NTA there is a difference between involuntary bodily and forcing it for \"humor.\" Her daughter needs to learn that not everyone finds fart jokes funny and that it's inappropriate to intentionally let loose, especially at a family dinner.\n\nShe's 14 and, while I understand that she autistic, most of the population outgrows fart, poop, and gross-out humor by the time they're 10. At a certain point it just ends up being rude and gross and it's better that she finds out now then in the future when she's being ostracized or ridiculed by her peers for being immature.", "NTA unfortunately I am related a bunch of people who think it\u2019s just fine to burp, pass gas, and hock up phlegm with others around. It\u2019s disgusting even when I\u2019m not trying to eat so I\u2019d have appreciated your intervention. One time we were sitting having a conversation and a relative took his shirt off, laid it on the ground and then proceeded to use a foot file on his dry feet to take off excess skin. I still can\u2019t get the sound or image out of my head.", "NTA - You set the very reasonable expectations for behavior at the table and your daughter just kept pushing and pushing as an attention seeking behavior.  She is quite old enough to start learning that being the clown on the stage is not always appropriate.  You pulled her up and she has now had a chance to learn that persistent spotlight seeking can bring less than enjoyable attention.  Your husband isn't doing her any favors by encouraging her as he did, but that's another post.", "NTA if all your children are held to the same level of manners consistently. Also, she admitted she belched and farted on purpose for laughs. Teaching children how to behave in social situations is called parenting. It\u2019s not the same as \u201cnot accepting them for who they are\u201d.  I know a lot of people will come down on you for the \u201cladylike \u201c comment but if you are holding everyone to the same level, you can say \u201cthat is not proper at the dinner table.\u201d  Also, you need to have a talk with you husband and get everyone on the same page for household behavior.", "NTA. A parent\u2019s job is to teach their children how to behave in social situations. You did the right thing.", "All these Y T A  comments are wild, farting at dinner even if it\u2019s an accident is actually disgusting ???? And unhygienic wtf NTA", "NTA. And any vote otherwise is ridiculous. You\u2019re teaching her basic table manners, and it sounds like your sons are held to the exact same standards. No misogyny in your post, except the mistake of describing something as \u201cunlady like\u201d. Anything is lady enough if a woman wants to do it.", "NTA. And here is why. While the belching and farting are in fact, normal bodily functions, they can be triggered on purpose, which she has clearly done. You told your family your expectations for their behavior and manners while company was over, so she knew what she should and shouldn't do. She chose to ignore that and purposely make herself belch and fart unapologetically, as well as smack while she eats. She even knew what she did was wrong, hence why she apologized later. Basic manners are important, and learning them early is normal. At 14 years old she should understand that she should adhere to those manners, especially because you made a point to say so before the guests arrived. And yes, she did have multiple chances to correct her behavior but chose not to. So for those reasons, NTA.", "NTA - It\u2019s common decency if you have to fart, at least try to leave the room if there are other people. \n\nNo one would be confortable eating at a table where someone is constantly farting on purpose.", "NTA. No one wants to have dinner with nasty fart smell and belching and smacking lips happening.

She needs to learn.", "INFO: as a fellow neurodivergent person, I'm wondering if there is a hyperfixation and/or stim aspect of this? are there ways you can engage with this in a positive way? gastroenterology is a whole medical field, so while your daughter's interest isn't appropriate for the dinner table, there are places and contexts where it is. I'm wondering if the table behavior would decrease if there was another outlet where she could explore this interest without shame.\n\nETA: social situations like big family dinners can be extra difficult for a neurodivergent person. your daughter might not always remember not to \"smack\" when she eats or say excuse me every time because there is *so much* to focus on just to show up for the dinner. also it seems like her behavior bothers you the most and it bothers you more than that of the men in your family. your husband \"passes gas freely\" but it's \"not ladylike\" when your daughter does it? did your sons not laugh at farts when they were 14?\n\nexpecting your daughter to not belch and fart throughout family dinner is fine. what's less fine is only responding with punishment when your autistic daughter needs support in social situations.", "I literally do not understand these commenters. NTA. Farting can be smelly, and released POOP particles into the air - NO IT IS NOT OKAY AT DINNER. Even with family. OP explained the expectation before dinner, three strikes, you\u2019re out. Otherwise all the daughter learns is \u201cI can disobey mom because dad thinks it\u2019s funny and what mom tells me is polite doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. This will not be helpful to her, and could seriously mess with her ability to listen and adapt to others across situations as she grows older and has less guidance.\n\nETA: you are an asshole for using \u201cladylike\u201d, and for not making sure you and husband are on the same page. That will be confusing to her.", "NTA  14 is waayyy to old to think this is remotely funny.", "YTA\n\n> not ladylike", "While I dislike your misogyny in expecting her to be \"ladylike\" ( inferring it's ok for boys to do this) ultimately NTA.

She\u2019s lucky you only sent her to her room.", "YTA for two things IMO.. \n\n1) For saying farts aren't \"ladylike.\" \n2) For referring to it as a fart fetish. Ew dude. She's a kid. She's not sexualizing farts.", "The \"not ladylike\" comment makes you instant YTA.", "INFO: are you for real? Not ladylike?", "YTA\n\nThis seems like something you could have handled in a better way.\n\nINFO:  If any of the boys had behaved that way would you have been as angry? \n\nMainly you and Dad need to get on the same page - obviously your husband & all the kids enjoy a good fart joke - most kids go through that phase.  So if your husband is laughing - she's going to keep doing it.  At this point this is what she thinks is very funny - and I'm thinking she was utterly sincere in just wanting everybody to laugh along with her.  \n\nI have no idea on how best to get through to your daughter - you said she's neurodivergent - the way you explain a Rule to your boys may not work for her.  This just may take some extra time. You AND your husband should work together on this.  If you NEVER think farts & burps are funny - you can let her know that, but Acknowledge that everybody has a different sense of humor - so if she and the boys & Dad like to sit around telling fart jokes and 'pull my finger' that's fine. They are a bodily function, everybody farts and burps but that is something you try not to do in front of company especially on purpose.", "NTA. Autism or not, and I am on the spectrum myself, she seems pretty aware of what she's doing, and at a special holiday meal no less. If I'd been a guest, I'd probably have to excuse myself because that is disgusting to have to sit through *while eating*.", "YTA for being so uptight. Like okay, we want to encourage polite behaviour and good table manners. I get it. But honestly, if your family is so judgemental that they can\u2019t deal with a neuro-atypical teenager who happens to be obsessed with farts right now, maybe stop worrying about impressing them and worry about being a supportive parent to your child. Gas is not a big deal. You weren\u2019t dining with royalty as far as I can tell. \n\nBut also bonus YTA for that \u201cladylike\u201d comment.

It's gross and I don't want that happening while I'm eating, but I calmly remind her that that's not okay and she needs to excuse herself if another one is building up. I don't throw my hands up and call her disgusting. She apologizes and we continue our fart-free meal. Nobody has to cry or get mad.\n\nIt seems like you're more embarrassed because you had family over and your kid wasn't perfect than you are about the actual manners here.", "YTA, she said she was trying to make everyone laugh, she clearly doesn't understand that it isn't socially appropriate, you should have given her another chance after having a private conversation with her. And she doesn't have a fart fetish, she probably has a fart special interest.", "YTA.  Ladylike is a bunch of crap and needs to stay in the middle ages where it belongs.  Your daughter is autistic, which means she doesn't understand social cues.  No, farting at the table is not ok, but sending her to her room is too far.", "yeah YTA, everyone farts. get over yourself", "YTA. \n\n\"Not ladylike\" is the comment that does you in, to be honest. \n\nKids push boundaries. Given she is also autistic, I can imagine she is probably prone to pushing them a little more than others might. You overreacted, quite simply. This notion that farts and burps is a gender defined characteristic is mygonistic and frankly needs to be corrected. You're slipping down a dangerous slope. \n\nYes, she probably took it too far. Yes, work can be done to reign it in a bit. But her gender is irrelevant, and you and your family need to relax a little bit. Its gas.

Would you have doled out the same consequences to your sons?", "NTA. I think this is a situation where your daughter is struggling with unspoken social rules. An autistic person doesn't learn social ettiquette intuitively or through trial-and-error like a neurotypical person does. You have to actually explain it to them. You should have a conversation with her where you explain that different kinds of humor aren't appropriate in all situations.

If she wants to make fart jokes, she can do that while privately hanging out with her siblings or her friends.", "NTA. All kids have to learn basic table manners. The only thing that would be unacceptable would be if she were held to a higher standard than the boys. You explained your standards in advance. She knew. She was intentionally pushing your buttons.\n\nContrary to popular belief it is possible for people with autism to learn standards and follow them. If she is verbal and is capable of belching intentionally, she can learn not to.\n\nIf belching or farting at the table is a problem when you don't have company over, start enforcing better standards the rest of the time. If you let the boys get away with it you lose all credibility. Autistic brains don't process double standards well.", "NTA. You warned all of your children with the expectations beforehand and then reprimanded her when other infractions happened that weren\u2019t okay (belching) without severe punishment. She intentionally chose to \u201cbe funny.\u201d While she does have ASD and needs to be explicitly taught social skills, you did that by clearly communicating expectations beforehand.

Soon she will shunned by her peers if she does this outside her home. This is not acceptable in a classroom, in a workplace etc. She needs to learn this now.

No one wants to smell that or hear that when they\u2019re eating. Burping is also kind of gag worthy. Ladylike thing is kinda ew and I think as a society we should move past that term and standard for just women, but yeah her behavior is gross.", "YTA. For so many reasons:\n\n1) What does being ladylike have to do with anything at all? What a terrible thing to reinforce and I hope you ask yourself why you even believe and adhere to this. Also, what would you have said to your sons? Surely not this.\n\n2) Farting? Really? That\u2019s a basic human physiological function/reaction. Why on earth is this banned at all? I understand some people find it unpleasant. But at the end of the day it\u2019s a thing your body does. What do you expect them to do? Run to the bathroom and fart there instead? Is it nice to fart \u201con purpose\u201d? maybe not. But is it something that should result in what you did? Definitely not. \n\n3) You shamed her in front of all her family members. You called her disgusting and rude. If you really want to talk to her, you could just ask her to go to the kitchen with you and talk there. Or, better yet, drop your mindset all together. However, you decide to use anger, fear, and shame to force her to comply in the future. That is truly (in your words) disgusting behavior. \n\nMaybe you\u2019ll say that I had a terrible upbringing and my parents apparently didn\u2019t raise me better, but I just think this is ridiculous.

Your daughter has autism. You can huff and puff all you want about table manners, but as long as your husband and sons are laughing when she farts, she will continue to do it because she believes she is making people happy. At this point, you\u2019re stuck in a loop and it\u2019s your job to get out of it. You need to either sit down with your husband and sons and have an honest conversation about how their reactions need to change and they need to start helping you correct her behavior, OR you need to let it go. _Your daughter is autistic._ You need to work WITH her brain, not against it, because you will lose.\n\nETA this comment section is a cesspool of people who don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care to know how autism works.

It was after the 3rd time, I threw my hands and shook my head at her, telling her to go to her room and that her actions were disgusting, rude and not ladylike and she needs to excuse herself to do that. Her father smirked a little and some of the little ones giggled which I told them \"enough. It's not funny.\"\n\nMy daughter apologized and stated that she will be careful, which I then responded that she had the multiple times you belched, smacked during the entire dinner, and farted, she had more than enough time to correct herself. This is unacceptable to be doing this behavior when people are having a meal and I raised her better than this and we will have this conversation later and for now go to her room. She went to her room in tears.\n\nAfter a conversation with my daughter with the behaviors, she apologized again and said that she was trying to make everyone laugh and didnt expect people to get mad. I did remind her that it was actually rude, and she is expected to not do that again with company over.\n\nAfter a conversation with my husband who passes gas very casually(thankfully doesnt do it with company over), he said that I was being too harsh on her and it was just a fart, which I did call him out on him smirking at dinner and stated that she modeled her behavior from him. A part of me agreed with him, and thought I was too harsh on her and made a big deal over nothing.\n\nWas I being too hard on her reddit?\n\nAITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My brothers have a burping and farting problem, and my mom usually just glares or says knock it off, but the one time I ever accidentally burped in front of her I got sent to my room for not being ladylike. Stuck with me for a long time.", "Agreed. I was at work one day training people. A certain person who shall remain nameless in the middle of the training group just raised his leg and ripped off an extremely loud one. Then acting like nothing had happened at all.\n\nNo class.", "This is perfectly stated. I agree, OP is NTA.", "This part about funeral - you are mixing up pots and pans buddy. Why are you so stuck up just like OP, I mean it\\`s a normal bodily function and it\\`s not like she did it in front of strangers, it was her own family - you know the people with whom you should be actually relaxed and not stiff like wooden Mary.", "I agree totally with this, but I think you\u2019re suggesting OP ask her husband the wrong question. Their daughter is at the age and stage of her learning development where she\u2019s figuring out social norms. While it might be funny to him now, OP should ask her husband if it\u2019ll still be funny to him when she\u2019s 18 or 25 or 32. It can be so much harder for people with autism to pick up on social cues, and it sounds like OP\u2019s husband\u2019s tacit reinforcement is making it that much more difficult.", "Thank you. Seems like a lot of the commenters like the smell of rotted bowel while they eat. smh", "She has autism. \n\nHer father regularly passes gas at the table.", "So it's not unhygienic, but it is off-putting for sure.", "This is dumb. If one of her son\u2019s did it, she probably would have said \u201cnot gentlemanly\u201d (that\u2019s what my mom said to my brothers).\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Op had to get this stern at a family dinner but it doesn\u2019t sound like the original message sunk in, so this may have been necessary.\n\nAlthough, I don\u2019t like embarrassing kids in front of others. It probably would have been better to leave the room with her first to have the conversation.", "No, you are the ah, you simply stopped reading at that point.", "Right?! So much internalized misogyny", "A fetish is an obsessive interest. You the one making it sexual.", "You are the sicko, who said anything about it being sexual?", "That\u2019s you how is no one else saying anting about the fact she called it a fetish", "That would mean ESH except the other family members.", "I\u2019m sorry but how is farting and belching at the table with company \u201cfun\u201d? It\u2019s rude and disgusting. The smell of farts can throw someone off and make them uncomfortable. That\u2019s not how you treat guests, or anyone as a matter of fact.", "Everyone poops too doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s appropriate to do in front of others", "Who wants to smell that when they are trying to eat??", "Oh, it's way better to allow disgusting behavior for the sake of specialness", "I'm with you. \nHow does one hold in a burp? \nShe's setting her daughter up for failure. \n\nThere's an old proverb my Grandpa used to have... \nAfter a burp, he would say, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,  from the bottom of my heart. Had I held it any longer, it would have been a fart\".\n\nPoor daughter!\n\nEdit: you guys do realize this is a 14 year old autistic child who's father is allowed to fart at the table (I'm not sure how one farts casually).\nAlso, OP has yet to answer if the boys are allowed to fart because OP made a huge point about farting and burping being \"unlady like\".", ">What do you expect them to do? Run to the bathroom and fart there instead?\n\nYes, absolutely.", "There's a good chance she would use the term gentlemanly if they were male considering she also describes not liking her husband or boys doing the same behaviors, so I don't think she says that to hold her to a higher standard given the context.", "There's a difference between normal bodily function and trying to get a laugh, which implies forcing of said function.", "If you really need to fart just get up and use the restroom at thanksgiving dinner and rip that fart to your hearts content. Sounds like most people here are reinforcing this bad behavior. Since this wasn\u2019t the first time she should have some consequences", "I totally get that this is a natural function, and is SOMETIMES involuntary. But that doesn't sound like what happened here at all.", "I also saw the term \"ladylike\" as being a pretty generic and shorter way of reminding her to be on her best behavior. It's a expression of behavior, not internalized misogyny.", "There is nothing wrong with being \"ladylike\" or \"gentlemanly\". Unfortunately, too many people feel that having manners these days is some kind of \"toxic\" behavior. Which is incredibly sad.", "But OP said her husband passed gas casually at dinner, just not when there\u2019s company. Mother is very much t a h here.", "Nobody hears the word fetish and thinks of it in a non-sexual context. The correct *medical term* in this case - since she is autistic - is special interest (or hyperfixation).", "She doesn\u2019t want her to hold in burps, just to say \u2018excuse me\u2019 after.", "Yeah! Personally, I don't really care all that much, but to each their own. Regardless of whether or not people think it's gross, maybe instead of expecting that someone doesn't fart (which...how does one just not fart?), communicate that Rosie can step into the bathroom/hallway, fart, and have a giggle to herself out there? Rather than set these unrealistic and unequal expectations, maybe there could've been a way to have Rosie get her fixation in in a way that doesn't interrupt dinner, if it was that big of a deal.", "Have to agree with you.  She was aware of what she was doing.  \n\nI do feel it may have been a good idea to call her away from the table into another room for a few minutes and explain to her why what she was doing was inappropriate before sending her to her room.  Kind of like and official warning.", "I agree.", "Exactly", "No. OP didn't do anything wrong in correcting the behavior and emphasizing the importance.  The dad/husband on the other hand should definitely be modeling better behavior. Sounds like OP ought to be giving him grief as well.", "No, she didn\u2019t. She said he passes gas casually but not with company over.", "Ahh I see, I just assumed that it what OP meant since she did mention daughter is autistic. I definitely didn\u2019t think OP meant sexual fetish and I feel like it was relatively clear from context that\u2019s not what she meant.", "OP literally said she told her kid to hold her burp.\n\nYou say OP didn't want her to hold in her burp.\n\nI'm confused.. Who was there... \n\nYou or OP?", "She was warned and she's 14 not 4. She's old enough to not need an official warning and and explain attention as to why such behavior is unacceptable at the table. She was raised with basic table manners and does know at 14 it's not acceptable so mom giving the look and being told to knock it off once is more than enough.", "I\u2019m sorry- you just repeated exactly what I posted?", "I typically hear the word fixation in regards to obsessive interests of people with autism though.", "Considering that she's the kinda parent who says things like \"not ladylike,\" i wouldn't put it past her accusing her daughter of having a fart kink. Her usage of \"high functioning\" isn't helping her case either - many autistic people firmly believe functioning labels are outdated at best, and oppressive at worst, since the autism spectrum isn't a clear-cut \"most to least autistic\" ranking system.", "Oh yeah my bad I misread", "I have a nephew who used to deliberately belch at the table, he thought it was hilarious.
