I wish I was joking.\n\nI have taught her and our sons table manners. I've been teaching them and reinforcing them since they were little.

Some of these things I tell her each time it's like I told her the first time. \n\nTheir grandparents, aunt and uncle and their younger cousins were invited over to our thanksgiving dinner. I set expectations with the entire family to be on their best behavior, and leave topics regarding bodily functions out of the dinner table.

In the middle of a discussion with the rest of the family. She passed gas and giggled. The entire family looked at her direction with stern gazes, and some jaw drops.  It was after the 3rd time, I threw my hands and shook my head at her, telling her to go to her room and that her actions were disgusting, rude and not ladylike and she needs to excuse herself to do that. Her father smirked a little and some of the little ones giggled which I told them \"enough. It's not funny.\"\n\nMy daughter apologized and stated that she will be careful, which I then responded that she had the multiple times you belched, smacked during the entire dinner, and farted, she had more than enough time to correct herself. This is unacceptable to be doing this behavior when people are having a meal and I raised her better than this and we will have this conversation later and for now go to her room. She went to her room in tears.\n\nAfter a conversation with my daughter with the behaviors, she apologized again and said that she was trying to make everyone laugh and didnt expect people to get mad. I did remind her that it was actually rude, and she is expected to not do that again with company over.\n\nAfter a conversation with my husband who passes gas very casually(thankfully doesnt do it with company over), he said that I was being too harsh on her and it was just a fart, which I did call him out on him smirking at dinner and stated that she modeled her behavior from him.

You need to make sure she understands that there is a time, and place for everything; and very often what she finds hilarious, may be very offensive for someone else. With your husband giving you crap for it, I'd say turn it back on him. Ask him how he'd feel if he was at his parents' funerals and someone rudely farted in an effort to be funny?  \n\nI know that's a harsh way to put it, but it seems part of the issue is your husband doesn't seem to grasp how offensive that behavior can be.", "NTA. Seems like basic manners to at least say excuse me. Not sit there and giggle.", "NTA. Some people think farts are funny, some don't.  In my opinion it is never funny to fart, or hear or smell a fart, when at a dining table. So i dont think you are the a$$h0le for telling her to stop and sending her away from the table.  Because as you pointed out she had numerous chances to contain her belches but she didnt and she chose to up the ante and fart to get attention, pure and simple.   And by calling her out like you did, it have her attention, negative attention, but attention nonetheless.  I think you couldve corrected her differently in a way that she would remember but without seeming so harsh.\n\nNeurodivergent or not, im sure she knew it was wrong and simply kept misbehaving until she was the focus of attention.  \n\nYou also need to get your husband on board to model appropriate behavior, since she seems to be following in his farting footsteps and even if he conforms he needs to not smirk or laugh at all because. That encourages her misbehavior.", "NTA. Basic social etiquette is an important life skill. You gave her multiple corrections and followed up with a conversation explaining where she went wrong", "NTA there is a difference between involuntary bodily and forcing it for \"humor.\" Her daughter needs to learn that not everyone finds fart jokes funny and that it's inappropriate to intentionally let loose, especially at a family dinner.\n\nShe's 14 and, while I understand that she autistic, most of the population outgrows fart, poop, and gross-out humor by the time they're 10. At a certain point it just ends up being rude and gross and it's better that she finds out now then in the future when she's being ostracized or ridiculed by her peers for being immature.", "NTA unfortunately I am related a bunch of people who think it\u2019s just fine to burp, pass gas, and hock up phlegm with others around. It\u2019s disgusting even when I\u2019m not trying to eat so I\u2019d have appreciated your intervention. One time we were sitting having a conversation and a relative took his shirt off, laid it on the ground and then proceeded to use a foot file on his dry feet to take off excess skin. I still can\u2019t get the sound or image out of my head.", "NTA - You set the very reasonable expectations for behavior at the table and your daughter just kept pushing and pushing as an attention seeking behavior.  She is quite old enough to start learning that being the clown on the stage is not always appropriate.  You pulled her up and she has now had a chance to learn that persistent spotlight seeking can bring less than enjoyable attention.  Your husband isn't doing her any favors by encouraging her as he did, but that's another post.", "NTA if all your children are held to the same level of manners consistently. Also, she admitted she belched and farted on purpose for laughs. Teaching children how to behave in social situations is called parenting.

I know a lot of people will come down on you for the \u201cladylike \u201c comment but if you are holding everyone to the same level, you can say \u201cthat is not proper at the dinner table.\u201d  Also, you need to have a talk with you husband and get everyone on the same page for household behavior.", "NTA.

While the belching and farting are in fact, normal bodily functions, they can be triggered on purpose, which she has clearly done. You told your family your expectations for their behavior and manners while company was over, so she knew what she should and shouldn't do. She chose to ignore that and purposely make herself belch and fart unapologetically, as well as smack while she eats. She even knew what she did was wrong, hence why she apologized later. Basic manners are important, and learning them early is normal. At 14 years old she should understand that she should adhere to those manners, especially because you made a point to say so before the guests arrived. And yes, she did have multiple chances to correct her behavior but chose not to. So for those reasons, NTA.", "NTA - It\u2019s common decency if you have to fart, at least try to leave the room if there are other people. \n\nNo one would be confortable eating at a table where someone is constantly farting on purpose.", "NTA.

She needs to learn.", "INFO: as a fellow neurodivergent person, I'm wondering if there is a hyperfixation and/or stim aspect of this? are there ways you can engage with this in a positive way? gastroenterology is a whole medical field, so while your daughter's interest isn't appropriate for the dinner table, there are places and contexts where it is. I'm wondering if the table behavior would decrease if there was another outlet where she could explore this interest without shame.\n\nETA: social situations like big family dinners can be extra difficult for a neurodivergent person. your daughter might not always remember not to \"smack\" when she eats or say excuse me every time because there is *so much* to focus on just to show up for the dinner. also it seems like her behavior bothers you the most and it bothers you more than that of the men in your family. your husband \"passes gas freely\" but it's \"not ladylike\" when your daughter does it? did your sons not laugh at farts when they were 14?\n\nexpecting your daughter to not belch and fart throughout family dinner is fine. what's less fine is only responding with punishment when your autistic daughter needs support in social situations.\n\nETA(again): omg thank you for the awards \ud83d\ude07", "I literally do not understand these commenters.

This will not be helpful to her, and could seriously mess with her ability to listen and adapt to others across situations as she grows older and has less guidance.\n\nETA: you are an asshole for using \u201cladylike\u201d, and for not making sure you and husband are on the same page.

So if your husband is laughing - she's going to keep doing it.  At this point this is what she thinks is very funny - and I'm thinking she was utterly sincere in just wanting everybody to laugh along with her.  \n\nI have no idea on how best to get through to your daughter - you said she's neurodivergent - the way you explain a Rule to your boys may not work for her.  This just may take some extra time. You AND your husband should work together on this.  If you NEVER think farts & burps are funny - you can let her know that, but Acknowledge that everybody has a different sense of humor - so if she and the boys & Dad like to sit around telling fart jokes and 'pull my finger' that's fine. They are a bodily function, everybody farts and burps but that is something you try not to do in front of company especially on purpose.", "NTA. Autism or not, and I am on the spectrum myself, she seems pretty aware of what she's doing, and at a special holiday meal no less. If I'd been a guest, I'd probably have to excuse myself because that is disgusting to have to sit through *while eating*.\n\nEdit: the downvoters must have some kind of scat fetish if they really don't think the idea of smelling someone's shitty gas during dinner is that bad. She's self-aware enough to know what bothers people the most, and goes ahead and does it anyway even after being asked to be on best behavior. What happens when she starts doing this outside the house, in public?", "YTA for being so uptight. Like okay, we want to encourage polite behaviour and good table manners. I get it. But honestly, if your family is so judgemental that they can\u2019t deal with a neuro-atypical teenager who happens to be obsessed with farts right now, maybe stop worrying about impressing them and worry about being a supportive parent to your child. Gas is not a big deal. You weren\u2019t dining with royalty as far as I can tell. \n\nBut also bonus YTA for that \u201cladylike\u201d comment.

I hate it. It's gross and I don't want that happening while I'm eating, but I calmly remind her that that's not okay and she needs to excuse herself if another one is building up. I don't throw my hands up and call her disgusting. She apologizes and we continue our fart-free meal. Nobody has to cry or get mad.\n\nIt seems like you're more embarrassed because you had family over and your kid wasn't perfect than you are about the actual manners here.", "YTA, she said she was trying to make everyone laugh, she clearly doesn't understand that it isn't socially appropriate, you should have given her another chance after having a private conversation with her. And she doesn't have a fart fetish, she probably has a fart special interest.", "YTA.  Ladylike is a bunch of crap and needs to stay in the middle ages where it belongs.

No, farting at the table is not ok, but sending her to her room is too far.", "yeah YTA, everyone farts. get over yourself", "YTA. \n\n\"Not ladylike\" is the comment that does you in, to be honest. \n\nKids push boundaries. Given she is also autistic, I can imagine she is probably prone to pushing them a little more than others might. You overreacted, quite simply. This notion that farts and burps is a gender defined characteristic is mygonistic and frankly needs to be corrected. You're slipping down a dangerous slope. \n\nYes, she probably took it too far.

Would you have doled out the same consequences to your sons?", "NTA. I think this is a situation where your daughter is struggling with unspoken social rules. An autistic person doesn't learn social ettiquette intuitively or through trial-and-error like a neurotypical person does. You have to actually explain it to them. You should have a conversation with her where you explain that different kinds of humor aren't appropriate in all situations.

If she wants to make fart jokes, she can do that while privately hanging out with her siblings or her friends.", "NTA. All kids have to learn basic table manners. The only thing that would be unacceptable would be if she were held to a higher standard than the boys. You explained your standards in advance. She knew. She was intentionally pushing your buttons.\n\nContrary to popular belief it is possible for people with autism to learn standards and follow them. If she is verbal and is capable of belching intentionally, she can learn not to.\n\nIf belching or farting at the table is a problem when you don't have company over, start enforcing better standards the rest of the time. If you let the boys get away with it you lose all credibility. Autistic brains don't process double standards well.", "NTA. You warned all of your children with the expectations beforehand and then reprimanded her when other infractions happened that weren\u2019t okay (belching) without severe punishment. She intentionally chose to \u201cbe funny.\u201d While she does have ASD and needs to be explicitly taught social skills, you did that by clearly communicating expectations beforehand.

Soon she will shunned by her peers if she does this outside her home. This is not acceptable in a classroom, in a workplace etc. She needs to learn this now.

Ladylike thing is kinda ew and I think as a society we should move past that term and standard for just women, but yeah her behavior is gross.", "YTA. For so many reasons:\n\n1) What does being ladylike have to do with anything at all? What a terrible thing to reinforce and I hope you ask yourself why you even believe and adhere to this. Also, what would you have said to your sons? Surely not this.\n\n2) Farting? Really? That\u2019s a basic human physiological function/reaction. Why on earth is this banned at all? I understand some people find it unpleasant. But at the end of the day it\u2019s a thing your body does. What do you expect them to do? Run to the bathroom and fart there instead? Is it nice to fart \u201con purpose\u201d? maybe not. But is it something that should result in what you did? Definitely not. \n\n3) You shamed her in front of all her family members. You called her disgusting and rude. If you really want to talk to her, you could just ask her to go to the kitchen with you and talk there. Or, better yet, drop your mindset all together. However, you decide to use anger, fear, and shame to force her to comply in the future. That is truly (in your words) disgusting behavior. \n\nMaybe you\u2019ll say that I had a terrible upbringing and my parents apparently didn\u2019t raise me better, but I just think this is ridiculous.

In the middle of a discussion with the rest of the family. She passed gas and giggled. The entire family looked at her direction with stern gazes, and some jaw drops.  It was after the 3rd time, I threw my hands and shook my head at her, telling her to go to her room and that her actions were disgusting, rude and not ladylike and she needs to excuse herself to do that. Her father smirked a little and some of the little ones giggled which I told them \"enough. It's not funny.\"\n\nMy daughter apologized and stated that she will be careful, which I then responded that she had the multiple times you belched, smacked during the entire dinner, and farted, she had more than enough time to correct herself. This is unacceptable to be doing this behavior when people are having a meal and I raised her better than this and we will have this conversation later and for now go to her room. She went to her room in tears.\n\nAfter a conversation with my daughter with the behaviors, she apologized again and said that she was trying to make everyone laugh and didnt expect people to get mad. I did remind her that it was actually rude, and she is expected to not do that again with company over.\n\nAfter a conversation with my husband who passes gas very casually(thankfully doesnt do it with company over), he said that I was being too harsh on her and it was just a fart, which I did call him out on him smirking at dinner and stated that she modeled her behavior from him. A part of me agreed with him, and thought I was too harsh on her and made a big deal over nothing.\n\nWas I being too hard on her reddit?\n\nAITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It comes from the work of Hans Asperger, who was a Nazi scientist. He used the phrases \"high functioning\" and \"low functioning\" to describe which neurodivergent prisoners were either fit for forced labor and/or medical experiments (high functioning) or only fit to be removed from the population (low functioning). \n\nI understand that not everyone is aware of the origin of these terms, but if you think about it, you might notice that \"Asperger's\" has largely fallen out of use and it's generally referred to as autism now... It's for exactly the same reason. The community as a whole wants to stop giving credit (and any sense of legitimacy) to a Nazi scientist.\n\nAs someone who is autistic myself, I agree that talking to your daughter about *why* she wanted to make everyone laugh is a good idea. And working together to find more appropriate ways to do that in various situations could be more helpful than just sending her to her room.

We also tend to hyperfixate, and sometimes we can't even control *what* we hyperfixate on. (There's a crochet project for my father that I've been dying to finish for weeks. It's on my shelf, right in front of me and I look at it every day. Still not done. It's 90% done.
