Maybe explain that you would like to spend some quality time with her, and as much as you love your dad, you feel that it would be fun to just have a fun girls trip together. Your dad can take all the suitcases in his car. Regarding the bed situation, is it that the other rooms all have single beds (aka 3 single bed in one room and the queen in the other)? Do you and your siblings get on with Lucy? In any case, the fact that it is always Lucy is not fair, so I wander if there is a reason for this that's all.

In any case you may have to have a sit down and a calm conversation with both your dad and step mum about the way you are feeling. A. K.

The other kids will resent the golden child, and since the children don\u2019t have the power to punish the adults, eventually the golden child will be the one to pay.

If it helps, I thought so even before the additional information about how you bully your younger sister (Life tip:  When your explanation is that the other person in a conflict is \"too sensitive\" or \"doesn't have a sense of humor\", it actually means you're just a dick who lacks empathy and basic communication skills.  You are never not the asshole if your only justification is that the other person is \"too sensitive\".)\n\nFair doesn't have to mean equal, just equitable.  You have a safe and warm ride to the cabin just as everyone else - no one is strapping you to the roof or making you ride unbelted in the bed of a truck.  You have a safe and warm place to lay your head just as everyone else once you get to the cabin - no one is sleeping on the porch in a sleeping bag.  While you may perceive one arrangement as more favorable, it is a fairly equitable arrangement.\n\nHowever, if you don't want to go, then don't go.  Your parents gave you a viable alternative.   \n Perhaps use that to reflect on what it is that you do to contribute to the situation.  If Lucy and your stepmom have a good relationship, but you do not, perhaps there is a reason they don't want you in the car with them and your contentious relationship may be a factor.

Maybe you guys can enjoy eating with just him and not Lucy and stepmom. You Dad definitely needs to one time with all his kids not just Lucy. The fact that he doesn't says a lot about him.\n  I honestly think it's too late to bond with your step mom.  She is  the adult and should have tried with you and sisters especially if they was bullying going on\nThat's on your Dad and her.
