This whole thing is a power play. You can put your foot down. You can establish that you see and refuse to accept your father\u2019s favoritism.

You\u2019ll miss out on that experience entirely. Instead, you\u2019ll spend a much less enjoyable week with your grandparents. I\u2019m not criticizing that choice necessarily.

Now that I\u2019m older, I\u2019ve learned to evaluate whether the scorched earth approach is effective. Ask yourself - will your father care? If you boycott the trip and force a confrontation, do you expect that he\u2019ll finally step up and fix the problem? Or do you think that he\u2019ll just let you ruin your own vacation without bothering to change his behavior? If he\u2019s not looking out for you, then you need to look out for yourself. Evaluate whether this approach will get you what you want and make a decision. It\u2019s also worth noting that you can\u2019t force your stepmother or sister to like you.

Obviously whatever is going on between the siblings relationship is stemmed from parents playing favorites. You simply want your feelings validated and want to be accepted in your own family. Remember to aim it in the right direction at your parents by voicing it in a calm collected way. It hurts to be treated differently and be good to your little sis she can't help being the middle man in your power struggle. Parents aren't perfect we all make mistakes. Enjoy your staycation talk to your grandparents  about how you feel. Hopefully they can guide you or get in your corner and help you voice it. Your not a AH it's complicated not knowing more detail I think there's a little wrong with each side communication being the main problem.", "Yeah strong, strong YTA here\n\nYou\u2019re a snotty teenager, who, with her adult sisters, bullies your poor younger sister, and don\u2019t say it\u2019s \u201cnot bullying\u201d because you said in another comment she goes to therapy 3 times a week and will until her 30\u2019s\n\nYour parents are trying to keep her from feeling worse because you all treat her like crap, no wonder they do that stuff, you guys are probably mean to her and then she can\u2019t enjoy anything until she goes on trips where your parents can keep an eye on you\n\nI don\u2019t care that you\u2019re a kid that thinks she\u2019s right, actions have consequences and when you\u2019re older hopefully you\u2019ll see the error of your ways", "Makes sense when I saw your comment about \u2018teasing\u2019 but \u2018not bullying\u2019 your sister.\nI\u2019d say YTA and they treat her like that because of how you and your sisters treat her.\nThis is a case of: when a bully gets upset with consequences. \n\nYou should have mentioned the bullying in the post. Your misleading everyone", "Wow. I recommend reading OP\u2019s comments on this post because they\u2019re really enlightening. OP seems to have a victim complex and a vendetta against Lucy. They wrote this post in a way to support their own agenda, but after reading the comments I concur that YTA big time. Maybe you should look into therapy for yourself, your behaviour is awful, you should be ashamed", "At first i was on OP's side, but after reading the comments? YTA \n\nif your younger sister it's \"too sensitive\" and \"can't stand a little teasing\" then why do you continue?? If it happens once or twice, ok it can be that you were trying to play and didn't went the right way. But after knowing it affects her? It becomes bullying. I don't know exactly what you do to her, but if you know it affects her emotionally and yet you continue to do it, you are mistreating your sister\n\nAnd after reading your comments it sounds you are angry that she needs therapy? The way you speak about her and the way you say she'll \"be in therapy until she's thirty\", you sound like a bully, it's a really cruel way to speak about your little sister knowing she has issues. Sounds like your dad and step mom are trying to protect her from you and your sisters.", "YTA since you and  the older siblings  abuse the younger sister by bullying her.  So you and the other older siblings are the assholes.  You\u2019ve decided she is too sensitive and should just put up with your abuse.  Your parents are trying to protect her from the hellish existence of constant so-called teasing (bullying, abuse).  Good for your parents.     \n\nFor those wondering where the info about bullying came from:  she has posted this story elsewhere, too. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z937qy/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_vacation_until_my_dad/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "Look at OP's comments, the father would probably be glad if she did stay away.", "Other comments from OP mentions relentlessly teasing younger sister from young age.", "Which after the response make it even worse, Lucy found her BIO mom DEAD at 3! And yet step mom is protecting her even though she isn't Lucy's bio mom. Means this isn't teasing this is full on bullying for a step mom to take sides with a kid that isn't hers.  \nActually sounds like step mom is a good parent to Lucy.", "Part of it was Lucy was the one who was there when bio mom died, and was 3 at the time, so major AH move to be bullying her whether its soley about that or that AND other things.", "Honest question, how do you suggest het father deal with it? He clearly can't keep the girls together without traumatizing Lucy. OP makes it clear their bullying is 'no big deal' so they're clearly not gonna stop", "Read OP's comments, dad and stepmum are trying to protect Lucy from OP.", "No, she is trying to keep Lucy away from the other 3 because they bully her.", "It's in one of the comments.", "That\u2019s the point, OP!!! \n\nThey have to protect her from you and your sister!", "Ooh. Good catch.", "That\u2019s a good mom!", "I read those and edited the judgment. OP made those comments and accepted that she and her sisters bully lucy after I had made my comment.", "I keep seeing this said but can\u2019t find a link to OP saying it. Can someone link me?", "Sounds like not only are they bullies but may also be incredibly irresponsible", "Thanks!", "Likely given the context. But Lucy could also be the golden child and anyone who doesn\u2019t bow to her would automatically be the A hole. Just because a lot of people think one child is an Angel doesn\u2019t make it true. Macaulay Culkin in \u201cThe Good Son\u201d taught me that one.", "You sure have a lot of answers for why it can\u2019t possibly be your fault that a division e is it\u2019s with your sister. \n\nHave you considered that subjecting a \u201csensitive\u201d person to further abuse isn\u2019t the way to handle that particular issue? Like how do you see her getting upset over your poor treatment of her and think she\u2019s the problem? \n\nWhat because other people don\u2019t make you physically and immediately aware that you\u2019re being mean to them? What is the logic behind \u201cshe\u2019s just too sensitive\u201d?

Those are nice memories to have :) I used to play cards with both sets of GP but on my paternal side they passed a long time ago but I still remember playing cards with them and them teaching me how to play and getting excited at the game! But I still play cards with my maternal grandma when I visit :)", "Out of curiosity, how often are you discussing bunk bed quantities with your neighbors?", "Lol, I don't. I had a bunk bed as a kid. Maybe I'm just different because my parents separated the bunk bed into two different bed, and still called it bunk beds. So I kind of just associated each bed as one bunk bed, even though they weren't technically set up as bunks. 2 bunk beds in my head are two beds in a single bunk. It's probably just me.", "There are 3 assholes here, OP: You, Allie, and Michelle.\n\nI read the comments you made in the replies here. You three are bullying your youngest sister, and your father and stepmother know that.\n\nYou're bullying your youngest sister. Who's in therapy. Because she was alone with your mother when she died. Gross. Grow the hell up.\n\nYTA.", "After your comments, come on; you know you're a bully. You are the bane and trouble of your sisters life. You do nothing but torment your sister for what? To make yourself feel good? Make it seem like you're not what you know you are? Perhaps I'll agree: there is some favoritism involved. But when it's between a bullied young girl to you and the other 'sisters' , it's apparent why they want to help her. Whether you see her as a sister or not, I don't care; you're just a bully, whether you admit it or not. YTA", "YTA. You're also entitled, a gaslighting jerk (\"too sensitive\" is a very VERY common tactic of gaslighters, they incorrectly think it gives them cover to be a dick), immature, and in general a trash human being. \n\nYour parents are paying for the vacation, so they can make whatever rules they want. They say you have to share a twin bunk bed with 2 other equally shitty sisters? Those are the rules. Don't like it? Don't go. They do not OWE you a vacation that adheres to your wishes. Plus, they are apparently protecting Lucy FROM YOU.\n\nThink long-term here. Your older sisters are very likely to move out before you. Have you considered, if you stick to your guns on the bullying, what it will be like in the house when it's just you, your Dad, your step-mom, and Lucy? You will have no allies in that house. You will be the outsider. Deservedly so, IMO, but if you don't want a few years of discomfort i.e. reaping what you sow, take a good, long look in the mirror and figure out how to not be a massive, flaming asshole.", "NTA and don\u2019t go- that means they all ride together and can suffer your dads music and no stops.", "YTA I think you and your sisters need therapy cause you guys severely lack any sort of empathy. \"She was 3 and probably doesn't remember/understand what happened.\" So you think she's going to therapy for fun? To inconvenience your family? Grow up.

You're making fun of her, you're teasing her and she's in therapy. Your parents are protecting her for you because you're monsters to her\n\nAnd you hides what's really happening in your post on purpose just to pass as a victim.\n\nYTA, you should be ashamed", "This is just sad and unfortunate.  It sucks when parents pick a favorite like their betting on a horse.  They always lose the rest of their children on this particular gamble.", "YTA. You bully her.
