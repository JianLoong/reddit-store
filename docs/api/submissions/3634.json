Remember that ur stepmom and dad's behavior is much more damaging to Lucy in the long term than it is to the three of you older girls, although it's an awful and frustrating thing to be living through. Lucy probably already has a distorted sense of reality, and without intervention she could grow up into an adult that no one will tolerate.

That should be older child privileges! You tried sitting down with your mum and trying to explain how you all feel?", "NAH - your older sisters and you are raising your parents' awareness. You are attempting to get fair treatment, and they are attempting to balance the scales. None of you are choosing ways that really work to get what you need and want.  \n\nYou've explained in a comment that your parents think that the older three siblings bully and tease the youngest sibling, and that the youngest sibling is sensitive. Your parents are trying to compensate for the teasing that you experience as harmless but Lucy experiences as serious. Little kids don't know the difference between teasing and bullying. And every individual experiences the same things differently. \n\nIt sounds like you really do want to go the cabin, and you don't want to stay with your grandparents the whole week. Even if the treatment Lucy receives is unfair, what ways could you and your sisters enjoy your week, and where would it be the most enjoyable for you? Don't dig yourself into a ditch - keep expressing how you feel, what you need (fairness), and what you want (rotate beds), but don't turn your reasonable requests into demands. Just keep pointing out what's fair and what's not. Your parents are capable of learning and adapting if you show them that you can be reasonable and adapt, too.", "NTA! \nAnd this the reason most kids will go NC with their parents, In this case 3 daughters!", "NTA at all. You deserve the same treatment Lucy gets, full stop. Is stepmom mom to anyone of your sisters, like Lucy perhaps?

Have you would ask your stepmum why you can't go with her and Lucy (what is the reasoning?)? Do you have a good relationship outside holidays, do you try to have a good relationship with her? Because if normally you don't get on, and Lucy is the only one who she get along with, she might not want to be with you and your siblings for hours in the car if you are not going to be nice to her. I am not saying that this right what she is doing but that if could be an explanation. Maybe explain that you would like to spend some quality time with her, and as much as you love your dad, you feel that it would be fun to just have a fun girls trip together. Your dad can take all the suitcases in his car. Regarding the bed situation, is it that the other rooms all have single beds (aka 3 single bed in one room and the queen in the other)? Do you and your siblings get on with Lucy? In any case, the fact that it is always Lucy is not fair, so I wander if there is a reason for this that's all. Is your biological mum still around, could she be an option instead of your grand parents? In any case you may have to have a sit down and a calm conversation with both your dad and step mum about the way you are feeling. A. K. A \"I feel...when\", but you will also have to listen to them, or you can write a letter, however you must remain calm and collected if you want any chance to be heard.

The other kids will resent the golden child, and since the children don\u2019t have the power to punish the adults, eventually the golden child will be the one to pay. It\u2019s hurting the \u201cfavorite\u201d and her potential to have a decent relationship with her siblings every bit as much as it is hurting the other children.\n\nHaving said that, you said you guys tease her just like you do each other but she\u2019s too \u201csensitive\u201d. Cut that out. She is younger than all of you at an age where those years make quite a bit of difference. It\u2019s a sensitive, difficult age.
