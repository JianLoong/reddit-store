I didn't laugh and she rubbed her hands while saying ' you won't get rid of me that easily' like some evil cartoon character, which wasn't funny at all. I told her she was invading my space. She said she was around the neighborhood and spontaneous visits are a form of generosity. I told her she needed to leave.

She's not. She's very needy and high maintenance because she needs to always be sorrounded by people. We have different styles and maybe she didn't do it on purpose. My life has taken a huge spike in  my career, income and financial situation. I don't think she's struggling but she's very stagnant and may be unhappy. While I didn't want company, maybe I should have create an excuse so that we both left my place and I could just come back alone instead of just asking her to leave?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s even more rude when the person makes it clear they are not wanting visitors or have plans. And on Valentine\u2019s Day? What if you had plans? Was she expecting to join in for threesome?", "NTA. Not sure why she thought it was okay to show up since you guys are not besties anymore . I hate it when people invite themselves in, call first. So you're  not the AH.", "NTA \n\nHow did you humiliate her?\n\nTo be humiliated you need an audience!!!! She humiliated herself by pushing herself into your space then blabbing to everyone. \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to privacy", "NTA. Even if you were still close you are not *required* to share your space and time with anyone unless you have a kid. She ain\u2019t your kid and she needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nGood for you. She sounds annoying and oblivious. Glad you stayed strong for yourself! \n\nAny humiliation that may or may not have occurred had naught to do with you. \n\nHope you are enjoying your treats!", "NTA.  I'd consider blocking her and any of her friends who scolded you.  I hope you had a good evening anyway!", "NTA at all! People who drip by unannounced and uninvited deserve to be kicked out.", "NTA.  Spontaneous visits are a form of generosity? No one needs that level of idiocy in their life.", "NTA. She really sounds like a royal pain in the ass.", "You're NTA. She was the one being presumptuous, demanding, and rude. Good for you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA - She is rude", "NTA. Block these people who tell you are wrong, too. She humiliated herself.", "WTH? Who just shows up so someone's house unannounced, on a holiday?? NTA.", "NTA NTA NTA. Have a wonderful evening to yourself and don\u2019t even think about any opinions that suggest you need to put up with somebody literally pushing themselves into your evening.", "She wouldn\u2019t have been humiliated if she hadn\u2019t told all her other friends about what happened, she would have had mild embarrassment that was kept between the 2 of you.

I would tolerate that for about .05 seconds. \n1. Sorry, I'm busy. \n2. Please leave. \n3. Imma throw you out on your ass. \n4. Tell the other person to STFU.", "NTA, she sounds like she has boundary issues and her inability (or unwillingness) to recognize boundaries leads her to hurt her own feelings when she realizes that acting chummy while barging into someone\u2019s space isn\u2019t an effective reconciliation tactic.", "NTA -  Uninvited creeps not going to listen to boundaries the only healthy thing to do IS to insist they leave.   Now was she actually humiliated or just telling people what happened in an effort to make you look bad and get attention?    \n\n\nSorry she was so rude, and you don't owe it to anybody to act like them invading your personal space/time/plans is allowable.

Your comment made my day!!", "Honestly, she humiliated herself by pushing to the point she had to be told to leave.", "Yes I am!", "I am! I felt off but knowing that maybe I wasn't the AH is helping my mood!", "She seems like an overbearing person. You\u2019re in the clear.
