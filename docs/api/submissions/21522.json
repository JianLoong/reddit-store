We have 3 kids (6M, 4F, 1M) and we live pretty close to our hometown and so we have lifelong friends that we see regularly as well as friends we have made in our new town, coworkers, college, etc. It would be fair to say our friends come from many different backgrounds. We have friends that span the political spectrum and friends who are part of the LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC communities. I hate to put it this way but I think the context for the guests is important to understand the actions that I took.  It is not to say that if all my guests were white, cis, and straight, I would have felt differently but I stood firm on my decision primarily because I felt I needed to protect my friends.   Today\u2019s political climate in the US coupled with social media, it is easy to see how people feel. \n\n   \nI have a friend, Bill (40s M), who can be outspoken about his feelings. To be fair, I only know this because of social media. I also know that I have other friends who support/vote for the same people as him but are less vocal and who I don\u2019t believe have the same radical views.  If I am being honest, they probably don\u2019t really pay attention to some of the radical stuff because we live in a blue state.\n\n    \nThat brings us to our 4th of July party on Saturday.

When sending out invites, I skipped over this person because I could not get over some of the heinous things that he has posted.  I was thinking about some of my friends and their families that I believe would be judged (probably silently) and just could not do it.  The problem is his sister and cousin their families were invited.  \n\n  \nI did not mention his family\u2019s absence from the party but I know some people noticed (especially his family).  No one said anything and no one seemed upset or left early.  I knew I would most likely see him in the near future but I ended up seeing him when we rafted up on our boat with his sister on Tuesday.  Most of the day was fine but when he directly asked me where his invite was, I told him that I was concerned about his views and his feelings about certain groups.  He was surprised by this and said that he didn\u2019t realize I \u201chated free speech.\u201d I countered that I still believe he has the right to believe what he wants and say what he wants but I do not have to open my home (and friends) to his judgment/hostility. He posted about it on his social media that night and now people are divided.\n\n  \nMy husband thinks I\u2019m a hypocrite because I most likely invited other \u201cRepublicans\u201d as he put it but I do not think being a Republican and being a hateful person are the same thing.

Free speech protects people from being arrested for expressing their opinions and views. That's it. It doesn't mean that you will face zero *social* consequences for  the things you say, especially if what you say is hateful, ignorant, racist, etc... \n\nNTA.

Your party, your guest list.", "NTA Ugh, I hate it when people get \u201cfree speech\u201d wrong. Free speech only applies to government, that would include public spaces, censorship. Is your house and your 4th of July party the government or a public place? No. But ignoring Bill\u2019s ignorance of the First Amendment, you can invite whoever and not invite whoever you want, whether you just hate the person or don\u2019t want them running their mouths off and hurting someone in the process. Good for you for shutting down what could have been an awkward or disastrous situation.", "Ah the paradox of tolerance.\n\nNTA.\n\nYou're not obliged in any way to invite someone to your home.", "NTA\n\nFirst and foremost, your house, your party, you get to choose. End of story.\n\nSecond, the first ammendment protects citizens from government retaliation.

Even if he only does it online, I wouldn't want him at my party.\n\nAs for your husband, do tell him that the republicans you invited know when something isn't appropriate, and that's why you're all still friends.  \n\n\nETA: NTA.", "Free speech means the government can\u2019t come arrest you for expressing your opinion, it does not mean people have to invite assholes to their parties. \n\nYour mistake here was making it about posting political things when it\u2019s about posting heinous things.

He has the right to free speech, and you have the right to freedom of association. You don't have to associate or spend your leisure time with bigoted jerks.", "NTA.  Free speech means he won\u2019t be thrown into jail by the government for what he says.  It does not mean a freedom from consequences like becoming a social pariah.", "NTA.

I\u2019m curious however why you describe him as a friend?", "What kind of stuff does he post?", "NTA\nBigotry, even if it's just internet posts, is a form of violence. You protected your friends, and that's more important than babying this bigot. Stand your ground on this one", "NTA. I'm a generation x liberal and there is a huge difference between free speech and hate speech. I cannot stand when I hear people scream \"free speech\" to cover hate.", "NTA\n\nPeople have no idea what free speech means and it shows \ud83d\ude44", "So the difference is his views are hating people for existing. He doesn't get to whine about free speech when he's seeing the consequences of using it. It's not harsh to protect harmless people from harmful ones. Nta", "NTA. His speech means that you no longer want to be around him, you don't want to be associated with him, and you don't want your other guests to feel unsafe in your home because of his presence in it. That's simple enough.\n\nFree speech doesn't mean free of social consequences, just that the government can't penalize you for speech that doesn't actively endanger others. You are not the government, so you can give him all the social consequences of being an AH you want.\n\nAnd all Republicans aren't radical bigots. Just like all Democrats aren't associated with Antifa. There are certainly correlations there, but correlation is not causation. So invite all the Republicans you want, so long as they don't make you or your other guests feel unsafe or unwelcome. Very easy.", "I think you're a hypocrite for considering Bill a friend. You only don't want to be his friend when his views might shame you in front of your other friends, when in reality, if you are any kind of an ally, you would not even be friends with a person who holds his views.", "INFO: Did you invite those other friends who vote/support the same people as Bill does to the party?\n\nEdited to add: Also, you mentioned you don\u2019t think they have the same radical views as Bill. Do you think that because you\u2019ve had direct conversations with them about their views.", "Yea you are, because he never once said or did anything toward and you invited other republicans.

Having that barrier of perceived anonymity does wonders for lowering your filter.", "He probably wears it as a badge of honour, as many of his ilk do.", "Why are you still friends with him?", "If your viewpoints are so divergent, why pretend he is a friend at all?", "I think your intentions to protect your LGBTQ+ and/or BIPOC  friends are good and you certainly don\u2019t have to invite anyone to your house if you don\u2019t want them there.   \nBill obviously is an AH. Big time.   \nYour heart is in the right place, but I\u2019m not sure you\u2018re being consistent. Just because people don\u2019t say hateful things out loud doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t thinking it. At the very least, it doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t be silently judging your LGBTQ+ and/or BIPOC friends. Without having a direct (and respectful) conversation about their views with the friends who support/vote the same way Bill does, you don\u2019t actually know whether or not they would be judging your LGBTQ+ and/or BIPOC friends. It\u2019s easy to condemn the people who are loud with their hate (like Bill), but the people who are quietly complicit in hate are just as bad. So, if your issue (as you stated) is that you didn\u2019t want people at your party judging some of your other friends, then I think you should dig in a bit more and start having some direct, friendly and likely lively conversations. I applaud you for protecting your LGBTQ+ and/or BIPOC friends from Bill\u2019s hate; I just think you need to go a step further.  \nNTA", "Thank you for being respectful.", "I don't speak for, or to you. You use slurs, and I don't appreciate that.", "Bro cutting off is not a virtue. Cultivate more connections.", "You even admitted some of the people you invited likely voted for evil right wingers and you let them come. At least he is honest about his beliefs, the others are secretly hating.", "If you feel uncomfortable around this guy, and don't want to invite him to gatherings, then you don't really consider him a friend. You're NTA for not inviting him as it was your party, but the fallout is inevitable. Good luck dealing with him and his family.", "take my pretend award my dude \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "Is it really a purity test if the bar is \"this person regularly publicly posts heinous stuff that would make BIPOC and LGBTQ people uncomfortable?\" It's a low bar and this guy is still her trusted friend, not an acquaintance.", "You sound terminally online, and please stop using slurs.", "Almost as bad as vegans and eating body parts...", "We are family friends so the most interaction I have with him is when we are at family events which are usually hosted by his family because my parents downsized their home a few years ago and my husband and I only bought our home (we always lived in an apartment) last year.", "Perhaps, but I like to think that coming to my fabulous parties and rubbing elbows with my diverse and colorful friends is part of keeping them from getting sucked down into the whirlpool of jingoistic xenophobic, FOX- fed weirdness. And they are welcome to think that me coming to their parties might open my mind to accepting Jesus Christ as my personal Savior or whatnot.", "I don't think I was pretending.  I am capable of being in the same room with him at his sister's, parent's, or cousin's houses but that doesn't mean I have to invite him to mine.  I think the expectation was that they are all a package deal.  I feel differently.", "\u201cAsk everyone their political affiliation before every event you host, and don\u2019t invite anyone with views you don\u2019t agree with\u201d is a hell of a take. I think OP probably handled it correctly, if you had your way the country would literally dissolve lmfao.", "I would never suffer you.", "I see your point here but it's a fine line between refusing to host a proven unapologetic bigot and another to refuse hospitality to someone you only wonder may have the same views but don't know for sure and have no real way to find out because OP isn't entitled to anyone's opinions if they are not comfortable speaking about them, and should not cut them off a hypothetical guest list simply because they politely declined to discuss a topic. If they haven't been vocal about their views, have been accepting of others publicly and haven't made others a target, then a gathering that includes these people and LGBTQ could be extremely enlightening for all.", "What slur did I use?", "having connections with shit people is also not a virtue. quality over quantity", "I don't think everyone who votes one way or another is evil, misguided maybe but I firmly believe that other people who may share his party may fall into the latter.", "That\u2019s bad too. Turning a blind eye until affects you or someone you care about doesn\u2019t make you a good person or citizen. If they are only voting Republican because that is their \u201cteam\u201d, instead of paying attention to what and who they are actually enabling, there is a problem. \n\nYou know that poem, First They Came\u2026?", "Oh, I guess it\u2019s complicated if you\u2019re friends with his people.", "Right? Some of these comments have me feeling very grateful that my friends with different views aren't that close minded.", "If that\u2019s how you want to interpret what I said, so be it.", "I\u2019m ok with that.", "Mmm strongly disagree bro. I\u2019d say the ability to connect with people you disagree with is a virtue, including some shit people. And calling them shit people is actually a way to dehumanize them and act like you don\u2019t have to listen to them. Basically, lend an ear to everyone because we\u2019re all people, but make your own decisions.", "I totally understand and agree which is why I do not turn a blind eye but I cannot convince my friends to care the way I can.  I have friends who will attend protests to those who don't bother voting at all.", "You\u2019re the one that seems to be dividing people into groups and \u201ccoming for them\u201d", "Forreal I just commented on the wrong post. My bad.", "Nah man the less bigots around me the better. Listen, I'm happy to talk with people who might disagree on certain things, but not about whether certain groups of people should have the right to exist. Sorry not sorry but there is honestly no benefit to, for example, having a Nazi around, and you'll just make everyone else who falls into the groups they're bigoted against uncomfortable", "Lol. That\u2019s funny. No worries."]}
