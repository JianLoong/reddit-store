We have 3 kids (6M, 4F, 1M) and we live pretty close to our hometown and so we have lifelong friends that we see regularly as well as friends we have made in our new town, coworkers, college, etc. It would be fair to say our friends come from many different backgrounds. We have friends that span the political spectrum and friends who are part of the LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC communities. I hate to put it this way but I think the context for the guests is important to understand the actions that I took.  It is not to say that if all my guests were white, cis, and straight, I would have felt differently but I stood firm on my decision primarily because I felt I needed to protect my friends.   Today\u2019s political climate in the US coupled with social media, it is easy to see how people feel. \n\n   \nI have a friend, Bill (40s M), who can be outspoken about his feelings. To be fair, I only know this because of social media. I also know that I have other friends who support/vote for the same people as him but are less vocal and who I don\u2019t believe have the same radical views.  If I am being honest, they probably don\u2019t really pay attention to some of the radical stuff because we live in a blue state.\n\n    \nThat brings us to our 4th of July party on Saturday.  It is the first we have hosted since we moved back to the area from the city last year.  When sending out invites, I skipped over this person because I could not get over some of the heinous things that he has posted.  I was thinking about some of my friends and their families that I believe would be judged (probably silently) and just could not do it.  The problem is his sister and cousin their families were invited.  \n\n  \nI did not mention his family\u2019s absence from the party but I know some people noticed (especially his family).  No one said anything and no one seemed upset or left early.  I knew I would most likely see him in the near future but I ended up seeing him when we rafted up on our boat with his sister on Tuesday.  Most of the day was fine but when he directly asked me where his invite was, I told him that I was concerned about his views and his feelings about certain groups.  He was surprised by this and said that he didn\u2019t realize I \u201chated free speech.\u201d I countered that I still believe he has the right to believe what he wants and say what he wants but I do not have to open my home (and friends) to his judgment/hostility. He posted about it on his social media that night and now people are divided.\n\n  \nMy husband thinks I\u2019m a hypocrite because I most likely invited other \u201cRepublicans\u201d as he put it but I do not think being a Republican and being a hateful person are the same thing.  The sister gets why I did it but does feel like maybe it was harsh and believes he would not have confronted anyone.  Many of my friends are happy I stood up for them.

Free speech protects people from being arrested for expressing their opinions and views. That's it. It doesn't mean that you will face zero *social* consequences for  the things you say, especially if what you say is hateful, ignorant, racist, etc... \n\nNTA. You were protecting your friends and you are under no obligation whatsoever to entertain or coddle bigots.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry, but if someone screams about free speech, they only care about what their speeches not other peoples your friend sounds like a bore", "NTA. You may have invited other Republicans, you just didn't invite mouthy AHs who can't keep their opinions to themselves in mixed company. Your party, your guest list.", "NTA Ugh, I hate it when people get \u201cfree speech\u201d wrong. Free speech only applies to government, that would include public spaces, censorship. Is your house and your 4th of July party the government or a public place? No. But ignoring Bill\u2019s ignorance of the First Amendment, you can invite whoever and not invite whoever you want, whether you just hate the person or don\u2019t want them running their mouths off and hurting someone in the process. Good for you for shutting down what could have been an awkward or disastrous situation.", "Ah the paradox of tolerance.\n\nNTA.\n\nYou're not obliged in any way to invite someone to your home.", "NTA\n\nFirst and foremost, your house, your party, you get to choose. End of story.\n\nSecond, the first ammendment protects citizens from government retaliation. Freedom of speech does not guarantee freedom from consequences, especially in private residences. \n\nChances are this dude would've shown up, gotten drunk, and been an absolute terror for your noncis, non white, non straight friends", "Freedom of speech limits the government from regulating speech.  You get to decide what goes on in your home.  If he\u2019d said he only posts these ideas on social media, he wouldn\u2019t spout them at a party, I MIGHT suggest you cut him some slack.  But no, he doubled down with a fictitious right to insult your guests.  NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your party, invite who you want.\n\nAlso \u201cfree speech\u201d means you can say what you want without getting arrested, it doesn\u2019t mean there are no consequences to that speech.", "NTA, \u201cfree speech\u201d does not mean you are free from consequences. If you want to put out an image of yourself into the world as a hateful person then you should be prepared to be treated as a hateful person.", "NTA.

He honestly must be too dumb to understand this.

Perfectly legitimate reason.", "NTA\n\nAs you said, your house your rules. You could have put a caveat in the invite, about either no politics or hate speech will not be tolerated. But if this person says hateful stuff, I wouldn't invite him either. It's drama looking for a place to happen if you invite him.", "NTA. He has the right to free speech, and you have the right to freedom of association. You don't have to associate or spend your leisure time with bigoted jerks.", "NTA.  Free speech means he won\u2019t be thrown into jail by the government for what he says.  It does not mean a freedom from consequences like becoming a social pariah.", "NTA. You were protecting your family and friends from his hateful views. You couldn\u2019t guarantee if he came he wouldn\u2019t voice his opinions and truly harm your family/friends.

Unfortunately, the First Amendment (which is about government restrictions and NOT regarding private business or your own home) gets misused often because what people really want is freedom from consequences, not \"free speech.\" \n\nIn addition, it's in the First Amendment that you can't incite violence. This also includes defamation, obscenity, fraud, child porngraphy, and threats. \n\nYour friend uses the word but doesn't know what it means.

I\u2019m curious however why you describe him as a friend?", "What kind of stuff does he post?", "NTA\nBigotry, even if it's just internet posts, is a form of violence. You protected your friends, and that's more important than babying this bigot. Stand your ground on this one", "NTA. I'm a generation x liberal and there is a huge difference between free speech and hate speech. I cannot stand when I hear people scream \"free speech\" to cover hate.", "NTA\n\nPeople have no idea what free speech means and it shows \ud83d\ude44", "So the difference is his views are hating people for existing. He doesn't get to whine about free speech when he's seeing the consequences of using it. It's not harsh to protect harmless people from harmful ones. Nta", "NTA. His speech means that you no longer want to be around him, you don't want to be associated with him, and you don't want your other guests to feel unsafe in your home because of his presence in it. That's simple enough.\n\nFree speech doesn't mean free of social consequences, just that the government can't penalize you for speech that doesn't actively endanger others. You are not the government, so you can give him all the social consequences of being an AH you want.\n\nAnd all Republicans aren't radical bigots. Just like all Democrats aren't associated with Antifa. There are certainly correlations there, but correlation is not causation. So invite all the Republicans you want, so long as they don't make you or your other guests feel unsafe or unwelcome. Very easy.", "I think you're a hypocrite for considering Bill a friend. You only don't want to be his friend when his views might shame you in front of your other friends, when in reality, if you are any kind of an ally, you would not even be friends with a person who holds his views.", "INFO: Did you invite those other friends who vote/support the same people as Bill does to the party?\n\nEdited to add: Also, you mentioned you don\u2019t think they have the same radical views as Bill. Do you think that because you\u2019ve had direct conversations with them about their views.", "Yea you are, because he never once said or did anything toward and you invited other republicans. Playing white knight tends to make people act hypocritically. And the fact you didn\u2019t ban all right wingers and just him is not cool.", "YTA. The worst you can say about this guy is he\u2019s wrong. You stated you wouldn\u2019t have known these things about him if he hadn\u2019t posted on social media. This indicates that he hasn\u2019t acted poorly towards others in your peer group. If any of your other friends posted angry stuff about white, cis, straight people would you not have invited them? If not inviting him was just a means of demonstrating your virtue to your other friends then you should be honest with yourself and him by indicating he is not your friend because of how you feel. You can\u2019t use holding back friendship as a means to punish someone you disagree with. If you do, you\u2019re not being a friend. If you were his friend you\u2019d just tell him you saw his posts and that they bother you. Talk to the guy if you value his friendship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The insulting insinuations is the part you should be apologising for.", "Nope."]}
