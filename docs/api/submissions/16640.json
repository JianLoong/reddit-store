His mother lives out-of-state, so I've only met her three times.\n\nThe other times I've visited, she's been invasive and inappropriate. She'll ask a bunch of questions about money, sex, and our plans for children. I've told her I wasn't going to answer, so she's called me \"sleazy\" and \"cheap\".\n\nShe also doesn't believe that anybody in her house deserves any privacy. She's barged into our room without knocking. And I'm pretty sure she's gone through our suitcases.\n\nI brought it up with my husband, and he said she's \"a snoop\" and \"just kind of a problem person\". But my husband thinks that because we live in a different state, it's only a problem during visits, so we should just put up with it for a few days.\n\nA week ago we visited her. Later, I noticed that the smoke alarm looked different that all the other smoke alarms in the house. After looking a while, I suspected that it was a hidden camera, but I wasn't sure. I didn't want to accuse her, but I did want to push back, so I got out my laptop, stacked boxes underneath it, tilted it, found a specific type of porn on the internet, and left it playing in front of the smoke detector for a half-hour. I won't say what type of porn, but it's something that she really hates. That night, I also changed clothes in the bathroom.\n\nAround noon the next day, she stormed into the living room where my husband and I were watching TV, screaming at me for being \"gross\", \"disgusting\" and a \"porn addict\". I asked her how she knew that I played porn in her house, and she wouldn't admit anything. I then explained the spy camera to my husband, and he asked her if it was true. She denied the spy camera, but he could tell she was lying.\n\nShe was still angry and shrieking at me, and realized she wasn't getting her way, so she stomped out of the room, came back with my laptop, and threw it on the ground in front of us, breaking it. My husband said it was best if we both left to cool down. So we grabbed out bags, and checked into a hotel. Eventually, we left for home without seeing her again.\n\nMy husband was angry with me for playing the porn, and says that I should have just told him, or put tape over the hidden camera. He agrees that she was inappropriate, but he thinks I unnecessarily escalated the situation. And said that she's \"triggered\" by that type of porn.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
