Look when Tennants are destroying property and causing more damage and risk then the value of their rent it's time for them to leave. You gave them more then enough time and frankly it's no longer your problem\n\nThat being said, consult an attorney because you want to make sure you are following the proper process", "You've given them extra time already.  The legal requirement is 30 days; you've given them six weeks.  You've already been generous, particularly since he's been a rotten tenant.  If his political seat is more important than finding his family a place to live, that's his problem, not yours.  NTA.", "NTA.

You\u2019ve been more than accommodating, more than patient.", "NTA - you've given more than the normal notice for someone that frequently abused his access to your property, everything else is just fluff - I'd start the legal eviction process immediately so that you can be free of them asap.", "NTA you have gone about this professionally and gave him a move out date. I would go ahead and start in the paper work though cause this dude is probably dug in like a tick.", "I mean. NTA. But won\u2019t it just cost you money to go to court to formally evict them if they refuse to leave? Isn\u2019t there a risk they could fight the eviction in court and then drag this damn thing out even longer?  If he has a full time job, he might be able to afford an attorney and buy that time he needs anyway.", "You're following the legal requirements. NTA. Take note of EVERYTHING that is going on.\n\nIf he tries to retaliate, use that all to your advantage. And since he holds a political position, pass that onto the ethics board (if there is one). Let them know he is willfully violating legal documents among other things. This is a last resort move as it really is a dick move BUT it's also a case of if he's trying to go nuclear, take him out first.", "NTA. You're not his friend or his family. You're his landlord. He's caused what sounds like significant property damage, so you asked him to leave on 45 days notice. If he cared so much about his family he should have found them a place to stay in that really long notice period. It's not your fault he didn't take you seriously.", "NTA but you should probably get an attorney on speed with everything.

You\u2019ve given plenty of time for the notice.", "NTA - you already have extra time which was overly kind given the treatment of your property", "Tell him, \"Sure! For a daily rate, of course.\" Then, tell him that everything beyond the 1st is getting binned. If he won't pay, then anything there after the move-out date gets binned. You have been more than accommodating to people who have no respect for your time or property.", "NTA.  6 weeks is generous and he should have seen this coming for a long time.

Look up the rules for storing personal property after eviction in your state - whether you must store it or you just move it outside on the to a public area (the curb) for a few day to allow for pick up.
