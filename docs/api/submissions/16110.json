She is Korean and originally came to my current country as a student and I grew up in Korea but my family moved here when I was 15..\n\nWe met in school and both did similar degrees which shared a lot of courses. I decided to make a wedding invitation web site and put a lot of effort to make it special. I am a front end web dev these days so I wanted to make something nice. Since I was the one who proposed I wrote a small story about how we met and key events in our relationship and wanted to write it in a humorous way. This was for a Korean audience since most of our family is Korean and our wedding will be held in Korea, so the form of humor is a little self deprecating and the story talks about things that Korean elders value like education etc.\n\nA very small part of the story like less than 15% poked fun in a lighthearted way about how I stayed with her despite her bad driving and how I did not leave and was loyal even though she took longer to graduate due to withdrawing from courses and failing a some classes. I also wrote stuff about myself like how I liked her but it took me months to ask her out and how I had already prepared myself to cope for rejection and thought she was out of my league. Also how without her I would never be able to cook anything besides instant ramen etc.\n\nShe was supposed to see the website as a surprise and I sent out emails with the link and there was a copy of invitation cards and the story attached in the email.\n\nWhen my fiance saw it though she got upset and said I should not have put the part about her driving and taking longer to graduate. I thought it was not such a big deal, though I agreed to remove it from the website although the original version is already sent in the email. Her family obviously knows she took longer to graduate and she pokes fun about it herself sometimes, like how she feels lucky to get her current job despite that etc. She has not done badly at school overall or anything and it is not like she struggled to graduate, she was just one semester behind.\n\nHer parents agree with me and think she is over reacting and that it is not such a big deal and most of the family is on my side except for my sister and one of her sisters.\n\nAITA here? I really put in a lot of effort to write it and I felt it was really well done for a Korean audience and it is not like I wrote it exclusively to make fun of her.\n\nEDIT: Many people are saying she should have seen it first. She did not want to and wanted a surprise since I was the one who proposed it was meant to be a why I proposed and the story from my perspective type of thing.", "created_utc": 1682903443, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1348mkj/aita_for_making_a_wedding_invitation_website_for/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Self- deprecation is only applicable to the stuff you were talking about for yourself. You needed her consent for the stuff you added about her schooling and her driving, essentially looking at those things as her \"flaws\".\n\nThis shouldn't have been written for the audience at all. This should have been dedicated to your future wife. This is the invite to your wedding where you get to marry her. She shouldn't have to worry about how you talk about her to others, especially her friends and family.", "YTA\n\nYour cultural background is irrelevant.\n\nIn all cultures, if you do something that hurts the person you love, your romantic partner, and you choose not to apologize, and instead double down that their hurt \u2018is an over reaction\u2019 then you\u2019re the asshole.", "Something like this should be a group effort if it\u2019s going to friends and family. Also the whole \u2018it was a little joke, a bit of humour\u2019 makes me think you were way more rude to her than you said. YTA.", "YTA. Why would you send out a story highlighting that it took her longer to graduate? Particularly to an East Asian audience. Even in Western culture where education is taken less seriously, you'd be the ass. It feels like a weirdly strange power move, and contextualized yourself in your story as \"you still stayed with her\" despite it, I am fairly certain it was.", ">form of humor is a little self deprecating \n\nBut you didn't poke fun at yourself once. The entire story was pointing out all of HER short comings. Awful and cruel. YTA", "YTA. The driving is maybe not such a big deal but teasing her about taking longer to graduate is in poor taste for a few reasons. First, as you say, education is an important value in Korean culture, as opposed to driving or men's ability to cook, so it kind of called out the problem in front of everyone. Second it should have been clear that was a bigger insecurity for your fiancee since she says she feels lucky to have her job (that doesnt sound like a joke at all.) Third you really werent self deprecating about yourself in the same way; you picked out two very specific flaws, one of which is culturally important and clearly a sore subject for your fiancee, while at the same time picking something vague and hypothetical (your girlfriend being out of your league) or not as sensitive (your ability to cook). And of course since you picked what to include it was easy for you not to make big insecurities of yours front and center.", "Yeah, I think YTA. You could have still surprised her with the website before you sent it out by showing it to her when it was finished. Then you could have gotten her approval and asked her if she wanted any changes before you both sent it out together. The website is for the wedding of BOTH of you, not just you, and therefore, she should have had a say in its content, surprise or not.", "This is a close one for me but yes I think YTA. You should not surprise someone with a joke at their expense, at least not without recognizing you're taking a risk and may need to clean it up, and cleaning it up is easier in a live event or something reversible like a website. Since you mailed it, the damage is simply done. The offense is a small one, but an offense it is.\n\n~~And I believe you have compounded it by getting your respective families involved in the dispute. I do not believe you should have asked the family, at all, in a such a small thing. I believe you should simply have apologized and moved on.~~\n\nI would like you to consider that in most societies, Western and non-Western, power is unevenly divided, and young women have among the least social power within a family. If she does not like something, for whatever reason, she has little ability to say no to it without social disapproval. You may say it's about respect for elders, but that respect falls a different way on men than on women in most places, such that it is something risky for a man to place an expectation of respect for elders to a woman of the same generation. Especially a man who hasn't grown up in her same family. Because you haven't lived by the standards you're trying to set (I don't agree with you that shared national heritage is sufficient), and you're not familiar with her family's dynamics, you're probably not going to set the standard correctly.", "YTA. Not coming from a Korean viewpoint, but I think there is a time a place for humor and a wedding invitation isn't it. Will her 80 year old aunts understand you are being humorous or will they think you are being mean. Save the humor for speeches.", "Yta, why are you asking internet strangers if your fiance's feelings are valid? They are telling you that your actions hurt them, whether that was your intention or not you still caused harm.", "YTA\n\nYou poked fun at her expense and made it seem as though you're doing her the favour by just being with her. I'd be fuming", "YTA for what you wrote.  You mentioned that she withdrew from and failed some classes.  Based on how my Korean friends and students feel about education, this would be a source of shame and distress for her.  Her parents would also be upset.  Why bring something like that up for her to see again, her parents to see, her parents' friends and even strangers to see?  You're bringing back the embarrassment and stress of that time (especially if she did poorly due to depression or language problems) unnecessarily.  It's really nothing to joke about.  \n\nIf you want to make fun of someone, make fun of yourself. \n\nYou're justifying it by saying it was \"well done for a Korean audience,\" but **the most important audience is your fiancee**.  **If you love her, change it**, even if some people have already seen it.", "YTA. Why would you bring attention to things she's self conscious about? You could have surprised her with the rough draft, and she probably would have been delighted by the effort, and the ability to edit. You should have given her the right to rewrite.", "Slight YTA, I think regardless of you putting stuff there where you make fun of yourself to \u201cbalance\u201d it out you should\u2019ve made sure she was alright with you criticizing her driving and her taking longer to finish college. \n\nThose things are not really red flags, at least for me, in a relationship. \n\nThe fact people invited will read this would make the other person upset. \n\nAlso, need clarification on what you mean on Korean Audience. Is it that you can criticize your partner and not feel bad about it when people read it? I don\u2019t get it. \n\nMe being the father I would\u2019ve been on my daughter\u2019s side.", "YTA the parts that you say poke fun at you are general (she\u2019s out of my league, I was shy to ask her out). Literally any guy could say that. What you said about her was specific and personal. That\u2019s the difference. \n\n\nAlso bro don\u2019t side with her family that she\u2019s over reacting that\u2019s not the move.", "YTA. She should have been involved in what was sent out for everyone to see. I certainly would have vetoed that part, myself. It may appear to you that she was overreacting, but you embarrassed her and are now trying to dismiss her feelings. I would be mortified.", "YTA. You didnt think your life partner should see your wedding invitation website before you made it public? You dont think you should be making decisions together?", "I\u2019m making needlessly cruel \u201cjokes\u201d at my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s expense, AITA?", "YTA come on man.. that\u2019s embarrassing to her and you printed it for all to see. It doesn\u2019t matter what you or anyone else thinks. It was not kind of you to include that.", "Imagine someone took your insecurities and posted them for everyone to see. That would be humiliating. From your text it comes off as you posted bad things about her like bad drivning and taking a bit longer in school (but that you so graciously overlook) while your faults are not really faults at all, like being a bit shy about asking her out. Your family sucks a bit too about saying she is overreacting. This is supposedly the woman you love. You might want to start taking her feelings seriously. They should matter to you. \n\nYTA", "YTA, however unintentional it was. You exposed a weakness of hers that she didn't want public. \n\nYour lesson to learn is that if you don't want to make Jumeokbap of your balls, you will never say anything negative about her to the public again without first asking. \n\nYou owe her an apology, unless she wants to make  Gaebul from you. Lol.", "YTA. You can\u2019t cook? Not the same as rubbing it in someone\u2019s face that they failed and didn\u2019t graduate on time. Poking fun is \u2018she puts her shirts on the doorknobs, and I can burn water\u2019. That isn\u2019t anything major, it is something that is EASILY FIXABLE if it really is an issue. What you pointed out were flaws that she is insecure about because you think it\u2019s funny, that she can\u2019t fix. You were and AH and need to ask her how you can make this right for her.", "> how I did not leave and was loyal even though she took longer to graduate due to withdrawing from courses and failing a some classes.\n\nThis isn't self deprecating.  This is: 1) personal information and 2) just mean.  \n\nYou should have asked before sharing the info about her failing classes or withdrawing from courses.  \n\nYTA for not knowing how to self edit when sharing.", "YTA because of cultural and communication differences. \n\nI'm a Korean-American adoptee currently living in Korea so I can see the cultural differences coming into play as well as some communication issues.\n\nCultural: Korea is about saving face and humble bragging. Self-deprication is seen as tacky, rude, and an embarrassment to everyone. Please know your audience. This website link is shared far and wide. It lists her name and her image, right? Do you want her current/future employers to know she's a bad driver and fails classes? \n\nHow about her parents who never knew why she took an additional semester of classes? What if she was always upheld as the \"good girl\" in her family who all other cousins aspired to be and now she's a joke to them?\n\nThat stuff is public now. People probably took screenshots of it even if you deleted it. If she's trying to work her way up the corporate ladder, her colleagues who she's in competition with are probably gleefully gossiping about \"Miss I Can't Drive\". \n\nIt's \"bad enough\" that she's marrying a foreigner, but then to have that same foreigner air all her dirty laundry without her consent? That's what online bullies do. But you are her fiance. You are supposed to protect her image. But you literally just shattered all that she worked for, as well as her family. \n\nHer parents probably bragged to their friends about their daughter. Now their daughter is the laughing stock of the neighborhood. \n\nIn Korea, \"face\" is all you have and people try very hard to protect their own as well as others. I know as someone raised in America, this isn't as important. But her job and career could literally be at stake now. It also affected her family too, as they are seen as the parents of a \"failure\".\n\nCommunication: You probably should have included your fiance in the process of writing the biography for the website. It worries me. I'm an old married lady (together for 10 years, married for 7 years) but I'd never get on Facebook and tell the whole world about my husband's shortcomings.", "YTA, but not for making the site, but sending it out to people before she saw it", "YTA for needing to come here and ask us. \n\nShe has told you she doesn\u2019t like it. Change it.", "YTA there\u2019s a time for humour and this was not it. You were meant to be talking about how much you love her and why you want to spend the rest of your life with her, not saying that you\u2019d deign to marry her even though she sucked at x, y and z. No wonder she was mad, you\u2019ve made it sound like you\u2019re some long suffering guy who has to put up with all these faults but you\u2019re great enough to do it anyway because she cooks for you", "If I were in her shoes, my feelings would be hurt. It\u2019s a little belittling. I\u2019d want to be with someone who makes me feel confident and safe, someone who builds me up. Not someone who says \u201cdon\u2019t worry honey, I love you despite the fact that I\u2019m better than you at some things\u201d. It\u2019s cool that you can love her  imperfections, but why brag about it? It doesn\u2019t make either of you look good.", "Why would literally anyone's opinion about it matter other than hers? She told you how she feels, and you should care about that. Do you?", "YTA. Self depreciation is only when you talk trash about yourself. No matter how many hours you out in the website and story, no matter how many people love it, if your Fiancee doesn't like it, it's not ok.", "YTA, gently - it\u2019s both of your wedding, she should have had input on the website too.

Perhaps they are dissimilar to yours or someone else's:\n\nSelf-deprication: to demean yourself for humor or entertainment. For example, \"it took me three tries to pass the driving course\" and then we all chuckle at my expense. Maybe other people jump in with their numbers that are increasingly higher. Then we jokingly start a \"Failed Drivers Test\" group and call ourselves the \"FDT\"s for short as an inside joke. Maybe we get matching jerseys with our fake logo on it of a steering wheel with an X through it or something. And our number on our jersey is how many times we failed. To me, it's supposed to help you relate and connect better to others. \n\nHumble bragging: to get away with \"besting\" someone else by making the great thing I did sound as if it was a \"chore\" or difficult to do. For example, \"I just gave a twenty dollar bill for groceries to the homeless guy on the corner hashtag so blessed (with prayer hands emoji)\" or \"ugh! My husband MADE me choose between a BMW or a Mercedes. He's so mean (insert pouty emoji)!\" This is when I want to brag about being rich but make it sound like \"such a chore\". Or I want to brag about being spoiled by my husband but make it sound \"like a bad thing\". \"Woe is me! I have tens of thousands of dollars to throw away!\"\n\nSo I guess if you look at it like a Venn Diagram, they do have overlapping of sarcasm and putting yourself down but \"humble bragging\" has the \"bragging\" aspect of \"oh, you poor soul!

Given the importance placed on education in Korean culture, I imagine your fianc\u00e9e was mortified by struggling with some of her classes and needing to take an extra semester to graduate.

That might not have been what you intended, but it's definitely how it came across. \n\nMost people have topics that they're extra sensitive about, often because they're the subjects of family jibes. It's totally different to bring them up yourself than for someone who supposedly loves you to bring them up for other people's amusement.

But I *hate* when my sister brings them up in conversation, because it feels like she's enjoying pointing out my flaws and weaknesses.
