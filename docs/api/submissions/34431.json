Mom should be grateful you prevented that", "NTA! I have a 2 year old and ALWAYS listen to instructions for our safety! I don\u2019t let him do as he pleases, we are learning boundaries", "NTA that mother sure sounds entitled though.", "NTA. OMG my grandpa owns horses and I remember being a young tyke and walking around, I stood behind a horse. I wanted to play with her tail. My aunt, dad and grandpa all very calmly but firmly told me to NOT be behind the horse. I quickly moved out of the way. I now know that they will kick you and it can be fatal. You never approach a horse from behind or stand behind them, and you never run up on them. It\u2019s kind of a like a very large dog. Approach calmly from the front, let them see you, let them smell you, then and only then may you calmly pet them. They\u2019re very skittish and capable of putting a grown man into the ground. The mom is negligent and raising one brat of a daughter. You\u2019re NTA and you said what you said for a reason. You tried to keep them safe and they acted like entitled brats. Good on you for holding your ground, they\u2019re lucky the horse nipped and didn\u2019t actually bite or kick. Horses are incredibly powerful animals who will attack when threatened.

They disregarded that and were met with the natural consequence of that choice.", "NTA\n\nSome people need a horse to kick them in the head so they find out the hard way you don\u2019t mess with horses.", "N.T.A she should have listen to your instructions......when working with the horse you were in charge of the horse for safety reason not the mother or the kid you gave a clear instruction and she failed to comply,  she should have walked away till later...", "NTA - Mom is ignorant of how dangerous a horse can be be to a child - even without being unruly.   A nip is how a horse warns you that it is uncomfortable.   If disregarded, the next step can be even more dangerous.   \n\nIt will be interesting to hear what the people to whom she complained have to say.   My guess is that, other than including the word 'fuck', they will be fully supportive.  \n\nUnfortunately many people are unaware of real life dangers because they've been desensitized by television.   \n\nYou're NTA but mom is ( or she's just ignorant). \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWorked with horses a lot & with people who don't know anything about them.

You told the kid no. Kid did it anyways. Not listening to instructions can have consequences.", "NTA teaching your child not to approach animals thay can kill you is parenting basics.", "NTA. Some parents can be so clueless about animals", "NTA.\n\nYou literally said no, they couldn\u2019t say hi to the horse yet and warned them.

And she\u2019s pretty fucking dumb apparently.", "NTA, and neither is the little girl. It's so important to reach respect for animals, and that includes getting consent from their human companion before interacting with them! In this case, it was also a safety issue, you really had no choice but to step in since the mom wasn't.", "NTA, your priority was the safety of the kid and respecting the rules.
