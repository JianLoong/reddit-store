I live at home while I save up for my own place, and i help out with chores and babysitting. My brother, lets call him Eric, and I also didn't grow up together. He lived with our horrible mother, while I lived with my dad. We finally reunited a few years back, and I was over the moon. This was a new hope for me to have that brotherly bond we missed out on. For a while, things were OK. My dad let Eric move in with us, rent free, since he was barely scraping by. We've always cared for him so it was a no-brainer.\nMy stepmom as well has wanted a baby of her own a forever, but struggled with pregnancy. About a year after my brother moved in with us, there was a new baby in the house. It's been difficult. Baby brother (let's call him shaun) is about 3 and his sleep schedule is crazy.\n\nmain point:\nEric has lived with us just fine, and is even attending community college. We help pay for his tuition, and he used to help by getting groceries and helping around the house. All of this changed once Shaun was able to walk and started talking at about a 18 months. Eric started going to his room all the time, making snippy comments, and actively avoiding any sort of cleaning. Basically, If he's not at school or eating, he's in his room. It's gotten worse since he's picked up online gaming. He also gets money every month to try to help with things he wants/needs. He's been blowing it all, then coming to us for more.\n\nI could ignore a lot of it, but he has actively started talking shit about the family to me and doing things we've asked him multiple times NOT TO DO. For instance, he ignores my stepmom and I, who spend all day wrangling the toddler, when we ask him to quiet down when Shaun finally lays down for a nap. The number of times I've had to comfort a crying toddler woken up by literal screaming is fucking insane.\n\nIf we say anything, he has a full blown panic attack. Tonight was the last straw. After making snide comments about dinner, he goes to bed. My stepmom and I are left with Shaun,  trying to keep him occupied until hes finally tired. We find a funny cat video for him and he absolutely loves it, squealing and giggling. So Eric rather than a) texting one of the adults, b) getting up and asking us to tone it down (like we do with him), or c) just wearing the earplugs HE OWNS, this grown man bangs on the wall and shouts \"shut it!!\"\n\nMy stepmom and I had had enough. He doesn't help out, he wakes the kid up from her naps, and now he's going to act like a child when HE can't get sleep? So, we ignored it and let Shaun watch the video until he was done with it (about 20 minutes tops, he has a short attention span). Shaun wasn't in bed until 2:30 a.m. because Eric couldn't shut up for two minutes. I'm so fucking exhausted.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit for clarification:\nStepmom is NOT the one who abused my brother. That was our biological mother, who does not live in the household.\n\nWe are both over the age of 20, he is older than I am. I finished college and I'm working on getting a job. He didn't start school until he moved in, so this is understandable.\n\nI really appreciate all the helpful comments giving me more perspective from what Eric might be feeling, and how to handle it.

I can't tell because you write as if you guys are doing this huge favor for him like letting him stay rent free when you also stay there rent free. \"We've always cared for him\" is just a weird thing to say about a son/brother.

Why are you parenting a toddler that's essentially your half sib.", "After reading through your responses with the extra information, I can safely say you\u2019re NTA.\n\nEric probably feels out of place in the home. He\u2019s not your dad\u2019s biological son, nor your stepmom\u2019s and there is a new baby in the dynamic. He\u2019s the oddman out. I\u2019m just spitballing heree but it seems he still needs the family, needs the support, but likely feels he should move on, but can\u2019t,  so this causes him to become angry. Obviously a more healthy expression of his feelings would better for the family, he\u2019s likely doesn\u2019t feel capable of doing that without feeling \u201cweak\u201d, so he acts out. \n\nI think a good brother/sister talk may help, or maybe he\u2019s just a prick, that\u2019s always a possibility.", "NTA. I feel sorry for everyone in this story, though. You're taking on parental responsibilities, your poor stepmom has to navigate a volatile young adult while she raises her baby, the poor baby is dealing with that negative, angry adult in his world, and Eric obviously feels disproportionate resentment/jealousy for the (loved and wanted) biological child of your father, and is also showing signs of significant depression. Everyone is stressed and reacting in their own way to this sad dynamic. You don't talk about your dad much here, except to say he's stepped up in a good way--caring for and helping Eric out, But you say your biological mom was awful--what kind of abuse or neglect did Eric experience?I know everyone's stretched thin, but is there a way to encourage him to get some help/therapy to understand why he's feeling the way he does? He needs to hear how unacceptable his behavior is, but he needs to hear it with compassion. If you can't swing a therapist, this conversation should be with your dad.", "NTA.", "NTA sorry your brother seems awful to live with, I think it\u2019s time to talk to your dad, if he makes everybody miserable in the house a loooong talk is overdue.

However, both of my kids developed a rather normal sleep schedule by about two months old.  That doesn't mean they would sleep all night.  Just that they were generally asleep by 8PM or so, and would mostly sleep through the night.  To me, it sounds odd that a toddler would regularly be up at \\~2AM, in the sense that the child hasn't slept at all yet.  Maybe this is a job for that nanny on the TV reality show?", "NTA.

But creating a hostile environment because the home he lives in (for free) doesn't tick his standards because of a toddler isn't okay.

I really wish the limit wasn't so small on posts. Dad mostly does cleaning or cooking when he can, and watches the kiddo when he's home so my stepmom and I can kind of get a break, but Shaun's really attached to my stepmom and will usually go for her (or sometimes me) over my dad.

I'll certainly keep that in mind if/when we all sit down and talk.", "A lot of that is what I had to cut due to word limits, but you're hitting the nail on the head. Eric's been through a lot, which is mostly why I posted this. Our mother was abusive, even to my dad before they split. There's a lot of stuff going on with Eric, but unfortunately he won't seek help, even when we offer to help him find a therapist. He won't really talk to my dad about personal feelings, and a lot has to do with our mother.\n\nHe mostly vents to me about his feelings, and while I do want to help, I really can't be his therapist.

It does sound like a parenting issue.", "Think of it from Eric's pov though. He was abused and neglected by the same mother who now wants him to babysit her new baby. How would he feel? How would you feel?\nAll that trauma, PTSD, memories.\n\nHe sought refuge in this man's house where he worked chores around the house in return for someone raking care of him while he was still underaged and pay for college (which he needs to survive) and food/shelter/etc\n\nHe didn't get those for free. He worked for it as well in whatever capacity he could've as a child back then. \n\nNow the same mother and child is in the safe place he sought refuge in to accept them and demands to be taken care and provided services for? \n\nHow would you in his shoes react?", "No it's not Eric's responsibility to pick up the slack for his mother who abused him throughout the years he, as a child, lived with her", "It kinda sounds like you think he's a guest and not really part of the family", "You should add that to your post. That he's not your dad's child. It makes things make a lot more sense, IMO.", "Then I wouldn't start with a \"hard talk.\" I'd (and again, this should be your dad talking, not you!) step back and start with a gentle talk.

What's going on with you? Can you tell me why you're feeling the way you do?\" Then close with \"I love you and want this to work for everyone. I also want everyone in our home to feel safe and wanted. Here's what I need from you to make that happen.\" with a clear, specific, non-emotional outline of expectations. (\"No more yelling and thumping on the wall when you're angry\" instead of \"You can't scream and lose your shit and upset everyone in the house like this\")  \nEDIT: If you feel like your dad can't have this conversation with him, and you want to have it instead, my advice is to start the same way, but change the last part from a request FOR him to problem-solving WITH him. You're his peer, not the head of household, and coming from a place of inside authority could trigger the \"outside-ness\" he feels that's at the root of his trauma. So, something like \"I know we both want everyone in this house to feel safe and good. How can I help you feel more that way?\" And then ask for what you need from him in return.", "I don't think that's Eric's mother, though.", "He is living with her for free. That entails SOME consideration for his \"housemates\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he was abused that badly, he should escape and move out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: It certainly is NOT his sister's responsibility to cater to her brother.", "I didn't mean for it to sound like that but I could see how it could look like that.

Thanks for the different viewpoint, it really helps me kind of think things through", "I appreciate the advice, It hadn't even crossed my mind that it might get misconstrued.", "Oh wow this is really helpful, honestly I'm not sure how to say thanks for this, because this could seriously help with a lot of stress in the household. (I hope that doesn't come off as sarcasm, I am going to try and use this advice)", "Don't know but OP said, if I recall correctly, in the post as well as in some replies that the mother was abusive to Eric since the dad didn't want his custody so he had to live with her for years as a child.", "Don't know. If I erred in understanding then I apologise to OP. But still he might be having massive flashbacks to the time he was abused and unwanted and neglected when he sees how loved and cared for the baby brother is.", "[deleted]", "Sounds like Eric is insecure about his place in the family. He's living with a guy who isn't technically his Dad, hasn't adopted him, maybe who didn't fight for custody of him during the divorce. Then he has a biological son, Eric feels replaced/insecure about his place in the family. So he bullies Shaun. \n\nRealistically Eric is an adult. If Eric isn't able to admit his feelings and find a healthy outlet for them, your Dad and StepMum will have no choice but to ask them to leave. And Eric will have created a self-fulfilling prophecy. He will take being asked to leave as evidence that Shaun replaced him, he has no family, no one loves him, has been rejected from everywhere etc. \n\nAnd truthfully it's easy to give grace when this behaviour comes from a troubled teenage child. If Eric is old enough to attend college, than he's too old to be coping with his trauma the same way 15 yr olds do.", "THe \"son\" is an adult who moved back in and refuses to get a job.", "I wonder how nobody here says Eric needs to move out (and probably OP too). NTA, but everybody else sucks (except the toddler) - a dad who did a charitable thing without taking any responsibility for it (he invited Eric to live there and doesn't do anything to help him feel at home, or at least there is nothing in the post); a mom who still cannot handle her child after 3 years; a grown-ass Eric who is trying to compete with a toddler instead of learning to be an adult. It seems like OP tried to fill in all the gaps left gaping by the family, and to play all the roles at the same time, which is (1) impossible, (2) further disrupts the dynamics. Eric needs to live on his own (you can still help paying for his education - I don't mean cutting him off fully, but he needs a living situation where he finally grows up). OP, if they are over 18,also needs to move out, leaving actual parents to figure out the parenting. It looks like the whole family would benefit from some distance. Including toddler whose schedule might improve without a constant annoying factor.", "I just finished college and I'm currently job seeking but I guess you're kind of right.

Basically, I just finished school before he did.", "I think you got a bit confused on a few details. No one in this household has abused him. That was our bio mother, who he moved away from after he turned 18. He didn't move in until after he was 20.", "Actually, he's a few years older than I am. We're both adults, just allowed to stay at my dad's house.", "Then he needs to work on his mental health- having trauma isn\u2019t his fault but not treating it and letting it rule his life is. Your parents should sit him down (without you) and let him know that if he doesn\u2019t start going to treatment then he will need to leave. He can abuse others because of his untreated mental health", "Actually, my bio mom was abusive. My stepmom has never been, and that's who's toddler this is. My dad did want custody but was unable to obtain it. I think you got a bit confused.", "I think that may be what happens, but we don't treat him any differently. I suppose it makes sense that he's struggling personally. I'll keep that in mind going forwards.", "My dad did try for custody, but I can understand Eric thinking otherwise. Our mother was very manipulative and made my dad out to be the bad guy most of their life."]}
