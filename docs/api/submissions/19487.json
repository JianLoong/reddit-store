YTA", "I'm go with ESH since it was your son's first day with you. Under the majority of circumstances, requiring everybody participate in something is a reasonable condition of him extending free room and board to everybody.

For most Saturdays in the future if this is a rent-free arrangement, I would say YTA. Since you had just gotten your son from your ex, him unpacking should have counted as \"cleaning.\" It didn't make sense for him to want your son vacuuming or whatever when he had unpacked bags and was settling in to a new environment. His participation could also have been made really easy, like just cleaning the room he was going to be staying in while everybody else worried about the rest of the house.\n\nStill, this should have been a one-time exception for his first day. Saturday is coming up again in seven days, so you should have another opportunity not to be an AH. Your wife's dad sounds like he might be neurodiverse, given the way he dug his heels in over a rule he made up.

Helping out with dishes etc would seem more appropriate to me.", "YTA.", "NTA\n  It was your first custody day since you moved in.   It was a power move, and you set your boundary.

Does this mean that you clean to a certain level, and then quit? If so, your son is old enough to help, and should do so.\n\nHowever, if the standard is to clean all day long, regardless as to what state the house is in, then asking you and your son to give up half of your time together just to satisfy your FiL's OCD, that's another matter.", "NTA. He literally just walked in the house, give the kid a break. It always bothers me that people who insist on cleaning all the time act like it has to be done immediately right when they want to do it.

He once cleaned only his dishes when they were in the sink that had other dirty dishes in it. This dude cannot do anything unprompted if it doesn't directly benefit him.\n\nAnd guess what? He sucks as a roommate. Everyone who's ever lived with him agrees. The attitude of \"I didn't make the mess so I don't have to clean it\" is not the way to raise your kids.", "NTA. The kid doesn\u2019t live there all week why should he have to spend the day cleaning instead of enjoying time with his dad.", "One of the things I learned from my parents early is when I'm a guest at someone else's house, always offer to help out.  If they're happened to be doing something that I could help with, offer to lend a hand. Also clean up after myself.  And always help out (or ask to help out) with setting the table and clearing the table, etc.\n\nJust a nice thing to do. \n\nNo judgment.  \n\nIt's your life and your kid.  Do whatever you want.

A place he never set foot in until the night before? He's NINE. He doesn't even know the lay of the land yet.\n\nIt's perfectly fine to ask OP's son to unpack and tidy his area.

Use that time to decide on some age-appropriate chores.", "I feel like ESH isn\u2019t exactly the right vote, but I also don\u2019t really know what else to say. I feel like this could\u2019ve been solved with communicating and compromising. \n\nI think it\u2019s weird to insist the 9 year old immediately hop to cleaning the first day he gets there. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for FIL to want everyone to participate in Saturday cleaning. \n\nCould there have been a conversation where maybe you say \u201chey FIL, my child needs a day to settle in, unpack, and get used to this new living situation. Can we let him help with dishes after dinner or set aside a chore or two for him to do tomorrow? He can fully participate next Saturday.\u201d \n\nJust seems like no one was willing to compromise at all, and in this situation I think there was a lot of room for compromise.", "YTA. \u201cHe is a very fastidious person which I respect.\u201d Evidently, you do not respect him or his wishes for how to manage his own home while you and your family burden him by staying at his house.

I would bet that you contribute very little in your own home either. \n\nNot only should you not prevent your son from helping, you should be right at his side participating in the cleanup without being asked!\n\nYour FIL should boot your disrespectful ass out the door.

Step in line sparky.", "YTA here, OP. \n\nFor whatever reason, you are unable to provide a home of your own for your wife and son.

Definitely think in the future he should participate as the upkeep will be in the place he is living- but he hasn\u2019t been living there and I don\u2019t think this teaches the son anything on his first day in a house except to dislike his grandfather who didn\u2019t even allow him any time or space to adjust before cleaning things he\u2019s never seen before. Never moved into an apartment and immediately had to clean up for the people who left, never stayed with a friend on a trip and immediately cleaned upon arrival.

For my child, no.", "I bet the kids love you.", "Did you clean a mess in another house that you didn't make?\n\nLike, go see grandma for the weekend and cleaning for the whole day on Saturday, a mess that your grandma made.dueong the week?", "This is my thought. I didn't know how to clean really well until way into adulthood. \n\nTeach your kid lessons, OP, and don't make and of them entitlement.", "Except his son has not created any of the mess so not the same situation at all. There\u2019s a major difference between teaching a child to clean up after themselves vs expecting them to clean up after you. OP can give his son the opportunity next Saturday after his son has actually contributed to the mess.", "A 9 yo however can have some shared responsibility for chores in the home.", "> He\u2019s 9, if he doesn\u2019t already have some sort of responsibilities, he definitely needs some.\n\nThat's for his parents to decide. Like I said, as long as the parents do enough to cover his share, it's none of FIL's business.", "This seems completely fair to me. I'm all for kids tidying up their messes, already training my toddler to do so, but it seems really unfair to expect him to clean a mess he had no part in making and wasn't even in the house for. I don't understand all the y t a votes.", "INFO: How often does the custody change? If its weekly, will your son never have to contribute to the cleanliness of the house in which he spends half his time?", "I completely understand this (assuming in the future he will also participate in cleaning after having been there a while). NTA", "So you want him to be able to use stuff around the house, but not participate in keeping it clean and organized, YTA.\n\nAlso, this seems like the stupidest hill to die on.", "He really couldn't put his stuff away and then wipe down a counter? Or sweep the floor? \n\nIn the end, it is your FIL's home. He is providing a roof over your head and your son's head.", "Please tell me you can move out. I do not agree that your FIL should include a child who is only there every other weekend for the cleanings but it is his house. No judgment because given the same circumstances I would move out if possible, even if it was a room.", "So what's your plan for when he kicks you out?\n\nYou got options?", "In the sense that a person living alone has control of their environment... And with  three additional people there is additional stuff, noise, commotion which the FIL has to adapt to. Lessening the disruption is the least the three additional people can do", "Eh, it\u2019s basic shorthand for reality. I hear you though. In this case though, you are correct that there can be nuances.  Weirdly, in my read of situation, grandfather was treating the child as part of what family does (even though doesn\u2019t sound like child technically family), that felt right to me.  Dad separated and othered the child. Felt wrong. Also, as wife father, he can set rules for his daughter to have \u2018guests\u2019 if you will, even under your thinking. Just feels like a dumb hill for OP to die on\u2026I\u2019m guessing his ego is bruised that they have to live with FIL & saw this as a way to exert some authority.", "Have you had a whole family move into the house you own? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable at all. It\u2019s not a power trip, it\u2019s trying to keep chaos from happening when a family moves into your home.", "Power trip on OPs part. You don\u2019t move into someone\u2019s home knowing the rules and then say those rules don\u2019t apply to my son.", "As with any rule, it can be abused. Of course. It wasn\u2019t here. The exception to the rule does not in most cases mean the reality isn\u2019t correct.", "Are you going to have him clean next Saturday?", "So I\u2019m assuming that mentality is going to go both ways?\n\nWhen your wife cooks - for her children, yes. For your child, no\n\nOr when she buys things -for her children, yes. For your child, no.\n\nAnd when the kids are sick - care for her kids but not for your child.\n\nIs that how you expect things to be?", "Saying your wife has no say over YOUR child makes you the biggest AH, your a family unit now and your causing a divide. you should be partners in everything! that's including raising all children, one child should not be singled out just because he's not your wife's and you feel guilty because you don't see him as often. you'll end up causing bigger problems with your other children down the line who thinks your playing favorites.", "Meh.

He has myself and his mother to provide for him financially. Usually my wife and I alternate cooking. Obviously, we are cooking for everyone present whenever we cook. I would not expect her to care for my son when he is sick and risk her own health. That is my responsibility.", "She doesn't get a say though. Neither does my ex's fiance. The only people who get a say are his parents.", "Homeowners do not get to overrule the guests on how to parent their own kids.", "As far as I can tell the parents are still trying to be parents. It's FIL who is trying to take over and making himself a glorified babysitter when he has no business telling a child who isn't his what to do. FIL has no blood relation to the 9yo, yet feels entitled to tell that child's actual father that he is in control of both of them? A house is not more important than an actual person. FIL is disrespecting the father's job of being a father by trying to take control over something he has no business sticking his nose into. FIL can either agree to let the kid stay, or not, but he has no right to overrule the actual father's parenting. FIL has not been given the role of babysitter by the father, so he needs to stop acting entitled to the 9yo and that child's labor.", "Just measure dicks already. Jesus. Respect your wife enough to respect her family. YTA.", "This is power move I firmly dislike.  If you want to leave leave,  but don\u2019t burn down the relationship and wait to be \u201casked to leave\u201d so that you can play martyr.

Why put your son in this hostile/awkward environment?", "She's his step parent, do you think that means nothing? Especially considering you have other children together, is this a ' I don't want your partner parenting my child so mine won't either' scenario? You need to have a look at your situation as a whole because your causing a major divide in your family and don't even seem to realize it. If your wifes caring for your child she has every right to be a parental figure that includes making choices and inputs and if you want to say she doesn't care for him I do, then again you need to actually look at your \"family\" because that's not how real life works.", "Genuinely curious, what does this mean? How can a child live with you, your wife, and your wife has no say in his upbringing? That seems like it would cause a lot of unnecessary confusion and drama for all involved.", "I'm not going to storm off after a single disagreement. I know he wants to spend time with his grandkids. I'd like to resolve the situation amicably if possible.", "Only myself and his mother get a say in his upbringing.", "I haven\u2019t heard you offer a compromising solution.  You seem rooted to your stance.  What is your \u201camicable resolve\u201d?", "If we are able to move past this and get along I will stay the last three weeks. If not, I will rent a vacation villa for three weeks. I know that would upset him a lot, but if he's going to be unhappy regardless, there'd be no point in considering his feelings. Hopefully, it doesn't come to that."]}
