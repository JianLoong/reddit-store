YTA", "I'm go with ESH since it was your son's first day with you. Under the majority of circumstances, requiring everybody participate in something is a reasonable condition of him extending free room and board to everybody.

For most Saturdays in the future if this is a rent-free arrangement, I would say YTA. Since you had just gotten your son from your ex, him unpacking should have counted as \"cleaning.\" It didn't make sense for him to want your son vacuuming or whatever when he had unpacked bags and was settling in to a new environment. His participation could also have been made really easy, like just cleaning the room he was going to be staying in while everybody else worried about the rest of the house.\n\nStill, this should have been a one-time exception for his first day. Saturday is coming up again in seven days, so you should have another opportunity not to be an AH. Your wife's dad sounds like he might be neurodiverse, given the way he dug his heels in over a rule he made up.

Helping out with dishes etc would seem more appropriate to me.", "YTA.", "NTA\n  It was your first custody day since you moved in.   It was a power move, and you set your boundary.

Does this mean that you clean to a certain level, and then quit? If so, your son is old enough to help, and should do so.\n\nHowever, if the standard is to clean all day long, regardless as to what state the house is in, then asking you and your son to give up half of your time together just to satisfy your FiL's OCD, that's another matter.", "NTA. He literally just walked in the house, give the kid a break. It always bothers me that people who insist on cleaning all the time act like it has to be done immediately right when they want to do it.

He once cleaned only his dishes when they were in the sink that had other dirty dishes in it. This dude cannot do anything unprompted if it doesn't directly benefit him.\n\nAnd guess what? He sucks as a roommate. Everyone who's ever lived with him agrees. The attitude of \"I didn't make the mess so I don't have to clean it\" is not the way to raise your kids.", "NTA. The kid doesn\u2019t live there all week why should he have to spend the day cleaning instead of enjoying time with his dad.", "One of the things I learned from my parents early is when I'm a guest at someone else's house, always offer to help out.  If they're happened to be doing something that I could help with, offer to lend a hand. Also clean up after myself.  And always help out (or ask to help out) with setting the table and clearing the table, etc.\n\nJust a nice thing to do. \n\nNo judgment.  \n\nIt's your life and your kid.  Do whatever you want.

A place he never set foot in until the night before? He's NINE. He doesn't even know the lay of the land yet.\n\nIt's perfectly fine to ask OP's son to unpack and tidy his area. If OP's son asks to help, let him help. Otherwise, at least give the poor kid a few days before tossing whole-house cleaning at him. Use that time to decide on some age-appropriate chores.", "I feel like ESH isn\u2019t exactly the right vote, but I also don\u2019t really know what else to say. I feel like this could\u2019ve been solved with communicating and compromising. \n\nI think it\u2019s weird to insist the 9 year old immediately hop to cleaning the first day he gets there. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for FIL to want everyone to participate in Saturday cleaning. \n\nCould there have been a conversation where maybe you say \u201chey FIL, my child needs a day to settle in, unpack, and get used to this new living situation. Can we let him help with dishes after dinner or set aside a chore or two for him to do tomorrow? He can fully participate next Saturday.\u201d \n\nJust seems like no one was willing to compromise at all, and in this situation I think there was a lot of room for compromise.", "YTA. \u201cHe is a very fastidious person which I respect.\u201d Evidently, you do not respect him or his wishes for how to manage his own home while you and your family burden him by staying at his house.

I would bet that you contribute very little in your own home either. \n\nNot only should you not prevent your son from helping, you should be right at his side participating in the cleanup without being asked!\n\nYour FIL should boot your disrespectful ass out the door.

Step in line sparky.", "YTA here, OP. \n\nFor whatever reason, you are unable to provide a home of your own for your wife and son.

Definitely think in the future he should participate as the upkeep will be in the place he is living- but he hasn\u2019t been living there and I don\u2019t think this teaches the son anything on his first day in a house except to dislike his grandfather who didn\u2019t even allow him any time or space to adjust before cleaning things he\u2019s never seen before. Never moved into an apartment and immediately had to clean up for the people who left, never stayed with a friend on a trip and immediately cleaned upon arrival.

Why are you leaving there anyway", "This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think ESH.\n\nFirst off, I agree that it's a bit much to expect a child to immediately participate in a house cleaning ritual the *moment* he moves in (or, at least, this is how your description of events makes it come across). Let the kid unpack, breathe, nibble a snack, and have a few minutes to learn what the new rules are in this new environment.\n\nAt the same time....\n\nYou're well-aware that your FIL expects *everyone* who resides in the house to participate in cleaning it every Saturday. I assume this is regardless of *who* made the most mess out of all of you adults living there. Even if *you* didn't make a mess, it sounds like you would still be expected to help out with keeping the house clean. So, I don't agree that this logic *shouldn't* be extended to your child at all because he \"hadn't participated in creating any mess.\" He is undoubtedly going to contribute to dirtying the house the very second he steps inside. Because we're humans. Humans are pretty dirty with the way we track in mud, dirt, germs, dirty dishes, create dust, etc. Children are *especially* gifted at creating messes, seen and unseen.\n\nI agree your FIL shouldn't try to make decisions for your child. You're the parent here. But at the same time, you're living in *his* house and had already agreed to abide by the rules of cleaning every Saturday. *You* made the decision to bring your son into the house knowing this rule. This is pretty much a familial house share situation, and I don't quite understand *why* it's such a big deal for your son to help clean in *any* capacity. Instead of talking it, you walked all over his rule and just said \"no.\" And \"no.\" and \"no.\" \n\nI encourage the three of you to sit down and have an ADULT conversation about where the rules can bend vs. where they can't.

Yes, if I leave the kids are coming with me.", "Yeah eventually I would say if there isn't a solution then moving out is what needs to happen\n\nBut you absolutely can still have values you live by even while taking hand outs\n\nSomeone helping you doesn't mean they then get to dictate how you raise your kid\nThey are well within their rights to take away that help for whatever reason they want \n\nBut you can't just make demands of someone just because you helped them, they are still an adult, with a full set of individuals rights, no amount of hand outs stop you being an adult who can make decisions for themselves", "People just can\u2019t move past a literalist\u2019s application of \u201cmy house my rules\u201d.\n\nNot only is \u201cmy house my rules\u201d a lazy parenting cliche (try teaching them *why* you insist on things instead of just demanding compliance), trying to enforce it against a grown adult is weird AF. Trying to enforce rules on someone else\u2019s kid is also weird AF.", "Agreed, cleaning up a bit on a Saturday isn't going to hurt anyone. I mean yeah, he might miss out on some dad time, but if dad is going to be cleaning anyway that time wasn't going to be there. The kid's father has missed an opportunity to teach his son they can work together to clean a bit and have some fun talking and enjoying the cooperative spirit of completing a task. Instead he's turned it into a match of wills in another man's home where he is a guest. It's his father-in-law's house it's his rules. He is teaching the son that rules shouldn't apply to him because he's new which isn't how life works. Rules apply equally whether new or old. \n\nOP - YTA if you don't like how father-in-law's rules work, pack your things and get out of the man's house.", "My apologies if I'm wrong here but it sounds like you were being used to do regular chores that were likely getting pushed back until your arrival, especially if it took hours. Being made to clean up all of the mess of a family is incredibly frustrating, especially as a kid who wouldn't have contributed to it. Children should not be considered free labor at any point in their life by anyone, and if a kid is doing chores it should be their choice to do so, but people need to know how to clean things and how to be responsible and those are much easier lessons to learn as a kid.\nOP said FIL is very fastidious, so I'm assuming the Saturday cleaning is likely just sweeping/vacuuming, laundry, any necessary dusting. Fastidious people don't usually put off doing all the dishes and picking up because it's way easier to keep a place clean if you're constantly cleaning.", "So you're saying the kid should burn down the house?", "Except you aren't providing for him. The roof that is currently overtop of his head is thanks to the largesse of your father in law who you just gave a middle finger to. If you were providing for him, it wouldn't be an issue. If you don't want him to participate in household tasks then he should stay with his mother until you can provide for him properly. Yta", "Your wife agreed to let the other kids leave with you?", "Then the dad should cover the child's part of the cleaning, as well as his own. \n\nHe can't just say 'this goes against my values' and be done with it.", "He said FIL cleans on Saturday; the kid arrived on Friday. The kid will also be there assuming the 3 days (fss) Thats 3 out of 7 for the week and probably be at moms the following weekend. So, Yeah he should clean his share too. Cleaning is not free labor; you take care of the environment you are in.", "Amen. These are sick people that think kids exist to serve. If the FIL was a decent human maybe he'd even cut OP some slack and say hey maybe do a little less today and spend some time with the kid. Or hey, I don't know, since we're all a family maybe we'll clean tomorrow or another day and go spend some time together today?", "The kid arrived Friday. He had time to unpack and settle. Being asked to help clean a few things when someone is letting you (and your child) live in their home isn't a big deal. The FIL wasn't expecting the kid to turn into cinderella.", "Read the post. It was the next day\u2026", "My older brother used to arrive home from school 10 minutes later than I did. I would have walked, in pretty hot  summers and quite cold winters, and he drove. So he would come home reasonably refreshed and abuse me for relaxing with dad instead of cleaning the house. That's right he expected me to come home from school and immediately start cleaning. He would then yell at me some more to help him. I of course refused and he was too stupid to ever try a different approach so he yelled at me and cleaned by himself every time. I still have issues about cleaning. \n\nAnd he still talks down to me about everything. He can't see anything from anyone else's point of view. Rather like OP's FIL.", "I had to wash dishes for my family of nine. But so did my brothers. We had chore charts where you did one chore every day, like wash the dishes or set the table, and swapped that chore out weekly. And another chart where you had a chore that you did once a week, like vacuum the living room or clean a bathroom, and we swapped those around every month.\n\nEven my misogynist dad realized that with one daughter and six sons, all the chores could not fall on my shoulders.", "Did they have other chores?", "This whole scenario is wild. I really feel for the 9 yr old. This doesn\u2019t sound like a cohesive or healthy family situation at all.", "He would if the FIL would compromise. The sticking part is that he refuses to and is adamant that the 9yo who hasn't had time to unpack needs to participate in a day long cleaning session.", "What does this even mean. \"honey we got guests, now I made up stuff to clean for 2 people that needs cleaning today!!!\"\n\nThe child is basically a guest and the father didn't wanted to hear any compromise.", "Friday night* according to OP", "It takes kids longer to \u201csettle\u201d than adults. This kid is already  back and forth between mom and dad, and now he\u2019s in his stepmom\u2019s father\u2019s house while visiting dad. That\u2019s gotta be confusing and strange already, and then this person who isn\u2019t even related to him expects him\u2014a 9 year old\u2014 to help clean his house and be \u201cthankful\u201d? A child doesn\u2019t need to show gratitude like that. And it\u2019s weird that an adult not related to him is so concerned about parenting him.", "A couple of hours difference in no way effects my main point and you know it.", "Literally just to take out the trash which took approximately 3 minutes. Where as washing dishes for a family of overeaters took sometimes over an hour", "Oh my. And you said your FIL is a \"my way or the highway\" type person? Take a look in the mirror.", "I don't know why he wouldn't have done that to start with instead of imposing on his FIL?", "Plus sleeping time shouldn't count because they didn't experience it", "It is from the sun, just not directly, thanks to the magic of photosynthesis and the food chain", "Four years, and she has never tried to parent my son. My ex has a fiance, and he has the same understanding. He isn't a father and knows better than to try and be one.", "Obviously if I'm unavailable, his mother would be the one picking him up. She wouldn't want someone else watching her son.", "Get the villa. It's a favor to FIL too, it will prevent your relationship going to hell.", "If you can afford a vacation villa then why are you staying with her dad for so long to begin with?", "You keep whining about how your FIL is my way or high way, but you are even worse. Poor kid.", "He asked us to stay with him between the closing on the house we sold and the one we are buying so he can spend time with his daughter and grandkids."]}
