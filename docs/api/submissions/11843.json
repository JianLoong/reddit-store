Living with her as been a little bit of a struggle because she's a very messy person. She leaves her clothes everywhere on the floor & on the bed. Can't be bothered to fold or hang up her clothes in the closet. I swear she uses our bed as a closet. She sometimes brings food into the room & doesn't throw it away. even worse she sometimes puts the garbage under the bed so I don't complain about it. \n\nI don't even want to get started on what the bathroom looks like, I had to start using the guest bathroom\n\nI understand that having depression can make it harder for someone to take care of themselves & their environment. But I feel like there is a limit to where you're just using it as an excuse to just do whatever & not care . Especially when you're living in someone's else home. \n\nI keep telling her to clean up after herself & that I'm tired of cleaning up after a grown woman & she always responds with that she has depression & ADHD. Which I don't see how that's an excuse. You have depression, sure. How does that make you leave garbage everywhere & be a slob? I don't get it. You're an adult. Act like it. \n\nShe got angry & accused me of not giving a fuck about what she is going through & called be an  Unsympathetic  moron. Apparently I'm not being supportive & understanding of her mental health because I have a problem with her treating my house like it's a garbage dump. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like I was overly harsh because I probably could've addressed this issue in a friendlier way, but after many attempts of trying to get her to be more clean & pick up after herself, I just had enough.", "created_utc": 1678343657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ml160/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_her_having/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I used to live with an ex partner and we had the same exact problem, only that he was incredibly patient, and not pushy at all. But still, nothing ever changed, so after 2 years, he broke up with me because he couldn't take it anymore.  And I get it. It was for the better.\n\nSo I understand how hard it is for your girlfriend. I assure you she's not trying to make an excuse; it's legitimately almost impossible a lot of the time to get shit done. The only thing that's helping me with it is a service where a sort of therapist comes to my house once a week and helps me do everything I need to. Not sure where you're from, if that's an option and affordable, but I'm just dropping it here.\n\nAnyway, since I used to have a partner who was in your shoes, I understand your struggle as well, and I don't think you're an asshole. I think you're insensitive and harsh, but you're very frustrated, and I get that.\n\nHere's the thing: The messiness of your girlfriend is not going to change anytime soon. It is possible for her to learn to deal with it and become better at picking up after herself. But most people with ADHD struggle with keeping a space clean, and when you have depression on top of that, there's honestly a lot of things a person usually has to deal with first, before they feel ready to tackle the cleanliness problem.\n\nSo honestly, I don't think living together is working for either of you. It's making you very frustrated and resentful, and it's increasing her anxiety and depression.\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr: Neither of you is an asshole. You're understandibly very frustrated, and you need things to change in order to feel comfortable. She's struggling with things that are very difficult and take a long time to learn to deal with. The situation is unhealthy for both of you.\n\n\nIf you want to try to make it work, I recommend looking up ways to help with someone who has ADHD/depression. There's a lot of grear ressources on the internet", "INFO: Is she getting the therapeutic support she needs?\n\nI don't necessarily thing you are an asshole, just want to consider if she has access to appropriate care for her conditions.", "NTA - Unless she\u2019s in the process of seeking for medical care or some type of treatment for her depression. \n\nAs much as one can try to be understanding, we all have a breaking point. I can\u2019t imagine living in a house, let alone a room, like that so I can\u2019t blame you for your outburst. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re just incompatible because she needs to work on her issues and you aren\u2019t in a space where you want to fully support another person.", "INFO: is she on medication? Is she in therapy?", "NAH. The issues you have listed are definitely some of the main struggles with depression and ADHD. But that doesn't mean you have to live in filth in order to be supportive to her, nor do you need to clean everything alone. Her mental illness explains the issues, it doesn't excuse them. She has to find some kind of treatment that helps her function, simply allowing and excusing or enabling her illness will only push her further into it. To use a metaphor, it's like a person with the flu saying they need you to support them by watching them hack and sneeze and throw up, etc, but refuse to medicate, or shower, or hydrate or eat chicken soup, etc. It's okay to struggle with these things, it isn't okay to neglect treatment of them. Good luck to you both.", "INFO : what is she doing to get better? is she making an effort, does she take any medication, is she in therapy? If not than NTA she doesn't want to get better or is taking advantage of the situation. \n\nIs this behavior why she is on bad terms with her parents?", "Info: how long has she been diagnosed with depression and ADHD? Is she seeing a doctor and in therapy, on medication, etc and for how long?", "NAH. \n\nHer inability to clean up after herself and being a slob is a well known symptom of her mental health issues so that doesn't make her an AH.\n\nYou have a limited understanding of her conditions and you expect a certain standard of cleanliness, especially around garbage being hidden which could encourage vermin. It's your home and you don't want to live in a dump so for that you're not the AH either.\n\nI would suggest she moves back with her parents or finds somewhere else to live as she won't live to your standards and you're already clearly vexed with her. Resenting her is not a recipe for a good long term relationship.", "NTA there\u2019s no excuse for hiding garbage under the bed just so she doesn\u2019t have to hear about it", "I mean, NTA for not wanting a dirty house, but definitely an AH for calling depression an excuse and thinking that belittling and minimizing it is anything but damaging to both your relationship and her mental health. Like\u2026 there\u2019s bigger issues here. I have depression/ADHD and so does my partner and we get along just fine, with like, mutual respect and support. You do not speak of her with either of these things.  Consider you might not be compatible.", "NTA. If her depression is this severe she needs medical intervention. If shes on meds she needs them checked. Or she needs to stop making excuses. \nYes depression can causes long bouts of not cleaning, and adhd can make it harder to focus/finish a task. \nBoth are manageable with treatment and help. \n\nI have depression, anxiety and PTSD. It can get bad. Like bad bad. But I when it's not I focus on maintaining my house. And when it is bad I find motivation outside of myself to do it. For me it's my child. If I dont do things for her then no one will. So I have to do it. Dosent make it easy. And some days I fail. But I atleast try.", "NTA\n\nYou both DO NOT NEED TO LIVE TOGETHER. This is a recipe for disaster. She needs help that you can't give her, and you have EVERY RIGHT to want to live in a clean home. You all will end up resenting each other if this living arrangement continues. You are both justified in how you feel, unfortunately, your feelings are conflicting. She needs to go back to her parents' home or go elsewhere if she can't respect your home. Also, you can't handle her symptoms at this time.", "Info\n\nHave you thought about the long term?  Do you see the rest of your life dealing with this?\n\nHonestly if I was you I would break up.  \n\nSure she might have mental illness but do you want to deal with it?   Doesn't sound like you want to.", "At the end of the day if she\u2019s not getting help and working towards being better for HER own well being then, as someone already stated, it\u2019s an excuse but only because she seems to be aware of what\u2019s wrong with her. depression can hit hard and  be absolutely debilitating. as for the ADHD, it manifests in different ways. The depression seems more likely here. Also maybe not super relevant but from personal experience, if the core reason of moving in was to escape her current situation, this likely won\u2019t turn out well for both parties. \n\nUltimately whether you both are splitting rent or you\u2019re fronting the bill, it\u2019s both of your space and you have to decide whether you can commit to this or you can respectfully choose to move on. \n\nIf she\u2019s not in treatment - NTA\nIf she is in treatment, amazing but still NTA. Sugar whatever peach in another comment is going hard in the paint but as someone who is neurodivergent, no one is accountable for my behavior nor should it be expected for others to put their very reasonable feelings aside to accommodate my issues.", "NTA\n\nI have depression. It may take me a few days here and there to keep it clean, but I still try and make an effort. I know once I've cleaned, yes, I'm tired, but I feel good that I accomplished the task. \n\nADHD, depending on her diagnosis, is difficult, but there are strategies she can employ to assist. \n\nYou were probably rude when you spoke to her, but read the comments and find a happy medium. Also, if she's living with you, shouldn't it be 'our house' not what you stated.", "Hi there, I'm autistic and ADHD and have suffered from depression much of my life, next time she gets on you saying that she has them so it's hard, say yes, I understand that it's hard, but I'm not obligated to put up with your mental health issues, especially when it's causing me to have issues of my own, the fact that it upsets me so much means it's affecting my mental health as well so you need to find a coping mechanisms so you can get these things done and not just use your mental health as an excuse to not do it, btw op your NTA", "NTA.  Mental illness (and self-diagnosed, at that) is not an excuse to move into someone\u2019s place and turn it into a pigsty.  You could have approached this in a nicer way somewhere along the line, but if she is not even TRYING to do better or acknowledging that her behavior is a problem, dude\u2026I hate to say it, but you may need to kick her to the curb.  If she is not even trying now, it\u2019s not going to be any better later.", "NTA - the hiding shit under the bed is where I draw the line. That's disgusting and it sounds like she isn't taking responsibility for her problems. I get it, as someone with schizoaffective - depressive disorder and adhd, it can be hard to function normally sometimes but it's not an excuse to just not try, which is what it sounds like here.\n\nYou shouldn't be forced to live this way. If you've talked about it multiple times and she doesn't seem like she's making an effort, then you need to rethink her living with you.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA. I can see why it would be frustrating. I\u2019m bipolar and ADHD, and yeah\u2026 sometimes my shit does *not* look cute. I try to stay on top of stuff but ADHD makes it hard. If I\u2019m depressed, it\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that. \n\nHave you spoken to your girlfriend about her mental health, or just bullied her about how the symptoms are affecting you? Approaching it in a manner of trying to help come up with solutions would be better than what you\u2019re doing now.", "NTA - being depressed and having ADHD are not the person's fault. But they are their responsibility. It's not an excuse to be an asshole. Depression in particular makes it hard to take care of personal and home hygiene and often you don't even have the energy or will to take medication or seek help. But things like garbage under the bed and bathroom hygiene is a hard boundary. Her right to swing her metaphorical fist ends where your face begins. You need to start thinking about what the rest of your life is going to look like. Is she diagnosed? Was this the same reason she ended up on bad terms with her parents?", "NTA \n\nDepression doesn't mean she gets to treat your house like a dump. Hiding rubbish under the bed is fucking disgusting. She should at least be making an effort to tidy. \n\nYeah you probably could have been nicer but she likely wouldn't have changed her behaviour anyway. You are probably seeing why she was having issues with her parents. \n\nI have ADHD and depression so I can sympathise with her but I also make sure I manage my issues so that they aren't impacting my family. She needs to be an adult and take steps to sort herself out and stop living like a pig.", "NTA its harder to want to do anything but she should be doing these things, it\u2019s not fair to you that she is abusing your kindness", "First- NAH\n\nSecond - Executive dysfunction and task exhaustion. \n\nFor me, I know I need to wash the dishes. I know that I will regret not washing the dishes if I don\u2019t do them now but I physically cannot engage in the task of washing the dishes. My brain is overwhelmed and refuses the new task. I feel like a  defective lazy slob and fight with my living mates later when they\u2019re upset about the dishes. I work with my psych to find meds that allow me to do the dishes and my therapist for coping mechanisms and ways to hack my neurodivergent brain. \n\nADHD and depression is an explanation, not an excuse. It isn\u2019t her fault she struggles with these but it is her responsibility to manage them so they do not negatively impact those around her. It requires empathy, understanding and compromise from all involved. She needs to get herself to a psychiatrist and therapist and start working on a treatment plan to help manager her disorders.", "NTA.  I totally get the lack of motivation coming from a depressed person, but it really doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s trying to help herself if she is being destructive and blowing you off with her diagnoses.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong at all, you\u2019re just fed up with someone who isn\u2019t willing to help herself.  Rotten food and garbage everywhere crosses a line, and you shouldn\u2019t have to be trapped in squalor.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to expect her to meet bare minimum standards of cleanliness", "\"due to her being on bad terms with her parents.\"   \" & called be an Unsympathetic moron\"\n\nSo I think you now know why she is on bad terms with her parents.  I hate it when people jump to \"break up with him/her\" on Reddit but in all honesty. How long are you going to do this for? Considering she isn't even willing to recognise it's unreasonable.\n\nI 'm a bit of a slob too but I found that cleaning an entire room was actually a great way to relive depression. Just helps you feel more in control and makes other people happy.", "NTA. Compassion is called for here, if she is depressed, and there are plenty of nice ways to tell someone to pick up their shit. ADHD can present challenges; they\u2019re not insurmountable. (As someone with ADHD.)\n\nHowever, she doesn\u2019t get to use that as a banner to destroy your living space, especially when she\u2019s living in the apartment you pay for. Then, she\u2019s hurting your mental health. (And physical health\u2014the food thing is a literal health hazard.) She needs to seek treatment, if it\u2019s that bad, and work out effective strategies for maintaining a minimum of cleanliness if she\u2019s not living on her own dime.", "NTA. Having a clean living space is the bare minimum of living with someone. She needs to get treatment for her disorders and work on improving herself.", "NAH. Mental illness is complicated man. Depression is the cause of all of those things you\u2019re talking about. It can even cause issues with what is called executive function - in practice it\u2019s more helpful to think of depression as a disability than a mental illness, because depressed people straight up CAN\u2019T function, going well beyond not wanting to.\n\nWhat she\u2019s doing is not rooted in disrespect for you. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t absolve an individual from all personal accountability either. And they can bring the negative traits they had before they were depressed and they become amplified. How does one judge that?\n\nYou have a choice to accept her as she is and support her. You also have a choice not to. Neither would make you an asshole.", "NTA! I've been here.  I was exactly like the crappy girlfriend once upon a time, complete with TRMDD and ADHD.  What finally got me out of it? My incredibly supportive SO finally had enough of living like that, and did exactly what OP did (only OP was much nicer/calmer).\n\nYou're doing her a favor, OP! She probably doesn't think it's much of a favor right now, but she *needs* to hear it.  I know each of us is different, so that's only my two cents based on my own experience in my own head. Results may vary, of course. Take what you'd like from this recovering former megaslob with the same conditions.", "I have bipolar and have been hospitalized. There they teach you this one thing people with mental illnesses or disabilities absolutely HATE hearing, but that changes your life. \"You are responsible for your own illness/disability,  it is NOT an excuse and it is not anybody else's responsibility.\". I know, I know, it's a tough thing to hear, but it's the way it is. And every single person I know who follows the rule does better mentally.\n\nEdit for judgment: nta", "ESH\n\nAs someone who once struggled with depression and has ADHD, I can definitely understand where you're gf is coming from. I think you're TA for some of the way you've written about her / depression here - in particular the \"using it as an excuse\" line.\n\nThat being said, it is on her to articulate what she needs/to do *something* about it. For me, I made a list of 3 things I was going to do each day and it kept me going. The house wasn't clean overnight, but it did stop things from getting out of hand for those I loved.\n\nThere is a light at the other end for both of you and I hope all works out.", "NTA and honestly, she's got self work to handle, before being a live in GF. This is not a healthy start for a life together.", "NTA. She may have depression, but that doesn't justify her disrespecting you and your home, and her apparently expecting you to be her butler.", "NAH\n\nHer mental illness makes what seems like simple tasks to you insurmountable tasks to her.\nBut she needs to understand that her mental illness does not mean she gets to disrespect her partner by making his living space unwelcoming and inhospitable for you!!!\nOver time this will lead to massive resentment between the 2 of you, her because she will feel overwhelmed and guilty all the time, and you because living in a dirty home sounds like a deal breaker for you.\n\nThink long and hard about the road forward, the cluter only gets worse with time and it may be that the 2 of you are just not compatible to be living together right now\n\nFor ADHD people with depression less is more. Try to get rid of unneeded and unused stuff. Having a dedicated space for every single thing also helps.\nIf she cannot take out uneaten food from the bedroom then no more eating in the bedroom. Meals and snacks can only be eaten in the kitchen or dining room. \n\nAgain, putting methods into place to help her cope changes the dynamic of the relationship to one of caretaker, which can ruin the relationship.", "ESH - I think you could have addressed this better and you should probably try to educate yourself on depression. \n\nThat being said, moving into someone\u2019s house and hiding old food under their bed to rot is absolutely disgusting. Your girlfriend should be doing everything she can to get better because living like that is unhealthy, unsustainable and frankly vile. Especially as she doesn\u2019t own the place.", "NTA. I'm sure there are nicer ways to get her to be a considerate housemate (and support her mental health improvement), but I don't blame you for snapping. She's leaving all her mess on you. That's not acceptable. \n\nShe should be seeing a therapist and working on the issues.", "NTA, she can't excuse everything with ADHD and depression. Also, had she seen a specialist? Coz nowaday too many people self diagnose and weaponize their diagnosis to be excused from everything.\n\nHer being such a slob is taking a toll on YOUR mental health, it's time to have a serious talk with her and if no changes happen - ask her to find anohter living arrangement", "NTA.  She's a capable adult and shoud be held accountable.  And it would probably due her depression good if she got into a routine of such things and make her feel more responsible.  If she continues, you might consider cutting your losses.", "NTA. If she knows she has both of those things, she should be actively trying to seek out help with them. Is she on medication? If not, she might need to be. \n\nADHD is something she's going to have to live with all of her life. She needs to adjust to it and get a handle on it, instead of trashing your house. She's making her problem your problem. While I understand that it's a battle, she doesn't seem like she cares about how you feel.", "NTA - depression and ADHD can make it more difficult to keep things neat and tidy, but it\u2019s not an excuse. Living in a messy dump can also make symptoms of depression worse, I mean who wouldn\u2019t be unhappy living like that? \n\nWhenever I\u2019m having low moods I see the mess grow in my place as well. If I\u2019m in a bad place mentally I always make a \u201cdeal\u201d with myself so to say, and I tell myself I can do x if I only pick up and clean up 5 things. Then another 5 things, and another.. until the place is clean. Sometimes might take a short break in the middle if really struggling.", "NAH You both need to work on this together. \n\nFirst: You need to inform yourself about her case of depression the best you can. One known symptome is a problem with decission making and concentration. For you it might be a simple task, but your girlfriend might have trouble to start. Example: She changes clothes. The best way would be to open the wardrobe, get a hanger,  take clothes of and put them on the hanger, hang the hanger on the wardrobe to let the clothes air out. If the clothes are dirty put them in a laundry basket and sort them by wash load.\nThis does not happen, because your girlfriend does not have the concentration to get the steps. She takes her clothes of and does not know what to do next. They are in her hand and she cannot get the next steps in order. She cannot concentrate, she does not have the energy. She might get a little frightened and she starts having self doubt. This should be so easy. Why isn't it? Why is she such a failure? This costs extra energy. She now has even less. If she does not find a solution she might not change her clothes in the future at all and this would be even worse. She just puts it on the bed for the moment. Only until she feels better. She will remember the steps then. Repeat for 5 days and you habe a pile of clothing on the bed. \n\nIt is not laziness. It is about being completly overwelmed with a task. Even if she wanted to fix the problem this causes more problems. Doing laundry: is the washing maschine freely accessable? If she has to take washed laundry out and dry it, it is an extra step. If there is anything in the way, extra step. The laundry is not sorted by colors or fabric.  Maybe she needs to look into the pockets if there is trash or money. Is laundry detergent there? Even worse if you live in a community building with washers in the basement. Does she look okay? Does she need to shower? Does she need to get dressed?\nA simple task becomes a giant cloud of things that you cannot control and are not able to get in order. A simple task of 10 mins became a 2 hour task. You get the feeling that you can just not do it. If you are preassured by a partner it can get even worse  because now the intrusive thoughts start again. You are a failure, nobody can ever love you, he will leave her soon, because she cannot do basic things, etc. \n\nThere are technics to work around this and this is were your girlfriend needs to get to work. She needs therapy. A complete programm were she learns how to manage her day again. Adequate medications. Maybe a personal help to get her started. I don't know if your country does offer something like this or if you are able to afford it, but it can help a lot. \n\nYour girlfriend is not a slob on purpose or because she is lazy. She is struggling. At least she needs to try to get to a point were she is functioning. This will take years just to be clear. Getting better takes time and 3 steps forward can be followed by 2 steps back.", "NTA\n\n\nMy bf is very depressed, so now I help him wash his hair and I make food but he won't throw uneaten food under the bed and won't blame his illness for mess he tends to make. He can be a bit untidy and I am untidy by nature. Still, we are trying be better.\n\nNot ESH or NAH because you have discussed it so many times I presume you are irritated by simple coming home.", "NTA \n\nPerhaps gently suggest she live elsewhere where she can live the way she like and then the time together can be fun and loving without the animosity built up of how you live together.", "I can relate to your sitution. My wife has depression and PTSD and acted just like your girlfriend for some time.\nBecaus of that I'd say ESH. \nI get that you are annoyed and want her to change those habits, but the way you talk about her and her problems are very disrespectfull. Try to be understanding and for example if you want her to clean something encurage her and help with it. Don't just push her to do it.\n\nOn the other hand your girlfriend needs therapy. It's good to know what the Problems are, but she has to do something to handle those.\nOnly that can realy help her and if she starts working on herself you two can slowly start to work on the actions that trouble you.", "YTA.\n\nInstead of being verbally abusive towards someone who is very clearly struggling, why not encourage them to, I don't know; GO TO THERAPY AND GET HELP???", ">she always responds with that she has depression & ADHD. Which I don't see how that's an excuse. You have depression, sure. How does that make you leave garbage everywhere & be a slob? I don't get it.\n\nYour lack of understanding about a well documented side effect of those two conditions is not an excuse for you to verbally abuse your girlfriend. You're allowed to want a clean house, that's fine, but wtf do you think you treating her like shit is going to accomplish? Major YTA. Why even be with her if you're going to talk to and about her like that?", "I'm going to say ESH.\n\nYta for the way you are handling her mental health. Your approach is wrong and honestly comes off as if you can't stand her. If you knew she had these mental health hurdles prior to her moving in then you should be more patient and understanding. \n\nHowever\n\nShe's, also the AH for not pushing and motivating herself to at least throw away her garbage, or put something away after she is done with it or rinse her dish off. It's really about putting effort into those small things to start rebuilding herself. This has been an on going issue, so it's obvious she's just been feeding into her mental health.\n\nWhat would she do if you just up and left her tomorrow? Would she be able to stand on her own two feet? If not, then she needs to get into therapy or iop/cbt programs, yesterday. If she already is, they have not been going in the right direction and other options need to be explored, ASAP.", "NTA. You do need to take some time and learn how mental illness works and its symptoms. However if she has issues it\u2019s her responsibility to seek help and get better, she can\u2019t just trash your place and expect the world to accommodate her forever. Encourage her to find a therapist or look up other resources together maybe, if she refuses all the help I would break up.", "NTA but it sounds like she needs professional help. you could\u2019ve been nicer about it as you mentioned, but there\u2019s a breaking point when someone is blatantly disrespecting your home. depression and ADHD are explanations, not excuses", "NTA.\n\nMost people in my family have major depression, but they can still act like adults and tidy the fuck up.\n\nYes it's hard, but life isn't just about doing the easy stuff.", "Ooh, this is a difficult one. My verdict is NTA, why don't you guys go to therapy and get some medication?", "Nta as someone who used to be like that kind of (while I have my clothes on my bed but I just put them there and i really don\u2019t wanna do them lol) you said it fine so she shouldn\u2019t be mad", "NTA, Jesus fucking Christ. \n\nShe is HIDING food UNDER THE BED. \n\nI have adhd and depression since I was 9, now 21.

Living with her as been a little bit of a struggle because she's a very messy person. She leaves her clothes everywhere on the floor & on the bed. Can't be bothered to fold or hang up her clothes in the closet. I swear she uses our bed as a closet. She sometimes brings food into the room & doesn't throw it away. even worse she sometimes puts the garbage under the bed so I don't complain about it. \n\nI don't even want to get started on what the bathroom looks like, I had to start using the guest bathroom\n\nI understand that having depression can make it harder for someone to take care of themselves & their environment. But I feel like there is a limit to where you're just using it as an excuse to just do whatever & not care . Especially when you're living in someone's else home. \n\nI keep telling her to clean up after herself & that I'm tired of cleaning up after a grown woman & she always responds with that she has depression & ADHD. Which I don't see how that's an excuse. You have depression, sure. How does that make you leave garbage everywhere & be a slob? I don't get it. You're an adult. Act like it. \n\nShe got angry & accused me of not giving a fuck about what she is going through & called be an  Unsympathetic  moron. Apparently I'm not being supportive & understanding of her mental health because I have a problem with her treating my house like it's a garbage dump. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like I was overly harsh because I probably could've addressed this issue in a friendlier way, but after many attempts of trying to get her to be more clean & pick up after herself, I just had enough.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She might be annoyed but it is probably what she needs. The hard thing for her can be to know where to start. If the mess is already huge she might be very overwhelmed, you need to tell her where to start. It might be too much for you to handle being with her, but if you want to give it a shot I think this is the way", "NTA. It's absolutely true that depression and ADHD make cleaning very hard. But there's a limit. One thing that feels like a red flag is that you haven't mentioned any days where she feels ok and starts to look after herself.

I\u2019m of the opinion that if you want things done a certain way, you\u2019ll have to do it that way. It\u2019s not fair for you to expect others to live up to your expectations of cleanliness. I came to this conclusion because I am the clean one and it was just easier to accept that others have different standards. \n\nDepression sucks and can make it hard to do things. But you can\u2019t motivate her to change her habits with your current approach. And honestly, it may just be her way of living.\n\nAlso, when you first move out on your own and you don\u2019t have your parents on your case to do chores, lots of people simply exercise their right to not do them. She may just need some time to grow up. Living in clutter and filth gets old after a while. She\u2019s probably also overwhelmed by the process of cleaning up. Sometimes it helps to break the process down into little steps. She might need encouragement and direction. Like, tell her to first separate clean clothes from dirty clothes. When that\u2019s done, tell her to put the dirty clothes in the washer. Now, while that\u2019s running, put the clean clothes away. Then, rotate laundry. Now, pick up all the dishes around the house and put them in the sink. Now it\u2019s time to fold laundry. That\u2019s enough for today, tomorrow we\u2019ll tackle the bathroom. \n\nHowever, you may want to reevaluate your relationship. We can\u2019t help the way we feel.
