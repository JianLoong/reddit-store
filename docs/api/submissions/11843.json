Living with her as been a little bit of a struggle because she's a very messy person. She leaves her clothes everywhere on the floor & on the bed. Can't be bothered to fold or hang up her clothes in the closet. I swear she uses our bed as a closet. She sometimes brings food into the room & doesn't throw it away. even worse she sometimes puts the garbage under the bed so I don't complain about it. \n\nI don't even want to get started on what the bathroom looks like, I had to start using the guest bathroom\n\nI understand that having depression can make it harder for someone to take care of themselves & their environment. But I feel like there is a limit to where you're just using it as an excuse to just do whatever & not care . Especially when you're living in someone's else home. \n\nI keep telling her to clean up after herself & that I'm tired of cleaning up after a grown woman & she always responds with that she has depression & ADHD. Which I don't see how that's an excuse. You have depression, sure. How does that make you leave garbage everywhere & be a slob? I don't get it. You're an adult. Act like it. \n\nShe got angry & accused me of not giving a fuck about what she is going through & called be an  Unsympathetic  moron. Apparently I'm not being supportive & understanding of her mental health because I have a problem with her treating my house like it's a garbage dump. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like I was overly harsh because I probably could've addressed this issue in a friendlier way, but after many attempts of trying to get her to be more clean & pick up after herself, I just had enough.", "created_utc": 1678343657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ml160/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_her_having/", "score": 2187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I used to live with an ex partner and we had the same exact problem, only that he was incredibly patient, and not pushy at all. But still, nothing ever changed, so after 2 years, he broke up with me because he couldn't take it anymore.  And I get it. It was for the better.\n\nSo I understand how hard it is for your girlfriend. I assure you she's not trying to make an excuse; it's legitimately almost impossible a lot of the time to get shit done. The only thing that's helping me with it is a service where a sort of therapist comes to my house once a week and helps me do everything I need to. Not sure where you're from, if that's an option and affordable, but I'm just dropping it here.\n\nAnyway, since I used to have a partner who was in your shoes, I understand your struggle as well, and I don't think you're an asshole. I think you're insensitive and harsh, but you're very frustrated, and I get that.\n\nHere's the thing: The messiness of your girlfriend is not going to change anytime soon. It is possible for her to learn to deal with it and become better at picking up after herself. But most people with ADHD struggle with keeping a space clean, and when you have depression on top of that, there's honestly a lot of things a person usually has to deal with first, before they feel ready to tackle the cleanliness problem.\n\nSo honestly, I don't think living together is working for either of you. It's making you very frustrated and resentful, and it's increasing her anxiety and depression.\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr: Neither of you is an asshole. You're understandibly very frustrated, and you need things to change in order to feel comfortable. She's struggling with things that are very difficult and take a long time to learn to deal with. The situation is unhealthy for both of you.\n\n\nIf you want to try to make it work, I recommend looking up ways to help with someone who has ADHD/depression. There's a lot of grear ressources on the internet", "INFO: Is she getting the therapeutic support she needs?\n\nI don't necessarily thing you are an asshole, just want to consider if she has access to appropriate care for her conditions.", "NTA - Unless she\u2019s in the process of seeking for medical care or some type of treatment for her depression. \n\nAs much as one can try to be understanding, we all have a breaking point. I can\u2019t imagine living in a house, let alone a room, like that so I can\u2019t blame you for your outburst. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re just incompatible because she needs to work on her issues and you aren\u2019t in a space where you want to fully support another person.", "INFO: is she on medication? Is she in therapy?", "NAH. The issues you have listed are definitely some of the main struggles with depression and ADHD. But that doesn't mean you have to live in filth in order to be supportive to her, nor do you need to clean everything alone. Her mental illness explains the issues, it doesn't excuse them. She has to find some kind of treatment that helps her function, simply allowing and excusing or enabling her illness will only push her further into it. To use a metaphor, it's like a person with the flu saying they need you to support them by watching them hack and sneeze and throw up, etc, but refuse to medicate, or shower, or hydrate or eat chicken soup, etc. It's okay to struggle with these things, it isn't okay to neglect treatment of them. Good luck to you both.", "INFO : what is she doing to get better? is she making an effort, does she take any medication, is she in therapy? If not than NTA she doesn't want to get better or is taking advantage of the situation. \n\nIs this behavior why she is on bad terms with her parents?", "Info: how long has she been diagnosed with depression and ADHD? Is she seeing a doctor and in therapy, on medication, etc and for how long?", "Her inability to clean up after herself and being a slob is a well known symptom of her mental health issues so that doesn't make her an AH.\n\nYou have a limited understanding of her conditions and you expect a certain standard of cleanliness, especially around garbage being hidden which could encourage vermin. It's your home and you don't want to live in a dump so for that you're not the AH either.\n\nI would suggest she moves back with her parents or finds somewhere else to live as she won't live to your standards and you're already clearly vexed with her. Resenting her is not a recipe for a good long term relationship.\n\nEDIT: changing my vote to NTA. I see in your comments that her issues aren't an actual diagnosis, just something she's decided she has and is seeking no help for. That totally makes her the AH.", "NTA there\u2019s no excuse for hiding garbage under the bed just so she doesn\u2019t have to hear about it", "I mean, NTA for not wanting a dirty house, but definitely an AH for calling depression an excuse and thinking that belittling and minimizing it is anything but damaging to both your relationship and her mental health. Like\u2026 there\u2019s bigger issues here. I have depression/ADHD and so does my partner and we get along just fine, with like, mutual respect and support. You do not speak of her with either of these things.  Consider you might not be compatible.", "NTA. If her depression is this severe she needs medical intervention. If shes on meds she needs them checked. Or she needs to stop making excuses. \nYes depression can causes long bouts of not cleaning, and adhd can make it harder to focus/finish a task. \nBoth are manageable with treatment and help. \n\nI have depression, anxiety and PTSD. It can get bad. Like bad bad. But I when it's not I focus on maintaining my house. And when it is bad I find motivation outside of myself to do it. For me it's my child. If I dont do things for her then no one will. So I have to do it. Dosent make it easy. And some days I fail. But I atleast try.", "NTA\n\nYou both DO NOT NEED TO LIVE TOGETHER. This is a recipe for disaster. She needs help that you can't give her, and you have EVERY RIGHT to want to live in a clean home. You all will end up resenting each other if this living arrangement continues. You are both justified in how you feel, unfortunately, your feelings are conflicting. She needs to go back to her parents' home or go elsewhere if she can't respect your home. Also, you can't handle her symptoms at this time.", "Info\n\nHave you thought about the long term?  Do you see the rest of your life dealing with this?\n\nHonestly if I was you I would break up.  \n\nSure she might have mental illness but do you want to deal with it?   Doesn't sound like you want to.", "At the end of the day if she\u2019s not getting help and working towards being better for HER own well being then, as someone already stated, it\u2019s an excuse but only because she seems to be aware of what\u2019s wrong with her. depression can hit hard and  be absolutely debilitating. as for the ADHD, it manifests in different ways. The depression seems more likely here. Also maybe not super relevant but from personal experience, if the core reason of moving in was to escape her current situation, this likely won\u2019t turn out well for both parties. \n\nUltimately whether you both are splitting rent or you\u2019re fronting the bill, it\u2019s both of your space and you have to decide whether you can commit to this or you can respectfully choose to move on. \n\nIf she\u2019s not in treatment - NTA\nIf she is in treatment, amazing but still NTA. Sugar whatever peach in another comment is going hard in the paint but as someone who is neurodivergent, no one is accountable for my behavior nor should it be expected for others to put their very reasonable feelings aside to accommodate my issues.", "NTA\n\nI have depression. It may take me a few days here and there to keep it clean, but I still try and make an effort. I know once I've cleaned, yes, I'm tired, but I feel good that I accomplished the task. \n\nADHD, depending on her diagnosis, is difficult, but there are strategies she can employ to assist. \n\nYou were probably rude when you spoke to her, but read the comments and find a happy medium. Also, if she's living with you, shouldn't it be 'our house' not what you stated.", "Hi there, I'm autistic and ADHD and have suffered from depression much of my life, next time she gets on you saying that she has them so it's hard, say yes, I understand that it's hard, but I'm not obligated to put up with your mental health issues, especially when it's causing me to have issues of my own, the fact that it upsets me so much means it's affecting my mental health as well so you need to find a coping mechanisms so you can get these things done and not just use your mental health as an excuse to not do it, btw op your NTA", "NTA.  Mental illness (and self-diagnosed, at that) is not an excuse to move into someone\u2019s place and turn it into a pigsty.  You could have approached this in a nicer way somewhere along the line, but if she is not even TRYING to do better or acknowledging that her behavior is a problem, dude\u2026I hate to say it, but you may need to kick her to the curb.  If she is not even trying now, it\u2019s not going to be any better later.", "NTA - the hiding shit under the bed is where I draw the line. That's disgusting and it sounds like she isn't taking responsibility for her problems. I get it, as someone with schizoaffective - depressive disorder and adhd, it can be hard to function normally sometimes but it's not an excuse to just not try, which is what it sounds like here.\n\nYou shouldn't be forced to live this way. If you've talked about it multiple times and she doesn't seem like she's making an effort, then you need to rethink her living with you.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA. I can see why it would be frustrating. I\u2019m bipolar and ADHD, and yeah\u2026 sometimes my shit does *not* look cute. I try to stay on top of stuff but ADHD makes it hard. If I\u2019m depressed, it\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that. \n\nHave you spoken to your girlfriend about her mental health, or just bullied her about how the symptoms are affecting you? Approaching it in a manner of trying to help come up with solutions would be better than what you\u2019re doing now.", "NTA - being depressed and having ADHD are not the person's fault. But they are their responsibility. It's not an excuse to be an asshole. Depression in particular makes it hard to take care of personal and home hygiene and often you don't even have the energy or will to take medication or seek help. But things like garbage under the bed and bathroom hygiene is a hard boundary. Her right to swing her metaphorical fist ends where your face begins. You need to start thinking about what the rest of your life is going to look like. Is she diagnosed? Was this the same reason she ended up on bad terms with her parents?", "NTA \n\nDepression doesn't mean she gets to treat your house like a dump. Hiding rubbish under the bed is fucking disgusting. She should at least be making an effort to tidy. \n\nYeah you probably could have been nicer but she likely wouldn't have changed her behaviour anyway. You are probably seeing why she was having issues with her parents. \n\nI have ADHD and depression so I can sympathise with her but I also make sure I manage my issues so that they aren't impacting my family. She needs to be an adult and take steps to sort herself out and stop living like a pig.", "NTA its harder to want to do anything but she should be doing these things, it\u2019s not fair to you that she is abusing your kindness", "First- NAH\n\nSecond - Executive dysfunction and task exhaustion. \n\nFor me, I know I need to wash the dishes. I know that I will regret not washing the dishes if I don\u2019t do them now but I physically cannot engage in the task of washing the dishes. My brain is overwhelmed and refuses the new task. I feel like a  defective lazy slob and fight with my living mates later when they\u2019re upset about the dishes. I work with my psych to find meds that allow me to do the dishes and my therapist for coping mechanisms and ways to hack my neurodivergent brain. \n\nADHD and depression is an explanation, not an excuse. It isn\u2019t her fault she struggles with these but it is her responsibility to manage them so they do not negatively impact those around her. It requires empathy, understanding and compromise from all involved. She needs to get herself to a psychiatrist and therapist and start working on a treatment plan to help manager her disorders.", "NTA.  I totally get the lack of motivation coming from a depressed person, but it really doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s trying to help herself if she is being destructive and blowing you off with her diagnoses.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong at all, you\u2019re just fed up with someone who isn\u2019t willing to help herself.  Rotten food and garbage everywhere crosses a line, and you shouldn\u2019t have to be trapped in squalor.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to expect her to meet bare minimum standards of cleanliness", "\"due to her being on bad terms with her parents.\"   \" & called be an Unsympathetic moron\"\n\nSo I think you now know why she is on bad terms with her parents.  I hate it when people jump to \"break up with him/her\" on Reddit but in all honesty. How long are you going to do this for? Considering she isn't even willing to recognise it's unreasonable.\n\nI 'm a bit of a slob too but I found that cleaning an entire room was actually a great way to relive depression. Just helps you feel more in control and makes other people happy.", "NTA. Compassion is called for here, if she is depressed, and there are plenty of nice ways to tell someone to pick up their shit. ADHD can present challenges; they\u2019re not insurmountable. (As someone with ADHD.)\n\nHowever, she doesn\u2019t get to use that as a banner to destroy your living space, especially when she\u2019s living in your apartment. Then, she\u2019s hurting your mental health. (And physical health\u2014the food thing is a literal health hazard.) She needs to seek treatment, if it\u2019s that bad, and work out effective strategies for maintaining a minimum of cleanliness if she\u2019s not living alone.\n\nedit: modifying out a comment presuming op foots the whole bill.", "NTA. Having a clean living space is the bare minimum of living with someone. She needs to get treatment for her disorders and work on improving herself.", "NAH. Mental illness is complicated man. Depression is the cause of all of those things you\u2019re talking about. It can even cause issues with what is called executive function - in practice it\u2019s more helpful to think of depression as a disability than a mental illness, because depressed people straight up CAN\u2019T function, going well beyond not wanting to.\n\nWhat she\u2019s doing is not rooted in disrespect for you. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t absolve an individual from all personal accountability either. And they can bring the negative traits they had before they were depressed and they become amplified. How does one judge that?\n\nYou have a choice to accept her as she is and support her. You also have a choice not to. Neither would make you an asshole.", "NTA! I've been here.  I was exactly like the crappy girlfriend once upon a time, complete with TRMDD and ADHD.

She probably doesn't think it's much of a favor right now, but she *needs* to hear it.  I know each of us is different, so that's only my two cents based on my own experience in my own head. Results may vary, of course. Take what you'd like from this recovering former megaslob with the same conditions.", "I have bipolar and have been hospitalized.

And every single person I know who follows the rule does better mentally.\n\nEdit for judgment: nta", "ESH\n\nAs someone who once struggled with depression and has ADHD, I can definitely understand where you're gf is coming from. I think you're TA for some of the way you've written about her / depression here - in particular the \"using it as an excuse\" line.\n\nThat being said, it is on her to articulate what she needs/to do *something* about it. For me, I made a list of 3 things I was going to do each day and it kept me going. The house wasn't clean overnight, but it did stop things from getting out of hand for those I loved.\n\nThere is a light at the other end for both of you and I hope all works out.", "NTA and honestly, she's got self work to handle, before being a live in GF. This is not a healthy start for a life together.", "NTA. She may have depression, but that doesn't justify her disrespecting you and your home, and her apparently expecting you to be her butler.", "NAH\n\nHer mental illness makes what seems like simple tasks to you insurmountable tasks to her.\nBut she needs to understand that her mental illness does not mean she gets to disrespect her partner by making his living space unwelcoming and inhospitable for you!!!\nOver time this will lead to massive resentment between the 2 of you, her because she will feel overwhelmed and guilty all the time, and you because living in a dirty home sounds like a deal breaker for you.\n\nThink long and hard about the road forward, the cluter only gets worse with time and it may be that the 2 of you are just not compatible to be living together right now\n\nFor ADHD people with depression less is more.

Your girlfriend should be doing everything she can to get better because living like that is unhealthy, unsustainable and frankly vile. Especially as she doesn\u2019t own the place.", "NTA. I'm sure there are nicer ways to get her to be a considerate housemate (and support her mental health improvement), but I don't blame you for snapping. She's leaving all her mess on you. That's not acceptable. \n\nShe should be seeing a therapist and working on the issues.", "NTA, she can't excuse everything with ADHD and depression. Also, had she seen a specialist? Coz nowaday too many people self diagnose and weaponize their diagnosis to be excused from everything.\n\nHer being such a slob is taking a toll on YOUR mental health, it's time to have a serious talk with her and if no changes happen - ask her to find anohter living arrangement", "NTA.  She's a capable adult and shoud be held accountable.  And it would probably due her depression good if she got into a routine of such things and make her feel more responsible.  If she continues, you might consider cutting your losses.", "NTA. If she knows she has both of those things, she should be actively trying to seek out help with them. Is she on medication?

Living in a messy dump can also make symptoms of depression worse, I mean who wouldn\u2019t be unhappy living like that? \n\nWhenever I\u2019m having low moods I see the mess grow in my place as well. If I\u2019m in a bad place mentally I always make a \u201cdeal\u201d with myself so to say, and I tell myself I can do x if I only pick up and clean up 5 things. Then another 5 things, and another.. until the place is clean. Sometimes might take a short break in the middle if really struggling.", "NAH You both need to work on this together. \n\nFirst: You need to inform yourself about her case of depression the best you can. One known symptome is a problem with decission making and concentration. For you it might be a simple task, but your girlfriend might have trouble to start. Example: She changes clothes. The best way would be to open the wardrobe, get a hanger,  take clothes of and put them on the hanger, hang the hanger on the wardrobe to let the clothes air out. If the clothes are dirty put them in a laundry basket and sort them by wash load.\nThis does not happen, because your girlfriend does not have the concentration to get the steps. She takes her clothes of and does not know what to do next. They are in her hand and she cannot get the next steps in order. She cannot concentrate, she does not have the energy. She might get a little frightened and she starts having self doubt. This should be so easy. Why isn't it? Why is she such a failure? This costs extra energy. She now has even less. If she does not find a solution she might not change her clothes in the future at all and this would be even worse. She just puts it on the bed for the moment. Only until she feels better. She will remember the steps then. Repeat for 5 days and you habe a pile of clothing on the bed. \n\nIt is not laziness. It is about being completly overwelmed with a task. Even if she wanted to fix the problem this causes more problems. Doing laundry: is the washing maschine freely accessable? If she has to take washed laundry out and dry it, it is an extra step. If there is anything in the way, extra step. The laundry is not sorted by colors or fabric.  Maybe she needs to look into the pockets if there is trash or money. Is laundry detergent there? Even worse if you live in a community building with washers in the basement. Does she look okay? Does she need to shower? Does she need to get dressed?\nA simple task becomes a giant cloud of things that you cannot control and are not able to get in order. A simple task of 10 mins became a 2 hour task. You get the feeling that you can just not do it. If you are preassured by a partner it can get even worse  because now the intrusive thoughts start again. You are a failure, nobody can ever love you, he will leave her soon, because she cannot do basic things, etc. \n\nThere are technics to work around this and this is were your girlfriend needs to get to work. She needs therapy. A complete programm were she learns how to manage her day again. Adequate medications. Maybe a personal help to get her started. I don't know if your country does offer something like this or if you are able to afford it, but it can help a lot. \n\nYour girlfriend is not a slob on purpose or because she is lazy. She is struggling. At least she needs to try to get to a point were she is functioning. This will take years just to be clear. Getting better takes time and 3 steps forward can be followed by 2 steps back.", "NTA\n\n\nMy bf is very depressed, so now I help him wash his hair and I make food but he won't throw uneaten food under the bed and won't blame his illness for mess he tends to make.

My wife has depression and PTSD and acted just like your girlfriend for some time.\nBecaus of that I'd say ESH. \nI get that you are annoyed and want her to change those habits, but the way you talk about her and her problems are very disrespectfull. Try to be understanding and for example if you want her to clean something encurage her and help with it. Don't just push her to do it.\n\nOn the other hand your girlfriend needs therapy. It's good to know what the Problems are, but she has to do something to handle those.\nOnly that can realy help her and if she starts working on herself you two can slowly start to work on the actions that trouble you.", "YTA.\n\nInstead of being verbally abusive towards someone who is very clearly struggling, why not encourage them to, I don't know; GO TO THERAPY AND GET HELP???", ">she always responds with that she has depression & ADHD.

It's really about putting effort into those small things to start rebuilding herself.

Would she be able to stand on her own two feet? If not, then she needs to get into therapy or iop/cbt programs, yesterday. If she already is, they have not been going in the right direction and other options need to be explored, ASAP.", "NTA. You do need to take some time and learn how mental illness works and its symptoms. However if she has issues it\u2019s her responsibility to seek help and get better, she can\u2019t just trash your place and expect the world to accommodate her forever. Encourage her to find a therapist or look up other resources together maybe, if she refuses all the help I would break up.", "NTA but it sounds like she needs professional help. you could\u2019ve been nicer about it as you mentioned, but there\u2019s a breaking point when someone is blatantly disrespecting your home. depression and ADHD are explanations, not excuses", "NTA.\n\nMost people in my family have major depression, but they can still act like adults and tidy the fuck up.\n\nYes it's hard, but life isn't just about doing the easy stuff.", "Ooh, this is a difficult one.

Living with her as been a little bit of a struggle because she's a very messy person. She leaves her clothes everywhere on the floor & on the bed. Can't be bothered to fold or hang up her clothes in the closet. I swear she uses our bed as a closet. She sometimes brings food into the room & doesn't throw it away. even worse she sometimes puts the garbage under the bed so I don't complain about it. \n\nI don't even want to get started on what the bathroom looks like, I had to start using the guest bathroom\n\nI understand that having depression can make it harder for someone to take care of themselves & their environment. But I feel like there is a limit to where you're just using it as an excuse to just do whatever & not care . Especially when you're living in someone's else home. \n\nI keep telling her to clean up after herself & that I'm tired of cleaning up after a grown woman & she always responds with that she has depression & ADHD. Which I don't see how that's an excuse. You have depression, sure. How does that make you leave garbage everywhere & be a slob? I don't get it. You're an adult. Act like it. \n\nShe got angry & accused me of not giving a fuck about what she is going through & called be an  Unsympathetic  moron. Apparently I'm not being supportive & understanding of her mental health because I have a problem with her treating my house like it's a garbage dump. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like I was overly harsh because I probably could've addressed this issue in a friendlier way, but after many attempts of trying to get her to be more clean & pick up after herself, I just had enough.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She might be annoyed but it is probably what she needs. The hard thing for her can be to know where to start. If the mess is already huge she might be very overwhelmed, you need to tell her where to start. It might be too much for you to handle being with her, but if you want to give it a shot I think this is the way", "NTA. It's absolutely true that depression and ADHD make cleaning very hard. But there's a limit. One thing that feels like a red flag is that you haven't mentioned any days where she feels ok and starts to look after herself.

I\u2019m of the opinion that if you want things done a certain way, you\u2019ll have to do it that way. It\u2019s not fair for you to expect others to live up to your expectations of cleanliness. I came to this conclusion because I am the clean one and it was just easier to accept that others have different standards. \n\nDepression sucks and can make it hard to do things. But you can\u2019t motivate her to change her habits with your current approach. And honestly, it may just be her way of living.\n\nAlso, when you first move out on your own and you don\u2019t have your parents on your case to do chores, lots of people simply exercise their right to not do them. She may just need some time to grow up. Living in clutter and filth gets old after a while. She\u2019s probably also overwhelmed by the process of cleaning up. Sometimes it helps to break the process down into little steps. She might need encouragement and direction. Like, tell her to first separate clean clothes from dirty clothes. When that\u2019s done, tell her to put the dirty clothes in the washer. Now, while that\u2019s running, put the clean clothes away. Then, rotate laundry. Now, pick up all the dishes around the house and put them in the sink. Now it\u2019s time to fold laundry. That\u2019s enough for today, tomorrow we\u2019ll tackle the bathroom. \n\nHowever, you may want to reevaluate your relationship. We can\u2019t help the way we feel.

Yes, the task is simple, she has the physical skills it takes to take the trash, get up, walk to the bin, throw the things in there and walk back.\n\nIt's not that easy though. What happens a lot when someone has ADHD is that the brain actually blocks you from doing that. You know you have to do it, you know it's simple and you know that everyone can do it. But you just can't. For some reason you can't bring yourself to get up and do it. Combine that with depression and it gets even worse.\n\n\nAnd trust me, the last thing a person in her situation needs is criticism. Because they already criticise themselves more than anyone else ever could. They know they have to change. And theu want to change.

I'm not saying he should allow this to continue.\n\nI'm saying the best thing for him to do is either educate himself on her conditions and learn how he can best help her, but then he needs to know and accept that it will probably take years for her to change, and she might struggle with it for her whole life.\n\nOr he should get out of that situation, by not letting her live with him any longer, because he needs to take care of himself before anyone else and if it affects his mental health, they will both continue to get worse.\nAnd honestly, from what I've read, I think it's better for OP to choose the second option.", "No probably not however she hasn\u2019t been living with her parents for a while. yet what gives her the right to act like a slob, NOTHING.

It\u2019s understandable why living this way feels unhealthy to you and why want a clean home. But, something I feel some people on this thread aren\u2019t understanding is that if your depression is severe enough, you sometimes literally can\u2019t just \u201ctry to do better.\u201d It\u2019s not like she has the energy to clean up and then doesn\u2019t, and goes out partying instead. \n\nYou know that feeling when you\u2019re really sick? Like say, a bad flu. There\u2019s no energy in your muscles, you\u2019re extremely fatigued all the time; maybe you don\u2019t even have the energy to feed yourself sometimes. Depression can have tangible physical symptoms too. And on top of that, there is a block in your brain whenever you think about doing something productive, making you feel like you can\u2019t do it. Cleaning can seem extremely overwhelming (mentally).\n\nIt\u2019s possible some people with depression can somehow push through it but others can\u2019t. For people saying \u201cdepression doesn\u2019t give her an excuse to be this way\u201d, if a friend of yours had a broken arm would you say the same thing? \u201cJust because her arm is broken doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t clean.\u201d It kind of does mean that, at least for some. \n\nAll that being said- she was out of line for insulting you, and I think she should try to see where you\u2019re coming from. If you can\u2019t live like this though that\u2019s understandable. Everyone has different limits.", "NAH for how you feel. However, you are for what you said to her. Yes she also said some terrible things to you, but what you said to her was very narrow-minded and misinformed, and using someone's mental health as a weapon against them or to shove blame for them is not okay, even if she is also not in the right, and the situation is not fair for either of you.\n\nI agree with what a lot of other people have said here. With depression and ADHD (as well as a few other unfortunates), I live with an almost identical situation. Have you heard of spoon theory? I highly suggest looking into it. Obviously I do not know everything about her situation, but spoon theory is a great way to explain what has been my biggest issue regarding this. At first, my husband also really struggled with the situation, and obviously I have gone through waves of being more or less helpful, and have a very good psychiatric/therapy team that has helped a ton, but during particularly bad times, he knows relationships are not always going to be equal, it is about figuring out what works for you. \n\nWith that being said, just because we have figured it out does not mean you have to. You need to think realistically about what you want/where you see this relationship going, and if it is worth it to you, sit down with her and see if there is some sort of agreement you can reach NOT in the heat of the moment, because that just makes everyone defensive and rarely leads to a productive conversation. Her not seeking treatment may be a bigger issue for you, and may make this a harder issue to resolve. If she is not willing to even consider trying to make this better, and not just for your sake but hers too, it may be time to reconsider the relationship. \n\nTL;DR: Basically while she also should not be shamed for her mental health, you also are not less of a person for deciding this is not something you can or want to handle (as long as you aren't rude about it). Also I recommend looking up spoon theory.", "Soft ESH\n\nAs another person who has ADHD and has had depression who's now a stay at home dad.. I understand both sides' struggles. I struggle to maintain the home to the level my wife expects and she struggles to understand that my energy comes in waves.\n\nYou're right that it's not an excuse but you're wrong if you think it'll change quickly just because you ask or expect. Normally people can think \"I'll do this thing\" and then go do it. With ADHD, that executive function doesn't work well.\n\nIt's all about baby steps. If you want her to improve you're going to need a lot of patience and effort; and to not judge her by results but by effort. Ask one, minute thing at a time. Maybe first thing is to stop bringing in food. Maybe the next is you each, once a day, together (it's easier together for ADHD, then to initiate alone) being one thing out of the room. After a few weeks, two things. After a few weeks wash the sheets (together) every couple weeks, etc. And she will have times where it's too much and you'll have to restart it start over. This is key. It's more reinforcing to restart a habit then to do it and never stop. Again, it's about effort, not results.\n\nIf that's too much, it's understandable. That's your call to make.

Medication can help because it pushes down a bit of the physical issues. There are a ton of resources out there. Maybe start by both of you watching something like this talk from KC Davis who helped me work out good strategies for care tasks: [How to do laundry when you're depressed](https://youtu.be/M1O_MjMRkPg).

Yes, it's reasonable to not want a dumpster for a home. She has two **disabilities** (while mental, yes, they are considered disabilities) that actively prevent her from doing what she needs to. It was indeed unsympathetic to assume that she's like this because she wants to be. \n\n However, you did mention in another comment that she's not being treated and is wholly unmedicated, which is where her main issue lies. Both depression and ADHD can cause executive dysfunction, where she literally cannot force herself to do important things. People with this issue can struggle with basic tasks, such as chores, personal hygiene, even remembering to eat and drink.  Medication and therapy will at least do something for that. When she finds the right dose and coping mechanisms, things will clear up.\n\nETA: Very sudden afterthought, but some people with ADHD can sometimes accomplish tasks better by \"body doubling\". Basically, all you need to do is be there to help motivate during the task. You may or may not need to help and clean alongside her, considering the depression, but it may help her mentally manage to do the task if you're physically there.

For some, their ADHD is disabling when it comes to accessing education or work.\n\nJust like autism, it's a wide spectrum of experiences and ADHD's often a comorbid diagnosis with depression and anxiety.\nMost ADHD people I've talked to personally link their mental health issues to experiencing severe bullying or abuse in childhood because they were \"different\".\n\nSo no, ADHD adults aren't just lazy or whatever when they struggle to keep up with chores. The struggle is real, and it's an indication that they need new tools and coping mechanisms to overcome it.\n\nTHAT ALL BEING SAID, you have the right to expect your partner will respect shared spaces by keeping them tidy.

If you're serious about this relationship, you're going to have to be a little patient, but I don't think it does you or your girlfriend any good to pretend she's not capable of improvement. There will be coping mechanisms that work for her, and there will be communication strategies that allow her to articulate what she needs rather than calling you names when you get frustrated with her. \n\nEqually, sometimes bad mental health can put someone in a place where they're just not able to to be in a relationship.

No? Well then, you just need to smile more and try harder. Have you tried running? Being sad isn\u2019t an excuse to keep cancelling plans with me. Also, your house is disgusting and your hair is greasy. You\u2019d do better if you stopped making fake excuses for being a slob. Of course I don\u2019t believe you.

No one ever explicitly came out to say they don\u2019t believe me *because* I wasn\u2019t officially diagnosed, but they didn\u2019t have to. That stance/opinion directly results in denial & invalidation at pivotal points in someone\u2019s own internal acceptance that they do seriously need help. Telling people is the first step. Being invalidated/dismissed discourages many of us from moving to the next step & seeking formal diagnosis because maybe we\u2019re just crazy, bad people, it\u2019s all in our heads.

It's only been a few months it makes sense that, if she does have depression, this is all a part of it. With all the context given, it's more than likely that this is all her struggling with depression. The conclusion that she's faking it unless she has a diagnosis is dismissive and not helpful.

I solved this by putting hampers everywhere. If she struggles to put clean clothes away, get drawer inserts or bins so she can just throw her clean clothes somewhere with little effort.

She might do odd things like put the garbage NEXT to the can (ADHD will get distracted and drop a task halfway through) but if you prompt her to put it away, she\u2019ll apologize and take care of it. \n\nPeople with ADHD tend to have a weird NO or anger reaction when told to do something, so if on the planned cleaning day, she resists a bit, gently remind her that this is important and you will help. If she\u2019s mad/annoyed but fully participates, let her have her emotional moment. People with ADHD have trouble self-soothing or we over-react, so let her have her shitty moment in private *as long as she does not take it out on you*. \n\nIf she can make the effort, that\u2019s a great sign. \n\nHOWEVER. If she fights you on every point, refuses to participate in cleaning or problem solving, shuts down communication, weaponizes incompetence, or deliberately becomes messier? She\u2019s an asshole.

If she participates, then that shows she WANTS to be better but couldn\u2019t figure out HOW.

If she can\u2019t afford treatment, it\u2019s truly unfortunate but OP isn\u2019t obligated to put up with conditions resulting from her untreated mental illnesses.", "My daughter has Autism and ADHD and yet they learned to pick up after themselves because I won't let them not do it. Sure, sometimes I have to help, give her one direction at a time. We keep a trash can in her room, every night before bed when we get ready I stand in her room and say pick this up, hand it to me, pick this up, throw it in the trash, put this in this chest, then I hand her the pile of dishes that goes to the sink and tell her to put it there, but slowly each day she does more and more of it on her own as she finishes the food or drink etc. it's a process, but they can do it, if you are patient and they are WILLING. It helps she is still a minor and lives at home so I can still pull the parent card tho. I am def not denying that.\n\nEdited typo", "It isn't a flex if it benefits yourself and/or others.

She's a grown ass woman, and if she can't get her shit together she should not be in a relationship, burdening other people with her issues. It's not his role to be her therapist.", "Shouldn't they be??", "Well its a good thing that I\u2019m not American, and OP never said they where either. However i do feel very bad for any American who does suffer and can\u2019t get help. It generally 50/50 in the UK but i know its a lot worse over there.", "Im not saying it can\u2019t be true, it know very well i can be true. Im saying that constantly using Self diagnosis as a constant excuse is unfair for the both of them.", "Not only that but it can take months and months to get an appointment with a psychiatrist if she *has* insurance and the money for copays.", "YTA\n\nDo ANY research on ADHD especially in women, in adult women. \n\nyou don't have to look very far at all  (for example [https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/)) \n\nThese are not excuses SYMPTOMS!!!!!

Sometimes I need these gentle reminders that I'm doing alright. My clothes pile isn't the actual end of the world, but to some people feel it is. I'm doing my best. I'm not an asshole for it.", "You're amazing for taking the time to give this great answer", "Thank you for some input and advice from someone who *actually* understands ADHD, and that ADHD is an executive functioning disorder. This thread is utterly exhausting. So many neurotypical people weighing in on a topic they simply don't understand, calling a mentally ill and neurodivergent person a slob, a filthy pig, a child and a toddler for something she's probably already berating herself heavily about already, hence being frozen in a state of being immobilized by guilt and overwhelm. I tried to explain it in another comment with the cup theory. OPs girlfriend needs a full cup in order to be able to fill other cups, such as caring for her mental health and cleaning the home. Every time she's berated for her behaviours, she feels immense guilt and her cup is emptied. Every time she's reminded of the huge pile of mess that her bedroom is, she feels immense guilt and her cup is emptied. She knows more than anyone that she NEEDS to get help for her mental health and that she needs to tidy and clean around the home, and she knows a clean home will benefit her mental health, but she simply doesn't have a full cup in order to fill those cups with. If, instead of berating OPs girlfriend and calling her a slob and childish, OP instead offers her love, understanding, empathy and help, her cup will be allowed to fill and she'll start to be able to fill other cups from her cup, like doing dishes, doing the laundry etc which will in turn help subside the guilt from not doing any chores, which allows the cup to fill up a little bit more, until eventually her cup is full and she can go and get help for her mental health. People in this thread are like her inner voice, saying all the worst things she feels about herself. It's so sad. \n\nAnd thank you for actually offering some realistic advice. I doubt OP wants advice though. To me, the most telling part of the entire post is that OP posted it here, on /r/AITA, seeking validation for himself, rather than posting somewhere like [/r/relationshipadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice), [/r/ADHD_partners](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_partners), [/r/ADHDdating](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDdating), [/r/depression_partners](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_partners), [/r/ADHD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD), [/r/depression_help](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help), [/r/neurodiversity](https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity) where he could focus on HELPING his girlfriend rather than berating her. It doesn't seem his priority is getting his girlfriend help, it's being right.", "Oh my god, I\u2019m gonna start doing this, THANK YOU.", "This. NTA, OP. If you can work with her to compromise (garbage can by the bed, hamper in a convenient olace), that\u2019s great. If not, you may want to rethink living with her unless you want to live this way forever. I feel bad for her, but it\u2019s on her to get the help she needs and manage her condition. You aren\u2019t her housekeeper.", "Yeah I have depression and ADHD. I might leave the sink full of dirty dishes and take an occasional plate to a bedroom but it goes to the kitchen the next day.", "Thank you so much for your reply - I didn't know how much I needed to hear this. It made me tear up", "Have you brought it up before? Is she resistant to receiving treatment?", "I once had a family closet next to the laundry. It was life changing. I wish I had that again.", "See also carmoire and chairdrobe.", "Honestly my place is too small and the building too old to have a dedicated laundry room, and the previous owners put the stacked washer/dryer in one of the two closets. It's amazing. I thought I'd hate having all the machine noise where I sleep, but that turned out to be a non-issue. Instead when I switch loads, clean dry clothes get chucked on my bed so that I have to fold it and put it away in order to sleep.", "Not everything's great. But when it comes to ressources for mental and physical health, it's very good.", "She's not in therapy or meds. She's just.....not doing anything. That's unacceptable when she's making his life hell.", "So, it's cool for her to trash his house? You're making excuses for her that she hasn't even made for herself.", "I've never thought about it before but now that I am, all the things I want in my future house if I ever get one, are things that would make managing my adhd messes easier lol. For me it would be the setup where the washer and dryer are in the bathroom.", "If it's any consolation, the UK has a socialised national health service but treatment for learning disabilities and for mental health treatments are ridiculously underfunded. I'm on a TWO year waiting list for an ADD diagnosis and a 12 month waiting list for therapy. As far as I'm aware we don't have any programmes like Spitex, I have to pay privately for an enabler to come in, clean and organise my home. I get extra care via Social Services, but again, I have to pay towards that, too.", "Again, no.  I have been through the self hate of depression and have let my house get messy.  I get that, understand it, support getting help for that.  She is actively working against that by hiding her mess under the bed.  That is her acknowledging a problem and hiding it from him to get away with it.  She knows it\u2019s a problem for him and instead of trying to make it better she hides it.  It\u2019s like an addict hiding their addiction.  You are completely ignoring that and making her a victim of her depression when she is actively making it worse.", "Seriously.  Also they need to bring back those little food service elevator thingeys, it would make taking stuff up and down stairs much more likely to get done!  A friend of mine growing up had a laundry chute in her room that went down into the laundry room too!", "I think it is prescribed by your local psychiatrist/ doctor.\n\nhttps://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulante_psychiatrische_Pflege", "Not everyone is the same. For my daughter, it's a crippling fear of pissing people off even though we are patient and understanding. So she hides things but is very aware of it and has a great deal of trouble overriding this. We've talked about it just last week again. She opened up and explained that somewhere in her brain she desperately wants to do the right things and knows what they all are. But she's got nearly zero executive function, it's single digit. That meets the severe depression and anxiety and cripples her, even though she desperately wants to do well. No one wants this for themselves, and for some, regardless of how it is for others, this is just the way it is. That's why I'm saying he needs to decide if he wants to be her team mate in navigating it, or save himself. Either way isn't wrong. But if he stays and thinks it'll get better by making her feel worse, he will be only hurting them both.", "You are equating your daughters issues with op\u2019s girlfriend.  If someone\u2019s mental ill ease affects another person negatively, harming their mental wellness, it is abuse.   He needs to decide if he wants to put up with the abuse or not to.  Mental illness is not an excuse at all!", "Yeah, I agree. OP shouldn't have to spend his time cleaning up after someone else and living in filth. However OP didn't have to call his mentally ill girlfriend a slob and berate her.", "Agreed. I don\u2019t think he picked a good approach but it\u2019s difficult having to live in constant mess. I also have depression and ADHD and sometimes I look at my room and think \u201cyou are a disgusting mess\u201d.", "One thing that I find helpful (if I remember it) is the phrase - don't put it down, put it away. When everything has it's place, it's easier to keep things clean if you just put them in that place immediately (repeating the phrase for added motivation).", "Seeking help for mental illness is not an easy thing.  I struggle with depression and anxiety, it took me a long time before I was able to go to a doctor, because my anxiety told me the doctor was going to judge me, and I felt like I was \"defective\" for having depression,  I felt beyond help and that I would be better off if I just curled up in a ball and died. Comments like yours (Calling the GF an AH because she hasn't seemed help yet), shows you have no knowledge of the true struggle behind mental health Illnesses, so you judging the GF makes you an AH.", "This is the advice that saves people from themselves lol, stop trying to make everything work in your house like you think it should and pay attention to how/where you use things - a game changer. I also made buckets for each room with all the cleaning supplies and on the bucket it has a sharpie list of everything needed and the room it goes with, so then you grab that, have the list of tasks and the list of supplies - anybody could come in and clean my house this way, once I tell them where that stuff is.", "This. There is always a little pile of garbage somewhere? Then a trash can probably belongs there.", "Yes if it is picked up and keeping your house in a cleaner state than it would normally be then it isn't a wrong way to do it.

Dirty clothes go in a hamper, but most of the time clean clothes live on the floor. I live alone and I genuinely do not care (and have ADHD/depression so maybe I lack the energy to care). It works, I know where the clean clothes are, why change?", "So did she diagnose herself with depression and ADHD, or did she get the diagnosis and then cease care?", "Just looked at a house yesterday that has a washer/dryer hookup in the master closet.

I can imagine it was a great help.", "Have you looked into online/telehealth as an option? I\u2019ve never had to visit a doctor or psychiatrist in person for my diagnosis. Also, as an adult, it\u2019s much easier to get a diagnosis and treatment than as a child where they may put you through different cognitive exams. I was told by my 3 different telehealth psychs now that for adults it\u2019s more do you have these symptoms and are these symptoms impacting your life.\n\nEdit - I\u2019m in the US and this likely isn\u2019t the case everywhere else.", "I loved having this setup in an apartment with a stackable washer/dryer.

I should\u2019ve qualified my statement that at least where I\u2019m at (US based) they allow telehealth.\n\nHopefully you don\u2019t have to jump through too many more hoops to get treatment. It\u2019s been honestly life changing for me. Really made my early struggles in life make so much more sense (my parents were never believers on ADD/ADHD and so wouldn\u2019t get me tested ever as a kid)."]}
