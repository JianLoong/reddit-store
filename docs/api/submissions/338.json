Recently I\u2019ve been wanting to dye my hair but want it professionally done which I\u2019ve never done, so it comes out the way i want it. i also have been wanting a hair at a salon, i usually cut my own and haven\u2019t been to a salon for a hair cut since middle school. All of this is a little pricey to me and i view as a huge luxury. I was looking up salons around me and appointment times and the only one that seem to work out for me was on Friday which happens to be my birthday. I went back and forth on this for an hour and finally convinced myself that i deserve this. Before i made the appointment i doubled checked with my mom to see if she can watch my son while i go which would be about 3 hours. She response was very unexpected. She reminded me there\u2019s a possibility that her work could call her for over time(she works M-F for three hours a day) and she wasn\u2019t gonna decline for me. Then she remembered she has that Thursday and Friday off giving her a for day weekend, but she looked at me real serious and started saying it was her day off and kept repeating that to me. She then said i need to be scheduling that kind of stuff for the weekend. The salon i was gonna book at has no weekend openings till mid December and i wanted it for my birthday. When i told her that she just looked at me and again said it was her day off and i need to schedule stuff like this for the weekend. She just treated me like i was being totally inconsiderate and like i do this often but i don\u2019t especially not her but i did this time because she\u2019s my only option. I feel extremely bummed because i never get pampered, i don\u2019t get my nails done or get pedicures or anything like plus I\u2019ve had a hell of a past 16 months. Never find myself deserving or being able to afford this kind of thing and this one time i can afford and convinced myself I\u2019m deserving this time. I really can\u2019t let this situation go and keep thinking about and I\u2019m starting to second guess if i did something wrong by asking", "created_utc": 1667248996, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiod3h/aita_for_asking_my_mom_to_babysit_my_son/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has the right over her time. I'm not saying you shouldn't get pampered, we all need to treat ourselves from time to time, but you aren't entitled to free babysitting because you want it.", "Hire a babysitter. Your mom doesn't want to give up her day off n she shouldn't have to\n\nYTA\n\nWould have said N A H but the tone of the whole post is a \"pity me\" one n that contradicts you saying you don't expect ayone to owe you childcare.", "YTA for not accepting your mom's answer. It was fine to ask, but once she said no, she meant no.", "You\u2019re not the ah for asking. You are for not accepting no as an answer though. It has nothing to do with deserving it. You do, you just have to do it when you have child care.\nSoftly, YTA", "NAH unless you continue to pressure her at this point. It\u2019s okay to ask, but when someone declines it\u2019s time to let it go.", "NAH - You are not an AH for asking but your mom is also not an AH for being unavailable. Maybe you could find someone else to babysit. I hope this works out for you :/", "NAH mom isn\u2019t your personal babysitter even when it\u2019s something you deserve. There are actual babysitters tho", "YTA.  Not for asking - asking is fine, but for not accepting her answer of no.  No one owes you babysitting.  Join some local mom's groups and get the names of recommended babysitters.", "NAH. She can decline, you can be bummed.\n\nWhat\u2019s shocking me here are all the commentators saying \u201cjust get a babysitter and go to the salon.\u201d None of these replies seem to be coming from people who have ANY IDEA how much a good, reputable babysitter costs. There were plenty of nights I couldn\u2019t go to dinner and a movie with my S.O. because the babysitter would\u2019ve cost MORE than dinner and a movie for two. \n\nTake care of yourself, OP. Try to make friends with other moms who are willing to swap child care. Or wait for your mom, if necessary. I take it the dad is not in the picture.", "Based on OP's comments, I'll edit my judgment to a soft YTA. This is not for asking your mom to babysit, but for saying her \"response was very unexpected\"--this means you assumed she would say yes, and you're here posting because you're mad that she didn't. I think by pushing you to schedule it for the weekend, mom was suggesting that this long appointment be scheduled for when your son's father can watch him, rather than cut into your mom's own time off.  I get that you want to treat yourself to this new look--you should--but your mom's entitled to treat herself to whatever she wants on her days off as well, not spend that valuable time chasing around a toddler.  \n\nOriginal Question: why is your mom saying you \"need to schedule stuff like this for the weekend\"? Is it because your SO is home then to watch the child?", "You\u2019re not TA for asking, but why does this birthday treat have to be on your actual birthday if it means that she is losing out on work/can\u2019t decline? There\u2019s still time to book this as your birthday treat on a different day and still have your mother babysit.  \n\nIf it means so much to you to have this hair dye on your birthday, you will need to factor in the cost of paying a babysitter who can guarantee her time and services.", "**NTA** \n\nI think your mother could have babysat her own grandchild on her  daughter\u2019s birthday so that you could have a break and pamper yourself.   \n\nYou are **NTA** for asking her and being disappointed in het refusal.", "NAH There is not a single bad person in that story. Everybody is just doing the best they can.", "There is nothing wrong with asking, but she has said no. It doesn't matter how much you think you deserve pampering or how rarely you make such a request. She doesn't have to grant you this favor. Hire a babysitter or don't go. YTA", "NAH, You wanted to do something for your birthday, But your mother didn't want to watch your son. the only other avenue would be for you to find an alternate sitter for those three hours.", "Info - is your question AITA because you asked, or AITA for expecting a different answer from Grandma? The title implies the former, but the content implies the latter.", "NAH. It's fine to ask. But you can't expect everyone to say yes.", "NTA for asking, but your mother isn't required to babysit. It sucks, but seems like she's not interested in that type of relationship with him. I'd see if you can find someone for a few hours and pay them. You do absolutely deserve to treat yourself!", "YTA. It was fine for you to ask and it was fine for her to decline, but not ok for you to keep pushing her to change her mind. She is not obligated to spend her days off caring for your child. You do deserve the occasional bit of pampering (everyone does) but it isn\u2019t fair to expect her to provide you with free childcare for that. You might need to include the cost of paid childcare into the budget when you do want some pampering.", "I never kept pushing i started to ask and she cut me off to say all that and i didn\u2019t interrupt her while she was talking, i was quite the whole time and just said okay at the end", "NTA. \n\nThere are a lot of people who would say that your mom isn't obligated to watch your son, but what she's doing is kind of manipulative in its own way. She isn't saying no to watching him, but is guilt-tripping you about asking her to watch him on her 'day off', and before that kept using work calling her in as something to hang over your head. \n\nI'd recommend finding someone else to watch him in general, sounds like your mom is too immature to just say no instead of dropping heavy-handed-hints.", "NAH, but do you have any friends that you could do a babysitting swap with?  Like they watch your kid for a bit, then when they need a sitter you help them?  That way mom doesn't have to be burdened with your child \\*snarkasm\\*", "NTA - when your parents live nearby, it's normal to ask them to watch the kids for you periodically.  And typically, they want to because it's an opportunity to spend time with their grandchildren.  \n\nIn this case, find a babysitter and go get your hair done.  It's great to have a babysitter that you can trust, so definitely try to find one.  Social media groups can help with that if you don't know where to find one.", "NTA for your feelings.  Contact some local drop in daycares.", "NTA for asking, and your mom had every right to decline if she didn't want to watch her grandson. That said, it appears your mother is not interested in maintaining a close relationship with her grandchild(ren), so you should be taking that into account for anything you wish to do in the future. If you can find another sitter, or a daycare that will allow you to bring your sine in for several hours, go ahead and treat yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are totally fine for asking her to do this favour for you. She could've said no straight up instead of playing mind games, and that's on her, not your fault at all!"]}
