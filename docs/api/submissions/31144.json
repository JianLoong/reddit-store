Yes, we spend a lot on our vehicles, but it\u2019s inevitable that vehicles WILL get scratches & dents. They just will. Nothing will prevent this from happening; unless we have some protective bubble around the vehicle. \nWe try to hard to keeping material objects up to par to make others think we\u2019re amazing because we have them, when in all honesty, people just don\u2019t care nor bat an eye at it. If anything; they\u2019ll say \u201ccool such-and-such\u201d and never think about it again. It\u2019s forgotten. \n\nAnd I get wanting to keep nice things. That\u2019s fine. We like nice & clean things, but in my opinion, again, there are bigger fish to fry. So many things to stress over in life, a dent or scratch on a car isn\u2019t one of them, neither is a significant other trying to do their best to make me happy. I honestly would\u2019ve thought the fuck-up would\u2019ve been funny. Something to laugh at later. I\u2019m sure she felt ridiculous. I mean, we\u2019re human. And it\u2019s a vehicle without a heartbeat. A person is worth way more than a vehicle. \nI\u2019ve come close to death a few times to now know that human life means way more to me than anything. The people that I love means more to me than anything. I\u2019ll sacrifice anything for them. Their happiness and well-being is more important to me than any material object. After all, when we\u2019re on our death bed, all we\u2019re going to want around us are those we love & who love us, not our material objects. \n\nOn that note, I\u2019ve witnessed a few passings of a few people where no one had anything nice to say about them. As a matter of fact, people didn\u2019t really care, nor did they want to show-up to show any respect because they had no respect. These were people who didn\u2019t cherish those around them. They only cherished what THEY wanted. That\u2019s no legacy. And without a legacy, you\u2019re nothing. \n\nYes, I went deep with my explanation. I just wanted to be clear with my answer for when I said, yea, I think you were pretty harsh. And if you do feel THAT deeply upset; then maybe you should think about how much that person truly does matter to you. Maybe she isn\u2019t the right person for you, If you don\u2019t consider her more valuable than your vehicle that will be out of date in a few years & won\u2019t be worth much anyway. After all, vehicle come & go & lose value as time goes on. The paint is even more worthless than the model of the vehicle.", "YTA.  You have a $16,000 car worth $10,000 and soon no girlfriend.
