It is what it is, I'm a carpenter and I'm pretty handy. Today, while she was borrowing my car for work she took it upon herself to wipe off the peeling paint and paint over it with acrylic black.. I have a Jeep grand Cherokee with its own paint code. Via txt she told me she was doing to do this and I asked her twice if she had the oem correct paint. She bought acrylic black paint at Marshall's and painted the dent. Like wtf now I need to buff that off, remove the dent, prime the area twice, and put 2-3 coats of oem paint on it, than clear coat. She never answered my question about the paint and I never told her I was okay with her doing it. Now I'm fucking pissed. I pay slot of money for my vehicle and it's not hers to make decisions that affect it. The paint DOESNT EVEN MATCH. she's now not talking to me for right now bc I'm an asshole for getting mad. When she disregarded what I said and made more repair work for me. I just feel like even though she\n\"tried\" to do the right thing she could've answered my questions and we could have done it together.

You don\u2019t have to be emotionally responsible for someone else\u2019s incompetence. There was absolutely no reason for her to take this upon herself and it doesn\u2019t make any sense why she thought putting acrylic paint on a car would work. Is it just like out of a tube from the craft store? I really hope she didn\u2019t use wall paint. If it\u2019s from a tube you can probably just let it flake off or gently scratch it off with your fingernail. It doesn\u2019t stay on metal very well", "NTA, I know she wanted to help but like you said, she could have answered your questions and not ignored you. Also, who the hell uses acrylic paint for a car!?!? You legit don\u2019t have to know much about cars to know that. She should apologize and y\u2019all can just move on.", "NTA.

Who does arts and crafts on someone else's $35,000 property ?", "NTA one should never \u2018fix\u2019 someone else\u2019s car. Everything for a grand Cherokee is horrendously expensive.

Intentions aside, she assumed she knew what she was doing and absolutely did not.

Sometimes in relationships you can either choose to be happy or right\u2026in this instance it doesn\u2019t appear you can be both.", "She probably didn\u2019t answer the question because she probably thought it would come out looking OK. \nShe was most probably trying to do something nice. \n\nI\u2019m a little older, and I\u2019ve learned in life that there are bigger fish to fry. Yes, we spend a lot on our vehicles, but it\u2019s inevitable that vehicles WILL get scratches & dents. They just will. Nothing will prevent this from happening; unless we have some protective bubble around the vehicle. \nWe try to hard to keeping material objects up to par to make others think we\u2019re amazing because we have them, when in all honesty, people just don\u2019t care nor bat an eye at it. If anything; they\u2019ll say \u201ccool such-and-such\u201d and never think about it again. It\u2019s forgotten. \n\nAnd I get wanting to keep nice things. That\u2019s fine. We like nice & clean things, but in my opinion, again, there are bigger fish to fry. So many things to stress over in life, a dent or scratch on a car isn\u2019t one of them, neither is a significant other trying to do their best to make me happy. I honestly would\u2019ve thought the fuck-up would\u2019ve been funny. Something to laugh at later. I\u2019m sure she felt ridiculous. I mean, we\u2019re human. And it\u2019s a vehicle without a heartbeat. A person is worth way more than a vehicle. \nI\u2019ve come close to death a few times to now know that human life means way more to me than anything. The people that I love means more to me than anything. I\u2019ll sacrifice anything for them. Their happiness and well-being is more important to me than any material object. After all, when we\u2019re on our death bed, all we\u2019re going to want around us are those we love & who love us, not our material objects. \n\nOn that note, I\u2019ve witnessed a few passings of a few people where no one had anything nice to say about them. As a matter of fact, people didn\u2019t really care, nor did they want to show-up to show any respect because they had no respect. These were people who didn\u2019t cherish those around them. They only cherished what THEY wanted. That\u2019s no legacy. And without a legacy, you\u2019re nothing. \n\nYes, I went deep with my explanation. I just wanted to be clear with my answer for when I said, yea, I think you were pretty harsh. And if you do feel THAT deeply upset; then maybe you should think about how much that person truly does matter to you. Maybe she isn\u2019t the right person for you, If you don\u2019t consider her more valuable than your vehicle that will be out of date in a few years & won\u2019t be worth much anyway. After all, vehicle come & go & lose value as time goes on. The paint is even more worthless than the model of the vehicle.", "YTA.  You have a $16,000 car worth $10,000 and soon no girlfriend.
