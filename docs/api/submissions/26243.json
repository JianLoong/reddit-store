He knew that was inappropriate. Perhaps it was a passive aggressive attempt to get back at you for forcing him to be in the photo. I think his behavior is pretty outrageous\n\nNTA", "And this is why people have the much ridiculed selfie sticks, so they can take photos of themselves-and themselves *with others*, because nobody else, (I\u2019m looking at your husband), can be arsed to do it. \n\nNTA and your husband doesn\u2019t have to \u201cunderstand\u201d why you want to have a nice family photo. He should go along with it and try to be appropriate - because it is important to you. What you wanted was harmless and really pretty common, and nice. \n\nNTA and now he gets to be memorialized in his band t-shirt. While, it sounds like, the rest of you looked cleaned up and nice. Yay. :(", "NTA. He\u2019s trying to pass off bare minimum as maximum effort, and you should be so lucky. \n\nI\u2019m willing to bet on the fact that this process of his also counts towards other instances in your relationship.", "NTA he absolutely did this on purpose. Why are you married to someone who cares so little about you? Also this tactic was incredibly manipulative. No one \u2018really takes photos\u2019 except professional photographers which most of us aren\u2019t. Your husband is absolutely capable of snapping a few family pictures here and there cause he knows it\u2019s important to you. \n\nHis disdain for you is a lot", "Is he me when I was 14? NTA. My ex was like this. Zero effort, drives me insane", "You should have just asked him to leave, taken nice photos with your kids and hang them up all over the house. NTA but if he doesn\u2019t want to be in the photos just let him not be.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't asking him to sit still while you get a 16 hour renaissance painting made.  It's a nice, family portrait.", "that\u2019s such a pain, at the end of the day he will have so many photo memories that you captured when you\u2019ll only have this photoshoot. it\u2019s hard for me to understand why it was not obvious for him, it\u2019s a simple logic.. ewww such an ick", "NTA - think it's a dick move on his part. It's a simple ask to dress a bit nicer when you had booked in the photoshoot in advance. Definitely not an unreasonable request", "NTA at all. So many moms are in the same boat. I take so many great pictures of my husband and my daughter but he never takes any of me (if he does, they are terrible). So for most moms, these family pics are the only nice pictures with our kids that we will ever get.", "NTA i was like that. back then before becoming an adult husband father. time to mature", "NTA. Your husband's attitude about the whole thing is appalling. He clearly isn't aware of the message this sends, that he isn't invested enough in his family to care to look good for a dang photo that would please his wife.", "NTA.   It sounds like he is being deliberately passive-aggressive.   Is this behavior you're willing to live with?   I mean, if it's this once, ok, put up with it.  But if this is part of a pattern of passive-aggressive behavior....", "NTA. I hear older men often regret that they didn't take more photos with their family. They don't realize that they'll want to revisit those memories if they've lost a spouse, child, or just want to contemplate about the life that they lived. \n\nI often hear men be remorseful that they don't have many photos of their wife if she passes because they never took any pictures of her, and have to get pictures from family and friends. \n\nThis is part of the reason why marrying people who hold similar values towards family and the expression of love is important. No one who is invested in their family should consider photos to be a \"waste\" of time. \n\nAnd yes, your husband did \"protest\" by wearing a band T-shirt to ruin the photos to get back at you and to make the experience as miserable as possible so that you won't ask again. \n\nGo to marriage counseling, or just accept that you married a man who doesn't care to memorialize memories with his family.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is an AH and should be more considerate with you. I love to take photos when i'm in a relationship, i love the person and will definitely wanna capture our moments together. Sounds like your husband takes you for granted after the time you already spent together. He needs a reality check.", "NTA. My husband is the king of band shirts, but he knows what a professional family photo is supposed to look like.", "He did this intentionally. He intentionally ruined your photos because he doesn\u2019t think it is important. This is a TYPICAL thing American men do. Seriously, leave this dude.\nNTA", "What a fucking child. Take a new family photo without him in it. ESH. Him for doing that and you for letting him be in the picture. Although I guess now you can display it and let everyone see what an asshole he is.", "NTA", "If a spouse reacts this passiv aggressiv, there is usually more behind it. \n\nSo instead of asking if your husband is an ah, you should better invest this time in finding out what the real issue is here. \n\nLoving spouses don't have a problem doing something they know its important for their spouse. Its a no brainer. So smthg is going really wrong in your marriage and you are asking about who the asshole is? How will this solve the issues?\n\nYou guys have 2 kids, whatever is going on in your marriage that leeds to your husband lashing out over a picture, solve it, before you guys are divorced.", "YTA\n\nJust imagine him saying about you \"Is it that hard to wear a dress when I ASK ?!\"", "Dear,\nI would really like some nice photos of us and the kids with me in them. I know taking photos is not an interest of yours, so I opted to book a professional shoot. This way, the work is taken off us, especially you, and we get nice shots.\n\nIt really hurts my feelings that even when I take responsibility for making this happen, you cannot make even minimum effort to dress appropriately. And then act like I should be grateful just because you showed up. Isn't being a partner more than just showing up? What if I just \"showed up\" to a work function for you in my lingerie or pajamas? Or I just \"showed up\" for sex and made no effort? \n\nI know photoshoots can be boring. This was a rare occurrence of something special i asked for. If you have a different solution to how we can get good photos of all of us at once, I am happy to discuss. \n\nNot the best script but something. \n\nMaybe consider discussion or therapy on why he thinks just showing up was good enough.", "YTA, simple, you want something what he dont like....", "Yes YTA.  Husband shows up for you, wants you to be happy.  You don't tell him what to wear because men are mind readers and complain when his mind reading fails.\n\nIf this was important to you then communicate.  He sounds like he was happy to make you happy.  But you let it fail and then blamed him.\n\nYou know him, you've seen him dress, if it wasn't going to be what you wanted then say something.  Could you wear your blue suit with that tie I bought you?  It's neither hard nor complicated.", "NAH. He is acting like a rebellious teen. Lots of husbands do not care for family photos but show up dressed appropriately because they understand the importance it holds for their wife", "YTA", "ESH he should be more understanding of things you want for your family and you shouldn't be blowing up at someone over some photos, wasted money or not, personally me and my wife would laugh it off and take some silly pictures, fun pictures are just as good as \"picture perfect families\"", "YTA. Is it really that hard to wear a bikini to Hooters? Technically no, but you still wouldn't want to do it.", "YTA\n\nHe wants to rep Guns 'N' Roses and, frankly, live his best life.", "[deleted]", "YTA. From your post, it really seems like you only focused on what you want and like. I would advice to sit down with your husband and share your perspectives about taking pictures and reach some middle ground.", "ESH  \n\n\nI would have real problems being nagged into showing up \"not like the slob I apparantly am\".\n\nHiring a photographer who is going to tell me how to be and act knowing full well I am still going to look ridiculous...it all just grionds my gears.
