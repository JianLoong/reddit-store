It's ridiculous that it's come to this.  Is there something else at play here?", "NTA. He\u2019s being ridiculous. He doesn\u2019t need the whole bed to sit down on. And too humid? Please. Firstly, it\u2019s not going to get less humid immediately when you leave the room. Secondly, just open the damn window if it\u2019s such an issue.", "NTA. You have spoiled him. Tell him to get up and get dressed and ready in another room so You can relax in peace.", "NTA what the hell is he talking about? The humidity of a room can't possibly impact his ability to get ready, nor would kicking you and the dogs out cause the level of instant change in either humidity or heat at any meaningful level.  He'd need to air out the room for a while, something he could very well do with you and the dogs in it.  This smacks as an excuse for something else.  Does he have issues being naked in front of you?", "NTA\n\nIt seems like he\u2019s just kinda making excuses especially with the \u201cit\u2019s too hot/too humid\u201d comments. No idea why he would, but that\u2019s what it sounds like", "Here's a solution. Throw a random shirt, trousers, shoes etc in the living room. Tell him to take his clothes and shoes etc out and get ready there. Lock the bedroom door as soon as he steps out. Suddenly he'll be able to get ready in the bedroom with you and half a dozen dogs without a hitch. \n\nYou could also offer to douse the clothes in a jug of water if the room is too hot.", "NTA, he can buy a fan or a chair.

This is a self absorbed, thoughtless guy.", "It sounds like he is jelly you get to sleep extra since you're WFH, and he cannot.

I have no idea why he wants you up and out so bad but his explanation makes no sense, and he's being a jerk on top of it.

He could always just turn it down a few degrees before getting in the shower so it's cooler when he comes back upstairs...", "I agree. And no I highly doubt it, we've been together 6 years and lived together pretty much the entire time. This wasn't an issue when we lived with roommates, or when we lived with his family for a bit.
