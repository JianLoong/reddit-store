Why does he need 100% of a cal king bed to sit on to get ready? NTA", "Half a California King isn't enough room for him to sit down???\n\n\nWhat are we missing here?", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing he likes to practice a little, shall we say, \"self care\" before he gets dressed and goes to work and he can't do that with you in the bed and the dog watching.  Tell him to take care of it in the shower like other guys and go back to sleep.", "NTA. Why does he need to sit in the bed to get ready?? He doesn\u2019t have a chair or a couch or something else he can use? And he requires the space of an ENTIRE cal king to get dressed ? Gtoh. Is he the hulk? Because if not he needs to get over himself", "NTA, sound like he resents you being able to get a bit more sleep on wfh days when he still has to leave.", "NTA...He needs to find a solution that doesn't involve making you get up.  It's ridiculous that it's come to this.  Is there something else at play here?", "NTA. He\u2019s being ridiculous. He doesn\u2019t need the whole bed to sit down on. And too humid? Please. Firstly, it\u2019s not going to get less humid immediately when you leave the room. Secondly, just open the damn window if it\u2019s such an issue.", "NTA. You have spoiled him. Tell him to get up and get dressed and ready in another room so You can relax in peace.", "NTA what the hell is he talking about? The humidity of a room can't possibly impact his ability to get ready, nor would kicking you and the dogs out cause the level of instant change in either humidity or heat at any meaningful level.  He'd need to air out the room for a while, something he could very well do with you and the dogs in it.  This smacks as an excuse for something else.  Does he have issues being naked in front of you?", "NTA\n\nIt seems like he\u2019s just kinda making excuses especially with the \u201cit\u2019s too hot/too humid\u201d comments. No idea why he would, but that\u2019s what it sounds like", "Here's a solution. Throw a random shirt, trousers, shoes etc in the living room. Tell him to take his clothes and shoes etc out and get ready there. Lock the bedroom door as soon as he steps out. Suddenly he'll be able to get ready in the bedroom with you and half a dozen dogs without a hitch. \n\nYou could also offer to douse the clothes in a jug of water if the room is too hot.", "NTA, he can buy a fan or a chair. How little does he care about you getting rest?", "Definitely NTA. If there was enough space for him to sleep on the bed, there\u2019s definitely enough space for him to sit. Especially on a cal king of all things.", "He's asserting dominance.", "NTA he didn\u2019t need the entire bed and maybe tell him to get a fan not that hard", "NTA. You're doing the middle of the night dog duty, and you're getting up 2 hours early to take care of the dogs AND he wants to kick you out of bed on your rare WFH day? This isn't a good guy. This is a self absorbed, thoughtless guy.", "It sounds like he is jelly you get to sleep extra since you're WFH, and he cannot. So instead of being happy for you, he decides that if he can't sleep extra then you can't either. You need to ask him why he enjoys ruining the small extra joy you get from your nap. Definitely some sort of power play.\n\nNTA.", "Why are you living with a toddler? You take care of the pets.. what does he do other than wake you up? NTA but how is a grown man acting like a child attractive in any way?", "NTA it sounds like he just wants you to be uo because he has to be up.", "NTA, he doesn't need the whole bed to get ready.", "NTA, buy him a chair.", "NTA, that's so bizarre. I have no idea why he wants you up and out so bad but his explanation makes no sense, and he's being a jerk on top of it. I'd quietly tuck a supersoaker full of ice water into bed with me when I got back in after walking the dogs and help him out with his overheating problem the moment he started yelling at me.", "Getting ready as in... getting dressed, brushing teeth, showering, etc? Those are not sitting-in-bed activities, so what does he need half a king size bed for? He probably just wants some time to himself before work, which he can get in another room.

He can just get ready after managing the dogs. Its called helping out. He should get used to being your helpmeet as you are his helpmeet.\n\nNTA.", "My thoughts exactly lol", "But she's missing out on sizable profits. :-)\n\nNTA. Run. Fast.", "Exactly. We're both normal sized people, definitely not a space issue.", "Lol probably the most rational explanation yet", "We don't have a chair or anything else to sit on in our room. The other options are our living room couch or a desk chair in our office. Both are downstairs, and our closet is upstairs. I can understand how those aren't very practical, but not sure why a side of the bed isn't enough.", "This makes a lot of sense", "TY. Honestly, I'm not sure. We used to have roommates, and a smaller room and it wasn't an issue then. It was only an issue after we moved to our house by ourselves.", "We have an air conditioner in the room, too. He could always just turn it down a few degrees before getting in the shower so it's cooler when he comes back upstairs...", "I agree. And no I highly doubt it, we've been together 6 years and lived together pretty much the entire time. This wasn't an issue when we lived with roommates, or when we lived with his family for a bit. It's like he's taking advantage of the fact that since we have our own place, I can go downstairs and sleep on the couch instead.", "Worth a shot at this point.", "Unfortunately, no room for a chair in our bedroom but we do already have an AC unit in the room.", "Maybe for putting his socks and shoes on he needs to sit but nothing else requires him to sit. Tell him to go in the living room for the last two", "Buy an inexpensive chair and find a corner to put it in. Hell, I get dried off, dressed and ready in the bathroom with no need to sit down, is he disabled? And California king is plenty big enough. Both my ex and I and the 150# dog slept in that bed and none of us touched. He's being a child and if it's hot or humid he can go downstairs!", "You need to say something along the lines of \"Stop waking me up and find another solution!\"", "Oh, no way\u2014if he already has to go downstairs to shower, then he should take his clothes down with him and get dressed down there. No reason to even return to the bedroom if you\u2019re still sleeping there.", "Fair enough, sounds like selfishness unfortunately, good luck to you resolving it!", "Oh, I do. It ends up starting an argument and he'll start yelling though so I get woken up regardless. It's a lose/lose at the moment.", "If he yells at you in the morning, he's a jerk. Do you have arguments with yelling often? Escalating to yelling when problems are so easily solved seems like a red flag."]}
