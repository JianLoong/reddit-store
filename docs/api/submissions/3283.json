If she entered the marriage with money, those funds should be hers to decide on. \n\nShe has no right to decide what you do with your property or money you entered the marriage with. \n\nAre you sure she didn't marry you to get inheritance for her kids?q", "NTA. This is your hard earned money and your house. They haven\u2019t been in your life that long and this sounds shady.", "NTA. You need a new wife. This actually pretty alarming. Married for 3 years and she wants you to lose your house while you\u2019re still alive plus give each of her kids $100k. \n\nA lot of red flags here.", "NTA don't do it, make sure your will is solid and protected, sounds like your wife is after your money.", "It's a ridiculous for a person to ask a significant other to gift  money should they pass first.  The supposed beneficiaries are all adults that have never been dependents.  Hello, Amazon, I'd like to order as many red sheets to make as many giant red flags as I can.", "NTA\n\nYou both are close to retirement and married for only 3 years. If she does first, they can just have her money.", "NTA. For one thing, your stepsons should be old enough to take care of themselves, for another they should not really inherit anything before _your_ death, even if your wife passes before you. If you will them to have something after you, that would be very generous.", "NTA\n\nWhy did you agree to bequeath them 100K when she dies?  Is she supporting them.  Did you put that in writing as I would rip that up.  You need the money for your own retirement.\n\nI take it the title of your home is in just your name if you brought the house into your marriage.  If the title is in joint ownership it transfers into the surviving owners name automatically.  If it's tenants in common then of the person who died, their portion of the title needs to be sorted out according to the will.  Often there is a clause where the surviving person can live in it until it's sold and then the money is split however you wanted it (unless the surviving person buys out who you wanted the funds disbursed to).\n\nJoint bank accounts go to the surviving person.  Does she have a separate bank account.\n\nYou've been married 3 years.  These aren't your sons.  You actually owe them nothing.  How long have you known them.\n\nYour wife cannot dictate your will.  If she predeceases you then she will have no idea about what you do with your money afterwards.  If you predecease her then have a good will.  If you want your stuff to go to your wife then that's fine... she's free to do with it what she wants once she receives it.  But if you want to give an inheritance to others or to bequeath a donation.. then you need an air tight will and have your solicitor be your executor because you won't be able to trust your wife.\n\nYour wife isn't thinking of your needs after she dies.  She's only thinking about her sons.   They are adults that can support themselves.  They aren't owed an inheritance. No way should you need to rent in your old age.  Perhaps you need to rethink the marriage.", "Nta!! This is crazy", "NTA - she can dispose of your money however she wants if you predecease her, but she has no right to tell you to take care of her children before yourself if she predeceases you. Honestly, this kind of request is weird enough that I'd talk to your lawyer and a PI if I were you.", "Info: What assets did your wife bring into the marriage? If she dies first does all of her assets go to you or has she set some aside in a will for her kids? If she has brought considerable assets into the marriage, and her will is set up for all assets to transfer to you, she is just asking for her kids to get the assets they would have gotten if you had not married and I don\u2019t see a problem with that. If what she is asking is for them to be given money that came from you, not her, then that\u2019s a problem. So if she came into the marriage with 1m in assets (IRA, 401k, money market accounts) and is asking that they are given 500,000 total with you getting the other 500k, I think that\u2019s fair. Are you set to receive a large monetary payout if she were to die?\n\nEdit due to response: NTA for sure!!!!", "NTA Golddigger", "NTA. Who the heck did you marry. That's crazy. Divorce her asap.", "Dated for 3 years, married for 3 years", "NTA. She's being rediculous.", "NTA. It's unreasonable to prioritise their finances over yours and you might need that equity to pay for carers in your old age, particularly if you're on your own. Plus, if you were to split now, that would be money that predates the marriage and she wouldn't have a claim on it, so morally what happens to it should be your decision.\n\nCan I ask how long you've been together in total?", "Do you have any children of your own? If so would they recive anything if she passes before you?", "Info:\n\nDo you have children of your own?\n\nDoes she have own money?\n\nWhat is her argument that if she dies, you should downgrade to poverty basically?", "If the wife is on the title, she officially owns half of the house, correct? If she dies, her sons will inherit her according to whatever the community property/ estate laws of your country/state are. Since you came to the marriage with a lot more money and equity, you need to protect yourself by prenups and keeping the money separate. I think you should talk to a lawyer.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis is exactly why FL is full of single seniors.\n\nThere is zero reason for you to have to rent a home YOU paid for.", "NTA \n\nI would consult a lawyer at the earliest opportunity to discuss this and maybe make a will if you haven't already. It's your money and you're already being generous by bequeathing your stepsons 100k each, and it wouldn't be fair for you to be expected to drastically alter and even jeopardise your future just so they could be taken care of. 600k could disappear quickly if you need medical care, become disabled, or need to go into a nursing home or need in-home care in the future.\n\nYour stepsons are all adults, and unless they have disabilities or health conditions which means they need extra care, they can in all likelihood take care of themselves. It sounds as if they already do, since the eldest is 40. \n\nIt might be prudent to look into establishing a trust fund so they can't have these lump sums of money like your wife wants them to, but can instead have a monthly stipend, so there's no temptation for them to blow the money and then come to you for more.\n\nIt sounds like you're giving them a total of $400,000; with that money in a trust fund there would be enough for them to get monthly stipends without touching the principal until a later date or when you died. You could bequeath them a bit extra in your will, but that would be entirely up to you.", "NTA\n\nYour wife can't will away your premarital property.  If the house is still titled in just your name, it's your house.  if you added her name to the house and it's deeded and it's titled as \"rights of survivorship\", the house reverts entirely to you when she passes.  \n\nYour wife could look into getting a life insurance policy to benefit her kids upon her passing.  Depending on her age and health, however, a million dollar policy might be pretty expensive.", "I hope you have a prenup", "NTA. And if these were your biological children, they still wouldn't get the house until you both pass.
