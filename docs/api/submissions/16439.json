You should really take a look inside yourself and ask yourself about your own personal biases. Not speaking about someone's sexuality is not lying by omission unless others are asking her. Op and his bf were making out in his own personal bedroom, they're not just making out in the open. It's really not hard to not say \"so and so is gay\" just like it's not hard to not say \"so and so has herpes\"", "\u201cHe\u2019s not out yet, it\u2019s not your responsibility to tell people\u201d\n\nWhere is the running list you\u2019re talking about??", "Not even just the guests, sounds like roommate would totally just drop this at a moments notice", ">(EDIT: I made it clear that he wasn\u2019t out and that it wasn\u2019t her responsibility to out him to anyone)", "Being out comes with a lot negative consequences, up to and including getting killed. That is why very few queer people are fully out in all situations because homophobia is still the default in the world. It is not up to anyone but that individual themselves to decided whether or not they wish to suffer those consequences and if so from who and in which situations. When you out someone you are deliberately painting a target on their back, it is an act of violence when done to another.", "The danger isn't just violent assault. It's stuff like not being able to get a job or a place to live. It's discrimination on all levels, like those judgements and invasive questions you mentioned.", "Very proud of you for being open to learning  that's good parenting! Xx", "Room mate's reaction is making it an act of malice. Especially as she isn't going to tell her friends to remain silent, thus putting this young man further at risk. Her initial act might have been one of naivety but the point where that defense was possible has long since been passed.", "I just literally saw a newspiece ten minutes ago on Reddit about a guy getting 21 years for shooting a 16 year old nine times after finding out he was gay. In the US.\n\nNot to mention their orientation may affect relationships and employment.\n\nThe dangers of being gay aren't tied to Islamism, nor are all the dangers physical.", "If she thinks she's an ally, she needs to be told this:\n\nBeing an ally means supporting gays rights, INCLUDING the right to come out to who you want, when you want. Not when someone thinks \"these people are ok to tell\"\n\nIf she and her friends think it's fine to take away that right and out people even just amongst each other, then they are not allies, they are by definition taking away a gay person's rights and categorically homophobic", "Me either. I kinda assumed you were in the lounge. Perhaps I misread it. Either way NTA.", "Thank you. I\u2019m trying. \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc9c", "No worries. Maybe it wasn\u2019t as obvious in the original post.", "And if Roommate didn't know her friend was actually homophobic and assumed they weren't? Lgbt+ people get murdered all the time for existing. If roommate's friend straight up attacked op or his bf what then? That whole 99% of people do not care is false considering the current political climate. Just turn on a tv. People very much care about who's lgbt and don't want us to exist.", "It's shitty people downvoted you for asking.   \n\n\nUntil a lesbian started gaming with my husband's group there was lots of stuff we didn't know. Stuff that would not be obvious to most people, even ally's.   \n\n\nMy husband is an immigrant and gets bigoted shade tossed at him for an obvious accent, especially since 2016. We thought we had had an appropriate taste of bigotry enough to make us think of stuff most people wouldn't.....we were wrong.   \n\n\nPersonally, I would not be friends with bigots. Therefore I would not have thought that introducing them to MY FRIENDS would be a big deal. Like, I'm friends with them, they're in my home....LOL, they've been pre-screened. I feel like my like-minded friend should know that. Except people who don't know me don't know that, so I now assume nothing when it comes to outing people. I get it now. It's all a learning curve.", "Yes, I completely agree with you!"]}
