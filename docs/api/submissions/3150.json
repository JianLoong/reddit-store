Attending the wedding knowing that they hate your husband because of his religion is Disrespectful to your husband.\nI know for sure if someone invited my wife without me to their wedding and my wife attended that's mean one thing \" i don't care if they hate me, but it's mean my wife doesn't respect me enough to stay by my side \"\n\nYour cousin is the one who are ruining her wedding. From my perspective she said :\n\nI'm getting married and i invite you only don't bring your husband because my husband doesn't like him.\n\nShe favorite her husband and you favorite yours \n\nAnd about the loyalty test and forcing the whole family to chose her or you, that a childish thing to do.\n\nI like how your family sided with you. From my perspective NTA your a great wife.", "Or maybe op doesn't want to be unkind even to the bigots. Or wants objective advice without political influences", "Based on the avatar it looks like op is male. I\u2019m assuming the family is homophobic", "Im only on fb so I only see the snippets but 8tits a man and his wife they tend to focus on the woman's side like with relationships headwear and how they handle men that aren't apart of the immediate family . The husband is even a converted Muslim\n\nEdit:it's it ironic I post this them find a video the name is mehdinatv", "Gotta always bring Trump into it.  Can\u2019t help yourselves.  Get over that.  Yawn.", "Unfortunately, the last couple of times on AITA a woman has talked about her husband or boyfriend being part of a group with some type of specific belief but doesn't go into detail...he's ended up being a neo-Nazi, so people are just going off a pattern.", "I agree", "I don't think it matters what views he has... OP is asking a specific question, and that question is if she is the AH for declining an invite... whatever the reason she has every right to decline the invite just as the cousin has every right not to give her a plus one... from all the comments, I get that people are trying to make this more than it actually is... it's just a simple question... NTA", "My wife is religious, I'm not. If someone invites me to a wedding and doesn't give me a +1 for my wife because of her religion, I'm NOT going to come to the wedding. Period.\n\nNTA. You were kind enough to soften the blow and tell her you couldn't get time off. I would have just told her the real reason.\n\nEdit: added a word", "NTA, sounds like your cousin ruined her own wedding with the loyalty test.  But, seriously, how did she think this would play out?", "NTA. It's the groom who is dividing the family by having intolerant views and your cousin is enabling him by going along with it. If her future husband's friends are more important to your cousin than you and your husband then she made a choice and you are just choosing based on what is left for you. Stand your ground and just avoid them.", "OMG\u2014 NTA! Your cousin is just as bad as her soon to be husband. Accepting his bigotry and excluding your husband from her wedding is affirming that she\u2019s ok with supporting his beliefs. You aren\u2019t the one ruining this family or the wedding. You don\u2019t have the bigoted views. You didn\u2019t give the family the ultimatum. Let her live with her choices. Don\u2019t go to the wedding.", "OP is NTA.\n\nbut cousins family is.\n\nOP your cousin would've had been oblivious to the fact you are not going because you gave her a different reason you cant go so as to keep the peace. i understand you didnt want to upset the bride, and i commend you for that. even with your hurt, you still thought of her.\n\n\nyour aunt on the other hand, is an old asshat who just HAD to tell her daughter the real reason. sheesh. what did she expect to happen? \n\nyour cousin's husband is a jerk.\n\nyour cousin even more so for having that loyalty test in the family. of course your own family will choose you over her. she's delusional.\n\nshe brought this upon herself.", "Ok but OPs cousin thinks it\u2019s ok to not invite your husband because of how her husband feels about your husband? I would be livid.", "That's why you should be careful with ultimatums. She expected your nuclear family to choose her??? What a delusion. NTA", "NTA..... that's your husband and there's no legitimate reason he can't go so if you don't want to go that's fine. Your parents and siblings not going is awesome because it let's the rest know that just as the bride's mom and siblings are on her side, your core family is gonna ride with you!!! As it should be.... so carry on and feel fine about it.", "I think there is alot of missing information here.\n\nWhat are your husbands views, you seem to have skimmed over this but if it is offensive than you have to expect people to uncomfortable around him.\n\nHow did the Brides mother find out? I am not sure why you would share his information and than be surprised that the Bride found  out?\n\nSaying that I suppose its a moot point, it an invite not a summons. you can go or not go for whatever reason.", "Seems like there\u2019s a lot of INFO missing here. I don\u2019t really think I can make a decision about this until I learn why James is so against your husbands religion and his beliefs. The fact that you left literally no info about the context of that raises some red flags.", "Same.", "This right here. OP is not an AH for declining a wedding invitation. Her cousin is an AH for making a big deal out of OP declining the invite. Why the husband was left off the invite doesn\u2019t matter. OP is choosing one of the two options a person has when receiving an invitation to an event.", "Hmm if it were Nazis wouldn\u2019t OP just say that though?", "What if the fiance has a bunch of LGBTQA friends and the husband is an evangelical Christian? \n\nIt's way too vague to know who's right or wrong here.", "You're quite correct - we really need OP to come back and add some clarification here....", "Except OP mentions that the fianc\u00e9 has joined a group that has an issue with the religion and whose members will hate the husband due to his religion. You know of any groups that feel that way about Mormons or Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses??", "People talk too much about the nazis nowadays.", "I think it means James too", "Anyone espousing those beliefs needs to be exposed and called out. There is no way to talk too much about this."]}
