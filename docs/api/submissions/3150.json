Let's call them Chloe and James.\n\nSo Chloe and James have been in a relationship now for about 5-6 years and have two kids together, I've been invited to the wedding reception BUT no plus one, I've been with my husband for 10 years so was a little hurt that he wasn't invited but hey ho I understand that the numbers are limited so it is what it is.\n\nHOWEVER, I recently had a conversation with my brother and his girlfriend has been invited and they have only been together for 3 months. My other brother also has a plus one and he is going to bring a friend. I spoke with my aunt about this and it turns out my husband is not invited because of his religion.\n\nIt turns out James does not feel comfortable having my husband at the wedding due to his personal views, and due to a group he has become associated with, a lot of these associates will also be at the wedding.\n\nObviously this has upset me a lot so I respectfully declined the wedding invite and informed my cousin that I could not attend ( I gave an excuse, and said that I could not get the time off work to attend, I am a nurse and it can be difficult to get time off). Flashforward to this morning brides mother decided to tell her the real reason that I am not attending she has messaged me telling me how I am ruining her day and that I shouldn't care about what her soon to be husband believes as she does not share his views. Now I am not angry at my cousin I understand you can't help who you love and he does seem to be a great dad to their two kids, what I can't stand is the thought of being in a room with a bunch of people who hate my husband (eventhough they've never met him) because of his religion \n\nI have stood my ground and said that I won't attend as I don't feel it would be a healthy environment for me to be in (if anyone said anything to me about my husband I know I would cause a scene) my cousin has now called a loyalty test and asked the whole family to either choose me and my husband or her and her soon to be husband. Both of my brothers, sister, mum and dad have now said that they won't attend due to the conflict. ( I didn't ask any of them to they have made this decision all based on how my cousin has reacted)\n\nMy aunt is saying that I am going to ruin this family and my cousins wedding for declining the wedding invite and that i should be able to sit there and be there to support my cousin on her wedding day.\n\nI have told my husband everything and he fully supports whatever I do he just wants me to be happy and he knows me and my cousin used to be close growing up.\n\nI am very conflicted between accepting the invite and just 'sucking it up' and standing by my original choice.\n\nSo AITA for declining my cousins wedding invite", "created_utc": 1669311408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3pwkp/aita_for_ruining_my_cousins_wedding/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That alone was a valid reason.  James and Chloe making this a test of loyalty or ideological purity are huge AHs here and getting what they asked for.  \n\nEDIT: I missed the part that husband was excluded based on their religion.

I\u2019d reconsider this relationship with your cousin.", "NTA I feel like being an adult means that you have to be able to accept that others have different views than your own sometimes. I would have done the same", "From the post, you're being incredibly vague what \"views\" your husband is being judged for. But assuming it's ultra-conservative religious ones, then yes, probably best to skip the wedding than stir and have a confrontation on THEIR special day.\n\nGonna go NAH, unless he's pointedly pushing and antagonizing people to start drama.

Not only for moral/ethical reasons,  but also for safety reasons.

Even though their so called concerns aren't valid at all and that cultural vs actual, Muslim views aren't what people think they are. A lot of the bad shit we see regarding the Islamic culture/religion is more cultural based not actually in their Bible/religious rules/laws. It varies by family in reality. (Theirs an amazing couple on TikTok and fb reels that go thru what is actually cultural vs reality in the Islamic faith. Its not what people think. It's a lot more choice based than people seem to get)\n\nSo sounds like he may be of Islamic faith and they are being bigoted instead of getting to know the man as who he is.
