It would be sensible to be aware of the possibility, just in case it ever continued to escalate.\n\nRed flags don\u2019t necessarily mean that someone will become abusive, it is simply that there are warning signs we recognise routinely crop up before events like these escalate, so we share them in order to be aware. \n\nIt isn\u2019t pitchforks at sundown & chants of \u201cDump him now!\u201d Rather, people are saying, \u201chey, heads up, that\u2019s a red flag.\u201d\n\nETA: For what it is worth, I reckon she deserves better just because he doesn\u2019t seem very helpful & caring. The red flag is a sidenote, to the more immediate issue, which is he seems to routinely have her take on the mental load, & palm the work off on her, as evidenced by the fact that she knew he wouldn\u2019t help, & he was only concerned after he\u2019d been shown up.

Like okay if you don\u2019t want to help your gf, fine, enjoy your game. But it takes some pretty big nerve to then get mad when someone else does. \ud83d\ude44"]}
