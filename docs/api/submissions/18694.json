Yer boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to be actin' a bit childish and insecure. Instead of appreciatin' the neighbor's help, he got all upset and started makin' demands.

Tell your boyfriend that a male gamer on here said that he should have told you, \"If you let me finish what I'm doing I promise I will carry them all up for you in 10 minutes.\"  You both win.  He gets to finish the game he is currently on and you know that he actually gives a damn.  Or, he can just live by himself and game until he's a fat 40 year-old with only online friends and cheesy poof dust on his hands and shirt.

And honestly, be prepared for this to get worse\u2026 \n\nMy husband is a gamer as well and not once has he ever said \u201clater\u201d when it came to stuff like that.

It hurt his ego to hear you praise the neighbor, and instead of reflecting on how his actions caused the whole situation, he got mad at and blamed you. NTA, your boyfriend needs to mature a bit and do some self reflecting. Keep praising and thanking your neighbor when he helps, it will hopefully help him turn out to be a more considerate and helpful person than your bf is being at this time. (Btw, my bf has stopped in the middle of live online activity on his favorite game to help me bring groceries into the house. I hadn't known, or I would have mentioned he could delay helping because I respect his game time-give and take).", "NTA\n\n\nYour bf is 28, he needs to grow up", "NTA.

Your bf is acting like a big ol\u2019 baby!", "NTA you just moved why would you need to ask your BF to help? That would be the default.

Putting limits on who and how you can ask for help is concerning.", "It's hilarious that he's jealous of a teenager who was nice enough to help you with your packages. \n\nThis also could be a red flag. He wants to gatekeep what you can and can't say to another. Remind him you initially asked him for help and he waved you off so he could return to his game; now he's in a snit. NTA.", "It\u2019s unbelievable to me that people are telling you to break up over what you put in this post. I think people that give advice like that are assholes. Total assholes. Yeah maybe he didn\u2019t help you when you asked immediately. Maybe you went on a little bit too much about this young man to make him feel jealous. That\u2019s probably what you were doing even if you don\u2019t realize it.ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
