Thanksgiving doesn't cancel that out. I get the feeling your birthday has been sidelined this way a few times \ud83d\ude44\n\nSecondly, yeah he should have gone with you, or at the least come back after an hour or two instead of staying out til 10pm. Having a 4 and 2 year old is exhausting even they're well, he was thoughtless to fob everything off on you until 10pm.", "INFO: Why didn\u2019t your husband hang on to the 2 year old?  Did you ask him to? That certainly would have reduced your stress level.", "NTA. Your children always come first and playing cards is a crappy excuse. I also highly doubt this is the first time this behavior has happened. I will look up couples therapy or divorce attorneys because honestly it\u2019s not gonna get better.", "NTA-you and the kids are family too, and unless you left out that you somehow see his relatives more often than he does, he\u2019s the AH. The only way this can go in any other direction is only if he keeps the 2 yo with him, not only to help share responsibility, but also because under the idea of \u201cfamily gathering\u201d the 2 yo should have stayed to hang out with everyone else.", "He's not an A-H for wanting to stay back with his extended family, but he is for making you take the 2 year old as well. 2 year old should've stayed with him and you can go with the sick kid.", "INFO: Did you ask him to come with you? How agreeable were you when he said he wanted to stay and play cards? How did you express your feelings to him and how did he respond? There's no actual conflict here, just your feelings.", "As I emphasize with you in this situation as a parent of a toddler , I think you fail to communicate your message to him. No one can read mind especially in these situations where someone is meeting their loved one after long time.You didn\u2019t mention any communication between you and hubby which sums it up that he wasn\u2019t aware that you needed help.", "We don\u2019t have enough information. From what I read it doesn\u2019t even sound like there has been a confrontation yet. Sounds like you\u2019re just here to vent. Can\u2019t say who is the AH", "ESH\n\nYou both need to communicate better.  He isn't telepathic so won't know what you are thinking unless you tell him.  But by the same token he really should ask in this kind of situation instead of seemingly avoiding it.\n\nAlso it's your birthday which understandably plays second fiddle to a major national holiday but a bit of compassion wouldn't go amiss.  He is seeing them the following day and later in the week so not like he is going to really miss out.\n\nHowever it really is a myth that you need both parents to look after a couple of kids when one of them has a fever.  We were there plenty of times when our kids were young so I appreciate the pain but also know people are more than capable of doing it by themselves.  There seems to also be no reason for the 2year old to stay with him while you concentrated on your oldest.\n\nRealistically this all just boils down to both of you not communicating properly.   Each of you missed opportunities to do something that would have avoided all of this strife but for some reason chose not to.", "Marriage is give and take. If he only sees his relatives every so often I would cut him some slack. The 5 year old's fever was annoying to deal with single handedly but it was hardly an emergency requiring two parents to handle.  Your being severely put out he did not want to break off from interacting with his relatives (after all, he had seen them a whole 5 hours and that was enough!) to assist in transporting two kids, is a bit over the top.", "ESH\n\nPlease don\u2019t take this to heart, but you do come across as ever so slightly controlling. Communication is key and it sounds like there wasn\u2019t enough of it going on in this instance. He\u2019s just as responsible for the care of the child as you are. He could have handled this situation better.", "Given that you chose to post here, in this format.. YES YTA.  \n\n\nYou should have insisted your partner stop his frivolities and demanded he assist you in caring for your sick child.  \n\n\nYou are probably getting this deleted because you formatted this wrong.

My birthday's a couple of days away, frequently falls on Thanksgiving, know the feeling. A sick crying four year old and a 2 year who may fall sick at any moment (my kids usually went like dominoes after the fist one got sick) leaving you at a strange place. Pretty selfish of him.", "He said he felt like she would \"miss her mommy\"", "No, I didn't ask him to come with me. I didn't think I needed to. I was not agreeable in my body language, but then I also wasn't trying to make a scene and embarass him or myself in front of his family. We were not in a position to have a private conversation. His avoiding eye contact, nomverbal cues etc tells me he knew I would prefer him to help but that he was option not to.", "good point. A lot of women fall victim to the \"if you loved me you'd know.\" No one can read your mind. Many men will take the \"you didn't say so, so I thought it was OK\" route to get out of doing something they don't want to do. I've seen several of my friends' marriages end because the husband had the attitude it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission. Both dynamics seem to be at play here.", "So I just responded to you with a question asking how often he gets to see his family. I posted that without having read this. Nevermind, he is TA just for this. If his answer had been something like \"I want to spend quality time with my relatives who I barely get to see\" I actually would have potentially accepted that reasoning. But if his reasoning is that your vagina obligates you to do all the difficult parts of child-raising, then you are definitely NTA and you might consider divorce. If you're gonna be a single parent either way you might as well be collecting child support payments and/or have breaks during his custody.", "He\u2019s TA for that.  It\u2019s very understandable that he wants to spend more time with his family; I suspect with 2 little ones in the house, living far enough away that you\u2019re staying over multiple days, he\u2019s probably not getting much time with his family.  He had an option to stay longer and not leave you juggling 2 small kids, one of whom is sick, far from home.\n\nBut you\u2019re TA for being so dismissive of the importance of him getting time with his family.  5 hours may have been enough for you, but it clearly wasn\u2019t for him.\n\nI think you\u2019re both lacking in consideration for each other.", "~~okay, second question: Who was there, how far away are they and how often does he get to see them?\n\nCause if it was just his parents that he sees every other week, that's BS, but if it's people who he only gets to see once or twice a year, and it's a situation that, albeit difficult, you knew you could handle, then it's actually not really asshole behavior on his part to want to maximize his time spent with his family.~~\n\nEdit: I just saw your answer to why he didn't take the 2-year-old. Nevermind. NTA. Get off reddit and look up marriage counselors and/or divorce attorneys.", "What do you mean non verbal cues and disagreeable body language?  What exactly were you doing to try and get your point across", "Yeah, I was going to respond to you \"have you ever tried to play cards, serious card game that took concentration, with a 2 YO vying for your attention? That's why he didn't want to keep the 2YO. husband is at least a selfish jerk if not total AH. My ex's family were serious card players so I know how it can get.", "Yeah, and if he'd actually said he wanted quality time with his family without the kids, and he was sorry and he'd make it up to her, then he's maybe being a bit selfish, but if he actually followed up on the making it up to her, then I'd say it's within the expected give and take of a marriage. It's the part where he tries to guilt her into it using gender roles where I say fuck that shit, divorce the asshole.", "concur."]}
