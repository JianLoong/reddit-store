It was also not meant to be done in one day and the rangers said it was hard to do in one day and not advised. \n\nShe said she was confident she could do it saying she had hiked harder and she is very fit but I just felt like she was discounting what the rangers said. I said I wasn\u2019t going and she said she would go alone and I asked her to wait till tomorrow for me to recover. She said the weather report had a 30% chance of rain for tomorrow and that she wasn\u2019t going to give up on a bucket list hike and if I still wanted to do it tomorrow she would do it again with me. I got mad because I felt like she was ok with abandoning me with nothing to do at her campsite and I didn\u2019t want to talk to her that evening but she didn\u2019t seem to care and prepped for her hike.\n\nShe finished it the next day and I feel like she didn\u2019t care that I was too tried to hike and chose to go without me.

You didn\u2019t seem bothered about the danger of her going alone but are butthurt that she didn\u2019t cancel so you wouldn\u2019t be by yourself. Also it sounds like you\u2019re just upset that she didn\u2019t give in when you were immature and refused to talk to her.", "YTA 100%.  You knew this was a bucket list item for her, you must be awfully proud of yourself to think that a benign thing like going on a hike alone because you aren't up to it is a betrayal.", "You went on a trip to go on this specific hike, and only the day before realized your not fit enough to go on said hike? And you really expected her to just abandon her dream now that it was right there in front of her? YTA.", "YTA.  It's a bucket list hike for her and you should have prepped for it and made sure you were as fit as her before going on that trip.  \n\nYou don't get to tell her how important her hiking should be to her.", "YTA. \" *I said I wasn\u2019t going and she said she would go alone*...\"  So she did. That you asked her to abandon her dream hike because of your limits was completely selfish.\n\n*\"She finished it the next day and I feel like she didn\u2019t care that I was too tried to hike and chose to go without me. To me the people are more important than the activities but to her she definitely wanted to finish the hike at all costs.\"*  When a man does this, we applaud his perseverance and initiative. When your girl friend did it, rather than congratulate her, you choose to whine. This is so not a good look.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't adequately plan/train for this, when you knew it was deeply important for your partner. Then when you, unsurprisingly, are dealing w the consequences of your lack of training, you want her to forgo the \"bucket list\" item to sit w you. \n\nWtf. You're incredibly selfish and an AH. Can't help but wonder where else you're holding her back, frankly.", "Yta dude. It was a goal of her's and she finished it like she said she would. Idk why you'd want to take that away from her", "YTA. You sound envious of the fact she\u2019s in better shape than you, like that\u2019s her fault. \n\nWhy are you pouting that she wanted to and was able to finish a difficult trail? Some people make it a personal mission to complete a goal they have in mind. It does seem like you\u2019re being negative and clingy here. Good for her for doing something she wanted to do. She\u2019s not obligated to stay with you the whole time you\u2019re there.\n\nThis sounds more like you being envious of her skill vs an upset over feeling abandoned.\n\nWhy hold her back? YTA.", "YTA. She said she'd go with you the next day; she just also said she was going THAT day. On her \"dream hike\". Perfectly reasonable.", "YTA. Her purpose for being there was this dream hike or hers, sounds like your purpose was to hike with her which she tried to accommodate by doing the hike with you again the following day. She didn\u2019t abandon you she simply is doing more than you. Might suck for some but that\u2019s life. It\u2019s not like she left you for a week. And saying with nothing to do, that sounds like you werent prepared. There are plenty of things you can do at a campsite that doesn\u2019t involve hiking the trails. You could\u2019ve brought things to keep you occupied. Just because you can\u2019t do something doesn\u2019t mean she shouldnt especially when she was making changes to her plans for you.", "YTA. Why did you expect her to give up the hike of her dreams for you? Seemed like you didn\u2019t care for the hike anyway so she went and did it and you could have done something else together the next day. You both coulda enjoyed a solo activity for a day.", "YTA. the trip was planned to do this specific hike. \n\nWhy would she not go for the hike just because you can\u2019t do it? \n\nIt\u2019s not about you. The trip was about the hike. \n\nHer life and plans don\u2019t revolve around you.", "YTA because it seems like you cared more about being left alone than being concerned about her safety if she hikes alone. \nAlthough I think she should have listened to the rangers, you shouldn\u2018t dismiss her dream because you were unable to keep pace with her. As a supportive boyfriend you should be able to understand her desire and be understanding.", "YTA - you are expecting her to miss out on a rare chance to do something she had dreamed of. \n\nThere are generally lots of things to do near the campgrounds, and I know Grand Canyon has nice shorter walks and hikes and a good interpretive center, so you had plenty of options for things to do.\n\nFor all the people saying NTA or NAH because of what the rangers said, that's often very generic advice, and someone who is an experienced hiker can take that into consideration but still judge for themselves. GF does sound very experienced and prepared, and like she has thought this out quite thoroughly, so I don't see why that's so bad (I say this as an experienced hiker/backpacker myself).", "It\u2019s like you are holding a big glass of cold water in front of someone who has been in the desert for a day and because you\u2019re not thirsty, they can\u2019t have any.  \nDumb analogy, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.", "YTA She needed to do that hike when she needed to do it. You may never understand how it fed her soul to be there in the moment. It wasn\u2019t a reflection on you or your relationship with her until you made it about you. It\u2019s not a reflection on your fitness, knowing what you can or can\u2019t achieve is important. But somehow you\u2019re mad at her for being more prepared.\n\nIt IS a reflection on your relationship that you wanted her to give up something important to her, the rangers gave advice based on the typical visitor, you\u2019re using that to paint her in a bad light even though she successfully completed the hike. Where\u2019s your pride in her achievement? Why are you sulking that this strong, proud woman is yours?\n\nShe loves you and that means she loves your dreams too. Love her, love her strength, love her dreams because these are what make her\u2026her.", "YTA.\n\nSo, you weren't concerned about her going on a difficult hike by herself? You were completely worried that she would leave you to rest and relax and recuperate on your own - which is abandonment, apparently. \n\nYou say that people are more important than activities, but you don't seem to care one jot for your girlfriend's desire to go for a hike that she's ALWAYS WANTED TO DO. You mostly seem to care about being bored if left on your own.", "\"abandoning me with nothing to do at her campsite and I didn\u2019t want to talk to her that evening\"\n\nYTA, OP. You can't entertain yourself for a day? You use the silent treatment and get upset when it doesn't garner the results you'd hoped for? Your gf has been wanting to do this forever, and she did it. If you couldn't join her, your task was to support her, not pout and flail.", "YTA, you were too tired and the world doesn't revolve around you.", "YTA.  This was her reason for being at the grand canyon. Next time, if there is one, I'm betting you won't be invited.", "\"I didn't want to talk to her and she didn't care\"... Lol she's probably tired of you doing this shit for attention. And went on her dream hike while you sucked it up. You don't need anything to do at the camp site any way, you've got recuperating to do , remember. A true partner would be happy to let someone go do their thing, because they like seeing them happy.", "YTA.  Unless she gets to hike the Grand Canyon everyday, you shouldn\u2019t ask her to give up her dream hike because you are too out of shape to complete it yourself.  How selfish!", "Anyone else notice he said they were camping in California but the Grand Canyon is in Arizona?", "So to recap:\n\nYou guys planned a vacation around an activity she loves to do and you were all in for that vacation, but didn't train for it at all.\n\nOn said vacation, you got to the night before the keystone activity and you wimped out and tried to use the excuse that the 'Rangers said it wasn't meant to be done in one day.' Then, instead of being apologetic about the fact that you were abandoning her to hike it alone, you sulked all night.\n\nYour gf went anyway, finished the hike that 'wasn't meant to be done in a day' easily, and so you decided to further sulk by going online and writing this post.\n\nSound accurate?\n\nYTA.", "While it may not be the best decision, to go hiking alone, it's her choice. If you can't go and she still wants to do it? Yeah. That's her decision, not yours.\n\nThe wording is where you get the, yes, you're being an AH.\n\nYou EXPECT her to cancel for you. Not because it's dangerous to do it alone, but for you because you can't go.", "YTA - She went for a bucket list hike, you were not up for it.  She was even willing to accommodate you by doing it the next day, but if it did rain there is chance of ice and impassable conditions.  She risked not being able to accomplish something important to her because you had hurt feelings?", "YTA. You got mad because she was \u201cabandoning\u201d you for a SINGLE day to fulfill a bucket list item and because you had nothing to do at the campsite? Dude, wtf. Yes, it\u2019s not the best idea to go hiking alone, but she\u2019s been preparing for it. It\u2019s been a dream for her to accomplish this, so why should she wait for you to recover, when this hike was going to be harder for you?", "I'm the \"not fit\" one in my relationship. Wanna know what happens when we go skiing in the winter? I ain't skiing, I'm reading one book per day enjoying the view while he's out there having fun in the snow. \n\nLast month we were on a week end trip, I fell on the first day and sprained my ankle pretty bad. We had to cancel all the activities we were planning to do together but I encouraged him to do stuff on his own because being stuck at the Airbnb with me would not have been fun for either of us. \n\nSometimes things happen on vacations and you have to change some plans.", "YTA would I rather do something on my bucket list or sit around a campsite with the person who guilted me into waiting around for a day. Your an adult you can be alone in a campsite for a day. If you can't... learn to be less codependent", "YTA. That\u2019s her dream hike dude. Boyfriend out of shape isn\u2019t going to hold her back. The question I have is why you didn\u2019t find your own back up plan and expect her to sacrifice a bucket list item. The ranger gives advice on the average American fitness level (that fits you and not your gf). Have some grace.", "Yeah YTA. It sounds like she really understands her abilities, and you don\u2019t understand yours. These are very tough hikes. It sounds like you expected her to sit around at the campsite with you, for an entire day. That\u2019s ridiculous. Especially if she is in good enough shape for you to take a rest day, and for her to do the hike two days in a row.", "YTA.\n\nYou agreed to this trip.  Your GF is \"super into hiking\" but you didn't feel the need to get into shape for it.\n\nThe ranger's warning is a moot point since she was able to finish in one day. You were right not to go along since you probably would have ruined the hike for her with your whining.\n\nShe may be too into hiking and not enough into YOU for your liking, but she is definitely not AH for fulfilling her dream.  You got to chill at camp all day, so I really don't know what you're complaining about.", "Even you are describing it as her \"dream hike\". How can you not understand that it was incredibly selfish of you to even suggest that she might give that up to sit around with you?\n\nYTA", "Yeah YTA. She stuck to the original plan, which it sounds like was a huge part of the reason for the trip in the first place. She didn\u2019t guilt you or try to force you to go, she just did her thing. She did nothing wrong.", "YTA. Why would you expect your SO to give up their dream of something they are about to accomplish bc YOU can\u2019t keep up, couldn\u2019t do it or think she shouldn\u2019t? If my spouse made that statement to me, I would never look at him the same and our relationship would never be the same honestly. It\u2019s a dealbreaker.", "YTA You should have been getting in shape prior to going. Like you don't go to a marathon without getting into shape prior then ask others to wait because you didn't prepare.", "What did you want her to do while you sat on your rear-end and recovered at the camp site? Was she supposed to sit there and listen to you whine about your need to recover. You sound a bit like a young teen just hitting puberty, not a fully functioning adult. You don't sound like a good partner.", "I didn't hear once that you were concerned for her safety. Yta", "YTA Why should she suffer just because she is in better shape?", "YTA if you can\u2019t manage a day alone. This was important to her and you wanted to make it all about you.", "YTA \n\nThis was a bucket list thing for her. It\u2019s not her fault you weren\u2019t fit enough for the first hike and needed recovery time.\n\nThrowing a tantrum about it is a good way to become single.", "YTA", "Yta you knew it was that important to her you should have prepared better. I\u2019m happy she got it done and can now plan her next excursions probably without you.", "YTA and good for her, I'm glad she didn't let you hold her back!", "She planned and traveled to do this bucket list hike. She knew she could do the hike in a day and she did it. You\u2019re being a spoilsport and whiner. YTA", "YTA for not knowing the Grand Canyon is NOT in Cali which makes me think the entire story is made up", "Sorry, but soft YTA.  This was a planned trip and it was on her bucket list.  The sole purpose of going was for her to do the hike.  She offered to go again with you once you recovered.  \n\nIf you had hurt yourself on the first hike and needed her assistance and she abandoned you, then I would see it as an issue, but that was not the case here.   Give her some slack.", "You knew she really wanted it. Why would you be so selfish?!", "YTA", "She's a regular experienced hiker. You aren't. She said she could do it and she did. Respect her abilities. YOU are the reason it would have taken 2 days. You are the only danger to her because you aren't a seasoned hiker .. like she is. \n\nHave you no respect for her? For her ability to make decisions for herself?  Do you see what she accomplished and feel proud?? If not, maybe it's time to move on. You clearly don't think she capable. And you should, she sounds awesome. Capable, athletic, competent. \n\nI mean you can argue safety but the biggest safety issue was always you. Without you she went at a pace then ensured her finishing in a decent time.\n\nEdit. Yta", "YTA because in no way were you worried for her safety.  You were just mad she went without you.", "YTA this was her dream hike and you obviously couldn\u2019t have done it at her level anyway. You are being selfish.", "YTA you admit in the last line that your reasons for going on this trip are different. You went in order to spend time with her, she went in order to fulfill a lifelong dream. Both of those values are valid reasons to go on the trip, but you can\u2019t expect her to come all this way to fulfill a dream and then just pass up that opportunity because you\u2019re too tired and sore. \nIt\u2019s great that you wanted to spend time with her but if you actually value her happiness you wouldn\u2019t be holding this against her. \n\nIt would be one thing if you were worried about her going on the hike alone, that\u2019s a valid concern from a partner, but you just don\u2019t want her doing things that are important to her without you present. That\u2019s controlling and not what love is about.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nDon't hold your gf back from experiencing things. You were just fine to sit at the hotel and wait for her since it was so important to her. Sometimes life sucks and you have to change plans. If it matters for you to be able to tag along on every hike, get yourself in better shape. Until then, be prepared to not be able to do certain bucket list hikes of hers if you decide to go along. You can't expect her to do less just bc you can't. She offered a compromise too - she'd go *again* the next day with you but wanted to keep going that day while you rested, bc she didn't need it. This is a problem that's quite easily solved for the future, if you want it solved anyways.", "Soft YTA. This is something she's wanted to do and had planned for so she did it. Like she said she wasn't going to give up the opportunity. She wasn't leaving you behind. She listened to how you were doing and respected your decision to not go. You should respect her decision to go. She sounds fairly experienced so maybe you gotta factor that into what the rangers were saying.", "YTA you planned a hiking trip with your hiking obsessed girlfriend, then acted like a child when she wouldn\u2019t blow off hiking to hang around camp with you. It sounds like this was the first time y\u2019all took this kind of trip together, and you underestimated how physically demanding hiking is.", "Enh. YTA. It sounds like your pride was hurt more than anything here. I could go E S H because it's dangerous to hike alone - but it feels like this is about your pride more than anything else.", "I really wanted to say N T A because it seemed like you were concerned for her safety. However that opinion changed at the end when all you wanted to complain about was how you were left alone at camp by yourself. \n\nYTA because you knew that the first hike was fun and the second was her bucket list hike. If you knew how much her dream hike meant to her and you knew you were as in shape as her you could have easily sat out the first hike and been fine for the important one. Instead you chose to hike the first day and then give her an ultimatum and then pout when she didn\u2019t cave.", "Oh get over yourself. You are an adult: you can entertain yourself for one day. It\u2019s perfectly normal for people to occasionally do different activities on a trip together. YTA", "YTA - You\u2019ve told us all about your feelings, but at what point did you consider your girlfriend\u2019s feelings?  \n\nThis was a planned activity, it\u2019s unfortunate you couldn\u2019t go, but you\u2019re being incredibly whiny about being left unsupervised and unentertained.", "YTA because of your reasons for not wanting her to go. No matter how fit she is, hiking alone almost anywhere, much less a strenuous hike in the Grand Canyon is extremely dangerous.  But this wasn\u2019t your concern. Your concern was you being bored. You may want to review your feelings for your gf if you are more concerned with \u201cI may get bored\u201d over \u201cmy gf may die\u201d.", "YTA. Why guilt her for pursuing a dream because you're too out of shape to keep up? You didn't mention an injury, and she even offered you accommodations (going twice). You're lucky she even invited you, knowing full well she'd be dealing with this. She'll (hopefully) leave you for someone who is more on her wavelength when it comes to fitness.", "Yta.", "You flaked put of the plan. If someone was abandoned it was her. But as she is a grown up she did the hike anyway and let you rest. What exactly is the problem? You are too tired to walk but can't be left alone? She should give up her bucket list hike because you didn't prepare?\n\nBe glad you have a girl like that. She seems great!", "YTA - sometimes two people want to do different things on vacation and it\u2019s ok to take a few excursions separately if they\u2019re not a good fit for both.

Don't go on active trips if you're going to whine about how tired you are. This was your gf's bucket list hike.", "YTA  \nWhy do supposedly grown men have this need for someone to entertain them? You're on a road trip, I'm pretty sure you have some form of entertainment with you or you could've gotten some.  \nAnd the whole silent treatment is so lame. I'm glad she seems to be immune to it.

Find a way to entertain yourself.", "The Grand Canyon is still in Arizona.", "YTA. I noticed how you originally mentioned your concern about her hiking it in one day.  You almost sounded like you cared for her.  Then you forgot yourself and were honest.  You weren\u2019t worried about her.  You were pissed she wouldn\u2019t entertain/babysit you because you over did it.  You didn\u2019t break a leg or an arm.  You were tired. Surely you can take care of yourself for one day.", "YTA. I did the Bright Angel in the Grand Canyon. I trained 6 months to be ready. There is no way I would have given up the opportunity to hike that hike during a once in a lifetime trip.

You, OP, overworked yourself. Assuming you\u2019re not an avid hiker because even common hikers understand their limits and recovery time.

I truly don\u2019t understand your post, yea people are important but this is her *bucket list hike* and tried to take it from her. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t physically be able to do the hike today, tomorrow, next week. I wouldn\u2019t go with you either. \n\nThere are some things couples do alone, we all have goals and aspirations and likes/dislikes what *you* deem *the most important* at any particular time and expecting her to go with it is controlling.", "YTA big time.\n\nI had an ex who wasn\u2019t in as good of shape as me. He repeatedly attempted to derail my bucket list items and every time he did it hacked away at my sense of trust. Be out of shape, that\u2019s fine. Hold me back from goals? Not okay. Also the people giving you points for concern about hiking alone? Also not okay in my book. She was the one who planned this and prepared. To automatically assume she didn\u2019t understand the full scope and questioning her abilities shows issues IMO.\n\nOne of the reasons said person is an EX", "YTA. There is no real reason why she should've waited for you to feel better. She made it clear that the hike was very important for her, you shouldn't expect her to just give up her dream hike just because you can't keep up with her.

You were just acting way too clingy and you should have let her go on her dream hike without question.", "Yta ... the vacation was focussed on the hike I'm guessing you get very limited or even no vacation days and you expected her to cancel her bucket list holiday because YOU didn't prepare", "YTA. This is her *dream* hike. She was excited, eager and wanted to prove to herself that she can do the hike on her own.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t go but she respected that and was okay  to go with you *if* you wanted to try the hike the next day.

So, I told him next time we went somewhere with great hiking, I would do longer, harder hikes solo while he slept in or did his thing, then we could do shorter hikes and other activities together. When we got the opportunity to go to CO again, I did just that - I went out and did a long hike by myself one morning because he didn't want to and was still tired from our shorter hike the day before.

I suspect that the dream hike was all the way down to the river and back, because that's one of the ones where it says \"if you think you can, you probably cannot\" and visitors are warned repeatedly about the risks of attempting it.\n\nSo yes, I agree with ESH. OP could have focused on other things - there's a lot to do there, even in the off season - and GF could have listened to those who knew the trails and risks.", "It really wasn\u2019t reckless. It\u2019s a challenging but very popular hike. It sounds like the rangers were giving pretty broad/conservative advice because certainly not everyone should attempt it but people do it every day.", "He says Grand Canyon but also says \"trip to Cali,\" which is not where the Grand Canyon is. I'm thinking it's a Yosemite canyon hike.", "I disagree, if she\u2019s an avid hike she probably is pretty familiar with her limits.

If it were actually impassible or there were serious dangers, wouldn't they have closed off that section of the trail? \n\nAlso if it were \"too ambitious\" for her she wouldn't have been able to finish it in one day, which she did. \n\nI do agree though that OP should have prepared better for this trip.", "She knew she could do the hike. How does that make her cocky?", "I'm not so sure on this.  It is possible, even likely,  the Rangers were giving advice to \"them,\" as opposed to \"her,\" based on their observations of OP's lack of fitness.  I think we need to know more to day she failed to follow the Rangers' advice.", "Yes!

Also, I distinctly remember being in Cinque Terre in Italy where my SO spent the day in Corniglia climbing the 377 steps and lunching while I took a day out of our vacation to deal with a work deadline. It would never have occurred to me that he shouldn't have fun just because I couldn't have fun. And in this case, guy knew what the vacation entailed and it was his girlfriend's dream hike, he should've been working on his fitness level if he wanted to join her.", "Well, since OP was \"too tired\" and needed to recharge, a stay at a campsite with nothing to do sounds like the perfect remedy...", "There's a difference between experienced and expert.\n\nSame as there's a difference between someone that swims for their school, and someone that swims for the Olympics.\n\nOps gf knew she could do it and it was a dream of hers  - i don't see how OP could have helped much tbh even if he had been there.\n\nPresumably his gf is intelligent enough to take safety precautions -  GPS locator and flares etc.", "It was one day.  She was crunching what should have been two days hiking into one day.", "Yep. YTA OP", "I don\u2019t know her and was concerned about her safety!", "I thought that too!

I was feeling crazy", "There is *a* Grand Canyon (of the Tuolumne in Yosemite) in California, though.", "If he got wiped out by the prep hike, there is no way he would have been able to do the harder bucket list hike.

Or does he mean \"I am more important than my gf achieving a long held ambition'?", "For one day! It was literally just one day that he was without her, and to him that's \"abandoning him\". Jesus Christ, I'm afraid of what's gonna happen if she wants to have a spa weekend by herself, or an evening out with her girlfriends. ABANDONMENT. HOW DARE SHE. She needs to stay home, to keep him company at all times! Passion, a hobby? Sure... if he's also there. If not, forget it. \n\nThis is just such controlling bullshit.", "People ARE more important... Which is why your girlfriend should have been an important enough person for you to support her tackling this hike for which she was totally prepared and you were not.", "Yeah OP probably completely ruined the fun mood of her finishing a dream.  \n\nIt's pretty crappy to suck the joy out of someone like that!", "There's nothing wrong with hiking alone if you're an experienced hiker and adequately prepared. Even if OP was trying to hide behind being afraid of her going alone, he'd still be an asshole.\n\nIt's a bucket list hike she traveled to get to... Unless there was inclement weather or something like that, there was no reason for her to skip out on it.", "That's the subtext I got as well.

This smells a little fishy.", "Yeah, I came into this thinking that maybe the gf had overstepped her limits and was trying to do something really dangerous. My guess is she wanted to hike the Bright Angel Trail down and back, which is a 12 mile round trip. If you're in shape and pack correctly, it totally doable, but hard.   \n\n\nI can completely understand OP chickening out. The GC is no joke and that hike has seen a lot of death. The reason he's TA, to me, is because of this sulking bullshit.   \n\n\nOP, I get it, you were scared. But don't turn that around and try and make your gf feel guilty for doing the hike she had planned to do. It's okay to be frightened by nature. But remember that about yourself and don't be a dick to the people you allegedly love just because you were sore and afraid.", "I agree. I also thought he would bring up her safety but that was not a concern to him. It was all about him.", "A lot of better hikers will disregard ranger advice way too often.

I could be wrong though! The timeline here is murky.", "Even with the Rangers advice (which is to average people, not athletes), he still says she successfully completed the hike.

That's pretty common on many hikes. \" 4-6\" hours for a weekend warrior is not the same for someone who has trained specifically for that type of hike.

It's a bucket list hike for her and you should have prepped for it and made sure you were as fit as..", "Agreed.

Literal bragging rights factors are rarely ever left out of the description.", "Or he could have\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014started training for a hike that strenuous, so that he could do it with her and know he could finish it.", "I'll be honest, when I read through I don't think I saw anywhere where he personally stated his concern about the danger. Sure, the park rangers said it was dangerous but his reason for being upset seems to be \"she left me alone.\"\n\n\nHad his reaction been \"I'm worried about her going alone because it's really dangerous, and if she falls and hurts herself, who is going to call for help?\", Then I would have thought N T A. \n\n\n\n\nBut with the context he gave, I'd say it's more of a YTA", "Right? I was allowing room for a reasonable safety objection on his part, and then he started whining about being abandoned at the campsite. Poor OP, unable to survive alone for a day.", "Looks like his main concern is not having anything to do while she is gone.
