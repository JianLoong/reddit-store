You don't deserve her.", "YTA - honesty is not always the best policy. You didn\u2019t need to tell her that you didn\u2019t like the dances. Be honest - you didn\u2019t do it to encourage her to get better at dancing. You did it because you didn\u2019t like it. If you actually enjoyed the fact that she was dancing for the joy of it, it wouldn\u2019t matter to you how good she was or how bad it was to watch. Do some reflection and then do better.", "I swear I\u2019ve seen this before lol. \n\nYTA. She\u2019s been dancing and is more confident because of it, she\u2019s not that good yet but she\u2019s still putting the effort in. Do you know how long it takes to get ready? Do you know how vulnerable it is to do something like that for your partner? Do you know how much money sexy outfits cost? This shit takes a lot of effort and you just told her \u201cyou\u2019re not very good please stop.\u201d\n\nSometimes honesty isn\u2019t the best policy. Is it really so hard to sit for a dance every once in a while? I understand it\u2019s personal and intimate, but are you really so uncomfortable that you had to absolutely destroy her confidence because of it?\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be uncomfy or dislike the dancing, but the way you went about it was shitty. Don\u2019t be shocked when she doesn\u2019t feel confident enough to touch you for a while.", "YTA \n\nShe was already shy about dancing in front of you anyways and then you go shit on her ? Yeah good luck bud that was the last time she\u2019s ever gonna try and do something sexy for you. \n\nAnd then this entire post is you poking fun at her on the internet ? Let\u2019s be real if you need us to tell you wether you\u2019re an ass or not you\u2019re also delusional as well. Imagine how she\u2019d feel if she saw this", "YTA. It takes a number of years and a lot of practise to get really proficient and smooth and confident, so after only a few months she would still be learning the basics, and was showing you how she\u2019s doing to get some support and encouragement, and have you tell her she is looking beautiful and sexy. She felt safe to dance for you, and all you had to do is be supportive and encouraging. Excusing your comments as just being honest, is just what you\u2019re telling yourself to make it sound ok to erode your wife\u2019s self esteem.  It\u2019s not hard to watch a loved one dance, and love them for having a go and just enjoy being in a shared moment. Do you cut your children down if they dance or whatever badly, or do you encourage them? I\u2019ve done burlesque for my husband before, and I know I am far from perfect, but he\u2019d never cut me down like that. She knows you\u2019re not a safe person to dance for now. Don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019ve not only turned her off dancing for you ever again, but also turned her off entirely. \n\nTypically in a class when they perform and practise in front of each other, the women in the room absolutely hype you up no matter what stage of learning you\u2019re at. It helps you relax, get into the zone, and is an amazing boost to the confidence. If a room full of women who aren\u2019t romantically involved with her can be supportive, there\u2019s no excuse for you. You don\u2019t have to get off on it, just love that she loves it and enjoy making her feel good about herself. If you can\u2019t do that honestly, then the problem isn\u2019t her dancing, it\u2019s you.", "YTA - Wife is going above and beyond to spice it up and you shot her down.", "Maybe she wasn't expecting you to be such a connoisseur of striptease.\n\nIt's you Boo.", "YTA. Damn, I'd never want to do anything for you after that.", "YTA - You should have just let her go and have fun, regardless of how much it sucks. Now she has lost confidence in herself while trying to do something nice for you.", "YTA, not for not liking the dancing, but for saying it's because of her skill level. You're not her adjudicator, you're her partner. You are entitled to honesty about your likes and dislikes but not about your opinions and judgements. Feel uncomfortable? Admit it. Not into it? Admit it, with acknowledgement and appreciation for all her effort, and admiration for her vulnerability. Think it's because of her lack of polish and skill? Take it to your grave. She wasn't doing it for a score on her technical and artistic performance. She was doing it for excitement, passion, and intimacy with you.", "YTA \n\nSpeaking as someone who does burlesque, and has seen every level of expertise in performers from having never danced before to being a world renowned professional dancer, you absolutely are TA.\n\nThe entire point of burlesque is personal, and body empowerment for the performers who do it. Whether they are a brand new beginner, or a burlesque legend who's been dancing for decades. In one single conversation, you took any confidence in her body, and her movement that your partner may have developed through these classes, and you shattered it.\n\nAnd for what? Because you couldn't be bothered to give her a few minutes of your time while she did something that made her feel good about herself? \n\nHow could you possibly think you're NTA in this scenario?", "YTA for sure. They probably made her feel more confident.", "YTA\n\nNo, honestly isn't always the best policy. As an adult you should know that.", "YTA\n\nHoly moly are you a jackass.  How could you not \"like\" your wife dancing for you?  The point wasn't to dance like a professional pole dancer.  The point was to show you how much she loved you.  \n\n>but that the dances haven't been doing it for me.\n\nOh, I'm sorry - I didn't realize that the dancing was useless if it didn't turn you on.  Have you considered that maybe the problem is your cold sterile heart?\n\nI'd honestly be shocked if she ever dances for you ever again.", "YTA.", "YTA, but even moreso just a very foolish man. I would not blame her if she were cool and distant and generally un-interested in you for a while.", "YTA. Look man, this is part of marriage. We listen to high school sports stories and pretend to be interested in your JV baseball team winning the city tournament, you pretend to love our uncoordinated dance moves and enthusiastically encourage us to keep practicing until we don\u2019t look like one of those windsock things outside a car dealership anymore.

Good luck.\n\nNTA. Just not a good liar when you get ambushed with the question: Isn't this hot?", "There's a scene in big bang theory where Sheldon does the Tango, its was awkwardly bad, but Amy still liked it because she loved him. Your partner going out of their way to keep things spicy is huge, its east to fall into a lull. \n\nShe went out of her way to try and be sexy for you, she isn't a professional. Imagine you putting in effort to do something for her and she didn't appreciate it, how would you feel? \n\nDo you even like her?\n\nYTA", "YTA for two reasons \n\n1) You shouldn't have told her you liked it when you didn't. You've entirely set up this situation, trying something new and finding your partner isnt into it is a bit awkward maybe but its whatever. Doing something repeatedly, being told its good and then having that taken back is a whole other level. \n\n2) Making this about her skill not just your own thoughts. You dont have to love the performances but you dont have to say SHE isnt doing it for you. \n\nActually there's a 3rd reason\n\n3) You should be willing to watch her performances for her benefit. Its fine to acknowledge you dont find it that sexy or whatever (albeit taking into account one and two), but its not just a sex thing its a new hobby she's practicing.", "YTA as the \"show\" might not necessarily be for you, it might be for her.", "A lot of people going y t a here, but I think they're confusing \"aita for not liking my wife's dances\" with \"aita for not pretending to like them\" - they're voting y t a as if you asked the former when you actually asked the latter\n\nYou can't help that you're not enjoying it. It sucks that you don't, but here we are.

What an idiot.", "Man, you don\u2019t deserve a wife like that.\n\nNot only did you take something she enjoyed and make her feel bad / more insecure about it, it\u2019s clear that she was also doing this in part for you. \n\nYTA", "YTA.

You can't be forced to be attracted to something you aren't. If something is uncomfortable for you,  you shouldn't be shamed for being uncomfortable, turned off etc. So you're nta on that.  (If ANYONE  regardless of gender, age,  relationship staus etc is not comfortable with a sexual situation,  they're nta for feeling the way they do and are nta for saying they do not feel comfortable with it)\n\nyou def were a complete dick for how you said it. you could have given her some suggestions or made it into a fun joke together when she fell or slipped up instead of making fun of her and bullying her. (If i fell over trying to give my husband a lap dance, i know both of us would be holding each other laughing and enjoying the moment) \n\nThe way you said it is awful. I feel horrible for her.  She's probably so embarrassed and her self confidence is likely shot. Im sure she knows she isn't shakira and isn't winning a twerking competition anytime soon. But the fact that she took those classes for YOU is something you should appreciate. Give her praise on the parts she's good at! It will keep her doing what you're into/ working on bettering those things and keep her feeling sexy for you. Id make you sleep on the couch for a month if you were that cruel. I feel bad for her.  She'll probably never do anything to please you again for fear you'll bully her", "NTA for being honest eventually. It\u2019s quite difficult to say whether you were the AH for saying it was great after 1st dance, I\u2019d say no because of course you didn\u2019t want to make her depressed after her 1st try.

Even when she's being a goofball, and stumbling, stuttering, etc. If either of us were to PAY to take classes to dance, sing, write poetry, etc. Constructive criticism would be all either of us would give.\n\nSpecifically trying to turn your spouse on, and failing completely is a very uncomfortable situation for the recipient. Let's say my wife thought I loved lip biting, but I hate it. She does is twice a week. Now she's asking if I want her to do it more. Am I an asshole for saying \"No, that really doesn't do it for me, I'm not a fan.\" I'm not. This is an uncomfortable situation for both of these people. OP could've done better about telling her (but not by much, he was pretty on point with timing, and was NOWHERE near as aggressive as an actual asshole would be) but his wife could've been more empathetic toward his feelings as well.\n\nThis man clearly cares about this woman enough to attempt to spare her feelings, and ask a bunch of strangers if he went too far. She's taking classes (that aren't cheap) in order to develop a skill. If he were to just say \"Oh, I loved it a lot! Please do it more!\" she would think she's turning him on, and that he loves her dancing. Him saying that he doesn't, is embarassing, yes. But wouldn't it be much more embarassing if she pictured herself as an actual exotic dancer, and later found out he didn't like it at all? Maybe he loves her natural self, rather than a \"show\" she's putting on to arouse him. I know I much prefer my wife as her natural self rather than a facade put on to arouse me. She's much sexier to me than any skill she can learn from a class.\n\nNTA. Neither is your wife. This post is extremely human, and shows discomfort, embarassment, and concern on both sides. You should for sure try to encourage her a little bit more to get better at the skill she wants to learn. Sensual dancing is very good exercise, and it can boost confidence by a great deal. Not to mention, if it's seen as more of a learning experience with no expectations of blowing your dick off with arousal, it can be a great bonding experience for both of you. You were both put in an uncomfy situation, and neither of you handled it 100% perfectly. But I'll say again. Neither of you are assholes for it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, people shouldn\u2019t inflict their hobbies on others. It\u2019s her thing, and that is great.

How does anyone in the comments defend that??   \nAnd as for the comments directed towards saying she's doing it for her, not him, if it was for her she wouldn't want his validation on it.

If god forbid my husband got into this sexy dance stuff and I didn\u2019t find it hot I wouldn\u2019t just keep letting him think I was into it, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d know.

Neither me or my husband ever consider sexiness related to a sexy dance performance or anything else. In the past we both had preconceived notions of what sexy is. But have had lots of talk about what we find sexy about each other. I had to explain to him that it wasn\u2019t what society pointed at. Same for him. What trips our triggers is so not related to a sexy dance or we are constantly bombarded with as being sexy. \n\nIs it fun for her? Absolutely. But obviously not for him. Could he have explained this to her differently? Yes. But she also has to understand that her husband possibly finds her sexy without the added floorshow. There is absolutely nothing wrong with him being honest. Supporting his wife in her efforts is fine but expecting him to pretend to enjoy it is a bit odd. \n\nNTA.

You could watch her dance if she asks you to just watch but if the goal is to arouse you and you are not aroused you cannot just fake it. I love my husband very much and am attracted to him and have a good sex life but if he started doing clumsy sexy dances or weird dirty talk or something that just does not arouse me I would tell him the truth in a gentle way, it is best for a healthy sex life to be honest about likes and dislikes. I don\u2019t think you have to be aroused just because she put a lot of effort into it, that does not make you an asshole. You can appreciate the effort and tell her that.  You can still be supportive by encouraging to continue her classes, dance for herself, for friends or even for you, you can watch her but you don\u2019t have to be aroused by it.", "NTA.

It's by far better than just letting the frustration grow or even worse, having the truth come out after a lot of time.\n\nShe's going to be upset and that's just natural. Give her time and make her understand that you never meant to hurt her and that you like/love her for who she is and not for the dances.\n\nThis being said, if dancing is something she really likes and that she's doing out of passion and not just because she wants to display it to you, make sure she doesn't quit it.", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA.

I told my husband to figure out dinner and wake me up when it's done. He bought the wrong cut of meat, dry when I like fat on my meat. Am I supposed to just choke it down and praise him??

Seeing your partner look uncomfortable is not generally something that is going to set the mood. It can be endearing, absolutely. But if he sees her being uncomfortable, and it makes him uncomfortable because he is afraid to be honest with her. Now it's just two uncomfortable people trying to be intimate. And now he has to lie about that too. \n\nA Loving husband should be honest. How do you think she would feel if he faked it and just sucked it up out of pity? Or would you expect him to lie about that too. Just lies on lies until resentment sets in? \n\nSome guys don't enjoy strip clubs or that form of interaction. And if she is taking these class for the purpose of turning him on. She is doing it for the wrong reasons in the first place.  \n\nWhy is it that if men are honest and express how something makes us feel we are assholes.

While enthusiasm can come from some primal and unknown place where visceral attraction dwells, it can and should also come from your ability to engage with people supportively and intellectually, which OP failed to do with his wife. He couldn't get himself to see beyond her literal physical performance, which was a massive empathy and relationship fail.", "That, watches dances in porn/movies, or follows people who show off their skills on social media.

I can guarantee if some other person hit on him and tried to seduce him with almost the exact same words he would just think it was weird and uncomfortable.
