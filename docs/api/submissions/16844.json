You don't deserve her.", "YTA - honesty is not always the best policy. You didn\u2019t need to tell her that you didn\u2019t like the dances. Be honest - you didn\u2019t do it to encourage her to get better at dancing. You did it because you didn\u2019t like it. If you actually enjoyed the fact that she was dancing for the joy of it, it wouldn\u2019t matter to you how good she was or how bad it was to watch. Do some reflection and then do better.", "I swear I\u2019ve seen this before lol. \n\nYTA. She\u2019s been dancing and is more confident because of it, she\u2019s not that good yet but she\u2019s still putting the effort in. Do you know how long it takes to get ready? Do you know how vulnerable it is to do something like that for your partner? Do you know how much money sexy outfits cost? This shit takes a lot of effort and you just told her \u201cyou\u2019re not very good please stop.\u201d\n\nSometimes honesty isn\u2019t the best policy. Is it really so hard to sit for a dance every once in a while? I understand it\u2019s personal and intimate, but are you really so uncomfortable that you had to absolutely destroy her confidence because of it?\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be uncomfy or dislike the dancing, but the way you went about it was shitty. Don\u2019t be shocked when she doesn\u2019t feel confident enough to touch you for a while.", "YTA \n\nShe was already shy about dancing in front of you anyways and then you go shit on her ? Yeah good luck bud that was the last time she\u2019s ever gonna try and do something sexy for you. \n\nAnd then this entire post is you poking fun at her on the internet ? Let\u2019s be real if you need us to tell you wether you\u2019re an ass or not you\u2019re also delusional as well. Imagine how she\u2019d feel if she saw this", "YTA. It takes a number of years and a lot of practise to get really proficient and smooth and confident, so after only a few months she would still be learning the basics, and was showing you how she\u2019s doing to get some support and encouragement, and have you tell her she is looking beautiful and sexy. She felt safe to dance for you, and all you had to do is be supportive and encouraging. Excusing your comments as just being honest, is just what you\u2019re telling yourself to make it sound ok to erode your wife\u2019s self esteem.  It\u2019s not hard to watch a loved one dance, and love them for having a go and just enjoy being in a shared moment. Do you cut your children down if they dance or whatever badly, or do you encourage them? I\u2019ve done burlesque for my husband before, and I know I am far from perfect, but he\u2019d never cut me down like that. She knows you\u2019re not a safe person to dance for now. Don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019ve not only turned her off dancing for you ever again, but also turned her off entirely. \n\nTypically in a class when they perform and practise in front of each other, the women in the room absolutely hype you up no matter what stage of learning you\u2019re at. It helps you relax, get into the zone, and is an amazing boost to the confidence. If a room full of women who aren\u2019t romantically involved with her can be supportive, there\u2019s no excuse for you. You don\u2019t have to get off on it, just love that she loves it and enjoy making her feel good about herself. If you can\u2019t do that honestly, then the problem isn\u2019t her dancing, it\u2019s you.", "YTA - Wife is going above and beyond to spice it up and you shot her down.", "Maybe she wasn't expecting you to be such a connoisseur of striptease.\n\nIt's you Boo.", "YTA. Damn, I'd never want to do anything for you after that.", "YTA - You should have just let her go and have fun, regardless of how much it sucks. Now she has lost confidence in herself while trying to do something nice for you.", "YTA, not for not liking the dancing, but for saying it's because of her skill level. You're not her adjudicator, you're her partner. You are entitled to honesty about your likes and dislikes but not about your opinions and judgements. Feel uncomfortable? Admit it. Not into it? Admit it, with acknowledgement and appreciation for all her effort, and admiration for her vulnerability. Think it's because of her lack of polish and skill? Take it to your grave. She wasn't doing it for a score on her technical and artistic performance. She was doing it for excitement, passion, and intimacy with you.", "YTA \n\nSpeaking as someone who does burlesque, and has seen every level of expertise in performers from having never danced before to being a world renowned professional dancer, you absolutely are TA.\n\nThe entire point of burlesque is personal, and body empowerment for the performers who do it. Whether they are a brand new beginner, or a burlesque legend who's been dancing for decades. In one single conversation, you took any confidence in her body, and her movement that your partner may have developed through these classes, and you shattered it.\n\nAnd for what? Because you couldn't be bothered to give her a few minutes of your time while she did something that made her feel good about herself? \n\nHow could you possibly think you're NTA in this scenario?", "YTA for sure. They probably made her feel more confident.", "YTA\n\nNo, honestly isn't always the best policy. As an adult you should know that.", "YTA\n\nHoly moly are you a jackass.  How could you not \"like\" your wife dancing for you?  The point wasn't to dance like a professional pole dancer.  The point was to show you how much she loved you.  \n\n>but that the dances haven't been doing it for me.\n\nOh, I'm sorry - I didn't realize that the dancing was useless if it didn't turn you on.  Have you considered that maybe the problem is your cold sterile heart?\n\nI'd honestly be shocked if she ever dances for you ever again.", "YTA.", "YTA, but even moreso just a very foolish man.

You've entirely set up this situation, trying something new and finding your partner isnt into it is a bit awkward maybe but its whatever. Doing something repeatedly, being told its good and then having that taken back is a whole other level. \n\n2) Making this about her skill not just your own thoughts. You dont have to love the performances but you dont have to say SHE isnt doing it for you. \n\nActually there's a 3rd reason\n\n3) You should be willing to watch her performances for her benefit.

(If ANYONE  regardless of gender, age,  relationship staus etc is not comfortable with a sexual situation,  they're nta for feeling the way they do and are nta for saying they do not feel comfortable with it)\n\nyou def were a complete dick for how you said it. you could have given her some suggestions or made it into a fun joke together when she fell or slipped up instead of making fun of her and bullying her. (If i fell over trying to give my husband a lap dance, i know both of us would be holding each other laughing and enjoying the moment) \n\nThe way you said it is awful. I feel horrible for her.  She's probably so embarrassed and her self confidence is likely shot. Im sure she knows she isn't shakira and isn't winning a twerking competition anytime soon. But the fact that she took those classes for YOU is something you should appreciate. Give her praise on the parts she's good at! It will keep her doing what you're into/ working on bettering those things and keep her feeling sexy for you. Id make you sleep on the couch for a month if you were that cruel. I feel bad for her.
