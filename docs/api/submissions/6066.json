I am a life long skier and part of it entails trying to get good deals on lift tickets. We set a date we were going and a few days before I saw a great deal at Costco. About $40 cheaper per ticket so I bought 2 for my friend and her bf. I have the epic pass so I was covered.\n\nOn the day of the ski trip I give her the tickets and she\u2019s annoyed at me saying I shouldn\u2019t have gotten them and she would buy at the front desk. I told her it\u2019s more expensive that way and she said she wants to double check. We get to the ticket booth and low and behold the tickets I bought were cheaper. She uses them for her and her bf and we go skiing. I also texted them the receipts but she never replies or anything. A week later I remind her to please pay me for the tickets. She replies that I didn\u2019t tell her I had to pay her and I told her I sent her the receipts which was my way of saying I was asking to be reimbursed. She calls me to tell me that she didn\u2019t want the tickets she wanted to buy at the ticket booth and that because she bought tickets in advanced she isn\u2019t obligated to pay me because I didn\u2019t ask her. I was pretty pissed because I tried to save her money and what did it matter that she didn\u2019t buy it at the ticket booth it didn\u2019t matter? I told her she used the tickets and saved money and I expected the money back. She said she will see and hung up but hasn\u2019t replied with anything and it\u2019s been another week.", "created_utc": 1672451546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzi5yq/aita_for_expecting_my_friend_to_pay_me_for/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you couldn't phone her to tell her the tickets are cheap in Costco and if she wants you to get them? She sucks because considering you actually did her a favour and saved her money her insistance on wanting to pay more and then not wanting to pay you is dumb. I hope you both leaned lessons here. Also \"Sending her the receipts was my way of telling her.\" USE YOUR WORDS!", "ESH - your friend was going to spend the money anyway and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s upset you were right about the price difference. \n\nOP don\u2019t buy things for people you expect to be reimbursed if you don\u2019t clear it with them beforehand in the future. You were trying to be nice and helpful, but it can put pressure on people to give you money. Maybe the friend feels a transaction with the booth is less awkward then paying you for something.", "ESH. She should pay you since you gave her something that she was going to buy anyway. But as a general rule, don't ever buy things for people expecting to be paid back unless they know of and agree to the plan in advance. And if you do expect to be reimbursed, don't just text a picture of a receipt - use your words and ask.", "YTA.  You should have asked her first before purchasing them.  Something like, \"Hey, I can buy tickets cheaper here.  Do you want me to pick them up, and then you can just pay me back?\"  That would have saved yourself a whole lot of drama.", "YTA, you should have asked. Your friend may have had a gift card to pay with or some other form of payment like a credit card. That means she can\u2019t pay right away, but will later. She\u2019s likely annoyed she has to come up with cash to pay you back when she could have had it on credit or possibly \u201cfree\u201d if using a gift card. Maybe see if that\u2019s the case and you can take repayment in other ways like food or something she can pay with a card.", "I'm confused about all of this because for the majority of it, you make it sound like they hadn't bought tickets yet, but then you say they said they bought tickets in advance.\n\nIf they already had tickets, and you bought them tickets and are demanding compensation, then YTA.", "NTA of course but \"She replies that I didn\u2019t tell her I had to pay her\" is basically you being naive and giving her the cards to use against you because tbf she's right \ud83d\ude05 she didn't ask you to purchase on their behalf and you didn't ask for payment prior to purchasing. \n\nCommunication is key and stop making assumptions. People won't be always honest nor considerate, even if you call them your friend.", "YTA. You should've called her and asked her if she wanted you to get them while you were at Costco. Part of being an adult entails basic communication. Honestly, I would've bought my own anyway and not accepted them from you.", "YTA.\n\nNever buy stuff for a person unless you spoke to them before and they want you to do so.\nIn any other scenario, this seems like a gift. You can't expect someone to just pay without having spoken about it before.", "NTA but I wouldn't have purchased the tickets or handed them to her without talking to her and receiving payment first.", "YTA.  A simple call stating \"I've found some lift tickets which are cheaper.  I can buy them if you'd like and instead of paying full price at the counter, you can just pay me.  Is that o.k.?\"", "YTA \n\nI have an Aunt who does things like this all the time.  \u201cOh I saw this item on sale and knew you were looking for one so I got it for you.\u201d Then a week later - hey are you going to pay me for that item I bought you that you didn\u2019t ask me to pick up? \n\nUnless you talk to the person prior to buying to see if they want you to pick it up for them and they\u2019ll pay you back - you should not expect to be paid back.", "ESH. She was definitely going to go, she was definitely going to pay more, so I don't get why she wouldn't pay you back. Except, you probably should've confirmed they wanted the tickets before you bought them. I'm an avid penny-pincher, so speaking personally, I'd be eternally grateful for your bargain shopping. That said, some people take offense to this. The reasons vary. Your head and heart were in the right place, but it doesn't hurt to ask.", "ESH. You should have asked her if she wanted you to pick up the cheaper advance tickets. Your assumptions here seem logical so something else is going on here.\n\nMaybe she feels awkward paying you directly. Maybe she wanted to actually buy something herself on the trip instead of you doing everything for her. Maybe she\u2019s mad that you third-wheeled her and her bf\u2019s ski trip. Maybe she spent her money elsewhere and doesn\u2019t have it right now.", "Esh \n\nEven though you knew that she would use them. You should have called her up and told her about them before buying them. You can't expect someone to pay you when you don't even ask if they want the help. \n\nShe was willing to pay more anyways. She could have been graceful that you wanted to help her save money.", "ESH", "NTA \n\nYou were helping your friend out, however, you should have checked with your friend first.

Talking about these things before you make assumptions and buy first.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t see the big deal about not checking with her first as she was planning on paying for the ticket anyway (only a more expensive ticket). It sounds like you did a nice thing and sending a receipt is direct request for payment. It would be like going to dinner, putting it on your card, and sending a Venmo request.", "YTA.  You should've called your friend at Costco.", "[deleted]", "NTA. You saved her money on something she had every intention to buy anyway. \n\nA lot of this yta responses are giving me a headache. Comparing you to window washing or jewelry giving scam artists as if you benefit from this in any sort of way. You were literally only helping her at no benefit to yourself. Not even at a slight profit that would still save money. Get your money and cut the weirdos out of your life.", "NTA. No good deed goes unpunished.  She used the tickets, it saved her money, she should have been delighted to pay you.  I sure would have.", "NTA and she\u2019s not your friend", "NTA. But it's because of people like your friend, I will not do anything good for other before checking with them. Forget the money, and consider you got rid of a fake friend.", "ESH. You should have checked with her before you bought the tickets to make sure she wanted them. She should pay you back since she used the tickets. Both of y\u2019all need to work on communicating.", "YTA - Don't buy items expecting others to pay you when they did not give you consent. Take 3 minutes to text her to confirm her interest. You sound overbearing.", "YTA, you gave them something they didn't want and then told them to pay for it. You remind me of street vendors in NYC who give you a \"free\" piece of jewelry and then ask you to pay for it", "YTA. You bought something on your own accord (she never asked you to) and then all of a sudden you expect to be paid back? Really?", "NTA. Your friend is a scam artist, but a bad one.", "NTA. That friend is. But punctuation, darling, please!", "ESH.   But the real question is:  why are you friends with this person who takes advantage of you?", "YTA and I think you already know this.  You know those people who run out and \"wash\" your windshield, while you're at a red light, and then demand payment?", "Are you kidding?? You\u2019re such a good friend and your friend is a huge AH!!!", "YTA - \"Here's a gift. Pay me back.\"", "NTA but don\u2019t take it upon yourself to buy things for people you\u2019ll want reimbursement for without talking to them first, no matter the good intentions, just accept it as a social custom thing", "NTA. This is juvenile behavior on her part. Is she trying to claim she thought you gave her and her BF tickets as a gift?\n\nIf she didn't want to them, or simply didn't want to pay you for them, she should have said \"no, thank you\" and bought her own.\n\nUsing your tickets without paying you makes her the AH.", "NTA, if she was that offended she should have bought the more expensive ticket and left you with the extra to use at a later date. She's not much of a friend and it might be worth the price of the ticket to find that out.", "Going against the grain, and saying NTA. Your friend sounds unreasonable. Should you have text her and asked if she wanted them? Probably. But no one I know would be upset over cheaper tickets to something they were going to buy anyways.", "Well, she used them. She would have had to pay much more of she'd bought them herself. Why is it a big thing to give YOU the money instead of the place you were skiing?\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
