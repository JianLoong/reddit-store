I\u2019ve also seen a cash back offer for my chase card from a ski resort before but didn\u2019t look into it further so unsure if that\u2019s a thing. Or they got a certain amount of credits alongside paying for their room or other discounts or rate reductions that would require buying a lift ticket to access.\n\nFor any of these perks to kick in though, you need to buy it directly from the resort / lodge or whatever itself and a third party purchase like a Costco one is probably not going to work (plus wasn\u2019t made on her card).", "In that scenario, not only did OP get her a cheaper ticket, she also saved her on interest.

That\u2019s enough of a reason in my book I was just making a suggestion as to why someone might be annoyed and prefer on-site purchasing. It wasn\u2019t something I would have thought of until recently when I realized how many benefits and perks associated with credit cards I have that I\u2019ve just never used and I thought others might also be the same. \n\nBut if you\u2019re point is that it would\u2019ve been easy to communicate that to op well it\u2019s a two way street. It would\u2019ve also been just as easy for op to communicate that she saw this deal and ask if her friend was interested before purchasing it initially.

Instead of sending a photo of the receipt without any context or a conversation about reimbursement at least (like hey will send you a venmo request / a copy of the receipt for the amount) op could\u2019ve communicated just as easily too. Op\u2019s lack of communication is the root of the conflict.", "Then she should have no problem paying back OP and the whole \u201cshe was planning on using a credit card\u201d angle doesn\u2019t make any sense as a reason she can\u2019t repay OP", "I doubt selling the extra tickets would have been that easy; I\u2019d be deeply suspicious of a stranger trying to sell me cheap tickets to something!\n\nYes, if OP had been able to sell the tickets then it would have made sense for their friend to just buy the tickets the way she wanted.  But I can see why the friend didn\u2019t want to risk them both being out the money.", "So OP is an AH for not communicating but her friend isn\u2019t?\n\nAlso I\u2019m 99.9999% sure this explanation you\u2019ve concocted is incorrect.", "OP asked for it a week later. Someone that's waiting 10 days or 3 weeks or something (I've had a few \"no interest for 3-6 months\" periods) to get cash would still be in a situation where by card was helping.\n\nOr this person is just being obnoxious, which sounds more likely. But the incorrect presumption that this necessarily saved her from paying interest isn't necessary to make that case.", "Maybe, maybe not. They were already at the hill, customer service could verify for the buyers that the tix are legit. I get your point though, when buying concert tickets outside a venue, I've gone through the gate with the person and paid them inside.\n\nThe friend is entirely too entitled, but the OP is not without blame for failing to communicate and listening to her when she didn't react the way he expected.", "YTA.  She did not ask you to buy them.  Leave her money alone and consider this a lesson learned.", "YTA. \n\nThis could have been avoided with healthy adult communication. \n\nYou purchased the tickets without asking her. If she had not used the tickets, you\u2019d still be out the money.", "YTA for not collecting the money right away \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "ESH you don\u2019t buy something for someone in your own accord and demand payment. She didn\u2019t ask you to buy the tickets. You could have texted her from Costco letting her know about that tickets being cheaper and asked her if she wanted you to purchase and reimburse you. The way you did it comes across as controlling and pushy. Your friend is TA because she accepted the cheaper tickets and now refuses to pay for them.", "Unfortunately, you got burned by someone you thought was a friend. You were trying to do something nice and save them money but it backfired. Since technically you didn\u2019t ask for repayment prior to her using the tickets, I think you may be out of luck with reimbursement. But moving forward I would call this friendship a loss.", "NTA - Your friend used the tickets and then won't pay you?? Complete AH. Ye were going skiing, not too out of the ordinary if someone buys cheap tickets", "YTA she never asked you to buy the tickets. The fact that your tickets were cheaper is neither here nor there. You overstepped in the most condescending way possible.", "Esh. You don\u2019t buy something that you expect to be paid back for without asking if that\u2019s ok. You also should have made it clear you expected to be paid but they should also have checked when you gave them to them", "NTA. You were all going together and saw that you could save her money. Of course, she should have paid you. How can she not see that?", "NTA \nYou would have been an asshole if she didn\u2019t CHOOSE to use them after going to the booth! \nYou did take a risk of eating the money had she chosen to continue with the tickets from the booth. If you asked her for money and she didn\u2019t use them, yes you\u2019re an AH, however, she had the opportunity to  decline. \nI would have been happy that you were thoughtful enough to think of me. If I didn\u2019t want to pay you back I would have bought tickets from the booth. That\u2019s just me.  To each his own, I guess.", "I was prepared to say otherwise because I was imagining you buying her say, a ski jacket or something. And I agree with others that you should always check with someone before buying something if it is not a gift and you want to be reimbursed.\n\nHowever. If it was more beneficial for her to buy the tickets there, she would have bought them there. Yours were clearly the better deal, so she took those. So, she should pay you back. She had planned to buy tickets, and took yours bc the price was better. She should certainly pay you back once you asked bc she did use them and you saved her money (assuming it was the exact same product etc).\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t pay you, realIze she probably isn\u2019t a good friend. I can\u2019t imagine doing this to one of my friends.  \n\nNTA", "I was reading the comments but yeah, YTA.\n\nYes, technically, you saved your friend money... BUT...\n\nWhy didn't you call/text before purchasing?\n\nWhat if all of a sudden she couldn't go anymore and didn't have time to tell you?\n\nWhy not talk about her paying you back earlier?\n\nSo yeah, YTA. You don't spend money for people unless they've agreed directly.", "Maybe she thought the tickets were a gift. If someone gave me something I didn\u2019t ask them to buy, I would likely think it was a gift. I would be upset if they later asked me to pay them back. The bottom line is you should have checked with her before you bought them. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say YTA because she obviously was prepared to spend money on tickets and, even if she thought they were a gift, she should have offered to repay you the cost of the tickets.", "Yta", "YTA\n\nThere was no agreement that you would buy the tickets, and that your friend would pay you back. \n\nYou did so at your own choice. Learn to live with your decision. No body ever responds the way we expect them to.", "ESH, you shouldn't have bought the tickets without calling her first and working it out ahead of time, they are AHs because you saved them money, and they still took advantage of you.", "ESH. Could you not call/text her before buying the tickets?", "Yta you chose to buy the tickets without asking her was it ok or if she would be willing to pay you back your fault", "NTA - she accepted them and used them. I dont see why she wasnt expecting to pay for them. You did a nice thing and it wasnt explicitly a gift.\n\nYour friends right, and she was going to need a pass soooo. Imo she should just pay and say thanks for getting.me the discount.\n\nHowever you could have called and asked for sure.", "A lot of these comments confuse me so here's my take. \n\nYou 100% should have communicated the cheaper tickets better, and your expectation to get paid back in some form. \n\nBut your friend is also an ass for not realizing you saved them some really solid money. Especially since it's Vail resorts and they are just expensive to go to in general. (Food+some resorts have paid parking+day tickets. Not to mention first time so rental costs) \nOdds are you would have saved them money on lunch with your Epic pass too(this is an assumption)\n\nI'm ultimately gonna go with NTA and your friend is the asshole because of her reaction to the phone call. She hung up and ghosted you like a child. She skied on tickets you bought them and as an adult should be capable of realizing the communication fuck up. If she sticks to the guns of \"oh you didn't communicate this prior so I don't owe you\" she's not a real friend. Any real friend would be stepping to pay you back for a favor.", "I do agree but the friend could have refused the tickets if they wanted. They chose to take them and then refused to pay", "But the friend could have just said no I don't want them I've sorted it out myself thanks. They took the ticket and then didn't pay so friend is AH", "Exactly, the friend is a nasty piece of work. OP has learned that they're not a friend of theirs", "The friend USED the tickets", "I mean, you can expect all you want, doesn't mean anyone has to give a crap\n\n>I do my thing and you do your thing.\nI am not in this world to live up to your expectations,\nAnd you are not in this world to live up to mine.\nYou are you, and I am I, and if by chance we find each other, it's beautiful.\nIf not, it can't be helped.\n\nFritz Perls", "You're assuming that the friend has the means to pay back the cost of the tickets. She could have planned to put it on the credit card, or use a fitness benefit from work, or use points.", "So? They probably thought OP was just being nice", "I would have been thrilled that a friend was thinking of me to get me a good deal on something they knew I would need to buy.", "I mean yeah\u2026when your lack of communication is quite literally the root of the problem and you caused all the tension then yeah you\u2019re more an Ah. The friend should\u2019ve magically known that op was going to or had done this and known to communicate to op not to go and buy something op was not asked to purchase ? \n\nYou\u2019re also reading a lot of assumptions into what I said that just aren\u2019t there. But sure - under your hypo where my suggestion which was more about why op should\u2019ve just asked before buying because here\u2019s this one reason I wouldn\u2019t have thought about until recently - op would still be in the wrong. Because you\u2019re basically saying the friend sucks for not predicting that she needed to tell op not to buy something she didn\u2019t want op yo because of credit card perks before she had any way of knowing op made this purchase already. \n\nI have no idea if this is the case for op and her issue and never actually even said it was. I commented specifically in response to someone else\u2019s comment about a credit card. I just  thought it was interesting that I had found this perk on mine recently and brought it up. I didn\u2019t even give a judgment and nor did I say this is probably what happened. It\u2019s one explanation that could apply but I\u2019m not claiming it does nor did I say anything else in the post suggests that it\u2019s true\u2026\n\nBut sounds like you and op are two of a confrontational kind so maybe y\u2019all can go skiing next time Costco has a deal.", "I don't think the friend is an AH for not communicating simply because she didn't ask for OP to do anything. The friend shouldn't have to explain her decision making process, considering that OP wouldn't have even been involved in if not for deciding to make this purchase without asking.", "She's not your friend.", "NTA - your simple way out is this: MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!  Next time they pay full price.", "NTA. Your friend is taking advantage of you, they are no longer friends at this point.", "NTA. Look at this as the cost of getting a shitty person out of your life. Now all you have to do is bring up she owes you money and she will disappear. But use your words.", "NTA.  How did she think she would get up the mountain?  Unless she wasn\u2019t planning on skiing when your tix were valid, she should pay you back. In the future, don\u2019t spend other people\u2019s money.", "ESH. You should have called or texted her before buying the tickets. That way there wouldn't be doubt. And if she had to pay more it was her choice.", "You tried to do a nice thing for your friend and got a shitty response instead of a reasonable one. Your friend is mostly TA imo, but since you did buy them without confirming first that she wanted you to and would reimburse you, I think the necessary ruling is ESH. I'm sorry your friend is being a jerk", "It sounds like your friend doesn\u2019t even like you. I wouldn\u2019t hang with someone who acted like that. I\u2019m curious as to why you didn\u2019t talk to her about the passes you bought her ahead of time though?", "ESH - you shouldn\u2019t have just bought them on your own.  You should have texted her that Costco had the lift tickets for $X which is cheaper than buying them at the place and ask if she wanted you to to buy them.  She is the AH for not reimbursing you because she did end up using the tickets.  Had she had not used yours and then bought her own there, then she would be under no obligation to reimburse you.", "From now on don\u2019t try to save her money. \n\nI\u2019d gladly reimburse a friend who saved me money by planning ahead. She\u2019s totally cheating out and taking advantage. Pretty sure she\u2019s not a friend. \n\nNTA", "Nta, with friendship you expect a level of trust and I know if a friend bought me something as a money saving favour I would of course reimburse them, what would genuinely be a good reason not to?\n\nShe is petty and a poor friend, sorry OP. You are not weird for expecting her to be a decent normal person!", "Idk because don\u2019t buy anything for somebody that they didn\u2019t ask for because now you\u2019re out of all that money so you basically got them a free skii trip so don\u2019t expect to get your money back you should of asked in the first place", "Yta (albeit with good intentions), never spend someone elses money without consent.", "YTA because in the very last sentences you say \u201cbecause she bought tickets in advanced she isn\u2019t obligated to pay..\u201d so she already had tickets and she forfeited them to use your Costco tickets? She planned ahead for herself and her bf, got her own tickets, and now she needs to pay you for your decision?", "NTA I was all set to blame you bc you don\u2019t normally buy things for people without asking, but this makes sense. You bought her something she would have HAD to buy anyway and you saved her money doing it. So rather than be appreciative of that she sounds like a horrible friend who likes to freeload so maybe consider not hanging out with her so much anymore, or definitely not going out of your way to offer anything up front.", "NTA. I would really appreciate such gestures from a friend.\n\nYour friend is obviously trying to take advantage of you by giving you such excuses. If she refuses the tickets there and then, and bought new ones that she wanted so much from the ticket booth, I would\u2019ve been more understanding. \n\nShe\u2019s not a friend. Take it as a lesson & leave the friendship.", "NTA it was nice of you to try to save you them money,  if you were my friend I'd be grateful and would've expected to pay you back,  in the future don't do this person favors.", "NTA\n\nIf for some reason she couldn't use the tickets, then she wouldn't have to reimburse you. However since she actually used the tickets you paid for, she should reimburse you. She literally could have decided to pay more at the desk to spite you but chose not to. \n\nOnce she had full use of the tickets she had a legal obligation to pay you since she got full value from the tickets. Ethically she also should repay you.\n\nOf course in the future, you should text or make a phone call before purchasing on behalf of anyone except possibly your spouse with whom you share finances. If someone doesn't response in a timely manner then don't make the purchase\n\nIf you were demanding payment for tickets she didn't use then you would be an ass but since she used the tickets you were a bit imprudent to risk it but that doesn't make you an ass for expecting payment as most people would in the circumstances where the person was saved money and got full value from your thoughtfulness.", "Yep, Use Your Words. This could have been avoided if you had done that in the first place and asked if she wanted you to grab the Tix for them.
