You know him better, do you think he'd actually NOT bring her if you asked? Have you tried to have a conversation about it? Have you talked to the baby's mom? Most new moms won't want their baby, at two months, to be out and about and surrounded by strangers at a party, with all the germs.\n\nDo his parents even know? Is he planning on hiding it from them, denying them the chance to meet her until he can go full attention hog?\n\nYou have some options. \n\nTalk to the mom, and tell her he is using the baby as an attention prop and bringing it out to be passed around at YOUR baby shower. It's likely she's already had one, and he's jealous, OR they don't have enough friends to warrant one, and he is trying for not only attention, but a money grab.\n\n\nWhat you might do, is ask him if he has any pics of her :D Whether he does or not, post a CONGRATULATIONS on social media. Tag all the family. Tell him you can't wait to meet the new member of the family. Ask when he's going to have a party for her to introduce her? Will it be his parents, him and baby's mom hosting, and when/where/time it will be!\n\nNot the best idea, was it?\n\nYou might consider calling his parents and congratulating them on being new grandparents.

Different people and families and cultures have different view on this. I know the most common sentiment here and in the US it seems is that THIS IS YOUR DAY, YOU SHOULDN'T SHARE IT, but in my family for example and my culture, good news are for sharing and celebrations are a chance to share the joy and love and excitement. Love isn't finite amount to hoard it. It is a chance for both young parents to connect with each other as well, maybe bond over their children being same age, foster some future playdates or events. This is especially true when families live so far away that it is complicated to organize a get-together often enough to give these news separately. \n\nAll I am saying is - there are different people, so the best OP can do is talk it through with his wife before deciding.", "I may be cynical, but I think a cousin who would ask to bring a secret baby to your shower is the same kind of cousin who would ignore a \"no\" and do it anyway. Better to be safe than sorry.", "NTA. Tell him your wife\u2019s special day is not the time nor place for his surprise kid.", "Text them the post then because they need to see what we collectively commented", "Call everyone invited to tell them about the baby, ruin the surprise.  \n\nAnd tell cousin that if he brings the new baby you will turn them away. He can visit relatives another day, not at YOUR baby shower.", "INFO \u2014 there's a story behind why no one in your family has heard about this baby yet, why your cousin reached out to YOU, and why your cousin told you they were bringing the baby rather than asked whether it was okay. How much of that do you know? \n\nThis baby could be your future baby's best bud.

Aka attention on her. Aka he\u2019s aware that a random baby showing up would be quite the scene stealer and she wouldn\u2019t like it. \n\nWife also shouldn\u2019t have to say she\u2019s upset. He can probably tell from her vibe and body language. How can she ban a baby from a baby shower and not lowkey be the bad guy? Like oh a baby\u2019s gonna upstage you you\u2019re worried about that?\n\nMe personally I would outright say ya don\u2019t come it\u2019s my day I\u2019m the pregnant one and we\u2019re celebrating me, you can have any other day of any other speck in time to announce your child to everyone, not this day. But I\u2019m a little more aggressive than most people. So therefore op just needs to step up for his wife", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019d put anything past a cousin who would even have a secret baby tbh", "Thank you! Someone with reason finally", "Just text them what I commented below", "No, he shouldn\u2019t mention the baby to anyone. As far as anyone knows the baby does not exist until after his and wife\u2019s baby shower. If cousin chooses to announce it before then, then whatever, but this weekend is about op\u2019s baby", "Ya the story is probably that cousin knocked up some random and didn\u2019t tell anyone. So now he wants to announce it at someone else\u2019s event where everyones there and has to be polite and nice so he doesn\u2019t get scolded or freaked out at by the parents probably", "\u201cHey sorry cousin we\u2019d appreciate if you didn\u2019t announce your new baby at OUR first baby shower. If you can\u2019t get a sitter we understand if you can\u2019t come. Can\u2019t wait to catch up another time\u201d\n\nEasy", "To be fair in my culture we don't throw baby showers, definitely not before the baby is born. All sort of gifts and so on that you would give a young expecting couple, friends and family usually give separately in advance or right after they are notified the baby has arrived. So the idea that you are throwing a celebration for an event that hasn't occurred yet is a bit weird to me.", "It will be OP'S DAY Only if they can keep cousin from showing up. Otherwise cousin and gift-giving relatives will make the day about cousin.\n\nHow do you propose that OP makes sure that attention stays on Op and her baby?", "Do you guys not have bridal showers either? It\u2019s basically just a fun gathering where people bring gifts to help the couple prepare for the baby and play games and eat food. It\u2019s supposed to be fun", "I mean phones exist? Call cousin? Say \u201chey if you value our relationship at all you won\u2019t do this grand reveal at my event?. So either baby stays with it\u2019s mom and you come alone or you don\u2019t come at all.\u201d\n\nHopefully cousin isn\u2019t so hellbent on this idea, hopefully he was just like \u201chey maybe this will be fun\u201d not thinking that this is a big deal to ops wife. Hopefully he can see reason and isn\u2019t a total asshole about it. \n\nBecause who crashes a baby shower with another baby after being specifically told not to? Like that\u2019s clinical. \n\nIt would be a good movie plot I guess but let\u2019s remember this is real life. COMMUNICATE WITH THE COUSIN OP ITS NOT THAT HARD. If he\u2019s a dick about it say ok don\u2019t come, inform one or two key other cousins to be like lowkey security and deal with it if he does show up", "No bridal showers, we do have hen and stag nights tho, but I think that is more of an import from US/media. The gifts are usually given at the wedding reception or afterwards directly to the couple.\n\nWe do have celebration for new babies, but it is 40 days after the baby is born. It is a bit out-dated tradition that involves only the female relatives and friends and any children (either gender) that they bring to the party. My culture used to be very patriarchal in the old days, so usually if you have guests the woman would be expected to take care of everything and serve the guests. So after a baby is born there was a 40 day \"ban\" to visit that newborn's house unless you were a female relative (because they would be helping the young mom with the chores and the baby and not require her to serve them). So after those 40 days are done, the grandmas would throw a party to introduce their grandchild to the larger family/friends and their children, on which party you usually bring gifts and there are games with the other children or the adults trying to give wishes for the baby's future and fortune. Nowadays it might be that the male relatives would attend too, maybe. Although usually they would be celebrating in a different place after dropping off their wives/children ;)"]}
