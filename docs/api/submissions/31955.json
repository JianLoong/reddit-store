Both my parents and hers refuse to help us anymore.\n\nI have worked my whole adult life and have brought the most money in. My wife has not worked and took from her parents until they said no more. We were close to being homeless when my wife reached out to a long lost friend from way back. She asked for a place to stay for a while. The friend was hesitant but laid down some rules, along with a deadline on when she expected us out. So now it's said friend, her husband, their two young children and us, along with our child in this house.\n\nMy wife has already broken one of the big rules and her friend says she gets two more strikes. \n\nWell today my wife upset her friend and the husband again. Her friend had made a personal joke to her husband that my wife overheard and took great offense to it. She was hysterical, yelling at her friend, claiming she was cruel and insensitive. I was walking in from my shift and told her to shut up (I apologized for that, as it was an awful thing to say - I'm just frustrated asf lately). She ran to our bedroom. I followed and told her I was sorry, but she needs to learn to keep it shut with certain things or else we would be homeless.\n\nShe called me a couple names, kicked me out, so now I'm on the couch. Her friend told me what happened (the joke was obviously very personal and with context it made sense - context my wife was actually aware of). She said understood we were in an awful position, she didn't want to kick us out due to the weather, but if there was any other option we had at this point because my wife is making her feel like a prisoner in her own home.\n\nMy wife won't let me into the bedroom, so I text her we're on very thin ice.
