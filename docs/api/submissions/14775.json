You are both wrong for allowing him to scalp the tickets. You are the reason there are issues with ticket sales.", "ESH... Scalpers are the worst and so are you both", "ESH and it\u2019s hilarious you\u2019re trying to pin the scalping on him because he sold the tickets when you\u2019ve clearly gone along with the plan. Do what you want but you\u2019re also an AH.", "YTA.\n\nI genuinely dislike people like you. Like, it's so slimy to do what you did. So just in general, for the entire situation, YTA.", "You both are AH. Scalping is disgusting, and you are feeding this not just once, certainly twice, maybe thrice. And this is just for one concert. I am pretty sure you both would do this again and again , should the opportunity arise.\n\nYou price out people that would love to go to concerts. Hopefully this will come back to haunt you someday.", "ESH. Your boyfriend sucks but you are both scalpers. Stop letting your boyfriend sell YOUR tickets.", "ESH people like you and your husband are why ticket prices are so ridiculous to begin with. I\u2019d love to go as I\u2019ve been a fan of Taylor since her first single dropped but can\u2019t fathom having to spend $1,000 per ticket. That\u2019s literally a month\u2019s rent for me. Insane.", "As a Swifty I'm appalled you would take advantage of other fans but whatever.\n\nIf you want to go, go. If you want to make money, sell.", "You both suck and seem to deserve each other.", "ESH for repeatedly scalping regardless of your decision to do so a third time.\n\nIt'd be better to go, because you're doing less scalping, but the question of your finances vs. the experience is kind of moot here.", "Esh you and hubby are the reason people have issues getting concrete tickets.  I also hope you're planning on reporting that earned income on your taxes!", "ESH  \n\n\nyall are the reason ticket prices are so high/tickets are hard to come by. scalpers (i.e you and your husband) are sleeazy as hell. just go to the fkn concert so someone else doenst get ripped off by you and your shitty husband", "ESH, and I think Taylor would be very disappointed in both of you.", "It was greed to resell the first pair for more than you paid for. \nJust face it now : you are not going to see the show because it will always be an opportunity cost to go see the concert instead of reselling the tickets.\nUnless you by the pair yourself for 2200$\nESH", "Coming from someone who was not able to get ANY tickets and you managed to get 3 and sold them ALL for profit instead of face value (you're part of the problem) YTA", "ESH. Tickets aren\u2019t a business opportunity. Congrats on being a \u201cfan\u201d who takes advantage of other fans. I don\u2019t give a crap about Swift, but I do care about scalpers like you and your husband making it impossible for people to get tickets at a sane price.", "ESH, you have to know scalping tickets is wrong and the reason why so many people can\u2019t go that want to.", "YTA just because people are willing to pay doesn't mean that what you're doing is OK.\n\nthe universe is telling you that taylor fans will pay anything to see her in concert. do you even like her? because you're not even seeing her at this point.", "Scalpers are assholes automatically, but girl if you don't want him to sell your ticket, fucking say so. Are you even a vertebrae? \"These are my tickets, I'm going, I'm not selling them. If you don't want to go, I'll invite a friend instead.\"\n\nESH.", "NTA\n\n>and he has them listed for sale for $2200/pair!\n\nWithout your consent/consultation? That would be a major a\\*\\*\\*move. He holds his wish for a future vacation against your wish for a concert. Who does this? I was at concerts, that I wouldn't exchange for any holiday in the world.\n\nYeah. It is greed on his part, and you suffer from it.", "NTA, and yes it is greed. You\u2019ve spent $1847 if I understood right, but also made back $2700 profit.\n\nThen he still wants to sell the 3rd set in spite of you being excited to go? Like that doesn\u2019t matter at all?\n\nHoney, if you can still buy $500 tickets, do, then get one and go alone. He can enjoy his sales alone, and you enjoy your concert. He already demonstrated your emotions and excitement aren\u2019t important to him, so don\u2019t pay him any mind or worry about his feelings (resentment) either.", "NTA\n\nHe already sold the other 2 pairs of tickets at a massive mark up and he knows you really want to go.\n\nWhat kind of a person is he if he places money sooooooo much higher than your happiness and is that the kind of person you want to be with?", "ESH. You for letting him sell the tickets held just for fans. Him for being a reseller.", "ESH, you both as assholes. In person scalping was and is illegal so idk why it\u2019s not stopped online.

Don\u2019t have the balls to say no to your husband? Please", "NTA. If you wanna go see the show then go. There\u2019s no need to sell every ticket you bought. \n\nThey were a Christmas gift were they not?", "ESH. I think you already know though. Using exclamation marks to show your excitement somehow makes it worse", "NTA. You already made a lot of money from it. The plan in the first case was for the two of you to go.", "NTA. My boyfriend wanted to do this with my tickets (that i worked pretty damn hard for), and I told him absolutely not. Tell him he can sell HIS ticket, but you\u2019re going and if he wants you to go alone then fine.", "NTA. Just sell his ticket and go alone.", "Unless you are financially hurting and not able to pay your bills right now, NTA.   \n\n\nNights spent at long-awaited concerts have been some of the best memories and investments of my life.", "NTA. He shouldn't be selling tickets you bought without asking you. This needs to be a joint decision. If you aren't OK with him selling the tickets, tell him to unlist them because you want to go.\n\nMy personal opinion is that if you have the chance to make that much money and you need the money, you should do it, but you didn't ask for opinions so....NTA.", "NTA. If he is that into ticket scalping he should buy his own tickets and leave your entertainment alone. But honestly he shouldnt do that.", "NTA!  You did make your money back and then some!  Go with a friend and enjoy the heck out of a great show!!!", "NAH. \n\nThis is a situation where you guys are just putting a very different value on this.  He is seeing the monetary value and how much could be done with that extra money for both of you long term.  You are seeing the emotional value of seeing one of (what I assume) is one of your favorite artists perform.  \n\nNo one is wrong (I'm not trying to debate the merits of scalping tickets), you just are coming at this in very different ways. \n\nThink about this.  Lets say there was a sports team he was very much into that you didn't care about.  And for reasons, he was able to make a huge profit on those tickets instead of going.  It wouldn't be shocking for me to you, not really caring about that game, would see how much further all of that money could go, whereas he may just want to experience it.  \n\nCould you maybe just go with a friend.  You bought your ticket, sell the other to a friend, and then its a win win.  Money has been made, and you get to see the show.", "There is no good answer here. Would you rather live with the money or the experience ? NAH.", "I got as far as \u201chubby\u201d before deciding YTA also Taylor Swift sucks and your husband was doing you a favour by selling the tickets out from under you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m ecstatic! We did it! We snagged them! Way more money than we were prepared for ($847/pair) but he decided it was my Christmas present. Yay! Then\u2026 Media blows up about the Ticketmaster crash etc etc. HE decided to get in on the \u201copportunity\u201d of making some money back and put them up on a resale site for $2400/pair. I begrudgingly agreed with the thought in the back of my mind that they wouldn\u2019t actually sell for that price but I appeased him to just float them out there. They sold. I cried. (Silly. I know) but we made money on them and let\u2019s be real, we\u2019ve not had a very good couple of years financially and it seemed like a bit of a blessing. Still, I was upset and had just come to terms with it when out of the blue I received a text message from being a verified fan that there would be a small amount of tickets previously withheld being released with a link and code. He was still asleep and I jumped into action! I grabbed a pair! Freaking amazing! $500/pair for the Thursday show! I can\u2019t believe it! I immediately wake him up and show him! He is happy for me! Then sees that it\u2019s the Thursday show and asks if there are any Friday show available. I give him my phone to begin his search via the link and code and BAM! $500/pair for Friday in an awesome section! So now we have two sets. He immediately puts the Thursday pair up for sale for $1700/pair. THEY SOLD!  So let\u2019s recap. I\u2019m a fan. Already had tickets that were a gift and then sold for $1500 profit. Second set sold for $1200 profit. Now I have my THIRD set which I feel is the universe telling me I\u2019m very fortunate to even be able to do this and he has them listed for sale for $2200/pair! AITA for wanting to call it what it is? Greed? I want to go! He says never again will we have the opportunity to get such a monetary return on something. And with the profits we can pay for some future vacations vs one night of a show. I feel like it\u2019s a lose/lose situation for both of us at this point. If we go then I feel like he will resent me during the show calling it an \u201copportunity cost\u201d. He says it will be an \u201copportunity cost\u201d of $2000 to see a Taylor Swift show. I totally disagree since we TECHNICALLY have already made our money back and then some. AITA???\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sometimes the experience is worth more than money. Tell him he can sell his ticket. You go see Taylor!", "ESH you are both scalping.

I would take the money I don\u2019t think Taylor would want either of you at her concert!", "ESH - now your the asshole that is ruining someone else\u2019s dream to see Swiftie by scalping.", "ESH. You\u2019re both complete assholes for scalping. People like you are the reason genuine fans can\u2019t get tickets for shows.

I feel sick about it, actually.", "They're not some bots buying up huge quantities of tickets to resell, which ticketmaster seems to have no issue with.

You can't just blame him for it.", "You agreed. It's you.", "Have you tried telling him no? Reminding him it was supposed to be a gift?", "The issue isn't that people are willing to pay crazy prices. It's that scalping cuts out people who aren't rich enough to drop a couple grand on a show. Scalpers aren't performing a necessary job, they're just scamming the system.", "I mean, obviously not, but for such a Swiftie this person seems to have ignored all the public condemnation of scalping, Ticketmaster, etc that's been done.", "Even worse", "This is mixed.
