Right now he genuinely feels like women aren't worth the trouble and you want to punish him for saying that? Like literally take away his birthday? He was asked sexual preference for dating and he answered, he didn't give some general \"women are AH's\" or something like that and you're ridiculous for taking that so personally when you know exactly what he meant. Apologize and give the kid back his freaking birthday before he feels like he has to walk on eggshells around women for the rest of his life. Ironically this overreacting shit is probably exactly where he was coming from with his answer so you kind of proved his point. (I AM a woman so don't even come at me trying to claim I'm some sexist guy, I'm not)", "YTA. Instead of talking to him about stereotypes and how dangerous they can be, you took your personal trigger and punished your kid for it. \n\nIf you think he\u2019s being a sexist jerk, address how that came to be and explore it. You\u2019re his mom and you\u2019re the one that supposed to guide him. \n\nBe better. He\u2019s a teen and you\u2019re a full grown adult who\u2019s supposed to be able to fully appreciate consequences.", "YTA, he is 16, kids say dumb things. This could have been a teaching moment but instead he will double down on this belief.", "YTA\n\nYou knew what he meant you just wanted to take the opportunity to embarrass him in front of his friends. \n\nWould it be considered \"sexist\" to you if you heard a female relative saying \"men aren't worth the trouble\"?", "YTA. \n\nExcellent job being the mature one. /s", "YTA.  Your son probably thinks women are not worth the trouble after watching you overreact all his life, just like now.  Correcting him is fine and necessary, but canceling his birthday party?  No wonder he said that.", "YTA & I'm bisexual & female been that way since I was 15. I 100% agree with your son, at this age I found them a hassle or guys. I'd complain to my mom she'd always laugh or tell me i get the best of both worlds.", "YTA and you\u2019re proving him right.", "YTA and as a woman, at that age I also felt the same. I am bisexual and knew this at a fairly young age. I had my entire earth shattered by a girl I would've done anything for when I was a teen. He's a normal bisexual teen going through normal bisexual teen things. Plus you proved him right.", "What a horrible mother.", "YTA - Omg what is wrong with you?  Saying \"Women aren't worth the trouble\" is referring to girls his age and a completely normal thing for boys to say.  You need a bigger self esteem and stop interjecting yourself into teenager drama.", "YTA. This is a conversation you have with your son in private to establish appropriate views of gender equality and what is sexism. That's an off-hand statement that would fit in any 2000's sitcom with a laugh track. Also there are very real differences when bisexual men date men vs women, which is a conversation worth having.", "YTA - are you sure you\u2019re 100% on board with his sexuality? Because he expressed an opinion about his sexuality and you punished him by taking away his birthday gifts. That doesn\u2019t sound like 100% on board. That also sounds like someone who came out as bisexual because it was more palatable to you than coming out as gay\u2026. Probably wrong in that, and it\u2019s a wild assumption I admit, but as a 40 year old gay man who came out in the mid-90\u2019s to my mother as bisexual (because she\u2019s always wanted grandchildren) I could be projecting. For for the record my mom is a rockstar and I couldn\u2019t be better blessed with an amazing ally. Also at 15 and just coming out, I was afraid. \n\nEither way though, HE expressed an opinion on HIS sexuality, and you punished him. That\u2019s not being an ally. That\u2019s not being \u201cok\u201d with it. Fix it and do better. You undermined his faith in you and that\u2019s something you\u2019ll either have to live with, or work to improve.\n\nEdit: apparently I can\u2019t spell worth shit.", "YTA. He\u2019s a teen. He is going to do and say stupid things. All you\u2019re doing by punishing him is ensuring he won\u2019t be honest with you. \n\nApologize for your overreaction and reinstate his party.\n\nPS-I also am a mother of grown children.", "#YTA\n\nI don\u2019t think an explanation is necessary in this case.", "YTA\n\nThat's a sentiment we ALL had as teenagers, and now at times... guys and girls, bisexual or not. All of us. Teenage boys and girls are both going through hormonal nightmares, and dating is awful at that age (and later).\n\nAnd as a bisexual man, I can tell you, dating another guy is often 100000% less complicated as a guy, and probably especially so when it comes to teenage angst and drama.\n\nWay to reinforce his views.", "YTA.\n\nYour son is a teen. What he was saying is apparent to anyone with a brain. He was saying that the guys he has dated have been quite straightforward, whereas there has been much more drama and hassle involved in dating a girl.\n\nYou decided to shoehorn yourself into his conversation and make it about you, because that's what assholes do.", "YTA. Don\u2019t be surprised when he holds the cancelled party over you for the next 50 years. Or just goes no contact.", "Yta this is a teachable moment. Parenting isn't about punishment its about teaching and guiding. You did neither.  Also you need to work on controlling your emotions.", "YTA. Embarrassment and shame punishments are an awful way to patent and just leads to more resentment from the kids being punished. In top of that, you're punishing him for realizing he has a dating preference? Why should it matter who he prefers to date as long as he's happy? Honestly, teenage girls are a nightmare, and I don't blame your son for his opinion one bit. Eventually, when he's older, he might even change his mind if he doesn't stick with his current partner. This is just going to guarantee he'll want less to do with involving you in his life when he gets out.", "YTA. Teenagers say a LOT of stupid things, especially to their friends. There are better ways to educate him on sexism.", "YTA. Your 16yr old son isn\u2019t the spokesperson for the LGBTQA community. You guys overwhelmed him with a parade of questions, that he\u2019s still trying to figure out the answers to. He\u2019s 16. And he has a 16yrs olds vocabulary\u2026.. also, your sons response was likely him testing the waters to how you would feel if he just came out as gay, and not bi. And u failed. -restart the trip, and tell your son misogyny is not a flattering colour on him, and that it makes him look fat.", "YTA.  Your son was relaxed and sharing openly about his feelings and experiences, not making a global statement about something being wrong or inferior about women.  Then to say what you did in front of his friends was also really bad.  It would have been better to bite your tongue until you could speak privately to him to express your concerns and let him respond.  I feel badly for him, tbh.  Sounds like is was going to be a cool birthday weekend.", "YTA.  Not because your opinion is wrong.  It's a punishment should fit the crime.\n\nYou made a pretty big escalation for some words he said to his friends.  It doesn't leave too much room for when he does something really bad.  At this point, if he breaks curfew you will kick him out of the house.", "YTA.  Where could he possibly have gotten the idea that women aren\u2019t worth the trouble?", "YTA. I would have mentioned that that can be a rather rude generalization to make, and that clearly women aren't all bad as you're being kind enough to throw him such an amazing bday party. But I wouldn't have cancelled it, what he said wasn't that serious.", "YTA This had nothing to do with you. This was about HIS dating experiences and how he felt. Get the f over yourself.", "YTA. You can correct your kid. Or even ask him what happened that\u2019s made him come to this conclusion. But to cancel his bday party over it\u2026 well that just further proves his point.", "YTA...are you 5? He was talking about romantically! Are you one of his romantic interests? He was having a friendly chat with his buddies and you really are gonna sit there and get offended by this harmless comment? Sounds like you kinda do \"have an issue with this.\"", "I don't understand why people are so offended by his remark that women aren't worth the trouble to date.  I am a woman, I am not offended.  I am assuming he sees differences in men and women and women are more challenging because they are different from him so harder to understand and interact with.  Of course that makes sense.  Whatever.  I guess I don't understand why it is so offensive a comment.  Who cares why he prefers to date guys?", "YTA, period", "YTA I'm a woman and I think that's an overreaction. It was a joke, not actual proof that your son is a sexist. Unless he has treated women with disrespect or constantly showed that he has a low view on women, then I think you were too harsh and assumed the worst of your son.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't just embarrass him in front of his friends. You know you are supposed to be the adult, right? If you had a problem with something he said, why not have a conversation with him. What does he mean, what were his experiences that led to his comment? \n\nBut, you chose irrational overreaction with punishment that has nothing to do with the action.\n\n Good parenting /s", "YTA, did you also punish him when he went through the \"girls are gross/have cooties!\" phase? \n\nI'm a woman,  a feminist,  I march in the street for our rights etc and I don't find what he said to be that big of an issue.   Girls his age can be ridiculously dramatic and mean,  he's probably had some bad experiences and prefers dating boys.  \n\nYou could have taken him aside and explained how his words were hurtful, but you just went full nuclear. \n\nHe's young,  he's still learning and his brain is still developing.   Help guide him, but don't act like a dictator.  You'll just push him away.\n\nETA: are you seriously going to tell me that while hanging with your female friends you've never said *anything* negative about men?  Did you jump on any of your girlfriends that did?", "YTA, you have no problem with your sons sexuality as long as he likes women more", "whoa, YTA. he's talking about his sexuality and dating preferences\u2014not about women in general, and certainly not you, his mother. you embarrassed him in a double whammy. this is a surefire way for him to be hesitant to speak to you ever again, especially about personal things. you need to apologize properly for your outburst.", "YTA: his friends had questions and he answered honestly.  Instead of privately asking him why, you automatically became TA in this situation.  He\u2019s entitled to his feelings. He didn\u2019t say he hated women, he said he basically prefers not to date them. Oh and you proved his point.  Don\u2019t see him visiting often when he gets away from you.  We\u2019re you expecting everyone to jump on your bandwagon when you basically put down a kid who is exploring his sexuality? Btw, I\u2019m a 70 yr old woman who is way more conscious of sexism against women then you likely are.", "YTA unless you are dating your son,  he's obviously talking about girls his age! Talk about overly sensitive and taking things personally.\n\nHe's a 16 year old who has his very little life experiences. This was his OPINION based on said experience.\n\nGrow the hell up!!! I would be embarrassed to have an immature mother like you.", "You\u2019re definitely the asshole here. At a base level it wouldn\u2019t have killed you to talk to him about it without his friends around, who could very well be affecting the way he answered. Also just canceling the party and calling him a sexist jerk completely misses the point of parenting, teaching children right from wrong. If you feel that strongly his answer was wrong then have a conversation, don\u2019t just did your child.", "YTA. I'm a woman, and I think you massively overreacted. Dumb drama stuff like that on your part might be one of the reasons for your son's concerns regarding women.", "Yeah, YTA. You are the parent. This is a great parenting moment that you did not take advantage of. Instead, you got flooded, lashed out at your kid, and embarrassed him in front of his buddies who are all just learning about the world.", "YTA. What on earth? Both sexes often joke that the opposite sex isn\u2019t \u201cworth it.\u201d Who cares ? It\u2019s a joke, and even if it wasn\u2019t, still who cares?\n\nSigned,\nA feminist", "Yta. Lol. Women aren't worth the trouble - woman immediately shows she's the worst. Sigh.", "So you proved him right? What do you think that will teach him?", "YTA even if what he said was sexist which in my opinion it isn't. Women are obviously more difficult to hook up with than men. I can easily understand why someone who's attracted to men and women equally would pursue the easier option.", "YTA. He is a sixteen year old boy hanging out with his friends. He was talking about 16 yr old girls not his mom. You owe your son an apology and a party!", "16yo kid: *says stupid thing about women*\n\nMom of 16yo kid: *does something to support kid's opinion of women to teach him a lesson*\n\nThis wasn't the teaching moment you thought it was.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Why did you insert yourself there? It sounds like people were pushing him to give a preference so he just said something in the moment. It's also personal. Maybe dating women really isn't as worth it to him. If you wanted a real conversation with him, you should have waited until his friends were no longer there. If you wanted to call them all out for sexist thinking, you could have done that too.", "Yta. I\u2019m a mother of adult children. \nHe\u2019s a teenager, you are his mother.\nI\u2019m sure his brain wasn\u2019t even connecting that you might be offended.\nThe brain doesn\u2019t even mature for about 5-6 more yrs.\n\nBut you are an adult and presumably have better control over your words and behavior. \nOr not because you are kinda proving his point.\nThat some women are about the drama.", "Yta. He's 16. He made a stupid comment. Instead of exploring it privately, and explaining how it made you feel, why that statement is hurtful, and sexist..... , you blew up and cancelled the party. And now he is rolling his eyes at his friends saying ,see what I mean? women are too much.  He wasn't being mean to you, just expressing his experience as a bi man In the worls.", "YTA way to prove his point by being super petty and acting your shoe size not your age.", "YTA", "YTA. He\u2019s a teenager. Teens say dumb things. All you\u2019ve done is possibly reinforce his idea of \u201cwomen not being worth the trouble\u201d, because at this point, you are the main woman role model in his life. Teens are very impressionable at this point in their life, and your actions right now can easily damage your relationship with your son for a long long time. If you really have a problem with what he said, it would have been much easier to just talk to him privately without the company of his close friends. This could have been a learning experience for him if handled well, but all you did was make him resent you.\n\nYTA for sure. I genuinely wish you luck with your situation, but the first step to resolution is admitting your own wrongdoing.", "YTA, You took that so personally and ruined his only 17th birthday over a joke relevant to their conversation, which, might I add, you were not actually a part of. Undoubtedly him and his friends are talking about it now and the only thing you should be thinking about is how you can make it up to him. Don't try to argue with your son for the sake of arguing.", "YTA and basically supported your son\u2019s dating preference. You didn\u2019t just embarrass your son, but yourself as well.  This could have been an educational / learning conversation with his friends but you wanted to start an argument and you got one.", "Way to prove your kids point.  Yta", "Yikes. Yes, YTA. That was pretty terrible, and way to reinforce his opinion of women. You could have very easily talked to him the next day without ruining both his birthday and potentially your relationship.", "YTA. Instead of finding out more about what his statement meant, instead of taking the opportunity for a teaching moment, you chose to be butthurt and petty instead. Your son is right, (some) women aren\u2019t worth the trouble.", "YTA, so you're punishing him for expressing an immature opinion, when he's an immature teenager?", "YTA... And a big one. The kid was talking to  his friends and you butted in where you didn't belong and got your panties in a twist. Newsflash: It wasn't about you. But now it is.", "Well you kind of proved his point! YTA", "YTA. Your son is a child, they say stupid stuff. You going off the deep end over an offhand comment, proving his point in the first place. You were the only adult in the room, yet your little tantrum was the most juvenile of all.", "YTA- You just confirmed his statement by taking away his birthday trip because you did not agree with what he said.", "YTA. I hate generalization, but he wasn't doing that, he referred to HIS experience, he never said that was the case for everyone. You just proved him right. I'm a bisexual woman, and I can tell you, sometimes women really aren't worth the trouble, just like you jeez", "YTA - surely you didnt actually cancel his birthday over this right? Like, you just threatened to do it? What a ridiculous over reaction", "YTA it seems like he maybe hasn't had the most pleasant experiences dating women and to him it isn't worth it to date them. Again he was talking about dating  not saying they aren't worth being around or being friends or that they're beneath him or any other way it could be taken. If he doesn't think they are worth dating then to him they aren't. That was not a personal attack on you and it's strange that you immediately took it that way. Your actions are drastic and mean", "I'm bisexual and I think men aren't worth the effort. Your son isn't necessarily being sexist, it's just easier to relate to the same sex.", "YBTA You knew what he ment, but the comment before and after you'res wasn't needed.", "So you thought you would help him make his point about women not being worth the trouble? \nI can guarantee those kids left with a lesser view on women because of you not your son. You\u2019re supposed to be guiding your son and teaching him about people. You didn\u2019t ask why he thought this way you just decided to jump in and punish him. Huge parenting fail. Do better.", "So . Yes YTA . For overreacting. The kid definitely needs checked. But you should have done that privately.  If he displayed behaviors that persisted before this then maybe???? But still he's a kid. Probably trying to look cool\n Is it right? Absolutely not and never excuse it. But there are ways to correctly teach and that isn't this", "YTA and he is absolutely 100% correct you women aren't worth the trouble congratulations on proving it to the world and to your son", "ESH. He absolutely needed to be corrected, but you should have done it with a serious, private conversation in which you could show him why it's wrong to throw around sexist comments like that. Instead, you took personal offense and snapped back, which only convinced him to believe what he said himself -- when he probably didn't even believe it at the time he said it; he just thought he was being funny. \n\n\nThis wasn't the way to handle it. It's not even that taking away his birthday party was too harsh; it's that it didn't actually teach him anything.", "I'm torn on this one. I'm leaning toward YTA in that canceling once a year special events as a punishment is generally an AH move. He absolutely needs to be corrected for what he's saying (even if he doesn't \"mean\" it and is just saying it as a poorly thought out joke), but there are other ways to do it rather than blowing up birthday plans.\n\nThat being said, I also hate supporting this crap in any way. -\\_- But I figure if I'm going to believe that taking away once a year events is an AH move, I should stick by it even if it's for something like this.\n\nEdit: BTW that judgement isn't for embarrassing him in front of his friends - good on that one.", "YTA you just proved his point and it's not like he's wrong at least anecdotally from every bi person I've talked to man or woman they say women are a lot more difficult to deal with in a relationship than a man.", "I can't believe the hypocrisy in these comments if a woman really posted \"men aren't worth the trouble of dating\" she'd get bombarded with hate comments and possibly doxxed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not a sexist jerk to say women were not worth dating in his experience and not about you.\n\nI am a woman and do not find what he said offensive. I think it was rude for you to jump into the conversation, throw a fit over a comment and cancel his birthday celebration. I think you should apologize.", "Yta.i see where he got his idea from now.  It always starts at home OP and you aren't the best role model it seems", "YTA\n\nSo, you're reacting to your son saying that \"women aren't worth the trouble\" by... being a huge bee? Yeah.... With female figures in his life like you, I won't be surprise if he just sticks with guys:/", "YTA. Why are you acting like you're 16 as well", "YTA.  So a 16 year old boy has a pretty typical 16 year old boy attitude and you chose to respond in just as juvenile of a way.  Nice parenting.  If you're this upset about what he said then you sure as shit better have NEVER uttered the words \"Men, who needs them!\"\n\nYou took something personally and really made far too much off a big deal over this.  You expect the teen to act like a teen but we'd expect a parent to act like an adult.", "Your son is 16. You\u2019re an adult.

That was a ridiculous overreaction.", "Normal People: That's kind of a harsh thing to say; did you have a bad experience with a girl that made you feel this way?

And you just proved his point.", "YTA\n\nWas your son\u2019s comment stupid and worth calling out? Yes. \n\nWas it worth cancelling his entire birthday? No. \n\nHe\u2019s a teen. His friends were hounding him with questions about his sexuality. That\u2019s likely not very comfortable and he was handling it well. They were asking to learn from him - but it\u2019s NOT his responsibility to be teaching them. \n\nYou should have text him before \u201chey \u2014 are you comfortable with this? If you\u2019re not I can actively interrupt\u201d.  Or if he isn\u2019t a texting sort you should have found a way to disrupt the conversation - if your son was actually comfortable with this and wanted to continue the convo he would have picked it up again later. \n\nChances are he may have been feeling uncomfortable. Often when we\u2019re uncomfortable and feeling trapped we end up saying stupid things - his comment, although sexist, was also a way to go \u201chey guys - I\u2019m still like you. I\u2019m still part of the group.\u201d \n\nYou failed to read the situation Op. you should have intervened before it got to that point.", "I see youre doubling down on the \"women arent worth the trouble\" thing huh lmao.

YTA!", "YTA.  And you just proved his point.   What a jerk you are!", "as much as I think he sounds like a brat, I\u2019m willing to accept that he\u2019s a teen and is still learning, but you, YTA for all of this", "YTA. He has a right to his own opinion. What he said wasn't sexist, teenaged girls can be a wreck, I know, I was one once.

You're acting more like a teenager than he is.", "YTA for sure.", "It's perfectly reasonable to believe same-sex relationships are easier when heterosexual relationships come with loads of social expectations over roles and behaviour. Besides, it was a jokey comment about *his own life*! \n\nYTA", "YTA. What an utterly unhinged overreaction.", "YTA: Under grilling from his hetero friends I\u2019m sure this was a pointed joke suggesting his life was easier not harder than theirs. A conversation about it being sexist and jerky would have been good. Cancelling an extravagant trip already planned and invites sent - wow that\u2019s an overreaction. Were you looking for an excuse to get out of paying for it?", "YTA. Whether you want him to or not, he isn't dating you.", "YTA and your reaction to what could have been a teachable moment between mother and son ended up being nothing more than the rantings of an immature woman with no personal sense of self respect.\n\nReally,??

Like other posters have said, this has obviously triggered something within you which needs to be resolved in your own time.\n\nAt 16 / 17 years old, young adults are discovering things about themselves, they're moving from childhood into adulthood and they need to have an open space to communicate feelings. In your son making this comment and you having this outburst, do you really think he'll feel comfortable coming to you in the future if he believes this is how you'll react?\n\nWe're all human, we make mistakes and can say things out of anger that can have a negative impact. If this happened with my child, I would be sitting him down and giving him a genuine apology for not only embarrassing him in front of his peers, but I would make sure that he knew that I would always be there for him if he needed to talk and that my reaction to his comment wasn't warranted.\n\nIt sounds like you already have an open communication relationship as you've mentioned he's open about being bisexual. Don't let this one instance ruin that relationship. Apologize, re plan his birthday party. The way this was handled, unfortunately YTA.", "> I asked him to explain what he meant. I told him if women aren't worth the trouble, then neither am I\n\nI wonder if she actually gave him time to explain what he meant?", "YTA, You don't ever embarrass your child especially in front of their friends. You could\u2019ve explain to him that it\u2019s not okay to (gender) stereotype others in PRIVATE, but instead you cancelled his birthday and called him a \u201csexist jerk\u201d seriously OP? That is also not okay to label others even if it\u2019s true about them. He was talking about his dating preferences not you. He is 16, you\u2019re the adult who\u2019s supposed to be fully aware of consequences and as his mom you\u2019re supposed to be the one who guides him, not the other way around", "YTA and I hope you\u2019re ready for your son to never make himself vulnerable around you again. He shared something he felt with his friends, admittedly in the form of a joke, and you went nuclear on him. \n\nWhy would he share his feelings with you now going forward?

You\u2019re supposed to challenge problematic beliefs and talk it through, not humiliate and punish him! How can he confide in you if you blow up his life every time he says something stupid? How do you know some girl hasn\u2019t really hurt him? That would have been a fantastic opportunity to have a proper discussion (once his friends had gone!) which made him see girls and women are human and as different from one another as men and boys, instead you\u2019ve just really damaged your relationship with your child.", "What does his preference in sexual intimacy or dates has to do with you? You're not a potential lover ffs.\nYtA and your reaction is very disturbing.", "Lol. You basically proved him right.\n\nYTA", "YTA.", "Wow, YTA. What an insane overreaction to a harmless joke.", "Yeah, YTA.", "[removed]", "He is talking about his own romantic entanglements with women, the fact that you are comparing yourself to teenage girls dating your son is weird. \nLike you took it personally. \nHe didn\u2019t say anything horribly disparaging about women.

A huge one.", "YTA\n\nyou realize he meant it as romantically yes?why are you so offended?", "YTA\nHe was shooting his mouth off with his friends, and likely didn\u2019t think too hard about what he said. You weren\u2019t part of the conversation and inserted yourself then we\u2019re incredibly rude. Is it something that needed to be addressed? Yes but in a private way and a heck of a lot more gently than what you did.", "I understand your impulse, but I think you could've handled it better - like actually waiting for his response / probing his thoughts further before the public shaming and punishment. He might've learned a lesson about sexism by your reaction, but it could be lost in the embarrassment / shame / anger.\n\nI would try a follow up convo, where you apologize for embarrassing him (and maybe overreacting, if you feel it was an overreaction in retrospect) and try to talk about the heart of the matter again. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nYou kind of proved his point though too.  You overreacted and caused drama.  He was having a frank discussion that didn't involve you, but then inserted yourself into.  Then became offended that he, as a bisexual guy, finds men to be easier to be in a relationship with.  Thus, proving his point.  \n\nHe wasn't being sexist.  He was stating his preferences.", "YTA.\n\nGet down from your high horse and try to listen.\n\nI\u2019m a bisexual woman in a relationship with a man and even if a love him I still feel sometimes that dating women was a little easier, using your son words \u201che is worth the trouble but it is still a lot of trouble\u201d. \n\nIt is normal, we know our body, we know our way fo thinking and expressing emotions and we have similar experience connected to our genders in the society. That is what you son did mean, something you could have understand if you had just avoid to go totally drama queen.\n\nAlso they are teens, in that period you barely understand yourself let alone understanding the opposite gender. I date a boy over 4 girls in my teens. \n\nAlso they were speaking about love/sexual relationships why would he be referring or thinking to you?\n\nApologize to him and give him is birthday back, you went totally overboard over nothing.", "You one hundred percent solidified his belief that women aren't worth the trouble. Congratulations.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nHe has the right to an opinion.

Not you. \nThere are different kinds of love and different ways to categorieze", "YTA.\n\nTotally confirmed his opinion that girls are a complete PITA.\n\nHope you weren't hoping for grandkids.", "Enjoy the year of awkward moments, angry looks, and distancing, cause you'll prolly not see him again when he turns 18. \n\nI cut off contact with my parents over them attacking me after coming out, and if you will attack him over something so minor, I can only imagine how else you attack him.", "Yta and you overrated massively. He was staying his personal preference and you turned it into a pity party for yourself as a woman, how ridiculous. You humiliated him and ruined his party, congrats.", "Wow. Are you on some power trip? \n\nAre 16-year-old boy sitting around with his male friends and makes a negative comment about women.... \n\nThat's normal. It wasn't even that disparaging. It sounds like somebody who just had a bad breakup with a girl. After a bad breakup with a guy, I often tell my friends I'm swearing off guys. I don't consider that sexist. \n\nAnd you decided to take the nuclear option of canceling his birthday weekend? The punishment doesn't fit the crime here. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Sure double down on him thinking women are difficult. \n\nHint, teen girls are very hard for teen boys to understand. Now he knows his Mom is the same.", "So basically you showed him he's right.

Do you normally jump to irrational extremes, because this behavior is honestly concerning.", "Yta\nThat was a huge overreaction to how your son feels about DATING women.", "[removed]", "YTA for overreacting. You could have used this as an opportunity for a calm discussion about why he thinks this way.", "[removed]", "Yes omg yes  YTA what an overreaction. Have some empathy and put yourself in his shoes. What 17 year old girl isn't a huge hassle (boy too?) \n\nInstead of straight up canceling his party you could have asked him what he meant by that (in private) and discussed why his thought process might have been hurtful to girls his age. But instead you just confirmed his thoughts by creating drama.", "YTA \n\nWhat a massive over reaction \n\nSounds like you do have a problem with it after all >.>", "assuming you have never dated another woman yourself, how would you know if dating a woman is difficult or easy?

Samsies.", "YTA and probably gave him another reason to believe women aren\u2019t worth the trouble. He meant romantically, not in general and you miss understood, like we usually do, and went ballistic. You are the AH mostly for canceling the birthday rather than for what you said.", "YTA. It's not a sexist thing to say women/girls are more difficult to date than men/boys. That's just simple fact. It's an entirely less complex affair when reproduction isn't on the table. He didn't say women or bad or worse or deserve less or any sexist thing, just that dating them is too difficult for him. Maybe hat's because his mother has given him the impression that women will freak the fuck out if he expresses the wrong opinion.", "YTA. You're coming down too hard on a 16 year old kid that said something stupid to show off with his friends. If I got punished every time I said something that made me sound like a jerk at that age I wouldn't have had anything. Teenagers have no impulse control. That's why we parent them. This was a teachable moment for you and you could have handled it with a discussion that he and his friends could have learned something from. Instead, you embarrassed him and took something fun away from his friends.", "YTA. Hell I'm a 39 F bisexual. Can confirm most dating, regardless of gender, is NOT worth it at that age. Have you met teenagers? Lol.", "Yta big time. If his comment bothered you, you could have chosen another moment to bring it up, not in front of his friends. This should have been a conversation, canceling his birthday was just a jerk power move and unwarranted.", "Ew you\u2019re not a good mother", "YTA. Aren\u2019t you just a real bright one /s", "I have a bisexual son... The girls he dated did him dirty. Hes now with his wonderful male fiancee, happier than i could ever have imagined.\n\nHes made comments before about girls being absolutely harder to date than men.\n\nI agreed, considering what i watched him go through with both sexes before he found Q.\n\nYou made the flippant comment about you and berated him then took away his birthday celebration because YOU got offended..\n\n\nHe isnt SEXIST, he made an observation based on his experience and answered a question.\n\n\nAre you REALLY  okay with his sexuality or did that ruin all hopes you had of him dating only girls in the future?", "Yta and immature. You could have explained to him nicely, and make him understand the problem with his statement, but nooo you just proved him right.\n\nYta a big time.", "Wow YTA. Just because he has a preference that he only expressed when HE WAS ASKED.  You\u2019re further proving his point by being that petty", "Yta. I cant see what you were hoping to achieve here. You've turned what could have been a good chance to teach your son into just proving his point that women are hard work. Congrats", "YTA he is talking to his friends why are you listening in and taking offense? Kids say something now and change their minds in the future. Girls his age in his mind are not worth the trouble and based on your reaction to his comment I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he things all women aren\u2019t worth the trouble. You could\u2019ve waited till his friends left and then asked but you made it a issue in front of his friends which makes you the AH", "Major YTA, this wasn't about you, tone it down. He talked about DATING women and you took it personally, that's a little creepy too. Aren't you curious to find out details about how he feels, what happened that made him feel that way? Do you just want to shut him up because you don't like this opinion he has?", "YTA, you validated his belief by taking something entirely too personal and blowing up. I sincerely doubt he was referring to you specifically, he was likely just trying to say his past experiences with DATING his PEERS (nothing to do with you) he doesn't prefer women. You could have pointed out to him how his phrasing might come off a bit harsh, but to nuke his whole birthday? Sounds like you're on the government funded retirement home path.", "YTA", "YTA, geesh, OP, did you flounce out of the room like a teenager too? Way to solidify the stereotype that women are moody and take things too far. Also, you embarrassed yourself even more than you embarrassed him. His friends are talking about OP\u2019s son\u2019s crazy mom for sure.", "YTA and it seems abundantly clear you're not okay with his choices. Being a good parent requires being open minded and understanding that you won't always share the same views.", "yta, that was a teaching moment, not a moment to make it about your feelings.", "YTA\n\nand proved him right.  fucks sake how can you suck at parenting this much after 17 years practice", "YTA. I'm women and therefore feminist but you are wrong here. You are his parent and you should parent him, not insult him. If you think he was offensive, talk to him in private. Also, he is allowed to have an opinion, maybe he was hurt by some woman or maybe he really find them to be more demanding. This is something you solve with conversation not by throwing fit like a toddler.", "So he's having a conversation with his friends and your response is to punish him for his experience and opinion? Interesting.\n\nWhy didn't you sit with him and have a conversation about his feelings? Again, Interesting.", "Sigh. As someone who\u2019s dated both men and women, a lot of bi people have preferences. And a lot of them might find it easier to connect to one gender over another. I think the appropriate way to handle this would\u2019ve been to have a light conversation with your son. I have a hard time believing he\u2019s seeing this as anything other than validation for his views, or punishment for his preference for men. YTA.", "Why is his parent equivocating themselves to a romantic interest? It's gross.", "While the son's phrasing is crass, a preference for dating their own gender is definitely something I have heard from people who have dated on both sides of the divide. It can just be easier to date someone who shares the same gendered life experience as you.", "YTA did you forget what high school girls are like?? Drama, gossip, backstabbing, more drama, out of whack hormones\u2026.as a female who was once in high school I agree with your 17 year old son\u2026.girls are not worth it. (At his age!!)", "Double it and give it to the next person.", "100% this kid already feels like he has to walk on eggshells around her.

What an odd thing to do. \n\nYou\u2019re also punishing him for having opinions.

It'd be pretty horrid for him to weigh up the two in front of people given he's literally dating someone from one of the two categories!", "Well, I personally don't understand how it ISN'T offensive. Imho, pretty much offensive and uncalled for. And yes, a similar comment about men I would also find absolutely NOT okay.
