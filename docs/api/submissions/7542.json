Right now he genuinely feels like women aren't worth the trouble and you want to punish him for saying that? Like literally take away his birthday? He was asked sexual preference for dating and he answered, he didn't give some general \"women are AH's\" or something like that and you're ridiculous for taking that so personally when you know exactly what he meant. Apologize and give the kid back his freaking birthday before he feels like he has to walk on eggshells around women for the rest of his life. Ironically this overreacting shit is probably exactly where he was coming from with his answer so you kind of proved his point. (I AM a woman so don't even come at me trying to claim I'm some sexist guy, I'm not)", "YTA. Instead of talking to him about stereotypes and how dangerous they can be, you took your personal trigger and punished your kid for it. \n\nIf you think he\u2019s being a sexist jerk, address how that came to be and explore it. You\u2019re his mom and you\u2019re the one that supposed to guide him. \n\nBe better. He\u2019s a teen and you\u2019re a full grown adult who\u2019s supposed to be able to fully appreciate consequences.", "YTA, he is 16, kids say dumb things. This could have been a teaching moment but instead he will double down on this belief.", "YTA\n\nYou knew what he meant you just wanted to take the opportunity to embarrass him in front of his friends. \n\nWould it be considered \"sexist\" to you if you heard a female relative saying \"men aren't worth the trouble\"?", "YTA. \n\nExcellent job being the mature one. /s", "YTA.  Your son probably thinks women are not worth the trouble after watching you overreact all his life, just like now.  Correcting him is fine and necessary, but canceling his birthday party?  No wonder he said that.", "YTA & I'm bisexual & female been that way since I was 15. I 100% agree with your son, at this age I found them a hassle or guys. I'd complain to my mom she'd always laugh or tell me i get the best of both worlds.", "YTA and you\u2019re proving him right.", "YTA and as a woman, at that age I also felt the same. I am bisexual and knew this at a fairly young age. I had my entire earth shattered by a girl I would've done anything for when I was a teen. He's a normal bisexual teen going through normal bisexual teen things. Plus you proved him right.", "What a horrible mother.", "YTA - Omg what is wrong with you?  Saying \"Women aren't worth the trouble\" is referring to girls his age and a completely normal thing for boys to say.  You need a bigger self esteem and stop interjecting yourself into teenager drama.", "YTA. This is a conversation you have with your son in private to establish appropriate views of gender equality and what is sexism. That's an off-hand statement that would fit in any 2000's sitcom with a laugh track. Also there are very real differences when bisexual men date men vs women, which is a conversation worth having.", "YTA - are you sure you\u2019re 100% on board with his sexuality? Because he expressed an opinion about his sexuality and you punished him by taking away his birthday gifts. That doesn\u2019t sound like 100% on board. That also sounds like someone who came out as bisexual because it was more palatable to you than coming out as gay\u2026. Probably wrong in that, and it\u2019s a wild assumption I admit, but as a 40 year old gay man who came out in the mid-90\u2019s to my mother as bisexual (because she\u2019s always wanted grandchildren) I could be projecting. For for the record my mom is a rockstar and I couldn\u2019t be better blessed with an amazing ally. Also at 15 and just coming out, I was afraid. \n\nEither way though, HE expressed an opinion on HIS sexuality, and you punished him. That\u2019s not being an ally. That\u2019s not being \u201cok\u201d with it. Fix it and do better. You undermined his faith in you and that\u2019s something you\u2019ll either have to live with, or work to improve.\n\nEdit: apparently I can\u2019t spell worth shit.", "YTA. He\u2019s a teen. He is going to do and say stupid things. All you\u2019re doing by punishing him is ensuring he won\u2019t be honest with you. \n\nApologize for your overreaction and reinstate his party.\n\nPS-I also am a mother of grown children.", "#YTA\n\nI don\u2019t think an explanation is necessary in this case.", "YTA\n\nThat's a sentiment we ALL had as teenagers, and now at times... guys and girls, bisexual or not. All of us. Teenage boys and girls are both going through hormonal nightmares, and dating is awful at that age (and later).\n\nAnd as a bisexual man, I can tell you, dating another guy is often 100000% less complicated as a guy, and probably especially so when it comes to teenage angst and drama.\n\nWay to reinforce his views.", "YTA.\n\nYour son is a teen. What he was saying is apparent to anyone with a brain. He was saying that the guys he has dated have been quite straightforward, whereas there has been much more drama and hassle involved in dating a girl.\n\nYou decided to shoehorn yourself into his conversation and make it about you, because that's what assholes do.", "YTA. Don\u2019t be surprised when he holds the cancelled party over you for the next 50 years. Or just goes no contact.", "Yta this is a teachable moment. Parenting isn't about punishment its about teaching and guiding. You did neither.  Also you need to work on controlling your emotions.", "YTA. Embarrassment and shame punishments are an awful way to patent and just leads to more resentment from the kids being punished. In top of that, you're punishing him for realizing he has a dating preference? Why should it matter who he prefers to date as long as he's happy? Honestly, teenage girls are a nightmare, and I don't blame your son for his opinion one bit. Eventually, when he's older, he might even change his mind if he doesn't stick with his current partner. This is just going to guarantee he'll want less to do with involving you in his life when he gets out.", "YTA. Teenagers say a LOT of stupid things, especially to their friends. There are better ways to educate him on sexism.", "YTA. Your 16yr old son isn\u2019t the spokesperson for the LGBTQA community. You guys overwhelmed him with a parade of questions, that he\u2019s still trying to figure out the answers to. He\u2019s 16. And he has a 16yrs olds vocabulary\u2026.. also, your sons response was likely him testing the waters to how you would feel if he just came out as gay, and not bi. And u failed. -restart the trip, and tell your son misogyny is not a flattering colour on him, and that it makes him look fat.", "YTA.  Your son was relaxed and sharing openly about his feelings and experiences, not making a global statement about something being wrong or inferior about women.  Then to say what you did in front of his friends was also really bad.  It would have been better to bite your tongue until you could speak privately to him to express your concerns and let him respond.  I feel badly for him, tbh.  Sounds like is was going to be a cool birthday weekend.", "YTA.  Not because your opinion is wrong.  It's a punishment should fit the crime.\n\nYou made a pretty big escalation for some words he said to his friends.  It doesn't leave too much room for when he does something really bad.  At this point, if he breaks curfew you will kick him out of the house.", "YTA.  Where could he possibly have gotten the idea that women aren\u2019t worth the trouble?", "YTA. I would have mentioned that that can be a rather rude generalization to make, and that clearly women aren't all bad as you're being kind enough to throw him such an amazing bday party. But I wouldn't have cancelled it, what he said wasn't that serious.", "YTA This had nothing to do with you. This was about HIS dating experiences and how he felt. Get the f over yourself.", "YTA. You can correct your kid. Or even ask him what happened that\u2019s made him come to this conclusion. But to cancel his bday party over it\u2026 well that just further proves his point.", "YTA...are you 5? He was talking about romantically! Are you one of his romantic interests? He was having a friendly chat with his buddies and you really are gonna sit there and get offended by this harmless comment? Sounds like you kinda do \"have an issue with this.\"", "I don't understand why people are so offended by his remark that women aren't worth the trouble to date.  I am a woman, I am not offended.  I am assuming he sees differences in men and women and women are more challenging because they are different from him so harder to understand and interact with.  Of course that makes sense.  Whatever.  I guess I don't understand why it is so offensive a comment.  Who cares why he prefers to date guys?", "YTA, period", "YTA I'm a woman and I think that's an overreaction. It was a joke, not actual proof that your son is a sexist. Unless he has treated women with disrespect or constantly showed that he has a low view on women, then I think you were too harsh and assumed the worst of your son.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't just embarrass him in front of his friends. You know you are supposed to be the adult, right? If you had a problem with something he said, why not have a conversation with him. What does he mean, what were his experiences that led to his comment? \n\nBut, you chose irrational overreaction with punishment that has nothing to do with the action.\n\n Good parenting /s", "YTA, did you also punish him when he went through the \"girls are gross/have cooties!\" phase? \n\nI'm a woman,  a feminist,  I march in the street for our rights etc and I don't find what he said to be that big of an issue.   Girls his age can be ridiculously dramatic and mean,  he's probably had some bad experiences and prefers dating boys.  \n\nYou could have taken him aside and explained how his words were hurtful, but you just went full nuclear. \n\nHe's young,  he's still learning and his brain is still developing.   Help guide him, but don't act like a dictator.  You'll just push him away.\n\nETA: are you seriously going to tell me that while hanging with your female friends you've never said *anything* negative about men?  Did you jump on any of your girlfriends that did?", "YTA, you have no problem with your sons sexuality as long as he likes women more", "whoa, YTA. he's talking about his sexuality and dating preferences\u2014not about women in general, and certainly not you, his mother. you embarrassed him in a double whammy. this is a surefire way for him to be hesitant to speak to you ever again, especially about personal things. you need to apologize properly for your outburst.", "YTA: his friends had questions and he answered honestly.  Instead of privately asking him why, you automatically became TA in this situation.  He\u2019s entitled to his feelings. He didn\u2019t say he hated women, he said he basically prefers not to date them. Oh and you proved his point.  Don\u2019t see him visiting often when he gets away from you.  We\u2019re you expecting everyone to jump on your bandwagon when you basically put down a kid who is exploring his sexuality? Btw, I\u2019m a 70 yr old woman who is way more conscious of sexism against women then you likely are.", "YTA unless you are dating your son,  he's obviously talking about girls his age! Talk about overly sensitive and taking things personally.\n\nHe's a 16 year old who has his very little life experiences. This was his OPINION based on said experience.\n\nGrow the hell up!!! I would be embarrassed to have an immature mother like you.", "You\u2019re definitely the asshole here. At a base level it wouldn\u2019t have killed you to talk to him about it without his friends around, who could very well be affecting the way he answered. Also just canceling the party and calling him a sexist jerk completely misses the point of parenting, teaching children right from wrong. If you feel that strongly his answer was wrong then have a conversation, don\u2019t just did your child.", "YTA. I'm a woman, and I think you massively overreacted. Dumb drama stuff like that on your part might be one of the reasons for your son's concerns regarding women.", "Yeah, YTA. You are the parent. This is a great parenting moment that you did not take advantage of. Instead, you got flooded, lashed out at your kid, and embarrassed him in front of his buddies who are all just learning about the world.", "YTA. What on earth? Both sexes often joke that the opposite sex isn\u2019t \u201cworth it.\u201d Who cares ? It\u2019s a joke, and even if it wasn\u2019t, still who cares?\n\nSigned,\nA feminist", "Yta. Lol. Women aren't worth the trouble - woman immediately shows she's the worst. Sigh.", "So you proved him right? What do you think that will teach him?", "YTA even if what he said was sexist which in my opinion it isn't. Women are obviously more difficult to hook up with than men. I can easily understand why someone who's attracted to men and women equally would pursue the easier option.", "YTA. He is a sixteen year old boy hanging out with his friends. He was talking about 16 yr old girls not his mom. You owe your son an apology and a party!", "16yo kid: *says stupid thing about women*\n\nMom of 16yo kid: *does something to support kid's opinion of women to teach him a lesson*\n\nThis wasn't the teaching moment you thought it was.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Why did you insert yourself there? It sounds like people were pushing him to give a preference so he just said something in the moment. It's also personal. Maybe dating women really isn't as worth it to him. If you wanted a real conversation with him, you should have waited until his friends were no longer there. If you wanted to call them all out for sexist thinking, you could have done that too.", "Yta. I\u2019m a mother of adult children. \nHe\u2019s a teenager, you are his mother.\nI\u2019m sure his brain wasn\u2019t even connecting that you might be offended.\nThe brain doesn\u2019t even mature for about 5-6 more yrs.\n\nBut you are an adult and presumably have better control over your words and behavior. \nOr not because you are kinda proving his point.\nThat some women are about the drama.", "Yta. He's 16. He made a stupid comment. Instead of exploring it privately, and explaining how it made you feel, why that statement is hurtful, and sexist..... , you blew up and cancelled the party. And now he is rolling his eyes at his friends saying ,see what I mean? women are too much.  He wasn't being mean to you, just expressing his experience as a bi man In the worls.", "YTA way to prove his point by being super petty and acting your shoe size not your age.", "YTA", "YTA. He\u2019s a teenager. Teens say dumb things. All you\u2019ve done is possibly reinforce his idea of \u201cwomen not being worth the trouble\u201d, because at this point, you are the main woman role model in his life. Teens are very impressionable at this point in their life, and your actions right now can easily damage your relationship with your son for a long long time. If you really have a problem with what he said, it would have been much easier to just talk to him privately without the company of his close friends. This could have been a learning experience for him if handled well, but all you did was make him resent you.\n\nYTA for sure. I genuinely wish you luck with your situation, but the first step to resolution is admitting your own wrongdoing.", "YTA, You took that so personally and ruined his only 17th birthday over a joke relevant to their conversation, which, might I add, you were not actually a part of. Undoubtedly him and his friends are talking about it now and the only thing you should be thinking about is how you can make it up to him. Don't try to argue with your son for the sake of arguing.", "YTA and basically supported your son\u2019s dating preference. You didn\u2019t just embarrass your son, but yourself as well.  This could have been an educational / learning conversation with his friends but you wanted to start an argument and you got one.", "Way to prove your kids point.  Yta", "Yikes. Yes, YTA. That was pretty terrible, and way to reinforce his opinion of women. You could have very easily talked to him the next day without ruining both his birthday and potentially your relationship.", "YTA. Instead of finding out more about what his statement meant, instead of taking the opportunity for a teaching moment, you chose to be butthurt and petty instead. Your son is right, (some) women aren\u2019t worth the trouble.", "YTA, so you're punishing him for expressing an immature opinion, when he's an immature teenager?", "YTA... And a big one. The kid was talking to  his friends and you butted in where you didn't belong and got your panties in a twist. Newsflash: It wasn't about you. But now it is.", "Well you kind of proved his point! YTA", "YTA. Your son is a child, they say stupid stuff. You going off the deep end over an offhand comment, proving his point in the first place. You were the only adult in the room, yet your little tantrum was the most juvenile of all.", "YTA- You just confirmed his statement by taking away his birthday trip because you did not agree with what he said.", "YTA. I hate generalization, but he wasn't doing that, he referred to HIS experience, he never said that was the case for everyone. You just proved him right. I'm a bisexual woman, and I can tell you, sometimes women really aren't worth the trouble, just like you jeez", "YTA - surely you didnt actually cancel his birthday over this right? Like, you just threatened to do it? What a ridiculous over reaction", "YTA it seems like he maybe hasn't had the most pleasant experiences dating women and to him it isn't worth it to date them. Again he was talking about dating  not saying they aren't worth being around or being friends or that they're beneath him or any other way it could be taken. If he doesn't think they are worth dating then to him they aren't. That was not a personal attack on you and it's strange that you immediately took it that way. Your actions are drastic and mean", "I'm bisexual and I think men aren't worth the effort. Your son isn't necessarily being sexist, it's just easier to relate to the same sex.", "YBTA You knew what he ment, but the comment before and after you'res wasn't needed.", "So you thought you would help him make his point about women not being worth the trouble? \nI can guarantee those kids left with a lesser view on women because of you not your son. You\u2019re supposed to be guiding your son and teaching him about people. You didn\u2019t ask why he thought this way you just decided to jump in and punish him. Huge parenting fail. Do better.", "So . Yes YTA . For overreacting. The kid definitely needs checked. But you should have done that privately.  If he displayed behaviors that persisted before this then maybe???? But still he's a kid. Probably trying to look cool\n Is it right? Absolutely not and never excuse it. But there are ways to correctly teach and that isn't this", "YTA and he is absolutely 100% correct you women aren't worth the trouble congratulations on proving it to the world and to your son", "ESH. He absolutely needed to be corrected, but you should have done it with a serious, private conversation in which you could show him why it's wrong to throw around sexist comments like that. Instead, you took personal offense and snapped back, which only convinced him to believe what he said himself -- when he probably didn't even believe it at the time he said it; he just thought he was being funny. \n\n\nThis wasn't the way to handle it. It's not even that taking away his birthday party was too harsh; it's that it didn't actually teach him anything.", "I'm torn on this one. I'm leaning toward YTA in that canceling once a year special events as a punishment is generally an AH move. He absolutely needs to be corrected for what he's saying (even if he doesn't \"mean\" it and is just saying it as a poorly thought out joke), but there are other ways to do it rather than blowing up birthday plans.\n\nThat being said, I also hate supporting this crap in any way. -\\_- But I figure if I'm going to believe that taking away once a year events is an AH move, I should stick by it even if it's for something like this.\n\nEdit: BTW that judgement isn't for embarrassing him in front of his friends - good on that one.", "YTA you just proved his point and it's not like he's wrong at least anecdotally from every bi person I've talked to man or woman they say women are a lot more difficult to deal with in a relationship than a man.", "I can't believe the hypocrisy in these comments if a woman really posted \"men aren't worth the trouble of dating\" she'd get bombarded with hate comments and possibly doxxed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do you know how easy you've made it for him to be sucked into misogynistic circles after this incident?", "YTA\nHe was talking about his experiences dating girls\u2026 romantic relationships as a teenager. Not a sexist jerk to say women were not worth dating in his experience and not about you.\n\nI am a woman and do not find what he said offensive. I think it was rude for you to jump into the conversation, throw a fit over a comment and cancel his birthday celebration. I think you should apologize.", "Yta.i see where he got his idea from now.  It always starts at home OP and you aren't the best role model it seems", "YTA\n\nSo, you're reacting to your son saying that \"women aren't worth the trouble\" by... being a huge bee? Yeah.... With female figures in his life like you, I won't be surprise if he just sticks with guys:/", "YTA. Why are you acting like you're 16 as well", "YTA.  So a 16 year old boy has a pretty typical 16 year old boy attitude and you chose to respond in just as juvenile of a way.  Nice parenting.  If you're this upset about what he said then you sure as shit better have NEVER uttered the words \"Men, who needs them!\"\n\nYou took something personally and really made far too much off a big deal over this.  You expect the teen to act like a teen but we'd expect a parent to act like an adult.", "Your son is 16. You\u2019re an adult. YTA and you should be ashamed of yourself.", "You're the asshole.", "YTA. That was a ridiculous overreaction.", "Normal People: That's kind of a harsh thing to say; did you have a bad experience with a girl that made you feel this way? I'm curious if you don't mind my asking\n\nOP: I'M A WOMEN BIRTHDAY BANNED!!!11!! \n\nYTA. A dramatic one, too.", "YTA. And you just proved his point.", "YTA\n\nWas your son\u2019s comment stupid and worth calling out? Yes. \n\nWas it worth cancelling his entire birthday? No. \n\nHe\u2019s a teen. His friends were hounding him with questions about his sexuality. That\u2019s likely not very comfortable and he was handling it well. They were asking to learn from him - but it\u2019s NOT his responsibility to be teaching them. \n\nYou should have text him before \u201chey \u2014 are you comfortable with this? If you\u2019re not I can actively interrupt\u201d.  Or if he isn\u2019t a texting sort you should have found a way to disrupt the conversation - if your son was actually comfortable with this and wanted to continue the convo he would have picked it up again later. \n\nChances are he may have been feeling uncomfortable. Often when we\u2019re uncomfortable and feeling trapped we end up saying stupid things - his comment, although sexist, was also a way to go \u201chey guys - I\u2019m still like you. I\u2019m still part of the group.\u201d \n\nYou failed to read the situation Op. you should have intervened before it got to that point.", "I see youre doubling down on the \"women arent worth the trouble\" thing huh lmao. YTA. It was a joke, you should have treated it as such. And before anyone says anything about it being a sexist joke, hes a teenager. Let him make bad jokes.", "Good job proving his point. YTA!", "YTA.  And you just proved his point.   What a jerk you are!", "as much as I think he sounds like a brat, I\u2019m willing to accept that he\u2019s a teen and is still learning, but you, YTA for all of this", "YTA. He has a right to his own opinion. What he said wasn't sexist, teenaged girls can be a wreck, I know, I was one once.

You're acting more like a teenager than he is.", "YTA for sure.", "It's perfectly reasonable to believe same-sex relationships are easier when heterosexual relationships come with loads of social expectations over roles and behaviour. Besides, it was a jokey comment about *his own life*! \n\nYTA", "YTA. What an utterly unhinged overreaction.", "YTA: Under grilling from his hetero friends I\u2019m sure this was a pointed joke suggesting his life was easier not harder than theirs. A conversation about it being sexist and jerky would have been good. Cancelling an extravagant trip already planned and invites sent - wow that\u2019s an overreaction. Were you looking for an excuse to get out of paying for it?", "YTA. Whether you want him to or not, he isn't dating you.", "YTA and your reaction to what could have been a teachable moment between mother and son ended up being nothing more than the rantings of an immature woman with no personal sense of self respect.\n\nReally,??

Like other posters have said, this has obviously triggered something within you which needs to be resolved in your own time.\n\nAt 16 / 17 years old, young adults are discovering things about themselves, they're moving from childhood into adulthood and they need to have an open space to communicate feelings. In your son making this comment and you having this outburst, do you really think he'll feel comfortable coming to you in the future if he believes this is how you'll react?\n\nWe're all human, we make mistakes and can say things out of anger that can have a negative impact. If this happened with my child, I would be sitting him down and giving him a genuine apology for not only embarrassing him in front of his peers, but I would make sure that he knew that I would always be there for him if he needed to talk and that my reaction to his comment wasn't warranted.\n\nIt sounds like you already have an open communication relationship as you've mentioned he's open about being bisexual. Don't let this one instance ruin that relationship. Apologize, re plan his birthday party. The way this was handled, unfortunately YTA.", "> I asked him to explain what he meant. I told him if women aren't worth the trouble, then neither am I\n\nI wonder if she actually gave him time to explain what he meant?", "YTA, You don't ever embarrass your child especially in front of their friends. You could\u2019ve explain to him that it\u2019s not okay to (gender) stereotype others in PRIVATE, but instead you cancelled his birthday and called him a \u201csexist jerk\u201d seriously OP? That is also not okay to label others even if it\u2019s true about them. He was talking about his dating preferences not you. He is 16, you\u2019re the adult who\u2019s supposed to be fully aware of consequences and as his mom you\u2019re supposed to be the one who guides him, not the other way around", "YTA and I hope you\u2019re ready for your son to never make himself vulnerable around you again. He shared something he felt with his friends, admittedly in the form of a joke, and you went nuclear on him. \n\nWhy would he share his feelings with you now going forward? So you can punish him again?", "YTA.  Woman. Married a woman. Divorced a woman.

You\u2019re supposed to challenge problematic beliefs and talk it through, not humiliate and punish him! How can he confide in you if you blow up his life every time he says something stupid? How do you know some girl hasn\u2019t really hurt him? That would have been a fantastic opportunity to have a proper discussion (once his friends had gone!) which made him see girls and women are human and as different from one another as men and boys, instead you\u2019ve just really damaged your relationship with your child.", "What does his preference in sexual intimacy or dates has to do with you? You're not a potential lover ffs.\nYtA and your reaction is very disturbing.", "Lol. You basically proved him right.\n\nYTA", "YTA.", "Wow, YTA. What an insane overreaction to a harmless joke.", "Yeah, YTA.", "[removed]", "He is talking about his own romantic entanglements with women, the fact that you are comparing yourself to teenage girls dating your son is weird. \nLike you took it personally. \nHe didn\u2019t say anything horribly disparaging about women. Furthermore if a girl says \u201cmen aren\u2019t worth the hassle\u201d would you have the same response? \nYTA. A huge one.", "YTA\n\nyou realize he meant it as romantically yes?why are you so offended?", "YTA\nHe was shooting his mouth off with his friends, and likely didn\u2019t think too hard about what he said. You weren\u2019t part of the conversation and inserted yourself then we\u2019re incredibly rude. Is it something that needed to be addressed? Yes but in a private way and a heck of a lot more gently than what you did.", "I understand your impulse, but I think you could've handled it better - like actually waiting for his response / probing his thoughts further before the public shaming and punishment. He might've learned a lesson about sexism by your reaction, but it could be lost in the embarrassment / shame / anger.\n\nI would try a follow up convo, where you apologize for embarrassing him (and maybe overreacting, if you feel it was an overreaction in retrospect) and try to talk about the heart of the matter again. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nYou kind of proved his point though too.  You overreacted and caused drama.  He was having a frank discussion that didn't involve you, but then inserted yourself into.  Then became offended that he, as a bisexual guy, finds men to be easier to be in a relationship with.  Thus, proving his point.  \n\nHe wasn't being sexist.  He was stating his preferences.", "YTA.\n\nGet down from your high horse and try to listen.\n\nI\u2019m a bisexual woman in a relationship with a man and even if a love him I still feel sometimes that dating women was a little easier, using your son words \u201che is worth the trouble but it is still a lot of trouble\u201d. \n\nIt is normal, we know our body, we know our way fo thinking and expressing emotions and we have similar experience connected to our genders in the society. That is what you son did mean, something you could have understand if you had just avoid to go totally drama queen.\n\nAlso they are teens, in that period you barely understand yourself let alone understanding the opposite gender. I date a boy over 4 girls in my teens. \n\nAlso they were speaking about love/sexual relationships why would he be referring or thinking to you?\n\nApologize to him and give him is birthday back, you went totally overboard over nothing.", "You one hundred percent solidified his belief that women aren't worth the trouble. Congratulations.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nHe has the right to an opinion.

Not you. \nThere are different kinds of love and different ways to categorieze", "YTA.\n\nTotally confirmed his opinion that girls are a complete PITA.\n\nHope you weren't hoping for grandkids.", "Enjoy the year of awkward moments, angry looks, and distancing, cause you'll prolly not see him again when he turns 18. \n\nI cut off contact with my parents over them attacking me after coming out, and if you will attack him over something so minor, I can only imagine how else you attack him.", "Yta and you overrated massively. He was staying his personal preference and you turned it into a pity party for yourself as a woman, how ridiculous. You humiliated him and ruined his party, congrats.", "Wow. Are you on some power trip? \n\nAre 16-year-old boy sitting around with his male friends and makes a negative comment about women.... \n\nThat's normal. It wasn't even that disparaging. It sounds like somebody who just had a bad breakup with a girl. After a bad breakup with a guy, I often tell my friends I'm swearing off guys. I don't consider that sexist. \n\nAnd you decided to take the nuclear option of canceling his birthday weekend? The punishment doesn't fit the crime here. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Sure double down on him thinking women are difficult. \n\nHint, teen girls are very hard for teen boys to understand. Now he knows his Mom is the same.", "So basically you showed him he's right.

You could have used this as an opportunity for a calm discussion about why he thinks this way.", "[removed]", "Yes omg yes  YTA what an overreaction. Have some empathy and put yourself in his shoes. What 17 year old girl isn't a huge hassle (boy too?) \n\nInstead of straight up canceling his party you could have asked him what he meant by that (in private) and discussed why his thought process might have been hurtful to girls his age. But instead you just confirmed his thoughts by creating drama.", "YTA \n\nWhat a massive over reaction \n\nSounds like you do have a problem with it after all >.>", "assuming you have never dated another woman yourself, how would you know if dating a woman is difficult or easy?

Samsies.", "YTA and probably gave him another reason to believe women aren\u2019t worth the trouble. He meant romantically, not in general and you miss understood, like we usually do, and went ballistic. You are the AH mostly for canceling the birthday rather than for what you said.", "YTA. It's not a sexist thing to say women/girls are more difficult to date than men/boys. That's just simple fact. It's an entirely less complex affair when reproduction isn't on the table. He didn't say women or bad or worse or deserve less or any sexist thing, just that dating them is too difficult for him. Maybe hat's because his mother has given him the impression that women will freak the fuck out if he expresses the wrong opinion.", "YTA. You're coming down too hard on a 16 year old kid that said something stupid to show off with his friends. If I got punished every time I said something that made me sound like a jerk at that age I wouldn't have had anything. Teenagers have no impulse control. That's why we parent them. This was a teachable moment for you and you could have handled it with a discussion that he and his friends could have learned something from. Instead, you embarrassed him and took something fun away from his friends.", "YTA. Hell I'm a 39 F bisexual. Can confirm most dating, regardless of gender, is NOT worth it at that age. Have you met teenagers? Lol.", "Yta big time. If his comment bothered you, you could have chosen another moment to bring it up, not in front of his friends. This should have been a conversation, canceling his birthday was just a jerk power move and unwarranted.", "Ew you\u2019re not a good mother", "YTA. Aren\u2019t you just a real bright one /s", "I have a bisexual son... The girls he dated did him dirty. Hes now with his wonderful male fiancee, happier than i could ever have imagined.\n\nHes made comments before about girls being absolutely harder to date than men.\n\nI agreed, considering what i watched him go through with both sexes before he found Q.\n\nYou made the flippant comment about you and berated him then took away his birthday celebration because YOU got offended..\n\n\nHe isnt SEXIST, he made an observation based on his experience and answered a question.\n\n\nAre you REALLY  okay with his sexuality or did that ruin all hopes you had of him dating only girls in the future?", "Yta and immature. You could have explained to him nicely, and make him understand the problem with his statement, but nooo you just proved him right.\n\nYta a big time.", "Wow YTA. Just because he has a preference that he only expressed when HE WAS ASKED.  You\u2019re further proving his point by being that petty", "Yta. I cant see what you were hoping to achieve here. You've turned what could have been a good chance to teach your son into just proving his point that women are hard work. Congrats", "YTA he is talking to his friends why are you listening in and taking offense? Kids say something now and change their minds in the future. Girls his age in his mind are not worth the trouble and based on your reaction to his comment I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he things all women aren\u2019t worth the trouble. You could\u2019ve waited till his friends left and then asked but you made it a issue in front of his friends which makes you the AH", "Major YTA, this wasn't about you, tone it down. He talked about DATING women and you took it personally, that's a little creepy too. Aren't you curious to find out details about how he feels, what happened that made him feel that way? Do you just want to shut him up because you don't like this opinion he has?", "YTA, you validated his belief by taking something entirely too personal and blowing up. I sincerely doubt he was referring to you specifically, he was likely just trying to say his past experiences with DATING his PEERS (nothing to do with you) he doesn't prefer women. You could have pointed out to him how his phrasing might come off a bit harsh, but to nuke his whole birthday? Sounds like you're on the government funded retirement home path.", "YTA", "YTA, geesh, OP, did you flounce out of the room like a teenager too? Way to solidify the stereotype that women are moody and take things too far. Also, you embarrassed yourself even more than you embarrassed him. His friends are talking about OP\u2019s son\u2019s crazy mom for sure.", "YTA and it seems abundantly clear you're not okay with his choices. Being a good parent requires being open minded and understanding that you won't always share the same views.", "yta, that was a teaching moment, not a moment to make it about your feelings.", "YTA\n\nand proved him right.  fucks sake how can you suck at parenting this much after 17 years practice", "YTA. I'm women and therefore feminist but you are wrong here. You are his parent and you should parent him, not insult him. If you think he was offensive, talk to him in private. Also, he is allowed to have an opinion, maybe he was hurt by some woman or maybe he really find them to be more demanding. This is something you solve with conversation not by throwing fit like a toddler.", "So he's having a conversation with his friends and your response is to punish him for his experience and opinion? Interesting.\n\nWhy didn't you sit with him and have a conversation about his feelings? Again, Interesting.", "Sigh. As someone who\u2019s dated both men and women, a lot of bi people have preferences. And a lot of them might find it easier to connect to one gender over another. I think the appropriate way to handle this would\u2019ve been to have a light conversation with your son. I have a hard time believing he\u2019s seeing this as anything other than validation for his views, or punishment for his preference for men. YTA.", "Why is his parent equivocating themselves to a romantic interest? It's gross.", "While the son's phrasing is crass, a preference for dating their own gender is definitely something I have heard from people who have dated on both sides of the divide. It can just be easier to date someone who shares the same gendered life experience as you.", "YTA did you forget what high school girls are like?? Drama, gossip, backstabbing, more drama, out of whack hormones\u2026.as a female who was once in high school I agree with your 17 year old son\u2026.girls are not worth it. (At his age!!)", "Double it and give it to the next person.", "100% this kid already feels like he has to walk on eggshells around her.

What an odd thing to do. \n\nYou\u2019re also punishing him for having opinions.

Imho, pretty much offensive and uncalled for. And yes, a similar comment about men I would also find absolutely NOT okay.

I can understand that you\u2019d have a big knee jerk response to hearing your son talk about women derogatorily even if it\u2019s \u201cjust a joke\u201d. It\u2019d be different if he said that his past relationships with women weren\u2019t worth the trouble, but he didn\u2019t say that. He generalized about a group of people and punched down. So you reached for something that you thought would have the biggest impact to him, to try and convey the severity of how you feel (instead of calmly talking to him, maybe away from his friends).\n\nYou should sit down and talk with him about how it\u2019s important that even when he\u2019s joking around, that he\u2019s careful not only about the intent of what he\u2019s saying, but the potential impact. My sociology 101 professor actually did his dissertation on comedy, and a kid asked when is it okay to joke about hot topics (race, gender, etc). He said that as a general rule of thumb, you shouldn\u2019t make a joke at a marginalized groups expense if you belong to a group that has more societal privileges/has oppressed that group in the past (he said it more eloquently but I hope you get the point). For example, many people would just feel uncomfortable hearing a white person making jokes at a black person\u2019s expense or a man making a derogatory joke about women. His LGBTQ identity does not give him a pass to shit on women (gay or bisexual men can still be misogynistic). I think that if you talk about this with him, and he responds positively overall to your message, then you should let him have his birthday party.\n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t have this conversation with him calmly and apologize for your knee jerk reactions, then he will still use this language or get worse.

Because what he said was a *yellow* flag. Yes it's very common to make joking, sweeping statements about previous dates gone wrong, and it's not sexist to believe \"I personally find dating women more complicated than dating men, so I'd rather stick to the latter\". Even if you're the type of bisexual who's equally attracted to men and women, it takes more than sexual attraction to build a satisfying relationship.\n\nHowever, unfortunately there are a lot of men who use their negative romantic experience with women as justification for their sexist behavior, and that is not okay and needs to be addressed. Not only is it wrong if your son is making sweeping generalizations about all women based on his limited dating experience, I feel like there's this common mentality among sexist men that breaks down into \"I need to be nice to women so they'll date me. If I don't want to date them, there's no point to being nice.\" \n\nAnd that's why personally, I think your punishment was inappropriate.

It is a microaggression\n\nIt's not. Nobody is entitled to another person's romantic attention which is all he said. At at least this phase in his life, he feels women are not worth the effort for his romantic attention. He didn't say anything about not being about to sit next to a woman in class or in a group project. \n\nMen have no right to demand the romantic attention of women and that goes the opposite way too.\n\nIf the son was Ace and he said he found everyone too high maintenanced, would that be a sign that he secretly hates everyone?

And it\u2019s about realizing that saying that about women is going to hit differently than if, as in your example, he has said it about men or the general population. It hits different about women because that way of talking comes pre-entangled with a lot of context that he may well not know. Which is why a conversation (if OP is capable of it) would be warranted.\n\nIt would be different if he had said, \u201cWell, I last dated girls and right now I\u2019d rather date guys,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m tired of being excluded from LGBT spaces because the biphobia in the LGBT community is very real,\u201d or even \u201cWomen aren\u2019t worth the trouble because it\u2019s harder to meet them in my day-to-day life\u201d or some other explanation for why he said it that way. But just saying they \u201caren\u2019t worth the trouble\u201d is a loaded statement.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not about how anyone is entitled to his romantic attention. It\u2019s about having a million ways to say exactly that in a way that would not have been a problem to anyone (who wasn\u2019t already biphobic/homophobic), and he instead said something that IS a problem. \n\nI\u2019m telling you, as a queer woman, hearing that DOES hurt. It\u2019s a reminder of being a teenager and not wanting to be like other girls, those \u201cother girls\u201d who like \u201cgirly\u201d (meaning: unimportant) things, who are too much \u201cdrama\u201d (even though guys like watching trainwrecks too and are just as likely to be at the center of conflict).

He deserves to be approached like the almost-adult he is to discuss why that matters.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen the biphobia in the comments here, but I haven\u2019t looked at many of them and, sadly, given the prevalence of biphobia and homophobia, I believe you.", "Because that my abusive parent identifies as.

You had the typical \"mean girl\" trope that exploded in the early 2000s pinning the tomboys vs the femmes thanks to \"mean girls\". \n\nBut you also had media attacking the insecurities of femme women too such as America's Next Top Model and the Britney Spears scandal.\n\nSo a lot of the suffering that are generation had to undergo in terms of our identities as women was all just for Hollywood profits because that's what was the cool thing to do back then, I guess. It was entertaining to see separate subcultures of women going at each other's throats. \n\nBut another thing you need to consider to. Despite the world being slightly better in the last 8 years or so, it's still not safe to be in a same sex relationship everywhere in the world. Not even in more accepting countries. So the fact that he is willing to throw away the safety net of being in a non same sex relationship tells me that more likely he just doesn't have the attraction to women that he does to men and he just didn't have the right words for it at the time.", "Exactly.

Objectively, 16-year-old girls could be harder to understand for a 16-year-old boy than another boy. I DO agree the \"worth the trouble\" part is quite mean and silly but I also think maybe he had in mind many times he felt frustrated with girls because he is not understanding them yet. I am sure encouraging him to have more girl friends (not in his face but subtly) would in the long run more beneficial to his understanding of why some behaviors he deemed \"too much\" made sense on the other side. (Or on another note all teenagers can be overly emotional and irrational and he probably dated someone immature ...) \nHe was sexist but I genuinely think punishing him wouldn't help because at 16 one is, for a lack of a better word, emotionally self-centred and not very sensitive to others' perspectives.

I'll grant that drama is an inference. It's possible that what he meant are that women aren't worth the trouble, because he attends a boy's school and so has boys on tap, whereas getting to know girls is logistically difficult.

Women also seem to just generally have more going on in their lives/bigger friend groups, so that may mean that they're a little busier/harder to make plans with.

Why in the world did you take that so personally and react so disproportionately? Like yeah it was a shitry comment, and you should parent that. But you didn't parent, you flew off the handle and proved all of his negative thoughts correct.", "If you can\u2019t handle hearing about your son\u2019s sexual preferences that you \u201cdon\u2019t have an issue with\u201d and immediately take as some sort of personal attack on yourself, you should leave the room whenever he starts talking about it. YTA.", "YTA. What are you, twelve? His would have been opportunity to talk with your son and his friends about women and misogynistic expectations, gender roles, specific as to why he said that etc but instead you got all  personality hurt by his comment. If you\u2019re that thin skinned I can imagine you often find offense where none was intended. \n\nSecondly by canceling his trip you show him he has to have your approval for you to do nice things for him and ironically you showed him why women \u2018aren\u2019t worth the trouble\u2019.", "YTA-Just WOW. Your bisexual son was talking with his friends about his sexual preferences and you took personal offense to this? Seriously, WTF is wrong with you?", "YTA. First and foremost: You are his MOTHER, you are NOT his love interest \ud83e\udd22 \n\nMy parents spent the entirety of planning my 18th birthday and the actual party fighting with each other  over money and my dad made some very horrible comments that I still remember to this day. It may not seem like a big deal to many, but it\u2019s been 13 years and I still cry about it like it happened yesterday. \n\nIt is not the same situation BUT the point I want to make is that your son will most likely never forget this. That was a terrible, harsh, and heartless move on your part. \n\nI feel for your son and I really hope this doesn\u2019t affect him in his life the way I was affected. \n\nI wish him the happiest of birthdays.", "YTA - he\u2019s talking about dating women vs men, women aren\u2019t worth the trouble. Not women as a whole, not women in other roles. Dating. But maybe he\u2019s starting to thing women aren\u2019t worth it in other roles now as well.", "YTA\n\nKids are fucking savage and part of being an adult and a parent is not taking the bait.  Especially as they get older!  You overreacted and owe him an apology.  Especially because it\u2019s entirely possible that the one or two high school girls he\u2019s dated actually weren\u2019t worth the trouble!  So not only did you embarrass him, you might\u2019ve invalidated his (admittedly limited) life experiences too.", "I'm sorry but do the Op(s) write the title?  Um basically the title describes the action of an asshole, something like chastising my son for comments that I took objection to, but you use the word \" embarrassing \" say you did that with the intent of embarrassment on his part. I personally believe that you embarrassed yourself. Both with your extremely ridiculous reaction to an overhead comment made among friends as teenagers and frankly relating your hysterical reaction to the general public via this post. I truly feel like you have deep issues with your son's sexuality and you're holding out hope that this is simply a phase and he's going to come around and give you those grandkids.... Yikes. get help YTA", "YTA and only confirmed his belief that women aren\u2019t worth the trouble. This could have been a teachable moment and instead you cancelling his birthday? Yeah it was a boneheaded comment. But not worth all that.", "Umm, who is the adult here?", "YTA and a... Ugh, this just made me mad. You swung from spoiling him rotten to being psycho punisher.", "He isn't a sexist jerk, this is what happens when you have a shitty mother. I'm sure he knows that.", "I really hope you\u2019re trolling and not serious, because that\u2019s seriously ridiculous. A teenager making an off hand comment about his past relationships in what sounds like was a joking manner is not a serious statement about all women, and it clearly wasn\u2019t meant as an insult to you, his mother. Teenage girls are actually a lot of trouble a lot of the time. Get over yourself, teenagers sometimes say silly things, and now he will just resent you, possibly forever, and you definitely did nothing to improve his opinion on women.", "As his mother- why would you insert yourself in his generalization? Are you wanting to date him ? \nIt seems weird. He can feel how he feels about women, so long as he still respects them/us as humans. \n\nI\u2019m not going to call you an asshole, but you overreacted on a conversation you weren\u2019t even meant to hear of- nor take part in.", " Is the kid not allowed to have an opinion?  He was having a conversation with his friends that you didn\u2019t need to be involved in at all. Holy cow overreact much?  YTA", "YTA he was talking about dating preferences not his mother whom I assume he doesn\u2019t date. You got your panties in a wad by listening to a conversation you were not part off and the punished him for it", "INFO: why are you comparing yourself to your sons potential romantic/sexual partners? That is truly weird and creepy.", "Tbh it\u2019s probably not even a stereotype. Male/female and male/male sexual dynamics are very very different. Being bisexual he has probably noticed it and for now prefers the male/male dynamic esp. being young and inexperienced. \n\nI\u2019m gay and I always notice how straight men literally change personality around women whether they are sexually interested in them or not\n\nOr with a mom like that he has mostly experienced red flag women \ud83d\ude02", "I mean yeah, no better way to show him he is wrong than by proving his beliefs. YTA OP.", "YTA.  LOL, OP is working overtime to convince her son that his flippant joke is actually correct.", "Yep..one of them should have acted like an adult. Neither did.", "Didn\u2019t you just show him women aren\u2019t worth the trouble by your oversized reaction?", "This..she is definitely the asshole....a complete overreaction...shame on her", "Agreed! His comment wasn\u2019t nice, but damn, maybe OP should delve a bit deeper rather than taking it personally. Maybe he has been treated poorly in some relationships he shared with women and it\u2019s being generalized. OP had an opportunity to have a real conversation about healthy relationships and sexism with her son and instead chose to punish him without understanding why he feels that way.\n\nHonestly, OP did more in terms of reinforcing his opinion than she did for helping him learn something along with learning about his past experiences.", "I am also a bisexual feminist who graduated almost 15 years ago and can confirm dating girls in highschool isn't worth the trouble. Dating boys in highschool isn't worth the trouble. Just have fun, do your school work, and ask your parents for a pet instead... Maybe a goldfish.", "YTA. Agree withis it was way harsh.  You could have handled that so much better. Really, why take such a comment so personally? He is a young teen who is bound to say stupid stuff.  In his limited experience, he may honestly feel that way, and it could change as he gets into more mature relationships. \n\nYou could have pulled him aside or waited till his friends left and had an adult conversation with the soon to be adult.  Explained there is a tactful way to say things that hurt your feelings and why.  Made it a learning experience. \n\nInstead, you behaved like an AH teen. Wonder why he talks like this?", "Is it even that crass thoufg? He didn\u2019t even really insult them in a general wide brush of a specific insult or curse or call them names or anything. He literally just told his personal experiences. Women say \u2018men aren\u2019t worth it\u2019 when dating isn\u2019t going so well for them all the time, what\u2019s the difference\u2026", "Found OP's alt account.", "Or even just tap him gently on the head and tease, \"Careful who you say that around, kiddo.\"", "Ain\u2019t that the truth", "If I told my kids that I'd be a hypocrite. My wife and I met in 9th/10th grade and have been together since.", "Same thought crossed my mind as soon as I heard her response to his joke", "Dead.", "Awww.  My brother started dating his gf when they were 16 and they got married 2 years later. 31 years and 10 kids (and 3 grandkids) later, they still act like love sick teenagers. Sometimes you just get lucky like that.", "One of my favorite teachers married her HS sweetie. They were also well traveled and educated folks, so it shouldn't be a shame to have someone you've had a good life with. Y'all just got an early start :]", "Yeah, by the time kids are teens, you only get a small amount of maturity from the passage of time. Most of it comes from lived experiences. \n\nSometimes you need to make (a varying amount of) your beginner mistakes before you can get good at something.", "Glad I\u2019m not alone in thinking that was really weird.", "Watching other kids make those mistakes is also a pretty viable strategy. Worked well for me.", "Jocasta Complex.", "Yeah, but somebody's still gotta make them \\^\\^:", "Yeah, this one. I just couldn't remember and Google refused to give the right answer. Thanks.", "Nta misogyny shouldn't be excused. If he apologised I'd still let him have a party, but Def sit down and have a talk w him", "Agreed. \n\nHes currently dating a guy so when asked, he may have just felt he had to assert that he does not prefer women. Hes a kid and may have thought that if he said anything to imply otherwise, it may have made his bf insecure. Thats what id assume.\n\nOr maybe he just has had bad experiences with the girls he dated.\n\nRegardless, OP wouldnt know because she flipped on her teen son", "I would also like to say that she's TA for taking her son's personal/sexual preferences personally. She took it as a personal insult. How does it have anything to do with her? Why does she feel the need to punish him for his opinion unless she feels like it's a personal insult to her? I feel like she's one of those moms who are way too involved in their son's personal life.", "I can't believe I had to scroll this far down to find this comment. Did she give him any time to answer? If so, what did he say? If she immediately canceled the party without giving him time to answer that's clear YTA to me, but if he said something like \"Well all women are liars who use their emotions to manipulate men into giving them money\" it'd be NTA. Given that she doesn't include the response I have to assume she didn't give him time to answer but I am curious", "This is perfect.", "Also he's made a remark about dating, how tf is it related to his parents (OP in particular)?", "YES THIS IS SO TRUE.", "Stop with the teen girl movie cliche's most teen girls i've known are not like that", "> I cannot stand it when people say that's just a dumb teenage thing and you shouldn't step in but then when those dumb teenagers grow into adults who were never punished for doing dumb things and now think they're ok the same people act like they're just trash.\n\nLet's give the son's statement the least charitable reading possible, and assume that he actively hates all women and was making a serious expression of that to his friends, in the incidental presence of his mother. What \"punishment\" is appropriate for a teenager holding a belief their parent deems wrong? And what is threshold of wrongness required to invoke punishment? If, for example, OP was Catholic and her son decided he wanted to become a Baptist, would that similarly be worthy of punishment?", "I have 2 teenage nieces and I cringe so hard inside at some of the stuff they say and holy shit is the drama next level. I would rather lay down in the middle of traffic than listen to the two of them argue.", "A baseball bat?  She basically used a tactical nuclear strike on him given that she humiliated him in front of his friends and likely drove him over the line from Bisexual into Gay territory, cementing his thoughts about the female gender by her out-of-proportion reaction.", "Yeah. A lighthearted, \u201cWhat about me? Am I worth the trouble?\u201d would help him get the picture. So, so many ways OP could have handled this.", "As a single parent...gross.", "I second this! I\u2019ve been dating my now husband since my sophomore year and we\u2019ve been together for 15 years. Expecting our own little one soonush", "My parents likewise - 51 years so far."]}
