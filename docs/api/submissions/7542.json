Right now he genuinely feels like women aren't worth the trouble and you want to punish him for saying that? Like literally take away his birthday? He was asked sexual preference for dating and he answered, he didn't give some general \"women are AH's\" or something like that and you're ridiculous for taking that so personally when you know exactly what he meant. Apologize and give the kid back his freaking birthday before he feels like he has to walk on eggshells around women for the rest of his life. Ironically this overreacting shit is probably exactly where he was coming from with his answer so you kind of proved his point. (I AM a woman so don't even come at me trying to claim I'm some sexist guy, I'm not)", "YTA. Instead of talking to him about stereotypes and how dangerous they can be, you took your personal trigger and punished your kid for it. \n\nIf you think he\u2019s being a sexist jerk, address how that came to be and explore it. You\u2019re his mom and you\u2019re the one that supposed to guide him. \n\nBe better. He\u2019s a teen and you\u2019re a full grown adult who\u2019s supposed to be able to fully appreciate consequences.", "YTA, he is 16, kids say dumb things. This could have been a teaching moment but instead he will double down on this belief.", "YTA\n\nYou knew what he meant you just wanted to take the opportunity to embarrass him in front of his friends. \n\nWould it be considered \"sexist\" to you if you heard a female relative saying \"men aren't worth the trouble\"?", "YTA. \n\nExcellent job being the mature one. /s", "YTA.  Your son probably thinks women are not worth the trouble after watching you overreact all his life, just like now.  Correcting him is fine and necessary, but canceling his birthday party?  No wonder he said that.", "YTA & I'm bisexual & female been that way since I was 15. I 100% agree with your son, at this age I found them a hassle or guys. I'd complain to my mom she'd always laugh or tell me i get the best of both worlds.", "YTA and you\u2019re proving him right.", "YTA and as a woman, at that age I also felt the same. I am bisexual and knew this at a fairly young age. I had my entire earth shattered by a girl I would've done anything for when I was a teen. He's a normal bisexual teen going through normal bisexual teen things. Plus you proved him right.", "What a horrible mother.", "YTA - Omg what is wrong with you?  Saying \"Women aren't worth the trouble\" is referring to girls his age and a completely normal thing for boys to say.  You need a bigger self esteem and stop interjecting yourself into teenager drama.", "YTA. This is a conversation you have with your son in private to establish appropriate views of gender equality and what is sexism. That's an off-hand statement that would fit in any 2000's sitcom with a laugh track. Also there are very real differences when bisexual men date men vs women, which is a conversation worth having.", "YTA - are you sure you\u2019re 100% on board with his sexuality? Because he expressed an opinion about his sexuality and you punished him by taking away his birthday gifts. That doesn\u2019t sound like 100% on board. That also sounds like someone who came out as bisexual because it was more palatable to you than coming out as gay\u2026. Probably wrong in that, and it\u2019s a wild assumption I admit, but as a 40 year old gay man who came out in the mid-90\u2019s to my mother as bisexual (because she\u2019s always wanted grandchildren) I could be projecting. For for the record my mom is a rockstar and I couldn\u2019t be better blessed with an amazing ally. Also at 15 and just coming out, I was afraid. \n\nEither way though, HE expressed an opinion on HIS sexuality, and you punished him. That\u2019s not being an ally. That\u2019s not being \u201cok\u201d with it. Fix it and do better. You undermined his faith in you and that\u2019s something you\u2019ll either have to live with, or work to improve.\n\nEdit: apparently I can\u2019t spell worth shit.", "YTA. He\u2019s a teen. He is going to do and say stupid things. All you\u2019re doing by punishing him is ensuring he won\u2019t be honest with you. \n\nApologize for your overreaction and reinstate his party.\n\nPS-I also am a mother of grown children.", "#YTA\n\nI don\u2019t think an explanation is necessary in this case.", "YTA\n\nThat's a sentiment we ALL had as teenagers, and now at times... guys and girls, bisexual or not. All of us. Teenage boys and girls are both going through hormonal nightmares, and dating is awful at that age (and later).\n\nAnd as a bisexual man, I can tell you, dating another guy is often 100000% less complicated as a guy, and probably especially so when it comes to teenage angst and drama.\n\nWay to reinforce his views.", "YTA.\n\nYour son is a teen. What he was saying is apparent to anyone with a brain. He was saying that the guys he has dated have been quite straightforward, whereas there has been much more drama and hassle involved in dating a girl.\n\nYou decided to shoehorn yourself into his conversation and make it about you, because that's what assholes do.", "YTA. Don\u2019t be surprised when he holds the cancelled party over you for the next 50 years. Or just goes no contact.", "Yta this is a teachable moment. Parenting isn't about punishment its about teaching and guiding. You did neither.  Also you need to work on controlling your emotions.", "YTA. Embarrassment and shame punishments are an awful way to patent and just leads to more resentment from the kids being punished. In top of that, you're punishing him for realizing he has a dating preference? Why should it matter who he prefers to date as long as he's happy? Honestly, teenage girls are a nightmare, and I don't blame your son for his opinion one bit. Eventually, when he's older, he might even change his mind if he doesn't stick with his current partner. This is just going to guarantee he'll want less to do with involving you in his life when he gets out.", "YTA. Teenagers say a LOT of stupid things, especially to their friends. There are better ways to educate him on sexism.", "YTA. Your 16yr old son isn\u2019t the spokesperson for the LGBTQA community. You guys overwhelmed him with a parade of questions, that he\u2019s still trying to figure out the answers to. He\u2019s 16. And he has a 16yrs olds vocabulary\u2026.. also, your sons response was likely him testing the waters to how you would feel if he just came out as gay, and not bi. And u failed. -restart the trip, and tell your son misogyny is not a flattering colour on him, and that it makes him look fat.", "YTA.  Your son was relaxed and sharing openly about his feelings and experiences, not making a global statement about something being wrong or inferior about women.  Then to say what you did in front of his friends was also really bad.  It would have been better to bite your tongue until you could speak privately to him to express your concerns and let him respond.  I feel badly for him, tbh.  Sounds like is was going to be a cool birthday weekend.", "YTA.  Not because your opinion is wrong.  It's a punishment should fit the crime.\n\nYou made a pretty big escalation for some words he said to his friends.  It doesn't leave too much room for when he does something really bad.  At this point, if he breaks curfew you will kick him out of the house.", "YTA.  Where could he possibly have gotten the idea that women aren\u2019t worth the trouble?", "YTA. I would have mentioned that that can be a rather rude generalization to make, and that clearly women aren't all bad as you're being kind enough to throw him such an amazing bday party. But I wouldn't have cancelled it, what he said wasn't that serious.", "YTA This had nothing to do with you. This was about HIS dating experiences and how he felt. Get the f over yourself.", "YTA. You can correct your kid. Or even ask him what happened that\u2019s made him come to this conclusion. But to cancel his bday party over it\u2026 well that just further proves his point.", "YTA...are you 5? He was talking about romantically! Are you one of his romantic interests? He was having a friendly chat with his buddies and you really are gonna sit there and get offended by this harmless comment? Sounds like you kinda do \"have an issue with this.\"", "I don't understand why people are so offended by his remark that women aren't worth the trouble to date.  I am a woman, I am not offended.  I am assuming he sees differences in men and women and women are more challenging because they are different from him so harder to understand and interact with.  Of course that makes sense.  Whatever.  I guess I don't understand why it is so offensive a comment.  Who cares why he prefers to date guys?", "YTA, period", "YTA I'm a woman and I think that's an overreaction. It was a joke, not actual proof that your son is a sexist. Unless he has treated women with disrespect or constantly showed that he has a low view on women, then I think you were too harsh and assumed the worst of your son.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't just embarrass him in front of his friends. You know you are supposed to be the adult, right? If you had a problem with something he said, why not have a conversation with him. What does he mean, what were his experiences that led to his comment? \n\nBut, you chose irrational overreaction with punishment that has nothing to do with the action.\n\n Good parenting /s", "YTA, did you also punish him when he went through the \"girls are gross/have cooties!\" phase? \n\nI'm a woman,  a feminist,  I march in the street for our rights etc and I don't find what he said to be that big of an issue.   Girls his age can be ridiculously dramatic and mean,  he's probably had some bad experiences and prefers dating boys.  \n\nYou could have taken him aside and explained how his words were hurtful, but you just went full nuclear. \n\nHe's young,  he's still learning and his brain is still developing.   Help guide him, but don't act like a dictator.  You'll just push him away.\n\nETA: are you seriously going to tell me that while hanging with your female friends you've never said *anything* negative about men?  Did you jump on any of your girlfriends that did?", "YTA, you have no problem with your sons sexuality as long as he likes women more", "whoa, YTA. he's talking about his sexuality and dating preferences\u2014not about women in general, and certainly not you, his mother. you embarrassed him in a double whammy. this is a surefire way for him to be hesitant to speak to you ever again, especially about personal things. you need to apologize properly for your outburst.", "YTA: his friends had questions and he answered honestly.  Instead of privately asking him why, you automatically became TA in this situation.  He\u2019s entitled to his feelings. He didn\u2019t say he hated women, he said he basically prefers not to date them. Oh and you proved his point.  Don\u2019t see him visiting often when he gets away from you.  We\u2019re you expecting everyone to jump on your bandwagon when you basically put down a kid who is exploring his sexuality? Btw, I\u2019m a 70 yr old woman who is way more conscious of sexism against women then you likely are.", "YTA unless you are dating your son,  he's obviously talking about girls his age! Talk about overly sensitive and taking things personally.\n\nHe's a 16 year old who has his very little life experiences. This was his OPINION based on said experience.\n\nGrow the hell up!!! I would be embarrassed to have an immature mother like you.", "You\u2019re definitely the asshole here. At a base level it wouldn\u2019t have killed you to talk to him about it without his friends around, who could very well be affecting the way he answered. Also just canceling the party and calling him a sexist jerk completely misses the point of parenting, teaching children right from wrong. If you feel that strongly his answer was wrong then have a conversation, don\u2019t just did your child.", "YTA. I'm a woman, and I think you massively overreacted. Dumb drama stuff like that on your part might be one of the reasons for your son's concerns regarding women.", "Yeah, YTA. You are the parent. This is a great parenting moment that you did not take advantage of. Instead, you got flooded, lashed out at your kid, and embarrassed him in front of his buddies who are all just learning about the world.", "YTA. What on earth? Both sexes often joke that the opposite sex isn\u2019t \u201cworth it.\u201d Who cares ? It\u2019s a joke, and even if it wasn\u2019t, still who cares?\n\nSigned,\nA feminist", "Yta. Lol. Women aren't worth the trouble - woman immediately shows she's the worst. Sigh.", "So you proved him right? What do you think that will teach him?", "YTA evening what he said was sexist which in my opinion it isn't. Women are obviously more difficult to hook up with than men. I can easily understand why someone who's attracted to men and women equally would pursue the easier option.", "YTA. He is a sixteen year old boy hanging out with his friends. He was talking about 16 yr old girls not his mom. You owe your son an apology and a party!", "16yo kid: *says stupid thing about women*\n\nMom of 16yo kid: *does something to support kid's opinion of women to teach him a lesson*\n\nThis wasn't the teaching moment you thought it was.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Why did you insert yourself there? It sounds like people were pushing him to give a preference so he just said something in the moment. It's also personal. Maybe dating women really isn't as worth it to him. If you wanted a real conversation with him, you should have waited until his friends were no longer there. If you wanted to call them all out for sexist thinking, you could have done that too.", "Yta. I\u2019m a mother of adult children. \nHe\u2019s a teenager, you are his mother.\nI\u2019m sure his brain wasn\u2019t even connecting that you might be offended.\nThe brain doesn\u2019t even mature for about 5-6 more yrs.\n\nBut you are an adult and presumably have better control over your words and behavior. \nOr not because you are kinda proving his point.\nThat some women are about the drama.", "Yta. He's 16. He made a stupid comment. Instead of exploring it privately, and explaining how it made you feel, why that statement is hurtful, and sexist..... , you blew up and cancelled the party. And now he is rolling his eyes at his friends saying ,see what I mean? women are too much.  He wasn't being mean to you, just expressing his experience as a bi man In the worls.", "YTA way to prove his point by being super petty and acting your shoe size not your age.", "YTA", "YTA. He\u2019s a teenager. Teens say dumb things. All you\u2019ve done is possibly reinforce his idea of \u201cwomen not being worth the trouble\u201d, because at this point, you are the main woman role model in his life. Teens are very impressionable at this point in their life, and your actions right now can easily damage your relationship with your son for a long long time. If you really have a problem with what he said, it would have been much easier to just talk to him privately without the company of his close friends. This could have been a learning experience for him if handled well, but all you did was make him resent you.\n\nYTA for sure. I genuinely wish you luck with your situation, but the first step to resolution is admitting your own wrongdoing.", "YTA, You took that so personally and ruined his only 17th birthday over a joke relevant to their conversation, which, might I add, you were not actually a part of. Undoubtedly him and his friends are talking about it now and the only thing you should be thinking about is how you can make it up to him. Don't try to argue with your son for the sake of arguing.", "YTA and basically supported your son\u2019s dating preference. You didn\u2019t just embarrass your son, but yourself as well.  This could have been an educational / learning conversation with his friends but you wanted to start an argument and you got one.", "Way to prove your kids point.  Yta", "Yikes. Yes, YTA. That was pretty terrible, and way to reinforce his opinion of women. You could have very easily talked to him the next day without ruining both his birthday and potentially your relationship.", "YTA. Instead of finding out more about what his statement meant, instead of taking the opportunity for a teaching moment, you chose to be butthurt and petty instead. Your son is right, (some) women aren\u2019t worth the trouble.", "YTA, so you're punishing him for expressing an immature opinion, when he's an immature teenager?", "YTA... And a big one. The kid was talking to  his friends and you butted in where you didn't belong and got your panties in a twist. Newsflash: It wasn't about you. But now it is.", "Well you kind of proved his point! YTA", "YTA. Your son is a child, they say stupid stuff. You going off the deep end over an offhand comment, proving his point in the first place. You were the only adult in the room, yet your little tantrum was the most juvenile of all.", "YTA- You just confirmed his statement by taking away his birthday trip because you did not agree with what he said.", "YTA. I hate generalization, but he wasn't doing that, he referred to HIS experience, he never said that was the case for everyone. You just proved him right. I'm a bisexual woman, and I can tell you, sometimes women really aren't worth the trouble, just like you jeez", "YTA - surely you didnt actually cancel his birthday over this right? Like, you just threatened to do it? What a ridiculous over reaction", "YTA it seems like he maybe hasn't had the most pleasant experiences dating women and to him it isn't worth it to date them. Again he was talking about dating  not saying they aren't worth being around or being friends or that they're beneath him or any other way it could be taken. If he doesn't think they are worth dating then to him they aren't. That was not a personal attack on you and it's strange that you immediately took it that way. Your actions are drastic and mean", "I'm bisexual and I think men aren't worth the effort. Your son isn't necessarily being sexist, it's just easier to relate to the same sex.", "YBTA You knew what he ment, but the comment before and after you'res wasn't needed.", "So you thought you would help him make his point about women not being worth the trouble? \nI can guarantee those kids left with a lesser view on women because of you not your son. You\u2019re supposed to be guiding your son and teaching him about people. You didn\u2019t ask why he thought this way you just decided to jump in and punish him. Huge parenting fail. Do better.", "So . Yes YTA . For overreacting. The kid definitely needs checked. But you should have done that privately.  If he displayed behaviors that persisted before this then maybe???? But still he's a kid. Probably trying to look cool\n Is it right? Absolutely not and never excuse it. But there are ways to correctly teach and that isn't this", "YTA and he is absolutely 100% correct you women aren't worth the trouble congratulations on proving it to the world and to your son", "ESH. He absolutely needed to be corrected, but you should have done it with a serious, private conversation in which you could show him why it's wrong to throw around sexist comments like that. Instead, you took personal offense and snapped back, which only convinced him to believe what he said himself -- when he probably didn't even believe it at the time he said it; he just thought he was being funny. \n\n\nThis wasn't the way to handle it. It's not even that taking away his birthday party was too harsh; it's that it didn't actually teach him anything.", "I'm torn on this one. I'm leaning toward YTA in that canceling once a year special events as a punishment is generally an AH move. He absolutely needs to be corrected for what he's saying (even if he doesn't \"mean\" it and is just saying it as a poorly thought out joke), but there are other ways to do it rather than blowing up birthday plans.\n\nThat being said, I also hate supporting this crap in any way. -\\_- But I figure if I'm going to believe that taking away once a year events is an AH move, I should stick by it even if it's for something like this.\n\nEdit: BTW that judgement isn't for embarrassing him in front of his friends - good on that one.", "YTA you just proved his point and it's not like he's wrong at least anecdotally from every bi person I've talked to man or woman they say women are a lot more difficult to deal with in a relationship than a man.", "I can't believe the hypocrisy in these comments if a woman really posted \"men aren't worth the trouble of dating\" she'd get bombarded with hate comments and possibly doxxed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If some guy heard me say that and reacted like this i would think he was a psycho.", "exactly she took it way way to personally.   her son is entitled to his opinion from his own experiences whether its wrong or not and she punished him for it severly.", "I am a heterosexual woman and i can totally see how this would happen.", "Honest question, do you find the same if you are dating bi/pan/other queer identifying women? \n\nI\u2019ve realised that a lot of my experiences with men for instance are different from people I know, because by chance/exposure, the vast majority of them have been somewhere in the rainbow.", "I know right?\nEesh\nI had some friends that were all about the drama. From my perspective it was fascinating.\nI was basically hanging out with people who taught me what you don\u2019t want to be in life, but my mother potentially killed my father when I was 17, so I did not have great role models at home either.( she did not call 911 when he had a stroke/seizure & he died)\n\nHowever my own kids are people that I would be thrilled to know even if I was not related.\nFabulous people, I wish I could have given them a broader background of support when they were growing up. \nWhen you know better you do better.", "Because painting one entire gender as \u201cnot worth it\u201d is dickish. \n\nI probably leaned a bit hard into how shitty it was but at the very least she should have talked with him about it not being great. But she did go overboard.", "I feel like it's also kind of weird that she is reading sexism into a statement from her teenage son regarding who he prefers to date, in highschool.", "I'm a 46 year old woman and I'm not currently dating because lately I've found men to be nothing but drama and not worth the trouble. So I'm not dating them right now. I bet you don't have the same reaction to a woman saying it?", "He didn't say \"women aren't worth it.\" He said HE doesn't want to date them because HE doesn't feel it's worth the trouble. There's a HUGE difference in that.", "If it was a friend I\u2019d probably just shrug (and I did say I went too hard in the original post) but stopping to actually consider it it\u2019s still overreaching, generalized and kinda shitty, sorry. And yeah I\u2019m probably a hypocrite since I\u2019ve probably said similar in exasperation, shitty or not. But I try to be mindful of what I say.\n\nBut even then, I think it\u2019s more important to give some feedback to a kid, even one near adulthood, to make them actually think about shit and have some balance to it.", "Thats not different at all.", "He said \u201cwomen aren\u2019t worth the trouble.\u201d It\u2019s right there. Maybe he meant it in a different way but it\u2019s not what he said.", "Opinions are often stated this way but are generally understood to be opinions. I can say, \u201cEggs aren\u2019t worth $5 a dozen\u201d. And generally people will understand that I mean that eggs aren\u2019t worth $5 a dozen *to me*. I\u2019m not making a general statement about the inherent worth of eggs. Someone else might love eggs very much and think they are worth $5. Other people might have a lot of money so they have no problem paying $5 a dozen. But it\u2019s a pretty common convention to imply that my statement is my subjective viewpoint without using an explicit qualifier. Someone would have to be very obtuse or painfully socially incompetent to not understand that.", "Well yeah but I guess I\u2019m struggling to figure out why pointing out that it his opinion is important here. Like\u2026 of course it is, that doesn\u2019t really make it better?", "You\u2019re the one who\u2019s claiming he\u2019s making a generalized statement about women when he\u2019s not. He\u2019s stating a valid personal opinion. He thinks that dating women isn\u2019t worth the trouble. He\u2019s allowed to think and say that. Maybe he will one day have the emotional maturity and tolerance to frustration that it can take to navigate a relationship with someone of the opposite gender. But he\u2019s just stating his valid subjective experience. It\u2019s nothing to get offended over."]}
