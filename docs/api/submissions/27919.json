And.. if it's the husband, who ends up needing to drive the pregnant wife, he could either go get his car and pick her up, or take her car from their closer space.", "Because the wife is pregnant so would not be able to walk as far, and same goes for post childbirth. Whereas other than a minor inconvenience hubby can park a little further away and walk", "The husband have to drive his car all the time ? If they are together they can take wife's car or husband go get the car and pullover in front ? If it is about preferencial they have to get used to it because there will be one car with all babyshit and moving lots of things is more of a hassle than driving different car.", "This! 110%. They will not move when you want them to because the moment you give them permission, in their heads that becomes THEIR parking spot forever.", "Why? They chose to breed. The world doesn\u2019t owe them convenience because they choose to have a child (and yes, I have kids and nobody owes me a damned thing for passing my DNA along).", "Nobody is entitled to use something that belongs to you even if you aren't using it  Doesn't make you a AH.\n\nThis isn't kindergarten and nobody has to share."]}
