They obviously haven't changed since they're calling you an asshole when you won't give them what they want. There are other options out there. Why doesn't your sibling stay with the friend who agrees with them that you're the asshole? Maybe after that friend lives with them for a little while, they'll be able to see your perspective a little more clearly.", "NTA\n\nIf they had really changed they wouldn't be demanding to live with you and badmouth you to their friends.\n\nAlso their friends heard a very one sided story from your sibling out to paint themselves in a better light.", "If you\u2019re \u2018an asshole\u2019 then they shouldn\u2019t want to live with you.

It doesn't sound like your sibling has taken full responsibility for their behavior in the past and it's totally fine to keep them out of your home.", "NTA -your house so you get to choose and you also need a safe space. Seems like those 5 years of therapy are not helping your sibling be less of a manipulative A when they don't get what they want.", "NTA. The people judging you haven\u2019t asked for your side of the story, so their judgment is not valid. To distill: your sibling wants to stay in your house, you don\u2019t want them to, they argue and trash you behind your back. The answer is NO. Don\u2019t cave in, you\u2019ll regret it.

Two yeses, one no).", "I don't think you're an AH because there's fair, prior experience that is making you wary. But, I'd ask yourself some key questions:\n\n1. Did they do that therapy after your first experience living with you? If so, is there a chance that they have actually, genuinely grown? 5 years is a lot of time. \n2. You have a partner, now, presumably that was not presently living with you the last time you lived with your sibling. Does the fact that you're not alone in this help you feel more prepared to potentially live with them again?\n3. Are the issues you had with them ones that you can reasonable place expectations around? I.e., can you create ground rules with them that they'd have to follow in order for them to live with you? Not having certain things around, no guests, etc. that they'd have to agree to in writing before living with you? \n4. Can you place a time restriction around it? If they really only need a few months, can you put in writing that it's your expectation that they move out after x months, presuming that meets their needs?\n\nIt's really up to you and you are under no obligation to let anyone live with you, but given that it's for a few months and they claim to have done a lot of self work, it could be good for your relationship to give them another chance. I tend to prescribe to a \"everyone deserves a second chance\" attitude that a lot of people don't prescribe to, so that's just my two cents. I think there's a way to do this that could be a positive experience for everyone, but if your gut is really saying no, then by all means, don't do it.", "NTA. \n\nFor starters their friends opinions matter as much as shit on the floor, so id ignore them completely, they are biased and have no say in this.\n\nI was originally going to say it might be a good time to repair the relationship, until i read \"i feel unsafe\" in which case the abuse was obviously a fair bit worse than just an average siblings anger. \n\nIf you feel unsafe, then you should not put yourself in that position", "NTA,\n\nIt\u2019s your living space and you get decide who lives there. And since you\u2019ve already had bad experience in the past it\u2019s understandable that you don\u2019t want to go through that again.  Don\u2019t worry about friends either, they\u2019re only hearing one side of story and are making premature accusations. Also your sibling sounds like a racist , another red flag to avoid.", "NTA - when your sibling told all their friends did they also tell everybody the correct reasons of why not I wonder.", "I don\u2019t think you are the asshole whether you allow them to or not. You are allowed to choose who stays in your home or not, for any reason.\n\nIf you DO decide to let them stay for the month, it would not hurt to make some firm boundaries and kick them out if they are not followed.", "INFO: how many years has it been since you lived with your sibling? Have they completed therapy between that point and now?", "NTA, but I would say, give your sibling another chance. If all those years of therapy happened after you stopped rooming together, there is a good possibility they really are different.\n\nThe thing I would say is, when you are a victim of abuse, and have suffered since then, you\u2019re likely to always be thinking of the worst case scenario. Which I think might be happening here. While there is a chance some problems may look familiar, it is *never* going to be exactly the same again. I know because I\u2019ve felt this way too. And you have the power to chance it now.\n\nObviously you don\u2019t have to go with my suggestions. But if you would consider it, i\u2019d say give your sibling a trail period and if they have minor problems you could tell them to stop or if it\u2019s major they can\u2019t stay. It\u2019s up to you if you want to deal with these potential problems of course, but it isn\u2019t going to be the same or as horrible as it used to be. I really hope you can believe that.\n\nYou\u2019re an adult, you have your partner now and years of perspective. Things will be okay.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was just wondering, if you changed your mind so you think that potentially y\u2019all could bond and talk about your trauma? It might make your relationship do a 180.
