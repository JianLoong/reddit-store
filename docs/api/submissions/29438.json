I didn't mind before. But now? No. I'm not doing it. I do not have the patience to love her through all her shitty behavior. It was always there but it gets worse the older she gets and I would not be a good fit. I could not just take it and I don't want to. I don't want to take care of her.

It is incredibly mature of you to realize that you are not suitable for this task, and honestly, you are the only one making a rational, adult decision in this topic. I am sure your parents are exhausted, physically, emotionally, and financially from this. That doesn't justify their failure to protect you and be your parent too.

Now, one of this sibling's offspring is also a guardian, if my sibling has health issues.  If one of us hadn't stepped up, other guardians were possible, and my parents would have worked that out.  They considered it their job.  \n\nI became guardian for someone else, a relative of my spouse, with a need for guardianship for their entire life.  Guardianship is a job.  It's not a job anyone should take on without wanting to do it.  I had this relative's abusive parent stalking me and threatening me for a while, because they weren't in control anymore.\n\nEspecially, **your parents should not be manipulating you into this job when you not even an adult yet.**  They should be focusing on what you need, what education you want, how to help you become independent and reach for your own goals.

Do you have a place you can go to stay, if your parents continue to allow your sister to abuse you like this?  Emotional and verbal abuse can take a long, long time to heal from, and the sooner you are out of your sister's reach, the healthier for you.  \n\nIf you can, get hold of your important documents.

If your parents hoped you would be willing to take care of your sister, they should have fostered a healthy sibling relationship.  That they just expected you to is awful. You\u2019re not a back-up parent, you are your own person and deserving of your own life free of their burdens. \n\nMy little brother has autism. He\u2019s 21 now. Like your sister, he\u2019s verbal and is capable of doing a lot of things but cannot live on his own. I was extremely involved in helping to raise him (I was 13 when he was born). I interned at his specialized pre-school/kindergarten, I learned how to drive a bus when I turned 18 so I could be the bus driver for him so he\u2019d go to a special summer day camp, I dressed as Santa every year so he wasn\u2019t afraid, I did a ton of stuff for and with him. When I went to college, I chose a local one so I could stay home and remain heavily involved. \n\nHe became very manipulative as he got older. When he ran away from home and showed up on my doorstep, I took him in. I lasted six weeks before I told him he had to choose a parent to live with (our mom and his dad are divorced but alive and can care for him). I told him I have children and a wife and I cannot just care for an adult disabled man who has a lot of manipulative/destructive behaviors and I can\u2019t expose my kids to it.\n\nMy mother was so angry. She told me it was \u201cmy turn\u201d with him. I reminded her that she became pregnant with him, she raised him and permitted many of his least healthy behaviors to persist, and she is his mother. We\u2019ve gone non-contact and my brother is so angry I wouldn\u2019t care for him that he doesn\u2019t talk to me either. \n\nThe truth is: caring for siblings who have autism is often completely thankless. I suspect that autism is really just brain damage caused by metal toxicity and the damage mimics the \u201cdivergence\u201d you find in people who are psychopathic. I hate to say it, but I\u2019ve never met a person with autism who has the capacity to empathize and love the way most neurotypical people can.

Absolutely not. \n\nI'm not going to comment on how they handle your sister's behavior because I have never been in their position, but the way they're expecting you to take on their responsibilities toward their daughter is utterly unacceptable, IMO.", "NTA. I have two siblings with different challenges than your sister who need a lot of care. I finally had it out with my parents and made it very clear that I'm not capable of love AND support, I can only do one. I chose love. I will have them for holidays and show up to support them in court and hug them when they're sad. I won't give up the peace in my own home, handle their finances, or make medical decisions. The way I put it my mom is that you can hire someone to handle stuff, you can't hire someone to legitimately care about them, so I'm going to do the thing that only I can do and let professionals manage the things they do best. \n\nYou didn't choose to have this child, you aren't responsible for her. If you are able to manage a few things when she is an adult, that's great, but you have every right to have boundaries and put yourself first. \n\nFor what it's worth, no one can *make* you care for your sister. So once you're an adult, you're free. It might be best to dial it down a bit while you're still at home just so you have less conflict in the day to day, but that's your choice to make.", "NTA, it sounds like your parents simply excuse everything she does.  I'm not saying she should be punished for things she really has no control over, but you don't just laugh everything off either.", "NTA. Chances are you won\u2019t get to have a family of your own if you take care of her. Can you imagine having your sister in your home, and your future partner and kids having to deal with this? \n\nYour parents need to plan better. They shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice the happiness of one child for the other.", "NTA, God NTA. I know people whoes marriage is falling apart, but they deside to have another child with exactly the purpose to have a caregiver for their disabled child. It's understandable, but still wrong. No child should suffer, because of their parents and still that's the most common thing, because we all are just a humans and we do mistakes. But you should be able doing your own one. What you said to your parents is the best, that you could ever possibly do for your sister.  No-one has the right to decide how your life is gonna be except you and even then it won't be exactly the way you imagine it. But what your parents are trying to do is despicable. Not everyone can manage taking care of another human being especially, when it wasn't your choice doing it.

Parents often give deference to kids with special needs and expect the whole family to revolve around those needs.    You can only do what you can do and sometimes being a caregiver is not in your emotional make-up.   I would just distance myself from her and do the best you can.   Your parents are ignoring your needs and they need to realize this or they're going to lose you.   Your health and well being is important too and just because she is autistic doesn't give her a pass on bad behavior.   I would encourage you to talk to a trusted teacher or counselor at school and maybe they can figure out a way to help you.", "NTA I know how it is to be an adult in a family where the parents behave like children...

You have no obligation to become her caretaker. Your parents need to get her on a waiting list for a group home where she'll be taken care of.", "No way, just because your are siblings does not means you are automatically the person who will care for your sister when your parents are unable to do do.\n\nYour parents are wrong about being patient and more caring, if someone has a disability, it doesn\u2019t mean they have, it\u2019s a free pass. They have equal responsibility to treat you as their child and not put her needs above your needs. \nThey had a responsibility to protect and listen to you and make future plans for her care if needed.\n\nAlso, they are not helping her either by not teaching her responsibility for her actions", "NTA. And don\u2019t back down. As soon as you can get some distance and don\u2019t ever go back.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents chose to have your sister, and her future care is their responsibility. You are not required to set aside your own future.", "NTA\u2026 I agree they should start looking into government programs that can maybe have a group home or some such\u2026 And if they want to oversee her care, then they really need to work on not allowing this behavior because it\u2019ll just make you move away as soon as you can.", "NTA and just a gentle reminder that it could be genetic so the decision to have kids should be very heavily considered given how you feel dealing with these issues", "NTA your sister is not your lifelong prison sentence. Your parents brought her into this world and they are 100% responsible for her. They are treating you poorly signing you up for this hell. They are throwing you under the bus for your sister.

They cannot force you when you are older without your consent so don't sign anything they send your way. \n\nSeriously though. Move away away when you are an adult and don't give them much of a contact, like email only. Parents like this are known to pull some shit. You are not responsible for their shitty choices", "Your parents are doing a terrible job.  The fact that your sister is autistic doesn't mean they can't correct her when she says horrible things to you,, and that there can't be consequences for making vicious statements.  (There's a difference between having no filter and calling your sister ugly names etc.)  This should have been going on since this meanness started.  I don't know that it would have worked perfectly, but at least you would have felt your parents noticed what was going on and had your back.\n\nYou might want to request that you and your parents, just the three of you, see a family therapist so that you can let them know how they and your sister are making you feel, and how telling you over and over to be more understanding just makes you feel (and be) victimized.  \n\nAs for you providing long-term care: no.  Your parents need to be connected with social services and get your sister into sheltered workshop work or day treatment, and prepare her for a supervised house or apartment with other DD adults as she gets older.

(I'm assuming you are in the US) You should start planning your escape from home once you turn 18. If you have a job, be sure that money goes into an account that is strictly yours (compared to a shared w/parents name). It depends on where you live whether you can get your own account or not. Also, make sure that you have your social security card in your possession. Same with your birth certificate. Both can be replaced if necessary. SS card is as easy as doing it online or going to your local SSA place. Birth certificates are a little trickier. But you should be able to go online & either find out where you need to go or do it strictly online. A certified copy would be better.

It's not sustainable to have just OP take on that responsibility alone for the rest of their life. And there's no reason to hope that OP would ever be able to maintain a healthy relationship with sister acting like this 24/7 at home.

He got it cut and styled it differently. He told her he wanted to try something new and asked if she liked it. She sat quietly for a minute and said, \"If I have nothing nice to say then I am not supposed to say anything at all.\" My son laughed and told her he would keep that in mind the next time he got a haircut. She was flabbergasted as to how he knew that she didn't like the cut because in her mind she said nothing wrong. We thought it was funny but I know my brother had a talk with her about it because she was preparing to go to college and he wanted to go over proper responses and social behaviors. \n\nShe does sometimes still have a hard time with knowing what to say and is very very honest but she has gotten better at not offending people by accident because my brother and SIL worked on it a lot with her.

I doubt he was afforded much of a childhood if this is their attitude.", "At 14 asd or not you need to have consequences for actions. Discouraging your older daughter from taking space is shitty parenting. NTA your parents suck. Their parenting sucks. OP you are not responsible for your sister.

You being a good daughter or sister does not require you to be emotionally or psychologically abused. God luck to you. Hope you update in the future.", "Agreed, NTA. I actually wonder if the reason sister is so mean is thar the parents have told her the older brother will be her caregiver and that is causing her anxiety.
