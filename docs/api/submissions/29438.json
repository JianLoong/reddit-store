I didn't mind before. But now? No. I'm not doing it. I do not have the patience to love her through all her shitty behavior. It was always there but it gets worse the older she gets and I would not be a good fit. I could not just take it and I don't want to. I don't want to take care of her.

They have no idea what to do and that is why they took the easy way out of deciding that they'd simply sacrifice the rest of your life.\n\nIt's a tough situation, but ultimately they are the ones who brought her into the world, not you. They need to come up with an actual plan for long-term care, etc.", "NTA. What a horrible situation. Your purpose in life is not to take care of your sister or be abused. While your sister may not be able to control herself, that doesn't mean her behavior is ok and it really is quite understandable that you don't want to take this on. It is incredibly mature of you to realize that you are not suitable for this task, and honestly, you are the only one making a rational, adult decision in this topic. I am sure your parents are exhausted, physically, emotionally, and financially from this. That doesn't justify their failure to protect you and be your parent too. Putting this burden on the shoulders of a 17 year old is phenomenally poor parenting.

Now, one of this sibling's offspring is also a guardian, if my sibling has health issues.  If one of us hadn't stepped up, other guardians were possible, and my parents would have worked that out.  They considered it their job.  \n\nI became guardian for someone else, a relative of my spouse, with a need for guardianship for their entire life.  Guardianship is a job.  It's not a job anyone should take on without wanting to do it.  I had this relative's abusive parent stalking me and threatening me for a while, because they weren't in control anymore.\n\nEspecially, **your parents should not be manipulating you into this job when you not even an adult yet.**  They should be focusing on what you need, what education you want, how to help you become independent and reach for your own goals.

Do you have a place you can go to stay, if your parents continue to allow your sister to abuse you like this?  Emotional and verbal abuse can take a long, long time to heal from, and the sooner you are out of your sister's reach, the healthier for you.  \n\nIf you can, get hold of your important documents.  Make up a \"go bag\" with the things you would need if you must leave their house quickly at some point.

If your parents hoped you would be willing to take care of your sister, they should have fostered a healthy sibling relationship.  That they just expected you to is awful. You\u2019re not a back-up parent, you are your own person and deserving of your own life free of their burdens. \n\nMy little brother has autism. He\u2019s 21 now. Like your sister, he\u2019s verbal and is capable of doing a lot of things but cannot live on his own. I was extremely involved in helping to raise him (I was 13 when he was born). I interned at his specialized pre-school/kindergarten, I learned how to drive a bus when I turned 18 so I could be the bus driver for him so he\u2019d go to a special summer day camp, I dressed as Santa every year so he wasn\u2019t afraid, I did a ton of stuff for and with him. When I went to college, I chose a local one so I could stay home and remain heavily involved. \n\nHe became very manipulative as he got older. When he ran away from home and showed up on my doorstep, I took him in. I lasted six weeks before I told him he had to choose a parent to live with (our mom and his dad are divorced but alive and can care for him). I told him I have children and a wife and I cannot just care for an adult disabled man who has a lot of manipulative/destructive behaviors and I can\u2019t expose my kids to it.\n\nMy mother was so angry. She told me it was \u201cmy turn\u201d with him. I reminded her that she became pregnant with him, she raised him and permitted many of his least healthy behaviors to persist, and she is his mother. We\u2019ve gone non-contact and my brother is so angry I wouldn\u2019t care for him that he doesn\u2019t talk to me either. \n\nThe truth is: caring for siblings who have autism is often completely thankless. I suspect that autism is really just brain damage caused by metal toxicity and the damage mimics the \u201cdivergence\u201d you find in people who are psychopathic. I hate to say it, but I\u2019ve never met a person with autism who has the capacity to empathize and love the way most neurotypical people can. And over the course of about 20 years, I\u2019ve met hundreds of people with autism.\n\nYou know what you never see: an AITA, I did something autism/ND-related and hurt someone.

It's entirely possible that she's an asshole that also happens to be ASD.", "Just make sure you move into a place with no filial laws, or at least weakly enforced filial laws, lest the state compel you into paying for your parents' care-giving. If you are in the US, some states will even sue across state lines to try and get payment from you.\n\nFrankly, I think filial laws are blatantly unconstitutional in the US under the 13th amendment because children do not get a choice to be born, but the case has not been successfully made in court.", "Something like that would probably help out in the long run for everyone involved. Any therapist would be glad to have more context to one of their cases. Something tells me the parents wouldn't be telling the therapist the dirty truths of their favourite child....", "Why is this literal trash being upvoted? This is disgusting.", "Thats the dumbest shit i ever read. I call BS because thats not how autism works.", "The sibling\u2019s behaviour is abusive, regardless of the reason, and OP\u2019s childhood was miserable both because of her and because of being always second because of her. OP is completely allowed to have bad, resentful feelings about it and is certainly NOT obligated to care for or be responsible for her after their parents die. That they would put that on OP\u2019s shoulders speaks volumes about them as parents and OP is completely allowed to have nothing to do with them either.", "I was thinking the same. Nose to nose and scream \"fuck off.\" But I don't think op is enabling her. He is constricted by his parents. She sounds like a nasty bully - autistic or not.", "Hi OP. I am truly sorry to read what you are going through right now so NTA. Judging from what you wrote, I believe your parents are planning to use you as a carer for your sister in the future at the expense of your well being and your own life. Do not let them guilt trip you or manipulate into thinking you are the bad guy here. Your parents actually should get appropriate help for your sister and they have no right to disrespect your boundaries and feelings\n\nBe very careful and if you are planning to apply to enter university next year, make sure your application and approval letters are ONLY posted to your friends' or workplace postal address in case the parents find the acceptance letter and withhold/destroy it to stop you from going to uni. Do look into applying for scholarships, bursaries and/or financial aid that will help you with uni and make sure you talk to your teachers or school counsellors on this\n\nOP, you said you are 17 this year right? I am going to give you some advice before you turn 18. For starters whatever money you earn from your job, keep on saving as much as you can and keep the money somewhere safe so that the moment you turn 18 and move out, your parents cannot stop you from moving out and they cannot touch your money \n\nYou will be 18 in a year's time so be very prepared now to find out who you can move to live with temporarily until you find a suitable place to live/rent for yourself. Do talk to your bosses, coworkers, relatives and/or friends where you can rent or live the moment you turn 18. You can slowly transport some of your possessions e.g. clothing, school certificates etc to friends or bosses for safekeeping so that you do not have to pack in a panic while moving out the moment you turn 18. The minute you turn 18, go to the nearest police station and tell them you are moving out at your own volition and you are not running away or kidnapped so that your parents cannot waste police's time and resources claiming you ran away from home or kidnapped. \n\nI suggest you get in touch with a social worker, a medical expert or a legal expert to ensure that your parents cannot legally make you become your sister's guardian or caregiver behind your back without your knowledge if something happens to them. From what you wrote, by right your sister should be in a long term residential care facility when she comes of age and your parents can no longer care for her in the future \n\nGive us an update OP", "OPs behavior is clearly as abusive, yet we look past that. OP is being abused by his parents because they tell him to be more patient? Like I said, we don't have the full narrative of the story. He is an angry teen. He can't have what he wants. What I recommend OP is getting involved in groups with families of disabilities to learn from people who are actually involved with autistic children. Learn how to manage your life as a sibling of a person in the spectrum. You are not alone and not the only one going through this, OP.", "At schools you run into this quite often, where parents expect the teachers to teach behavior and manners, but also want to fuss if they feel the teachers are too harsh. \n\nMy wife worked at a day care where the parents expected the workers to potty train their children, but offered no reinforcement at home so the only potty training the little ones were getting was the 9 or 10 hours they were at day care. It was very sad.", "I know an autistic girl the same age, and she's absolutely the sweetest and most loving kid. She'll occasionally say something that is pretty blunt or unintentionally hurtful, but since she doesn't actually *want* to hurt anyone, it's very easy for her mom to explain why that wasn't a good thing to say and she doesn't do it again.\n\nMeanwhile, OP's parents are emotionally abusing OP by proxy by allowing these comments to go unchecked and unremarked on, and by forbidding OP to protect themself.\n\nThey're doing both kids a massive disservice by blaming their abuse on autism.", "Explain how OPs behaviour is abusive. Go ahead.", "Dont give me attitude because you don't agree with me.\n\nIt's only obvious that he would not just stay quiet as his sister is having a tantrum. Do you think his parents would tell him anything if he was actually patient? In his last sentence, he says his parents have said this is the worst he has treated his sister. This whole post screams that he is just abusive. He is an angry teenager because his parents had their hands full with his sister. He should reach out to help groups instead of reddit.", "He also says in the post that he removes himself from the situation the majority of the time. That says the opposite of abuse. Of course his parents think he treats her bad because he\u2019s not kind and entertaining of her and forgiving.", "Yeah, I never said vaccines cause autism. You assumed that. I said it\u2019s metal toxicity, which all of these confirm. There\u2019s very little debate about that at this point. There\u2019s also no question that vaccines contain heavy metals. I wouldn\u2019t shoot that into my child. \n\nI never said you have autism. I said it\u2019s hard to accept that autism manifests similarly to sociopathy and psychopathy. It\u2019s particularly hard for autistic people to accept. I didn\u2019t say anything about you.", "Look, my man, I don't know if you ever dealt with special needs children, but what OP needs is to seek help for the situation he is in. Some counseling and group help for people with special needs siblings. I understand he can totally remove himself from his family, but my personal opinion is that it is your family. You're barely 17, and you don't know enough yet.", "Except you responded with these links to a conversation where I called you an anti-vaxer (directly referenced your specific post ), where you talked about not vaccinating your kids ( as part of parents who had experience with autistic people)? Where you called me a big pharma supporter?\nDo you not see how that looks? And you confirm that you believe metals in vaccines can cause negative effects?\n\nIf you're going to take a stance then stand by it, don't \"partially \" backtrack it and pretend you never took it.\n\nAlso your comment about acceptance was unclear, I apologize for misunderstanding it,in the context of our conversation it seemed like that to me. I will concede on that one.", "I\u2019m not a man, first of all. Second, I\u2019m in social services so I certainly have. I have also had abusive family members and people like you telling me they\u2019re blood and to forgive and forget and blaming me for the abuse and that causes a lot of trauma. So congratulations. You\u2019re part of the trauma cycle."]}
