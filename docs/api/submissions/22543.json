By \"kindly asking\" you're presuming that you & your child are more important/deserving and you're putting the other person in the uncomfortable situation (unless you're asking only the very last person in line) of speaking for everyone else in the queue (many of whom may have their own pressing needs).  Just wait in line like everyone else or take your \"screaming\" toddler somewhere to calm down & then get in line.", "Sure, I respect your opinion. I just think differently. I hope this is allowed here", "Of course it's allowed, but having an unrealistic sense of entitlement isn't an \"opinion.\" And your claim that \"people with children do get priority in line\" was stated as fact and it isn't."]}
