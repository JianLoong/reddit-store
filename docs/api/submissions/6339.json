Your BIL wife made a tasteless comment, and she made herself the asshole by pushing the conversation even more when you were against the comment and took offence to it.  The conversation became very inappropriate once you showed how uncomfortable you were.\n\nOn the other hand, you are failing to see that you are a nepotism baby.  Your family started a business and you got to experience as easier time getting your first job out of college because of it.  It is very possible that you did a lot of hard work to get yourself that job and it is also possible that someone else just as qualified for the same job got passed over because your family owns the company.  You did nothing wrong by taking the job and your family have not done anything wrong by giving you the job.  But you should recognize that you were lucky to receive a privilege in life that most people don't get to have.", "NTA she was out of line, however she was correct, your situation is definitely nepotism, it doesn\u2019t just apply to celebrities.", "ESH i feel like she took it too far but like, you are a nepotism baby, the literal definition of nepotism is \"the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives, friends, or associates, especially by giving them jobs\" if your dad owns/runs/whatever the business he has influence and he gave you a job", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with working in the family business. But if you make significant money and were hired by your family, then you have to at least take a joke about being a nepotism baby. It doesn't have to be true, but you have to be able to laugh it off.", "ESH. Your BIL's wife was being inappropriate, in my opinion. However...you did get your first job as a result of nepotism. Was BIL's wife wrong to point this out? I'm not sure she was given you did essentially try to argue that your case is somehow different to actors etc. You didn't seem to find the conversation 'wildly inappropriate' until it was pointed out to you that nepotism doesn't only exist amongst the rich and famous.", "ESH - Of course you're the beneficiary of nepotism.

Were you hired based on your experience and education and were you automatically plopped into a higher rank upon graduation, or did you have to start from the bottom in the mailroom so to speak and work your way up within the company chain on your own?\n\nOn the outside it absolutely comes off as nepotism without knowing how you reached the position you're currently in.  You're offended bc you feel you're being compared to people who likely didn't \"work\" to get where they are and seemingly reached their success based solely on the fame of their parents... I don't know what article you referencing, as I didn't read it... I feel like the Kardashians are famous for being famous. Paris Hilton is an heiress, but she does \"work\", sing and model for her money.  Both could be seen at nepotism within their families...

It was rude of her to put you on the spot in front of everyone, and passive-aggressive to try to couch it as a \"joke.\" You stayed out of the conversation, deflected when she first called you out, and only shut her down when she wouldn't let it go.

When said you thought that comment was a little ridiculous, that's when she could have said \"it was only a joke.\" Instead she doubled down then dropped your income in mixed company. That's not cool.\n\nIncidentally, she's wrong. Nepotism is about preferential hiring in government or in an industry that's supposed to be open (especially publicly traded companies where people who make hiring decisions have a fiduciary duty to shareholders), not small family businesses. When a parent hands a small business off to their child, it often cuts both ways. Sometimes you're putting in more sweat equity up front and inheriting more liabilities than someone would be willing to accept in any arm's length transaction. I don't know whether that's been the case for you, but it's just another reason for people to mind their own business.", "I'm gonna go against the grain here and see ESH with a tiny bit leaning towards Y T A.

She was making a generalized conversation topic into a personal attack - whether out of malicious intent or just blind stupidity, the result was the same: an inappropriate public airing of your personal financial business.  She made the conversation awkward and rude.

You did nothing wrong.", "YTA and you are the definition of a nepo baby lol", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nHer last chance to plausibly play the \"just joking\" card was when you asked her to explain what she meant. By responding seriously at that point and adding more details such as your yearly income, she made it abundantly clear that she was serious.", "NTA.  BIL\u2019s wife sounds jealous.  Her \u201cjoke\u201d was clearly a personal dig.  She should mind her own business.  Mentioning your salary at a party was crass.\n\nYou did not specify the type of business you work for, but family owned businesses are complex.  Most entrepreneurs want to pass on their companies to the next generation.  Children often begin learning the business before finishing high school, go to trade school or college to get the proper education, and assume a lot of debt to fund the transfer of ownership.  After all that, there is no guarantee of success.\n\n\u201cNepotism\u201d happens in government and publicly traded companies.  It generally doesn\u2019t apply to privately owned businesses, celebrities or athletes.\n\nI did not read the article.  So what if a lot of athletes and entertainers successfully follow in their parents\u2019 footsteps?  If they inherited talent and physical attributes, understood the professional culture, were tutored by experts from the time they could walk, had a strong work ethic, and knew the right people - then of course they have a higher chance of success than the average Joe.

It\u2019s one of those had to be there nuances I\u2019d imagine. \n\nIt can be true and also meant as a joke. End of the day it comes down to your relationships and norms. Would she normally joke like this? Your family? Is this a known sore spot for you? Etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently offensive.

If your dad\u2019s business has a nepotism policy for example and he did hire you - maybe she is throwing a jab.\n\nAnyway good luck with it all, just remember we can all get a little sensitive when family is involved in our lives into adulthood - it is still a beautiful thing to have and you chose it for a reason.

If the person was qualified, and/or their is no fiduciary duty, i.e., it is your business, not something you are running on behalf of someone (or many many someone\u2019s), then hire away. Give away the farm.  A good test is can I sell the business and give away the assets? If yes, then it\u2019s yours.  I read that this concept became a moral issue when people objected to popes (not being disrespectful to Catholicism, just giving background as this happened centuries ago) gave out promotions/offices to family rather than to the most deserving, which did NOT benefit the church.  \nThe reason that nepotism is a problem is when you violate a duty to your employer/organization when you are in a position of trust whereby you should look out for the best interests of that organization.  That\u2019s why it was/is considered \u201csinful.\u201d  \nIt was never meant to apply to family businesses, many of which would not flourish without the help of the family.  Does that mean that crappy kid gets hired? Yep. Does the business suffer? Yep. But that loss is borne by the family that put the kid in the job. It\u2019s basically your risk if you hire the family, and you suffer or rise with it,   That is not morally objectionable, nor nepotism.

It's too frequent to work for years in a company that goes bad when the stupid son of the owner starts to run it.", "But he is lol", "In other words, only OP cares.", "Nepotism is where you wouldn't have gotten the job without being family.\n\nDid you start work through an open position you applied for, with other candidates your dad considered equally?\n\nIf not, your job is the product of nepotism, and you need to accept that.\n\nNepotism isn't even a bad thing, it's just a privilege you need to acknowledge as it's not something most people have.  I'd argue in many cases it's a good thing, as hiring a known quantity is a safe choice.", "Honestly your NTA we aren't here for you not recognizing your nepotism she didn't have a right to put you out like that and it's not a joke if your not laughing or even engaged in the conversation NTA at all op", "But why does he suck?", "The only definition is getting jobs, favors, and/or benefits by particular virtue of being related to the person bestowing them on you, so yes. A family business would definitely fall under that tree, as the children are specifically being given jobs to keep the business in the family. \n\nNot all nepotism is high-stakes, high pay, prestigious, or even particularly negative. It could mean an actor getting their kid into roles by calling in favors, or just some guy willing to train and hire his kid into the family plumbing business over an outsider. \n\nNepotism is just the acknowledgment that your connection played a part in getting you something you may not have otherwise.", "Literally yes. Giving relatives jobs is the definition of nepotism. \n\nBut this sounds like it is more than a family business and that more than just family works in this business. OP graduated college and then his dad gave him a job \u2014 nowhere did he say it was a family business and typically you don\u2019t need a degree for a family business.", "Cheers! I'm a crony for sure.", "> They have zero need to acknowledge that fact for other people\n\nI have zero need to acknowledge that the sky is blue. But my refusing to do so won't make it less true and refusing to do so will probably make me look silly to 3rd parties.\n\nNepotism is bad. Meritocracy is good. Individual circumstances are their own and more complex than a simple dichotomy but Nepotism is bad and people in these situations know that - or else it would be as trivial a detail as \"the sky is blue.\"", "I make 100,000 and my business has 2 employees (me being 1 of them) - I would def say we are a tiny business", "When I graduated, I had an offer to go work for an international company for 3x the money my father gave me.. I took the job with my dad to help him with the company... I was the lowest paid employee in the company and always was put aside in the job... I lasted there 7 years and learned nothing of value.. I left after 7 years, starting from scratch at a different company with higher pay than I got 7 years with my dad... people need to understand that not all \"nepotism babies\" benefit from the jobs, so not everyone should go in the same basket", "Because he denies being a nepo baby", "There's no guarantee they even have an advantage. They could be making LESS money than someone in their position at another company, something that happens a lot in small family businesses. Simply being at a family company is not always an advantage or privilege. Sometimes it's something you just do to help your family lol. I think a lot of people have had that experience.", "No because you don't always have an advantage by working at a small family company. Sometimes you're giving up more than you're getting. Most small family businesses are really not that successful.", "You have an insight view because you are also a nepotism baby, that\u2019s why she asked you.", "You could have spoken on your experience being granted opportunity simply from family lineage\u2026 that\u2019s like the whole point\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter how big or small the opportunity is", "Nepotism is not \"average experience\". You are really trying to downplay the immense privilege you have had in life over the vast majority of others.\n\nMy vote was E S H but if you are this obtuse in general then I change it to Y T A and no wonder your SIL does not like you.", "You do realize that celebrities are humans like us..\n\n..and celebrity is a component of their job, that they use to get their kids jobs/roles..\n\n..just like your dad give you a job based on him running his company.\n\nNepotism doesn\u2019t have a tax bracket, and how successful they are at leveraging that nepotism doesn\u2019t make or break if it\u2019s classified as so.\n\nYTA, acknowledging your privilege while simultaneously excusing it away on this topic isn\u2019t actually acknowledging anything. **\u2018Yes I\u2019m privileged and got a job in my dads field at his company easily simply because my dad owned the company, but we didn\u2019t fly pjs and he couldn\u2019t get me cast on House of Dragon so it doesn\u2019t count, right?\u2019** does not show a great deal of introspection.", "She literally asked for your pov as a nepotism baby which you *do* have & it makes her asking a bit more logical than it would if you hadn't been hired simply because you're your dad's child. How is that confusing? She shouldn't have told your income & accepted that you weren't interested in giving your pov, but you aren't so naive not to understand why she asked to begin with.", "Let me give you a very simple example.\n\nMy mother worked at a pizza place. She was just a cashier, but she was friends with the manager. When I turned sixteen, my application got bumped up a little because my mother was pushing the manager (a friend) to get my a job. It was minimum wage and I hated it the entire time I was there and still hate it to this day, but it was *absolutely* a job I got through lowkey nepotism. I probably would have gotten it without her (they were desperate for help) but my mother whispering in the manager's ear basically guaranteed it for me. Is it glamorous or glitzy? No, it sucked. Was it still nepotism? Yeah, kind of. Experience may very, but the core idea is always the same", "Ah, yes. The SIL brought up the nepotism and the good money OP makes because he is struggling helping out his dad by taking the job his dad gave him. Makes total sense.\n\nAgain, nowhere does the post say this is a small family business. In context, it sounds like a mid sized or bigger business where his dad was able to get him a job.", "She didnt even say how much money lmao. To some people $50k a year is \"rich\". My mom was a waitress her whole life and thought I was rich when I was making $50k a year at my job. I was underpaid by $50k.", "She did say it was beyond normal supporting themselves money so he\u2019s obviously not struggling.", "I agree, we don\u2019t really know if working for family was his choice either or if he felt pressured. Just seems weird to me to shove a label for something that\u2019s not really hurting anyone else down someone\u2019s throat and expect them to take it gracefully, when you don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s a particularly beneficial situation for them or not."]}
