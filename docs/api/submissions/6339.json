Your BIL wife made a tasteless comment, and she made herself the asshole by pushing the conversation even more when you were against the comment and took offence to it.  The conversation became very inappropriate once you showed how uncomfortable you were.\n\nOn the other hand, you are failing to see that you are a nepotism baby.  Your family started a business and you got to experience as easier time getting your first job out of college because of it.  It is very possible that you did a lot of hard work to get yourself that job and it is also possible that someone else just as qualified for the same job got passed over because your family owns the company.  You did nothing wrong by taking the job and your family have not done anything wrong by giving you the job.  But you should recognize that you were lucky to receive a privilege in life that most people don't get to have.", "NTA she was out of line, however she was correct, your situation is definitely nepotism, it doesn\u2019t just apply to celebrities.", "ESH i feel like she took it too far but like, you are a nepotism baby, the literal definition of nepotism is \"the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives, friends, or associates, especially by giving them jobs\" if your dad owns/runs/whatever the business he has influence and he gave you a job", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with working in the family business. But if you make significant money and were hired by your family, then you have to at least take a joke about being a nepotism baby. It doesn't have to be true, but you have to be able to laugh it off.", "ESH. Your BIL's wife was being inappropriate, in my opinion. However...you did get your first job as a result of nepotism. Was BIL's wife wrong to point this out? I'm not sure she was given you did essentially try to argue that your case is somehow different to actors etc. You didn't seem to find the conversation 'wildly inappropriate' until it was pointed out to you that nepotism doesn't only exist amongst the rich and famous.", "ESH - Of course you're the beneficiary of nepotism. You knew it, and you misrepresented the situation to pretend you weren't. Your friend wasn't an AH for adding more information (your salary) when correcting your lie and defending her own honesty.

I feel like you tried to start a side-convo & ignore this one because deep down you knew, that was you, and you didn't want to be called out. \n\nYou could've owned up to it and shut her down by saying \"I understand that I'm very priveleged & fortunate to have been given a job by my father in his company, but I believe through my hard work & abilities & results, I have shown that I belong  there & not just coasting on things being handed to me.\" That would've shut her down & made you look like you were self-aware", "YTA and a nepo baby.", "YTa because you are a nepo baby", "YTA.

Were you hired based on your experience and education and were you automatically plopped into a higher rank upon graduation, or did you have to start from the bottom in the mailroom so to speak and work your way up within the company chain on your own?\n\nOn the outside it absolutely comes off as nepotism without knowing how you reached the position you're currently in.  You're offended bc you feel you're being compared to people who likely didn't \"work\" to get where they are and seemingly reached their success based solely on the fame of their parents... I don't know what article you referencing, as I didn't read it... I feel like the Kardashians are famous for being famous. Paris Hilton is an heiress, but she does \"work\", sing and model for her money.  Both could be seen at nepotism within their families... The same could be said for Miley Cyrus and Collin Hanks, even though they both work... Would they have been famous without the success of their parents?\n\nI kind of feel you're taking it a bit too personally but that's without knowing how you actually got your position.

It was rude of her to put you on the spot in front of everyone, and passive-aggressive to try to couch it as a \"joke.\" You stayed out of the conversation, deflected when she first called you out, and only shut her down when she wouldn't let it go.

Wasn\u2019t a joke someone\u2019s jealous.", "NTA\n\nIf it was just a joke she could have backed down. When said you thought that comment was a little ridiculous, that's when she could have said \"it was only a joke.\" Instead she doubled down then dropped your income in mixed company. That's not cool.\n\nIncidentally, she's wrong. Nepotism is about preferential hiring in government or in an industry that's supposed to be open (especially publicly traded companies where people who make hiring decisions have a fiduciary duty to shareholders), not small family businesses. When a parent hands a small business off to their child, it often cuts both ways. Sometimes you're putting in more sweat equity up front and inheriting more liabilities than someone would be willing to accept in any arm's length transaction. I don't know whether that's been the case for you, but it's just another reason for people to mind their own business.", "I'm gonna go against the grain here and see ESH with a tiny bit leaning towards Y T A. Your BIL's wife made a comment not in great taste, and she was a bit of an A H for pushing it further when you made it obvious you were uncomfortable with it. However, you are a nepo baby with no sense of humor, for that you are also an A H for overreacting.", "OP is a nepo-baby with no sense of humor.", "NTA. She was making a generalized conversation topic into a personal attack - whether out of malicious intent or just blind stupidity, the result was the same: an inappropriate public airing of your personal financial business.  She made the conversation awkward and rude. Her trying to pass it off as a 'joke' just made it worse - that was her embarrassed way of trying to dodge ownership of a line of questioning that was turning sour. You did nothing wrong.", "YTA and you are the definition of a nepo baby lol", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nHer last chance to plausibly play the \"just joking\" card was when you asked her to explain what she meant. By responding seriously at that point and adding more details such as your yearly income, she made it abundantly clear that she was serious.", "NTA.  BIL\u2019s wife sounds jealous.  Her \u201cjoke\u201d was clearly a personal dig.  She should mind her own business.  Mentioning your salary at a party was crass.\n\nYou did not specify the type of business you work for, but family owned businesses are complex.  Most entrepreneurs want to pass on their companies to the next generation.  Children often begin learning the business before finishing high school, go to trade school or college to get the proper education, and assume a lot of debt to fund the transfer of ownership.  After all that, there is no guarantee of success.\n\n\u201cNepotism\u201d happens in government and publicly traded companies.  It generally doesn\u2019t apply to privately owned businesses, celebrities or athletes.\n\nI did not read the article.  So what if a lot of athletes and entertainers successfully follow in their parents\u2019 footsteps?  If they inherited talent and physical attributes, understood the professional culture, were tutored by experts from the time they could walk, had a strong work ethic, and knew the right people - then of course they have a higher chance of success than the average Joe.

It\u2019s one of those had to be there nuances I\u2019d imagine. \n\nIt can be true and also meant as a joke. End of the day it comes down to your relationships and norms. Would she normally joke like this? Your family? Is this a known sore spot for you? Etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently offensive. But if i were her (and the tone you had was not confronting) I\u2019d have simply said \u2018you know, cause you work for your Dad - it\u2019s a joke ;)\u2019 - to affirm the joke over the definition. If you confront me I would start defining things and start a dialogue which moves away from the joke.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re good at what you do, not saying you didn\u2019t have merit, but you do factually work for your dad.

If your dad\u2019s business has a nepotism policy for example and he did hire you - maybe she is throwing a jab.\n\nAnyway good luck with it all, just remember we can all get a little sensitive when family is involved in our lives into adulthood - it is still a beautiful thing to have and you chose it for a reason.
