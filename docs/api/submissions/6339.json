Your BIL wife made a tasteless comment, and she made herself the asshole by pushing the conversation even more when you were against the comment and took offence to it.  The conversation became very inappropriate once you showed how uncomfortable you were.\n\nOn the other hand, you are failing to see that you are a nepotism baby.  Your family started a business and you got to experience as easier time getting your first job out of college because of it.  It is very possible that you did a lot of hard work to get yourself that job and it is also possible that someone else just as qualified for the same job got passed over because your family owns the company.  You did nothing wrong by taking the job and your family have not done anything wrong by giving you the job.  But you should recognize that you were lucky to receive a privilege in life that most people don't get to have.", "NTA she was out of line, however she was correct, your situation is definitely nepotism, it doesn\u2019t just apply to celebrities.", "ESH i feel like she took it too far but like, you are a nepotism baby, the literal definition of nepotism is \"the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives, friends, or associates, especially by giving them jobs\" if your dad owns/runs/whatever the business he has influence and he gave you a job", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with working in the family business. But if you make significant money and were hired by your family, then you have to at least take a joke about being a nepotism baby. It doesn't have to be true, but you have to be able to laugh it off.", "ESH. Your BIL's wife was being inappropriate, in my opinion. However...you did get your first job as a result of nepotism. Was BIL's wife wrong to point this out? I'm not sure she was given you did essentially try to argue that your case is somehow different to actors etc. You didn't seem to find the conversation 'wildly inappropriate' until it was pointed out to you that nepotism doesn't only exist amongst the rich and famous.", "ESH - Of course you're the beneficiary of nepotism.

Were you hired based on your experience and education and were you automatically plopped into a higher rank upon graduation, or did you have to start from the bottom in the mailroom so to speak and work your way up within the company chain on your own?\n\nOn the outside it absolutely comes off as nepotism without knowing how you reached the position you're currently in.  You're offended bc you feel you're being compared to people who likely didn't \"work\" to get where they are and seemingly reached their success based solely on the fame of their parents... I don't know what article you referencing, as I didn't read it... I feel like the Kardashians are famous for being famous. Paris Hilton is an heiress, but she does \"work\", sing and model for her money.  Both could be seen at nepotism within their families... The same could be said for Miley Cyrus and Collin Hanks, even though they both work...

It was rude of her to put you on the spot in front of everyone, and passive-aggressive to try to couch it as a \"joke.\" You stayed out of the conversation, deflected when she first called you out, and only shut her down when she wouldn't let it go.

When said you thought that comment was a little ridiculous, that's when she could have said \"it was only a joke.\" Instead she doubled down then dropped your income in mixed company. That's not cool.\n\nIncidentally, she's wrong. Nepotism is about preferential hiring in government or in an industry that's supposed to be open (especially publicly traded companies where people who make hiring decisions have a fiduciary duty to shareholders), not small family businesses. When a parent hands a small business off to their child, it often cuts both ways. Sometimes you're putting in more sweat equity up front and inheriting more liabilities than someone would be willing to accept in any arm's length transaction. I don't know whether that's been the case for you, but it's just another reason for people to mind their own business.", "I'm gonna go against the grain here and see ESH with a tiny bit leaning towards Y T A.

She was making a generalized conversation topic into a personal attack - whether out of malicious intent or just blind stupidity, the result was the same: an inappropriate public airing of your personal financial business.  She made the conversation awkward and rude.

You did nothing wrong.", "YTA and you are the definition of a nepo baby lol", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nHer last chance to plausibly play the \"just joking\" card was when you asked her to explain what she meant. By responding seriously at that point and adding more details such as your yearly income, she made it abundantly clear that she was serious.", "NTA.  BIL\u2019s wife sounds jealous.  Her \u201cjoke\u201d was clearly a personal dig.  She should mind her own business.  Mentioning your salary at a party was crass.\n\nYou did not specify the type of business you work for, but family owned businesses are complex.  Most entrepreneurs want to pass on their companies to the next generation.  Children often begin learning the business before finishing high school, go to trade school or college to get the proper education, and assume a lot of debt to fund the transfer of ownership.  After all that, there is no guarantee of success.\n\n\u201cNepotism\u201d happens in government and publicly traded companies.  It generally doesn\u2019t apply to privately owned businesses, celebrities or athletes.\n\nI did not read the article.  So what if a lot of athletes and entertainers successfully follow in their parents\u2019 footsteps?  If they inherited talent and physical attributes, understood the professional culture, were tutored by experts from the time they could walk, had a strong work ethic, and knew the right people - then of course they have a higher chance of success than the average Joe.

It\u2019s one of those had to be there nuances I\u2019d imagine. \n\nIt can be true and also meant as a joke. End of the day it comes down to your relationships and norms. Would she normally joke like this? Your family? Is this a known sore spot for you? Etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently offensive.

If your dad\u2019s business has a nepotism policy for example and he did hire you - maybe she is throwing a jab.\n\nAnyway good luck with it all, just remember we can all get a little sensitive when family is involved in our lives into adulthood - it is still a beautiful thing to have and you chose it for a reason.

Also, talk to your husband about boundaries, because I'll bet that he is the one that shared your financial info.", "NTA, but your job is entirely the result of nepotism and you should resign yourself to the reality that people will think you\u2019re less qualified for your job than someone who had to apply for it.

Of course your older family members in the same profession gave you a leg up, that\u2019s human nature.\n\nHelping with the family business, being a part of the same trade or profession, or anything in between is not a negative thing.

That's normal. And even kind of polite.\n\nBut you tried to play oblivious innocent, when you should have just owned it.

People could have said my dad got his job because his name was on the business, but they ignore that he was essentially a child laborer and forced to work in the company starting at age 10. He worked his way up from a laborer to a contractor to owner. And mostly because his father was running the business into the ground and he had to save it. It was more a duty than a privilege. There was no one else to run it. He wishes he could have done something else, which is why he sold the company and encouraged all of his kids to never go into the same business outside of giving us our first summer jobs (which were definitely nepotism).", "I dont see how luck has anything to do with it. For example, I work in a small buisness. There is our boss and 6 employees. His son will take over when he retires. No one got passed over because there was no opening where anyone could have been passed over. Because in a family owned business you cant apply as 'successor'. You need to be be part of the family for that job, literally. So nobody lost anything and no one was lucky or unlucky. Btw, he started to work at the business after our boss announced that he will retire in a few years. Before he worked for another company but in the same industry. I mean, its nepotism but I dont understand why people think they are allowed to insult them for it. To be honest, I am happy that he is taking over. It means I dont lose the job I love and my living standard because we get paid way more than the average in the industry. So yeah no problem with 'nepotism' in general. Doesnt matter if he earns 50x what I earn. I only could earn more if I opened my own business.", "Why would that make the OP an AH? Even though it is true, he still doesn't want to talk about it.", "Yes this is true but the implication is usually that the OP is unqualified, incapable or undeserving of the job and stole it from someone else. That\u2019s the appeal of mocking nepotism. Just because someone makes a joke, and the contents of the joke are accurate doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be said. You\u2019re still mocking someone who hasn\u2019t really done anything wrong and singling someone out like that is cruel.

Even if it wasnt true they could just laugh it off though I guess.", "Yes. All family businesses are run on nepotism. Not \"technically\". That's EXACTLY what it is.", "Where is the joke in telling people how much someone else makes without their consent?", "I feel like she used the current celebrity fad of calling out nepo-babies in order to call out OP without it sounding like she has been wanting to take this dig at OP.", "While it was used as an attack OP has benefited from nepotism.  Nepo baby is pretty rude imo but saying him being hired at his dads business isn't nepotism just isn't true.  Same with other people in family businesses.  They were hired because they were family.", "Just for clarification: I don\u2019t think her intentions were polite at all when she was \u201cchecking in\u201d on me. If she had done it privately then maybe I could understand that perspective, but this felt malicious.", "Agreed with you.

We had marching groups--squads--of 4-5 people, each with a squad leader. Squad leaders reported to section leaders (grouped by instrument--we had 3 squads of flute in one section--or by type, such as low brass) who were in charge of 3-4 squads. They reported to the two Drum Majors, who were 100% in charge of the band in the director's absence. We played at many sporting events, so people who'd miss performances for games were ineligible.\n\nMy sophomore year, I was made a squad leader. It was explained in detail to me, and anyone who asked, it was practicality more than nepotism: five people playing one instrument made up a squad, the people older than me were in sports, and the other person my age still didn't know his right from his left. I was made a section leader as a junior for similar reasons. I wasn't the first or last person to get those positions because of circumstance more than merit, and I worked every bit as hard in those positions as people who'd asked for them (squad leader usually didn't require much more than that to get). \n\nAt the same school were a few other teachers with kids. One kid attended a science class of his father's every year and got perfect grades. He was smart, but I was in at least one class with him, and he wasn't set-the-curve smart (I was, two or three times) or an A student in any other class.\n\nTeen!Me would be offended if you tried to compare our two situations.

That's nepotism.", "They should and it\u2019s fine, but the recipients of the privilege should acknowledge that the privilege exists.", "Which is hilarious because I have some nepo-baby friends and they will hands down tell you nepotism is the best thing and they wish everyone had it.

Just the rich but not super rich or the middle class ones. It's still nepotism.
