Your BIL wife made a tasteless comment, and she made herself the asshole by pushing the conversation even more when you were against the comment and took offence to it.  The conversation became very inappropriate once you showed how uncomfortable you were.\n\nOn the other hand, you are failing to see that you are a nepotism baby.  Your family started a business and you got to experience as easier time getting your first job out of college because of it.  It is very possible that you did a lot of hard work to get yourself that job and it is also possible that someone else just as qualified for the same job got passed over because your family owns the company.  You did nothing wrong by taking the job and your family have not done anything wrong by giving you the job.  But you should recognize that you were lucky to receive a privilege in life that most people don't get to have.\n\nEdit: I understand that people may not like the term and yes the term itself is usually used in a negative way.  I believe the OP is in the wrong by not seeing how nepotism does apply to them.  They seem to generally think nepotism happens with the rich and famous only, I want to make OP aware that the small business and hard working people can fall into nepotism as well.", "NTA she was out of line, however she was correct, your situation is definitely nepotism, it doesn\u2019t just apply to celebrities.", "ESH i feel like she took it too far but like, you are a nepotism baby, the literal definition of nepotism is \"the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives, friends, or associates, especially by giving them jobs\" if your dad owns/runs/whatever the business he has influence and he gave you a job", "YTA.

I don't know what article you referencing, as I didn't read it... I feel like the Kardashians are famous for being famous. Paris Hilton is an heiress, but she does \"work\", sing and model for her money.  Both could be seen at nepotism within their families... The same could be said for Miley Cyrus and Collin Hanks, even though they both work...

When said you thought that comment was a little ridiculous, that's when she could have said \"it was only a joke.\" Instead she doubled down then dropped your income in mixed company. That's not cool.\n\nIncidentally, she's wrong. Nepotism is about preferential hiring in government or in an industry that's supposed to be open (especially publicly traded companies where people who make hiring decisions have a fiduciary duty to shareholders), not small family businesses. When a parent hands a small business off to their child, it often cuts both ways. Sometimes you're putting in more sweat equity up front and inheriting more liabilities than someone would be willing to accept in any arm's length transaction. I don't know whether that's been the case for you, but it's just another reason for people to mind their own business.", "I'm gonna go against the grain here and see ESH with a tiny bit leaning towards Y T A.

She was making a generalized conversation topic into a personal attack - whether out of malicious intent or just blind stupidity, the result was the same: an inappropriate public airing of your personal financial business.  She made the conversation awkward and rude.

You did nothing wrong.", "YTA and you are the definition of a nepo baby lol", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nHer last chance to plausibly play the \"just joking\" card was when you asked her to explain what she meant. By responding seriously at that point and adding more details such as your yearly income, she made it abundantly clear that she was serious.", "NTA.  BIL\u2019s wife sounds jealous.  Her \u201cjoke\u201d was clearly a personal dig.  She should mind her own business.  Mentioning your salary at a party was crass.\n\nYou did not specify the type of business you work for, but family owned businesses are complex.  Most entrepreneurs want to pass on their companies to the next generation.  Children often begin learning the business before finishing high school, go to trade school or college to get the proper education, and assume a lot of debt to fund the transfer of ownership.  After all that, there is no guarantee of success.\n\n\u201cNepotism\u201d happens in government and publicly traded companies.  It generally doesn\u2019t apply to privately owned businesses, celebrities or athletes.\n\nI did not read the article.  So what if a lot of athletes and entertainers successfully follow in their parents\u2019 footsteps?  If they inherited talent and physical attributes, understood the professional culture, were tutored by experts from the time they could walk, had a strong work ethic, and knew the right people - then of course they have a higher chance of success than the average Joe.

It\u2019s one of those had to be there nuances I\u2019d imagine. \n\nIt can be true and also meant as a joke. End of the day it comes down to your relationships and norms. Would she normally joke like this? Your family? Is this a known sore spot for you? Etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently offensive.

If you confront me I would start defining things and start a dialogue which moves away from the joke.

If your dad\u2019s business has a nepotism policy for example and he did hire you - maybe she is throwing a jab.\n\nAnyway good luck with it all, just remember we can all get a little sensitive when family is involved in our lives into adulthood - it is still a beautiful thing to have and you chose it for a reason.

It is using your status to do something not in the best interest of the company or organization, but that benefits you personally. It is a form of breach of fiduciary duty.  If the person was qualified, and/or their is no fiduciary duty, i.e., it is your business, not something you are running on behalf of someone (or many many someone\u2019s), then hire away. Give away the farm.  A good test is can I sell the business and give away the assets? If yes, then it\u2019s yours.  I read that this concept became a moral issue when people objected to popes (not being disrespectful to Catholicism, just giving background as this happened centuries ago) gave out promotions/offices to family rather than to the most deserving, which did NOT benefit the church.  \nThe reason that nepotism is a problem is when you violate a duty to your employer/organization when you are in a position of trust whereby you should look out for the best interests of that organization.  That\u2019s why it was/is considered \u201csinful.\u201d  \nIt was never meant to apply to family businesses, many of which would not flourish without the help of the family.  Does that mean that crappy kid gets hired? Yep. Does the business suffer? Yep. But that loss is borne by the family that put the kid in the job. It\u2019s basically your risk if you hire the family, and you suffer or rise with it,   That is not morally objectionable, nor nepotism.
