Said look you think it's fair that (name), your adopted mom (grandmother) and me are the ONLY ones cleaning up after every family gathering. It's the same 3 people cooking cleaning, washing dishes now admittedly your dad did do the dishes when he was alive but that was years ago, we also put food away while you and adult kids or their gf/bf or friends  sit around laughing or get to immediately leave because they don't want to help. Yet if I even say hey I'd rather not go as it's so much work I get complained at or guilted into going with the promise everyone will help. The last time it happened  I lost my cool and said I've been here for a good 4 hours trying to help Why don't you lead by example and the get some  other adults including the kids or their partners to wash some damn dishes or rotate chores a bit to make it easier on your mom's and mek for a change. It isn't just a women's job I am not your slave as you so often tell me at home yet at your mom's you all act like I'm the free unpaid maid to order around..  \n\nGTFO with the crap right now.  it's one thing at home I understand you hate dishes but to constantly force the same chores on me here just because I do it at home doesn't mean I also want to be tied to the sink at your mothers too that isn't fair to me or either of you parent's and shows how backwards you are in your thinking despite being so outspoken about equality for all genders.\n\n I may as well just stay home on my own and completely relax the next time there's a family gathering as it isn't relaxing  or a break for me, mom or bio mom. We'd like a day where we're able to have fun like you all so and we can't because somehow it's expected that 3 women have to do everything because we are the home maker types. I think the only time I didn't get the silent help mom look, head nudge was when I was sick with a bad chest infection and once when I threw my back out I could barely walk without jumping in pain that even his father who was alive at the time told me to go sit down.\n\nAdmittedly he now does help but  I've told his mother and his bio mother you do realize it's been us 3 for years doing this parhaps it's time to stop hosting the gatherings and put the onus on the adult kids so parhaps they will realise the amount of work it takes and we can sit and relax for a change without helping like they do. his bio mom said she was on board and would happily just order take out for gathering in the future so we don't have to work our butts off. \n\n My daughter managed to host once and never did it again she admitted it was insanity the amount of work required and started to help at her gt grandmothers without complaints since though she tries to slip back into old habits her grandmother has said I'm almost 80 I'm not able to do this like I could 10-15 years ago so I need all the help I can get,. My son tried 3 times and didn't make it past anyone showing up everyone came 4-5 hours apart and left because they hadn't even prepared food, refused to start cooking saying more people were showing up I think we waited 5 hours and said ok we have to go, you said x time we have a long drive home our car has no a/c we were trying to avoid the worst of the heat and have plans for the evening as yours was spur of the moment invite. We left with the words of can't you stay and help us prep/cook food or clean before girlfriends parents come. We both did the sorry we have other obligations  and promptly left exactly as he would do at his grandmother's. He started to help a bit more there roo during family gatherings after realizing just what it entails but then started to refuse again. \n\nSometimes it takes someone changing the routine or finally saying hey nope this isn't right or for them to be treated in a similar fashion to how they acted  when they finally hosted  their own partiss.", "NTA - This is not the family for you.

At my parents I would spends hours cooking and then cleaning. My husband would help some with the cleaning but so did my brother. I was done with it when my husband\u2019s mother and sister started expecting me to all of the cleanup while they sat with the men. Privately I told my husband (at that time he was my boyfriend) that I would do all the work at my parents home and he could do all the work at his mother\u2019s. He did agree but his mother and sister tried to make me do all the work while refusing to let my boyfriend assist. I was just a broken record, telling them. I assisted with preparing food for both families and I do the setup and cleanup at my parents house and my boyfriend will do the setup and cleanup at their house.", "NTA.

As my dad says \u201cif you can\u2019t change it, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I hope your holidays get better, if you have or want kids. Then you can start your own traditions. If you don\u2019t you can always take trips for the holidays. I sincerely hope you have great holidays for the future.", "I mean that's in the past, can't change it. You did become aware of the rule (let's call it \"expectation\" instead) at some point though, so you had/have the ability to make an informed decision on whether or not to attend their functions after that point.", "Maybe if the younger cousin ever becomes less scared of dogs, you can host your own family get-together - with the condition that *everyone* who comes must help clean up afterwards.  :-)", "40m married here, usually if we have a family get together everyone does something.  If it's Christmas it's either preparing giant amounts of horrible sprouts, or setting the table, cooking, serving drinks, carving the turkey, bringing plates out and loading the dishwasher, washing up, putting left overs away etc.  It's a group effort and things get done quicker so we can all sit down and nurse our bursting bellys.\n\nAll of the above is true with the exception of my FIL, cause he's a lazy fuck (that's unfair he is culturally used to my MIL doing everything for him, but the net result is he's a lazy fuck)\n\n(NTA)", "Yeah, the insults would bother me as well. I also don\u2019t understand how you can\u2019t get one of those women to agree with you!", "Great advice and so well written - thank you! I have considered myself very close with her but am questioning that relationship a bit.\n\nFor context she started spewing all of this out in a drunken rage and she has a tendency to personally attack whoever is in the vicinity when she's had too much to drink. It's not the first time I've been the target. \n\nI was pretty surprised by this though because we are usually on the same page in regards to beliefs and values and what not. I may try and revisit the conversation when she is sobered up and seems open to it. But she has had a tendency to disregard my opinion on family matters because I \"don't know what it's like to have a good family\" which is irritating to be dismissed with.", "Hahaha I love that \ud83d\ude05 and thank you, I appreciate that! I would love to have kids and create our own traditions, so hopefully that is in our future!", "Yes, we decided to swap back and forth between helping clean up stuff. So one of us is always helping. We did not think that was an issue.\n\nWe were not aware this WAS an issue until recently.", "I really hope so! She is absolutely terrified though. They actually have a dog now too and she avoids him. It makes me so sad.", "I love this (minus the FIL part) - a group effort would be ideal! Has it always been that way even when you were dating?", "I've never directly had a conversation about it with any of them because I just didn't know it was an issue! I've only heard it from his sister and was really shocked she was so adamant in her position as we are usually on the same page with stuff. \n\nI think we are going to try my boyfriend asking a few of the guys to help next time. I want to try and avoid just bringing this up in a group setting and confronting everyone. I also don't want to fully assume that she was being entirely truthful as she said it in a fit of anger so I'm not really sure how honest it was.", "Wait - you were refused the opportunity to host because you have dogs, and meanwhile her OWN FAMILY got a dog?  WTF?  That doesn't even make any sense.  Poor kid.", "Pretty much, it's just a thing.  I always offer to help.\n\nI think it's cause my Mum never took any shit, she's always been \"I'm happy to do the cooking but you get to clear up and do all the other bits.\"\n\nGuess it's just instilled a sense of helping on those sorts of big occasions.\n\nMy wife grew up in the UK, but her parents are from India originally so I think there is a bit of a left over cultural aspect that the man sits and does f all, and my MIL totally validates and enables it.  Most recent example is we had a Diwali party for larks.  Lots of sitting around on sofas and eating food.  He literally got MIL to go get him food from the buffet table then when he'd finished eating, without saying anything just hands his plate back my MIL (which she took instead of telling him to put it down himself somewhere) and sits back.  It's so weird.  No please or thank yous just an expectation.", "I would keep bringing up the men not helping part. If they say everyone has to help then ask why the men don\u2019t and haven\u2019t helped EVER. If they bring up how it\u2019s o my every few weeks then ask about men being able to help since it\u2019s only happening once in a while.\n\nHave them answer and think about the double standard. If they outright say women have to serve and men get to relax then it\u2019s also easier to outright say you don\u2019t support that and won\u2019t be part of sexist traditions.", "We have very yappy dogs! They get excited when people come over and bark. They settle down after a few minutes but it is loud for a hot second lol so I won't pretend like our dogs are angels. We have friends over a bunch and it's never an issue but with some older relatives and a kid that's scared of dogs, I completely understand not getting to host. It sucks but it's fair.\n\nWe have offered to put them outside or downstairs so they are not directly around everyone but we are not comfortable boarding them and removing them from the house. It would also be pretty expensive. And there is again definitely some \"ownership\" over certain holidays and who hosts them anyways.\n\nBut yeah, they got a tiny dog that is pretty mild mannered. I think they were hoping it would be a positive experience for her to maybe like dogs more but she is still scared and gets freaked out. ):", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt is sexist. Something being a tradition does not negate and can in fact sometimes be an indicator, of something being sexist and discriminatory.", "INFO:  how many times are we going to have to have a version of this topic?", "All the men are just lazy and showing up for a free meal lol. NTA", "NTA stop attending his family functions. You aren't a maid for lazy men", "Totally NTA, completely unfair and infuriating \n\nA group of us (all couples) used to go away for weekend trips and it was always the women prepping, planning, bringing the food and clearing up. One year we all agreed we just wouldn\u2019t clear up after dinner just to see what happened. We all sat around the table with dirty dishes for 2 hours until I think the men twigged we weren\u2019t shifting and they half kicked themselves into gear and started moving dishes. \n\nI\u2019ve also been known to call out people not pulling their weight (regardless of gender). I\u2019ll throw a tea towel at them and say \u2018hey, you\u2019re up, time to do the dishes\u2019 and they have no argument except to gawp and have to assist", "So you and your boyfriend now take turns with the clean up. Sounds like a reasonable outcome. Why worry about what the other relatives have to say as long as you and bf are on the same page?", "NTA for standing up to misogynistic practices! Tell them you are more than happy to help if the men help too-but that you\u2019ll skip all together if they are just gonna gossip like a sewing circle about you.", "NTA\n\nAs far back as the 1960's my family have had the tradition at the huge Christmas get together that the men do all the washing up and clearing up after the meal. This is non negotiable as the women do the cooking and serving of the meal. It's never been a problem and has always been taken with good cheer.", "Nta. But just stop going. They'll never stop", "NTA - if you are a guest, then you should be treated as a guest.\n\nIf they consider you a 'member of the family' then your opinions should count.  Sit down and watch whatever the men are watching.  His sister sounds nasty.\n\nPerhaps they want to spend time 'bonding' with you in the kitchen, talking about hair / nails/ makeup / babies and they are offended that you choose not to join them, that you consider yourself management material.  You are questioning the order of things and perhaps they look a little foolish in the kitchen while everybody else is enjoying the day.\n\nI grew up in a family where we tried to make the men do their fair share but its hard work.  So many dodges.", "Nta. My family on my father's side is like that. I refused for years to partake. Currently my partner's family is traditional, however everyone always does something like cooking, cleaning, gardening etc. \n\nYour bf can go alone", "Lol NTA. Tell the sister that the gatherings are only every once in a while and she can get over you not helping", "This is my exact family growing up, I refuse to partake in anything unless me and my brother partake equally, and now as an adult, im so glad I set that standard as a child. I am willing to help, but not because I am a girl. If anything my brother is better in the kitchen and I am better help in the garage", "NTA", "NTA. Tell her it's not your fault your father and brothers are to incompetent to help clean up.", "NTA I hate that women are downgraded to just servers and cleaners.", "NTA.\n\nYour BF obviously wants to go, and that's completely fine!\n\nBut when it's only the women that are cleaning the dishes, and the men just goof around, drink and watch TV? That's just ridiculous.\n\nIf you dont want to attend, that's honestly fine and the others should understand that the men don't even help during cleaning, and stop being blind and thinking you're there for the meals.\n\nExplain to them how you feel if they're not ignoring you that much.\n\nI completely understand how you feel, and the others should too.", "NTA you are entitled to your feelings. But with that comes the realization that it goes both ways. Just as you have your own feelings, this family does as well. It doesn't make either party right or wrong, just different. \n This is the way they do things. Having a one person come into the picture complaining and/or expecting change is going to cause a strain. They don't have to  change how they do things and it's unlikely they will. So you must decide how important this is to you \nIs it important enough to stay away from these gatherings, thus alienating your boyfriend? Because that will happen.\nIf it is that important, go ahead and end the relationship. Save yourself and the bf the conflict that will inevitably happen.\nIf it is not that important deal breaker, I'd suggest looking at it from a different perspective... In that family perhaps the men have other roles, duties that they fulfill. Perhaps the women simply do not want them in their kitchen. Like how is all the adults going to fit in the kitchen to do clean up realistically.\nIt's for you to decide in the grand scheme of things if this is a hill you're willing to die on. Good Luck", "NTA. My family is like this too and it\u2019s fucked up. I really like how you and your boyfriend alternate turns. Odd they are complaining when it\u2019s still the same amount of help bc if you aren\u2019t doing it your bf is.", "I agree with this. My exhusbands family was like this, OP. I ended up cooking the lions share of everything after his mom got sick and doing all the dishes/cleaning up after 8 people while the guys all just laid around watching tv. It causes a lot of resentment. I was working 60-70 hours a week (2-3 jobs at one point) to put my ex through school. AND was still expected to teach his younger brother (homeschooled) and help him with his work. I was a glorified mommy and it didn't go over well in the end. \n\nYou are NTA for not embracing misogynistic conduct. It's good that your boyfriend has your back on this. My husband now would never let something like that go unchecked.", "Great way to end the relationship. Dealing with conflict is an important part of a relationship.", "Especially because they\u2019re talking crap.", "This ain\u2019t a culture, it's blatant sexism", "Also if you want to have kids with him and don\u2019t want this modeled to them draw your line in the sand now.", "No one forced you to do that.", "It simply just don\u2019t make sense. I just can\u2019t see the logic from these people", "She needs to get over the fact that you're not going to play their game.", "Man... It sounds like such a waste of water to rinse first. No wonder why they need so much help. Scraping whatever is on the plate off first before sticking it into the dishwasher is just so much easier. Which is something each person should do for their own plate.\n\nIf people want food to go then they should also pack their own.\n\nMy judgement is a NTA.", "Honestly, I want to say that she's just jealous that your husband alternates and helps with cleaning duties and hers just sits and watched TV every single time. She's probably annoyed that she has to clean every time, but it's misplaced anger. Instead of talking to you she should talk to her husband.", "I would argue that you're wrong, actually. His mother, grandmother, and the males in his family put a lot of that pressure on me \"if I wanted to be with him.\" I felt forced if nothing else. It breeds a lot of resentment, I can promise you that.", "If they are that traditional (misogynistic) the men would have paid for it as breadwinners", "She said in the post her bf and her switch out the workload each visit. That's why this was even brought up. The two a team and the others are butter they didn't think of it or bitter their husband's wouldn't go for it. Either way, the apple traveled farther with that one.", "She\u2026 does not sound that pleasant \ud83e\udd74 \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been repeatedly dismissed by her in such a cruel way"]}
