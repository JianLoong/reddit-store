Your boyfriend is in charge of shutting down any complaint or criticism of you by his family. You get to show up, do your share of the work when it's your turn, and sit back and let your boyfriend do his share of the work when it's hist turn.

This way you can get your position out on the table, simply and respectfully, and listen respectfully when they rebut. \n\nMaybe a new tradition can be born: along with food, drink and ingredient assignments,  jobs can be assigned.

Most of my family was male, so my mom, aunt and grandma would cook the food, the males would eat and either watch sports or fall asleep. After the meal, me and my other female cousin was expected to do the clean up, so it would be two preteen girls washing all the dishes, making sure not to damage the china or silverware, it was ridiculous .  I finally told my mother that it wasn't fair because we were the only ones doing it.  She said that was the way they were raised but she agreed and made my brother help.

You've got FIVE women helping clean up, I'm sure it doesn't take you forever, use that as a time to bond with them, have a chat, have a laugh then go about your life.
