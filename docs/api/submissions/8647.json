After the meal, me and my other female cousin was expected to do the clean up, so it would be two preteen girls washing all the dishes, making sure not to damage the china or silverware, it was ridiculous .  I finally told my mother that it wasn't fair because we were the only ones doing it.  She said that was the way they were raised but she agreed and made my brother help.

They\u2019re not going to change. I don\u2019t think this is a major thing they are asking. Even if it\u2019s 6-8x yearly, if it\u2019s his family, I would put up with it. Maybe next time you can suggest you all have one dinner where it\u2019s \u201cladies night\u201d and the men have to provide the food and dinner and clean up. But I would only suggest this once you are on good terms with them. \n\nI think if this is an important relationship for you, I would let this one go.

I am more than happy to help - but not when it's only the women?! \n\nThat's interesting that you heard this from your BIL's wife too.  I don't really understand all the family gossip stuff. Just tell me directly if there is an issue so I can address it... not hear it through the family grapevine. Ugh."]}
