And for wanting an apology?", "selftext": "I've just proposed to my girlfriend of one year (Megan). She had a dust up with my sister (Roseanne) and when I defended her my sister went off on me too and told me off.\n\nMegan is really into skincare. She posts on all the skincare subreddits and other internet forums. I can't even count the amount of skincare stuff she has but she looks great so she's doing something right. She has a morning routine and a bedtime routine. She says they aren't complicated to me but I'm a guy. My skincare is washing my face in the shower and also before bed if I remember. I can't follow what Megan does but it makes her happy so I support it.\n\nMegan has tried to bond with Roseanne over skincare but it's not working. According to Megan (and Roseanne) Roseanne's skincare is: Lots of 1] sleep 2] water 3] sunscreen and no 1] smoking 2] tanning 3] makeup (ever). Megan was a bit shocked when Roseanne said that. She says thats no routine at all. The no makeup, even at her wedding also threw Megan for a loop but it's more about the skin for her. I honestly never thought about it before I met Megan. For Roseanne's birthday Megan and me gave her a gift card to a store called Sephora because they have a bunch of skincare stuff. We just found out it's still unused almost a year later. Twice Megan has left or dropped off a bag or basket of skincare products with a list of steps and they are just gathering dust in Roseanne's bathroom. When Megan saw the first bag unused when we were visiting Roseanne she tried again and left some stuff for Roseanne. This led to Roseanne telling Megan to \"shut up\" about skincare and telling her off. I defended Megan because she was just trying to do something nice and Roseanne was an ass to her. Roseanne told me off too.\n\nMegan said the first couple of times she met Roseanne, she listened when Megan talked about skincare. Roseanne also bought Megan some of her favourite stuff after stalking her social media. Roseanne doesn't even have social media. Megan was trying to do something nice for Roseanne. Roseanne said Megan can't take a hint. Roseanne was also mad because Megan didn't talk to my dad, my brother, brother-in-law or either of my grandfathers about skincare, just her, the only woman in my family. But they're like me and Megan knows that.\n\nRoseanne won't even talk to Megan now. She told me off too and Megan was just trying to do something nice. Roseanne is 38 and Megan says women can't afford to be lax about skincare as they get older. This applies to Megan too which is why she takes such good care of her skin. I want Roseanne to apologise for telling Megan off but she says I'm dreaming and my dad and brother are trying to get me to forget it.\n\nI'm 35, Megan is 34 and Rose is 38 if it makes any difference", "created_utc": 1686514747, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14745mk/aita_for_defending_my_fianc\u00e9e_after_my_sister/", "score": 225, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your fianc\u00e9e has told your sister that \u201cshe can\u2019t afford to be lax about her skincare as she\u2019s getting older\u201d and you think your sister owes her an apology?  Your sister is 38, not 16.  She is quite capable of managing her own life \ud83d\ude00(and skincare).  It sounds like your fianc\u00e9e has only one interest and that is skincare.  Maybe try bonding on something that your sister is interested in.  Oh, and if she tried that with my wife or daughter, the products and gift card would be used on your fianc\u00e9e in a place where the sun doesn\u2019t shine", "YTA, both of you.\n\nLook, your sister is not into makeup. Why do you even bother gifting her a Sephora card? What the hell do you want her to do with it? Buy makeup she will never use? You wasted your money. It's not being nice, it's just not taking a freakin hint and not respecting boundaries too.\n\nIf your girlfriend really want to bond with your sister, she could, oh I don't know, be interested in what she likes rather than forcing her to change. No wonder she told you two off, I would have done the same. If I'm the only woman in your family and I'm the only one harassed by your freakin girlfriend I would have tell her to stop being so sexist and leave me the heck alone. I don't like makeup. Keep your shit, keep your useless Sephora card. If you want to be nice to me, gift me a book, or even better, gift me a card to buy books because I read so much that there is a good chance that you will offer me something that I have already read.\n\nLeave her alone, apologize, and for God's sake, stop buying her useless makeup.", "YTA. She's not interested in your fianc\u00e9e's hobby. Megan sounds utterly insufferable and needs to leave her alone.", "Rose is right, Megan *can't* take a hint.\n\nMegan likes all her skincare stuff. Cool. She can enjoy it.\n\nThat doesn't mean she needs to try and *push* that on Rose. Fine to discuss it to start with and see if there's interest, but it's very clear that there isn't.\n\nDifferent people enjoy different things. Understand that your sister does not want to spend of time and money doing all the things your fianc\u00e9e does. She was polite in trying to cater to Megan's interests in getting her skincare related gifts, but how tone deaf can you and your fianc\u00e9e be in return? You sound utterly wearing.\n\nYTA, along with Megan, for not taking a hint.", "YTA. Your fiancee is concerned about her looks and aging process. And she can't understand how any woman isn't. So rather than trying to be friendly with your sister and bond over mutual interests, she tries to force her into the same feminine mould she has.\n\nYour sister, like you, eats healthily, protects her skin, sleeps well and is sensible. She doesn't need to smother it in lotions to fight off aging. And your fiancee seems to think that is a either a reflection on her or not what a proper woman should do. So she is forcing Roseann to confirm by stalking her social media, belabouring her with it every time they meet and buying her unwanted stuff. A present is only a gift if it is something the recipient wants and not an ego boost for the giver. Megan is giving your sister things she has unilaterally decided she needs not anything your sister actually wants or will use.\n\nSympathies to Roseanne. Must be hard to engage with someone who has decided your view are worthless because you don't follow a skin routine.", "Lol dude there is no way in hades you are this daft. Your fiancee is rude as can be at worst or as clueless as they come at best. How your sister manages her skin is her business and hers alone. Megan should have taken the hint when she noticed the initial gift went unused but nope she doubled down and brought another unwanted gift for your sister then topped it off with a gift card to Sephora. Are you serious right now? Megan owes Rose a huge apology. She needs to get over herself and accept that not all women have an hours long process to keep their skin how they like it. And here's a hint, your sisters regimen is very good. The only thing I would add is a good moisturizer and she may already have that. YTA, Megan's an AH and you both owe Rose an apology.", "YTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is pushy and has no sense of boundaries and needed to be told off. Roseanne has made it very clear that she is not interested in these skincare products and Megan keeps pushing them on her. It\u2019s rude and honestly insulting when it comes along with this \u2018women can\u2019t afford to be lax about skincare as they get older\u2019 crap. And she\u2019s correct that it feels sexist when she keeps trying to bond with her over it even though she has zero interest.\n\nMegan owes your sister an apology and changed behavior. And you need to see clearly the type of person you\u2019re engaged to.", "YTA. Super easy. Roseanne was super polite about Megan trying to make her take an interest in skincare. She bought Megan skincare gifts. She's communicated how she prefers to maintain her skin. You bought her gifts of skincare products multiple times despite her making her lack of interest clear. When you see she wasn't using your skincare gifts, you felt the need to buy her more instead of backing off and accepting her choice. As Roseanne pointed out, it is sexist of you and Megan to expect her to be into skincare and not bother the men with it. If that's all you talked to her about for a year, it's no surprise she told you to shut up and cut off contact. You and Megan should apologize. \n\nHow would you feel if Roseanne decided you needed to be interested in some sport or activity that you don't like and wouldn't talk to you about anything else for over a year and kept giving you gifts related to that activity that you had no use for?", "YTA\n\nYour sister is right. Megan is not listening. Megan loves skincare. Great, doesn't mean Roseanne has to as well. \n\nYour fiance should apologize for being so pushy. The world doesn't revolve around what Megan wants in everyone's skincare.", "You don't give \"self-improvement\" gifts unless the person recieving it has made it abundantly clear they actually want it. This includes giving out skincare products, makeup/hair products, anything related to weightloss, and self-help books. When you give these kinds of things without explicitly knowing they will be wanted and welcomed, you're sending a message that says \"you're not good enough, but I can fix you!\" and it's incredibly rude.\n\nMegan owes Roseanne the apology. YTA.", "Yta and so is Megan. Imagine itf Megan were constantly trying to change YOUR skincare routine instead of just letting you be \"uggh im a guy and guys get to be gross\". You would find it infantiziling and harassing to. You need to get your head of your butt before Rose stops talking to you AT ALL.", "I honestly thought the ages were going to be about 15. YTA. Megan is hugely TA. And Roseanne is definitely not the one who should be apologizing.", "YTA and so is Megan.  I am older than both Megan and Roseanne and have a similar skincare to Roseanne, no cleansers or toners, just warm water and moisturizer, very little make up due to having sensitive skin.  I often get compliments about how young my skin looks and am often mistaken for someone younger.  I know of others who use a lot of products and their skin is shocking.  Roseanne has told Megan what she does and Megan is an AH for trying to push her beliefs onto Roseanne.", "\"Megan is trying to bond over skin care.\" \n\nWell, sister doesn't care about skin care. You can't bond with someone over something they have no interest in.\n\n2. Megan is badgering your sister about skin care when your suster is honestly just tired of hearing about it. \n\n3. Both of you know sister doesn't care about skincare, and yet megan insists on buying sister skin care, then has the self-entitled audacity to be upset that sister isn't using skin care. \n\nSister is fed up. And Megan is beating a dead horse and being annoying, irritating. And honestly.... a jerk. \n\nIt's Megan who owes your sister an appology. Not the other way around. Megan couldn't take a hint. The only way she was going to actually listen was if sister snapped at her. If Megan had respected your sister, this wouldn't have happened", "YTA. It sounds like Roseanne has the same skin care routine as you, your Dad and all the other people in your family. So why is Megan pushing Roseanne to try these things and no one else? It sounds like Roseanne has tried being polite. She accepted the gifts without complaint. But that doesn't mean she has to use them. Megan is an AH for continuing to try to push Roseanne to use these expensive products.  I have no doubt Megan meant well, but she needs to accept that not everyone wants to focus on skin care as much as she does.\n\n\nAs for all those skin care products and gift certificates, I'd see about donating them to a domestic abuse or homeless shelter.", "YTA and so is Megan. It sounds like skincare is an obsession not a hobby and she pushes it on everyone else. She sounds exhausting and your sister has nothing to apologise for", "Your sister is right. Megan is an asshole. She's told her she's not interested in obsessing over her skincare routine. You and she buy her a gift that Megan would love, give her things that Megan loves, none of the  gifts involve anything your sister enjoys.\n\nYour sister's skincare routine is the same as yours.\n\nI want to go N T A, because you usually should support your fianc\u00e9e/wife/GF. But, this is an exception YTA.\n\nYour sister wants to not discuss her skincare routine and neither of you can respect that.", "Yta your fiance sounds egregiously annoying to be around", "Since you clearly can\u2019t take a hint, let me try to put this into an analogy you\u2019ll get.\n\nImagine your sister has a BF who\u2019s REALLY into bodybuilding. And you\u2019re not. Maybe you mildly like exercise or something but really just don\u2019t enjoy it on the whole. He talks to you about it and you listen (because that\u2019s polite). You express how you\u2019re not really into all of that.\n\nBut the more you see him, the more he pushes supplements, regimens, buys you a membership to his bodybuilding gym. He won\u2019t STOP talking to you (and only you) about this. Would you not be at the very LEAST annoyed that after you told him no, that you\u2019re not interested, he keeps poking and pushing you anyways? \n\nIt might even be insulting, like he thinks you NEED to go to the gym or something. Like he thinks you\u2019re lacking, which is hurtful (if possibly unintentional, nonetheless). \n\nIt also makes him look like he isn\u2019t a good listener if he can\u2019t take a hint, and like he has nothing else to offer than the fact that he likes bodybuilding if he can\u2019t find a single other thing for you two to talk about or bond over (since he keeps circling back to it). \n\nP.s. please don\u2019t weasel your way into the smallest facets of peoples arguments against you to argue rather than addressing the larger point. It makes you look like a bad listener like your GF.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry but your girlfriend sounds insufferable. I have a skincare routine but you know who knows about it- nobody, because unless someone asks me about it I don\u2019t mention it- because it\u2019s boring.

HOW exactly is Megan trying to do something nice?   \n\nShe\u2019s pushing what she\u2019s interested in (obsessed maybe)  onto someone else, who has tried to begin with polite interest at first, then explicitly had to resort to saying she\u2019s not interested, but yet, Megan pushes and also gets upset her pushed unsolicited products aren\u2019t used, so she NATURALLY GIVES HER MORE.

So is your gf\n\nAside from all the badgering and sexist notions of women having to look after their skin while men can be respected in not caring about it\u2026here are some basics about skincare that you and your GF should be made aware of. \n\n1. Sleep - this is when our bodies repair themselves and produce collagen - which prevents sagging skins and improves its look. \n\n2. Water is key in maintaining good skin, hydration will improve the quality of your skin from the inside out.\n\n2. Sunscreen - above all, is the best thing for your skin AND aging skin. The damage that sun does is the leading reason that skin ages including sun spots and wrinkles. \n\n3. No tanning and smoking - will protect your skin massively from UV rays and the toxins in cigarettes. Tanning is leading cause in skin cancer. \n\n4. No makeup - personal choice but it completely mitigates the risk of leaving product behind on your skin - which would be bad for it. \n\nYour sister is actually doing great by her skin. Your gf\u2019s lotions and potions may not actually do much in the long run. But sleep, water and sunscreen will! Get off your sister\u2019s back and educate yourself about skin if it means so much to you (you\u2019ll see how right your sister is). Megan should apologise for not respecting boundaries.

Anyone else notice OPs one reply was also just deflection from the facts.\n\nYTA OP", "Omg YTA and so is your fiance. Is she involved in a skin care MLM? Because it sounds like it.

She wants to be left alone and do her own thing. \n\nYou both need to shut up and mind your own business.", "Have you heard of benevolent sexism?  Here is a definition I found:\n\n\"Benevolent sexism refers to attitudes about women that seem positive in tone (eg, women should be cherished) but nonetheless connote inferiority to men based on fragility, lack of competence, or need of help and protection (Glick & Fiske, 1996).\"\n\nA common form of benevolent sexism is praising a woman for being beautiful/prioritising it over her other attributes and/or 'helping' the woman to become (what is perceived as) her truly feminine, beautiful self. \n\nMegan is trying to \"help\" rosanne by giving her skin care products and encouraging her to use them because she \"needs\" to look youthful *as a woman*. She doesn't talk to your brother and father because they are \"like you\" (men). In megans eyes, they aren't required to be pretty and youthful because they are men, but rosanne is missing out on the crucial knowledge that all women need: how to be- and remain-pretty (for men). \n\nMy mother in law used to do this and it felt awful. It felt like she only cared about my outward appearance and that she saw all my worth as exclusive to my looks. It didn't matter what other interests or skills I had, she ignored that in favour of giving me helpful advice on how to wear my hair or do my makeup or care for my skin. It *severely* damaged my relationship with her and it sounds like this exact same this is happening between Megan and rosanne. \n\nYTA and so is Megan.\n\n 1) Megan is a grown adult and should be able to communicate with others based on *mutual* interests.\n\n2) rosanne is also a grown adult and does not require unsolicited and blatantly unwanted 'help'. She has explicitly said this, you clearly understand she doesn't want this, and yet you do not respect that. \n\n3) You are reinforcing the gender stereotypes that skin care and beauty are women's things that \"men just don't get\". That's just plain wrong. Men are not stupid enough to be incapable of understanding health just because they are men. You're just being deliberately obtuse because you're not interested.  You are perfectly capable of recognising that you don't harass people about having different interests and priorities.  Looking after your skin isn't secret women's business, but the fact you are making these separations in your mind reinforces the idea that Megan is allowed to be disrespectful to rosanne because it's a women's thing that men are too dumb to understand.  Don't stoop to the level of being proud of incompetence. \n\n4) just because somebody intends to be helpful doesn't mean it is actually helpful. Megan is not being helpful and it's gotten to the point that it is now damaging. Imagine if somebody was consistantly buying you weights or gym memberships and constantly asking why you weren't using them because \"it's important for men to look buff\". It would likely make you feel really invalid and unappreciated. Would it make it better if they said \"oh, but I'm just helping\"? No. \n\n\nInstead, you should apologise to rosanne and say that you've done messed up. She has every right to feel angry about being pressured to be beautiful. \n\nTalk to Megan and say you don't support her pressuring rosanne to use her beauty products. She doesn't want them and she doesn't need them and that's okay. If she does say things about how rosanne is a woman and needs to think of her skin, you can simply say \"no she doesn't. She is an adult who can make her own choices. Skin care is your interest, not hers.\" Whenever the gender thing pops up, iterate that said person is an *adult* and can make their own choices. This goes for anything, including the notion that men \"dont get things\". No, they are adults who can make their own choices. \n\nYou can break down the stereotypes you've enforced, but you need to recognise that you're perpetuating them, too.", "Megan is TA here but you\u2019re also in the suck bucket. \n\nYou both need to apologize to your sister, Megan for her frankly CREEPY behavior trying to repeatedly force your sister into a skincare system that she has made it clear she does not want, and does not affect Megan in any way, and you for not telling your fianc\u00e9 to back off in the first place. \n\n\u201cMegan says it\u2019s important\u201d Megan needs to learn boundaries.", "YTA", "YTA.

She had a dust up with my sister (Roseanne) and when I defended her my sister went off on me too and told me off.\n\nMegan is really into skincare. She posts on all the skincare subreddits and other internet forums. I can't even count the amount of skincare stuff she has but she looks great so she's doing something right. She has a morning routine and a bedtime routine. She says they aren't complicated to me but I'm a guy. My skincare is washing my face in the shower and also before bed if I remember. I can't follow what Megan does but it makes her happy so I support it.\n\nMegan has tried to bond with Roseanne over skincare but it's not working. According to Megan (and Roseanne) Roseanne's skincare is: Lots of 1] sleep 2] water 3] sunscreen and no 1] smoking 2] tanning 3] makeup (ever). Megan was a bit shocked when Roseanne said that. She says thats no routine at all. The no makeup, even at her wedding also threw Megan for a loop but it's more about the skin for her. I honestly never thought about it before I met Megan. For Roseanne's birthday Megan and me gave her a gift card to a store called Sephora because they have a bunch of skincare stuff. We just found out it's still unused almost a year later. Twice Megan has left or dropped off a bag or basket of skincare products with a list of steps and they are just gathering dust in Roseanne's bathroom. When Megan saw the first bag unused when we were visiting Roseanne she tried again and left some stuff for Roseanne. This led to Roseanne telling Megan to \"shut up\" about skincare and telling her off. I defended Megan because she was just trying to do something nice and Roseanne was an ass to her. Roseanne told me off too.\n\nMegan said the first couple of times she met Roseanne, she listened when Megan talked about skincare. Roseanne also bought Megan some of her favourite stuff after stalking her social media. Roseanne doesn't even have social media. Megan was trying to do something nice for Roseanne. Roseanne said Megan can't take a hint. Roseanne was also mad because Megan didn't talk to my dad, my brother, brother-in-law or either of my grandfathers about skincare, just her, the only woman in my family. But they're like me and Megan knows that.\n\nRoseanne won't even talk to Megan now. She told me off too and Megan was just trying to do something nice. Roseanne is 38 and Megan says women can't afford to be lax about skincare as they get older. This applies to Megan too which is why she takes such good care of her skin. I want Roseanne to apologise for telling Megan off but she says I'm dreaming and my dad and brother are trying to get me to forget it.\n\nI'm 35, Megan is 34 and Rose is 38 if it makes any difference\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Take a step back and accept that you and your gf AHs.", "Sephora is a well known makeup store, stop being obtuse. Your sister has clearly stated she is not interested in implementing a skincare routine in line with what your girlfriend does and your girlfriend can\u2019t take a hint. Why is buying your sister a gift card to a store she would never buy anything from a gift?? It\u2019s rude and thoughtless.", "The issue here isn\u2019t whether it\u2019s skincare or makeup. The issue is your fianc\u00e9e is badgering your sister with her ideas about how your sister should perform her personal grooming long after your sister has let her know that she\u2019s not interested.", "OP, you're missing the point. The point is it is a major asshole move of your fiance to continually try to force something on someone who doesn't want it. Your sister did the polite thing by not making a fuss, but she was under no obligation to use the skin care products your fiance gave her or take your fiance's advice. Your fiance giving her the gift once and giving her the advice once could be taken as \"trying to do a nice thing\". But it crosses into asshole territory when she is now repeatedly attempting to force her skincare obsession onto your sister who has no interest. She's not doing it to the men in your family because \"she knows they're like me\". Well, your sister has made it clear she is like that as well, so why won't your fiance lay off her? So, your fiance is the asshole for continuing to harass your sister about skincare, and YTA for excusing her behavior.", "Dude. I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019re not a troll, in spite of your responses to ONLY those comments where you can plausibly deny. I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019re doubling down on this, because no one wants to feel like an asshole. Everyone is occasionally an asshole. It\u2019s okay, it happens.  Apologies really aren\u2019t that hard, when they\u2019re sincere. The intentions might not have been meant to be seen the way they were, but now you know better. So do better.", "Okay, fine, your sister is NOT into SKINCARE to the level that your fiancee wants her to be.", "Sephora is basically a make up store\u2026.. it may have some other products but most people know it for makeup.", "Oh before long sh will be sliding in to former classmates and coworkers DMs with a \u201c hey hun\u201d forty emoji and a shill for monat or some other mlm", "Yes! My husband got into straight edge razors last year and part of that is a tone of skincare before and after. He\u2019s so happy he\u2019s finally taking care of his skin.", "Apologies. I got that the wrong way round. Rosanne tried to get Megan a gift she wanted by looking at her social media and listening to her interests. Pity your fiancee can't do the same by asking her what she wants and not shoe-horning her into what she thinks your sister should want.\n\nEdit: also don't you have some idea what your sister likes rather than buying her useless presents.", "So you ignored replying to the rest of the post? Is that because you realize what the commenter (and so many others) are saying is 100% correct?\n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9e owe your sister an apology, and your fianc\u00e9e needs to back the hell down with being so pushy on the skincare products and routines. If she wants to be friends with your sister, it needs to be a mutual meeting of minds, she needs to find common interests, not push her pet topic onto your sister.", "How can you and your superficial fiance honestly think you're the victims in this?", "Wow OP, I've never seen someone sooooo committed to missing the point. And because I fully expect you to \"not understand,\" I'll explain that what I mean is that people have taken the time to explain to you why you are such a raging AH complete with explanations. Repeatedly, you ignore the substance of the comment to focus on some minor detail they got wrong.  \n\nYour girlfriend is a shallow AH and YTA, like a lot. You're the AH for how you (with Megan) treated your sister.  You're the AH for ignoring all of your sister's polite attempts to move beyond skincare (it's unreal that that is a sentence that needs to be said.) You're the AH for somehow reaching adulthood without developing any understanding of gift giving. You're especially the AH for expecting your sister to apologize after she couldn't take it anymore and finally lost her cool and demanded an end to the skincare harassment. Then, when people on here take the time to explain the problem to you, you double down on the AHery by ignoring, deflecting, and refusing to absorb anything of consequence.\n\nReevaluate and be better!", ">My sister says she doesn't need it.\n\nTHEN TELL YOUR GF TO LEAVE HER TF ALONE", "You are being extremely pedantic. It doesn\u2019t really matter what order the gifts were given in, when Megan saw they weren\u2019t being used, it was time to move on. \n\nFrankly Megan sounds exhausting. She goes on and on about skin care (does she have no other interests) and when your sister politely gifts her skincare, she acts like it\u2019s an opening to convert your sister to a skincare cult. \n\nReciprocating your sister\u2019s thoughtfulness would mean *listening* to her interests and gifting her something *she* wants. Not lecturing her about women aging.", "Wow. \nYour GF is treating skincare as-if it were a religion and she is thinks ahe will save souls by getting new recruits.\n\nYour sister isn't interested in your girlfriend's \"faith\" and it shouldn't be rammed down her throat. \n\nYour sister has put up w/ enough of your GF's proselytizing about her lord and savior Nighttime Moisturizer, the virgin saint Clairifying Toner and the purification properties of holy miceller water ritual.\n\nIt is a hoby, not a sacred right. Your sister doesn't need it, doesn't want it and was never even remotely interested in it, but she has turned you into a true believer - that your SISTER needs it - which BTW is 100% sexist. Men age too, you know, so where is your skin care ritual?\n\nWhat your GF is doing is pretty similar to working out. It is fine for her to be into it and to a certain extent, it is very healthy. However, it can also go to far and become an unhealthy obsession. In addition, it is rude to insist someone needs to have a workout routine when the don't need one and aren't interested and to buy them workout related gifts when they have made it clear they are not interested.\n\nFrankly, your GF sounds like she is too obsessed w/ this hobby. I would find out how much she spends in a month on skincare and make-up products. I'm pretty sure you are going to be shocked.", "Why are you guys so obsessed with what Roseanne is doing with her own skin? Why does what Megan want matter more than what Roseanne wants? You guys are being so patronising.  Not to mention that Megan is clearly exhibiting controlling behaviour.  Over, of all things, skincare (and I say this as somebody who is very into skincare - I just know to limit it to my own skin, because everybody is an adult and can figure out what is best for them).", "> There's no mention of moisturizer because she doesn't have one and isn't interested\n\nSo why keep buying her that crap and forcing her to listen to Megan drone on about something she has no interest in?\n\nSounds a lot like Megan is using skincare as a replacement for a personality if thats all she does online and in conversation.\n\nOf course YTA", "And that's all that matters.  Your sister doesn't.  Your fiancee needs to stop trying to cram this down her throat.", "When you guys realized the \"gifts\" Megan gave were unwanted and gathering dust the first time any normal person would've back off...instead your gf kept pushing for some reason??? Your sister was listening and being nice to your gf about her interest to welcome her as a peer and friend, she has repeatedly shown she does not give a single solitary shit about skincare beyond that it matters to Megan! And that's sweet and nice of her! She doesn't care about any of this and considers it all junk and still tried to indulge your gf and all Megan did was just lean in harder and start it on the weird insane misogyny and ageism. Why can't you both take a hint?!", "Keep ignoring the important parts of the feedback you're getting **from posting on a public forum asking if you and your girlfriend were in the wrong**, that's definitely helpful.", "Okay so your fianc\u00e9 should learn to respect what she wants to do and not force your sister to use products she doesn\u2019t want to use.", "So you're saying your fiancee should be harassing you and all the men in your family about their \"skincare routines\" instead of your sister?", "I'm confused. Roseanne does way more than you, yet you listed 6 things that are her routine. Which of those 6 things do you and the men not do?\n\nHere's the thing, at no point in your post, do you mention that Roseanne has a skin care issue or that she's even asked for help with her skin care routine. Just because your girlfriend doesn't like Roseannes natural routine (that is clearly working), it does not give your girlfriend a free pass in pushing her expensive routine on your sister.\n\nYou really don't care to see that you or your girlfriend are wrong in the situation. Your sister accepted the first gift graciously. She never used it, and that should have been a hint. But your girlfriend being either slow or shallow, thought to keep pushing unwanted stuff, and then when not used, still not catching the drift, repeated the 2nd gift....your girlfriend and you are shallow and hold looks to an extremely high standard. Then, you both get extremely offended when someone finally speaks up after boundaries were constantly ignored. Grow up\n\nYTA", "Way more? She sleeps, drinks water and uses sunscreen, according to your post.", "Well REAL women have a skincare routine just like Megan\u2019s. Eye roll. She sounds ridiculous and boring. How about we talk about (and force on other people) our personal hygiene constantly?  YTA", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 yeeessss!!! Cant believe i forgot that!!!", "That\u2019s a fair point, I didn\u2019t really think about the timespan.", "The wheel is turning but the hamster is dead", "I bought you a gift card to little cesaers!....\"why I hate pizza\"...... it's not for pizza dummy... it's for the breadsticks sheesh some people are so dumb", "Because skin care", ">Which of those 6 things do you and the men not do?\n\nNone of us wear makeup.\n\nMy dad and both my grandfathers smoke.\n\nNone of us besides my brother-in-law wear sunscreen really. We don't purposely lie out just for tanning but we don't wear sunscreen. \n\nNone of us get enough sleep really. Or drink enough water.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Loooooool!!!!", "So it sounds like the men in the family should be getting the skin care routine from your girlfriend. It sounds like your sister has a pretty great natural routine that works well for her.\n\nYou and your girlfriend are shallow and refuse to respect boundaries. One day you may understand, that there are women out there that don't need to spend hundreds if not thousands on a skin care routine when whatever they're doing already works really darn well.", "So your sister is already doing more to care for her skin than men in your family, and yet it's only her that's being harassed about it?? How are you so disconnected from the truth??"]}
