Get out ASAP. That sounds awful. She could have warned you, but she probably knew you wouldn't come over.", "NTA. I'd leave right now if you got a place to go. That shits cringe as hell.", "Holy fuck. This is awkward as hell. You don't need to spend your Christmas hearing some guy your age banging your mother.\n\nWhat's up next? Him pulling the \"I'm your stepdad\"-card?\n\nDefinitely NTA. Get out, and spend the holidays with people who do value your presence over their sex life. Even if that means the KFC Christmas Special.", "NTA and I'd find somewhere else to stay. Even though mom will probably throw a fit over it and boy toy will think he's won. It is awful to be able to hear all of that and super cringe.", "NTA\n\nEw.", "NTA. Get out of there. Your mom and her boytoy are straight up trash.", "NTA, that sounds super uncomfortable. Go", "NTA. \nThe fact that he\u2019s younger than you is very uncomfortable. Regardless of his age the sexual comments and loud sex is inappropriate. How hard is it to have a little class.", "You aren't overreacting.  All you did was write a reddit post and shake while writing it.   You can tell them both that you can hear them, and don't appreciate their PDA; and ask them to resume their activities after you leave which is early in the morning. If they don't give you an appropriate response, that is up to you to escalate the situation a bit, and you still wouldn't be an AH imo.", "NTA.  I'm almost thinking \"Record it, and play it back to them when they're finished\", but that would mean enduring it twice.\n\nI'd exit to a hotel. If asked later, tell your Mom you didn't pay extra for the XXX rated show.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nThat's fucking innapropriate.", "NTA that sucks I\u2019m sorry", "NTA, leave. That\u2019s incredibly uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nIt's kinda weird she is dating someone so much younger but I am not judging.\n\nBut not showing some basic courtesy to not act like horny teenagers for a few days is pretty shit of them. Understandable it's making you uncomfortable.", "yeah no you\u2019re not even remotely TA for being creeped out by your mom dating someone younger than you and you are well within your right to wish not to bear auditory witness to their sex life", "I\u2019m with the eeewwweww also", "NTA , you should yell loud enough for the bf to hear, \u201c STOP FU@KING AROUND IN MY OLD WOMB!\u201d Hahaha", "NTA. Age aside I feel like when you have company you don\u2019t need to so loud \u201cduring\u201d. Haha be more considerate of your guests. But maybe I\u2019m a little prude there. \n\nI think that this was not the time to introduce the boyfriend to you. Now if you met them before that\u2019s one thing. But I see how you felt a bomb drop. Love is love but I feel like you woulda wanted a heads up of some sort even despite the age of they were close enough to spend holidays with each others families. \n\nAs for the overly PDA and sexual comments I would have said something. It\u2019s one thing to share a kiss and hold hands. But there is a time and place to be all up on each other and be nastay. Haha Ultimately you know your mom so you do you. But if possible maybe if you talk to your mom she would see your point and tell the boyfriend to calm down so you can all spend the holidays together. But no matter what you decide I think NTA. At least you did your best today to give it a chance. And you did your best not to make your mom feel uncomfortable about the age gap. It\u2019s just something you\u2019d probably feel uncomfortable with even if the guy wasn\u2019t younger than you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not wrong for wanting to leave.", "So your mom is having a loud sex with her boy toy, ummmm gross! Id personally would talk to my mom about it and interrupt this by knocking on their door asking her to please stop, that you\u2019re hearing everything and it\u2019s making you very uncomfortable. Remind her that you\u2019re only there visiting her for a short time and you\u2019d hate to cut that time even shorter because you don\u2019t want to hear or be around them having their \u201cSexy Fun Time\u201d , and if they have a problem with respecting your feelings, leave!

Ok, now that I have that over, I can understand how you might feel uncomfortable with this situation.

Love is love, age is just a number, and so on. But it was really a bomb drop. I can't control how I'm feeling, and his age is a big part of the problem.", "He\u2019s not shaming his mom for having a sex life- he just doesn\u2019t want it shoved in his face. A reasonable boundary every parent child relationship should have.", "Would YOU want to listen to your Mom getting banged by some dude young enough to be your younger brother?", "Yes, and I'm not saying anything about it.\n\nI'm the one unconfortable, so I'm the one leaving.\n\nI was asking if yall think I'm an asshole for leaving in the morning.

Can you and boy toy cut this shit out until I leave?", "Absolutely he is. Overly loud sex noises in this instance is to make a point to you that it is his place now and what he is doing.", "Yea. She is the adult in the situation. A simple \"tone it down a bit while my kid is here\" would be the logical thing to do.", "You\u2019re allowed to feel that way about his age. I would feel gross if my either of my parents were dating someone younger than me. (We are the same age). You are entitled to your feelings about who your parents are dating! I would leave tonight and not be there for Christmas. You are entitled to a nice and comfortable Christmas.", "No I get that. But what I\u2019m saying is by the sounds of it. The things they are doing that are making you uncomfortable it sounds like it\u2019s at a level to where even if the guy was \u201cage appropriate\u201d you still wouldn\u2019t want to be exposed to that. Like could you honestly say you wouldn\u2019t still be uncomfortable if you could here her having sec with someone who was older? Or hearing her boyfriend talk dirty to her in front of you like that? \n\nI understand age still IS a factor. And it\u2019s weirder that he\u2019s younger than you. But I was saying their behavior would be uncomfortable for you either way. Ya know? Like maybe you would be uncomfortable because of the age, but able to get passed it more for the holidays if they weren\u2019t being so\u2026 in your face with their more raunchy PDA.", "Please re-read my post. I did say to talk to her about being less noisy. But why should the mom not have a sex life? She is an adult and so is her SO", "Who cares you're grown leave if you want.", "Thank you! I know everybody agrees with me about the PDA part, but the age gap is a big problem too and that's why I was asking myself if I was the asshole here.", "But why would he do that?", "I would.\n\nBut I need to talk to some friends in the neighborhood before leaving, cause right now I have nowhere to go and I had a few drinks tonight.", "Got it!\n\nI guess you're right.\n\nMaybe I could deal with the absurd age gap if things were different. Still awkward, but not upsetting and disturbing to the point that I had no choice but leave.", "He's little more than a boy.  Yes, Mom should have a sex life but not with a 23 year old.", "That's not an age gap, that's an age canyon!", "To be a jerk or because he is insecure.", "Why do dogs bark at people walking by?", "Because if you leave, get upset, confront them he can play the victim! Oh poor me, your daughter hates me despite I was soooo nice to her! \n\nTalk to your mum in private. I wouldn\u2019t bring up the age gap, as it will be the only thing that she hears and focuses on. Instead tell her how uncomfortable it is to hear them \u201csleep\u201d, might mention how thin the walls are, and a few things that you heard.\n\nAs for the BF\u2026 If he tries again with any sexual comment towards your, just say \u201cThis is exactly what you said mum last night at 1am. Please keep these comments in your bedroom\u201d\n\nNTA", "Yes, he's a jerk.\n\nBut a subtle jerk, I guess.\n\nCause he was being kinda \"nice\" to me all day.", "I mean those types of people are usually the first to insist you call him dad when they get married.", "It seems to me that he might be trying to lay claim to the property and her wealth. And is driving you away so she doesn't come to her senses.", "I don't call my dad's wife mom and she's over 40s.", "Key word insist. The wife probably doesn't care or want the title but plenty of others push it for a power play."]}
