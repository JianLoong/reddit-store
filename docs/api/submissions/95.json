My sister and I do not like each other. We never have. She thinks I'm boring and weird. I think she's mean and annoying (especially when she's being a jerk about other people). We never get along. We both tend to agree on one thing; that spending time with each other is the worst thing. We went on vacation in July and our parents set us up to spend an entire day together, just us. She left and there was a huge drama because our parents couldn't find her. So that's the relationship between us. Our parents hate it. Mom especially.\n\nSo she wanted me to stay home with her and hang out and bond I guess. I said no. My mom said it could be the start of us having a better relationship.

If the relationship were better it probably wouldn\u2019t have been as bad of an ask.

To be fair, we made a better relationship after we were out of our teenager and college years to do some real growing up.

I mean why force someone to stay home specifically on Halloween because Halloween \\*fun\\* needs some kind of group - party or whatever.

But I will say that sometimes, in moments of humility, people are more willing to learn. So if you were to find some time to spend with your sister, maybe not tonight but another time, and tell her that you're sorry that this happened to her, it might help your relationship a little bit. If you didn't rub it in her face that she had shitty friends, but told her that you never thought they were nice and hope that she can find better people? Tell her that she deserves better than getting ditched? That might be pretty nice of you to do. And it wouldn't force you to give up  Halloween. It wouldn't really cost you anything to say a few nice words to her. So I would recommend doing that. Often, siblings who hate each other as teenagers can be best friends later in life. And, if she continues to suck, you have no obligation to go out of your way for her. But saying a few nice words can open the door a crack. There may be a day when you need one another. And if you have at least a few nice things in your history, it will be easier to rely on one another if the need for that ever comes. I think that you can take the high road without losing out on your Halloween.", "Nta", "NTA", "Your mom is TA for trying to make you suffer because of your sister's poor choice in friends.

This high school bs isn\u2019t worth it, but she\u2019s gonna get that label too due to the company she keeps and not speaking up. Usually they are afraid to speak up as the nasty girls will turn on them.
