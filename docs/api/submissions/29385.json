Everyone I know who is a guest with family would offer to set the table) and not knowing how to set it yourself. Frankly, if you were so concerned about protecting her from doing these things, you should have set it (as they suggested) - but instead you let her do it without explaining it to her. \n\nBy correcting her, they\u2019re teaching her what you\u2019re not - that there is a right way to do certain things (you can say that people can lay a table however they want, but there\u2019s a convention and social etiquette like that can be important in life).

The truth is it just creates emotionally healthy kids.\n\nAlso - who protests setting a table? Youre family. You should get off your ass and help.

It\u2019s all about attitude and problem solving. Professionalism", "It has to do with table manners, yeah. Start from the outside and work your way in, which you can't do when the cutlery is in the wrong place.", "I put on the plate or in the bowl. If not everyone just grabs from the drawer as I hand them a plate.", "That is so\u2026 dumb", "Every time I see Americans do this I assume they\u2019re doing it wrong because they can\u2019t use a fork with their left hand. It looks so clumsy and awkward. Surprised to see this is specific etiquette. Is this why they hold forks the wrong way around too?", "This is fascinating.  I am going to look this book up!", "You know you could google all that, right? Table setting and etiquette has reasons for where things go. This is what I mean. You don't even know the reasons behind the social norms that you want to defy, and you're not even pointing out flaws in the social norm. You're literally saying that you don't like it because it's a social norm, again with no alternatives or improvements.", "Maybe the child CAN be corrected if the cutlery placement made sense. We cannot expect kids to care about and understand completely unimportant things like cutlery placement. It makes 0 difference in the world. There are so many real problems. \n\nWhen I was a kid I was convinced the moon was mine because it followed me. I would have argued with my parents to the death that the moon cannot follow everyone because the world is huge and there are people all over so it must be following just me because it can\u2019t be in more than one place at once. They gave up because that\u2019s what made sense to me at the time. No need to make me cry about it. \n\nKids brains are still forming and they are trying to make sense of a dangerous and new and exciting and complicated world and that kind of trivial information like utensil placement is just not relevant to a small growing brain.", "I have been to plenty of restaurants in my life. I don\u2019t need to expand my horizons lol. Sometimes they put it on the left, sometimes they put it on the right. Sometimes they go in the middle of the table! Point is, I couldn\u2019t possibly care less.", "Which is why they didn't get mad at her-at first-and just told her where the silverware usually goes. If they had immediately started with insulting her, sure, that's an asshole move. But they thanked her for her work and showed her how they would like to improve it. It's a pretty common teachable moment for kids-if she had forgotten the forks and they had to remind her to get them, do you think that would be wrong of them to bc they corrected her?", "Correction is not synonymous with scolding. They simply showed her how to do it correctly. It\u2019s a learning process and her grandparents did the right thing by correcting her.", "Well it seems the 6 year old had quite a tantrum afterwards. So clearly people have been dropping the ball for a while over there.", "OP, her father could\u2019ve helped her! IF you actually bothered to read he said he was given the option of either him or the child setting the table. OP being too damn lazy/disrespectful in his in-laws house sent his 6 year old to do it by herself.", "But this is so incredibly helpful, lolololol!  Like, I could remember this way!  My pop used to do stuff like this, he would give a completely fictitious reason for something, like ducks fly south because they don\u2019t have mittens for the winter.", "Your dad sounds awesome.", "So cute. I wish he put out a book with this little tricks!", "Your dad must have been adorable to interact with!   He sounds like he was delightful.", "And please let us know what their reasons are for \u201cchoosing\u201d their places \ud83d\ude01", "Not hiring someone because they salt their food isn't professionalism. How does she know they hadn't been there before and already knew the restaurant doesn't put enough salt on the food? Corporate jobs are nowhere near the only job out there, and most \"corporate jobs\" can be done from home. In your pajamas. You don't need to know how to chew with your mouth closed, let alone how to set a table, to do a corporate job.", "Yeah no - you\u2019re still perfectly capable of eating your meal even if the utensils aren\u2019t in the exact right place. Literally never in my life (at least that I can remember) was I ever taught the \u201cproper\u201d way to set a table and I still have perfectly good table manners. Have also never had an issue with eating my food.", "So, do you get completely lost and wind up eating with your fingers if your silverware is all tied up in a napkin bundle when you sit down?", "Yes but like I said, it was more about \"we need to do things differently from how they do it in Europe\" than \"this makes sense\"", "No, I'm not saying I don't like it, I'm saying there's no point in it. There's nothing to like or dislike. If I went somewhere for dinner and they had everything set up properly, I would not even notice. Same if things were set up \"incorrectly\".\n\nMy point is, why the hell should I google this? Is it going to make my life better in any way? Off course not. I don't need to know why it became a thing, what matters is it makes no sense to be worrying about this in freaking 2023.\n\nBesides, your argument about not improving is just stupid. Not having to worry about where I'm putting the fork IS an improvement because it removes a needless concern. Simplifying processes is improving them more often than not.\n\nThere's plenty of social norms that actually do make a difference, this is not one of them.", "If you have to keep bringing up the fact that there are real problems in the world while in an AITA subreddit, maybe you should be tending to those real problems? Why are you in this subreddit if it\u2019s such an issue for you that we\u2019re judging this situation?\n\nI understand that table setting is arbitrary. But, tons of things in our lives are arbitrary and children (and sadly, adults) need to learn how to be corrected \u2014 even over arbitrary things \u2014 without losing it.", "You're free not to care lmao I'm just saying it's more common than not and its not just some outdated thing, at least outside the US", "Sure he could have and the kid\u2019s grandparents could have allowed formal dining etiquette to go for a night because they asked a child to set a table and frankly fuck formal dining etiquette for a 6 year old!", "This is why we eat with our hands \ud83d\ude02 I don't think I'll be able to remember which spoon goes where, lol! \n\nBut on a serious note, I was with dad took the daughter got upset on someone correcting her mistake. \n\nESH", "I want your Dad! I sat through boring classes a week or so every year called etiquette. Your way sounds so much more fun.", "Most people are right handed, and hold a fork in one hand and a knife in the other at the same time,  cutting and eating one bite at a time. Cutting first,  then swapping the fork into your right hand to eat is an American thing,  which is good for salads. Personally I prefer chopsticks, and don't get a Brit. like me started on serving hot food on cold plates.  Anathema!", "> Well, the whole fork-in-the-right-hand thing was a deliberate decision to do things differently from the established etiquette in Europe. \n\nThis is untrue, and you should look it up.\n\nSwitching hands was the fashion in France after forks became widespread, and since France was *sophisticated* it was the fashion throughout Europe and thence the Americas.\n\nBut when Europeans stopped doing it, Americans continued.\n\nAt no point was there a deliberate choice to do things differently from Europeans. At first Americans simply copied what Europeans did, and then they continued doing what they were used to.", "Kids should be taught to be kind and respectful to people. I\u2019m sorry but as an educator, there are some things that really don\u2019t matter and learning needs to be prioritized and where a fork goes just doesn\u2019t make the cut. \n\nI\u2019ve done a lot to enrich the lives of children and live in a way to cause the least amount of harm to the least amount of people. And I have the right to respond to anything I like on here. Thanks for the advice though."]}
