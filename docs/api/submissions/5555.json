My daughter still rides in a high back booster seat, she is 4,3 63 lbs and 10 years old. She has recently started expressing disapproval of it.\n\nA couple weeks ago we were on our way to school and I noticed she had climbed out of her booster seat. I told her to get back in it and she said she was never sitting in it again. I told her that she needed to sit in it because she was too short to ride safely with just the seatbelt. She got upset and started yelling at me saying I'm \" being a jerk\" and \" treating her like a baby\" that she is \" too old for a stupid booster seat\". \n\nAfter a minute my husband came out and asked what was going on, she told him I was being a jerk and treating her like a baby.  He told her not to talk to me that way and that she needed to sit in her booster seat to keep her safe. I then got out of the car and told her that we weren't going anywhere untill she was in her booster seat, and if she made us late by refusing she would deal with the consequences, and that if she continued to refuse and make us late for school or any other event she would be grounded. \n\nAfter that she got back into the booster seat and buckled up.\n\nSince then she hasn't refused again but still complains sometimes. \n\nHer brother told me I was being an AH for treating her like a baby and that I should just let her ride with just the seatbelt. \n\nMy husband says I'm doing the right thing keeping her safe but im still not sure. I mean I'm just trying to keep her safe and she ever complained about her booster seat before. But on the other hand none of her friends still use booster seats and she is getting to that age where peer pressure is a very tough thing. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1671904787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuf14r/aita_for_still_having_my_10_almost_11_year_old/", "score": 465, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re embarrassing her needlessly.", "In the UK, she'd have another 5.5cm to grow in height or reach 12 years of age before she could ride without some sort of seat.\n\nThere's obviously a lot of peer pressure involved and given she's probably wearing 8 to 9yo clothing for that height (uk sizing) I imagine she's significantly behind her peers in height and weight, and the seat probably just emphasises that she's the \"baby\"!\n\nWhat you did was right, imo. But you probably to discuss this calmly and rationally explaining why. There are some great test crash dummy videos online that show the impact of crash at heights needing a chair. Could be a starting point.\n\nAnd perhaps explain that if she is not the height of the y her 12th birthday you'll consider reviewing?", "YTA. Not for your stance on seatbelt safety. But for completely overlooking the fact that if your daughter is suddenly having that strong of a reaction to the booster seat then something has changed. Someone has said something to her. And kids that age can be cruel little assholes. If you can\u2019t understand that this situation is embarrassing for her and at least come up with a compromise, then yes. You are a complete asshole.", "NTA - technically. \n\nI don't buy the argument that if it's legal in your state you should ditch the seat- that's a bare minimum and car crashes are a leading cause of death in kids (Used to be the leading cause- now its guns. Good job America.) \n\nHowever she is unhappy about it- i would sit down with her and explain your reasons, show her the safety data. She isn't a baby, she can be reasoned with. Maybe compromise to a backless one. \n\nMy 10 year old is a peanut- he's the littlest in his grade. He's still in a backless booster.  He has asked if he can get rid of the booster- we had a talk and compromised to letting his get rid of it next summer before middle school. He may not be tall enough yet, but he will be close and it seems fair - he doesn't want to climb out of a booster and go to homeroom and I don't blame him. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAs a parent you get to have your big black lines that aren't crossed.

My 10 year old is 51 inches and still sits on one. Most of his friends under 4\u20199 still do as well. One thing I have done, however, is to give him the option of not sitting on it if we have his friends in the car who don\u2019t still use a backless booster. That seems to be a fair compromise that he\u2019s happy with.", "NAH. I was in a booster seat at least until that age. I was around your daughters height. I would definitely look into ones without a back. Just the seat is all that\u2019s necessary and could be an easy compromise for another year or so. I totally get where your coming from, but if she continues to be a small child this is something I would HIGHLY recommend you reconsider after another year.  It\u2019s never bad to take the extra precaution, except she will feel extremely self conscious about it and resent you if you insist on a booster seat when she\u2019s 12+. \nI\u2019m only 5 feet, I don\u2019t actually remember when I reached 4\u20199\u201d but I think we gave up on the seat before that.", "The amount of uneducated (on car seat safety) people on this post who think that just because something is \u2018legal\u2019 means it\u2019s totally safe is ridiculous.", "YTA.

You don\u2019t just strap her in when she\u2019s clearly not understanding it, feeling embarrassed and hating it. Talk to your child like she is a person and discuss your reasons on why she is in that seat and ask her what to you guys can do in the meantime (until she can safely just use a seat belt) to make her feel less embarrassed. Figure out a compromise. She will be 18 in 8 years and if you think she will forget how you invalidate her feelings, you\u2019re kidding yourself. instead of wasting time garnering internet points because you feel guilty, maybe just go talk to your kid.

My province has the legal age set to 8.", "Oooh, a legitimately interesting question on this sub!\n\nMy vote is: NAH.\n\nOn your part, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re focused on child safety. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to protect your child from harm, and when your kid is young, that\u2019s like 90% of the job.\n\nBut now your kid is a pre-teen, and your job has changed a bit. You have to start letting go. She can\u2019t develop into her own person until she can start making her own choices, even if they aren\u2019t always objectively the best or even the safest. If you just say \u201cno, it\u2019s my way or the highway\u201d on every major decision, several things are going to happen over the next few years. She\u2019ll stop listening to you. She\u2019ll treat every disagreement as a power struggle. She\u2019ll pull away from you, and she may start lying and deceiving you to cover up the things she wants to do that you will simply say no to.\n\nPlease go read some articles on permissive/authoritarian/authoritative parenting styles.\n\nAnd what you should have done/should do now:\n\n1) validate her feelings, and agree with whatever you can. If you don\u2019t agree, just repeat back her words. Her feelings are valid and are not wrong. \u201cI hear that you\u2019re embarrassed about being in a car seat. I know you\u2019re growing up and it\u2019s important what your friends think. I also hear that you feel like I\u2019m babying you\u201d.\n\n2) explain what you need. \u201cI need you to be safe. Here are some statistics about children in car seats vs just the lap belt.\u201d And also: \u201cI can\u2019t have that discussion right when we\u2019re leaving for school, because we both need to be on time.\u201d\n\n3) get her buy-in on working on a compromise\n\u201cCan we figure out a solution we can both live with?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we agree to talk about this after dinner tonight?\u201d\n\n4) actually work out a compromise. That means you have to do some research to justify your position. Is it legal in your state? What do the stats say about the actual numbers? And then figure out what you can give in on. Maybe a backless car seat instead of a five-point. Or maybe you\u2019ll agree to skip it for the drive to school but she\u2019ll agree to get in it for long highway drives. Or you\u2019ll agree on a date (11th birthday?) to make the change. You\u2019re going to have to give something.\n\nBut the most important thing is to make her feel heard.\n\nMy final thing is: I suggest you work on letting go a bit. When your kids are preteens and teenagers, you can\u2019t *and shouldn\u2019t* protect them from every risk. For example, I know a mom who insisted on walking her kid to and from school every day until the daughter was 14 years old. That is too long (imho) to have mommy making sure you don\u2019t get abducted. Don\u2019t be that parent.", "I dont think you are necessarily the AH here, however i do think you are completely ignoring your daughters mental wellness and hyper fixating on her physical safety. She says shes embarrassed and feels infantilized, and any attempt to talk to you about it has been shut down. She will be bottling this up and letting whatever feelings she has towards you grow and fester.\n\nYou need to talk with her about this. she is old enough to be talked to and have things explained to her. Work on a compromise. Even if her friends haven't bullied her, that doesnt mean other kids havent. kids are MEAN.

I told her to get back in it and she said she was never sitting in it again. I told her that she needed to sit in it because she was too short to ride safely with just the seatbelt. She got upset and started yelling at me saying I'm \" being a jerk\" and \" treating her like a baby\" that she is \" too old for a stupid booster seat\". \n\nAfter a minute my husband came out and asked what was going on, she told him I was being a jerk and treating her like a baby.  He told her not to talk to me that way and that she needed to sit in her booster seat to keep her safe. I then got out of the car and told her that we weren't going anywhere untill she was in her booster seat, and if she made us late by refusing she would deal with the consequences, and that if she continued to refuse and make us late for school or any other event she would be grounded. \n\nAfter that she got back into the booster seat and buckled up.\n\nSince then she hasn't refused again but still complains sometimes. \n\nHer brother told me I was being an AH for treating her like a baby and that I should just let her ride with just the seatbelt. \n\nMy husband says I'm doing the right thing keeping her safe but im still not sure. I mean I'm just trying to keep her safe and she ever complained about her booster seat before.

If they need a booster, it should be backless at that age.", "drugs are legal in some countries, that doesnt make them safe.", "Again, ad infinitum, we don\u2019t KNOW what best practice is, because best practice is determined by height and age and OP has not stated the child\u2019s height (that I\u2019ve seen).  The legal standards are the ONLY thing we can go by.", "You missed the point. Our booster seats and seatbelts are designed to meet our safety standards. Her keeping a child that is much too big in a booster is unsafe. Most boosters here aren\u2019t designed for large children and she is using one past the time it\u2019s safe. YTA btw", "That has no bearing on car seat/booster guidelines.", "As far as I\u2019ve seen, OP has not stated the child\u2019s height, which is critical for knowing what the safest course is.  Therefore, we are left to go by the legal recommendation, which states that the child should be out of backed booster seats.  And by that standard, OP is not doing what is safest, necessarily, only what they want to do.  Which is controlling and infantilizing.", "When I was 10 years old, I rode in the open back of my uncle's pick up truck, going 70 mph down the highway. It wasn't against state requirements, so I guess it was safe?", "The medical recommendation is based on height and age.  Since I have not seen OP mention anywhere the height of the child, only age and weight, I have to go by the legal recommendation, which OP admits states that their child should not be in a backed booster at that age.", "My thoughts exactly", "Same. I have a tall skinny kid. He needs the booster just barely for height but we use the seat only and no one is the wiser. If the high back is causing the embarrassment, why not switch to a seat booster only? I can't imagine a kid her age needs a high back for good seat posture/behavior and it seems like it's actually causing issues.", "Why not when she's walking around? Or in the car? Or god forbid, running?\n\nMore importantly, once you answer that question, why can't you apply the same logic, where you let your daughter run without wearing a helmet (or ride in a car without a helmet), to your daughter being allowed to sit not in a gd high back booster seat at age 10?\n\nAs safe as possible is an unhealthy and unrealistic standard.", "My grandma uses a throw pillow to sit on when she drives so she can see properly", "I had a truck that wouldn't turn on the passenger air bag because I didn't weigh enough or cause the seat belt to come out far enough to cause it to turn on.  So I had to sit there holding the seatbelt out far enough or hang on to the seat and pull myself in to it to trick the scale.  I'm not even short or unusually light. 5 4, 105. Not cool.", "Yep, my eldest was so happy when he turned 12! He was prem and hasn't as yet (if?) Caught up entirely with his mates in height terms, although my youngest is nearly 9 and was also prem but he's shooting up pretty fast!", "Hmm. My mom 87, is now a bit shorter than me at 4'11\" and has osteoporosis. Maybe she should ride in a special seat  Thank god she stopped driving on her own", "Agreed that an adult\u2019s bones aren\u2019t the same as a young kid, but a 10-year-old\u2019s bones aren\u2019t the same bones as a young kid\u2019s. I was always the shortest or second shortest in a class. I would have felt this was infantilizing, and would have been humiliated. Sounds like OP\u2019s daughter feels that way too. OP, YTA. Please readjust your thinking, make amends to your daughter, and figure out an appropriate way to retire the booster seat together. Perhaps you two can have a bonfire with it.", "Which makes an adult a far more dangerous projectile in an accident.\n\nBome density has absolutely nothing to do with booster seat laws and recommendations.", "They do! My step mom is 4'11\" and has to use a kind of booster to drive or she can't see over the hood of the car lol", "Yeah, but that would require car manufacturers to take into account the needs of a diverse group of people. Right now, cars are built for the safety of the average, slim man.  Everyone else is an afterthought.", "Shorter people (usually women) have higher fatality rates in car accidents because of this. Seatbelts are made for the average sized adult man. OP is keeping her kid safe. NTA.", "If you're under 4'10 as an adult that's considered dwarfism.

Someone that short would be considered to have dwarfism. 0.0009% of the population is that height or shorter...", "In many states the law says 4'9 before you are out of a booster for children under 12; many have outlawed booster seats that do not have a high back on them due to the severity of injuries that still happen in the event of a car accident with the boosters that don't have a high back. The high-back boosters still use the car's seat belt, they are not a 5-point harness like a younger child would use as a car seat.", "Where do the legs go? For real, I'm asking, I cannot picture it", "Don't listen to this person! You are NTA! My kids were all on the smaller side and I kept them rear facing till about 3 per pediatrician recommendation and in their boosters after they outgrew the regular carseats till almost 12 long before the recommendations and laws started to change. You are absolutely doing the right thing. Seatbelts are extremely dangerous for those who are too small for them and I have taken care of kids who were allowed to sit in a seatbelt before they were big enough and were almost killed by the belt. A belt should be able to sit across their hips and clavicle without being adjusted to be safe.", "INFO: What information do you have that suggests that it\u2019s safe to keep her in the booster seat beyond the recommended height and weight requirements?", "Right after unintentional accidents comes intentional self harm in top causes of death for 10-14 year olds. Take the back off the booster.", "You are a helicopter mom and you will pay for it later on.", "Have you done this test with your daughter? Clearly she\u2019s embarrassed by the seat. While I understand where you\u2019re coming from, you should try to find some sort of compromise. A no-back seat is perfectly safe, you can get a black or grey one without patterns or color so it is more discreet. My kids are younger and smaller than yours and the seat belt is safely on their bodies with the no-back seat. It was a requirement for the back to come off for me.", "Can you do one without a high back so it lifts her up so the seatbelt works safely but looks less like a carseat?", "You clearly have the best intentions and I applaud you for that. It\u2019s not fun having to enforce safety precautions\u2026.BUT, she doesn\u2019t need the high back part any more, just the booster part.  See if just using the booster part alone is a compromise your daughter can live with. She will also see you do care about her thoughts.  I think the high back part is the more babyish part anyway and she shouldn\u2019t need that anymore.", "Did your daughter do the 5 step test or are you not treating her like her brother? I mean, if even her older brother tries to talk to you, you should really think about the situation.", "Which seat is this? I think mine only goes up to 80lbs", "But the OP doesn\u2019t appear to have any evidence that keeping her daughter in the child seat will increase her safety. Also, it\u2019s causing tremendous conflict.", "It keeps them sitting upright much easier especially if there is any chance of them falling asleep in the car. I feel like kids treat it a bit more like a car seat too and are less likely to lean all over the place in it which is really unsafe. It also provides more head support which a lot of cars don\u2019t have. The seatbelt can be in the correct position easier in a high back.\n\nhttps://thecarseatlady.com/why-boosters-work/\n\nFor a 7 year old, I\u2019d do a high back for a while if you can. My 9 year old is still in a high back because she wiggles way less in it than a backless one.", "True, but it means she\u2019s starting puberty.

Are they a helicopter parent? Perhaps, but they may be genuinely worried about safety. There is no way you can say they are trying to control and don care off of this. I swear to God this subreddit is full of people who push their own insecurities into others.", "Just because the law states she is not required to be in a booster doesn't mean the seats are not designed to have bigger children, that's a completely separate issue. The legal requirement is the bare minimum.", "It was a typo, thanks for catching it. It was supposed to say legal does NOT make it safe.", "LOL, they're all made in the same place. I know you guys like to think you all have giant cars, but easily 80% of the cars you have are the cars we have.", ">>My daughter still rides in a high back booster seat, she is 4,3 63 lbs and 10 years old.", "Op stated in the post the kid is 4\u20193\u201d, so still we\u2019ll within the guidelines for many high back boosters. Depends on the particular seat they have of course.", "She said that she\u2019s 4\u20193\u201d which is a half a foot shorter than the actual safety recommendations.", "Your thoughts aren\u2019t smart", "That might be a bit dangerous . If the pillow isn't somehow attached to the seat , it might slip and cause a loss of control .", "The stigma is on using a booster made for young children.

My son was very tall, but quite young when we switched forward\u2026.he reached the limits early.", "They just sit cross legged or put their feet up on the seat. It doesn't look super comfortable, but none of the kids I know had an issue sitting like this.", "Watch kids sit when they aren\u2019t in a car seat.

A 10 year old typically has enough muscle tone to sit up straight without the assistance of a high back seat. Booster may be needed but the high back is overkill and that's the most visible and embarrassing part of the seat.", "I mean, maybe but she's been doing this for the past 50 years or so that she's been driving so I guess it works for her", "NTA, maybe you could get her backless booster. I just saw that she needs to grow at least 20cm (around 8inches) to be allowed to ride a car without a booster im my country. So i completly see your point.
