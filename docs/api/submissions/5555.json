My daughter still rides in a high back booster seat, she is 4,3 63 lbs and 10 years old. She has recently started expressing disapproval of it.\n\nA couple weeks ago we were on our way to school and I noticed she had climbed out of her booster seat. I told her to get back in it and she said she was never sitting in it again. I told her that she needed to sit in it because she was too short to ride safely with just the seatbelt. She got upset and started yelling at me saying I'm \" being a jerk\" and \" treating her like a baby\" that she is \" too old for a stupid booster seat\". \n\nAfter a minute my husband came out and asked what was going on, she told him I was being a jerk and treating her like a baby.  He told her not to talk to me that way and that she needed to sit in her booster seat to keep her safe. I then got out of the car and told her that we weren't going anywhere untill she was in her booster seat, and if she made us late by refusing she would deal with the consequences, and that if she continued to refuse and make us late for school or any other event she would be grounded. \n\nAfter that she got back into the booster seat and buckled up.\n\nSince then she hasn't refused again but still complains sometimes. \n\nHer brother told me I was being an AH for treating her like a baby and that I should just let her ride with just the seatbelt. \n\nMy husband says I'm doing the right thing keeping her safe but im still not sure. I mean I'm just trying to keep her safe and she ever complained about her booster seat before. But on the other hand none of her friends still use booster seats and she is getting to that age where peer pressure is a very tough thing. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1671904787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuf14r/aita_for_still_having_my_10_almost_11_year_old/", "score": 8010, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re embarrassing her needlessly.", "In the UK, she'd have another 5.5cm to grow in height or reach 12 years of age before she could ride without some sort of seat.\n\nThere's obviously a lot of peer pressure involved and given she's probably wearing 8 to 9yo clothing for that height (uk sizing) I imagine she's significantly behind her peers in height and weight, and the seat probably just emphasises that she's the \"baby\"!\n\nWhat you did was right, imo. But you probably to discuss this calmly and rationally explaining why. There are some great test crash dummy videos online that show the impact of crash at heights needing a chair. Could be a starting point.\n\nAnd perhaps explain that if she is not the height of the y her 12th birthday you'll consider reviewing?", "YTA. Not for your stance on seatbelt safety. But for completely overlooking the fact that if your daughter is suddenly having that strong of a reaction to the booster seat then something has changed. Someone has said something to her. And kids that age can be cruel little assholes. If you can\u2019t understand that this situation is embarrassing for her and at least come up with a compromise, then yes. You are a complete asshole.", "NTA - technically. \n\nI don't buy the argument that if it's legal in your state you should ditch the seat- that's a bare minimum and car crashes are a leading cause of death in kids (Used to be the leading cause- now its guns. Good job America.) \n\nHowever she is unhappy about it- i would sit down with her and explain your reasons, show her the safety data. She isn't a baby, she can be reasoned with. Maybe compromise to a backless one. \n\nMy 10 year old is a peanut- he's the littlest in his grade. He's still in a backless booster.  He has asked if he can get rid of the booster- we had a talk and compromised to letting his get rid of it next summer before middle school. He may not be tall enough yet, but he will be close and it seems fair - he doesn't want to climb out of a booster and go to homeroom and I don't blame him. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAs a parent you get to have your big black lines that aren't crossed.

My 10 year old is 51 inches and still sits on one. Most of his friends under 4\u20199 still do as well. One thing I have done, however, is to give him the option of not sitting on it if we have his friends in the car who don\u2019t still use a backless booster. That seems to be a fair compromise that he\u2019s happy with.", "NAH. I was in a booster seat at least until that age. I was around your daughters height. I would definitely look into ones without a back. Just the seat is all that\u2019s necessary and could be an easy compromise for another year or so. I totally get where your coming from, but if she continues to be a small child this is something I would HIGHLY recommend you reconsider after another year.  It\u2019s never bad to take the extra precaution, except she will feel extremely self conscious about it and resent you if you insist on a booster seat when she\u2019s 12+. \nI\u2019m only 5 feet, I don\u2019t actually remember when I reached 4\u20199\u201d but I think we gave up on the seat before that.", "The amount of uneducated (on car seat safety) people on this post who think that just because something is \u2018legal\u2019 means it\u2019s totally safe is ridiculous.", "YTA.

You don\u2019t just strap her in when she\u2019s clearly not understanding it, feeling embarrassed and hating it. Talk to your child like she is a person and discuss your reasons on why she is in that seat and ask her what to you guys can do in the meantime (until she can safely just use a seat belt) to make her feel less embarrassed. Figure out a compromise. She will be 18 in 8 years and if you think she will forget how you invalidate her feelings, you\u2019re kidding yourself. instead of wasting time garnering internet points because you feel guilty, maybe just go talk to your kid.

Most children will not fit in a seat belt alone until 10 to 12 years of age.  \n\nThat said. My province has the legal age set to 8.", "Oooh, a legitimately interesting question on this sub!\n\nMy vote is: NAH.\n\nOn your part, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re focused on child safety. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to protect your child from harm, and when your kid is young, that\u2019s like 90% of the job.\n\nBut now your kid is a pre-teen, and your job has changed a bit. You have to start letting go. She can\u2019t develop into her own person until she can start making her own choices, even if they aren\u2019t always objectively the best or even the safest. If you just say \u201cno, it\u2019s my way or the highway\u201d on every major decision, several things are going to happen over the next few years. She\u2019ll stop listening to you. She\u2019ll treat every disagreement as a power struggle. She\u2019ll pull away from you, and she may start lying and deceiving you to cover up the things she wants to do that you will simply say no to.\n\nPlease go read some articles on permissive/authoritarian/authoritative parenting styles.\n\nAnd what you should have done/should do now:\n\n1) validate her feelings, and agree with whatever you can. If you don\u2019t agree, just repeat back her words. Her feelings are valid and are not wrong. \u201cI hear that you\u2019re embarrassed about being in a car seat. I know you\u2019re growing up and it\u2019s important what your friends think. I also hear that you feel like I\u2019m babying you\u201d.\n\n2) explain what you need. \u201cI need you to be safe. Here are some statistics about children in car seats vs just the lap belt.\u201d And also: \u201cI can\u2019t have that discussion right when we\u2019re leaving for school, because we both need to be on time.\u201d\n\n3) get her buy-in on working on a compromise\n\u201cCan we figure out a solution we can both live with?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we agree to talk about this after dinner tonight?\u201d\n\n4) actually work out a compromise. That means you have to do some research to justify your position. Is it legal in your state? What do the stats say about the actual numbers? And then figure out what you can give in on. Maybe a backless car seat instead of a five-point. Or maybe you\u2019ll agree to skip it for the drive to school but she\u2019ll agree to get in it for long highway drives. Or you\u2019ll agree on a date (11th birthday?) to make the change. You\u2019re going to have to give something.\n\nBut the most important thing is to make her feel heard.\n\nMy final thing is: I suggest you work on letting go a bit. When your kids are preteens and teenagers, you can\u2019t *and shouldn\u2019t* protect them from every risk. For example, I know a mom who insisted on walking her kid to and from school every day until the daughter was 14 years old. That is too long (imho) to have mommy making sure you don\u2019t get abducted. Don\u2019t be that parent.", "I dont think you are necessarily the AH here, however i do think you are completely ignoring your daughters mental wellness and hyper fixating on her physical safety. She says shes embarrassed and feels infantilized, and any attempt to talk to you about it has been shut down. She will be bottling this up and letting whatever feelings she has towards you grow and fester.\n\nYou need to talk with her about this. she is old enough to be talked to and have things explained to her. Work on a compromise. Even if her friends haven't bullied her, that doesnt mean other kids havent. kids are MEAN. I knew a kid in a booster up until middle school and that poor kid was bullied relentlessly.

I told her to get back in it and she said she was never sitting in it again. I told her that she needed to sit in it because she was too short to ride safely with just the seatbelt. She got upset and started yelling at me saying I'm \" being a jerk\" and \" treating her like a baby\" that she is \" too old for a stupid booster seat\". \n\nAfter a minute my husband came out and asked what was going on, she told him I was being a jerk and treating her like a baby.  He told her not to talk to me that way and that she needed to sit in her booster seat to keep her safe. I then got out of the car and told her that we weren't going anywhere untill she was in her booster seat, and if she made us late by refusing she would deal with the consequences, and that if she continued to refuse and make us late for school or any other event she would be grounded. \n\nAfter that she got back into the booster seat and buckled up.\n\nSince then she hasn't refused again but still complains sometimes. \n\nHer brother told me I was being an AH for treating her like a baby and that I should just let her ride with just the seatbelt. \n\nMy husband says I'm doing the right thing keeping her safe but im still not sure. I mean I'm just trying to keep her safe and she ever complained about her booster seat before.

Ugh.  This woman is right to keep using it until her kid is the right size for a regular seat belt.  \nI don't care a fig what her peers think - they need some basic physics lectures!", "I got asked once if I had a hickey. Nope, seatbelt had just been rubbing my neck on a long journey", "The female test dummy's don't even have breasts!!! I don't get how they can say they are safe for us.

I read through your replies and it seems that you are unwilling to take any advice that is against high-back booster seats. It comes off as you cherry-picking responses you want to hear. Just because you have her safety in your best interest does not mean you are right. The main concern is that she doesn't need to use the high-back boosters, but you are forcing her. It gives you peace of mind, but to her, it's mortifying and frustrating.\n\nIf the seatbelt is irritating her neck, a backless booster seat should help give her height so it doesn't bother her. This is a better alternative that she would more likely agree with. You can agree with her that when she's 11, she can graduate from boosters and sit on seats (for example). She won't sit on boosters forever when there is no need to. You could also buy those seatbelt sleeves too.\n\nShe's almost 11 years old and this will affect her mental health more than you think. She's going to be teased for it and develop a negative association with car rides. You need to find something REASONABLE that you BOTH agree on and that she understands. That does not mean showing her statistics, she probably would not care or understand.\n\nKids around that age begin developing more in-depth perceptions of their parents and the last thing you want is for them to believe you're an excessive parent. Many of us here agree that you're an AH and you're not doing any favors for your kid.", "Also those seats are generally not built for kids as tall as OP's daughter is, which means it will harm her if she is involved in a crash.

It\u2019s weird that child quality of life and bullying / school appearance hasn\u2019t been a concern to me. Maybe they are helicopter parents I don\u2019t know. Kids grow up and we need to make that experience tolerable for them. We go to work all day and they go to school. Kids are merciless and don\u2019t have the same filters that adults do. What\u2019s more is if she goes to school with these kids through high school, that reputation could easily follow her. Mental health matters.

We found a booster seat that looks like a cushion (no sides or back, marches seat  color, etc.)  After we explained what could happen in an accident with a seat belt across his neck, he was willing to use it.
