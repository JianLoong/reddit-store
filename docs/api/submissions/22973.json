I was invited long before but didn\u2019t really want to go because I knew I would be jet lagged from my vacation that was scheduled before his for my dad\u2019s birthday. I ended up agreeing to go upon his insistence, for 2 days, right after a 6 hour flight. It was a 7 hour drive to get there. \n\nWhen I get there, his mom speaks to me as little as possible, which is nothing out of the ordinary. She\u2019s decided that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t approve of me\u201d I think because she invited herself to my grandpa\u2019s funeral who she never met without asking me (a whole other story). \n\nAll is fine though until about 9, when everyone decided to call it a night. I went upstairs which was by her room to get a snack where she asked me if I needed anything to get ready for bed and suggested that she needed to go to sleep so hopefully our show wasn\u2019t too much longer. I was confused because I didn\u2019t really think I would have a bedtime (at 21 years old) and was even more confused about why she couldn\u2019t sleep until I did. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought possible she was worried I would wake her up when I went to sleep since the couch was right by her room. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m not tired and slightly annoyed that she\u2019s treating me like a toddler. I usually could go to sleep around 10, but I just got back from a place that was 4 hours behind and didn\u2019t really think I could sleep. I go up there around 11, still slightly annoyed but trying to make the best of the situation. I tell her goodnight while looking right at her sitting in bed with the light on and she ignores me. Weird, but whatever. Then she turns off the light and leaves the door open, quite literally watching me while I sleep. I\u2019m beyond being nice at this point, and I just go close her door. She opens it again. I tell my boyfriend what\u2019s going on and he comes and closes it and it stays shut. \n\nThe coffee maker comes on at 5 am the next morning. No one warned me, and I was started awake and couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. His mom gets up about 7:30 (so why she would want two hour old coffee is beyond me) and was super cheerful, nice and enthusiastic when she saw my boyfriend around. At this point I\u2019m like \u201cscrew this\u201d and packed up my stuff and put it in the car to leave.\n\nNow my boyfriend is mad at me for \u201cruining his trip\u201d by leaving. He also says I\u2019m being an asshole by expecting him to defend me and therefore creating tension on this trip. Maybe I\u2019m still angry about being watched like a toddler while I sleep or her fake behavior towards me when my boyfriend is around, but I don\u2019t really how me staying would\u2019ve led to it not being \u201cruined\u201d.", "created_utc": 1690117040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157e7ni/aita_for_leaving_my_f21_boyfriends_m21_family/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019ll never win with them, and it doesn\u2019t sound like he will ever stick up for you.", "Yeah... NTA. You bent over backwards to accommodate going on the trip, being watched, the whole nine.

If your BF doesn't have your back, why is he your BF.\n\nI think you should have stood your ground and not gone.  You were jet lagged the travel logistics were not reasonable.", "Leave.

If you were uncomfortable, it\u2019s best to go home, but it does feel like some of your issues are a bit contrived. \n\nRegarding the funeral, it may be a difference of cultural beliefs. Funerals for many catholic families are incredibly large affairs wherein everybody is welcome. It was a bit of a faux-pas, but in general attending a funeral is seen as a significant sign of support.\n\nFor the \u201cbed time\u201d, it is possible that BF\u2019s Mom simply wanted to indicate she was going to bed; and as you were next to her, not to keep her up. Given she doesn\u2019t want you and BF sleeping together, the door may have been also to keep watch which is definitely too much. The door opening/closing sounds passive agressive from all sides, and a better solution would have been you taking a room and your BF sleeping on the couch, but that\u2019s just me.\n\nI think it\u2019s been established the coffee couldn\u2019t possibly have been anyone\u2019s fault, but I do understand if it sent you over the edge given you were jet lagged and tired.\n\nLastly, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot for your BF to defend over the trip, given that many issues seem on-going.

Why were you sleeping on the couch? Where was the bf sleeping?", "NTA \n\nBoyfriend needs to hear you out and you need to explain calmly, that when he is not there she behaves differently. \n\nAlso,  was the show keeping her up?

Ex-boyfriend right!", " EDIT.

She asked you if you needed anything - not told you to go to bed. \n\nThere\u2019s really no communication with her as well, just you assuming she has it in for you or something. The door thing sounds weird, but maybe she sleeps with the door open? Idk. \n\nAlso.

Could be standard for her(she may get up earlier normally and it's just habit).  Did she do this to annoy you?  Doubtful.\n\nThis sounds like some disparate habits colliding but instead of using your words you packed up your proverbial marbles and went home.\n\nYeah, I'd suggest that at 21 you have some growing up to do.  \n\nBoyfriend could use some growing up too since he can't take NO for an answer and put you in an uncomfortable situation(why did you have to sleep on couch?)", "YTA.

You knew what the sleeping arrangements would be, you knew you didn't get along with his mother, and you knew you'd be jetlagged.\n\nThis was a 2-day thing and you had already spent one day of it.

Maybe she just lacks emotional intelligence, but my family was furious that they hadn\u2019t even met her and she thought that she could just show up to a small intimate ceremony without even asking if she could come.", "This is not going to end well for your relationship, op. This is going to cause issues between him and his mother, you and him, and you and his mother. This is going to get way messier than you\u2019re probably anticipating. He honestly sounds slightly like a mommas boy. Mommas are always chosen over the girlfriend, and if he defends and sides with you then you\u2019ll most likely never have a good relationship with your ILs.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re in a good place when you start this convo.", "It\u2019s not weird for somebody to attend a funeral and it\u2019s not weird for them to not ask you. The visitation information is practically always public and people just show up. You just want to not like this woman", "Ahh, well, you like being treated with respect, so you left. \n\nGood luck in your convo with him. He needs to see your poverty and if he won't, you know all you need to.", "Ok, OP. TBH, this answers my question. \nShe was being nosy when she went to the funeral.  \nGlad I ask. I am editing to NTA as I had questions before. I, personally believe she has issues with your race, religion, creed, whatever. These kind of people just hate. And yes, that is my response. Edit: BTW, I live around these kind of people.\nShe won\u2019t change, and I am sorry I say that. I wish you only the very best. It is hard to live around these people. Can\u2019t imagine vacationing with them.", "Well, typically funerals are not an invitation-only event, its a show up to offer your condolences type of thing. \n\nI mean, thats why the details are printed in obituaries\u2026", "I unfortunately was already kind of thinking this. I\u2019ve been hinting that we need to talk \u2026. I just can\u2019t imagine having to deal with someone who doesn\u2019t respect or like me for the next indefinite time period. I also have been kinda thinking he\u2019s a momma\u2019s boy, which would be fine if the mom was as nice to me as she is to him. \ud83d\ude02 Thank you!", "Why would someone show up to a funeral for a person they didn\u2019t know? And then get mad they weren\u2019t invited? I\u2019m so confused as to what you\u2019re even talking about.", "It wasn\u2019t public. Maybe not weird for her to ask me, but was rude that she never said anything to me regarding it, regardless of whether she planned to attend the funeral or not. But you\u2019re entitled to your opinion, I won\u2019t budge that it was weird as hell from my pov.", "Precisely. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThank you, good luck with your endeavors as well!", "That's not necessarily true. Catholic funerals are very large affairs. Pretty much if you in any way knew the person you can go.\n\nIt sounds much more like cultural differences that just aren't meshing well. And it's not helped by the fact that the boyfriend basically set them up to fail by telling OP that if she crossed his mom she would get mad. He really didn't give them a chance.", "A lot of funerals are, and why would you show up to a funeral of someone you don\u2019t know if you weren\u2019t invited anyway? That\u2019s just weird", "His details weren\u2019t, it was a 20 person graveside service. I still can\u2019t wrap my head around how you think that\u2019s ok, but I appreciate you sharing your opinion!", "Please have a talk with him about needing a separation. That way he can go spend time with mommy and see if she\u2019s the one he wants to be with forever.   Imagine how imaged be for your wedding?  Or having kids?!!!  Ooof", "I\u2019m just confused why we\u2019re gatekeeping funerals", "BF\u2019s mother was told it was a quiet funeral. OP isn\u2019t Catholic but she is Asian. BF\u2019s mother was, IMO a just trying to be nosy when going to funeral. She knew OP wasn\u2019t Catholic. \nFor sure, if it were a large event and someone wanted to show up at the church ceremony or funeral home to honor the deceased, that is a nice thing.", "Looks like OP\u2019s Bf\u2019s family are catholic - funerals for them are a big to-do. Open invite, many times a party after, etc.", "Well, then its an awkward social faux pas on her part - but do you think she was there to be mean? Or likely hey my son\u2019s gf died, ill attend the funeral to be supportive? \n\nOnce again, this goes back to what I was saying - there doesnt seem to be actual communication and just you being determined to dislike her.", "Did your bf go to the funeral?", "Nothing you\u2019re saying makes any sense. Move along maybe.", "I mean, that\u2019s fine, but shouldn\u2019t you clear it w/ the hosts that it\u2019s ok for you to attend. Like it\u2019s just plain inconsiderate to show up to someone\u2019s funeral, when the family hosting the funeral isn\u2019t catholic, just because you\u2019re used to open invite funerals. The bf is also in the wrong for sharing the funeral details w/ his mom, even if he was invited to attend. He was there to support OP, not tell random people completely unrelated to the dead person abt the funeral, and where and when it\u2019s located. Those people are mourning the loss of a loved one, they don\u2019t need some creep showing up like that so she can stalk her son and his gf", "If she wanted to be supportive I would\u2019ve greatly appreciated her saying to me that she was sorry for my loss or even acknowledging my grandpa\u2019s death but instead she just asked her son for the address without asking me if she should or could come. My mom (who just lost her father) didn\u2019t want to meet her that day and I feel like it would\u2019ve been unfair to her.", "Yes, I wanted him there.", "It\u2019s a free country. If OP doesn\u2019t have to make sense to me then I don\u2019t have to make sense to you", "I think youre missing the actual context - we\u2019re all just assuming here of course - but for catholic funerals there arent invitations, you dont have to *clear it with the hosts*. You literally just show up. For example, my friends father died recently - funeral details were known, so myself and our other friends went to the church for the funeral. I had never met his father but we were there to be supportive of our friend. \n\nAttending the funeral was very likely an overstep on the mom\u2019s part but do you think she attended a funeral to be malicious? Or that it really just was a misunderstanding.", "All very valid reasons and I do agree with you given it was an intimate funeral but what do you think her *intentions* were?", "Maybe she invited herself so she could creep on the two of you and make sure you aren\u2019t too intimate. Fucking creep. Was gonna say if he wasn\u2019t invited, that it\u2019s way more creepy cuz she went and got the details of a funeral from your bf that neither of them were invited to attend and then showed up so she can creep on you. Your bf is really insensitive tho for sharing the funeral details w/ his mom, he should not have done so w/out your permission", "But why are you attending a funeral for someone who you don\u2019t know know them or their family when you have a bad relationship with the only person related to the person who died. And THE BF WAS INVITED <\u2014\u2014\u2014 so there were invitations, know this, it should be very obvious that people who aren\u2019t invited don\u2019t attend, so the bf and the mom are both in the wrong here, the bf telling his mom abt it and the mom for showing up.", "I personally think her intentions were to meet my family because she tried to arrange a dinner for all of us prior to the funeral (a week before) which we had to bail on because we all got the flu. I arranged a makeup a dinner all together a couple days after the funeral.", "Wait. What in the massive giant leap is this\u2026?! \n\nYou think Mom attended to the funeral to make sure her son and OP weren\u2019t mackin it at grandpa\u2019s grave in front of OP\u2019s family. \n\nWe get it, you think Mom is an AH but can we at least stick to the realm of possibility?"]}
