There were six of us, four of whom are very heavy drinkers. I've been unemployed for the past five months because of health issues and I don't drink at all, both of these facts my friends are well aware of. \n\nWe ate a pricey Asian fusion restaurant and a lot of the dishes were shared. I don't have much of an appetite, so  ate a quarter of a portion of rice, two pieces of sweet and sour pork and nibbled a bit on soft shell crab and drink-wise, I'd just had a red bull. \n\nDuring dinner, the four guys easily put away ten plus cocktails individually and were ordering more and more portions of food all of which they ate.\n\nIn my head because we had a lot of shared dishes so I was already resigned to having to pay at least like maybe $50-60 to cover the food even though what I ate (I double checked the menu for this) only amounted to a little over $25. \n\nHere's where it gets dicey: the bill comes and it's just over a grand. We agreed to have one person pay and that we'd all transfer them afterwards. I go to the bathroom and upon returning am told that everyone agreed to split evenly and that everyone had already transferred the money but me. \n\nI was expected to pay almost $200 for food I barely ate and alcohol I didn't even drink. I flat out refused and said that I couldn't afford to pay that and that we should recalculate and have the people who drank cover what they'd ordered. I am told no because it's 'too much of a hassle.' \n\nThe night ends with one friend stepping in and saying he was going to 'tank' my portion of the bill and that I could just pay him back - but that's completely beside the point? \n\nWe've had situations like this before, last time we went out I spent $15 on pasta and split four ways on a $60 shisha whilst the rest drank. I had to pay $150 and was told to be grateful because money was taken off what I had to pay because I drove the entire group home since I was the only one sober. \n\nShould I just have scraped into my bank account paid the bill? I'm feeling like bad about the whole thing because the friend who covered for both of us spent $400 which is by no means a small amount of money because we're all in our early twenties. \n\nAITA? \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1694922110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kql1r/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_the_money_for_an_evenly/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If everyone only paid their own bill, they wouldn't get half as much food and drinks as they got. Its just taking advantage of the people who don't order much or drink.", "I can understand splitting the bill evenly if it\u2019s 10-20% difference here and there but that is a huge difference. No way I\u2019d feel comfortable splitting a bill evenly if i downed 5+ cocktails (which is insane in and of itself) and others had 0-1. Your friends are jerks. NTA.", "NTA.  It\u2019s one thing to split the bill when everything is shared or everyone is having similar money spent on things.  It\u2019s taking advantage of the non-drinker to split a tab that includes numerous drinks for others.  I\u2019m a non drinker for medical reasons, and when going out with friends, we either got the bar tab separated from the food (and divided the food bill evenly) or we did the math and figured out what we each owe.  If people say it\u2019s too much work, there\u2019s an easy fix: tell them it\u2019s no problem, you\u2019ll do the math, do they want to divide the drinks cost evenly between the drinkers or should you just itemize everything?  Whip out your phone and use that calculator.\n\nIt\u2019s doubly rude to make you pay for their drinks and use you as their designated driver.  If my friends are drinking enough to need a designated driver, they usually divide the cost of the DD\u2019s meal between them, because it\u2019s cheaper than cabs/Ubers and a thank-you for choosing not to drink and do the extra driving to get everyone home.\n\nBefore you go out with these friends again, you need to clarify your position that you can\u2019t afford to pay for their drinking, so if you\u2019re splitting the tab, the drinks need to be on a separate tab that is only divided among the drinkers.  If you tell the server before anything gets ordered, either you not being on the main tab or the drinks and food being separate tabs are things most places can do, so it doesn\u2019t even take any extra math to figure out your share.", "NTA. Those friends are taking advantage of the situation. Its abusive if the consumption is so uneven.", "NTA\n\nThey're taking advantage of you. If you're not drinking and barely eating you shouldn't have to pay for their drinks. From now on, get your own check.", "NTA But stop going out with these people. You know how they behave and you keep thinking they will change? They won\u2019t!", "You\u2019re not the asshole but you\u2019re kinda an idiot for letting this happen to you more than once. Stop going out with these so called friends.", "NTA, they\u2019re not real friends", "NTA. \n\nJust have a separate bill. Around here, that's the norm. Everyone pays for the food and drink they had.", "ESH\n\n>In my head because we had a lot of shared dishes so I was already resigned to having to pay at least like maybe $50-60 to cover the food even though what I ate (I double checked the menu for this) only amounted to a little over $25. \n\nNot paying for drinks? Fair.  But, don't play this game where you're prorating how much you owe based on what you actually ate.  You've been unemployed for five months, if you can't afford to go out, don't go out to the \"pricey Asian fusion restaurant\" with a bunch of big spenders.", "This has happened before so you should had been more prepared this time. You know the saying: fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Why do you keep going out with these leeches ? It would be cheaper for you to order takeaway than eating with these people. \n\nThere is always a reason why people want to split the bill evenly and it\u2019s not a good one. They know a person or two order way less than them and that\u2019s why they want to split the bill evenly so THEY can save money. Stop going out with them.", "NTA... but it's time to stop going out with these people. \n\nIf you can't avoid that, tell the server up front \"I'm paying for what I have and a tip and that's it. The split, etc. is all on them,\" and have your small meal and soft drink or whatever. You've been suckered into paying for far more than you've enjoyed *twice* now in one way or another and your friends don't seem to get that you starve for a week when they decide to \"evenly split\" on stuff you didn't/can't enjoy.", "NTA. But you have to set the precedent from the onset. Refusal to pay after the fact gets difficult.\n\nI've gotten shafted SO MANY times due to heavy alcohol consumption by others - I don't drink. \n\nI promised myself about the future state, I'll proactively tell wait staff that I'll do a separate check. But it's never happened once and I end up grumbling to myself on the drive home. \n\nBut that's my own fault for not speaking up even though it's happened on numerous occasions. Culturally, it's difficult to go against the grain and get a separate tab.", "Nta", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter how much of the shared items you consumed, that\u2019s not how costs are split when ordering food out meant to be shared- you aren\u2019t ordering 10 chicken nuggets and splitting based on the cost of each nugget (or in your case, each grain of rice). Your explanation about how much you consumed of each dish is a little ridiculous, unnecessary and honestly the majority of people cannot stand individuals who do this. You went out to eat and agreed to share food. The other individuals could and probably should have exempted your portion from paying for alcohol at all but honestly if you\u2019ve been unemployed for 5 months\u2026 why are you doing any of this? Why are you going to pricey restaurant with shared plates? Why did you wait till the end to discuss this with intoxicated individuals? \n\nIf you had an issue with however the check would be split, you should have explained that to your friends from the beginning. Your friends are not responsible, nor do they know anything about your finances. Being unemployed doesn\u2019t automatically mean you cannot afford to fund the activities you\u2019re choosing to partake in.", "Why are you spending money on luxuries that you don't need just want.\n\nYou're broke YTA", "ESH I don't think you should have split the drinks evenly, because they ordered those. But if everyone ordered food for the table, it does make sense to split those. I get your reasoning that you didn't eat as much food as the others, but the food was still ordered. Like, if everyone just had a few pieces of pork and some rice and most of the food went uneaten, the food would still have to be paid for.", "Two words, dude. Separate checks. \n\nYTA for not making this clear, right from the beginning.", "YTA! Pay the bill, you shared just like everyone else", "So let me get this straight you know your friends are heavy drinkers and already had a problem where you had to pay 150$ on a shared bill and you STILL shared the bill at a expensive restaurant even though you\u2019re unemployed ? I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re asking to be taken advantage of at this point.\n\nHonestly you should pay back the 200$ and next time DON\u2019T SHARE THE BILL and ask for a separate bill", "> I go to the bathroom and upon returning\n\n\nYTA. You chose not to be part of the conversation and then had a problem with the result. \n\n\nThis sutuation is really easy to mitigate in the future. Let the server know you are on a seperate tab. If they say the party is too large for separate checks, order from the bar or make it 100% clear to everyone else you are on a budget.\n\n\nBy the way, thanks for providing a scenario worthy of AITA. You made a social faux pas and can do better next time.", "NTA. But you need to insist on your own bill next time.", "NTA, order separately from now on and make sure the waiter knows you're not on their tab.", "I mean you should have learned the last time. Ask for a separate bill and stop splitting food. If you are on a budget order what you can afford.", "NTA. Ask for a separate check when you order and get your own food. These people want yo to subsidize their drinking. Everybody didn't agree to an even split. You weren't thete when they decided.", "No. Always state up front that you want a separate bill. I'm shocked at the number of people who run up their tabs and expect their friends to subsidize their meals.", "NTA and you need better friends.", "NTA. They\u2019re using you. If you go out with them, when you order tell the server/restaurant you will have a separate check. And they can split their portions.", "NTA, my mom and I used to go out to eat with her sister and niece a few times a year.  They always order to the max and wanted to split the bill four ways, we never allowed it, they got mad, and they would scream at us in the parking lot because we were \"rich\", and they were \"poor\" and we owed it to them.", "Info, there argument is that it's too much of a hassle, yet you've already done your own maths and now how much you spent. Why can't you put that in a message and put your foot down. \n\nGuts I have calculated my bill, which is XYZ, I didn't have multiple cocktails/drinks like the rest of you and from here on out I'm only paying for the portion that I eat \n\nThey are taking advantage of you.", "Your employment status, who drank what, how much you ate, what color the sky is, none of that matters in the slightest. Did you agree to to split the bill or not?", "Why the f**k do people keep doing this ?  \nSay at the beginning of the night \u2018I\u2019m only paying for my own\u2019  \nDon\u2019t leave until the bill has been tallied and then say it.  \nYou\u2019re all adults freakin communicate", "Hell no, your friends are assholes thinking a non-drinker should be covering their 10 drinks apiece. \n\nI would decline to go out with them, that's ridiculous.

If you made a big enough fuss, they won\u2019t invite you again. But truthfully I think you shouldn\u2019t have accepted the invitation since you don\u2019t have disposable cash right now", "NTA. These are NOT your friends. Friends would never force an unemployed friend to pay for their expensive drinks.", "NTA. You need new friends.", "NTA. It's no *that* hard to work out the split of the food separately from the alcohol.\nAs they were sharing dishes It's reasonable to pay an equal share of the food element of the bill, and of the portion of the tip for that. Send 1/6 of the food bill and make clear you are not willing to pay for everyone else's drinks.\n(Another's time, maybe suggest that the drinks go on  a separate tab, or offer to be the one who works our the split as you are sober and theh aren't", "NTA\n\nThe fact your so-called friends know your situation yet still refused to pay their own way on the basis of \"hassle\" should be evidence enough that they're not good specimens to begin with. I'd reassess the type of people you associate with.", "NTA.  Exactly.  Tell the server at the start to keep your bill separate.", "Ditto, why pay for other's excess?  As the OP has been out of work, I am sure money is very tight for them, and this is a treat for them.  The friends on the other hand are not treating this as anything special and they seem to think they can pawn the bill on somebody else it seems.\n\nOP good for you on setting boundaries!-NTA", "If you weren't a teenager you would realize that most establishments won't take seperate bills for parties over a certain size, typically six.", "and if the restaurant wont separate, bring cash, ask to pay for yours and put the cash down and they can split the remainder.", "Right. It literally isn\u2019t hard. What kind of assholes sit there all night ordering more food and drink and expect someone else to pay for it?", "Shared dishes, which this sounds to be, also makes sense to me, but the individual drinks should be on the individual not the group. Especially for some of those heavy drinkers.", "I was looking for this comment! \n\nMy friends and I go out often and usually split a few appetizers or we\u2019ll each get a meal and share everything. We normally also drink pretty much the same amount. So because we all get the same amount of things (roughly) we usually just split the bill evenly. The last time we went out, I was planning on the even split like we normally do, but my friend with the tab stopped us and split it up with one portion missing the price of liquor for the night, because I\u2019m pregnant and not drinking. It was a nice gesture, but again, not expected. \n\nI get OP doesn\u2019t drink at all, so this should be a normal thing for them. In terms of the food, either order your own separate dish, or split the cost evenly. Like, if someone seriously said to me \u201cwell, I only ate a fifth of a portion of our pasta, and a quarter of the appetizer, and I double checked the menu and broke down the cost, so I\u2019m only going to pay for that,\u201d I would accept and then never invite them out again. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re low on money, but don\u2019t be fine with \u201csharing\u201d food knowing you can\u2019t afford to and then pinch your pennies when the check hits the table. Just say \u201cI\u2019m going to order this specific item for just myself and I don\u2019t want to share it, so order for yourselves & don\u2019t include me.\u201d And after that, ask your server to start a separate tab for just you. It\u2019s soooo not complicated. And then you don\u2019t need to worry about anything else, the others can split evenly if they want.", "While that\u2019s a common reason to split the bill evenly, it\u2019s not the only one.  I used to go to big events where a lot of us would go out for food afterwards, and if the food was all priced about the same, we\u2019d split the tab evenly because it was easier for the waitstaff, and we recognized that a big group like ours was a lot of work (we also tended to tip about 30%, and were friendly and patient with them, because enough of us had worked food that the group understood how hard a huge group was).  Also did it a lot with my gaming group in college, because we were sharing all the takeout and not ordering drinks.  It only makes sense when everyone is going to be spending a similar amount.  When there\u2019s uneven spending, it\u2019s usually the expensive jerk pawning their costs off on everyone else.", "These people were ordering more and more stuff and devouring it while the OP was finished eating, and did you not see the bit about the 10 alcoholic drinks apiece while the OP only had one non-alcoholic drink? I like to drink too but I wouldn't dream of expecting a non-drinker to pay for my multiple pricey cocktails while they had tea.", "> on luxuries that you don't need just want.\n\nBecause otherwise they wouldn't be luxuries? *headtap.gif*", ">Why are you spending money on luxuries that you don't need just want.\n\nEven broke people need a break from the monotony of sitting at home alone eating ramen noodles. The counselling required to break the depression resulting in isolation would likely cost more than the $25 this meal SHOULD have cost the OP.", "It appears that the OP did not. Did you read the post? The group decided to split the check afterwards, while OP was in the bathroom. OP refused. That does not sound like agreeing to split the bill. \n\nThe only time it's appropriate to split evenly is if everyone had roughly the same stuff. Not \"I had 10 drinks and you didn't have any, let's split it evenly.\"", "Might be like that where you live. \n\nIn Germany, it's common to have separate bills, even for huge parties. And if someone wants to pay for everyone to make things easier, everyone gives that person the money for exactly their drinks and food. \nPaying an evenly split bill, no matter who had how much, is absolutely not normal here.", ">If you weren't a teenager you would realize that most establishments won't take seperate bills for parties over a certain size, typically six.\n\nIt's usually best not to assume practices are the same everywhere as where you happen to live. I have never had any issue getting a separate check no matter the size of the party.", "I am sure the server's are used to this anyway.  Besides they would have to wait another minute or 2 for the bill to be spit."]}
