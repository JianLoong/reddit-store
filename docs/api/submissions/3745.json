But it's very hard to not react to someone talking smack ABOUT you so you can hear but aren't supposed to defend yourself.  She sounds upset that you had seniority over her at this past job, and she's resentful.  I don't understand how it is that it's okay for her to neglect customers, yell about you, yet people take her side.\n\nWhat is going on at that place?!\n\nCongratulations on your promotion and I hope you'll be a lot more appreciated there.  And I hope that on her own at that branch, your ex-coworker's incompetence and attitude will become apparent to others.", "N T A for having emotions, but YTA for yelling at work and contributing to the scene your coworker was making. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. If you\u2019re trying to go for leadership roles at work, being the person that replies in anger and then runs off to the bathroom to have a panic attack and then stays home for a bunch of days because \u201cI can\u2019t even deal with you right now\u201d is not going to inspire confidence in your abilities to lead. Forget about your coworker for a minute - would YOU promote someone who reacted the way you did? If you were the branch manager (or owner), would you promote into leadership someone who loses her temper, lashes out, and then disappears while on the clock, in front of all the customers?\nFrom your account, sounds like your coworker just doesn\u2019t like feeling like she owes you a favor, especially since she\u2019s used to being the one in a position of authority and here she\u2019s not.  But also, you need to find a way to be able to process your emotions without having a panic attack.
