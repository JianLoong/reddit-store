But it's very hard to not react to someone talking smack ABOUT you so you can hear but aren't supposed to defend yourself.  She sounds upset that you had seniority over her at this past job, and she's resentful.  I don't understand how it is that it's okay for her to neglect customers, yell about you, yet people take her side.\n\nWhat is going on at that place?!\n\nCongratulations on your promotion and I hope you'll be a lot more appreciated there.  And I hope that on her own at that branch, your ex-coworker's incompetence and attitude will become apparent to others.", "N T A for having emotions, but YTA for yelling at work and contributing to the scene your coworker was making. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. If you\u2019re trying to go for leadership roles at work, being the person that replies in anger and then runs off to the bathroom to have a panic attack and then stays home for a bunch of days because \u201cI can\u2019t even deal with you right now\u201d is not going to inspire confidence in your abilities to lead. Forget about your coworker for a minute - would YOU promote someone who reacted the way you did? If you were the branch manager (or owner), would you promote into leadership someone who loses her temper, lashes out, and then disappears while on the clock, in front of all the customers?\nFrom your account, sounds like your coworker just doesn\u2019t like feeling like she owes you a favor, especially since she\u2019s used to being the one in a position of authority and here she\u2019s not.  But also, you need to find a way to be able to process your emotions without having a panic attack. Please seek therapy.", "NTA", "I already set up a meeting with my branch manager and our HR team for next week, Thank you for your kind words <3", "nTA and don't take her shit anymore!", "NTA but gotta learn to keep your cool if you want to move up in a company. As a office manager I had an employee who BS\u2019d her way into the job as my assistant to me and the owner of the company. She came off very capable and professional but it became apparent very quickly that she was completely incompetent and very very unprofessional like showing up to casual Friday in a camo hoodie and sweatpants and having to be sent home unprofessional. In our line of work confidentiality was key and having the people who worked for us and our clients we serviced needed to have trust in us but she treated them all like they were beneath her and never stopped talking about previous jobs that were also bound by confidentiality. I had more then one meeting with her about her behaviour and I had been documenting everything that was not ok, but nothing seemed to approve so I had to bring in the owner and have a team meeting where when she was confronted with all documentation she blew up and I mean lost it where she had to be removed from the building because she had her fist up to hit me but I kept my calm and let her sink herself. She also proved in that meeting that she had been snooping through my office and computer when I was out and had snooped in the documentation before our meeting and was riled and ready to fight.", ">She went into an office with a loans officer and just starting yelling. \n\n\n>watching her yell at me and degrade me \n\n\nOp:\n> I said \"why do you think I applied for that other job I don't want to work with you anymore I hate it here\"\n\nGod forbid people say anything at all while being humiliated", "NTA. But calling in sick could jeopardize your promotion. You said you're already short staffed.", "Are you her boss? Because if not you shouldn\u2019t be asking her to do things or correct her work. You don\u2019t get paid for managing people unless you do. I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s not a good idea to not show up for work. It\u2019s unprofessional and awkward.", "NTA - but you are or are becoming the office scapegoat. It's a good thing you're getting transferred soon, because this doesn't get better.\n\nA suggestion from a previous office scapegoat: work hard on establishing your boundaries from the beginning at your next position. I'd check out some online videos about dealing with difficult people and gaslighters. Because her accusing you of doing nothing when it's demonstrably false is gaslighting. It's meant to discombobulate you and leave you confused and angry. She wanted that reaction from you, because then she can play the victim some more. When you transfer, as the new person you will be vulnerable to becoming a target again, so work on those tools now.\n\nAnd this isn't personal. People like this aren't able to process their own shortcomings so they project them onto others. When you leave she'll find a new scapegoat.", "NTA please report everything to HR ASAP.", "OP, good luck with the meeting! I agree that getting this on record from your perspective is great, but also want to caution you that HR protects your employer. I would try to phrase everything I say in terms of your coworker\u2019s actions making the work environment hostile, their actions make it difficult for you to complete your work, you actively are trying to remove yourself from the situation by transferring branches\u2026 it\u2019s terrible but you want to make sure that coworker isn\u2019t playing the corporate game \u201cbetter\u201d than you"]}
