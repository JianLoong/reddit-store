But if green bean casserole was listed, that was one less thing for them to prep. \n\nAlso, in my experience, guests typically arrive at the location well before it\u2019s time to eat, and can bring a dish that\u2019s prepped but not cooked.

That's time and money in itself. Time IS money!\n\nThen they have to deal with people breaking stuff, stains on the carpet like its not a big deal, people not able to handle alcohol, peer mediator, screaming babies, available to everyone at the same gosh dag time like  be in 4 diff places at once, everyone calling your name, be it friend, family or children, but act like not a thing is wrong!!!!!!

I don't  provide drinks outside of water! Everyone must contribute and share! Even paper plates, forks and napkins people bring. It's just simple. \n\nI think that per what I read in the OP, the host part is being taken for granted. It is actually a lot of work and prep and after effect! I've  hosted my fair share!\n\nIf you don't  want to contribute  then yeah don't go, that is your choice! But to show up empty handed, yeah YWBTA", "YWBTA to bring nothing.

Everyone brings a main dish or a couple of side dishes. That's just how pot lucks work. It's not the host's job to provide all the main dishes, but they can if they want. It's a group effort and that way, everyone contributes equally to the meal. The host is also responsible for the majority of the cleanup. Have you even thought about that?? Cleanup is a pain in the ass, especially after a big Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nIf you go to a pot luck without bringing any food, then you don't deserve to eat anything.  Idk how things work in non-Asian families, but in an Asian pot luck, everyone is expected to contribute nearly equally. Of course, the host will be expected to provide more than others, but not by much. Afterall, they are providing their home for the event, and they're responsible for the majority of the cleanup afterwards.\n\nI host bbq pot lucks all the time with my friends, but I provide just the veggies.

Shoot, when we visited my wife\u2019s mom for the first time I even cooked a dish so I could contribute something.\n\nI genuinely feel you don\u2019t like your DIL and are using this as an excuse to lash out at her and feel validated.\n\nYTA", "Nta.

Even if son and DIL are well to do, doesn't mean that they can afford to go all out.\n\nI will admit that I probably would have offered to do the main, rather than drinks, in their position, but it's my opinion.\n\nThe other question to consider is how DIL does thanksgiving.

My husband\u2019s aunt was always assigned that as she was a terrible cook and they figured she couldn\u2019t mess it up (spoiler\u2026she could and did).

There\u2019s no law that says you have to go. But if you *do* decide to go, be sure to sign up to take a side dish. *ONE* side dish. Something slightly more involved than buying a pie or a can of cranberry sauce \u2014 make sure it\u2019s something that *you* would eat. And if no one signs up for turkey, say nothing. And don\u2019t volunteer to do it. But then make sure you eat before you go! Let the host look foolish on her own. And act like nothing is off or wrong.

You're not the only one being asked to bring food, so it's not like the onus is solely on you. It's really petty to refuse to bring food, imo. \n\nGrowing up, we always had large Thanksgivings that were set up like this. My grandmas would host, the uncles would grab some beer and sit around a vat while the turkey was deep-frying, one of my grandmas would make pies, aunts and cousins would bring side dishes, and we usually brought a pie, rolls, and drinks. My sister and her boyfriend would always volunteer to do dishes and clean up after. It's a sense of community and intimacy; something good family gatherings need.", "NTA \n\nCan you sign up for ice? Like literally bags of ice. You know, gotta keep the drinks cold. \n\nOr maybe butter. For the rolls. Get the nice Kerry gold one so you don\u2019t look cheap. The garlic herb version is good on rolls.\n\nMaybe soda. You can bring a bunch of 2 liters - just buy them on sale and you\u2019ll save a ton.\n\nCool whip & whipped cream. To top off the desserts.\n\nThey didn\u2019t say it had to be actual dishes lol.", "NTA.

The response is absolutely perfect.\n\nShow up with the rolls and a pie or the rolls and an appetizer. \n\nWe do potluck Thanksgivings every year. Our family is too large for one person to do all the food prep so the host makes the Turkey and the rest of us pitch in with a couple of sides. We have quite the spread that way... its awesome!", "If someone has already claimed rolls, sign up for the butter. Not even a dish, just a condiment.", "Hawaiian King Rolls if you want to splurge. Cheapskates!", "NTA. I think she should bring a side or dessert. Unless the SIL pressures someone they won\u2019t be bringing a turkey.  Drinks only from the host?

Can you imagine the hassle of hauling a whole turkey to someone else's house? I can just see having to hit the brakes and greasy turkey juices ending up all over the backseat, if not worse.", ".... And the gravy. And the potatoes.\nTbh a lot of that meal doesn't travel well.", "It could just be that they have the biggest dining room and want to provide the space or whatever. In my family, if we were doing a party potluck style the host would always do the main dish and a couple of main sides, but maybe somebody already insisted on making the turkey or whatever. We don't know what is going on behind the scenes.", "Have you ever hosted a big family event? Even if you don\u2019t provide food it is still a lot of work.

Bizarre.", "Many families that I know do", "I\u2019d be more concerned  about traipsing an hour or more trying to keep a turkey safe to eat.

My MIL does it every year and she\u2019s stuck washing dishes for hours.

But much more longwinded \ud83e\udd23", "This, it didn't sound that weird to me too.

We had to split the cost of the food amongst him, me, and his siblings while his mom cooked everything, yet ALLLLLLLLLLL the extended family (who lived less than 10 min away) always came and ate & drank for free. Always left me bitter every damn year. Probably because in my culture, it\u2019s extremely rude and disrespectful to go to someone\u2019s home empty handed.", "Potluck thanksgivings are the best!  When my in laws host thanksgiving I always want to bring something over, because we have different dishes that are our favorites, and I feel like if my MIL makes the whole thing the dishes that I like best get neglected.

We better bring some extra cups.\"). One family brings one type of veggies, one brings a different type of veggies, one guy brings loads of ice, one person cooks the turkey, one person brings an alternate meat, one brings yeast bread, one brings corn bread, one brings huge flats of dressing, one brings cake, one brings pie, one brings drinks, etc. The feast is kind of ridiculous in scope.\n\nIf you leave our holiday events hungry, you simply weren't trying.", "Or cranberry sauce", "I love the idea of bringing the butter, just one stick of butter \ud83d\ude06 Petty AF but hilariously so.", "If OP didn't jump on that list the moment is was up, all the simple side dishes and condiments will be gone by now.", "Potatoes do okay. My brother usually brings those to my house. And I could put slightly cooled gravy in a Tupperware if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that turkey and gravy are inextricably linked. But the turkey? The turkey needs to be cooked at the house where you eat. We are renting out a big room for our family celebration this year, but there\u2019s no kitchen we can use. I\u2019m low key concerned about transporting the Turkey for 5 minutes after we cook it. No way would I schlep it across town while the hosts brought drinks.", "It sounds as if the invite went out with no one knowing what anyone else was bringing and the hosts opted to sign up for only drinks before anyone else could. \n\nPersonally I love hosting but I know that means I provide the bulk of the dishes. The only time someone else has brought a turkey or ham is when I\u2019m also cooking a turkey. Yeah we have a big family so many years two turkeys were needed.", "Let's say someone insisted on making the main dish I see no issue in that. But to say you're hosting Thanksgiving and you sign up for drinks, the one item that you don't have to make. It kinda sounds like 'we don't feel like cooking or going out so let's have people bring food here'.", "Then they should never volunteer to host, if you can't even handle that and a main dish. Sounds like the invite to their house was a surprise and not discussed, so there may be someone else willing to take on the traditional host duties (including making a turkey).", "Then don\u2019t offer to host. Cleaning your house is not your gift to your guests. It\u2019s part of being an adult.", "My main point was they chose the one thing that they don't have to make. They are basically just having all their family over to bring over food so they can have a thanksgiving. \n\nI'm not even one of those people saying they have to make the main dish. But at least make something and contribute.", "Yes indeed, speaking as the host of hundreds of family barbecues. Ugh, does no one ever make their own cup of coffee  : )", "This. I hate hosting, and have limits on how often I'll get voluntold. It's always overnight stays for me, which is 10000x worse.", "Do all the dishes?

The hosts don't get to autocratically decide that without consulting anyone else.", "We do a pretty potluck-y thanksgiving in my family. Someone brings the potatoes, someone else the rolls, a third person brings the yams, a fourth does the pies, etc. All that is left for the host is turkey and gravy unless they want to make more. But A-we all live within short drives of each other. B-this has been the way of things for decades. No one has benefited from someone else hosting for years and then slacked off as a host themselves. And C-even in my potluck thanksgiving, the host does the turkey! Cause trying to transport a Turkey across town is insane!", "Yep.\n\nAlso, I think the sides are almost always better than the turkey.

It was meatballs, green bean casserole, a turnkey breast and some other odds and ends. \n\nEveryone just picked something and brought it.\n\nIf anything you people get way bent out of shape for a holiday thats a lie to begin with.", "Well the easiest choice is to say sorry I'm busy and not make a scene.", "Also a bit of a risk of having no main dish at all if everyone else is opting to bring sides/desserts!\n\nI think OP is being a bit overdramatic but I can see this dinner not going as planned by the hosts.", "Open communication is key in family dynamics, and expressing your concerns to your son and DIL might help improve the situation and lead to a more agreeable Thanksgiving arrangement. It's important to prioritize your own comfort and boundaries while also maintaining family relationships.", "I'm sure the host will provide food.

It is not required that you also provide all the food.", "Every family is different. If this woman won\u2019t even bring a dish I doubt she will help clean up. My point is just that hosting can be taxing even without providing food and if that is how this family is choosing to do so that she should respect it.", "I meant things like everyone has a glass, ice, condiments, plates, cutlery, knows where the bathroom and trash is, if someone spills you need to wipe it up, kids are being looked after. There is a lot going on when you have a house full of people. Also unless they are eating on paper plates there will still be dishes.

Totally okay to have a potluck, but that decision should be made by family. If extended family regularly gets together for a holiday, they should plan how things are going to get done. You don't get to unilaterally decide you're going to host but not provide any food.  \nMy extended family always used to have giant Thanksgiving meals at my parents' house: parents and siblings and spouses, my grandparents (both sides), my dad's sisters and spouses, my aunts' in-laws\\*, all the first cousins, the next generation of kids, and family friends. We'd regularly be 30-35 people at dinner (and my mom actually loved hosting, btw). \n\nMy mom would do the turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, steamed broccoli and cheese sauce; my dad's mom would do the pies, Aunt D would do the rolls, the green beans, and a cake, Aunt B would make the cranberry salad and a ham, Aunt C would make a tossed salad (she had the farthest to drive, about 4 hours), my mom's mom would make her weird orange jello salad and deviled eggs and open three jars of homemade pickles... the sweet potatoes were always up for grabs and it just depended on which person made them which recipe we'd get.\n\nIt was always a fabulous meal and everybody got along. (I mean, the women cooked and cleaned and the men basically watched football on TV, so maybe not perfect, but still. We were happy to be together.)\n\n\\*My dad and his three sisters allllll married only children, so their spouses' parents were always invited.", "Maybe but maybe not. I know people that will stick to exactly what they say. If they say only drinks and nobody opts to make whatever main dish, guess what, it\u2019s not being made. And I know people who would do exactly this-only drinks!", "Just bring the can! Not even opened or in a dish", "Not ALL the food but the main dish,  certainly! I have never heard of someone \"hosting\" Thanksgiving yet doing absolutely NONE of the cooking. Not to mention, who on earth wants to haul an entire big greasy turkey to someone else's house? That sounds like a disaster just waiting to happen. Plus you don't always know when it will be done so you can't even guarantee what time you'll be arriving, it will be cold, etc... It just isn't a reasonable request in any way.", "It's not just \"bring a dish\" it's bring the \"main\" dish you know, the turkey that needs to cook for HOURS. So no matter what they get COLD turkey.", "I agree it\u2019s odd but not AH territory especially if someone else volunteered. I personally suck at cooking a turkey it always turns out too dry so if someone offered to bring one I would be ecstatic. Also the hosts are providing beverages which if that includes alcohol can be very expensive. It\u2019s not cooking but it is a contribution.", "I agree the host wouldn't be an AH if someone volunteered randomly but ASKING someone else to bring the turkey makes them the AH. It would make much more sense for them to order the turkey from a grocery store or restaurant  precooked and sliced if they aren't good cooks and ask guests to BYOB."]}
