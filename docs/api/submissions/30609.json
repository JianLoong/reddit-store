But if green bean casserole was listed, that was one less thing for them to prep. \n\nAlso, in my experience, guests typically arrive at the location well before it\u2019s time to eat, and can bring a dish that\u2019s prepped but not cooked.

You definitely don't have to show up with a turkey!\n\nIf I were you I'd probably just volunteer to bring a side or a dessert and go.

That's time and money in itself. Time IS money!\n\nThen they have to deal with people breaking stuff, stains on the carpet like its not a big deal, people not able to handle alcohol, peer mediator, screaming babies, available to everyone at the same gosh dag time like  be in 4 diff places at once, everyone calling your name, be it friend, family or children, but act like not a thing is wrong!!!!!! But you feel like a chicken with its head cut off all nite long and before and after!!!!! I could go on.... Then you need oqnly to have to clean up after everyone afterwards! Omg lets not even talk about the clean up!!! And lets not forget being the gracious hostess in between! And fixing everyomes problems during the stay.\n\nThey are providing drinks..

I don't  provide drinks outside of water! Everyone must contribute and share! Even paper plates, forks and napkins people bring. It's just simple. \n\nI think that per what I read in the OP, the host part is being taken for granted. It is actually a lot of work and prep and after effect! I've  hosted my fair share!\n\nIf you don't  want to contribute  then yeah don't go, that is your choice! But to show up empty handed, yeah YWBTA", "YWBTA to bring nothing.

Everyone brings a main dish or a couple of side dishes. That's just how pot lucks work. It's not the host's job to provide all the main dishes, but they can if they want. It's a group effort and that way, everyone contributes equally to the meal. The host is also responsible for the majority of the cleanup. Have you even thought about that?? Cleanup is a pain in the ass, especially after a big Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nIf you go to a pot luck without bringing any food, then you don't deserve to eat anything.  Idk how things work in non-Asian families, but in an Asian pot luck, everyone is expected to contribute nearly equally. Of course, the host will be expected to provide more than others, but not by much. Afterall, they are providing their home for the event, and they're responsible for the majority of the cleanup afterwards.\n\nI host bbq pot lucks all the time with my friends, but I provide just the veggies.

I am sure there is a nice HungryMan frozen turkey dinner you\u2019ll enjoy.", "YTA- are you seriously complaining about bringing food to thanksgiving.

Shoot, when we visited my wife\u2019s mom for the first time I even cooked a dish so I could contribute something.\n\nI genuinely feel you don\u2019t like your DIL and are using this as an excuse to lash out at her and feel validated.\n\nYTA", "Nta.

Even if son and DIL are well to do, doesn't mean that they can afford to go all out.\n\nI will admit that I probably would have offered to do the main, rather than drinks, in their position, but it's my opinion.\n\nThe other question to consider is how DIL does thanksgiving.

Whoever was hosting made all the sides, desserts,etc. the other made the turkey.   \n\n\nI\u2019d collude with the others\u2026someone brings rolls, another butter, yet another rings a can of cranberry sauce. You can have some serious fun. Salt & pepper, a tray of Bob Evans microwaveable potatoes. How about a relish try? My husband\u2019s aunt was always assigned that as she was a terrible cook and they figured she couldn\u2019t mess it up (spoiler\u2026she could and did).

There\u2019s no law that says you have to go. But if you *do* decide to go, be sure to sign up to take a side dish. *ONE* side dish. Something slightly more involved than buying a pie or a can of cranberry sauce \u2014 make sure it\u2019s something that *you* would eat. And if no one signs up for turkey, say nothing. And don\u2019t volunteer to do it. But then make sure you eat before you go! Let the host look foolish on her own. And act like nothing is off or wrong.
