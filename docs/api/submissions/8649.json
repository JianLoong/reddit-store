It was divorce papers he'd seen in our dads car. I told him straight up it wasn't any of our business, made him delete the photo, and made him promise not to tell our parents.\n\nThat lasted all our two weeks. He told our mother because he \"couldn't handle keeping the secret\" even though the school has counselors and stuff for him to talk to. Lot's of drama, my mother ended up being the one to divorce him, and from what I understand got the better deal. \n\nOur father isn't taking this well. He moved into a shittier appartment than the one I share, and he's been really depressed lately. He also started to get really distant with my brother, they've only spoken 2 or 3 times since hell broke loose, and even then it was mostly just school related. I've been cold too, since it's either that or being pissed off at him. I warned him to stay out of someone else's marriage, and this is why.\n\nHe called me christmas day, sobbing that dad wasn't answering his calls, and that he felt like a horrible son. I was out of empathy for him, so I let loose \"I warned you to mind your own business. I wouldn't talk to you if you ruined my marriage either. You better hope he's the bigger man and forgives you, because I wouldn't\" \n\nHe hasn't called me since, mom called me and is worried about him, she says he needs his sister. But I really don't care, which is why I'm wondering if I'm being reasonable here.", "created_utc": 1675047254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10oqqk6/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_has_nobody_to/", "score": 1981, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "Are you really blaming your brother for your parent's divorce?? He literally saw the divorce papers. Your parents were gonna divorce anyway. Your dad is depressed because he did'nt get a better deal out of the divorce. Your brother is 16!! How the hell do u expect him to handle the situation? Instead of telling him to \"mind his own business\" you should've explained the situation to him OR been an emotional support to him.\n\nYTA. I cannot believe you wrote all that and still thought you're not an asshole.", "Honestly the fact that you and your dad are taking this out on him makes you both TA. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "Oh your dad's plan to blindside your mom failed and now instead of manning up and taking responsibility for his actions hes being an AH to his own son?\n\nYTA", "YTA. He\u2019s a child and his father has basically abandoned him. They were getting divorced anyway. Your brother telling your mother about the divorce papers didn\u2019t precipitate that. Why are you blaming him for the divorce when it\u2019s entirely your parents\u2019 faults?", "YTA I don't think \"stay out of it\" is particularly good advice. Keeping the secret was also picking a side. In all likelihood, the dad got screwed in the divorce because that's often what happens. The money doesn't go around. \n\nIf anyone is the AH here, it's the dad for failing to lock his shit down.", "How do you figure your brother ruined their marriage?\n\nOne of your parents already had divorce papers drawn up, the other beat him to the punch and it's antagonistic enough that you're talking about who got 'the better deal'. Besides which, you weren't surprised they got divorced. \n\nSounds like your brother had no real bearing on their divorce so why are you blaming him for it?\n\nSeems like you're taking out your own feelings about a messy situation on your brother. Who is evidently struggling, and hasn't done anything except be honest. \n\nYTA", "YTA, but at least we know you got it from your dad.", "YTA. Wow. Are you really that angry over your mom \"getting a better deal\" on something your father was trying to pull? \n\nYour father is depressed and isn't dealing well with something HE WANTED? Look. Your brother told your mother because he felt he had to. And he was right. You are both punishing him for not letting your mother be blindsided here.\n\nI hope only the best for your brother and that he is able to let go of toxic people who thought he should have let his mother be served divorce papers without even knowing it was coming.", "Ummm, he\u2019s friggin 16.  I guess you forgot what that\u2019s like.  What a huge burden that is for him to absorb.  The only person you and your dad should be mad at is your dad.  Who the treats someone they love like that?!\n\nYTA and so is your dad. Shame on both of you.  \n\nI hope your brother is okay,", "Wow, I feel so sorry for the brother. Sounds like he saw something that was left in plain sight - not that he was snooping - and it was devastating to him. He didn\u2019t know what to do and when he went to look for support, he got told to shut up, essentially. Then he had to live with the knowledge that his mom might be blindsided, decided he couldn\u2019t, tried to do what felt morally right, and is now being punished for it. \n\nYTA, op. Show a little compassion.", "YTA. I\u2019d like to know the alternative. What would\u2019ve happened to your mom if she didn\u2019t know? All your brother didn\u2019t was give your mom the same \u201cadvantage\u201d your dad had. Especially if he was trying to blindside her. But aside from all that, he\u2019s 16. I\u2019m assuming by your fathers petty behavior and reaction to all this that your brother is closer to your mom so I can totally understand why he wouldn\u2019t want to keep a secret from her. This wasn\u2019t a personal struggle to talk out with a counselor, it was a secret he felt keeping meant lying to his mom. Not to mention no support from his older sister. Maybe you should speak to a counselor", "YTA big time. It sounds like you blame your brother for \u201cruining someone\u2019s marriage\u201d but your dad ALREADY HAD DIVORCE PAPERS. It\u2019s not like your brother ruined a good surprise- he was just giving your mom a heads up so she wasn\u2019t blind sided. Your dad wanted to divorce your mom, and was careless enough to leave the papers lying around. Why are you more mad at your brother (a child) than your dad?", "YTA. How did he ruin their marriage if your dad already had divorce papers? You make no sense.", "YTA. \n\nYou want someone to blame for the divorce. Newsflash: it\u2019s NOT YOUR BROTHER\u2019S FAULT. Do you think your father had the papers in the first place because of your brother? You think your mother divorced your father because she found out?

Your dad was going to blind sight your mom into a divorce, why would you want that for her?", "YTA. Secret keeping and placating one parent's emotions over another leads to a lifetime of anxiety, stress and relationship problems. He did the right thing. Hiding it was never an option.", "YTA Look, whatever he did, he's struggling with an incredibly hard situation. Stay out of it? How does he do that when he loves your mom and your dad? How do either of you walk around knowing your dad is going to divorce her while she walks around blissfully unaware only to get hit with it out of the blue?  If you love her, you have to tell her. Once your brother saw the papers your father carelessly left lying around, he was stuck. This mess is on your parents, and the fact that your father is taking it out on him is revolting, and the fact that you have no empathy for him is tragic.", "YTA. As well as your father. Your brother didn\u2019t ruin your parents marriage, it was already ruined. And your brother is a minor. What\u2019s wrong with you all?", "[deleted]", "YTA. Looks like your dad was planning the divorce all along. And you admit the marriage wasn\u2019t good. So why blame your brother?", "YTA\nYour parents were getting divorced whether you tried to silence your brother about it or not. Your saying all of the horrible things that happened to your dad since the divorce while not at all recognizing this was your brothers exact fear for yalls mom when he felt like he needed to tell her about what he found.\n\nYour brother came to you for guidance and you damaged him, you never felt empathy for him in the first place.\n\nYou need to apologize to your brother for blaming a failed marriage on a 16 year old boy telling the truth. And your father needs to apologize for forcing his son (even if unintentionally) in the middle of a divorce.", "YTA. Your bro was trying to be honest and protect your mom by telling her. Now your dad is upset because he got exposed for something he *was already preparing to do.* A good dad wouldn\u2019t blame his kid for the exposition of a problem that was long in the making and already boiling over before this  confrontation. You need to reassure your brother that he\u2019s not a terrible son, he just has a terrible Dad.", "YTA. Your brother is 16 and cannot be expected to handle a situation as traumatizing as the divorce of his parents with the maturity of a fully-grown adult. He does not have the requisite life experience. Holding that against him is as ridiculous and needlessly cruel as blaming him for \"ruining the marriage\" of two people for whom divorce papers had already been drawn up. \n\nYour dad is angry because he feels he lost the element of surprise and could no longer blindside your mom with a raw deal. I'm not sure why you're upset, however, unless you hate your mother and brother for some indiscernible reason.", "YTA\u2026. he\u2019s literally 16 dude like?? I wouldn\u2019t expect my significantly older siblings to respond properly in a situation like that it\u2019s very difficult and complicated\u2026 also I don\u2019t think I could keep that from my mom like wtf? Your dad fucked up when he left divorce papers in his car for your brother to find, your brother was just trying to navigate a fucking implosion on his life - you don\u2019t live at home and it doesn\u2019t sound like your entire living situation got flipped on it\u2019s head by this but for him the divorce probably completely change everything and the cherry on top is he\u2019s got a shitty sister to deal with too", "Um, your dad was planning to end the marriage -- there was nothing left to ruin.\n\nYour father is an adult punishing his minor child for seeing papers he was careless enough to leave where his son could see them. The way your father is treating him now is reprehensible. Asset distribution isn't determined at all by who files for divorce first. YTA and so is your dad.", "YTA. Your dad already had the divorce papers. If your parents had a healthy marriage he wouldn\u2019t have had the papers and your brother\u2019s concern would not have caused them to divorce. Your brother\u2014still a young person\u2014telling your mom about the papers was his way of handling a horrible discovery and maybe moved things a little faster, but he didn\u2019t change the outcome. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for you and understand you\u2019re hurting, but it is completely unfair if you to pin this on your brother. You\u2019re operating under a delusion because you want someone to blame.\n\nEdit: your dad is an AH too. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s shunning his child over this.", "YTA. It is not the kid\u2019s job to keep parents\u2019 secrets. Dad should have been more discreet with the papers if he wanted to keep them private. Your dad should be dealing with his shit in therapy so he can be a dad to his child through a really stressful time for his kid. Your dad ignoring your brother is absolutely unacceptable. There is nothing a 16 year old kid could so to deserve that.

He\u2019s not old enough to have the experience to understand how people withdraw when depressed and making it out to be his fault is cruel. You\u2019re 21, your his big sister.

Your brother is a teenager and your dad is a grown adult. He should act like an adult and father and show his son love.", "YTA. If your dad didn\u2019t want anyone to know, he shouldn\u2019t have left the papers laying around. You told him to not tell your parents, but your dad obviously already knew? And your mom deserves to know. Your dad and you are the AHs", "YTA. He is a kid. Cut him some slack.", "YTA. He didn\u2019t ruin the marriage, it sounds like it was already broken, and all he did was give your mom warning before your dad could spring the papers on her first, and she deserved to know.

And it's not like this is a stranger's marriage, they're both your guy's parents", "YTA.

I guess you take after your father.", "YTA\nYour brothers 16. \n\nYou mention that if he needed to talk about it, he could have talked to someone other than your mom\u2026 and he did! He talked to YOU. \n\nyou shut him down, and he had to sit on it knowing that his father was planning on divorcing his mother. He probably felt like he owed it to his mother to come clean, and perhaps he didn\u2019t want his mom to find out he knew before hand and get mad.\n\nYou should have talked with him about it, and if that didn\u2019t satiate him then you should have urged him to talk to his father.\nAnd while I\u2019m on that train of thought, his father shouldn\u2019t have left divorce papers where his son could find them before he got to talk to his wife about it.\n\nBoth you and your father put him in a very difficult position and his actions didn\u2019t deserve the harshness you gave him", "YTA\n\n  \nTalk about actually being the cold one here.\n\nIF divorce papers were already in the picture, then he DID NOT have anything to do with ruining the marriage, especially as a minor.", "YTA; your father should never have put a teenager in this position and you should not be blaming a teenager for his father's terrible parenting, both putting him in that position and then emotionally neglecting him. Bad parenting and you're being a bad sister.", "YTA. Your brother is a child, and found something no kid should have to keep hidden for anyone. Your dad was careless, and is now a pitiful excuse of a dad for abandoning his child for his own mess up. And you\u2019re backing him up on it? Instead of supporting your still-a-child, innocent brother? Your brother deserves so much more than you both.", "YTA. Your brother ended up accidentally knowing of a secret your father was hiding from your mother. It doesn't matter how many other people he had to talk to, it would have been eating him up inside. Sounds like your dad was going to surprise your mom and she got in first. \n\nThe fact that you can't understand how crappy the situation was for your brother? Shows you lack empathy.

He's ignoring his own son because he blames his child for his own situation.", "From your comments it seems like you\u2019re doubling down. Your brother is 16, a child. There are two adults, you and your dad, acting like he was the person that caused all of this. There would have been nothing for him to meddle in had the papers not been in the home in the first place. You\u2019re feelings are misplaced here.

Your father was already planning on going through with a divorce meaning that marriage was already on thin ice. Your brother is not at fault here. He\u2019s 16. He was trying to protect mom. Instead of being cold towards him actually be a sister and talk to him. I\u2019ve never had parents go through a divorce, but I have heard many stories of other people\u2019s parents going through a divorce and how mentally draining it can be. Talk to him.

You can't expect a kid, even a 16-year old, to keep that kind of secret. Your brother didn't cause the divorce; it was already going to happen. It is also unlikely that the mother filing first made much of a difference, unless they were going to file in different states, or unless your dad was planning to hide assets to screw your mother (which again would not be on your brother).

He clearly was hoping to spring this on your mom so he could secretly maneuver financially and screw her over. So you\u2019re upset that your mom was able to protect herself from a screwing.

I realize that you\u2019re barely an adult at 21 but your brother is even younger still and may lack the relative maturity you have. I also don\u2019t see how what he did was such a horrible thing: Would it have been better if your mom got screwed from the divorce? Besides that, though, your father\u2019s mental health isn\u2019t the responsibility nor fault of your teenaged brother. \n\nPart of adulting is knowing when to keep your judgmental attitudes to yourself and to handle uncomfortable situations with tact and dignity.

It was divorce papers he'd seen in our dads car. I told him straight up it wasn't any of our business, made him delete the photo, and made him promise not to tell our parents.\n\nThat lasted all our two weeks. He told our mother because he \"couldn't handle keeping the secret\" even though the school has counselors and stuff for him to talk to. Lot's of drama, my mother ended up being the one to divorce him, and from what I understand got the better deal. \n\nOur father isn't taking this well. He moved into a shittier appartment than the one I share, and he's been really depressed lately. He also started to get really distant with my brother, they've only spoken 2 or 3 times since hell broke loose, and even then it was mostly just school related. I've been cold too, since it's either that or being pissed off at him. I warned him to stay out of someone else's marriage, and this is why.\n\nHe called me christmas day, sobbing that dad wasn't answering his calls, and that he felt like a horrible son. I was out of empathy for him, so I let loose \"I warned you to mind your own business. I wouldn't talk to you if you ruined my marriage either. You better hope he's the bigger man and forgives you, because I wouldn't\" \n\nHe hasn't called me since, mom called me and is worried about him, she says he needs his sister. But I really don't care, which is why I'm wondering if I'm being reasonable here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your brother has a lot of maturing to do, as all minors do. Third, you might have thought the matter settled by telling him to stay out of it. But, that perspective indicates you didn\u2019t see it from your brother\u2019s perspective. Do you think your brother told your mother out of some sort of spite? Or, perhaps it was because he was worried and didn\u2019t know how to share his worries with his family? You thought it settled but it most definitely was not. Lastly, your father is also an A if he holds this against your brother; it indicates a disinterest in owning up to the role he played in all this. Your father didn\u2019t get divorced from your mother because of the actions of your brother. That\u2019s absurd. They got divorced because of their own actions.", "YTA.

The fact he struggled with it for weeks and sought your advice shows that he was really trying to do what was best, despite being in a no win situation.\n\nTbh, from the way things have turned out, it appears that he was right to choose loyalty to your mom over your dad (a position he should never have been in in the first place - and again, that is on your dad).", "YTA, but on a low butthole score for me. Your brother still lives at home, and a divorce impacts him because it's his daily life. You are moved out and nowhere near the situation, so it's easy for you, yes, it is easy for you to say \"mind your own business\" because you're not even in the same household as your family members.\n\nYour brother has no blame or fault here for discovering the divorce papers and suddenly becoming aware of the fact that his parents marriage is on the rocks. Dad was likely thinking about divorce, and he confessed to his mother what he knew.\n\nThe thing is, you're at an age and going to college where you're learning to be highly intellectual and critically think about things, and I feel like you've allowed yourself to become so critical of your little brother's decision to tell his mother because the knowledge that your father was thinking about divorce is completely swept under the rug by you. He came to you because he was panicked, and questioning the stability of his home life and you just decided to tell him to mind his business. You completely IGNORED any emotional reaction he was having because you just couldn't be bothered to realize his world was on a thread when he saw those papers and panicked. You even tried to shove him off on counseling instead of being supportive. Like \"no matter what happens, I'm your sister and I'll be here for you.\" Not this callous, distant \"mind your effin' business\" like he's some stranger. This is HIS home life that is about to be turned upside down whenever your dad decided to serve your mother, and you are living in this fantasy world where you don't think your brother would have been impacted by it.\n\nThe divorce between your parents is NOT YOUR BROTHER'S FAULT. If there were problems with their marriage, that's the reason for the divorce. Your brother is not to blame for the marriage being ruined. You were very harsh.\n\nYou really believe your parents are getting divorced because your brother meddled? You think their marriage was perfect and happy before your brother dropped the hammer? Then why did your father already have divorce papers if their marriage was going to last? All that seemed to happen was the inevitable was propelled into motion quicker. You know why your dad is blaming his son and you are blaming your brother? Because it's easier to just blame the person who blew the whistle than it is to realize that your parents were not happy.\n\nThat counseling you want your brother to get? He probably should, but so should you. You seemed to have lost your empathy and common sense along the way to feel like your brother should be dealing with this alone. For his father to estrange him after he left the divorce papers out where they could be seen is your dad's fault, not your brother. Sounds like your dad is a very immature individual to blame his son for the situation he's in, when it's exactly what he was thinking about doing himself. Sounds like you're following in dad's footsteps with that, and I don't see that as a good thing.\n\nYou need to apologize to your brother, whose whole world was turned upside down and he's losing half of his family because he couldn't deal with the pressure of coming home one day and finding out that's the day dad decided to divorce mom. He's a kid. He is a kid.\n\nYou're the adult, and you're playing a blame game just like some kindergartener would. Grow up. You were never going to witness the falling out personally like your brother would, and it sounds like you don't even care about what your mother is going through since you sparsely mentioned how she feels about it. All you see is that your dad is depressed, when he's the one who was thinking about this exact path. Again, this is something you conveniently ignore because you're not even home to have to deal with this and you choose for yourself what's important.\n\nI hope your brother goes no contact with someone who's showing the developing traits of a narcissist \\[you\\].\n\nIf you found out tomorrow that your brother killed himself over this, because you made him feel like he is to blame and did nothing to assure him that he wasn't a bad son to his father, would you do anything differently?\n\nI'm gonna go looking for a throw away reddit account where your brother may be asking AITA for ruining my parents marriage, or True off my chest, I ruined my parent's marriage. \n\nDoes that seem right to you?", "You are an AWFUL sibling, I feel awful for that poor kid.

It's fine if Daddy dearest wants to spring divorce on your mother and take nearly everything but when mama does it you're all uptight? I can see who your favorite parent is. By the way there was no staying out of it for your brother. It was his life that was getting completely flipped. He's sixteen. At that age he's already got alot emotionally going on now this? Kid sounds like he's spiraling down to bad thoughts town. He needs you to be there for him. Not acting like judge, jury and executioner for him.

Who you must not like if you're mad she 'got the better deal\" while your dad is living in a crappy apartment.\n\nWell guess what? None of this is his fault and you're jerks for even acting like it is. Your parents were gonna get a divorce anyway if your father had anything to say about it.
