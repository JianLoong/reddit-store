Sure, it sounds like his plan didn't match her expectations. But he also proposed *where they met.* That's not an unusual or unexpected thing for people to do. At all.

Easy as that.", "INFO: did Stephen ask for your opinion? \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong, but throwing out an unwanted opinion is kind of an asshole move in my book.", "I'm gonna say \nYTA\nFor how you told him it was bad. I can see the effort since it was the place they met and that he hoped that it was as special to her as to him. I also understand that A LOT of people would not want to be proposed to at a bar of all places. I agree you should tell him he picked a bad place to pop the question, but to tell him it was disrespectful and messed up after he's been rejected IS disrespectful. Call him and apologize, I wouldn't be surprised if he proposed properly and didn't want you at the wedding if she said yes.", "YTA. A lot of the comments are based on his proposal and if it was right or not. But the fact is a close friend got a shocking bad news and needed you support, and you let him down.

But at the same time, Dina should be thinking about whether or not she loves the guy, not where and how he asked her. It's one moment where he was an asshole--unless she thinks, with good reason, that this is likely to be a pattern in their marriage, she ought to chalk it up to one dumb move and say yes.\n\nThe proposal is one moment.

Inconsiderate I can see, but instead of showing the tiniest bit of empathy and kindness towards someone you\u2019ve been friends with for years it seems you berated and belittled his feelings. \n\nAlso you sound like a busy body. Stay out of their relationship, you\u2019re obviously not helping.\n\nEdit: actually I\u2019m leaning towards YTA it was not a disrespectful proposal and you took the chance away for them to talk about first.

That was a big mistake.\n\nOP, you've inserted yourself into this situation, when it's not clear that you're welcome. Did anyone ask you to get involved? It sounds like you talked to Dina just out of simple curiosity, and then launched into criticism of Stephen. How did that help? Did Stephen want you to help iron things out? Did Dina? Then why proactively jump in on a very sensitive, personal issue?\n\nAnd Dina. Very, very slightly problematic, in that I wonder what her endgame is. I fully understand the difference between intent vs. impact. And she doesn't want to reward bad behavior.

It showed how absolutely little he thought I mattered.  All he had to do was listen to what I wanted about things that involved me.  \n\n(BTW he failed out of school and when I found out ***after*** he had proposed he said \"but you'd make enough money for both of us so it shouldn't matter\".  He wanted to be a stay at home husband which for him was code for playing video games all day.  He failed out of college because he couldn't be assed to go to class and played games all day instead.

You are caught up in semantics.", "Are you being facetious? \n\n> Not true, all my best friends have proposed to me at some point or other and we remain as thick as thieves\n\nThis is what you said in response to me saying their relationship was over after the failed proposal. If you aren\u2019t married to any of those people whose proposals you initially rejected then it proves my point. Failed proposal = end of relationship", "The ending was pretty boring. We broke up not too long after that because he kept pressing, and I was not interested.", "seconded, i gotta know what happens next! lol", "No she called his friend to congratulate him her friend said she said no.

Conversation is private, building is public.", "YTA. It\u2019s honestly not your place to comment. Yeah it was wrong of him but you\u2019re not the one who has to tell him that.

Let them hash it out themselves.", "YTA a proposal is about both of them not just her. I'd HATE a public proposal but if my husband had done it that way I'd have been disappointed, possibly even upset but I would still have said \"yes\" because I wanted to marry him. Saying \"no\" to getting married because you don't like the delivery of the proposal would be a big red flag to me for the future of that relationship. Aside from that its none of your damn business.", "YTA I don't know if you're a guy but you basically have no listening skills. Listening is different from hearing. You and your friend both!\n\nThe problem is not that it was in a bar. That's not the point his GF made. The point she made was that she does not want a public proposal!\n\nIt does not matter that it was in a bar. It could have been in a beach full of people or in the restaurant of a nice cruise, in the middle of a concert, etc and the result wkd have bee the same: A resounding NO! because it was in public.\n\nThen you went and told him the wrong thing, that it was disrespectful but the proposal wasn't disrespectful. The fact that he does listen to her is extremely inconsiderate and a massive red flag and that is what you should have told him! \n\nEvereyone, listen carefully! If you So does not actively listen to you they are not worth it!", "You should stay out of this as it\u2019s none of your business", "YTA - for inserting yourself into his relationship like this. This isn't any of your business to tell your friend what you think. His gf already did that.", "YTA\n\nIf she really wanted to be with him she woulda said yes. Sounds like she is having doubts anyhow.", "YTA I do think it would be nice as a friend to just be there for him instead of rehashing how he did the proposal \"wrong\" . Obviously he thought what he planned was in line with what Dina wanted, but was wrong. I also tend to think that if she was in love with him and wanted to marry him she'd say yes, regardless of how the proposal went. I see some folks talking about people deserving a no to their proposal if they're presented with the wrong ring and the girlfriend wants gold versus silver, but I think that's superficial nonsense. These things can be adjusted or switched out after the fact, but the love and the relationship and the partnership should be the deciding factor. We're talking about a life partnership and if the \"wrong\" kind of proposal is enough for her to say \"No. I don't want to spend my life with you\", then your friend dodged a bullet anyway. My point is maybe you could just be there for him considering all of that. Sometimes when friends share an incident that made them upset they just want their friend to listen and empathize rather than analyze the situation or figure out what went wrong or how to fix it. Looks like a listening ear would have been the play here and and saying that he was disrespectful wasn't. I'm thinking the girlfriend is the AH too.", "YTA, but not for the reason you think.

She told him what she would like in a proposal, and he did something else.  When people tell you what they want and you don't listen, they have every right to say \"Hmm, maybe this isn't quite right for me.\"  And if Dina has seen other examples of Stephan not listening, or confusing what HE wants with what he decides SHE must want... then his bass-ackwards proposal may have been a final straw for her.  \n\n\nBack off, let them figure it out, and be there to support whatever they decide.", "YTA - Telling him his proposal was \"disrespectful\" and \"kind of messed up\" was not the kind of thing a friend would do.

Whose friend are you? Hers? His? Nobody's? Why are you so far up in their business?", "YTA. Mind your business", "YTA\n\nYour friend botched a proposal.\n\nObviously this is a sensitive subject and unless he specifically asked for your input, you meddled in an event that had literally NOTHING to do with you. You telling him this doesn't change anything.\n\nYou say she confided to you in private, but then you used that information to criticize your friend.

Dude didn't even have to put in the effort to make an on-line reservation. I suspect he didn't even line up a good bottle of champagne beforehand and was hopping the bar would just comp them something.

If you ignore what they said, then you should expect a No. \n\nWhy in the world would you think it is OK to just ignore the literal words out of her mouth and just assume you know what she meant? Of course, sometimes people say words, but mean something different, but that is when you ask for clairification. You don't stage a public proposal based on your assumptuon that the words \"I don't want a public proposal\" don't actually mean \"I don't want a public proposal\".\n\nAlso, he should know his GF better by now, to be honest. Not knowing what she meant indicates he just isn't paying attention to who she is.\n\nRe: only one idea. That isn't an excuse, I'm sorry.  Ok, lets assume he couldn't get past \"bar we met\" and there was just nothing else special to them that he could think of (very sad). He STILL didn't have to do a  public proposal. How about checking if the bar has a  romantic private room? How about a nice dinner and a stop at the bar and then a stop a spot w/ a view and propose. How about nice dinner and she comes home to the ring in a glass from the bar on the kitchen table w/ her favorite flowers? There are hundreds of ways to incorporate \"bar we met\" into a proposal and the most ridiculous part, it that he didn't need to come up w/ it himself. All he had to do was goolge \"proposal ideas\" and find something low key that he could incorporate  \"bar we met\" or ask friends/family for propsal stories. \n\nAll it took for the guy to get it right was a little bit of communication and a little bit of effort.

If it\u2019s not then good, but if it is that would be really concerning. Even if it\u2019s not a pattern a discussion needs to be had so he can internalize why she\u2019s upset and put an effort into being more mindful towards her/in their relationship.\n\nBesides, proposing where you met is a romance movie trope. Most meeting places aren\u2019t a spot someone would want to be proposed to, like if any of the dudes I\u2019ve dated the past few years proposed where we met then it\u2019d be on tinder or at a bar. No way in hell would I be cool with either of those, especially if I had expressed not wanting a public proposal like the girlfriend of OP\u2019s friend.

It has been over a year since I left my last abusive ex and I still feel like an insecure shell of who I was when I met him.\n\nYou deserve better, I really hope you can get out safely and have the support you deserve to help you get out. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated that way. It\u2019s really hard in your position, feeling stuck in a toxic situation. It took me a long time to get away from the last guy I was in a serious relationship with because I didn\u2019t see a way out that was safe, I was so stuck in survival mode. Scared of what would happen if I tried to leave and couldn\u2019t, but scared of what would happen if I didn\u2019t manage to leave. I was lucky enough that I was able to get a protection order one evening after he escalated. It almost didn\u2019t work because I didn\u2019t know what on the form would work, all I knew was that I was scared of him and if I went home without a protection order that it wouldn\u2019t be safe. I guess the woman working at the counter saw my distress when she was telling me it likely wouldn\u2019t be granted, so she began going through everything and asking me questions. She was able to grant the temp one based on involuntary confinement (he tried to make it impossible for me to leave the house often). Forever going to be so thankful for the woman who helped me.\n\nI really hope you get out soon and that while you make your plan you are at least physically safe. Living in that situation is so so hard.", "Could also just be that the friend is so emotionally invested in this and upset about how his proposal went that he's doubling down on OP. Still not great but a little more understandable.", "Proposing at the place they met is not necessarily a bad move, but Mr. Proposer wasn't listening to his lovely woman when she said NO public proposals.  Nothing would feel romantic after Mr. Proposer put her on the spot publicly.\n\nHe should try proposing again in a few months . . . and get it right.", "And what a red flag this could be for the future.  Is this how we will respect her wishes for wedding venue?  Children's names?  Mother-in-law unannounced visits?  House purchases?\n\nI don't know this guy, but if he proposed to me like this after what I had made clear, numerous times, I might need space to reconsider the future.  Was it a one-off, or is this a routine issue?", "Does it have to do with a person's peepee region?", "All of these responses above and below!! \n\n Here a PSA for future proposers (?):  *** Do Not Publicly Propose to your SO.***  No Jumbotron, no Restaurant or bar, not at So's workplace in front of coworkers, DEF not in front of mom/dad/sibs/cousins....and, as in my case, not using the band's microphone at a New Years Eve dance at a major hotel!!!", "Why not both? \ud83c\udf2e\ud83c\udf2f", "Talk about pressuring someone- in public at an internationally known monument in another country! This is practically a perfect set up for the threat of an abusive partner leaving their SO broke and stranded if they say no. (Not that I'm saying your friend's SO is/was abusive)", "Not who you asked this of, just someone who has been in similar relationships where I felt stuck and unable to leave. In my case I wasn\u2019t able to afford to get out, he would do things that drained my money as well. When we moved to our own place he left his job. He lied and said his car wasn\u2019t working, but also said he was getting it fixed and would return to work when it was fixed then just never went back to work. His car magically worked whenever I was at work though, otherwise he would take mine and drain the gas. I was refilling my car like every single day. Eventually I started only putting enough to get to and from work in every day. I was paying all our bills, for all the food, it got to the point where I had to use all my savings to keep up with bills. When I started only filling enough gas for getting to and from work he started doing things to increase our bills. He would turn on the shower and let it run for hours for example.\n\nHe also wouldn\u2019t let me sleep. I already had insomnia, but if he noticed me drifting off he would turn on all the lights and yell. I was too exhausted to think, much less plan how to get out of there and find ways to lessen the bills he was purposely making super expensive. I just couldn\u2019t see a way out. He spent so much time yelling at me, just absolutely berating me that I had lost all confidence in myself. I would wonder if I really was as horrible and unlovable as he would say. Each time I tried to leave the house to try and find somewhere to sleep, like at a friends, he would call the cops. \n\nThe PD was so close by that I couldn\u2019t even make it out of the neighborhood and by the time the cops would leave it would be too late to go anywhere other than home to him. He would tell them I was drunk even though I wasn\u2019t or would tell them I was threatening to harm myself even though I hadn\u2019t. Eventually things escalated so much one night that this one cop who was often one of the guys responding to calls he had made in the past told me he was worried about what could happen if I didn\u2019t get out. He kept telling me I needed to go get a protective order. He had told me that in the past when we would talk while waiting for me to be cleared as not drunk or a threat to myself, but I never went because from what I had read could cause one to be granted never seemed to fit. Turns out him calling the cops every time I tried to leave the house to get some sleep was a reason for one being granted.\n\nI\u2019m thankful for the people who helped me find a solution, I was so broken down and exhausted that I didn\u2019t know how to even think about making a plan to leave, much less think at all. I\u2019m surprised I never went through psychosis considering how little sleep I was getting, like it was common for me to get no sleep for 48 hours and then when I did sleep, it only lasted about 2-3 hours every 2-3 days. I was getting less sleep per week than people are supposed to get in a night.\n\nLike I said, I\u2019m not who you responded to, but I hope my response helps you understand how insidious abuse can be. It can feel impossible to leave. Getting the protective order was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve done. I was scared of what would happen if the temporary one was denied, scared of what my ex was capable of doing to me. I kept thinking about what could happen if I went home and had to face him. I don\u2019t know if I would have survived that night if the temp hadn\u2019t been granted. Thankfully it was and then when I had a court date to extend it a few days later it was granted for the maximum amount of time they allow in the courts. Soon I\u2019ll be able to petition to have it extended and hopefully the extension is granted. The way he was abusive was meant to make sure I couldn\u2019t leave him, that can happen often in abusive relationships, especially when someone is high in narcissistic traits or a person who has full blown NPD. My ex didn\u2019t care about me, he cared about control.", "That was my thought, maybe his idea of a 'public' proposal is like what u see on TV, like when they do it on the kiss cam, center field/court/etc or when the guy gets everyone's attention and makes a big scene, maybe he thought the two of them at a table didn't count?

He respected my preferences but acknowledged a place important to us. True there was no \u201cdown on one knee\u201d moment and the ring came later, but it was perfect.

Those are different things, and in his shoes, I would not have taken from her words that the latter was unacceptable.", "NTA - I see what he was trying to do, but he did exactly what she asked him not to do.\n\nDid he ask her loudly so people around them knew what was going on?

There's some nuance here. \n\nI can understand why Stephen is upset with you not being a supportive friend. I know it's comical on the surface, and you just wanna roll your eyes because guys will be guys. But you have to remember, this dudes heart is broken right now. Regardless of if it's his fault or not. He just worked up the courage to propose to the person he loves and was shot down. That's not some throwaway event.

He's in denial that he misread the room.  She had told him what to avoid and he didn't listen.  It's all on him.  I would leave it alone from here on out though.  Not your business.

I don't fault anyone who wants a public proposal, although it is personally not what I would want.  \n\nThis reminds me of when a friend worked for a restaurant during high school.

The staff was totally on board.\n\nHowever, the guy's would-be fiancee refused dessert after dinner!  Chalk it up to nerves, but the guy didn't want dessert:  He only wanted *his* girlfriend to order it.

She relented, yet she was angry because he was pestering her.\n\nWhen the plate arrived with the proposal on it, my friend recounted how the look on this woman's face was sheer horror.  Whether or not she wanted to marry him can be left up to debate, but my friend told me how this woman was just staring at this plate of cheesecake in a   restaurant that had fallen silent.  She did not look happy.\n\nShe...accepted, but the secondhand embarrassment that my friend talked about was palpable.  She felt bad for the guy, but worse for his girlfriend.
