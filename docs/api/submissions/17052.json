Sure, it sounds like his plan didn't match her expectations. But he also proposed *where they met.* That's not an unusual or unexpected thing for people to do. At all.

Easy as that.", "INFO: did Stephen ask for your opinion? \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong, but throwing out an unwanted opinion is kind of an asshole move in my book.", "I'm gonna say \nYTA\nFor how you told him it was bad. I can see the effort since it was the place they met and that he hoped that it was as special to her as to him. I also understand that A LOT of people would not want to be proposed to at a bar of all places. I agree you should tell him he picked a bad place to pop the question, but to tell him it was disrespectful and messed up after he's been rejected IS disrespectful. Call him and apologize, I wouldn't be surprised if he proposed properly and didn't want you at the wedding if she said yes.", "YTA. A lot of the comments are based on his proposal and if it was right or not. But the fact is a close friend got a shocking bad news and needed you support, and you let him down.

But it would be different if it were a sibling.\n\nNTA, sort of?", "NTA. Clearly this girl is a bit of a prissy, if they met in a bar how is proposing in a bar any worse or better. She's comfortable enough to move in without being married but then all of a sudden expects a lot of formality around a proposal.

But at the same time, Dina should be thinking about whether or not she loves the guy, not where and how he asked her. It's one moment where he was an asshole--unless she thinks, with good reason, that this is likely to be a pattern in their marriage, she ought to chalk it up to one dumb move and say yes.\n\nThe proposal is one moment.

Inconsiderate I can see, but instead of showing the tiniest bit of empathy and kindness towards someone you\u2019ve been friends with for years it seems you berated and belittled his feelings. \n\nAlso you sound like a busy body. Stay out of their relationship, you\u2019re obviously not helping.\n\nEdit: actually I\u2019m leaning towards YTA it was not a disrespectful proposal and you took the chance away for them to talk about first.

That was a big mistake.\n\nOP, you've inserted yourself into this situation, when it's not clear that you're welcome. Did anyone ask you to get involved? It sounds like you talked to Dina just out of simple curiosity, and then launched into criticism of Stephen. How did that help? Did Stephen want you to help iron things out? Did Dina? Then why proactively jump in on a very sensitive, personal issue?\n\nAnd Dina. Very, very slightly problematic, in that I wonder what her endgame is. I fully understand the difference between intent vs. impact. And she doesn't want to reward bad behavior.

It showed how absolutely little he thought I mattered.  All he had to do was listen to what I wanted about things that involved me.  \n\n(BTW he failed out of school and when I found out ***after*** he had proposed he said \"but you'd make enough money for both of us so it shouldn't matter\".  He wanted to be a stay at home husband which for him was code for playing video games all day.  He failed out of college because he couldn't be assed to go to class and played games all day instead.

(I sent him the link to the auction and offered to return the ring to him at any point until a buyer sent me payment)", "Ugh, bad proposal ladies unite!  \n\nI told my ex not to propose publicly, to wait until college was over (which we were starting our last set of final exams for so not a huge wait), and to let me have some input on the ring since I was picky about jewelry.  \n\nHe proposed by telling me he needed to talk to me on the afternoon before my biggest exam at a park in front of a group of strangers, had the most god awful ring I've ever seen in my life, and paraded me around to family the rest of the day when I should have been studying.   I was an idiot that said yes because I was too embarrassed to say no in front of a group.  I broke it off not long after though.  \n\nYes, ignoring clearly defined wants about a proposal and ring that we will be wearing the rest of our lives is a ***HUGE*** red flag about how little they care about us.  \n\nMen: just ask us what we want and we will tell you.  \n\nThat's what my current partner did and our wedding is in a year.  He listened to me.  He cares.", "I'm so glad that other people feel this way. I didn't see it as a red flag at first but I definitely know he didn't listen to me when I said what I wanted. I'm the same way with diamonds. I'm just not a huge fan, but I love different types of stones. I was proposed to, in my car before going to our usual Sunday breakfast, with diamond ring. I knew he didn't have much to spend on a ring which was fine, I was more upset that he didn't listen to what I wanted.", "My first fiance was back in the days of J. Lo's pink diamond ring. My least favorite color is pink. I honestly can't stand pink. What does he get? A J. Lo replica ring. Which then turns into an invitation to everybody I know to get me all things pink. My older sister got me a pink dress for a family event to match my ring because she knew I hated pink but also knew I wouldn't want to clash. Which led to my younger siblings and my stepmom buying me pink things whenever they came across them. My life turned pink.", "Whenever I see videos of those, I tell myself that they've discussed this (to some extent) and the proposer has insider knowledge that yes, for sure the proposee will appreciate this.\n\nThat's probably not true in all cases - but the thought means I can enjoy seeing people so excited to have been proposed to.", "There\u2019s also definitely an element of \u201cif I do this publicly she can\u2019t say no/will be pressured to say yes\u201d which is icky too.", "I'm pretty oblivious to hints, signs and insinuations. This has causes problem in past relationships, especially when I was young, when a partner would give hints she wanted something and I would not get it.\n\nBut this is a whole other level... she literally told him what she wanted. And the guy still screw this up.\n\nReminds me a AITA, where the girl said she wanted her family and friends present for the proposal. The guy asks her BFF for advice in the proposal, BFF reiterates several times the girl wants her family and friends present. Comes proposal, only HIS family and HIS friends are present. None of hers. Not even her BFF who he asked advice from.\n\nThen he got upset when she said NO \"humiliating\" him in front of his family and friends.", "To me, the obvious solution is to start the date at the bar and reminisce about the first date, and then go for a walk after to somewhere nice and remote to do the actual proposal.", "The location isn't the issue. The problem is that Stephen completely ignored Dina's feelings - i.e. that she would not wabtva public proposal.\n\nIf both of them had been on biard with the idea then the bar could have been the perfect place.", "I mean, it depends. I know people who met at work (and since changed jobs), and they got engaged in front of that building they worked in. It was a very special/unusual work place and a special time in their lives. As long as it's meaningful to the couple, it doesn't have to be fancy.", "He doesn't seem to understand the scale of how bad it was and why his proposal was bad. If anything OP is being a good friend by saying why. It doesn't sound to me that she is piling on him. It sounds like he needs help understanding why he was turned down.", "What\u2019s messed up and disrespectful isn\u2019t the bar so much as purposely doing a public proposal when Gf specifically told him she did NOT want a public proposal. It\u2019s not respecting or caring about her boundaries at the worst and at the least shows he doesn\u2019t listen to her. That shit 100% should be called out.", "Is Stephen a weight-lifter? Maybe he was attracted to Dina because she was a bar belle.", "Instead he\u2019s digging his heels in, that\u2019ll end well.", "Nice follow up", "I guess her didn't set the bar high enough", "Mine too", "may i interest you in r/angryupvote", "You don't always need to be unconditionally supportive, especially when someone is making/made a mistake.", "I disagree. Sometimes being a supportive friend is calling them out on their crap.\n\nAccording to OP, the friend was told multiple times by the gf that she did not want a public proposal. This means he disregarded her comfort and directly went against her wishes. My concern would be that if he didn't respect this boundary, are there other boundaries that he doesn't accept? A good friend would call them out on that kind of behavior", "Clearly he doesn\u2019t listen to his girlfriend, though. Maybe OP will have more luck getting through his skull.", "Right!! To me, that's an early warning sign of a very sad and lonely future. \n\nIf I asked for a private proposal and after three years, they propose in public?? I would seriously consider staying in that relationship at all. \n\nIntentionally placing me in an uncomfortable position, to make you happy? Nope. Nope. Nope. I want nothing to do with that, ever again.", "It\u2019s actually worse because if they\u2019ve never had a discussion on gold/silver it\u2019s yeah possible he\u2019s just clueless and never noticed (not great but eh). But in this case she flat out told him she did not want a public proposal. It doesn\u2019t get more clear than that!", "Dina told him her perspective and he dismissed it. You gave him yours and he rejected it. Does he listen to anybody? Or is that not necessary because he knows it all?", "r/onejob", "It's been 40 years and she still won't let him live it down. LMAO. To dad's credit though, he let her pick the exact ring and diamond she wanted. I'd think I made up for dad's silliness with my proposal to my wife: her mom let me use her own diamond from her engagement ring. I spent 3mo learning enough Hebrew on duolingo to pop the question in both Hebrew and English. Our Israeli friend helped me with the pronunciation. Anyways, we had small covid wedding and now we're expecting our first child 3yrs later!", "Op is a woman", "I probably would have talked to them both individually too, given you said you're close friends with her as well, but I would have asked her if she wanted me to talk to him about it after that. \n\nSometimes it's okay, and even helpful to be involved in helping people communicate better but not always. You had great intentions, just maybe one step too far.", "Public proposals are any proposal that happens in public with people around. Unless the bar was completely empty, this qualifies as such.", "Yeah but she judged the bar aspect without knowing anything else, she would never have supported Stephen.", "INFO: OP did Dina say whether it was a we are breaking up goodbye no or I didn't like your proposal do better no", "Omg this. Total EW at the thought that marriage is an end all be all goal that a person should just be happy that they are married even if it's with a person who doesn't respect you as a person.", "Yeah it\u2019s really not about the proposal, it\u2019s about the disrespect. I can live with a lousy proposal because it\u2019s just one moment but I can\u2019t live with someone who doesn\u2019t show me basic respect", "Literally said \u201che also blatantly disregarded her feelings about it, maybe she dodged a bullet too\u201d.", "If your wife asked you specifically to not do something, and then you did exactly that, it shows that you don\u2019t listen to her or respect her. The girlfriend was right to say no. She would\u2019ve been signing up for a life with a guy who doesn\u2019t respect her.", "OP is a woman and has a boyfriend", "Well why can\u2019t a man propose how he wants? Why is it always just what the woman wants? Doesn\u2019t his opinion matter as well? It was important to him. Or does that not matter at all?\n\nIt can go both ways.\n\nShe said no because of HOW he proposed. Not because she didn\u2019t want to marry him, not because she wasn\u2019t ready to marry him. But because of how he went about it.", "No you're definitely not alone with red flags at rings. I'm cool toned and gold looks awful against my skin tone, so while I wouldn't be upset about getting a nice ring, it's still a, \"you should ask before you buy\", especially with how much more gold costs than silver.", ">overpriced cruelty trash\n\nNah you're missing the point: the cruelty is what gives it value /s\n\nFr though they make artificial diamonds that are more pure then the real thing and people still buy them -\\_-", "I went through something a little similar. Guy I was with proposed when we were in the middle of a fight (about him disregarding my feelings on things) and had the option that I could pick out a different ring later. However, when picking the ring he was mad that I didn't want the really expensive popular ring but wanted something that was more unique and was also cheaper. He actually insulted the ring I was in love with and was refusing to get it until I walked out crying. We obviously did not stay together. \n\nIn comparison, my now husband asked for a copy of my Pinterest board of rings when we started discussing getting married. While I was out of town (months later) he went to a jeweler and showed the associate my board so that they could help him find some options I'd like. I'm literally obsessed with my ring and love that he tried to pick something I'd be happy with. \n\nQuality men are out there but sometimes you have to go through a few duds first.", "Congrats on your upcoming wedding! I'm so glad you found a good partner who listens and cares about you \u2764\ufe0f", "That could work! My memory is pretty poor, so I find new adventures/exploring much more fascinating. Just reinvigorates the fact that Steve should listen to his SO.", "I was thinking it would have been really sweet if he rented out the bar for the evening. Split a bottle of champagne or whatever she likes to drink, reminisce about how happy you are together, then propose.\n\nThen maybe her close friends and family show up afterward to celebrate (not to witness) the engagement. This second part really depends on how private the fianc\u00e9e is though.", "You had no right to make me spit my coffee out.", "Gee thanks. It's probably your fault my husband just texted me this really bad pun. Take my updoot and reflect on what you've done.", "[removed]", "He's already made the mistake & his GF called him out on it. You don't need to be unconditionally supportive but sometimes it's best to not rub peoples faces in their mistakes", "That along with the added pressure of it being public at all with the pressure and expectation to say yes from everyone around you", "My husband knew I didn\u2019t want a public proposal, or a diamond ring. He proposed to me at a park that means a lot to both of us, at twilight, and gave me a beautiful garnet ring with a diamond halo. \n\nHonestly? Listening is the absolute  minimum with something like this.", "Omg that it s cute.", "And?", "I was just giving another perspective that he could have regarded the moment as private even in a bar if it was kept between the two of them.  Bars are noisy and you can\u2019t really hear other people\u2019s conversations.", "Nice!", "No I think you\u2019re missing the point. She said no because the proposal illustrated that he doesn\u2019t listen to her or respect her clearly-stated preferences. You can live with a lousy proposal because it\u2019s just one moment, but you can\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) live with someone who doesn\u2019t show you consideration and respect. \n\nA relationship is about two people! The proposer should take their own preferences AND the preferences of the person they are proposing to into account. In this case, he only cared about himself", "And moissanite which is better than diamond in every conceivable way and can be easily lab made to any color combo you want", "Definitely", "Stolen comment. Downvote and report.", "Well he obviously has a hard time absorbing anything his gf says if he gave her an opposite proposal of what she wanted. Maybe he needed to hear it from someone other than his gf that he doesn\u2019t respect in the slightest.", "Anyone at the Larkspur Renn Faire in the mid 2000s may have caught sight of a woman in a dress hauling ass with people chasing her. That was me running from an impromptu public proposal when my brain froze over and I went into full on flight mode. \n\nI imagine it as a highly cinematic moment, with my flower crown flying up into the air, my dress billowing in the wind, and the entire faire pausing for a moment to watch the woman tearing across the fair at top speed with at least two friends in pursuit trying to stop her. \n\n\u2026it was an awkward car ride back home.", "Yes!! I would either say something like \"hell no, what are you doing??\"\n\nOr I would do as the Renn Faire Queen did, and freaking run away/leave.", "That's exactly what I thought reading your first paragraph! \n\nThat sounds so sweet, and so thoughtful!! Beautiful! Listening is literally the bare minimum and if OPs friend can't even do that, his girlfriend deserves so much better.", "Lol you have to be joking", "I love This. It should be a short story or narrative podcast or something. The visual is everything.", "I know that was probably a terrible experience for you but I\u2019m sorry I *laughed*. You know you fucked up when your prospective bride literally *runs* from you.\n\nHonestly I would probably freeze, say no, and then burst into tears so."]}
