He told me that he was planning to propose to Dina, and I was ecstatic.\n\nWell, the day of the proposal hits, and I called Stephen the next day, which was last night, to congratulate him.

She confided in me that it's because she told Stephen multiple times that she didn't want to have a public proposal, and that she was horrified he would do it at a bar of all places and that she felt disrespected that he didn't accommodate that.\n\nI told Stephen that his proposal was honestly really disrespectul and seriously kind of messed up, to which he told me I was being an insensitive AH and should be supportive as his friend rather that talking down on him, but I don't know if I'm wrong here.\n\nAITA for calling my friend's proposal disrespectful?", "created_utc": 1683902862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fn8s6/aita_for_calling_my_friends_proposal_disrespectful/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His interpretation of public might be different from hers. Did he make a big show of proposing at the bar or was it quite proposal that just happened to be in a public place? \n\nAlso I think men get very nervous to propose, he had the idea and that was all he could come up with.

He put his idea of \"romantic\" above her wishes.  This is a clear indication of the dynamic of their relationship.  I am sure this is not the only time he has done that.  Good for her that she recognizes it and said no.

They require you to really know your partner. Have you actually listened to their wants and needs? Do your wants and needs line up with theirs? If you're in a relationship headed for marriage this should be a joyful moment with a clear answer, but there are so many ways for it to go sour.

You make an excellent point.", "YTA for interfering.  \n\nAs far as the couple is concerned\u2026she didn\u2019t want a public proposal but I don\u2019t think this really is one. It seems like a private moment took place in a public but meaningful place. To me, a public proposal involves making all the strangers in the room spectators (like when people propose at sporting events on the kiss cam or ask a DJ at a bar/club to lend them the microphone). Those are public proposals. And really tacky."]}
