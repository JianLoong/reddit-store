We have had our ups and downs as every couple has but we have always been good about figuring things out. I have never been the type of person to get upset over my significant other hanging out with people of the opposite sex. I have trust in him and care for him greatly. The only time that is not the case is when he is with his girl best friend. \n\nI never cared about their relationship until I learned more about their past relationship. In the past he had a girlfriend and cheated on her 3 times with his best friend and were fuck buddies for quite a while, she is also a year older than him. I talked to my boyfriend about how I felt and he reassured me that was in his past and that he is with me because he wants to be with me and only me. I believe him and trust him. But my boyfriend and I had something happen recently. \n\nSo my boyfriend and I have always been interested in Choir, Band, and Theater. I am a stage manager in theater and he is an actor so we are both afterschool EVERYDAY for theater and sometimes choir or band. On one particular day there was a choir concert so after rehearsals we had to stay late for our concert. I always have fun as I have many friends in the department but his bsf was there too. She was a bit anxious for the concert which was understandable so they went and talked and I didn\u2019t think too much of it. They had been in one of our choir practice rooms the only weird thing was that the lights were off. To me I just thought since she was anxious she just wanted dim lights to calm her down but they were in there longer than expected. \n\nThree hours pass and they are still in the practice rooms with the lights off together. I started to get worried as most people would. I was scared to go and knock as I didnt know what they were doing. I opened up to a very close friend of mine about how I was feeling and we just kinda talked about it. Right before the concert they came out and all was good. The next day he came to me pissed off about how \u201cI was talking about him to people\u201d It was not like I was talking shit I was just anxious and talked to a friend about it. He explained the situation and I understood but he keeps saying it my fault we were arguing because I decided to talk about it with someone.\n\nI understand what he is saying but I only told one person and we are very close and it wasnt shit talking I was just anxious.
