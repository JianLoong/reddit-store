(and neither is my sister) i think they\u2019re cute or whatever but i cant stand having dogs jump up at me or bark whenever someone rings the doorbell or get white hairs all over my black clothes.  But my parents and brother (m8) are huge dog people. I\u2019m talking calling them \u2018doggos\u2019 and letting them lick their faces. \n\nSo fast forward to now. I obviously still make sure my dog is okay when i\u2019m in the house with it (letting it play in the garden, making sure it has food, etc) and thank god its out of the puppy stage now because i had to clean up poop from the kitchen floor multiple times. \n\nBut yesterday, i was off school with period cramps and when my mum got home she asked me to take the dog on a walk. I said no because i have cramps and just feel tired right now. But also because i just don\u2019t like walking the dog. I know thats a bit unfair but she always pulls at the lead (shes a border collie so she\u2019s strong) and if i let her off lead I\u2019m scared i\u2019m gonna lose her. \n\nMy mum started saying i never do  anything to help (which isn\u2019t true because i do all my chores) and i said to her something like: \u201cshe\u2019s not my dog, i never agreed to get her. you decided that. i don\u2019t even want her.\u201d \nMy mum blew up and took my phone from me. (typing this from my backup) When my dad got home he said that i was \u201cselfish and i had no heart and that our dog was a family dog.\u201d But again, i never asked for her! Nothing against her but personally I would really prefer a dog free home. \n\nAlso, if me or my sister (f13) ever complain that the dog smells ready bad, or it tries to lick everything, or it chewed up something my dad always gets really angry at us. Like he seriously likes that dog better than us i swear. \n\nSo yeah thats what happened now my parents are pissed and won\u2019t speak to me. \nI know this doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal compared to other posts but i just wanted to get it out there. \nIm fully open to the idea that i\u2019m the AH but i just wanted other peoples opinion.", "created_utc": 1684501003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lupzl/aita_for_not_liking_the_family_dog/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I disagree, this is a BIG DEAL, especially as your family brought a Border Collie into your home.\n\nYou adamently do not want a dog in your home and you've communicated this to your parents.  Yet they didn't bring just any dog to your home... they brought in a Border Collie.\n\nI believe that Border Collies are some of the best dogs; they are intelligent and they are hugely energetic.  They need time, activities and human engagement - all the time.  They are excellent herders for a reason.\n\nSo, your parents brought a Border Collie into a home where there is little opportunity to exercise and with family members who are not invested in the dog.  Poor choice on their part.     \n\nI normally *do not reply to anything posted by a teenager*, but in this case you are correct.  I hope my expectations are wrong. I see this dog destroying your home and becoming physically aggressive.  ALL OF WHICH is not your fault.\n\n\\*\\*OR\\*\\* you could take up long-distance running and exercise this dog daily.  But when you're ready to move out this dog will be yours...\n\nAll of this is an ugly situation.  I mostly sympathize with the dog, and you.", "NTA for not liking the dog. Not everyone is a dog person or interested in owning pets. And that's something you can decide for yourself when you are out of your parents' home. But for now, the dog exists and it needs love and care and it belongs to your family, so you're going to be asked to help with the dog's care, even if it isn't 'your' dog. \n\nMaybe when asked to do dog-related things that you really won't enjoy or really don't want to do, offer to do a different task instead just to keep the peace? Like, \"Mom I really don't want to walk the dog, I don't feel good. But if you let me lay down for a few hours, I'll do all the dishes tonight after dinner.\" or something like that. Or, \"Hey would it be okay if I get the vacuuming done while you walk the dog instead?\"", "Nta.  You don't have to like the dog.", "NTA. You\u2019re a person. You are allowed to like what you like and dislike what you dislike. Everyone has the right to be or to not be a \u201cdog person\u201d. Having said that, as a teenager, you\u2019re more or less in a spot where you have to comply to your parents\u2019 reasonable demands. Walking the dog is reasonable -except in this instance where you were not feeling well.\nYou should talk to your parents and instead of throwing what could appear like a tantrum to your parents every time they ask for your help with the dog, calmly explain what you just so eloquently wrote here.", "NTA for not wanting anything to do with the dog, I don\u2019t see why mom or your brother could get up and walking around the street or the backyard. But unfortunately as long as you live in that house you have no choice but to pitch in", "NTA.  Do your parents have any intention of ever training this thing?  A strong energetic dog like this really needs to learn to do what it's told.", "NTA but it also sounds like your parents are not good dog owners and aren't providing their dog with proper training, especially a border collie??", "NTA.  It doesn't sound like you neglect her at all when  she's in your care, and that matters.\n\nAs a member of a family, you do sometimes have to do chores that you don't like.  That may include walking the dog (but not when you're unwell), although I do love the poster who suggested you offer to do a different chore instead.  That makes far more sense.\n\nI personally wouldn't make you walk the dog seeing as you aren't a dog person.", "NTA. I don't mind dogs in general but I know I don't want one. You can't force people to like dogs. You're in a losing battle on this until you leave home OP. Parents house,  parents rule.  But your feelings are valid.", "NTA, you don\u2019t want the dog and didn\u2019t ask for it. It\u2019s not your pet so you don\u2019t have any responsibility for it. Dog owners who shirk their responsibilities and lay them on someone else are the aholes. But yeah, offer to do different chores instead of dog related ones and I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re just going to have to put up with the dog until you move out. I feel for you, I lived with a dog once, never again.", "NTA! Not everybody loves dogs. However, I would encourage your family to train the dog to not tug on the leash. There are different harnesses that help with this training. I suggest looking into them.", "Nta.", "ESH You are a minor. Your parents can get a dog even if you don't really like them, and it's perfectly reasonable to ask you to help out with things like walks. In this case, you weren't feeling well so it wasn't fair to expect you to go walk the dog.", "YTA the dog is a member of your family\u2026I may not have liked my sister when I was a kid but I dealt with it.", "NTA , you don\u2019t like dogs simple. Personally I don\u2019t get it I would be lost without my little ginger crazy poodle he is my life , but I never act that other people in my home should feel the same way towards him, if he jumps up I tell him off and apologise- most of my friends r fine around dogs so it doesn\u2019t upset or make them nervous, but still some people especially kids don\u2019t feel comfortable around them what is completely fine", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not even close. The parents and brother can consider the dog family sure, but they can\u2019t get an animal they know their child doesn\u2019t want and still expect that child to act like the dog is theirs too. This is like if mom got a new boyfriend and now OP has to treat them like a regular parent. And even, for the sake of argument, that the dog IS family to OP; OP still shouldn\u2019t be expected to take care of it just like they shouldn\u2019t be expected to change their infant siblings diaper or bathe their siblings or make food for their sibling with any regularity. Those are parental responsibilities.
