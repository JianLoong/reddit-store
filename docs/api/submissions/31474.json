I was an only sister (or so I thought) My whole life until I was around 26 when I found out that my dad had cheated on my mom 14 years prior and she got pregnant. My mom was heartbroken to say the least but let my Half sister (14F at the time, 22F now) live with us since she had gotten kicked out. (When I say with us I mean me and my parents because I lived in their attic because I was attending college, and yes I paid rent) She was a terror, They got into arguments daily and I never could focus on my work.  She also for some reason had a hatred for me even though I never did anything to her, she used to steal my credit card and when I caught her with it she would deny it.

They are individuals that will become completely separate and unique from their parents if given the opportunity to do so. A decision like this reinforces the family dynamics that you don't seem to like. You could have multiple flower girls if you wanted to.
