They're ideal vacation was: no work, no responsibilities, no kids, just spending quality time together. \n\nThey sent the kids to grandparents for 4 days,  rented an nice hotel room in the same town they live in, and went to the local attractions, museums, music, diffrent resturants they havent been to.

No. All of that is a dependency on alcohol. None of it is okay. It took her leaving me and filing for divorce before I finally stopped drinking completely. I\u2019m 10 months sober now and it took maybe the first 6 months of sobriety before I even recognized that what I was exhibiting was alcoholism.

Best thing I have ever done for myself is telling him: \u201cI\u2019m done with the bs, don\u2019t call me again unless it\u2019s from rehab\u201d.", "[Almost nobody in the USA drinks every day, certainly not *more than one drink*.](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-top-10-percent-drink-way-more-than-you-think.html)\n\n40% of Americans drink virtually *nothing*, perhaps one or two alcoholic beverages during the entire year.\n\nAnother 20% drinks about one to three drinks a month.\n\nYour husband has deluded himself into thinking that his drinking is normal. It's not. He is quite a heavy drinker, and he's clearly *reliant* on drinking.", "As someone who has struggled with alcohol due to depression myself, not getting drunk every time or even that often but drinking a few beers or wine glasses every day can still cause cirrhosis of the liver and heart issues. \nHe has a problem. And the only thing that's been slightly helping me is therapy. I've been learning to hate booze and have a long road myself. But there might be something more deeply emotional there that's causing him to turn to alcohol.\nBut I'll tell you this. He's not going to quit for you. Be prepared to leave the relationship. He will choose alcohol over you. If for some reason he doesn't, and he chooses to seek help, I think it's worth fighting for unless he goes off the major deep end again.", "The *quantity* of his consumption is not the issue.  If alcohol use is damaging your job, health, *relationships*, etc., then you have an alcohol problem.", "Do you know what happens when my husband gets drunk? He tells everyone he loves them. On the rare occasion he would get sick, he would apologize profusely for the trouble. Your husbands drinking is a problem by itself. But his behavior while drinking is an even bigger red flag.", "Spot on.  Hopefully OP takes this to heart and doesn't waste any more time.", "I\u2019ve been here. Thankfully not married. You are so right.", "Yeah same, I used to go out drinking a lot at uni, I drink maybe 1 or 2 times a year now. I don\u2019t mind being sober around my drunk friends because they\u2019re happy and chilled, if anything it\u2019s pretty fun. If someone acted like OPs husband I\u2019d have a serious talk with them/dial back the relationship", "How did he hide 72 beers (3 cases) a week? Does he have a workshop or something else where he's away from you during his off work time?", "I also drank 2-3 beers every day for nearly a decade. \n\nStopped because I felt it ruined my health and enabled me to not face my problems.\n\nNow drinking 2-3 beers every other week - works well for quite some years now - including times of emotional hardship.\n\nYou just need to know why and how to change something - but your right in so far that pressure from outside might not do the trick.", "He might - but he almost certainly won't change if nothing forces him to admit he needs to change.", "My wife drinks about a half a white claw a night and the biggest issue is her leaving the can out when she goes to bed lol.", "> Having a beer or even two each night isn't a problem.\n\nIt's not a problem in and of itself, no - but it's also not normal. Having a six or more drinks a week puts you in the 80th percentile for alcohol consumption in the USA.", "Yes, he's freaking out about not drinking because he knows he'll have profuse sweating and shaky hands and will have these adverse effects at work tomorrow.", "Just so you see this: another commenter and I strongly recommend al-anon to help you navigate whatever choices you make. It's a life saver", "This is what I've been doing. I've never been an angry drunk like OPs man, but my liver is starting to struggle. Even though I cut down massively, it's getting to the point I can't have any booze. It's a struggle for sure. It sounds like you cut down early on so I'm happy for you! Have one for me. \ud83d\ude06", "I'd be annoyed about the wasted half each night!", "She definitely gets annoyed when I used my dad voice and say things like \u201clet\u2019s remember to clean up after ourselves.\u201d Or stick it in the fridge and tell her we shouldn\u2019t be wasteful and to drink that before she opens a new one."]}
