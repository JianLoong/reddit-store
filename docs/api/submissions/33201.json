Al-anon can be helpful and you can find support there with others in the same situation (you can also do this online). He\u2019s gotta hit his bottom and you have to LET HIM CRASH. This is so difficult for family members. It is a family disease that touches everyone\u2026family, career and eventually the law (cops could have been called at your resort so you dodged a bullet there). Save yourself first, so when he is ready you are prepared for the rebuilding of a life with the sober person (harder than you may think). Encourage his parents to get educated.  You likely will see patterns and ways he has been enabled to continue without severe consequences. Start counseling if you can. I cannot stress this enough\u2026it is imperative that you understand clearly the dynamics of this disease and how to take care of yourself. It absolutely is possible for all to overcome this but you need tools, support and a strong resolve to set boundaries (parents, siblings, friends included) and hold the line.  Best of luck.", "nta. take video/pics of how he's acting. show them to him and maybe  he can see how big of a dumb fuck he has been. \n\nif he denies his drinking problem, then what else can you do?\n\nmaybe he doesn't realize how aweful he is and should be shown?\n\n(also will be good evidence for what is to come if he is not going to change his drinking habits)", "Your husband is an alcoholic.
