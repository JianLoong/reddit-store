I hate everyone in my grade, they\u2019re all racist, homophobic, and inappropriate. I\u2019m also not currently in school because I\u2019m sick (a manageable chronic disease, but I\u2019m mostly fine as of now, just super exhausted)\n\nI threw out other ideas, such as a weeklong Disney trip, a fancy spa day with a few friends, etc. My dad was ok with it all, and so I started researching prices for it all. A week at Disney is 5-7k, and a nice spa day for multiple people is 2-4k (he wanted to do a massive, fancy spa day at a nice hotel) \n\nI still wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted, until I thought about a horse. I haven\u2019t been exercising or outside in weeks, and even though I\u2019ve lost around 30 pounds from not eating (illness) I\u2019m still slightly over the weight I want to be. I decided to do research on boarding here, jobs, and horses available near me. I found that if I got a job, I could easily pay for the boarding, which is only 200-450 where I am, and that I would be able to go on trails and rides almost daily. \n\nThe horses I was looking at cost around 600-6k depending. \n\nMy dad shut me down immediately, saying I need to grow up and be less childish with my goals. However I think if I\u2019m willing to get a job, and care for a horse, that\u2019s more responsible than going to a week at Disney, where I would be constantly feeling nauseous, or having a party I don\u2019t want. \n\nHe even said he would get me a car at 16, but I don\u2019t have a permit nor want to drive yet, so it would be a worthless waste of money for at least another year or two. Then I asked if he would buy me a dirt bike or motorcycle, since he and his family all ride and he wants me to, which I do not. \n\nHe said yes, and I just stopped texting him. \n\nI feel like if he\u2019s willing to drop thousands of dollars on something I DONT want or WONT use, he should just let me help pay for something I will use and enjoy. \n\nI also took lessons for years, on and off, and can gallop without assistance, plus jump tiny hurdles, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never ridden or been near horses, I\u2019ve wanted one forever but never asked before. \n\nAITA for not just accepting something I he wants to give me but won\u2019t enjoy or use?", "created_utc": 1676584452, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1142959/aita_for_wanting_a_horse/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Paying for boarding is just a tiny bit of ownership. Having riding lessons isn't enough. Choose something other than a living thing.", "How about before you get your own horse, you volunteer at the stable to take care of a horse for a year or two so you know what you\u2019re *actually* getting into?", "Let's say you get the horse.  What happens once you graduate high school?\n\nYTA simply because a horse is a huge responsibility and you don't seem to realize that.", "YTA\n\nI used to compete in equestrian endurance, I spent 5 years taking lessons 3 x a week. I don\u2019t think you understand the expense and responsibility of owning a horse. Buying the horse is the cheap part, maintaining the horse is incredibly expensive even if nothing goes wrong. You\u2019re not a trainer or even an experienced rider, you\u2019re going to need training for both you and the horse, the horse will need training to correct things you\u2019ve taught it that are wrong or dangerous. If you take lessons your skills will improve to the point that within a couple of years the horse will not be what you want or need. You\u2019re going to need shoes, equipment, supplements and other monthly expenses. You need to ride your horse 3-4 times a week. How are you going to get to the barn without a car or license? Will you be at a facility that has trails or will you need to trailer out? Cheap horse trailers are thousands and you\u2019ll need a good vehicle and the skills to drive a rig. What happens when you go to college? What happens when you get a boyfriend? What happens if you get injured? I was training a new horse for endurance, he bolted from a standstill, bucked me off, trampled me and I spent 5 days in the hospital, almost died, have permanent brain damage (I was wearing a Tipperary helmet) and the total hospital bill were $150,000. I had to still pay board and sent my horse off for professional training, for 6 months it was $10,000. He needed more training so he spent 3 months in Oregon working cattle. He then broke my back in 4 places and I had to give him away rather than euthanasia which was my only option unless I found the perfect home. What happens if something happens to your horse? Do you have the money to pay for vet bills? Do you know what colic looks like? Do you know enough to prevent your horse from getting laminitis or founder? Colic surgery is $15,000-$20,000 and your horse will never be the same. Horses are wonderful but it doesn\u2019t sound like you have the maturity and knowledge to own one.  \n\nTake lessons and start with a partial lease, don\u2019t bring a living animal with complex care into the mix that you don\u2019t understand how to care for.\n\nThe PASB in my user name stands for Polish Arabian Stud Book, horses are the biggest commitment you can make other than having children.", "**YTA-** Honestly, I hope this is a satirical post, because this is one of the most *entitled* things I have ever read in my entire life. \n\nYou're talking about the difference between a commitment that's going to last probably half your lifetime, vs all the other multitude of things that he's willing to get you. \n\nYou have SO MANY options that are being handed to you, and you are doubling down on desperately wanting a giant animal that requires excessive care, feeding, boarding, and exercise for the next 20-30 years???\n\nI *have* to believe this post is satire, for my own sanity.", "There's not just the one-off cost with a horse, there's stabling, feeding, vet bills, they need constant care and that does not come cheap.", "YTA do you know how much work a horse is, that's not a birthday gift.\n\nAlso, you can't afford a horse with a teenage job, their housing is expensive, their food is so expensive, the vet bills are ridiculous", "Yes YTA.\n\nI'm saying this as someone who has horses. I love them. I WISH more people were equestrians. \n*But* you're not asking for one thing. You're asking for *years and years* of vet, farrier, dentist, chiropractors, training, lessons, feed, hay, tack, supplies, etc the list goes on *and on.*\n\n Sure, board can be cheap depending but you know what never is? Colic surgery. What causes colic? Literally anything. \nHorses are SO EXPENSIVE. if you want a horse, ask to lease one. Do not ask your parent to buy one. When you're an adult, you can buy one. Even then I recommend leasing first.", "INFO: do you frequently horse ride and do you have a deep knowledge of horse care? I'm not asking whether you have ridden, I'm asking whether you have rode 2-3 times a week every week for the last year/two years, whether you have a reliable and independent way of getting to the stables, and whether you can afford an unexpected vet bill of over 5k.\n\nAnd whether you would be okay paying for a horse's upkeeping for 20-30 years in the case it has an issue which makes it unrideable \n\nA horse is way way more difficult than having a puppy. A dog's training you can half ass and still end up with a good dog. You mess up a horse's training/care and you could end up with an unrideable horse or with a severe accident.", "YTA\n\nHorses are a shit ton (literally) of work.", "The abilities to \u201cgallop without assistance\u201d and \u201cjump tiny hurdles\u201d do not prepare you to own a horse. Horses are expensive. Boarding for 450 does not cover their expenses. You must think about bedding, farrier care, tack, vet bills, feed, mucking, etc. Even doing a full care board (meaning travelling to the barn multiple times a day to feed, water, and much) you\u2019d spend a minimum of $600 a month on care alone. You are not prepared to ride a horse without lessons and a trainer, so add those costs as well. I currently own three horses and have spent over $10,000 this year on vet bills alone - including euthanizing a horse, which isn\u2019t cheap either.\n\nIf you are interested in horses and want to spend more time with them as a birthday gift, ask for lessons or possibly a lease on a horse.", "INFO\n\nSo this is what rich people are like, huh?", "YTA.  So, let me get this straight...your dad is willing to drop $7k for you to go to Disney world, but that's not enough for you?  Damn...rich people problems.  Also, horses are a ton of work that you haven't seemed to think about.  What happens to the horse when you go to college or move away?", "Horses are expensive and a LOT of work. (Source: I trained and competed for over 20 yrs)\n\nThere isn't just the board to consider. You will also need \u2014\n\n* Tack. Bridle, saddle, pads, girth, halter, lead, lunge rope.\n* Proper boots and a helmet.\n* Brushes and pics!\n* Depending on where you live, blankets.\n\nNone of the above are cheap.\n\nThen there are the ongoing costs \u2014\n\n* Grain (most boarding places do not supply).\n* Farrier every four to six weeks. \n* Dewormer twice per year.\n* Teeth floating once per year.\n* Annual vaccinations. \n* ... and probably a lot of stuff I am forgetting. \n\nNo judgement here. NTA for wanting a horse. YWBTA for getting one without understanding what you're getting into. \n\nEdit ~~I would suggest either lessons to start, or possibly a part boarding situation.~~ Re-read your post, part boarding would be the way to go. \n\n\n[Horse tax for you all.](https://imgur.com/rFUrGD7.jpg)\n\n[Another pic.](https://imgur.com/FcvjlHJ.jpg)\n\n[And one more.](https://imgur.com/aoxgqOq.jpg)", "It\u2019s not just the cost of buying it, it\u2019s the cost of upkeep.  Do more research.  YTA", "YTA. If you want a horse so badly, I suggest you get a job at a stable FIRST. Work there for six months and see how you feel about owning a horse after that, because everything you will do is what goes into caring for a horse. Sign up for riding lessons again, and do that for six months solid as well. You're probably a little out of practice.\n\nDo your research. Look up common horse health problems and talk to some vets about how much they cost, and do the same sort of research on feed and tack. See how much you get paid for your job, and make a budget for monthly care. Compare and contrast.\n\nI *know* you want a horse. But lessons on and off are not the same thing as actually caring for a horse day in, day out. And as other people have mentioned, what would you do with your horse when you go off to college? Horses can live for a couple of decades, so plan accordingly. And they are living creatures that thrive on interaction - you can't just board him and go out once a week.\n\nMatter of fact, since you don't drive, how do you plan to get out to the stable every day? Your parents are going to be busy, and may not want to drive you back and forth that often.\n\nMy sister has a horse. I know how much work goes into keeping them happy and healthy. This isn't a \"present\". It's a serious commitment. After you've put in the work and effort, your dad may be more likely to consider it. Right now you just sound like a little girl who wants a pony, with no practical idea of what that *really* involves.", "I don't want to call a child an AH, but I don't think you've thought this through properly. A horse can be a 30 year commitment, I don't think anyone at 16 is ready for that.\n\nYou say that you're not in school because of a chronic health condition, so if you can't go to school how do you expect to be able to hold down a job and also look after a horse, it's more than just horse riding. They need feeding, mucking out, cleaning etc. Who will this fall to if your illness flares up and you can't get to the stables?\n\nHave you taken into account how you will pay for any vet bills, this will likely run into $1000's. How will you get to the stables every day if you don't drive? Will you have to be relying on other people giving up their time to take you?", "Within the first couple lines I could declare you the asshole easily. \nYou label people in large swathes and have no idea about personal responsibility and have clearly done little to no research into the care, housing, and costs of owning a horse because those numbers your presented are not realistic. \nAlso if you can't attend school you definitely will not attend work to pay for this.", "We lived on a property where our landlord had horses (she lived next door). One day her stallion got spooked by ??? (Air maybe) and ran through the fence. Ended up costing her over $70k in vet bills because due to the stress he got an infection. This lady was applying creams, giving tablets, vet out twice a week. She had been raising horses since she was little, father was a trainer etc. Even with all of her experience she ended up having to have him put down because he just would not get better. This horse was a trained dressage horse worth over $20k. He was 3 when he was put down.\n\nWhat did I learn from this? Horses are fragile, finnicky creatures that should only be owned by those who are properly trained and have the ability to drop hundreds of thousands on them in a heartbeat.\n\nEdit: YTA.

And who\u2019s gonna pay for vet care? Shodding? Horse gets sick who\u2019s paying for meds? You pay extra for traveling vets (assuming you don\u2019t have a truck and trailer to haul them). Who\u2019s gonna muck the stalls? Feed the horse? Groom the horse? When you\u2019re too sick to do it? \n\nThe horse\u2019s care never stops. You\u2019re too sick? Too bad.

That would do more good", "YTA\n\nLMAO Varuca Salt", "As someone who also has a chronic illness that leaves me exhausted 95% of the time I cant even imagine wanting to care for a living creature thats bigger than me.

However, I will say that there's little to no way that you'll be able to make a strong case for getting a horse at 16.\n\nGetting a horse is not just about paying for boarding. It's also about paying for medical bills when it's sick, buying equipment for boarding, as well as spending a lot of time ensuring the health and safety of your horse. These are things that also are there for cars too, but when it comes to a living thing, there's a lot more unpredictability about what/when things can go wrong. Once you buy a horse, you also have to think about whether you'll take it with you if you move after highschool, and how easy it is to sell a horse if you no longer want to take care of it. There's a lot of variables that you and your family may not know about as people who haven't owned horses before. It's likely going to come with a lot of unforeseen challenges that's hard to manage at 16.", "You\u2019re exhausted but you want to take care of a horse all the time?", "Sorry but I think YTA. Not for *wanting* a horse but for your petty behavior when not getting your way.

Yes, you can get a job but as you are 15 and probably won\u2019t make enough to cover all of the expenses.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you just ask for more lessons instead? Or get a part time job at the horse stable to prove that you can be responsible and it\u2019s really something you want, not just a passing fancy.", "I don't want to call you an AH because I remember sitting with listings for quarter horses every week and thinking I could pay for feed and boarding myself with my job when I was in HS. \n\nI was 18 and already had a job, and just needed the horse. I was so dead set on it.\n\nHowever, I got sick of my job and my interests changed. I am glad I didn't get a horse then.\n\nI did find another way to ride without owning a horse - I rode them to exercise them for owners who ignored their horses and couldn't get to stables. \n\nYou're not an AH, but you are not realistic with this birthday ask. I don't think your only options are a motorcycle that you'd hate and a horse that you'd love.\n\nBut feel free to continue to look for ways to ride, if that's what you want. I'll tell you - horses who need riders are very glad to get out and stretch their legs.", "YTA in the fact that a horse is a big responsibility and sure you know about riding them but it doesn't sound like you're in the best place to own one at this moment in time.  You've been sick and it sounds like you probably won't have the current energy to even take care of the horse.  What about having the energy to muck out the stalls, pay for someone to take care of the hoofs. Feeding it. Emergency vet bills? Money for brushes, correct bathing procedures.  \n\nYou say you'll get a job but if you're not even going to school right now because you're sick what happens if you get sick again and don't have the energy to go to work, lose your job etc etc.  Guess who'll have to step up and help? More than likely your dad and he probably knows a horse is a long term commitment with time and money if you fall through.  \n\nIf you don't like crowds then have something done at your house if you don't want to go out and miss your cousin because you went to Disney world or a hotel with a spa day.  Or maybe ask if you can hold the spay/hotel at a later date if you don't want to miss your cousin.  \n\nMaybe that'll be one of your goals in life is to save up for owning one once you're done with college and you know you're in a healthy place.", "YTA the only real question I have is could you possibly be more entitled if you tried? Go and have a think about what more intelligent people than me have said.", "YTA and holy shit, I thought the \u2018rich teen disconnected from reality to the clear chagrin of others\u2019 trope was exaggerated in media, but here we are", "YTA\n\nHorses are extremely expensive and time consuming.  Clearly your immaturity and inexperience is showing as you don't comprehend horse ownership.

This is a living being that needs a LOT of care.\n\nThen you graduate from school and move away and then what?  What happens to the horse.  It's not easy to rehome a horse, especially in a bad economy, which we are heading for.\n\nStart small and ask for money to go horseback riding.", "Soft YTA\n\nI always wanted a horse but my dad made me wait til I could get my license and that was the best thing he could\u2019ve done for me. Being there for the vet, farrier and being able to drive to the stables at any time is absolutely needed for owning a horse. I now have 3 horses and they take up my full day every day and I am broke broke. He is correct and you need to be more responsible I would suggest a loan or part loan so you get the experience of looking after a horse without the full responsibility and ability to stop if needed. On top of stabling and buying the horse you need probably hard feed, potential vet bills, monthly shoeing, physio, saddle fitting, buying tack and how are you going to go view horses without a car?\n\nA safe horse will be very expensive and probably what you need. If you can\u2019t go to school how are you going to look after a horse full time? They take a lot of work and time riding horses on and off for years is not the same as caring for one", "I bought my horse for $500. When he got sick, I spent $6 K to save his life. Horses are big and everything about them is expensive. You need to factor in medical care,( minimum vaccines and deworming much much more if they get sick or hurt, hoof care ( $60-150 every 6 weeks). 250-400 for board is very low. Is that for housing only or housing AND feed.\nWhat about in a few years when you are ready for college? What happens to the horse then!\n\nI understand wanting a horse. I\u2019m grew up wanting a horse more than anything. I didn\u2019t get one until o was 32 bc\u2014- horses are expensive. Even a free horse is expensive.\n\nI would recommend finding a horse to lease at a local barn. Many people with riding horses do partial leases where someone else rides their horse ( both to defray costs and get more exercise for their horse). If you are not an experienced rider, you\u2019d be. Much better off with a part lease and a few thousand dollars in riding lessons than buying a horse right now", "Judging by your verbiage, you sound like you actually don't know anything about horses.

Spoiled, entitled ah", "YTA. You aren\u2019t in school because of a chronic illness but you think you can easily work a job and make $450 a week after taxes? What happen when your horse needs a vet? Will you actually have time for and energy for daily rides if you are also working and in school? You seem to be seriously underestimating the commitment. Before getting a horse, you need to demonstrate that you can care for it. Get a job now and start saving up.

Like some other folks have pointed out, this is a privileged problem and also a responsibility for another intelligent creature with wants and needs that's possibly going to live for decades.  Check your privilege, learn some gratitude for what you have especially when you haven't earned it, and maybe take a look in the mirror if you're arriving at the conclusion that everyone else around you is \"racist, homophobic, and inappropriate\"", "YTA\n\nDude get a dog, I don\u2019t think your ready for the thousands it takes to keep a horse. \n\nLike cool, if your down with paying 50k a year for it.

I cleaned stalls and refilled water troughs and cleaned tack and dealt with veterinary and farrier expenses and fed them twice a day, and bought hay and grain and halters and blankets, and brushed and combed them, and worked so hard on keeping the horse alive and happy that I never, *ever*, had time to just go enjoy a trail ride. Which is no fun by yourself, btw. \n\nMany years later, I came to the conclusion that what I really had wanted was regular ride time at a local barn. Not the expense and physical labor of keeping a horse. Just time to enjoy one.  Maybe you could ask your dad for a certain number of rides, or more/better lessons, or something that doesn't require he spend the rest of forever with the expense of a horse.", "NTA because you are young and don\u2019t really understand what you\u2019re asking for, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily your fault because your parents should have done a better job teaching you about money, but this is an unreasonable request. \n\nHorses that are that cheap are likely not well trained, so you will need to hire a trainer, which can be astronomically expensive. You would also want to pay for lessons for yourself. Who will pay for regular and unexpected vet fees? Do you know how much a farrier is and how much shoes cost? What about tack (saddle, bridle, blankets, etc.)? A part time job will not cover all of these expenses. Plus you need to focus your energy on getting healthy and finishing school. Adding a job and a new horse on top of that would be a lot. I think a job and a hobby sound like great ideas, but start slow and build up to bigger goals.\n\nIf you want to get back into the horse world, you absolutely should. Horses are the best. But do it responsibly. Take lessons. Volunteer at a stable, clean out stalls, lead trail rides, bond with the school horses. Try to get a really good sense of what goes into owning and caring for one.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think you necessarily did anything wrong. Your dad sounds like he wants things to be his way or the highway, and he uses his money to get his way. Also sounds like he wants to show off to your schoolmates\u2019 parents that he can afford a huge party. He shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you when you asked for the horse. I understand your logic - if he\u2019s willing to pay X amount, why can\u2019t you suggest a different gift for a similar price? He should have explained to you how the price of a horse compounds over time, and he should also listen to you about what kinds of gifts you actually want, and not wanting to hang out with homophobes and racists (ew). I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s not taking your feelings and opinions into account.\n\nYour dad has a lot of money and is not teaching about personal finance, and that is going to give you a skewed perspective on the world. You sound smart. It\u2019s great that you did research into horses in your area and local boarding rates. I encourage you to start earning a paycheck, even if just a little, to teach yourself about budgeting and taxes and just to familiarize yourself with what it takes to hold down a job. But don\u2019t push yourself too hard - your health is your biggest priority! Happy Early Birthday!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m also not currently in school because I\u2019m sick (a manageable chronic disease, but I\u2019m mostly fine as of now, just super exhausted)\n\nI threw out other ideas, such as a weeklong Disney trip, a fancy spa day with a few friends, etc. My dad was ok with it all, and so I started researching prices for it all. A week at Disney is 5-7k, and a nice spa day for multiple people is 2-4k (he wanted to do a massive, fancy spa day at a nice hotel) \n\nI still wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted, until I thought about a horse. I haven\u2019t been exercising or outside in weeks, and even though I\u2019ve lost around 30 pounds from not eating (illness) I\u2019m still slightly over the weight I want to be. I decided to do research on boarding here, jobs, and horses available near me. I found that if I got a job, I could easily pay for the boarding, which is only 200-450 where I am, and that I would be able to go on trails and rides almost daily. \n\nThe horses I was looking at cost around 600-6k depending. \n\nMy dad shut me down immediately, saying I need to grow up and be less childish with my goals. However I think if I\u2019m willing to get a job, and care for a horse, that\u2019s more responsible than going to a week at Disney, where I would be constantly feeling nauseous, or having a party I don\u2019t want. \n\nHe even said he would get me a car at 16, but I don\u2019t have a permit nor want to drive yet, so it would be a worthless waste of money for at least another year or two. Then I asked if he would buy me a dirt bike or motorcycle, since he and his family all ride and he wants me to, which I do not. \n\nHe said yes, and I just stopped texting him. \n\nI feel like if he\u2019s willing to drop thousands of dollars on something I DONT want or WONT use, he should just let me help pay for something I will use and enjoy. \n\nI also took lessons for years, on and off, and can gallop without assistance, plus jump tiny hurdles, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never ridden or been near horses, I\u2019ve wanted one forever but never asked before. \n\nAITA for not just accepting something I he wants to give me but won\u2019t enjoy or use?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Food costs money, saddles and tack, housing it, and shoeing it all cost money. Not even counting the vet bills trying to keep them healthy.

Why not ask your dad for more riding lessons, so you get the joy of experiencing that, without the responsibility and upkeep of owning a horse?", "yta a horse need more than money for his maintenaince hi needs a big amount of time that you forget to include in the cost for have this horse. And its not a little amount of time .", "Yta you sound extremely spoiled and close minded what\u2019s gonna happen when you get bored of the horse who\u2019s gonna take care of them the sooner or later I bet that you\u2019ll get bored of them like you do with everything else in your life. And if you think that everyone seems to be the problem in your school maybe you should look in the mirror cause normally you\u2019re the problem.", "YTA.\n\nNot necessarily because you asked your dad for a horse, but because you're failing to put the needs of this prospective future horse ahead of your own desires, which already does not bode well for your horse.\n\nI got my horse, an OTTB, when I was done with college. That means I had no other responsibilities aside from working and making money.\nYou are 16. You do not have a car. I don't know if you have a job, but if you DO have a part-time job, it will not pay enough for you to sustain a horse month to month on top of school and that's a promise. \nI do not have rich family to fall back on and was entirely self sufficient in the purchasing of my gelding, and had leased and ran in a lesson program for a while, but even I was thrown by some of the random things I hadn't factored into the costs. \n\nThere's vet work, farrier every 4-6 weeks, board...\n\nBut what if your horse has poor feet and throws a shoe that needs replacing every other week in the dry months? What if he colics? Needs teeth floated? Chiro/acupuncture/massage? Saddle fitting? Lessons (and yes, you absolutely need to take lessons no matter how proficient of a rider you think you are. Every horse owner should want to leave their horse in a better state than they got it should something ever happen to them and their horse is released into society. Don't mess up your horse.) \nI understand your POV of \"if all this money is being spent, spend it on something I actually want\" but this isn't JUST a birthday present... This is a commitment for the next 3 decades, and your father should not have to be responsible for that. \nHell... I would be mad at my parents if they did the cheap part of buying me a horse and then saddled(lol) me with all of the bills and expenses that comes after.\nPretty shitty present.\n\nI don't think you should give up on wanting a horse, this sport has saved my life and if you're passionate about it then by all means- hold onto it. \nBut why not ask your dad for some lessons instead, or MAYBE if he's willing, lease a horse. It's closer to owning without the actual responsibility.", "Wow. This is like an episode of My Sweet 16.", "YTA.", "YTA. Part of me thinks this is fake because nobody is this naive. \n\nNo offence kid but you need a reality check. I make well into the 6 figures and owning a horse is still expensive for me. Last year my vet bills alone were 12k with insurance because horses love to hurt themselves and get sick.\n\nJust to give you some examples (I could write an additional novel). \n\nMy perfectly healthy horse went lame from simply running around and doing horsey things in her pasture. Her out of pocket bills for her recovery was over 6k with insurance. \n\nLast year we found out she had stomach ulcers, which is insanely common. 8k to treat plus her 3 months of medicine cost $60 a day. Switching her to a new food cost me an additional $130 a month. \n\nBasic equipment alone will run you several thousands of dollars as an up front cost. My used saddle was 3.5k. Bridle was $300. Girth was $250, Helmet $500. This doesn't include all other tack, equipment, riding clothes, boots, horse blankets, etc. Lessons will run you about $50 but most trainers are charging more these days. \n\nHow are you actually going to get the horse to the barn? If you don't own your own trailer, shipping will run you hundreds of dollars. Potentially thousands depending on where you get the horse. \n\nMost horses need a trim and shoes every 4-6 weeks. That will cost you a minimum of $200 each time. Horses love to throw shows. Emergency call out to have them replaced will cost you dearly. \n\nMy yearly cost JUST TO MAINTAIN (without the unforeseen issues like vet bills) is over 20k and that's fairly typical in the 2023 market. \n\nYou're probably not going to find a job that pays above minimum wage at your age and you certainly won't be working full time so realistically you can expect to make 10-15k a year before tax (if you're lucky). \n\nI wouldn't plan on being able to maintain horse ownership for long because you're only factoring in the bare minimum expenses when the reality is that you are guaranteed to go well over your budget every single year. Since you're not an experienced horse owner, there are probably a ton of hidden costs you're not even aware of that haven't factored into your estimate. Assuming nothing goes wrong, I'd give it 6 months to a year max. You need to be able to have at least 5k in disposable money saved at any given time in case you need to pay for something unforseen. I personally wouldn't be comfortable with less than 10k\n\nThe other thing to add is that you need to be healthy and physically fit to do basic riding. Maybe you can just walk your horse around or whatever but trotting and cantering takes core strength, stamina, and balance. If you are chronically I'll, and find it difficult to walk around as you've stated, riding will not be easy.\n\nThe smart option would be to take lessons at a local barn and see if it's even possible for you to ride with your health.", "YTA\n\nYou still arent being realistic.\n\nAt some point you are more than likely going to be required to move out when youre older, and apartments will not let you take a horse with you. You also more than likely would not be able to save for a house let alone get a mortgage for one, while affording for the care of a horse, especially getting large enough space for it to run around in. Theres also the fact that horses are sociable and do better with at least one other horse with it. So double the price to take care of them.\n\nThen youre also not taking into account vet costs, which can be extraordinarily high in comparison to smaller animals like dogs. Honestly a better request wouldve been a dog instead of a horse, but even then, you more than likely wont be able to afford to care for it while paying rent and bills and insurance and vet bills and all the other fun adult stuff.\n\nIm sorry, Im a new adult, 21, so Ive been in your shoes. The reality is.... it's not happening.", "YTA OP you don't understand the responsibility a horse brings. They aren't like a dog or a cat. If you can't handle walking during a trip, you cannot handle all of the physical demands a horse brings.\n\nSource: I've had them before", "I was lucky I got to have a birthday party for my 16th, YTA delusional and entitled", "Yep YTA. \n\nYou talked about having problems with walking and exercise in general because of the chronic illness. Well you should know that a horse need a shit ton of exercise. If you can\u2019t stay on your feet walking around Disney for a week then how are you going to manage riding, training and taking care of a horse DAYLY for around 20-30 YEARS. \n\nRiding lessons are a far better than buying a literal horse. I don\u2019t know anything about your pet owning history but if things are really as bad as you make it seem in your post you probably couldn\u2019t even handle a dog. Let alone a horse. \n\nI\u2019ve been around horses my whole life and I still wouldn\u2019t even dream about owning one of my own because I know It\u2019s something i couldn\u2019t handle. Horses are not your basic pets and the basic understanding of horses and riding doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nGet down from your high horse", "YTA... you haven't a clue about the full cost and work of horse ownership.  This is obviously a phase.... Prove it. Spend a year saving first, if you have considerable saving and been consistent in your goals for that long, then maybe", "YTA. Start with lessons on the barn horse a few times a week. \n\nYou\u2019re wanting to go from 0-60 in 1 second, you can\u2019t afford a horse, 450 a month isn\u2019t nearly enough, vet bills are a thing and I don\u2019t think you have $6-10k squirreled away somewhere, you aren\u2019t experienced enough to own a horse.. omg so many things. Poodlebum - you wouldn\u2019t get a set of insane golf clubs if you mentioned wanting to start golfing, you need to start much smaller and go from there - once you\u2019ve been riding for two years, mucking stalls at the barn every day, obsessing over ponies 24/7, catching rides whenever you can, *then* you can talk to your parents about buying a pony.

That\u2019s board, farrier, supplements, and regular vet appointments (averaged across 12 months).\n\nOne year I spent an additional $15k in vet bills.\n\nAnd I still have other expenses like lessons, new helmet ($300+) when I crash, replacement reins/leathers, new boots, saddle pads, and new turn out blankets when my horse shreds it again \ud83d\ude44", "YTA because you keep making excuses in your comments without actually listening to what anyone has to say. You can't go to school because of XYZ. What makes you think you can go to work part-time? Because of XYZ, that's not how the real world works.

Ask your dad for riding lessons for 6 months or a year instead.", "YTA and need a reality check bad", "i don\u2019t think you understand how expensive horses are. horse feed alone can cost like $5000 a year. & the amount of money it takes to maintain a working stable is insane, i think it cost my parents like $1000 to fix a barn door that broke. and it costs like $1000 to get all the tack you need. and that\u2019s not even adding on vet bills. do you know how much it cost to take care of a horse with a hurt leg? horses are crazy expensive. it\u2019s not realistic to expect you to make all that money on your own, and it\u2019s not fair to your parents to cut the bill if you can\u2019t do it.", "YTA. If you\u2019re too sick to go to school, you\u2019re too sick to haul hay at the stable.. or work. If you don\u2019t show up for work, you get fired. \nAsk for lessons instead, and see how you do. Ask for mucking boots and volunteer at the stable.

Gently YTA.\n\nPeople here are forgetting that you are 15 years old with limited experience around finances and budgeting.\n\nOther folks here have made excellent points already about the workload expected with a horse and that with your chronic pain it is unlikely you will be able to manage a job if you are unable to go to school.\n\nMy suggestion as above is ask for riding lessons and get your driver's permit. Driving is such a privilege and gives you freedom.\n\nAsk at a local stables if you can help out there with other people's horses and learn everything you can, you may also meet new people and make friends. It will get you out the house and exercise but it it's unpaid then no big commitments.\n\nI wish you all the best and hope that you achieve your dream of owning a horse one day. Please me mindful that this is an unachievable dream for a lot of people, and some humility around your privileged circumstances will serve you well in the future.", "Not just '1st world problems' but 'upper class, whiney rich 1st world kids problems'.

That way if you get sick, the horse can revert back to its owner.", "A very gentle YTA, though I think it's more 'you're naive' than 'you're an AH'. \n\nI understand you think you've got a plan, but you really, really haven't thought this through -- and it's understandable, because at your age, it's hard to really conceptualize things like 'major, ongoing expenses' and 'responsible for this for the next decade or two or more'. I don't know shit about horses, but please listen to the people here who do -- it's a huge, massive responsibility. Also, trust me, however much you think you'll be making at whatever job you can get, it'll be much less.\n\nI think for now, the better option would be to ask for riding lessons again or horse camp or something along those lines. Owning a horse is just a bad idea for a lot of reasons, and your dad is not being an AH for being willing to buy you a machine versus a living, breathing animal.", "YTA there are so many ongoing expenses and if you\u2019re too unwell to make it to school then you\u2019ll probably be too unwell to make it to work and hold down a job.", "YTA. If you had a job, and showed that you were capable of paying for and taking care of a very expensive animal, then maybe it would be reasonable. The fact is you are 16, and a horse is a long commitment (I had horses growing up but I lived in the country). \n\nYour father is kind enough to spoil you with things that most kids would dream of having. A car for example would give you freedom and would allow you to GET a job that isnt right near your home, AND would allow you transportation to college in a few years. You may not have a permit YET but you will need a car eventually. Work towards getting the permit\n\nDont be ungrateful for what you are given.", "YTA\n\nI had a pony phase I never quite grew out of. I joined a horsemanship group on facebook because I wanted to see pretty pictures of ponies. Oh, here was a picture of a pretty horse running. Here's a dressage video. Here's a photo of an absolutely lovely OTTB thriving in his forever home. Here is a picture of a gentle mustang *with an entire deer antler shoved up its ass.* Apparently his owner put him out without inspecting every single inch of the paddock, and the horse went for a roll in the grass, and landed on the antler. Then there was the video of the horse whose owner forgot a piece of tack, so they looped the reigns into a tree and went into the barn to get the thing. In that short amount of time the horse managed to jam its hoof into the V at nose height, panicked and *ripped its own fucking leg off.* I think it popped off at the cannon joint. There were the many, many, *many* farrier videos of treating thrush and white line disease. Imagine strawberry jam and custard, only it's not jam and custard, it's copious amounts of blood and pus, dripping slowly off the infected hoof while the farrier carves out the diseased parts.\n\nHorses are lovely and majestic and absolutely fucked over by evolution. They cannot breathe through their mouths, which is problematic because they absolutely can manage to impale their nose on their own feed bucket. They cannot vomit, which is why an upset tummy or an irritable bowel is a death sentence if left untreated. They are natural prey animals, which means if you spook one it can kill or seriously injure you. Another video from that same Facebook group showed someone walking his prize stud over to a fairly skittish mare, and the mare got spooked and kicked the stallion in the head. Instantly dead. One horse person told me that horse people own guns partially because sometimes it's not humane to wait for a vet. \n\nAnd that's not even the worst part. Wanna know what happens when a horse falls through the cracks? Google \"Dr Drip Horse\". Dr. Drip was a moderately successful race horse who got farmed out in the Off Track Thoroughbred program. Like most ex-racers he wasn't easy to keep, so he got rehomed. And rehomed. And rehomed. And while maybe the first couple people vetted the adopters, somebody eventually gave him to his last owners. He was so emaciated he maxed out the assessment chart. There were very deep sores all along his backbone from being constantly ungroomed and in tack. Some of the wounds looked like he'd had battery acid poured on his back. His rescuers did all they could, but he ultimately had to be euthanized. So good animal husbandry isn't just about the animal's quality of life with you, but their quality of life when you can't care for them. So do you know where you could send a horse where they will be cared for if you can't do it anymore? A lot of horses have hard landings if their owners get sick, financially desperate, or die. And that goes double for the kind of cheap horses in that price range. That's backyard breeder kind of money, and that is not something anyone should support.\n\nIf you *really* want a horse, try volunteering at one of those boarding ranches, or better yet go to a horse sanctuary and sign up for all the stall mucking and *WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK* moments you can stand.\n\n And don't ask your dad to buy it. You want the animal, you put the cash down. If you cannot aquire and care for a horse on your own, you've got no business owning one.", "YTA - If you can't manage school, you can't manage the care of a horse let alone the costs.", "I\u2019m sorry to say this but, as someone who used to ride professionally and is now retired young from it due to chronic illness, you won\u2019t be able to properly care for and exercise a horse if you\u2019re so ill you can\u2019t go to school. Much less keep a job and ride daily. Even if you were 100% healthy I\u2019d suggest taking riding lessons for awhile, then do a partial lease, for a few years before getting your own horse. It\u2019s a huge commitment to get into and you won\u2019t even know how to choose the right horse & boarding facility as a beginner. So, start with once a week lessons. See how your health holds up and how you like it. Go from there.\n\nThe other issue here is that buying a horse so young could financially cripple you if you treat him ethically. What I mean is, let\u2019s say he gets hurt and can no longer be ridden. You now own a pasture ornament who still costs a lot of money and who you need to care for for the next 20 years, all while you\u2019re chronically ill and trying to go to college and then get established as a young adult. If you give him away when he can\u2019t be ridden anymore that\u2019s unethical. You  can sell a horse if they\u2019re healthy but career ending injuries occur rather easily, so you should always be prepared to take on a commitment as long as the natural life of the horse.\n\nI don\u2019t really want to give an AH judgement since you\u2019re so young but your dad is right.", "A horse isn\u2019t a pet or a whim.

Even if you can afford board, it won't cover supplements, tack, shoes, vet bills, training, and lessons.\n\nThirdly, to get to your job and to the stable, you will need a car. So take your dad up on driving lessons and the car, then worry about the job and the horse.\n\nLastly, if you CAN go to school, can work part time, and can drive yourself around, AND you still have energy to spare, then you can look into spending your income on a partial lease where you're responsible for the horse just a few days a week.\n\nAnd if you're able to maintain all your responsibilities while partially leasing a horse, and you have income to spare, THEN you worry about owning a horse. \n\n(This is from the perspective of someone who owned a horse in high school and also worked part time, btw.)", "OP cannot take care of herself. She cannot take care of a horse. \n\nIt\u2019s cruel to get a horse that\u2019s not treated right and then just abandoned. \n\nCurrently OP doesn\u2019t go to school and walking Disney world is exhausting.

Excellent idea.", "I\u2019m most likely going to college in town, and my stepbrother who\u2019s 6, wants a horse too, so by the time I go to college, he will be 10-12, and I would be able to help him learn about them, and care for them. I\u2019m not saying I would pin it onto him, but he learn.", "OP added in comments that they don't want to go on a trip because of their illness and the walking required. I don't know what kind of riding OP did before, but I would gently say that if you're too sick to walk around Disney world, you're too sick to be responsible for a horse. (I say this as a chronically ill former horse owner. I understand how hard it can be to let go of horses in general, and of things you loved doing when you were well specifically.) I also question how feasible the job part really is, depending on what types of jobs are available for a teen in OP's area. It's very normal and understandable in chronic illness to get enthusiastic about what we hope we could do, or feel we should be able to do, and then have to be reminded the hard way that we weren't doing it already for a reason. \n\nMaybe OP really can ride like they used to - chronic illness is weird like that! - but can they do barn chores like hauling buckets of water and hay bales and wheelbarrows around? Grooming? Walking the horse if it gets injured and needs long term recovery? Handling it if the horse spooks on said walk? (I speak from experience! 17'2\" Irish thoroughbred with a strained tendon who was pissy and antsy from stall rest.) If OP can do that on a good symptoms day, what happens when a bad day inevitably comes?\n\nOP, if you really want to get back into horses, I think lessons and/or a lease at a local barn would be a much safer option for you and for the hypothetical horse. That way you have fewer responsibilities, and if it doesn't work out, it's very easy to disentangle yourself. You could ask your dad to pay for this as a gift; the thousands of dollars you're talking about would cover several weeks at least.", "Not to mention how long of a commitment a horse can be.

I hope you are doing better!", "This is an excellent comment.

I'm sure she knew, but I didn't know that it would be YEARS before she could ride him. Of course she's still responsible for all of his care.

I'm not sure what happened, but some time between her signing the lease and getting the horse, it's suddenly got medical issues (a couple that seem unrelated to me). It's been a couple of months, but now she's out tens of thousands of dollars and STILL hasn't been able to ride her own horse. She can afford it and knew what she was getting into, but my broke ass hurts for her.

He took lessons since then. Going to university, he just dropped that because of the lack of time.

I\u2019m hypoglycemic and I\u2019ve had some scares just on a long trail ride, questioning if I would lose consciousness before I got back to the trailer where I had more energy bars. I ended up in the back of an ambulance because I got heatstroke on a ride in 75 degree weather. I was too sick to ride so my horse was ponied in by the nurse who found me puking water on the side of the trail, thank god I was at a competition. I was left with water and electrolytes while a side by side was sent for me. An hour in the back of the ambulance and the sheriff was still worried because I was grey. I had my inhaler give out 3 miles from the trailer and my horse didn\u2019t want to go. I felt like I was peddling him and posting made it so I couldn\u2019t breathe even worse. \n\n45 minutes in an arena 4 days a week is not enough exercise for most horses. My horse could and would do 55 miles in a day, I was training my baby to do Tevis which is 100 miles in under 24 hours. Even with full boarding and turnout a horse is a ton of exercise for even healthy people.", "They're ALWAYS looking for help. That would be amazing", "Yet again, what job are you getting while you are in college, or right out of college, that is going to pay you enough to cover the cost of a horse, plus your own living expenses? As an example for you, my yearly living expenses, on average, are about $40,000.  And that's just bills.  That's not including food, gas, fun money, doctors expenses, or unexpected expenses.  And that's on the low side.  And I don't have a horse.", "You DO NOT buy a horse to learn responsibility. The mistakes you make in that process would cause it to suffer. You need to learn about responsibility and accountability BEFORE you ever think about buying a dog, cat, horse..", "Info: why not ask for a year of riding lesson\u2019s instead? You really don\u2019t sound like you have a full grasp on just how much time and money it takes to care for a horse. \n\nWhat sort of job are you going to get as a teenager that can pay for all of the tack, supplies, and general upkeep like veterinary appointments and farriers? Do you know how to recognize disease, illness, or injury? Or how to prevent it? Or the cost of treating it? Could your chronic illness hinder your ability to work? Your ability to ride? Any possibility of that at all? Who will be taking care of the bills at that point? Who is going to be maintaining your horse if that happens? What happens when you get injured while riding (and I do mean **when**, not **if**. It\u2019s basically inevitable if you ride and more of a matter of how severe)? Ever been dumped while out on a hack? Even if you aren\u2019t injured, will you be able to walk back with your illness? You\u2019re planing on working, going to school, studying, and still finding time to train and ride? What about after you graduate? How are you getting to the barn? Don\u2019t say your Mom, this is your horse, not hers. And what about transportation for the horse? Training for you and your horse is still going to be necessary, even if you are just planning on taking it on hacks and not showing. Buying the horse (even a well trained one) is the cheap part. Boarding, while expensive- especially considering the feed prices right now- also isn\u2019t the most expensive part about owning and caring for a horse. I grew up with horses. My mom always had at least two Quarter Horses. My Grandma lived next to an Arabian breeder and I spent every summer, and many weekends throughout the year, on that farm riding and helping out around the barn. I\u2019m now a stable adult with a decent income. I don\u2019t have a horse. I\u2019ve seen the time and unexpected expenses over the years. I would love to have my own horse. But for now I prefer having friends that have horses (might be leasing in the future though!)", "This is insane. A horse is a settled adult commitment. \n\nThey do not let you keep horses at university. So what happens to the horse then? \n\nIt's a pet on steroids. Grooming...every day. Early mornings. Seven days a week. Mucking out. \n\nVet bills in the hundreds and thousands. Tack. Shoeing. Transport. \n\nI can't even. Horses, like boats, eat ALL the disposable income available. \n\nNTA... just delusional.", "You won\u2019t be able to pay the costs with a part time job, nowhere close.", "What job, as a sixteen year old, do you plan to get that will afford you that much money to blow on a horse?\n\nEspecially considering your health problems?", "I figured it was low when I typed it.  The price of me using google!  Haha", "Have you ever sold a horse? Selling a horse is not easy, takes time which costs you money and it can be expensive for a tune up and to have a trainer show the horse to a buyer. Horse bows a tendon or founders? Horse meat is $.45 cents a lb., dead serious.", "She can\u2019t even handle going to school, or walking around Disney World. She won\u2019t be able to get a job, or even tend to and ride the horse.", ">How is your comment helpful?\n\nThen what does this mean?", "> a horse, like boats\n\nLol. My very first thought when I read this post was that a horse is exactly like a boat. Better to have a friend with one than own one yourself.", "Delusional. That was my first thought.", "Depends on the university... mine had an equestrian team, so we had stables... food and board were crazy expensive, but since they were active riders and competed, it made sense in the long run to pay.", "There are universities where you can take a horse.", "Obviously this kid is delusional but why would going to university have an impact?", "Bro, she doesn\u2019t even go to school because she\u2019s too sick. How has it not gone through her head that she wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job and maintain it either?", "I had a friend who paid 25k a year for her two horses. OP has no idea what it will cost", "How does she learn anything, as in; what MAKES her the AH?", "Dunno why you got downvoted. My college had an eq team and I was one of the few girls on the team who didn't own a horse and keep it in the barn with the team's horses.", "Geez...yeah, I love horses, but it takes someone only in certain life circumstances to be able to afford it."]}
