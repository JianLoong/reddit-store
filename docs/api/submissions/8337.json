Don't break those boundaries, especially in your new long distance phase.  \n\nShe barely knows him.  \n\nShe has a history of nosing in on other people's relationships and have been shunned for it.    \n\nFor all of the reasons you state, it's inappropriate for her to even ask, much less get bent about a \"no\" answer.  \n\nETA:  \n> It almost feels like a friendship test that Henry and I both failed   \n\nNo, she failed her own \"friendship test\".   Anyone who does a \"friendship test\" immediately fails in my estimation.    It's a very egotistical and toxic thing to do.", "NTA\n\nThat girl isn't your friend because if she was YOUR friend, she would have called you first to ask if you think Henry would be okay with it. But she asked him first and Henry probably didn't care either way but deferred to you when he should have said \"I haven't even moved in yet, I don't have anything set up so I can't say yes. Plus our boundary is that we don't' have opposite sex people stay the night.\" He knew the boundary but put it on you. Either way, she only called you to get a free place to stay for a job she hasn't started yet that most likely would have paid her way for this expo. Cut your losses. Also- it's not a test if you don't know you're taking one.", "NTA- what an odd request from her. I would never ask to stay at the house of someone who I just met a few months ago. What an inconvenience. Also, if it\u2019s something you and your partner have both agreed on, then don\u2019t even worry about it.", "NTA\n\nShe asked, he isn't comfortable with it for a lot of reasons, so you said no. \n\nAnd you're right - if it's a company sponsored event, they would pay for travel and lodging. Her requesting a place to stay was premature and likely unnecessary.\n\nShe may feel that you're going the way of yalls other friends, but if people agree She should be kept at a distance then I could see why you are even less comfortable with aquiescing to her request. \n\nFor her to go no contact is quite bizarre, but indicates that yall aren't that good of friends. No sweat - just move on.", "NTA, given all the context of the situation, her asking was a far reach and it\u2019s not your or your boyfriends responsibility to host her.

Your boyfriend has no obligation to house your friend that he doesn\u2019t seem to know all that well. You were both unsure, and after some discussion you both agreed that it may have been a bad idea. To top it off, she said she would accept a no and that you didn\u2019t need to worry about it, then proceeded to give you the cold shoulder. You are willing to talk to her, she is not. If your friendship with her ends, then it is on her for refusing to communicate.", "NTA.\n\nShe has no reason to be upset, and she has no excuse for it either, so she is doing what most people do when they are upset but wrong, which is to avoid contact.   I'm sure she doesn't consider herself to be a \"homewrecker\" but there's enough there to be a concern.\n\nIn retrospect, both you and Henry were caught off-guard by the request, and you both answered \"politely\" but wrong.  \n\nHenry should have said \"no\" or \"I don't even know what sort of place I'm getting yet, so check back later\" or \"I'll think about it.\"  Instead he dumped the decision on you and then (apparently) failed to give you a heads up before Sarah called you.\n\nThen you were under pressure and said \"Uh, yeah, sure\" instead of any other deflection such as \"let me talk to Henry and I'll get back to you.\"   But for sure getting back to her within 24 hours is an acceptable time considering her odd request.", "NTA. You weren't comfortable with the situation, talked to your BF, and he agreed. In hindsight, it would have been better to tell her you had to talk  about this with your BF, instead of saying it was OK first.", "NTA- people have boundaries, relationships have boundaries... If they can't accept that they are being inconsiderate and kinda hypocritical, as again *everyone has boundaries*", "NTA, but your boyfriend is (a little bit).

Usually at the hotel where the conference takes place. There should be absolutely zero reason for her to need to spend the night at your BF\u2019s.", "NTA. Everyone has different boundaries in a relationship. Doesn\u2019t mean other peoples boundaries are wrong it\u2019s just what works for them. If your friend can\u2019t respect that, or at least have a mature conversation about it, then I personally think that\u2019s her problem not yours. \n\nYour friend probably is taking it personally and thinks you don\u2019t trust her.", ">I totally understand if not\n\nso that turned out to be a damn lie.

Then he should have told you he declined her and if that was really OK with you. \u201cHey, I told her I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with her staying, but if it\u2019s something you\u2019d like me to do, I can try to work it out.

So why would she ask your bf first instead of asking you first? If your other friends think she's a homewrecker, then she probably is.

Your boyfriend handled it well.", "NTA.\n\nI completely understand that point of view and even trusting my partner, would not feel comfortable at all if a member of their preferred gender stayed at their house.\n\nIt's down to everyone's own personal choices, of course, but it doesn't make you an AH at all, but both you and your BF both agreed on the same decision anyway.\n\nAnd no it's not because I'd be worried of anything like cheating, though you should probably do your best to limit that possibility as much as possible within reason. There could be an opportunity that someone attempts to take and could mess up the entire friendship.\n\nYou never truly know people and it's better to just not allow that situation to happen in the first place, plus that homewrecker title is a huge red flag.", "Ehhh, I dunno about being an asshole, but the message you are sending her is that you don't trust her to be alone with your boyfriend.", "NTA - He is clearly still in a state of moving out there. I just moved into my new home back in Nov and I am still not settled enough yet to have guests over let alone, let someone stay for a short period. I feel your reasoning is very justified.

Not only did your friend verbally agree to the terms of \u201cI totally understand if [it\u2019s not ok]\u201d, but you gave the answer after having spoken to your boyfriend about it and coming to a mutual agreement. In the end it\u2019s his say on who stays in his domicile, and your say after he defaulted to your approval. Both sources answered a resounding \u201cno\u201d. \n\nThe only possible in for your friend having a right to be upset from what I can see is that you changed your answer. This could have been an issue for her if she went so far as to make additional commitments elsewhere that hinged on being able to stay with your boyfriend, but it sounds like you only took a day to change your answer which is a rather reasonable time.", "ESH and I don't think you and your bf trust each other very much, I don't think you trust your friend either tbh", "Definitely NTA\n\nYou all aren\u2019t in your 40s with kids, you aren\u2019t even engaged. It doesn\u2019t even sound like your friend and BF have been great long term friends. I know would not have been psyched if my now wife but then girlfriend lived apart from me and had an attractive single male friend stay with her. I get going to dinner and what not but literally staying in the same apartment. Seems like a recipe for an \u201caccidental\u201d disaster. Lot easier for an oops to happen if she is sleeping there and drinking with your long distance boyfriend.

Or is it both?", "NTA it doesn't sound like she's a great friend, if she called you to \"catch up\" and then asked for a favor, and is now not speaking to you once you declined the favor.  \n\nIf she's traveling for work, wouldn't they provide accommodations?  If not, that's what a hotel is for, and if she can't afford that, then she shouldn't go.  Your bf is not a close friend of hers, it's a lot to ask of an acquaintance.  \n\nIf she's repeatedly being cut out of relationships and being treated like a homewrecker, perhaps she's exhibiting some behavior to cause this?  I think you made the right call.", "ESH.  You should figure out why you don't trust your boyfriend or this friend and do something about it.", "YTA - it sounds to me like you don't trust your friend, or your boyfriend for that matter. Your reaction to her request belied your own insecurities. If I was your friend, I would be angry with you too: she likely feels that you don't trust her and is deeply hurt.

She was also way too forward in asking that favor to begin with from a friend she hasn't spoken to lately and it's also weird that she'd contact OP's bf directly first, a guy she's only met a few times.. She wouldn't have even asked OP if the bf didn't tell her to- I'm seeing a connection to the fact her male friends have to cut her off when they're in relationships. Sarah sounds like maybe she doesn't understand or really respect relationship boundaries.", "*tiny three note bugle call*", "I guess that's technically true, but if that's the case it means the friend fully understands why OP's uncomfortable but is still so mad she emotionally withdraws for over a week. People are pretty dumb when it comes to expressing emotion so maybe, but I still think it's much more likely the friend just said it without meaning it and never expected to get a no in the first place.", "She's her friend? And she called her fellow friend to ask if it was cool to crash at his pad? Is it automatically a suspicious thing just because she has a vagina?", "Weird that she asked the person she would be staying with first?", "Weird that she asked _the person she would be staying with_ *first*?", "Weird that she asked _the person she would be staying with_ *first*?", "We don\u2019t know any specific information that anyone else gave to call this girl a homewrecker. That is literally just hearsay and gossip that hasn\u2019t been substantiated by OP.", "Honestly people don\u2019t normally accuse people of being homewreckers without a reason, or a big enough reason that leads to being cut off. Truthfully I think your better off without her, she sounds like she\u2019s full of drama and tantrums when she doesn\u2019t get her own way. If you\u2019ve heard all of this through her then all of it is probably BS to get sympathy points from you. The only reason she asked you was because your bf told her to, her first thing to do was to ask you if it was okay with you that she asked him, a simple no from you is more than enough and she took a tantrum over it, trust me, she\u2019s not worth it", "Slut shaming.", "Only a small pink nail-sized flag rises on a toothpick, which slowly grows as more pop up.", "Yes, this should be done. My cousin sister who is very close to me told me her boyfriend was living and working in US while she was working in our home country. Their relationship was from elementary school and she was so confident about it because she is a beauty with brain. Then her best friend (f) got a job in US too and asked if she could get her boyfriend\u2018s contact so that she gets help from him when she is in US. My sister gave his contact to her best friend because it\u2019s her best friend and she was too sure that her boyfriend would never ditch her for any girl in this world. And then in few months the boyfriend ghosted her and started sleeping with her best friend. Then her best friend started ghosting her too! And within a year she saw their wedding invite from other friends. \nSo OP just saved herself from s breakup!", "I think what that line actually was she wanted to stay in/during a month that the boyfriend would still be setting up, not actually asking to stay that long. \n\nThe friend is still pushing some boundaries though (multiple friends have distanced themselves and she stopped answering after getting a no for free accommodation).", "Did she go behind OP's back, or did she just directly ask the the person who she would be staying with? Why would she go to OP first when the boyfriend is the one who would be doing her the favor?\n\nLike, it's shitty that she ghosted OP, but before that point all she did was ask for a favor, comply with a follow-up request, and then respect their decision.", "Fully understands understands that OP thinks Sarah is a homewrecker or at least treating like she might be? Why would I continue to be friends with someone who suddenly treats me like I\u2019m trying to break up or get in the way of a their relationship?\n\nIf you implied I\u2019m a cheater\u2026I would be offended and at that point, I\u2019m not really interested in salvaging our relationship. I don\u2019t necessarily have to be _mad_ at you to ignore you. Actually, it means I\u2019m indifferent. Likely, it means I\u2019ve written you off because you don\u2019t seem to have any trust for me as a friend, so what is the point in maintaining this friendship?\n\nIt\u2019s not like Sarah pushed back on the answer she got. So, even if she wasn\u2019t expecting to hear a no, she didn\u2019t try to disrespect anyone here. She let it go. \n\nOP should have come up with an innocuous reason: \u201cMy bf just moved in and nothing is set up yet\u201d \u201cHis family/friends/movers are helping him move in that weekend so it won\u2019t be a good time\u201d \u201cSomeone else is staying that weekend, we got our dates mixed up!\u201d And yet she chose the reason that makes it sound like her friend is the problem, like anyone would, the subtext is loud.", "I think given she's only met him once, it is really only her friendship with OP that ties her enough to the BF to warrant asking to stay with him. Therefore, I believe the etiquette would normally be to ask her first. I also believe, that for most people, they would not expect their friend to ask to stay with their boyfriend by themselves without running it past them first. It seems sneaky and the motivation can be called into question.", "It's a respect thing, especially in this case where it sounds like she only met OP's bf a few times but has an established friendship with OP. The appropriate thing would have been to contact OP, explain the situation, and ask \"hey would it be cool if I asked bf if I can stay while I'm there?\" \n\nThis would have been more upfront to OP, and it would have allowed all parties to save face in the long run. OP could have offered to ask bf on her behalf, they could have discussed it privately, no one would have been put on the spot, no one's hopes would have gotten up, and again, it would have shown respect to OP and OP's relationship.", "And she might have *a chance* to go to the expo.\n\nThis sounds very much like she\u2019s trying to push her way into the group going to the expo, even though it was set up before she starts work and she might not qualify for going so soon (too new and unknown to be a company representative). There\u2019s an \u201coh but I would just go along, I can stay with a friend and join you at the expo\u201d in her gumption-y plans.", "I'm reading \"they only met a few months ago\" as \"they met relatively recently,\" not \"they've literally only met that one time.\" We don't actually know how much they've talked. \n\nThis person could just think there's a level of familiarity with BF that isn't actually reciprocated. That isn't necessarily sinister asshole behavior, that really could just be misreading a room. \n\nOP didn't mention anything about the friend trying to weasel out of talking to her, or trying to keep it secret from her.

Why in the world would you think she would continue to be friends with someone who thinks so little of her and doesn't trust her?
