I was extremely busy with work and some financial issues so altho it was weird, I didn\u2019t think much of it. But after 2 weeks passed I reached out to her to bring up a TV show she wanted me to watch and how much I was liking it so far, and ask how she was doing. \n\nShe didn\u2019t answer again for several days and at this point I get that she is definitely angry at and ignoring me, so I\u2019m giving her some space.

Most companies i\u2019ve been with fund travel and lodging for company-related activities if far away. \n\n2, he hadn\u2019t moved to that city yet (had no furniture, didn\u2019t know his work hours) and she was making plans to stay in a month while he\u2018d still be getting settled which would\u2019ve made me not ask. \n\n3, they only met a few months ago.

Probably the best for all involved.", "So many reasons why this wasn't a good idea. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe asked, you and your BF both came to the same answer (no) and now she needs to come up with other plans.\n\nI'm all for being platonic friends with opp genders  but if multiple couples have raised issues with her being a 'home wrecker' I would probably take it as a little red flag. \n\nHas she made a move on anyone taken before? What made the other couples cut her out...", "NTA \n\nHe hasn't even moved there yet and she's asking to crash for a few days?  \n\nYou, as a couple, have made relationship boundaries.   Don't break those boundaries, especially in your new long distance phase.  \n\nShe barely knows him.  \n\nShe has a history of nosing in on other people's relationships and have been shunned for it.    \n\nFor all of the reasons you state, it's inappropriate for her to even ask, much less get bent about a \"no\" answer.  \n\nETA:  \n> It almost feels like a friendship test that Henry and I both failed   \n\nNo, she failed her own \"friendship test\".   Anyone who does a \"friendship test\" immediately fails in my estimation.    It's a very egotistical and toxic thing to do.", "NTA\n\nThat girl isn't your friend because if she was YOUR friend, she would have called you first to ask if you think Henry would be okay with it. But she asked him first and Henry probably didn't care either way but deferred to you when he should have said \"I haven't even moved in yet, I don't have anything set up so I can't say yes. Plus our boundary is that we don't' have opposite sex people stay the night.\" He knew the boundary but put it on you. Either way, she only called you to get a free place to stay for a job she hasn't started yet that most likely would have paid her way for this expo. Cut your losses. Also- it's not a test if you don't know you're taking one.", "NTA- what an odd request from her. I would never ask to stay at the house of someone who I just met a few months ago. What an inconvenience. Also, if it\u2019s something you and your partner have both agreed on, then don\u2019t even worry about it.", "NTA\n\nShe asked, he isn't comfortable with it for a lot of reasons, so you said no. \n\nAnd you're right - if it's a company sponsored event, they would pay for travel and lodging. Her requesting a place to stay was premature and likely unnecessary.\n\nShe may feel that you're going the way of yalls other friends, but if people agree She should be kept at a distance then I could see why you are even less comfortable with aquiescing to her request. \n\nFor her to go no contact is quite bizarre, but indicates that yall aren't that good of friends. No sweat - just move on.", "NTA, given all the context of the situation, her asking was a far reach and it\u2019s not your or your boyfriends responsibility to host her.

Your boyfriend has no obligation to house your friend that he doesn\u2019t seem to know all that well. You were both unsure, and after some discussion you both agreed that it may have been a bad idea. To top it off, she said she would accept a no and that you didn\u2019t need to worry about it, then proceeded to give you the cold shoulder. You are willing to talk to her, she is not. If your friendship with her ends, then it is on her for refusing to communicate.", "NTA.\n\nShe has no reason to be upset, and she has no excuse for it either, so she is doing what most people do when they are upset but wrong, which is to avoid contact.   I'm sure she doesn't consider herself to be a \"homewrecker\" but there's enough there to be a concern.\n\nIn retrospect, both you and Henry were caught off-guard by the request, and you both answered \"politely\" but wrong.  \n\nHenry should have said \"no\" or \"I don't even know what sort of place I'm getting yet, so check back later\" or \"I'll think about it.\"  Instead he dumped the decision on you and then (apparently) failed to give you a heads up before Sarah called you.\n\nThen you were under pressure and said \"Uh, yeah, sure\" instead of any other deflection such as \"let me talk to Henry and I'll get back to you.\"   But for sure getting back to her within 24 hours is an acceptable time considering her odd request.", "NTA. You weren't comfortable with the situation, talked to your BF, and he agreed. In hindsight, it would have been better to tell her you had to talk  about this with your BF, instead of saying it was OK first.", "NTA- people have boundaries, relationships have boundaries... If they can't accept that they are being inconsiderate and kinda hypocritical, as again *everyone has boundaries*", "NTA, but your boyfriend is (a little bit). It clearly isn't convenient for him to have her stay and he should have told her so right away instead of putting you in an awkward position.", "NTA.\n\nIt would have been fine if you were both good with it, and it\u2019s fine that it\u2019s a boundary you both agree is not okay. \n\nAlso, I literally have never, EVER heard of a company-sponsored event, like sending people to expos or conferences, where the company didn\u2019t pay for lodging. Usually at the hotel where the conference takes place. There should be absolutely zero reason for her to need to spend the night at your BF\u2019s.", "NTA. Everyone has different boundaries in a relationship. Doesn\u2019t mean other peoples boundaries are wrong it\u2019s just what works for them. If your friend can\u2019t respect that, or at least have a mature conversation about it, then I personally think that\u2019s her problem not yours. \n\nYour friend probably is taking it personally and thinks you don\u2019t trust her.", ">I totally understand if not\n\nso that turned out to be a damn lie.

Then he should have told you he declined her and if that was really OK with you. \u201cHey, I told her I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with her staying, but if it\u2019s something you\u2019d like me to do, I can try to work it out.

So why would she ask your bf first instead of asking you first? If your other friends think she's a homewrecker, then she probably is.

There could be an opportunity that someone attempts to take and could mess up the entire friendship.\n\nYou never truly know people and it's better to just not allow that situation to happen in the first place, plus that homewrecker title is a huge red flag.", "Ehhh, I dunno about being an asshole, but the message you are sending her is that you don't trust her to be alone with your boyfriend.", "NTA - He is clearly still in a state of moving out there. I just moved into my new home back in Nov and I am still not settled enough yet to have guests over let alone, let someone stay for a short period. I feel your reasoning is very justified.

Not only did your friend verbally agree to the terms of \u201cI totally understand if [it\u2019s not ok]\u201d, but you gave the answer after having spoken to your boyfriend about it and coming to a mutual agreement. In the end it\u2019s his say on who stays in his domicile, and your say after he defaulted to your approval. Both sources answered a resounding \u201cno\u201d. \n\nThe only possible in for your friend having a right to be upset from what I can see is that you changed your answer. This could have been an issue for her if she went so far as to make additional commitments elsewhere that hinged on being able to stay with your boyfriend, but it sounds like you only took a day to change your answer which is a rather reasonable time.", "ESH and I don't think you and your bf trust each other very much, I don't think you trust your friend either tbh", "Definitely NTA\n\nYou all aren\u2019t in your 40s with kids, you aren\u2019t even engaged. It doesn\u2019t even sound like your friend and BF have been great long term friends. I know would not have been psyched if my now wife but then girlfriend lived apart from me and had an attractive single male friend stay with her. I get going to dinner and what not but literally staying in the same apartment. Seems like a recipe for an \u201caccidental\u201d disaster. Lot easier for an oops to happen if she is sleeping there and drinking with your long distance boyfriend.

Or is it both?", "NTA it doesn't sound like she's a great friend, if she called you to \"catch up\" and then asked for a favor, and is now not speaking to you once you declined the favor.  \n\nIf she's traveling for work, wouldn't they provide accommodations?  If not, that's what a hotel is for, and if she can't afford that, then she shouldn't go.  Your bf is not a close friend of hers, it's a lot to ask of an acquaintance.  \n\nIf she's repeatedly being cut out of relationships and being treated like a homewrecker, perhaps she's exhibiting some behavior to cause this?  I think you made the right call.", "ESH.  You should figure out why you don't trust your boyfriend or this friend and do something about it.", "YTA - it sounds to me like you don't trust your friend, or your boyfriend for that matter. Your reaction to her request belied your own insecurities. If I was your friend, I would be angry with you too: she likely feels that you don't trust her and is deeply hurt. This is just not the way you behave in a trusting relationship, with your boyfriend *and* with your friend.\n\nTo your point #4 that she has reportedly caused drama with other friends: if you trust your boyfriend, this is not something you need to worry about.", "YTA - with major trust issues.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like OP has reasons to not fully trust this person, it's not just insecurities.", "How? OP points out in her post that her AND BF agree that they don\u2019t want her staying over. \n\nIf anything, BF should not have put her in that position to begin with\u2014they\u2019re newly LD, he\u2019s busy moving in & doesn\u2019t have furniture, and he didn\u2019t know her all that well. If he had those concerns in the first place, he should have told the girl that he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with it rather than dragging his GF in to be the bad guy. \u201cSo and so asked to stay at my apartment for a work trip, but honestly I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and I\u2019m still not fully moved in.\u201d Like that should have been the normal conversation the next time BF and her spoke on the phone.", "I suspect she knew that she shouldn't be asking to stay at a relative strangers' house, but people often love to impose when they have something to do in another city.  She wasn't about to start by asking his long distance girlfriend if she could stay with him. She knew better. Lol.", "That is pretty strange", "Okay so removing that boundary as it was never an issue before, then I think he did the right thing deferring to you. You both spoke over it and decided against it. I think the situation both took you off guard so you saying yes then changing your mind shouldn't be held against you. But again, I don't think she is really your friend and I'd let her go", "I get it, and I'm not blaming you at all--just making suggestions for next time, or for others who find themselves in this sort of situation.\n\nI'd be curious if she called you literally minutes after talking to him, or if it was a day or two.  If Henry had time to discuss it with you and didn't, then that's on him--since he directed her to you. \n\nBut if she called within minutes, regarding a trip she didn't know if she was taking, about staying in Henry's apartment he doesn't even have yet, then I suspect she DID have ulterior motives.", "Okay, that makes sense.\n\nI don\u2019t think YTA at all, but I do think your boyfriend should have handled it without needing your help (he should have declined himself at the beginning since he said he didn\u2019t want her to stay). \n\nFrom her perspective, it probably looks like your BF was cool with it but then you didn\u2019t want it and you didn\u2019t trust her with your BF. It\u2019s silly and kinda weird that she would want to stay with him at all\u2014but it definitely makes you LOOK like the bad guy. He should have handled it from the beginning.", "I added to my comment to respond to that. Her concern with that tells me more about how much she trusts her boyfriend.", "Also, if you had JUST started the idea of an LTR, then she may have wanted to know if Henry was \"available\", whether you were breaking up, staying exclusive, or \"allowed to see other people.\""]}
