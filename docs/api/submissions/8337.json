Don't break those boundaries, especially in your new long distance phase.  \n\nShe barely knows him.  \n\nShe has a history of nosing in on other people's relationships and have been shunned for it.    \n\nFor all of the reasons you state, it's inappropriate for her to even ask, much less get bent about a \"no\" answer.  \n\nETA:  \n> It almost feels like a friendship test that Henry and I both failed   \n\nNo, she failed her own \"friendship test\".   Anyone who does a \"friendship test\" immediately fails in my estimation.    It's a very egotistical and toxic thing to do.", "NTA\n\nThat girl isn't your friend because if she was YOUR friend, she would have called you first to ask if you think Henry would be okay with it. But she asked him first and Henry probably didn't care either way but deferred to you when he should have said \"I haven't even moved in yet, I don't have anything set up so I can't say yes. Plus our boundary is that we don't' have opposite sex people stay the night.\" He knew the boundary but put it on you. Either way, she only called you to get a free place to stay for a job she hasn't started yet that most likely would have paid her way for this expo. Cut your losses. Also- it's not a test if you don't know you're taking one.", "NTA- what an odd request from her. I would never ask to stay at the house of someone who I just met a few months ago. What an inconvenience. Also, if it\u2019s something you and your partner have both agreed on, then don\u2019t even worry about it.", "NTA\n\nShe asked, he isn't comfortable with it for a lot of reasons, so you said no. \n\nAnd you're right - if it's a company sponsored event, they would pay for travel and lodging. Her requesting a place to stay was premature and likely unnecessary.\n\nShe may feel that you're going the way of yalls other friends, but if people agree She should be kept at a distance then I could see why you are even less comfortable with aquiescing to her request. \n\nFor her to go no contact is quite bizarre, but indicates that yall aren't that good of friends. No sweat - just move on.", "NTA, given all the context of the situation, her asking was a far reach and it\u2019s not your or your boyfriends responsibility to host her.

Your boyfriend has no obligation to house your friend that he doesn\u2019t seem to know all that well. You were both unsure, and after some discussion you both agreed that it may have been a bad idea. To top it off, she said she would accept a no and that you didn\u2019t need to worry about it, then proceeded to give you the cold shoulder. You are willing to talk to her, she is not. If your friendship with her ends, then it is on her for refusing to communicate.", "NTA.\n\nShe has no reason to be upset, and she has no excuse for it either, so she is doing what most people do when they are upset but wrong, which is to avoid contact.   I'm sure she doesn't consider herself to be a \"homewrecker\" but there's enough there to be a concern.\n\nIn retrospect, both you and Henry were caught off-guard by the request, and you both answered \"politely\" but wrong.  \n\nHenry should have said \"no\" or \"I don't even know what sort of place I'm getting yet, so check back later\" or \"I'll think about it.\"  Instead he dumped the decision on you and then (apparently) failed to give you a heads up before Sarah called you.\n\nThen you were under pressure and said \"Uh, yeah, sure\" instead of any other deflection such as \"let me talk to Henry and I'll get back to you.\"   But for sure getting back to her within 24 hours is an acceptable time considering her odd request.", "NTA. You weren't comfortable with the situation, talked to your BF, and he agreed. In hindsight, it would have been better to tell her you had to talk  about this with your BF, instead of saying it was OK first.", "NTA- people have boundaries, relationships have boundaries... If they can't accept that they are being inconsiderate and kinda hypocritical, as again *everyone has boundaries*", "NTA, but your boyfriend is (a little bit).

Usually at the hotel where the conference takes place. There should be absolutely zero reason for her to need to spend the night at your BF\u2019s.", "NTA. Everyone has different boundaries in a relationship. Doesn\u2019t mean other peoples boundaries are wrong it\u2019s just what works for them. If your friend can\u2019t respect that, or at least have a mature conversation about it, then I personally think that\u2019s her problem not yours. \n\nYour friend probably is taking it personally and thinks you don\u2019t trust her.", ">I totally understand if not\n\nso that turned out to be a damn lie.

Then he should have told you he declined her and if that was really OK with you. \u201cHey, I told her I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with her staying, but if it\u2019s something you\u2019d like me to do, I can try to work it out.

So why would she ask your bf first instead of asking you first? If your other friends think she's a homewrecker, then she probably is.

Your boyfriend handled it well.", "NTA.\n\nI completely understand that point of view and even trusting my partner, would not feel comfortable at all if a member of their preferred gender stayed at their house.\n\nIt's down to everyone's own personal choices, of course, but it doesn't make you an AH at all, but both you and your BF both agreed on the same decision anyway.\n\nAnd no it's not because I'd be worried of anything like cheating, though you should probably do your best to limit that possibility as much as possible within reason. There could be an opportunity that someone attempts to take and could mess up the entire friendship.\n\nYou never truly know people and it's better to just not allow that situation to happen in the first place, plus that homewrecker title is a huge red flag.", "Ehhh, I dunno about being an asshole, but the message you are sending her is that you don't trust her to be alone with your boyfriend.", "NTA - He is clearly still in a state of moving out there. I just moved into my new home back in Nov and I am still not settled enough yet to have guests over let alone, let someone stay for a short period. I feel your reasoning is very justified.

Not only did your friend verbally agree to the terms of \u201cI totally understand if [it\u2019s not ok]\u201d, but you gave the answer after having spoken to your boyfriend about it and coming to a mutual agreement. In the end it\u2019s his say on who stays in his domicile, and your say after he defaulted to your approval. Both sources answered a resounding \u201cno\u201d. \n\nThe only possible in for your friend having a right to be upset from what I can see is that you changed your answer. This could have been an issue for her if she went so far as to make additional commitments elsewhere that hinged on being able to stay with your boyfriend, but it sounds like you only took a day to change your answer which is a rather reasonable time.", "ESH and I don't think you and your bf trust each other very much, I don't think you trust your friend either tbh", "Definitely NTA\n\nYou all aren\u2019t in your 40s with kids, you aren\u2019t even engaged. It doesn\u2019t even sound like your friend and BF have been great long term friends. I know would not have been psyched if my now wife but then girlfriend lived apart from me and had an attractive single male friend stay with her. I get going to dinner and what not but literally staying in the same apartment. Seems like a recipe for an \u201caccidental\u201d disaster. Lot easier for an oops to happen if she is sleeping there and drinking with your long distance boyfriend.

Or is it both?", "NTA it doesn't sound like she's a great friend, if she called you to \"catch up\" and then asked for a favor, and is now not speaking to you once you declined the favor.  \n\nIf she's traveling for work, wouldn't they provide accommodations?  If not, that's what a hotel is for, and if she can't afford that, then she shouldn't go.  Your bf is not a close friend of hers, it's a lot to ask of an acquaintance.  \n\nIf she's repeatedly being cut out of relationships and being treated like a homewrecker, perhaps she's exhibiting some behavior to cause this?  I think you made the right call.", "ESH.  You should figure out why you don't trust your boyfriend or this friend and do something about it.", "YTA - it sounds to me like you don't trust your friend, or your boyfriend for that matter. Your reaction to her request belied your own insecurities. If I was your friend, I would be angry with you too: she likely feels that you don't trust her and is deeply hurt.

It sounds like OP has reasons to not fully trust this person, it's not just insecurities.", "How? OP points out in her post that her AND BF agree that they don\u2019t want her staying over. \n\nIf anything, BF should not have put her in that position to begin with\u2014they\u2019re newly LD, he\u2019s busy moving in & doesn\u2019t have furniture, and he didn\u2019t know her all that well. If he had those concerns in the first place, he should have told the girl that he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with it rather than dragging his GF in to be the bad guy. \u201cSo and so asked to stay at my apartment for a work trip, but honestly I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and I\u2019m still not fully moved in.\u201d Like that should have been the normal conversation the next time BF and her spoke on the phone.", "I suspect she knew that she shouldn't be asking to stay at a relative strangers' house, but people often love to impose when they have something to do in another city.  She wasn't about to start by asking his long distance girlfriend if she could stay with him. She knew better. Lol.", "That is pretty strange", "Okay so removing that boundary as it was never an issue before, then I think he did the right thing deferring to you. You both spoke over it and decided against it. I think the situation both took you off guard so you saying yes then changing your mind shouldn't be held against you. But again, I don't think she is really your friend and I'd let her go", "I get it, and I'm not blaming you at all--just making suggestions for next time, or for others who find themselves in this sort of situation.\n\nI'd be curious if she called you literally minutes after talking to him, or if it was a day or two.  If Henry had time to discuss it with you and didn't, then that's on him--since he directed her to you. \n\nBut if she called within minutes, regarding a trip she didn't know if she was taking, about staying in Henry's apartment he doesn't even have yet, then I suspect she DID have ulterior motives.", "Okay, that makes sense.\n\nI don\u2019t think YTA at all, but I do think your boyfriend should have handled it without needing your help (he should have declined himself at the beginning since he said he didn\u2019t want her to stay). \n\nFrom her perspective, it probably looks like your BF was cool with it but then you didn\u2019t want it and you didn\u2019t trust her with your BF. It\u2019s silly and kinda weird that she would want to stay with him at all\u2014but it definitely makes you LOOK like the bad guy. He should have handled it from the beginning.", "I added to my comment to respond to that. Her concern with that tells me more about how much she trusts her boyfriend.", "Also, if you had JUST started the idea of an LTR, then she may have wanted to know if Henry was \"available\", whether you were breaking up, staying exclusive, or \"allowed to see other people.\"", "NTA\nShe asked your bf, who she barely knows, then called you \"to catch up,\" expecting the response she initially got, an unprepared \"yeah, I guess so.\"\n\nOnce you had time to discuss it with your bf, you both decided a boundary was appropriate. She is only interested in what she can use, for free, from you. \n\nIn future, try to resist automatic \"yes.\" Take time to think about others' demands on your time, attention and resources. Practice replacing your default \"yes\" with \"I'll need to think about that.\" And DO take time to think. Not during the convo, after it has ended. Talk to others who might be affected. Carefully consider and value your needs and priorities. \nOnly give a \"yes\" rather than a neutral or negative (That won't work for me. No. Thanks for thinking of me, but that doesn't work for me.) AFTER you have taken the time, thoughtfully and calmly, to decide agreeing is within your comfort zone and resources.", "NTA\n\nIt's very weird that she'd go direct to him when they'd only recently met & not say anything to you until he said to check with you.\n\nAnd, I don't agree with some that deferring to you automatically means he didn't want to be bad cop by saying no.  I could easily see my husband saying he wasn't sure and to check with me because he was torn between wanting to help a friend of mine and not wanting to do something I wouldn't approve of.  I see checking with your partner before an important decision as a good thing.\n\nI also wouldn't trust this particular 'friend' to correctly recount the exact wording used.\n\nIf she were worried that you see her as a potential homewrecker then she wouldn't vanish, she'd be happy about contact with you and would be keen to respond.\n\nGiven that her company should have been paying for travel & accommodation, and very few companies will just give employees a blank cheque and not ask for receipts, I can't see why she'd choose to stay in a not-yet fully furnished place unless she was doing it to get closer to your BF.  *Maybe* she's just looking to replace some male friends and trying to strike up a friendship with your BF, maybe there's fire to go with that smoke.\n\nRegardless, I agree with those saying that she's not a friend, as she seemed to only call because she wanted something, and the evidence points towards that something potentially being your BF.", "NTA. This is a totally normal boundary to have in a relationship.\n\nWeird that she doesn\u2019t really know your boyfriend and asked this. Also\u2026why isn\u2019t her work paying for her accommodations if this is for her job? Seems sus to me.", "NTA, other than you didn't say no at the beginning. \n\nYour friend is out of line making that request, and she should know it if there is history like this. It sounds like a friend that you no longer need, which may be sad, but it may be for the best. \n\nLastly, it sounds like your bf is a good guy by making sure that you are both in agreement in keeping things trusted. Keep up that communication with him OP. IT can only get better from there", "NAH - Just give her time. If she\u2019s really your friend, she\u2019ll be okay. I say this because I\u2019ve been in her position before with my married friends. You do get a little sensitive when friends (who are supposed to trust you) don\u2019t want you to sit on the same couch (for example) as their SOs. But, eventually you realize that it\u2019s not personal\u2026it\u2019s just a boundary that your friend needs to have to feel comfortable. I will say that I\u2019ve never asked to stay at a friend\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s house\u2026so that is new.

It\u2019s pretty suspicious that she\u2019d call to ask him, who she doesn\u2019t know well, to crash for a few nights, immediately after he\u2019s moved to a new city and your relationship turns long distance. Never mind that if it\u2019s a work trip, they generally pay for hotel rooms.

It's weird she would ask him without asking you, her friend, first. And then she seems off because you said no. That's a red flag.", "NTA. There's a reason why that couple cut her off and those guys agreed with it. I wouldn't want her staying alone with my boyfriend, either.", "NTA- I wouldnt be comfortable either in your shoes, especially with a group of ladies seeing her as someone who would disrupt a relationship. Not fair for every single woman to be seen a femme fatal, but your boyfriend was obviously worried about it as well if he agreed. She would get a fixed amount she could spend on lodging and although maybe it is a stipend that she could pocket, you dont have to be party to that.  I think it is weird and if she wants to bail as a friend because of this, how good of a friend was she?", "She also stated the it was as ok with her if you didn\u2019t want it to happen.", "NTA. I was so sooooooo ready to say Y T A (no friends of \"preferred gender\" can stay over?! Your fidelity depends purely on lack of proximity?! I'm bi, should I never be alone with anyone ever?!) and then all the added details were... ah, yeah,  I've met several of her clones. She's trouble and a people-user and a shit-stirrer and more than likely a negative triangulator.\n\n(I still think you're both mad as a bag of rats about the friends staying over thing, you're actual people with free will not gender magnets, but that's your call.)", "Oh storytime, a few years ago I had a close friend\u2019s girlfriend, who I had actually only met a few times but seemed to be becoming good friends with ask to stay with me and my husband while she was getting back on her feet. Basically she had moved for a job and was staying with a couple friends while she saved up for an apartment but they got into some kind of disagreement and asked her to leave. And while I totally recognized all those red flags, it was basically our couch or homelessness so I told her she had two weeks to find somewhere else to stay in the meantime. \n\nOver those two weeks it became clear she was secretly a functioning alcoholic as she quickly finished an entire handle of rum all by herself along with many many bottles of wine, she ate an entire 3lb block of cheddar cheese I had intended to use for my husband\u2019s lunches for weeks in only a few days, helped herself to my jewelry and curling iron, both of which were kept in my nightstand  drawer next to very personal items usually kept in nightstand drawers, used my iPad to take and send nudes and then did not delete the photos or conversations before returning it to me, she even attempted to demand I give her my parking space and as the two weeks were coming to a close she told my friend that she knew I had told her she only had two weeks but that I hadn\u2019t mentioned her leaving again since, so she figured she was just going to keep staying with us since we \u201cliked her so much.\u201d I made sure to casually remind her that her time was up and I even helped her move all her shit to her new destination without ever being unkind to her, which was very difficult for me because I\u2019m just not that nice of a person. \n\nTwo months later my mom had a cancer scare and when I turned to her for support she told me she was probably going to die and soon, before inviting my husband to stop by her house at 11pm that night to \u201ctalk\u201d because he and I were in a tiff. Spoiler alert, my mom did not die, and my husband did not go to her house, but I did never speak to her again, despite several of her attempts to get my attention. Um so long story long, NTA, lmao.", "NTA, especially with the added info. I totally agree that it would be a work expense and a big burden on your bf if he doesn\u2019t have furniture yet.\n\nI find it very odd that she even asked.", "Is she flirtatious? \n\nIs she just hot? Does she trigger insecurity in other women? \n\nIs her sin that she is single? \n\nThe \u201cmale friends\u201d agreeing to cut her out is indicative of absolutely nothing but cowardice.\n\nHas she done anything at all to deserve her reputation ?\n\nOr is it just boring, garden variety misogyny?\n\nI don\u2019t blame her for moving on.

She is so sketch that a few couples in the friend group have cut her off and a few single guys even agreed with the couples with it. So weird she asked the guy first. You always ask your girl friend first. Not the girlfriends boyfriend that you barely know.
