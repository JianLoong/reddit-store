I used \u201csomewhat\u201d because I didn\u2019t want the impression that I eloped, it was just a small church wedding. \nThe reason I invited some and not others was because I was close to some of the couples (like aunts, and new in laws). I also didn\u2019t want to NOT invite people just because they were dating and I stated the stipulations before this occurred, so she kind of wanted an exception. I also worried that if I let her, other friends would be upset that their plus one couldn\u2019t. Kind of like if you give one kid candy, you have to give all of them candy? Or it\u2019s not fair?", "I definitely think if I had met him, and if I\u2019d known sooner than a month or so leading up to the wedding I could\u2019ve made at least arrangements.

I also wasn't really asked just kind of informed essentially that I was going."]}
