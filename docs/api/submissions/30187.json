It's like people being boggled at a white person saying they're African. Yes, whites are born in Africa. Charlize Theron is South African. But she's not a POC and will never be. You can be Latina (born in Mexico/South America/Spain), but that doesn't mean you're ALSO POC. Hell, a lot of actors from Spain who have that thick delicious accent call themselves white.

I wish more people got wakeup calls about this. It'd be one thing for her to like it and be interested enough to learn the language/be involved in things, but to be like \"Yeah, my dad's balls were in Bolivia for enough time for him to learn to speak Spanish, so that passed onto me and now I'm Latina.\" That's not how that works.", "Im no expert but that sounds really odd.

There are ten languages (outside of Spanish) that each have millions of native speakers and there are several hundred languages spoken in the region.\n\nBolivia specifically has something like 35 or 36 official languages and approx 1/3 of the population doesn\u2019t speak Spanish at all.", "Age 15 to 32.\nBoth of their parents were born in the US, but her father moved to Bolivia.

Her dad is American, grew up in America, and moved to Bolivia for some years, and no longer lives there.

If the answer is no, then they are not Latinos.\n\nIn a previous comment, you mentioned having family in Argentina with German ancestry (something quite common in that country). I assume your relatives were born/grew up in the country or still live there, which implies they adopted its customs (language, cuisine, traditions, religion, etc.). Argentine culture is part of their life and identity, and that's what it means to be Latino. An example of this is actress Anya Taylor-Joy.", "None of what OP is talking about has anything to do with you and your situation.

She's saying her mom felt out of place when she moved back to the US, where she already speaks English natively, her parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles speak English.

Her mom went there because she was \"curious about the culture\" and she wanted to \"save the poor locals\" and do the whole white savior trope. Especially being a white Anglo person living there, she's already at the top.\n\nBeing a Chinese immigrant in the US is the opposite - we're invisible, we need to practice our culture out of sight, we often lose our language because there's just no environment to learn it (especially as it's not a Western language), people are suspicious, plus I don't need to talk about geopolitics and what not. When Chinese people immigrate to the US, they're not there to save the Americans. They go for a different kind of education, they work their butts off learning English and trying to find a decent job, they want their children to assimilate, then find jobs and build families like the average human being.\n\nHer mom never settled in South America.

This culture becomes a part of your daily life.\n\nOP's friend doesn't have any of these connections. While her father may live in Bolivia, it doesn't necessarily mean he adopted Bolivian culture (learning Spanish is not the same as adopting a culture) and then passed it on to his daughter.\n\nIn summary, it's unlikely that she has a deep connection with Latin culture and that it's a part of her life if she never lived there, and if her father, even if he lived there, didn't pass down the traditions to his family, which seems to be the case since OP's friend doesn't even speak Spanish.", "Her dad isn't from Bolivia though.

Gatekeeping will make sure only the group that is latino can share and talk about it and with that a proper discussion between us and society can flourish with both sides communicating, like how the OP shared, her dad isnt even born in Bolivia he just was raised there for sometime and speak spanish, thats all.
