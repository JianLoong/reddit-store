It's nice that they see Alice once a month for a visit, but they clearly enable your BIL and have justified his atrocious actions. How dare they expect Alice to still consider this pen pal her DAD?! What you said wasn't just true, it had surely been building up for quite some time.

My blood is boiling just thinking about it.\n\nAlso, I just want to say that you and your wife are the furthest thing away from being assholes.

My sister's passing made everything seem so empty for a while, but looking at her daughter grow up to become the amazing young woman that she is-- it doesn't make the grief go away but it makes it easier to handle.

Why spare his feelings or his false image? He didn\u2019t spare his daughter\u2019s feelings when he abandoned her and ran to find a do over family.

Daniel was wrong expecting his bio daughter to give him a hug. Nevertheless I think it would have been enough to tell him exactly this. \"The child hardly knows you, please understand she won't just hug you like this.\"  Everything else OP said may be true, but the whole thing is way too complicated to bring it up at a moment like this, in an accusing way, with Daniels wife and children as well ad  OPs adopted daughter around. To me OP seems to hold a grudge and I am not sure why this is so. Daniel did not take the role of the father in his first born daughters life. From the facts we are told it seems he was not able to take care of her. Yes, parents should be able to take care of their children under all circumstances, and if OP was not around it could have ended badly, but sometimes people just can't do what they ought to do. To have lost the love of your life is not a minor thing, and to process this along with providing for a toddler and taking care of her obviously was obviously something Daniel could not manage then. To leave the child with OP was all in all a good decision, as they are good people and were willing to do take her in. To sign over all parental rights later on was good, too, I think, as it provided stability to the girl. I guess she had accepted OP and his wife as parents by then whereas Daniels lief was unstable. Daniel pays child support, which is good. Obviously recently he tries to be in his daughters life by writing letters, which is quite a nice way to revive the relationship without interfering with OPs family life. So I wonder what caused OPs outburst. Is he angry because the child was left with them without s clear outlook of how to proceed? Did his adopted daughter express a wish to see her bio dad more often which was not granted? Was he angry because Daniel called himself her dad? Is he angry about Daniel acting as if everything was fine in front of his family while he feels Daniel found an easy way out and should not be forgiven to have failed where he was supposed to be strong? OP does not write he sees the child as his own, he writes his sons see her as a sister. Would he have liked to adopt her but it was not possible? Does he feel she is a burden to him despite the fact he loves her? Did Daniel never thank them properly for the huge, huge, huge favour they did to him? OP and his wife stepping up is the best thing that could have happened to the child for sure!!! Maybe the problem is that times are changing and the time has come  to sort some things out. There is a chance Daniel and the girl would like to interact more in the future, so it may be good if everybody who is involved, including OP and Daniel, gets the chance to talk about how they feel about everything  and how they would like to proceed.
