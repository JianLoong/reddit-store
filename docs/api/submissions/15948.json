It's nice that they see Alice once a month for a visit, but they clearly enable your BIL and have justified his atrocious actions. How dare they expect Alice to still consider this pen pal her DAD?!

My blood is boiling just thinking about it.\n\nAlso, I just want to say that you and your wife are the furthest thing away from being assholes.

Why spare his feelings or his false image? He didn\u2019t spare his daughter\u2019s feelings when he abandoned her and ran to find a do over family.

Daniel was wrong expecting his bio daughter to give him a hug. Nevertheless I think it would have been enough to tell him exactly this. \"The child hardly knows you, please understand she won't just hug you like this.\"  Everything else OP said may be true, but the whole thing is way too complicated to bring it up at a moment like this, in an accusing way, with Daniels wife and children as well ad  OPs adopted daughter around. To me OP seems to hold a grudge and I am not sure why this is so. Daniel did not take the role of the father in his first born daughters life. From the facts we are told it seems he was not able to take care of her. Yes, parents should be able to take care of their children under all circumstances, and if OP was not around it could have ended badly, but sometimes people just can't do what they ought to do. To have lost the love of your life is not a minor thing, and to process this along with providing for a toddler and taking care of her obviously was obviously something Daniel could not manage then. To leave the child with OP was all in all a good decision, as they are good people and were willing to do take her in. To sign over all parental rights later on was good, too, I think, as it provided stability to the girl. I guess she had accepted OP and his wife as parents by then whereas Daniels lief was unstable. Daniel pays child support, which is good. Obviously recently he tries to be in his daughters life by writing letters, which is quite a nice way to revive the relationship without interfering with OPs family life. So I wonder what caused OPs outburst. Is he angry because the child was left with them without s clear outlook of how to proceed? Did his adopted daughter express a wish to see her bio dad more often which was not granted? Was he angry because Daniel called himself her dad? Is he angry about Daniel acting as if everything was fine in front of his family while he feels Daniel found an easy way out and should not be forgiven to have failed where he was supposed to be strong? OP does not write he sees the child as his own, he writes his sons see her as a sister. Would he have liked to adopt her but it was not possible? Does he feel she is a burden to him despite the fact he loves her? Did Daniel never thank them properly for the huge, huge, huge favour they did to him? OP and his wife stepping up is the best thing that could have happened to the child for sure!!! Maybe the problem is that times are changing and the time has come  to sort some things out. There is a chance Daniel and the girl would like to interact more in the future, so it may be good if everybody who is involved, including OP and Daniel, gets the chance to talk about how they feel about everything  and how they would like to proceed.

If she hadn't been pregnant, she might have fought harder because her body would have been stronger. \"If\" is the worst. People play \"Woulda Coulda Shoulda\" all the time, especially after a tragedy. Poor Daniel lost the love of his life and got stuck with a reminder of why she died -- probably one who looked just like her. Of course, I'm not excusing his decision to run, but I definitely understand it. I've loved that deeply, and I've lost that much. Some people handle tragedy better than others. It is what it is.   \n\n\nAt the least, he knew his limits. He sent money and letters, which was probably the best he could do under the circumstances. Daniel isn't perfect; none of us are. He found someone he could trust to look after his child, and he kept in touch. Maybe he knew he just wasn't mentally in a place where he could care for someone else 24 hours a day. Again, not excusing his behavior, but I know what it's like to lose a spouse and be left with children who depend on you for their very existence. At least my kids were in their teens when their dad died, not that it's a picnic at any age.   \n\n\nObviously you and Alice both harbor some ill feelings toward Daniel. That's to be expected. But he struggled, too. He lost, too. He got screwed out of his \"happily ever after,\" too. Everyone seems to have moved on. Alice is with a happy family, and so is Daniel. Seems like everyone is finally in a good place. Now is the time to start healing that relationship, not picking at the scab. I know you're mad, but you don't have to say every single thing you think. But I don't think you're TA for saying it in the heat of the moment. It's been building up for a long time, and maybe Daniel needed to hear it. From this point forward, though, it's not about telling Daniel what a horrible father he was -- it's about raising Alice with a sense of compassion and the ability to forgive.", "He\u2019s a sperm donor at this point. Not a father, certainly not a Dad.\n\nWas it rude to say it in front of his other children, probably, but they aren\u2019t blind either they see how he treats her vs them.", "Nta. If he didn't want an honest reaction he shouldn't have ambushed you. Why no warning he would be there with his family?

He came to town and couldn't even give his daughter a heads up, then tried to act like dear old dad. It sucks his kids overheard but it doesn't sound like you did it on purpose.

You have the right to tell someone they are a shit parent anyway, but you have the chops to back it up.", "NTA Lol he doesn't even have the legal rights to be called her \"dad\", he signed his rights over her to you!\n\nYou know what else is needed? For alice to also release all her pent up feelings of abandonment to him, that or a direct and honest statement of her not feeling anything to him and that he's just a complete stranger to her.\n\nI bet his wife and children doesn't know anything about alice. Damn. He just completely moved on from his past life yet he has the audacity to say that to her after 14 yrs of not seeing her?", "NTA - he never intended on being a father to Alice without her mother to do the child rearing. He\u2019d be dumping his other kids, too, if their mom disappeared", "NTA, if I saw a stranger try to hug my unwilling kid I'd go off too. That's all he is, a stranger. Alice has autonomy to decide who she hugs, you defended her from emotional blackmail and physical contact with someone she's uncomfortable with. Wes needs to get his head out of his arse, him acting like a flying monkey is only going to isolate her from that side of the family.", "NTA. Also you are an icon. She\u2019s lucky to have you.", "NTA. Daniel is obviously an AH. Also the uncle. How dare they not warn you and Alice that her bio father was there and let her make the decision about whether or not to see her. And that he wanted a big hug? Gross. She doesn\u2019t even know him.", "NTA - You\u2019re my hero. When people don\u2019t have a leg to stand on, they sometimes try to deflect by accusing you of being an AH to lessen their culpability. It\u2019s classic gaslighting. Let\u2019s be honest. His wife already knows that what you said was true and his children would have eventually figured out that he was a deadbeat. If anything, you saved your niece from having to say it herself. Btw - has he even tried to reach out to his daughter after this incident? I\u2019m guessing no.", "I am just glad that Alice has you and your wife. You are her real family. You have been there for her.", " Daniel is the one who abandoned a child who had already lost her mother.  Daniel is the one who decided to ambush you and Alice by giving no warning that the whole family would be there.  The reaction of both you and Alice is understandable.\n\nOverall, the result of Daniel\u2019s behavior was that Alice had two caring parents and three little brothers.  I know the abandonment was traumatic.  However, in the long run, she is likely better off with you. Daniel sounds like a real piece of work.  Very self-centered.  He either doesn\u2019t consider or doesn\u2019t care about Alice\u2019s feelings.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the children heard the truth about their father, but I still say NTA.", "You did right by your sister and she is all what matters too your little girl(She has your blood you just did not have the fun in making her) He abandoned her if it was not for the fact that you and your sister are blood where would your daughter have been today, where would he have DUMPED her?", "Wait, Alice's father lives in another country with his new family, yet he came back for a visit and never told you or his daughter?\n\nYou just happened to see him & his new family at your other brothers house??  WTF!\n\nWhy didn't he tell you & Alice?

Also wasn\u2019t your intention but the other kids are innocent. NTA for what was said", "NTA - you were just speaking the truth. If he's upset you gave his wife and kids a true perspective of him, that's on him, not you.", "I had to think a bit of this one. NTA, in fact his wife and kids should know the truth.

He was an AH for (1) not giving her & you notice that he was there, (2) having the audacity to call himself her dad & attempting to hug a child who is virtually a stranger to him, and (3) doing those things with complete disregard for the actual father that raised her.", "Daniel did not invite his own daughter to his wedding. Daniel did not bother to tell you or Alice that he was in town.  In my book, Daniel should live with consequences of his inactions.  NTA, superdad!!!", "NTA.  he isn\u2019t her dad.  He left her! Now he comes into town, doesn\u2019t tell his daughter and she sees him for the first time in years.  He deserves much worse.  So what if his new wife and kids heard.  The truth is the truth.  This man started an entire new family and did not even tell his daughter, she had to find out from her Uncle.  He is a sorry excuse for a human.", "Well, he asked you at that time caught you off guard. It was out of emotion as you defended your daughter (yes, she's yours as you've been her father her whole life). The 2nd wife and kids didn't have to hear it but what is said has been said. Sometimes it feels better just to let it out. NTA.", "NTA.\n\n> I did apologize to Alice for disparaging her father, but she just shrugged and said it would\u2019ve only been disparaging if it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nThat there, OP. You raised a smart girl.\n\nIf he doesn't want to look bad infront of other people he should have behaved better in the past. Whatever trauma made him \"check out\", it was his responsibility to adress and work through, for the benefit of his daughter. He didn't. He got a new family instead and left her.\n\nAnd I really think his wife and other kids should know the truth. Because what I find almost as bad as a deadbeat parent is their (new) partner not being totally disgusted with them abandoning their own child... \n\nAs for his other kids... they probably will see his true nature sooner or later anyway and at least they might grow up understanding that Alice did not have the same loving father in their dad as they did (she had one in you OP, absolutely awesome how you step up for her \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb and I think Alice's feelings matter 1000% more than that of her deadbeat father).", "*He came up to Alice and tried to hug her but she stepped back from him.* \n\n**He should have left it here.**  That would have shown respect for Alice, and acceptance that he's not been close to her and accepts her decision not to hug him.\n\n*He looked hurt and when he asked why she didn\u2019t want to give her dad a hug*\n\nInstead, **he pushed.**  He was **manipulating her to feel guilt**, because HE wanted a hug from her, and HE wanted to feel like a dad.  He was basically **insisting on the rewards of being a dad, without having done any of the real work** to make this a reality.  Penpal and checks do not make him a dad. \n\nHis behavior **ignored Alice and her needs**.  He **ignored her feelings.**  He ignored that she might have a different perspective than he does. \n\nNot only that, no one warned the two of you that he was going to be there. \n\nSo, **Alice was ambushed**, not knowing he would be there.  Then she was put in the position of having to step back and not be hugged when she didn't want to be hugged.  THEN, **instead of being respected for her very reasonable feelings** about him, he **tried to humiliate her into compliance.**  He manipulated her, to soothe himself, while dismissing her very real needs and feelings when he should have been putting her needs and feelings first, not himself.   But then, that's what he's done to her for her whole life.\n\n*\u2014 I snapped.* \n\n**Of course you did.  Your daughter Alice was being mistreated** by someone who claims to care about her.  But he made it obvious that he cared more about his own wants and image than about her.\n\n**If he didn't want to be confronted in front of his wife and children, he shouldn't have ambushed Alice in front of them.**  It's not your fault that they were there.  It's not your fault that his behavior towards Alice was hurting her and she needed your protection.  It's not your fault that instead of accepting her not wanting a hug or to pretend he was a great 'dad', he pushed and manipulated her.  It wasn't your fault that he abandoned his child, and now wants to claim a relationship that never existed.  None of this is your fault.\n\nWhen we protect our kids, we don't first look around at the audience and play to them, like he was.  **You prioritized the priority:  Alice.**  \n\n**NTA.

However I think he needed to hear what you said. I honestly think this man is extremely selfish.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't mean for his family to hear it, but by some luvky chance they did.
