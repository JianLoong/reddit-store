They were highschool sweethearts and they tied the knot shortly after their graduation. They had a daughter together, Alice (16f), who was Rachel\u2019s entire world.\nRachel ended up being diagnosed with cancer when she was a few weeks away from delivery and after Alice was born, she started chemo asap. It ended up being treatment resistant and aggressive, and Rachel ended up passing by the time Alice was 2.\n\nDaniel emotionally checked out completely. He decided to take a job opportunity abroad, and he left Alice in mine and my wife\u2019s custody. At first he said it was temporary, that he just needed to get things in order before Alice came to live with him, but eventually it was obvious that it would be much longer.\nHe signed his rights over to us, and we've been raising her alongside our three sons. As far as the boys are concerned, Alice is their big sister, and as far as Alice is concerned, they\u2019re her little brothers.\n\nDaniel got remarried, and he had two daughters. Alice wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding, we only found out about it after his brother mentioned it to us.\n\nDaniel does send money for her, and they write letters back and forth like he and Rachel used to do in school. I know that there has to be some part of him that loves his daughter, but it\u2019s hard to believe it considering how he practically abandoned her after Rachel died.\n\nDaniel\u2019s brother Wes has helped out a bit with Alice too. She\u2019ll go over to his house at least once a month to see him, his wife, and their kids.\nA few days ago, I was taking Alice over, and when we got there, we saw that Daniel + his wife and kids were there.\nI was ready to get back in the car and take Alice home but Daniel saw us and came outside.\n\nHe came up to Alice and tried to hug her but she stepped back from him. He looked hurt and when he asked why she didn\u2019t want to give her dad a hug\u2014 I snapped.\nI asked how he could seriously stand there and refer to himself as her dad when all he\u2019s ever been to her is a pen pal. I called him a joke of a father and a sorry excuse for a man.\n\nHis wife and their daughters overheard what I said. When Alice and I got back home, Wes called me and left a message saying that he agrees that Daniel hasn\u2019t been the best father to Alice, but I didn\u2019t need to tell him that in front of his wife & their kids. Daniel feels the same way.\n\nI did apologize to Alice for disparaging her father, but she just shrugged and said it would\u2019ve only been disparaging if it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nMy wife said she probably would\u2019ve done worse if she\u2019d been there, but part of me does feel that I could have said it out of earshot of his children.", "created_utc": 1682736130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132h6ce/aita_for_calling_my_bil_a_joke_of_a_father_in/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "NTA\n\nHis wife knows what he is doing (being just a pen pal to his daughter). The two daughters will eventually get older and form their own opinions. Hell even his daughter Alice said it was true.", "I mean, you might be an asshole, but sometimes being an asshole is fine. I would have said the same thing in your shoes so I guess I'm one too. Please rest assured knowing that kid does in fact have a good dad.", "NTA.  The truth hurts and he had to hear it, so did he wife and kids.  Maybe his other kids will start to question him on why they don't see their sister.  Good for you.", "NTA sounds like it was something he need to hear tbh. The only way I'd have a problem with this would be if Alice was embarrassed and she wasn't.\n\nEdit: honestly he probably also needs to hear that Rachel would be absolutely devastated to see what he did to their family. But maybe that's a thought for next time.", "NTA\n\nI honestly feel it was a proper reaction. I do agree it could maybe have been away from the younger kids, but it was an immediate in-the-moment response to how he was acting towards Alice, I think the defense of Alice mitigates the slight negative.", "NTA. The truth hurts, Daniel kids were eventually going to find out that daddy didn't raised alice. He's just a sperm donor who sends money once a month. Your Alice dad/ uncle who raised her.", "NTA. From what you wrote, you weren\u2019t aware that the wife and kids were around to hear that. I feel like you said what needed to be said.", "Nta", "NTA Literally the only possible way you could have been the slightest bit of an asshole here is if Alice was upset about what you said. And even then, it would be so minor compared to what your BIL did that I'd still vote him the asshole. And her brother isn't much better. It's nice that they see Alice once a month for a visit, but they clearly enable your BIL and have justified his atrocious actions. How dare they expect Alice to still consider this pen pal her DAD?! What you said wasn't just true, it had surely been building up for quite some time. And then to have to just accidentally stumble upon them, when they clearly didn't even try to visit Alice while they were here?! My blood is boiling just thinking about it.\n\nAlso, I just want to say that you and your wife are the furthest thing away from being assholes. And I am genuinely so grateful that Alice had the two of you to step in after she lost her mother and was abandoned by her father. And the fact she took on a big sis role to your three boys is just the sweetest thing ever. I hope Alice, your boys, and the only real parents she currently has here on earth (you and your wife) all the happiness in the world.", "He isn\u2019t Alice\u2018s dad. You are. And she clearly agrees. He is some sort of distant idea who sends money. Like some distant relative. Of course losing the love of your life was tough and i could see how he might have even irrationally blamed Alice, but he doesn\u2019t take accountability. He checked out and now that he has his perfect little family thinks he deserves Alice to be his daughter. But she isn\u2019t. Not emotionally.\n\nAnd you can tell Wes that you did what any father would do. You defended and protected your child. Biology doesn\u2019t make a family (and you share blood too). If he actually cared about Alice he wouldn\u2019t be demanding or acting like this. Its all about him, and good for you for standing in her corner. \n\nNTA", "You did the right thing in a situation where you absolutely needed to be TA and rip him a new one. Of course, Daniel is one hell of an actual AH for abandoning his kid. Alice is blessed to have you as her actual dad.", "NTA! The nerve of that man to pretend like everything was ok.", "NTA. Truth hurts. Daniel is a pathetic excuse of a father", "The critical thing here is that to Alice you're not the arsehole - you're the hero.", "ESH\n\nI don't think I need to spell out why Daniel sucks. \n\nYou suck because you took him on in front of his children. Don't do that shit in front of children. **Especially** don't do it in front of Alice. It's not about her being upset with you or not, it's about the fact that you put her in a position where she had to choose. That's not ok.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's your kid, her opinion is the one that matters. Either Daniel's wife doesn't know and needs to find out what kind of person he is or she does know and she married him anyway, which means she can deal with hearing the truth", "NTA. I remember accidentally referring to my step-dad as \u201cmy dad\u201d to my biological father, who was largely a pen pal in my childhood. I\u2019d been referring to my step-dad as \u201cdad\u201d for years, but I never called him that to my bio-dad, mostly out of respect. And then one day I casually said something about \u201cmy parents,\u201d referring to my mom and step-dad. I was mortified. But he didn\u2019t call it out, because he knew he wouldn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. \n\nThe difference between my dad and your brother-in-law is that mine has openly told me he\u2019s thankful my mom was able to raise me the way she did, and that she found someone who could be there for me. He knew he wasn\u2019t a present parent\u2014so he doesn\u2019t try to take away the title from someone who was. \n\nI call both of them dad, but they both know who earned it and who got it by default.", ">part of me does feel that I could have said it out of earshot of his children.\n\nI think his kids deserve to know the person he is. I'd want to know if my dad abandoned a child. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, and you are awesome for taking Alice in and raising her like one of your own. The fact that Alice is not upset/agrees just reinforces that you were in the right and that you care about her. The fact that Wes actually reached out to you and could say what he did with sincerity while not chastising his brother for abandoning his kid is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard.", "Does she know? It\u2019s possible that he gave it a pretty spin that *of course* he wanted Alice to live with them now that things were stable, but she chose OP. Maybe his wife doesn\u2019t even want Alice and is happy to believe his lies.\n\nRegardless, NTA, and I laughed when I read the end of Daniel agreeing with Wes. Wah, wah, deadbeat.", "I recently saw someone use ABJ (asshole but justified) for an answer like this. Would that not be a great additional option on this page? I love it.", "Thank you. My sister's passing made everything seem so empty for a while, but looking at her daughter grow up to become the amazing young woman that she is-- it doesn't make the grief go away but it makes it easier to handle. Rachel always managed to fill every room with so much joy, and Alice does too. She's a light in the world, and I'm fortunate enough to witness it first hand as her uncle. My wife and I are so proud of her, and I know my sister would be too.", "Not just how could he think he could just waltz back in after all this time and call himself \"dad\" but essentially he is a stranger to Alice. \n\nAnd it also doesn't sound like Daniel's wife and kids were outside at the time; just that they overhead OP. \n\nCompletely NTA.", "And not legally, he signed his rights over to them.", "He was blindsided by the dad being at the brother's house. Let alone being in the COUNTRY. Nope. Communication works both ways and they failed. Op is NTA.", "His wife and kids should know, so if they didn't then it's a good thing they now do.\n\nBesides he literally asked.", "Daniel acted like Alice owes him affection. He completely ignored her feelings on the matter and had the gall to call her out. OP stood up for Alice, because he is her real dad. The wife should absolutely know the truth and i don\u2019t think Daniel is going to provide it. He would probably put the blame squarely on Alice", "How is it his fault if the wife & kids don\u2019t know the extent of the situation? If you\u2019re married to someone, shouldn\u2019t they know that you have a child? I can see both sides where possibly ESH, but I would definitely not go straight out with him being TA.", "Considering Daniel signed his parental rights over to OP, the sperm donor has a lot of nerve to call himself \u201cdad\u201d now"]}
