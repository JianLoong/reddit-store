And even then, it would be so minor compared to what your BIL did that I'd still vote him the asshole. And her brother isn't much better. It's nice that they see Alice once a month for a visit, but they clearly enable your BIL and have justified his atrocious actions. How dare they expect Alice to still consider this pen pal her DAD?! What you said wasn't just true, it had surely been building up for quite some time. And then to have to just accidentally stumble upon them, when they clearly didn't even try to visit Alice while they were here?! My blood is boiling just thinking about it.\n\nAlso, I just want to say that you and your wife are the furthest thing away from being assholes. And I am genuinely so grateful that Alice had the two of you to step in after she lost her mother and was abandoned by her father.

And she clearly agrees. He is some sort of distant idea who sends money. Like some distant relative. Of course losing the love of your life was tough and i could see how he might have even irrationally blamed Alice, but he doesn\u2019t take accountability. He checked out and now that he has his perfect little family thinks he deserves Alice to be his daughter. But she isn\u2019t. Not emotionally.\n\nAnd you can tell Wes that you did what any father would do. You defended and protected your child. Biology doesn\u2019t make a family (and you share blood too).

I remember accidentally referring to my step-dad as \u201cmy dad\u201d to my biological father, who was largely a pen pal in my childhood. I\u2019d been referring to my step-dad as \u201cdad\u201d for years, but I never called him that to my bio-dad, mostly out of respect.

It\u2019s possible that he gave it a pretty spin that *of course* he wanted Alice to live with them now that things were stable, but she chose OP.

My sister's passing made everything seem so empty for a while, but looking at her daughter grow up to become the amazing young woman that she is-- it doesn't make the grief go away but it makes it easier to handle.

You sir, are a legend. You and your wife stepped up and took in a girl that lost her mum and was ditched by her dad, you both deserve a medal for what you've done. Daniel is not a dad, not by a long shot. He's an AH who wants to be Disney fun dad but Alice sees through it. I hope all his socks have holes in them and are full of lego", "NTA. Why spare his feelings or his false image? He didn\u2019t spare his daughter\u2019s feelings when he abandoned her and ran to find a do over family. He should be happy it was said in private around just his immediate family, and not addressed via social media or at a large family event.", "Y T A for only one small reason.
