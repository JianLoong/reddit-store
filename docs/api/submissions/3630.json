The uncle Violated the agreement and needed to rectify the situation he had caused that violated the agreement.", "Unfortunately for the owners, without a written detailed contract with that specified, the uncle is paying for what is considered full use. The correct way to handle this is to execute a formal contract and specify this. Too many owners get in these kinds of challenges and aren\u2019t protected. Without an executed and detailed agreement, the law will apply in favor of whomever is living there.
