I would be given a loft area and a blowup bed. I was furious but played it cool because the aunt is elderly and a very nice lady. I should mention that their extended family is huge.

I could have figured out other arrangements before I even got there. \n\nMy brother and my mom are saying I\u2019m an asshole for leaving two minutes after I got there and making the Aunt and parents feel bad. I understand that it was an accident of nature and they needed a place to stay but I\u2019m pissed because they had other options. I blame my brother and SIL for (I assume) not telling her family that I was coming and not telling me that both bedrooms were taken. \n\nI know in the history of AITA this isn\u2019t a huge deal but I\u2019m all alone in a hotel fuming and my mom, who\u2019s not involved in anything, is saying I\u2019m rude to a little old lady in her time of need.

Your Mom taking up for him makes it seem he\u2019s the golden child. I\u2019m sorry this all is happening, that really stinks.", "How do you know the \u201cother options\u201d were available. If it was a bad storm then I assume a lot of people were looking for somewhere to stay also and may have stayed at the homes of those \u201cother options\u201d, or those homes were also affected. I\u2019m saying you\u2019re NTA because you had every right to go somewhere else if you weren\u2019t comfortable, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough info to have an opinion for any other reason than that.", "NTA  It's never wrong to book a room where you'll be more comfortable.  I guess they are saying that people's feelings are hurt (maybe) because you made it clear they were inconveniencing you enough that you had to leave.  Well.... if you don't want someone's actions to imply you inconvenienced them, don't inconvenience them.  Your brother is the A H here for not letting you know, not offering to get you a room or get the aunts and inlaws a room or not suggesting some other family member in town could put them up.  Why your mother is taking his side in this is a mystery.  Unless we have the all too common Golden Child syndrome.  Tell her to come out and sleep on a blow up mattress in the loft.", "NTA. \n\nBrother should have given you a heads up as soon as Aunt came to stay and took up the 2nd room. \nThere really wasn't another room for you, so you did the sensible thing and moved to a hotel. \n\nBro (and SIL) dropped the ball here and are at fault for the lack of communication about the boarding situation. Yes, freak nature event, but as you said, they could have informed Aunt and SIL's parents that another, out of town, planned guest was arriving on X date so other plans could be made.", "NTA\n\nI am a hotel person. I prefer the autonomy of having my own space and bathroom, and sometimes I just like the privacy. \n\nI always respect schedules and plans, and don\u2019t mind getting up early or staying up late to accommodate my hosts. They are still my hosts and I appreciate the hospitality but I need space.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t really even cause a scene either so good on you!", "NTA", "NTA  Aside from the sleeping arrangements what person to bathroom ratio is there going to be? Are you going to be able to have any meaningful time with your family rather than general discussions for the whole group? \n\nWhile technically you would be doing to the same thing - staying at their place with them, it is entirely different in every way and much more awkward.", "If I were OP there would be no more visits ever again. NTA.", "I assume it's because there was a major snowstorm and major black outs in surrounding areas, it's not like you can easily find a hotel/motel under those conditions.\n\nAnd even if you could book a room online, or via phone, there is no telling if you will still have the room by the time you actually check in.", "Driving around for a hotel during a large major power outage in a surrounding area. \n\nThat must have been fun! Did you end up having to sleep in your car?", "It does seem like you are more irritated that they gave \"your\" room to the aunt than that they didn't tell you ahead of time. You are NTA for getting a room, being upset that they gave aunt the room when other family members could have taken her in is what your mom might be thinking is rude.", "This is such a humble and honest answer. I bet you are a pretty great person irl.", "Man, I had a few bad moments yesterday that were running across my mind before I read this comment. It really brightened me up. I certainly try, but I fall short sometimes. Thanks for that :).", "Or a cat in a hat?"]}
