Because we live so far apart, we know far in advance when we will visit one another. I booked this visit in August and everyone knew I was coming. They have two spare bedrooms.\n\nA few days before I was to arrive, there was a big winter storm in my SIL\u2019s hometown and electricity was knocked out for a lot of people in the dead of winter. My SIL\u2019s hometown is a couple hours away from where they live currently. I was told that her parents had come down to stay in the spare bedroom, which isn\u2019t a big deal because they\u2019re lovely people and there\u2019s two spare bedrooms. No big deal. \n\nWhen I arrived after a long day of traveling, I was told that my SIL\u2019s aunt had also come to stay and was in the other spare bedroom. I would be given a loft area and a blowup bed. I was furious but played it cool because the aunt is elderly and a very nice lady. I should mention that their extended family is huge. She has about ten options for where she could stay in the area and I had exactly one. They literally knew I was coming for six months and could very easily have said that they were expecting company. My SIL\u2019s sister has a house with several spare bedrooms. \n\nI politely, without making a scene, said I would be staying in a hotel for the first couple days of my visit. I\u2019m absolutely furious that they knew I\u2019d be given a blowup mattress in a loft and failed to mention it. I could have figured out other arrangements before I even got there. \n\nMy brother and my mom are saying I\u2019m an asshole for leaving two minutes after I got there and making the Aunt and parents feel bad. I understand that it was an accident of nature and they needed a place to stay but I\u2019m pissed because they had other options. I blame my brother and SIL for (I assume) not telling her family that I was coming and not telling me that both bedrooms were taken. \n\nI know in the history of AITA this isn\u2019t a huge deal but I\u2019m all alone in a hotel fuming and my mom, who\u2019s not involved in anything, is saying I\u2019m rude to a little old lady in her time of need.

Not for getting a hotel to stay in, but for leaving immediately. You could have made the hotel arrangements and spent time with your family before going to the hotel for the night.", "How were you rude to anyone? They offered you not an option. I'm in my 40s and I slept on a blow up bed last time I moved and it was terrible. People don't want to do that when they're in their 40s. \n\nThe mental gymnastics of you are rude because the three people in the house feel guilty about staying over when they should have been told a guest was coming and your brother should have told you what was up before you got there. \n\nWhy did they involve your mother when they apparently couldn't be bothered to communicate to anyone else? NTA. I'd go home.", "NTA.  They should have given you heads up.  I would have done the same.  I have a sister 300 miles away.  Shes ALWAYS got company- so I always book a room.  No biggie.", "Nope, NTA\n\nAnd I admire you remaining calm. After a day of travelling I would not have been happy to have this sprung on me.\n\nHow could they not have communicated this beforehand? It's 2023, everybody has a smartphone perpetually within reach.", "NTA\n\nBut try to spend time with them and don't fume about it", "NTA  if plans change then they should have told you.  Maybe they assumed you wouldn't mind an air mattress.  I know I do, I never sleep well.  I would do the same thing.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother could have avoided the whole thing with communication. Either to you (\"Hey OP! SIL and Aunt-IL have both rooms! Maybe you'd be more comfortable in a hotel, but if not, we've got you with an air mattress in the loft.\") OR to them (\"Yes, we have two spare rooms, by I have my sibling OP coming during that time. Perhaps you could go to another SIL's sister's house instead?\")\n\nInstead, you arrive to be told you get to sleep on an air mattress. \n\nI don't know about you, but I'm at the point in my life where I can appreciate the finer things in life like a real bed, and the ability to get out of it without assistance - to say nothing of the pain I'd be in for the rest of day if the bed was too hard or too soft, lumpy, or if it went flat like the last air mattress I slept on.", "NTA they should have given you some notice, you could have booked a hotel during your downtime traveling.  That said, it all worked out ok, I would try not to be fuming about it and furious for too long.  Yes it was inconsiderate, but I'm sure there's been a bit of chaos with the storms and taking care of elderly relatives.", "NTA They gave away a room that was already taken - by you. And after traveling 3k miles you want to sleep in a bet. They were bad host, giving your room away, not telling you and then calling you AH because you don't want to sleep on a air mattress with no privacy! And i don't know how it is with you, but i'm 41 and i could not sleep several days on a air mattress without being in awful pain. \n\nI still hope you have fun for the rest of your trip!", "INFO: Are you sure they truly had other options? I mean probably they were not the only ones looking for shelter.", "NTA\n\nThere is an age where sleeping on an uncomfortable sofa or air mattress for more than one night just doesn't work. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you created any kind of a scene. But it would have been nice if your brother/SIL had given you a heads up as it does sound like they knew of your coming well in advance or even put you up in the house where there were more spare guest rooms.", "NTA I understand your feelings after traveling all that way. But didn't they just had a big snow storm? Perhaps the aunt (being elderly) felt more comfortable with other people (mainly family) around. You said it was only a couple of days.", "Also, just to add... the next time they come to visit you, have their air mattress ready. I'm not petty, but I do believe in fair being fair.", "NTA as long as you didn't make a scene.   At 47 I wouldn't want to sleep on an air mattress either. Really your brother and SIL are the A H because, like you said, this whole thing could have been avoided if they had told you ahead of time that circumstances had changed.   If my husband and I had been in their shoes, we would have given up our room and slept on the air mattress before springing that on a guest.  Are you single? Because when I was single people always tried to put me in the inferior accommodations.", "NTA. It's not that you won't visit. It's that you won't be sleeping there. It may have been rude to leave immediately, without notice of where you were going or when you'd be back to visit...  But there's nothing wrong with staying at a hotel if there are no reasonable accommodations at the house.", "NTA. You handled this better than most people would have done.", "NTA! I would do the same. suffering and sacrificing \"for family' is dumb and manipulative.", "yta. yta yta. why don't you go back home instead of staying you're rude and a terrible guest", "NTA - now you know to book a hotel every time from this point forward.
