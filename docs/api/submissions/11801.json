She would complain about things like the chairs, noise (which is very little I have quiet neighbors) the way my furniture was, etc. so I stopped invited her over to my place and suggested we meet at my sisters house or somewhere else instead and why.

It feels like whenever you come to my home, all you do is complain, which makes it very hard for me to enjoy your visits.  The hotel is a compromise because I can still see you, and there aren't complaints about the beds and pillows, the internet, the pool, and so on.
