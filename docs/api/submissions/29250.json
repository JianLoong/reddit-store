They are giving him a LOT of money to put toward a house. I have money I want to put toward the house but he told me it isn\u2019t a lot (30k) or enough for a down payment. \n\nI haven\u2019t been involved in the process because his parents only speak Chinese and they have to use a Chinese realtor in my area. My BF usually gives me some type of summary of the conversations after we leave as translating in real time is too hard for him. He can\u2019t multi-task. So I\u2019m usually with them and have no idea what\u2019s going on.\n\nOn top of that, he says he can\u2019t put my name on the house because I have 20k student loan debt and it affects our approval. And because it\u2019s a prematurely asset, he doesn\u2019t want my name on it till we\u2019re married, which would be soon since we\u2019re getting engaged soon. But the house is for us as a married couple to live in. He also said he can\u2019t add my name to the deed after we\u2019re married cuz he would have refinance the house. He claims this is what everyone has told him and he has done is own research.\n\nLast night, I told him I\u2019m extremely hurt that I haven\u2019t been involved in the process of finding us a home. He has shown me three houses but has gotten mad when he asked me if I liked it and I said things I don\u2019t like - such as having no yard for my dog, which came before him. This isn\u2019t how I pictured finding a house with a future husband. I wanted to be involved. Stress about stuff together. Find things we like and don\u2019t like. Enjoy it and have fun. But he has been the one doing it all with his parents. I just want an equal partnership. I want a best friend who will ask me things and not get mad. I want someone who will be excited about things with me. Not someone who tells me to stop crying cuz I\u2019m sharing my feelings and he can\u2019t talk to me like that. \n\nI have communicated that I might not move into the house until we\u2019re married. So he is aware of that. But he also can\u2019t afford the house without me. He has to sign for a house he found by Nov. 30.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the one being the AS by wanting my name on the house and being an equal partner in the relationship. He just claims he is doing the logical thing for our relationship and for our future. He wants to be the one to provide for us since I (55K) make less than him (75k). \n\nSo\u2026 am I the AS?\n\nThanks for any advice and opinions. \ud83e\udec2\n\nEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I live in the USA in Florida! He parents came the USA when BF was 4. They own a business but speak VERY limited English. \n\nUpdating for the language: they speak Wenzhounese and mandarin.", "created_utc": 1697723183, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bjj7u/aita_for_wanting_my_name_on_the_house/", "score": 258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are so many red flags in this post it isn't even funny.\n\n1) You should not even be considering giving one cent of your down payment money towards a house where your name isn't on the deed. Not one cent. \n\n2) You should be picking out the house. This nonsense about him and the realtor picking it out and it having nothing you want... why are you even with this jerk?\n\n3) You state you are in therapy and nothing is getting better.

Think of it that way and discuss what your rent/contribution will be when you move in, not how it can also belong to you. \n2. If you say yes to his proposal, be ready for a very thorough prenup if you haven\u2019t already seen that coming a mile away.\n3. Not letting you participate in the selection of the house that you are both expected to live in, regardless of who\u2019s funding it, is NOT a thing that an actual life partner does.

However this is very much *his* house, not your future family home.\n\nYou are NTA for wanting a say in choosing the house that will become your marital home, that should absolutely be a joint venture. You want a equal partnership.  your boyfriends doesn't want that - he wants to be in charge of everything and you just graciously agree that he knows best.\n\nIt is extremely concerning to me that he wants to be the \"provider\" in your marriage (which I am assuming means your reducing/quitting work) but won't provide you with the financial security of having your name on the house once you are married. That is extremely dangerous for you to agree to.\n\nFundamentally, sounds like you and your boyfriend are not remotely on the same page in this relationship.

If a similar place would rent for $3,000 in your area, don't pay more than $1,500 + 1/2 utilities. \n\nWhen you break up (which he's planning for) you'll walk away with nothing. \n\nIt's complete BS that his parents say \"your money isn't enough\". If you put $30k more into the down payment it will save money in the long run. Theres no reason to deny that money, except to deny you any stake in ownership. \n\nHis parents suck. And either he sucks, or is being manipulated by them. \n\nYou are not part of his future plans.", "NTA.

I hope you can sit down with him and fully communicate how you're not happy with this process/potentially the biggest purchase of your life. \n\nWhile he's done his own research when it comes to housing/mortgage - it wouldn't hurt to do more research on your own. Maybe consult with some friends who are realtors/mortgage brokers just to learn more? Knowledge is power. \n\nHang in there friend.", "If he was my friend, I would tell him not to put your name on the deed either.

This whole situation is a waste of time. You're not in a relationship with a compatible partner. He's not giving you what you need, and is moving forward to purchase assets, that you won't benefit from. Wake up! \n\nAnd unless your 30k is earning more interest than the 20k is costing you, it's not financially responsible to keep that debt. Why wouldn't you pay off your student debt and build back your savings to buy a house, where you can ensure your name is on the title. Secure yourself and your finances, before getting entangled with a wishy washy guy who only needs you for what you can contribute to a house you'll never own.", "This is never going to change.

That way you have the same safety net he has, and you can rent it out for income.

He\u2019s also wrong that changing a deed would require a refinance; the mortgage and the deed are separate things. Do not give him a single cent of your money unless he\u2019s willing to put your name on the deed.

But if your name isn't on the house, you shouldn't be putting in much financially. Sure, you can pay some form of \"rent\" but it should be no more than like 1/3 of the mortgage payment, you shouldn't pay taxes or maintenance fees, and then furnishing the house should be split 50/50.

They are giving him a LOT of money to put toward a house. I have money I want to put toward the house but he told me it isn\u2019t a lot (30k) or enough for a down payment. \n\nI haven\u2019t been involved in the process because his parents only speak Chinese and they have to use a Chinese realtor in my area. My BF usually gives me some type of summary of the conversations after we leave as translating in real time is too hard for him. He can\u2019t multi-task. So I\u2019m usually with them and have no idea what\u2019s going on.\n\nOn top of that, he says he can\u2019t put my name on the house because I have 20k student loan debt and it affects our approval. And because it\u2019s a prematurely asset, he doesn\u2019t want my name on it till we\u2019re married, which would be soon since we\u2019re getting engaged soon. But the house is for us as a married couple to live in. He also said he can\u2019t add my name to the deed after we\u2019re married cuz he would have refinance the house. He claims this is what everyone has told him and he has done is own research.\n\nLast night, I told him I\u2019m extremely hurt that I haven\u2019t been involved in the process of finding us a home. He has shown me three houses but has gotten mad when he asked me if I liked it and I said things I don\u2019t like - such as having no yard for my dog, which came before him. This isn\u2019t how I pictured finding a house with a future husband. I wanted to be involved. Stress about stuff together. Find things we like and don\u2019t like. Enjoy it and have fun. But he has been the one doing it all with his parents. I just want an equal partnership. I want a best friend who will ask me things and not get mad. I want someone who will be excited about things with me. Not someone who tells me to stop crying cuz I\u2019m sharing my feelings and he can\u2019t talk to me like that. \n\nI have communicated that I might not move into the house until we\u2019re married. So he is aware of that. But he also can\u2019t afford the house without me. He has to sign for a house he found by Nov. 30.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the one being the AS by wanting my name on the house and being an equal partner in the relationship. He just claims he is doing the logical thing for our relationship and for our future. He wants to be the one to provide for us since I (55K) make less than him (75k). \n\nSo\u2026 am I the AS?\n\nThanks for any advice and opinions. \ud83e\udec2\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he's the one paying (his parents really) then I don't see why your name needs to be there.\nIf you were paying half or close to it then yes, he must put your name on the house.\nStill, he started searching for a house for the two of you knowing he will be the one (his parents) to pay for it while you still can't afford to help, legally it's going to be his house but it's a house for the two of you to live and start a family, so he needs to actively involve you in the matter and he's an AH for not doing that, he's also an AH because I really don't think he's ever gonna put your name on that house, and he's not right to pretend he will just so he wouldn't have to explain why he doesn't feel it would be fair for him.\nBut there are alot of red flags in this relationship OP, not only regarding the house, but also you and your SO's relationship with his family, it's not hard to translate to you what they're saying, the fact that he didn't see the need to do more than a summary after you leave means his parents doesn't really care to have any kind of conversation with you, and that's really not a normal thing when meeting a lady that may be your future DIL, and it's weird they want bother to speak the language of the country you all live in now so you can be included, surly after living there for so long they're capable of holding an understandable enough conversation?", "If you\u2019re putting in $30k of the downpayment without which he can\u2019t buy the house and you will be contributing toward the mortgage payment as well as any maintenance and/or repairs, it seems to me your name should be on the deed. As it stands, he\u2019s asking you to make a substantial investment with the possibility of no return if your relationship falls apart, which is a significant risk. In my opinion, that\u2019s not reasonable of him. Also, if he buys the house before you marry the house becomes something he owns that would not be considered a marital asset to be divided in case of divorce. I think you should consult a lawyer of your own so that you understand the risk you would be assuming if you agree to your boyfriend\u2019s suggestion and how or if you can protect your $30k investment. I\u2019m a bit concerned , by what you wrote, that your boyfriend is bullying/coercing you in a number of ways and doesn\u2019t seem to be ensuring that your interests are being protected here or that your voice is being heard in this process.

The things you acquire during the marriage (whether it be an asset or a debt) are split equally. If his parents donate $150k when you guys are married, it becomes a joint asset. If only your BF and parents are on the house and it's bought prior to marriage, then they retain the asset if you ever split. If your BF inherits the money in the event of their deaths, regardless if you're married, the money would be his only, unless it's spent on joint assets, like a house or car, then the equity would be half yours.\n\nA possible solution to this situation is to agree to not be on this particular home (will it be your forever home or a starter home?), but if he wants you to contribute in payment, he'd need to agree to allow you input into which home is selected. You'd have to accept that you'd be paying \"rent\", of course, as you wouldn't have ownership. It could be that he's doing this at the pressure of his parents to protect family money. \n\nSeeing a financial advisor would also help as these things should be discussed PRIOR to getting married.

He thinks there is a deadline on buying this house so you are being pressured to consent to it (presumably regarding your contributing to the mortgage) even though you will not be on the deed.\n4.

Why can't you wait until BOTH of you are eligible for a loan, like most couples do?\n9. Let's assume he buys this house in November as planned, and that, as you indicate in the lower part of your post, you are meant to pay towards the mortgage even though you will not yet be married and you may not even be living there. Why is it ok for him to ask you to pay towards a mortgage for a house in which you have no legal ownership but it is too risky for him to put you on the deed because you're not married yet? This is a very asymmetric deal in my view.\n10. He tells you to stop crying when you share that you don't feel you're being treated like an equal, when you say that you are not happy with a house (that you're going to help pay for) that is unsuitable for your dog, etc.\n11.

Still, even $15k, which is written off as a gift, is a huge different in a down payment that can drastically lower your monthly payment if you're going for an average home. It'll cover closing costs and then some.\n\nIf it's the latter, though, he's being really disingenuous by not giving you any ownership but expecting your financial support.

And your BF is right that if you're not initially on the mortgage, then he can't add you to that without affecting your financing as the OG mortgage would have been calculated by the lender based on his sole income. \n\nBut a mortgage is your agreement to repay a financial lender.

This works for us, because my boyfriend does NOT want to own a home or be responsible for repairs, or snow removal, or lawn mowing. He wants to live in a place where he is not responsible for anything but rent. This is the home that my children and I have lived in before we started dating.

What are you getting out of this relationship?", "Sorry to break it to you, but this house situation is his way of telling you he doesn't want to marry you. My ex used to tell me he didn't want to have kids for many years, if ever. What he was really saying is \"I don't want to have kids with YOU.\"  This is his cowardly way of backing out of the relationship without confronting you. Even if he really does love you, men and women from Asia (including India) tend to have very different relationships with their parents and they could very well be bullying him into this. \n\nBut are you surprised? You guys are unhappy, and his parents don't see you as long term partners. Of course they want to protect their money. \n\nBut absolute DO NOT contribute money to a home you're not on the deed of. My husband is not on my loan for similar reasons why your BF doesn't want you on his, but he IS on the deed (required legally once married but still). We both pay the mortgage. \n\nLeave this guy. Don't let this hurt you further. Or stop discussing it and save your money and then buy your own place. Far away.", "No, his parents are giving HIM the gift of $150. This is entirely for him. He isn't taking your feelings into account and asking you if you like the house. He is picking the house HE likes. He may not even plan for you to be around for long. He wants your financial contribution so that he can pay his property taxes, but a true partner would be asking what you think every step of the way.\n\nI can see both sides on why the parents may not want you on the deed if the relationship is unstable. They may fear that you guys will break up, and they've just lost $75K, which is reasonable. The other side of that is that realistically, you two should not be taking big steps like buying real estate together or getting engaged if the relationship is unstable. Taking those steps isn't going to put a bandaid on your problems. You need to fix your relationship problems, or if they can't be fixed, go your separate ways.

If I was giving my son $150k to buy a house with his wife/gf who couldn't hardly put up a fifth of what I am I'd probably be cautioning my child as well.

Is the way he\u2019s been house hunting indicative of the way he treats you in this relationship? The way he approaches problems is not going to drastically change once he marries. Taking someone else\u2019s feelings and thoughts into consideration is such a basic relationship skill. If he can\u2019t show he\u2019s a good life partner to you, don\u2019t tie your life to him.

Houses are selling for more than they should, especially in FL. Taxes on homes have also skyrocketed. When the housing bubble came to a massive crash in 2008, many people couldn't even sell their homes bc of the huge drops in value. If this happens again, the house would not be an asset. He would be left with the debt while you could walk away. If he couldn't maintain the house, then it would reflect poorly on his credit, but not yours. There would only be a benefit to refinancing later. So that argument is super weak, on his behalf.\n\nAlso, if he needs your income to help pay, how will he qualify for the loan without you on it? Will he make all financial decisions without your input?\n\nIf you truly love him, then no one will be able to talk you out of marrying him. But protect yourself and your dog!

Either way, with 20k of student loan, the odds of it impacting the qualification is low, especially if you have no other debt.   \n\nThe odds of this statement being true are very low.   \nIt's possible. Unlikely.

From a few minutes of google, it sounds like you are entitled to some of the appreciation after the marriage, even if you're not on the deed.  \nIf your boyfriend is not an owner and it is only the in-laws, marriage or not, you have no right to the property.   \nIf it is split, sounds like you would only get ~1/6 of any appreciation after the marriage; boyfriend is 1/3 owner, and you get 50% of his share. 1/3 x 50% = 1/6. \n\nThere are pros and cons to not being on the deed or mortgage.   \nThere are ways for this to benefit you.   \nThey generally only work if both parties (you + boyfriend) know the plan and why you're not on anything.\n\nIf you have any more questions, please free to ask.", "Sit back for a moment and read what you just posted aloud.\n\n**We\u2019re going through rough patches and couples therapy trying to work on communication that hasn\u2019t gotten better.**\n\nYou're already going to therapy and it isn't getting better.

He needs your income to ahora the payments. If that's true, it means your name must be on the loan/note. Plus, unless you sign an agreement to be on the loan but not on the ownership, it is impossible. Plus if your student loans will hinder the loan process, he can't bring your income to the table. There are reasons to bring a person into a loan and reasons not. \nFor instance, if your income is 2k a month and your student loan payment is 2200, then you shouldn't be on the loan as you only bring a negative. However if student loan payment is 500 each month and your income is 3000 after withholdings, that means you bring 2500 each month to show more ability to make the payment. \nThere are many more issues though:\nWho's credit score is better?\nWhat debt do each of you bring?\nWhat are incomes for you both?\nHow much of your inconsistent are each of you ready to give in payments and home-ownership costs. Such as utilities, trash collection, hoa costs, maintenance, repair, insurance, taxes, etc?\nWill his parents be banned as owners or Co-borrowers?\n\nPersonally, this would be a good reason to walk away from the relationship. Years ago when my fiance bought a home, I didn't speak up on anything, as at the time I figured we weren't married yet so I didn't want to have a say. \nHowever, I feel your bf should consider your feelings.

If the wife is expected to make the most money, what did bf think of that? Let's say, for example,  he's bringing in 30k annually, while she brings in 150k. What are his current thought of thoughts? Now she gets pregnant but needs to be on bed rest, who would do the housework? If hubby makes 150k and wife 30k and needs need rest per doctor orders, is there any difference from previous answers? If wife made most money but all had to cook and do dishes, etc, what happens if later she must take maternity leave or go on bed rest? Should there be a special savings account to save money for such medical issues no matter who has to take time off work?

You\u2019ll be along for the ride and not an equal partner with an equal say. It feels like this is the test of how far he can push the lines with you. If you have no say before marriage, you\u2019ll more than likely have less down the line. If he\u2019s letting his parents dictate this much already, imagine how much worse it will get when you have children. Also how do you feel about having to take care of them as they age, as they are helping to buy the house they are probably expecting to live there as well. In most, not all Asian cultures most of the tending to elders/housework falls on the women. \n\nIf you\u2019re already experiencing an unequal share of household duties it will get much worse down the line.

It seems as though he is using that as an excuse to keep you off in case things go south with your relationship. As in your money goes toward the house but you have no legal claim to said house. Do not put any money in unless you have a written agreement stating you expect to be bought out of your share plus interest should it not work out. 30k is too much money to give away without having the ability to gain it back or have the equity in the home go to your BF and his parents. More so, if you are contributing money to the home you are also entitled to any gains the property may incur over the life of ownership. \n\nIt might behoove you to use your savings to pay down your student loans with less interest now than to wait and pay over time.

When y\u2019all get married that is the only time you can discuss splitting other costs associated with homeownership. But! If your name doesn\u2019t get put on the deed (neither before nor after marriage), you need to keep track of every dime you put into maintaining the home, like rent you paid, taxes you helped pay, home improvements you helped pay by getting signed receipts for what the money was for, because if you guys did divorce, a court could then see his separate asset as a community asset, and you\u2019d be entitled to a certain portion of the value of the home at the time of the divorce, especially if improvements you contributed increased the value of the home (this is in most cases within divorce proceedings, especially if you contributed a significant amount). If he really wants to protect his premarital asset, you wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything regarding the home except for power, water, internet (utility bills).\n\nUntil y\u2019all are married, the only thing you would have to contribute would be fair rent once you move in, which is usually half the mortgage plus an average of half the bills.\n\nIf he can\u2019t afford the home without you, then he either needs to 1.

Not for taxes, home owners insurance, home improvements, or other home buying fees.\n\nHe cannot ask you/demand you to contribute to those things when you have no legal obligation.

No, I don\u2019t want that. This is my home, not your\u2019s. Want to put up a certain decoration? No, I don\u2019t like that. This is my home, not your\u2019s.

If he says he would not want to pay you for a portion of its value, but he still wants you to help with mortgage, taxes, etc. then you say you need to keep getting receipts. If he asks why you\u2019re wanting receipts, you need to tell him, since I\u2019ve contributed this much to a home I have no legal holding on, I will need to make sure I can get reimbursed  for my contribution in case of divorce.

You don't have enough to be a partner in this investment. \n\nYour therapist should stick to relationship advice not financial advice.  Yes, keep your money. If you live in the home, you will owe something for expenses, but it shouldn't be a morgage payment. Honestly, It doesn't sound like this is a good partnership.", "Ahhh\u2026 yeah, he has a very narrow idea of his power or is being untruthful.", "So your boyfriend lied to your couples therapist?", "Oh HELL no.", "Listen to your gut feelings!", "It is true. It won\u2019t be your house, it\u2019ll be his, and even if that wasn\u2019t the case, he clearly doesn\u2019t want to share decision-making.", "she doesn't need to have name on mortgage to have name on deed--totally different things.", "Wrong, he can afford the house, but if they live together, he needs help servicing the loan. He could always get a Flatmate without her which is completely safe and fine. He does not \u2018need\u2019 \u2018her\u2019", "While you may have had certain experiences with traditional Chinese families, it\u2019s essential to approach OP\u2019s situation on its own merits. We don\u2019t actually know if they\u2019re traditional Chinese families.\n\nAssumptions based on personal experiences can sometimes cloud objective judgment. However, it is apparent that there are deep-seated issues in this relationship that extend beyond just the house purchase, and they need addressing, especially with impending plans for marriage.\n\nSo, I respect your experience but we can\u2019t make up parts of the story on OP\u2019s behalf - you have to evaluate it based only in what was written.", "Just because you buy furniture doesn\u2019t mean you did anything to the house. I know it feels like it, but if they breakup, she can take everything with her. She can\u2019t \u2018take the house\u2019. It\u2019s wildly different. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep these things separate!", "So she\u2019s going to not move into the house with him, but he still expect her to pay rent, and you think that\u2019s reasonable?", "Based on what is written\n\nop has no input. Deals are made in mandarin, realtor is talking mandarin.\n\n  \nbf is looking for a house \u201cwith his parents\u201d , maybe I am wrong but I get that they would be on the deed. If I am wrong it is still very alarming that the parents are getting the main hand on choosing this house (by dealing with someone in their main langage and cutting off op from conversation)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthen, yes, there is also the fact that traditionnal Chinese families often work like that and that they are already so implicated in their son\u2019s life isn\u2019t very encouraging.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nall in all, I wouldn\u2019t buy a house with a bf, or let them cut me out of the conversations with the realtor if I did.", "If you have children with him, it will be even worse, because his parents will be the authority on how to raise their son\u2019s offspring & nothing you do will \u201cbe right\u201d in their eyes\u2026have children with a partner that adores you.", "So since it's his house what happens if he decides the dog can't live there anymore?", "She would only pay rent if she was living there obviously.\nShe tried to push back that she wouldn't live in the house until they were married if he didn't put her on the deed. Pushing him to propose maybe? Thats ick.\nI personally think she's got some entitlement expecting to be on his house  when their relationship is as rocky as it is and she's just the gf in a newish relationship. 2 years in and she expects to be proposed to, married, and on the house? Lol no\nGuy will make it work with or without her. He seems to be full speed ahead with the house thing. If he needs some assistance with monthly mortgage payments, he can get a roommate. He makes 75k a year. She makes 55k. I think he'll be fine. I'm expecting the \"We broke up\" Update before years end.", "No, confusing affording the house with servicing the loan. He can clearly buy the house on his own with parents. He wants help with monthly payments - completely different", "Meeting the income level to get the loan I bet. If so then on the deed or no house. He wants to tie OP to the debt, without allowing OP to be on the deed.\n\nEdit: to correct mistakes", "The dog came before him and is my ESA. So he isn\u2019t going anywhere. I will leave", "No it doesn\u2019t, sounds like they\u2019re in a relationship and he wants her to contribute to servicing the loan. They\u2019re not married and she only has 30k to contribute which he clearly identified is trivial when compared to the amount he and family are contributing. It makes no sense to add someone onto a loan because of \u2018feelings\u2019. It\u2019s a solid business decision and any financial advisor or lawyer would agree.", "Just a gf or two years. She has no money and significant debt. Family is buying house for son and they\u2019re not dumb enough to bring \u201cnot wife\u201d of a whole 2 years into a 30 year commitment of family credit and net worth. Simple story, gf meets guy whose family can help him buy a house and wants her name on it so she can share in the financial security his family is helping him attain. \n\nIf boyfriends and girlfriends are ready to share in 30 year commitments they start calling themselves spouses.", "Again, she's not on any paperwork. So she's not tied to it. \nHe refused her money. He most likely is expecting her to pay \"rent\" (like she would anywhere else) which would go towards \nthe monthly mortgage payment.\nHe's on the paperwork and so are his parents. She is not. She is the gf of 2 years in an unhappy relationship. Do you think his parents DONT know that they are in couples therapy already? Couples therapy that she said isn't working..", "I agree. I don't blame him for not wanting her name on the deed considering his parents are paying for a huge chunk of the house and they aren't even engaged yet. Considering they're unhappy in what is normally still the honeymoon stage of their relationship, there is a good chance they will end up breaking up and she could get half his parents' money and force the sale of the house. If I were his parents, I wouldn't give the money if his GF's name was on the lease. It's a completely different story if they were happily married. If he was anyone in here's brother or best friend, I'm sure we would all advise against it! That said, I do think OP should rethink this relationship all together, but this is not the hill to die on.", "This is the correct response. He can afford the loan, he wants help servicing the payments.", "She's talking about marriage not him if he was they would have been engaged BUT THEY ARE IN COUPLE TERAPY and I can almost bet it's because she wants to manipulate him in a lot of thing", "I\u2019m a lawyer. I do not agree.", "Then they don\u2019t get any of her money.", "Yep. Which is why they are refusing her money and refusing putting her on anything. They are being smart. They did do their research and probably have a lawyer in the wings. \nBased that the relationship was already shaking before this, this should be an eye opener for both sides."]}
