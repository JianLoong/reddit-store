They are giving him a LOT of money to put toward a house. I have money I want to put toward the house but he told me it isn\u2019t a lot (30k) or enough for a down payment. \n\nI haven\u2019t been involved in the process because his parents only speak Chinese and they have to use a Chinese realtor in my area. My BF usually gives me some type of summary of the conversations after we leave as translating in real time is too hard for him. He can\u2019t multi-task. So I\u2019m usually with them and have no idea what\u2019s going on.\n\nOn top of that, he says he can\u2019t put my name on the house because I have 20k student loan debt and it affects our approval. And because it\u2019s a prematurely asset, he doesn\u2019t want my name on it till we\u2019re married, which would be soon since we\u2019re getting engaged soon. But the house is for us as a married couple to live in. He also said he can\u2019t add my name to the deed after we\u2019re married cuz he would have refinance the house. He claims this is what everyone has told him and he has done is own research.\n\nLast night, I told him I\u2019m extremely hurt that I haven\u2019t been involved in the process of finding us a home. He has shown me three houses but has gotten mad when he asked me if I liked it and I said things I don\u2019t like - such as having no yard for my dog, which came before him. This isn\u2019t how I pictured finding a house with a future husband. I wanted to be involved. Stress about stuff together. Find things we like and don\u2019t like. Enjoy it and have fun. But he has been the one doing it all with his parents. I just want an equal partnership. I want a best friend who will ask me things and not get mad. I want someone who will be excited about things with me. Not someone who tells me to stop crying cuz I\u2019m sharing my feelings and he can\u2019t talk to me like that. \n\nI have communicated that I might not move into the house until we\u2019re married. So he is aware of that. But he also can\u2019t afford the house without me. He has to sign for a house he found by Nov. 30.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the one being the AS by wanting my name on the house and being an equal partner in the relationship. He just claims he is doing the logical thing for our relationship and for our future. He wants to be the one to provide for us since I (55K) make less than him (75k). \n\nSo\u2026 am I the AS?\n\nThanks for any advice and opinions. \ud83e\udec2\n\nEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I live in the USA in Florida! He parents came the USA when BF was 4. They own a business but speak VERY limited English. \n\nUpdating for the language: they speak Wenzhounese and mandarin.", "created_utc": 1697723183, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bjj7u/aita_for_wanting_my_name_on_the_house/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are so many red flags in this post it isn't even funny.\n\n1) You should not even be considering giving one cent of your down payment money towards a house where your name isn't on the deed. Not one cent. \n\n2) You should be picking out the house. This nonsense about him and the realtor picking it out and it having nothing you want... why are you even with this jerk?\n\n3) You state you are in therapy and nothing is getting better. Why are you moving forward with HUGE steps like buying a house with YOUR money that isn't even in your name or MARRYING this guy? You should be taking steps backwards if this guy isn't showing you he wants to make the relationship better. \n\n**I would take my money and my dog and tell this guy that it isn't working. Don't make the huge mistake of giving over your savings to buy someone else a house!**", "I don\u2019t know what to judge here, but a few thoughts:\n\n1. His parents are buying him a house. Think of it that way and discuss what your rent/contribution will be when you move in, not how it can also belong to you. \n2. If you say yes to his proposal, be ready for a very thorough prenup if you haven\u2019t already seen that coming a mile away.\n3. Not letting you participate in the selection of the house that you are both expected to live in, regardless of who\u2019s funding it, is NOT a thing that an actual life partner does. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t worry about 1 & 2 because I\u2019d be looking for my own housing separately.", "Your boyfriend is buying a house with his parents, and it is fine for him to not put you on the deed if you have not contributed any money towards the purchase of the property.  However this is very much *his* house, not your future family home.\n\nYou are NTA for wanting a say in choosing the house that will become your marital home, that should absolutely be a joint venture. You want a equal partnership.  your boyfriends doesn't want that - he wants to be in charge of everything and you just graciously agree that he knows best.\n\nIt is extremely concerning to me that he wants to be the \"provider\" in your marriage (which I am assuming means your reducing/quitting work) but won't provide you with the financial security of having your name on the house once you are married. That is extremely dangerous for you to agree to.\n\nFundamentally, sounds like you and your boyfriend are not remotely on the same page in this relationship.

DO NOT pay more than what half the rent would be. If a similar place would rent for $3,000 in your area, don't pay more than $1,500 + 1/2 utilities. \n\nWhen you break up (which he's planning for) you'll walk away with nothing. \n\nIt's complete BS that his parents say \"your money isn't enough\". If you put $30k more into the down payment it will save money in the long run. Theres no reason to deny that money, except to deny you any stake in ownership. \n\nHis parents suck. And either he sucks, or is being manipulated by them. \n\nYou are not part of his future plans.", "NTA.

In case everything goes to shit if you don't have your name on the house it'll only be to your detriment. \n\nYou're right, buying a home is a huge decision and I can understand your frustration of not being a part of the process/not feeling heard/seen. I hope you can sit down with him and fully communicate how you're not happy with this process/potentially the biggest purchase of your life. \n\nWhile he's done his own research when it comes to housing/mortgage - it wouldn't hurt to do more research on your own. Maybe consult with some friends who are realtors/mortgage brokers just to learn more? Knowledge is power. \n\nHang in there friend.", "If he was my friend, I would tell him not to put your name on the deed either.

This whole situation is a waste of time. You're not in a relationship with a compatible partner. He's not giving you what you need, and is moving forward to purchase assets, that you won't benefit from. Wake up! \n\nAnd unless your 30k is earning more interest than the 20k is costing you, it's not financially responsible to keep that debt. Why wouldn't you pay off your student debt and build back your savings to buy a house, where you can ensure your name is on the title. Secure yourself and your finances, before getting entangled with a wishy washy guy who only needs you for what you can contribute to a house you'll never own.", "This is never going to change. He is showing you the relationship you will always have with him, even after you get married. It will always be conversations between him and his parents with you being left out.

That way you have the same safety net he has, and you can rent it out for income.

He\u2019s also wrong that changing a deed would require a refinance; the mortgage and the deed are separate things. Do not give him a single cent of your money unless he\u2019s willing to put your name on the deed.

But if your name isn't on the house, you shouldn't be putting in much financially. Sure, you can pay some form of \"rent\" but it should be no more than like 1/3 of the mortgage payment, you shouldn't pay taxes or maintenance fees, and then furnishing the house should be split 50/50.

They are giving him a LOT of money to put toward a house. I have money I want to put toward the house but he told me it isn\u2019t a lot (30k) or enough for a down payment. \n\nI haven\u2019t been involved in the process because his parents only speak Chinese and they have to use a Chinese realtor in my area. My BF usually gives me some type of summary of the conversations after we leave as translating in real time is too hard for him. He can\u2019t multi-task. So I\u2019m usually with them and have no idea what\u2019s going on.\n\nOn top of that, he says he can\u2019t put my name on the house because I have 20k student loan debt and it affects our approval. And because it\u2019s a prematurely asset, he doesn\u2019t want my name on it till we\u2019re married, which would be soon since we\u2019re getting engaged soon. But the house is for us as a married couple to live in. He also said he can\u2019t add my name to the deed after we\u2019re married cuz he would have refinance the house. He claims this is what everyone has told him and he has done is own research.\n\nLast night, I told him I\u2019m extremely hurt that I haven\u2019t been involved in the process of finding us a home. He has shown me three houses but has gotten mad when he asked me if I liked it and I said things I don\u2019t like - such as having no yard for my dog, which came before him. This isn\u2019t how I pictured finding a house with a future husband. I wanted to be involved. Stress about stuff together. Find things we like and don\u2019t like. Enjoy it and have fun. But he has been the one doing it all with his parents. I just want an equal partnership. I want a best friend who will ask me things and not get mad. I want someone who will be excited about things with me. Not someone who tells me to stop crying cuz I\u2019m sharing my feelings and he can\u2019t talk to me like that. \n\nI have communicated that I might not move into the house until we\u2019re married. So he is aware of that. But he also can\u2019t afford the house without me. He has to sign for a house he found by Nov. 30.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the one being the AS by wanting my name on the house and being an equal partner in the relationship. He just claims he is doing the logical thing for our relationship and for our future. He wants to be the one to provide for us since I (55K) make less than him (75k). \n\nSo\u2026 am I the AS?\n\nThanks for any advice and opinions. \ud83e\udec2\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he's the one paying (his parents really) then I don't see why your name needs to be there.\nIf you were paying half or close to it then yes, he must put your name on the house.\nStill, he started searching for a house for the two of you knowing he will be the one (his parents) to pay for it while you still can't afford to help, legally it's going to be his house but it's a house for the two of you to live and start a family, so he needs to actively involve you in the matter and he's an AH for not doing that, he's also an AH because I really don't think he's ever gonna put your name on that house, and he's not right to pretend he will just so he wouldn't have to explain why he doesn't feel it would be fair for him.\nBut there are alot of red flags in this relationship OP, not only regarding the house, but also you and your SO's relationship with his family, it's not hard to translate to you what they're saying, the fact that he didn't see the need to do more than a summary after you leave means his parents doesn't really care to have any kind of conversation with you, and that's really not a normal thing when meeting a lady that may be your future DIL, and it's weird they want bother to speak the language of the country you all live in now so you can be included, surly after living there for so long they're capable of holding an understandable enough conversation?", "If you\u2019re putting in $30k of the downpayment without which he can\u2019t buy the house and you will be contributing toward the mortgage payment as well as any maintenance and/or repairs, it seems to me your name should be on the deed. As it stands, he\u2019s asking you to make a substantial investment with the possibility of no return if your relationship falls apart, which is a significant risk. In my opinion, that\u2019s not reasonable of him. Also, if he buys the house before you marry the house becomes something he owns that would not be considered a marital asset to be divided in case of divorce. I think you should consult a lawyer of your own so that you understand the risk you would be assuming if you agree to your boyfriend\u2019s suggestion and how or if you can protect your $30k investment. I\u2019m a bit concerned , by what you wrote, that your boyfriend is bullying/coercing you in a number of ways and doesn\u2019t seem to be ensuring that your interests are being protected here or that your voice is being heard in this process.

The things you acquire during the marriage (whether it be an asset or a debt) are split equally. If his parents donate $150k when you guys are married, it becomes a joint asset. If only your BF and parents are on the house and it's bought prior to marriage, then they retain the asset if you ever split. If your BF inherits the money in the event of their deaths, regardless if you're married, the money would be his only, unless it's spent on joint assets, like a house or car, then the equity would be half yours.\n\nA possible solution to this situation is to agree to not be on this particular home (will it be your forever home or a starter home?), but if he wants you to contribute in payment, he'd need to agree to allow you input into which home is selected. You'd have to accept that you'd be paying \"rent\", of course, as you wouldn't have ownership. It could be that he's doing this at the pressure of his parents to protect family money. \n\nSeeing a financial advisor would also help as these things should be discussed PRIOR to getting married.

He thinks there is a deadline on buying this house so you are being pressured to consent to it (presumably regarding your contributing to the mortgage) even though you will not be on the deed.\n4.

Why can't you wait until BOTH of you are eligible for a loan, like most couples do?\n9. Let's assume he buys this house in November as planned, and that, as you indicate in the lower part of your post, you are meant to pay towards the mortgage even though you will not yet be married and you may not even be living there. Why is it ok for him to ask you to pay towards a mortgage for a house in which you have no legal ownership but it is too risky for him to put you on the deed because you're not married yet? This is a very asymmetric deal in my view.\n10. He tells you to stop crying when you share that you don't feel you're being treated like an equal, when you say that you are not happy with a house (that you're going to help pay for) that is unsuitable for your dog, etc.\n11.

Still, even $15k, which is written off as a gift, is a huge different in a down payment that can drastically lower your monthly payment if you're going for an average home. It'll cover closing costs and then some.\n\nIf it's the latter, though, he's being really disingenuous by not giving you any ownership but expecting your financial support.

And your BF is right that if you're not initially on the mortgage, then he can't add you to that without affecting your financing as the OG mortgage would have been calculated by the lender based on his sole income. \n\nBut a mortgage is your agreement to repay a financial lender.

He hasn\u2019t paid for a single furnishing, he doesn\u2019t pay mortgage taxes, he doesn\u2019t pay any utilities, he doesn\u2019t contribute towards repairs, he simply pays me rent which is a little less than 1/4 of my typical monthly expenses. This works for us, because my boyfriend does NOT want to own a home or be responsible for repairs, or snow removal, or lawn mowing. He wants to live in a place where he is not responsible for anything but rent. This is the home that my children and I have lived in before we started dating.

What are you getting out of this relationship?", "Sorry to break it to you, but this house situation is his way of telling you he doesn't want to marry you. My ex used to tell me he didn't want to have kids for many years, if ever. What he was really saying is \"I don't want to have kids with YOU.\"  This is his cowardly way of backing out of the relationship without confronting you. Even if he really does love you, men and women from Asia (including India) tend to have very different relationships with their parents and they could very well be bullying him into this. \n\nBut are you surprised? You guys are unhappy, and his parents don't see you as long term partners. Of course they want to protect their money. \n\nBut absolute DO NOT contribute money to a home you're not on the deed of. My husband is not on my loan for similar reasons why your BF doesn't want you on his, but he IS on the deed (required legally once married but still). We both pay the mortgage. \n\nLeave this guy. Don't let this hurt you further. Or stop discussing it and save your money and then buy your own place. Far away.", "No, his parents are giving HIM the gift of $150. This is entirely for him. He isn't taking your feelings into account and asking you if you like the house. He is picking the house HE likes. He may not even plan for you to be around for long. He wants your financial contribution so that he can pay his property taxes, but a true partner would be asking what you think every step of the way.\n\nI can see both sides on why the parents may not want you on the deed if the relationship is unstable. They may fear that you guys will break up, and they've just lost $75K, which is reasonable. The other side of that is that realistically, you two should not be taking big steps like buying real estate together or getting engaged if the relationship is unstable. Taking those steps isn't going to put a bandaid on your problems. You need to fix your relationship problems, or if they can't be fixed, go your separate ways.

Your financial responsibility should not include any owner costs: taxes of any kind, and repairs or maintenance on the home, etc. If you don't plan to move in till marriage as you mentioned, you'll still want to keep track of those kinds of \"owner\" payments, as that may give you some partial ownership depending on your local laws.

In fact it can be hard work and you both need to put in the effort to make it work", "Not picking a side or saying \"YTA\" here but you did say earlier that his parents are putting down $150k and the most you could put down is 30... which is a huge discrepancy. It sounds like your relationship is fairly rocky to begin with and maybe he/his parents recognize that. If I was giving my son $150k to buy a house with his wife/gf who couldn't hardly put up a fifth of what I am I'd probably be cautioning my child as well. I mean if the marriage falls apart are you going to want an equal share of the house in the divorce?", "Rightfully so.  You aren\u2019t married or even engaged.  Mingling finances in a major joint asset is stupid.", "Oh, honey, why do you believe this?", "Are you Chinese yourself? There\u2019s often a culture gap between American born Chinese and immigrant Chinese. Your description of your bf\u2019s family leads me to think that there isn\u2019t much western influence in the way he was raised. If you\u2019re invested in the house hunting process, and your bf can\u2019t translate, it might be worth it to bring your own translator. This is a lot of money you\u2019re plunking down and you have the right to know what is going on. \n\nHave you guys done pre marriage counselling to explicitly spell out your values and plans for the future? Is the way he\u2019s been house hunting indicative of the way he treats you in this relationship? The way he approaches problems is not going to drastically change once he marries. Taking someone else\u2019s feelings and thoughts into consideration is such a basic relationship skill. If he can\u2019t show he\u2019s a good life partner to you, don\u2019t tie your life to him.

Houses are selling for more than they should, especially in FL. Taxes on homes have also skyrocketed. When the housing bubble came to a massive crash in 2008, many people couldn't even sell their homes bc of the huge drops in value. If this happens again, the house would not be an asset. He would be left with the debt while you could walk away. If he couldn't maintain the house, then it would reflect poorly on his credit, but not yours. There would only be a benefit to refinancing later. So that argument is super weak, on his behalf.\n\nAlso, if he needs your income to help pay, how will he qualify for the loan without you on it? Will he make all financial decisions without your input?\n\nIf you truly love him, then no one will be able to talk you out of marrying him. But protect yourself and your dog!

It sounds to me that he is a chauvinist and a woman\u2019s opinion doesn\u2019t count. He is milking you for your 30K", "If his parents are putting in $150K, why does he need you in order to buy the house?  \n\n\nI'm guessing that he doesn't make enough money to qualify for the mortgage, and will be using you to get \"combined income\" that gets over that.  \n\n\nSign nothing the bank hands out - assuming you stay in this relationship, which imo would be a bad move.", "The most you are entitled to is 17% based on your contribution. 50/50 is a ridiculous expectation as is 40/60.  You essentially could break up a week in and walk away with his parent\u2019s money.  Hard no.  They\u2019d be idiots to agree to that.    And given you aren\u2019t in a stable relationship they are smart in refusing to make you a party to this at all.  You guys should be breaking up, not investing I real estate together.", "So you dont want to use the 150k his parents are contributing?", "She\u2019s not going to help pay the mortgage, unless I\u2019ve missed something she added in a comment or edit. She is expressly told she will not be on the mortgage but is expected to pay for utilities and taxes because boyfriend wants the benefit of her money but gives her none of the respect of choosing the home, applying for the mortgage and investing her money in the down payment. How does her name on the deed mean anything if she is treated as a paying guest in the home? How does her name on the deed help her when boyfriend can\u2019t pay the mortgage and the home gets foreclosed? Her name on the deed as a stand-alone does not give her what she is wanting out of the relationship or the home. It\u2019s not the problem here.", "And IMO, she would be crazy to do that. It won\u2019t get better.", "The wife could legally say they've contributed to the costs of the house if its for property taxes. Negating this being a pre-marital asset for the BF. Same goes for decorating.", "He qualifies for the loan alone, but he will be house poor. He won\u2019t be able to afford anything but the mortgage", "Her name on the deed literally means the difference between it being HER asset or not her asset. I case you\u2019re unaware, typically (although not always) a person\u2019s mortgage payment is a combination of the following: Principal repayment, monthly interest, school and property taxes, and homeowner\u2019s insurance (at least for the first year). So if the bank says your mortgage payment is $3200/month, $1000 of that is probably taxes. \n\nIf she\u2019s paying the taxes, she is unequivocally helping to pay the mortgage. He\u2019s just to phrase it as her paying taxes and not paying any of the mortgage principal so that the house remains 100% his asset. \n\nTo pay a large chunk of her boyfriends monthly housing expenses while not having a piece of paper that says the house is partially hers would be a really bad plan.", "Ha, really? If that's the case, it sounds like that'd actually be a good thing for her to put money to the property tax.", "Is that true in Florida? It's not true in a number of other states.", "NAH. You want different things. \n\nYou want to buy a house with your husband and make decisions together, work on home projects together. \n\nHe wants a tenant who will pay whatever rent he decides on and live in whatever house he chooses, but has no ownership or say otherwise. \n\nIt sounds like his mind is already made up. You have options. \n1) Walk away from this relationship because you\u2019re never going to get the type of equal partnership you want with your boyfriend. \n2) Accept to live in your boyfriend\u2019s home and pay him rent while having no real say in the home. \n\nI don\u2019t think #2 is what you really want but if you decide you love him enough to accept #2, make sure\n* the amount of rent you are paying your boyfriend/month is not much more than you could afford living on your own. The house expenses only come into play if the rent your being asked to pay is under market rate. It makes zero sense to ever pay rent above the market rate. \n\n* Never pay for anything in the home you can\u2019t take with you. Don\u2019t pay for a dishwasher, don\u2019t pay to replace the ceiling fans, don\u2019t pay to repaint your bedroom.  \n\n* Never pay for repairs. Repairs are on the owner, not the tenant. Don\u2019t pay for maintenance - replacing the filter, mowing the lawn, these are responsibilities of the owner, not the tenant. \n\n* keep track of everything you pay for so that if your relationship ends, you take all the items you paid for with you. \n\n* Don\u2019t give away your labor. Say the house needs deep cleaning\u2026not your job, lawn needs mowing, flowers need weeding\u2026not your job, outside of the house needs to be repainted\u2026.not your job. These things improve the value of the home. You don\u2019t own home, so don\u2019t \u201cspend\u201d your labor improving someone else\u2019s asset. \n\nIf your boyfriend ever tries to get you to pay for any of the above, there better be a legal document that if your relationship ends, X amount is due back to you and you need to find a lawyer yo represent your interest to draw up this document.", "The best solution is then for you to pay rent to him, not put the money towards the downpayment. That way he can keep ownership and you can keep your money for whenever you can own something.", "Too sensible.. they\u2019re gonna call you an Ah now"]}
