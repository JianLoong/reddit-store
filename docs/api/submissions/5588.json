He has been drunk both times.\n\nThe first time was for my mom's birthday. We recently moved and our dogs have had a difficult time adjusting - developed separation anxiety but we didn't know this at the time.\n\nMy mom's party was held about 20 minutes away and pretty much as soon as we got there, we were called by our neighbour as our dogs were going absolutely bonkers. By the time we were called, Danny was absolutely drunk (it was a Saturday and he started drinking at home) so my sister's boyfriend (*Eddie) came with us to see what the problem was. Eddie came into the house with me to sort them out while Danny stayed in the car. Later, Danny screamed and screamed at me about how disrespectful this was and how dare I treat him as the man of the house like this, that I went inside my house with another man while he sat outside like an asshole, what kind of man goes inside a house with someone else's wife, etc. The next morning he didn't even apologize and just tried to act like nothing happened. We moved on.\n\nThen last night we had a BBQ with my family for Christmas at our home. Danny and Eddie cooked the meat. Danny took the meat inside once done and then went back outside I think. I was floating around the house trying to be a good host to my family. During this time Eddie took it upon himself to cut up some of the steaks that were cooked (they were massive cuts). When Danny discovered this he started throwing a silent tantrum and didn't eat. When my family left he started a huge fight with me about how I let this happen, that Eddie had no right to cut the meat, that I disrespected Danny and didn't have his back by eating the food. I slighted him by eating the food regardless and this is now the second time I have seriously disrespected him. That he still holds the previous incident against me, that he obviously isn't man enough for me, that he isn't a good enough provider obviously, I'm a b\u00a3tch because I let happen, etc. He again was extremely drunk. I must watch if this happens again, this is the second strike, etc. Really going on about it, full on screaming at me that I don't get it. He gave all the steak to the dogs and ate the chicken \"because I didn't need any help cooking that\". Compared me to his narcissistic mother. Saying I clearly have no regard for his feelings. Told me to f\u00a3ck off.\n\nHe never brings up these issues with Eddie, and frankly considering Danny had a two YEAR long affair during the course of our relationship, I don't think he's in any position to talk about disrespect.\n\nI don't think I've done anything wrong, but AITA for I don't even know what?", "created_utc": 1671948093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuryx1/aita_for_supposedly_disrespecting_my_husband/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had a partner who would do very similar things and I would often find myself attempting to make amends for the most absurd things (e.g, leaving the bar before him, going on vacation to visit a friend). I\u2019d definitely seek a counselor to help you figure it out. And if you\u2019re not already, if you have loved ones you would trust, confide in them about what\u2019s been happening recently.

What about the next 20 years?  A great relationship isn't \"mostly good\", it's virtually all good.  I've been happily married 28 years.  We've had our disagreements and aren't always happy with each other, but we don't fight, we just don't.  We're best friends, why would we ever fight and be intentionally mean to each other?  It just doesn't happen.  That's how it's supposed to be.  When we get mad, we walk away and cool off, then talk again.

You shouldn\u2019t try justifying that behavior, especially when he\u2019s exhibiting narcissistic traits like his mother - this will most likely continue for years ahead and may even pass on to any children you may have with him (please god no)", "He's probably cheating on her again now which explains his over the top reaction.", "I do have a job.
