She insisted we needed to adhere to a strict budget, I said we should get whatever the kids need/were drawn to. She hopped out of the car and walked home. I went shopping for 7 hours.", "selftext": "I am the breadwinner for our family and my wife stays at home. She is a few years older than me and I have always struggled with feeling like I report to her. She denies it strongly, but I still feel that there is a power imbalance that she benefits from (even after 15 years of marriage). We've done well over the years and have a net worth of $2m+. I have a great job and we make $300k+/yr. My wife is very frugal and not only doesn't like spending money herself, but shames/pressures me when I do. She grew up in a poor family and spending doesn't come easy for her. Not the worst problem to have in a spouse, I know! But hear me out.\n\nWe were heading to a large local mall with all of our kids to do school shopping when the topic of a budget came up. She was insisting that the budget for each kid should be $100. I suggested that we should be more flexible and get what the kids need + what the kids might want/be excited by. \"Why am I working as hard as I do if I can't spend the money on my kids from time to time?\"\n\nWe do not spoil our kids and back-to-school is pretty much the only time we get new stuff for our kids. She then changed tactics and claimed that it was her that does laundry and the kids already have enough clothes, so I would have to do the additional laundry that would inevitably come with more clothes. I dug in and said that since I am the breadwinner, and make all of the money, I should have the right to spend it on my kids how I see fit. I have never once in our entire marriage tried to control or restrict how she spends money, but she does it to me all the time. She snapped and said \"fine, you can just go with the kids then and spend to your heart's content. I don't want to have anything to do with it.\" and got out of the car at the next stop sign.\n\nI begged her to get back in. I turned around the car and gave her several opportunities to get back in and I offered to give her a ride. She refused and literally walked 6 miles back home alone. I was quite shocked that she would do that but proceeded to the mall where I spent seven hours shopping with the kids getting lots of great stuff for school. I definitely didn't go overboard and spend like I was a celebrity, but we focused on getting what the kids needed with a healthy amount of things they wanted as well. AITA for digging in and insisting on spending however much was needed on my kids?\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all of the comments and perspectives so far. One theme that keeps recurring is how we had this discussion in front of our kids. It is true that they saw the result of the argument and my wife getting out of the vehicle, but we have a large passenger van, the AC was blasting, and they were mostly in the back and it is unlikely that they heard much of the conversation.

At some point my mom passed away suddenly after a short period of illness, and my dad ended up all alone (I'm an adult living in a different country). He's now going on more frequent vacations and renovating the house and stuff, because he's thoroughly regretting not spending more of the money he made over the years on doing fun stuff together as a couple.

Tackling it by yourself may only make it worse as she feels like she's losing control, but frame it as \"you deserve everything I've given them and more\" or something like that, really emphasize that it's okay to do these things now. nothing bad is likely to happen and if it does, you can either fall back on savings or make a savings agreement or something so she has something to feel more secure in while exploring a new comfort zone.\n\nJust thoughts, I hope I'm not too off-base.", "Is she pregnant?", "NTA.. but your wife has a dep rooted money issue she should work on", "NTA. But I can say from experience, growing up poor can be a breeding ground for all sorts of trauma. Even if you are in a loving supportive family environment. As you mentioned, it's obviously ingrained within her to be very careful with spending money. Some people mentioned her being controlling and that may just be how her trauma has manifested. (Hard to say because we don't know you personally as a couple.) This is obviously going to be an on-going issue that you should both probably work on. I suggest sitting down and having a talk with her and say you just want to understand more where she's coming from and see how you can move forward together and compromise. (I know that may seem weird to you because it seems from what you wrote you've been kind of following her lead. But wording it like that may help get the point across that you're trying to solve the issue WITH her and may help keep the talks peaceful for everyone.) Ask her what her exact concerns are about the amount you spent aside from having more clothes to wash. Maybe deeper fears or issues will make themselves known. If she's worried about the kids being spoiled and/or laundry maybe suggest a very simple shore list (not sure if they are doing chores now at all). They can schedule a time to help with laundry or other things. You can frame it as teaching them to appreciate and take care of their things and show they value both of you as parents for the items they receive AND everything the mom (or both of you-not sure how you divide household work) does around the house for them. Get this settled now and set up a plan moving forward because as the kids get older it's going to get worse when things like first cars, school activities, outings with friends, and higher education expenses come up.

They actually lasted pretty well.", "It\u2019s more of a tradition. My kids always had lots of clothes but we still went/go back to school shopping. It\u2019s a whole day out where they\u2019d pick out school supplies, clothes, and shoes. We\u2019d do lunch too. It\u2019s pretty fun. I have fond memories of shopping with my mom. Usually it would be a family thing with aunts and cousins around my age. We\u2019re in our 50s now and still reminisce about the fun times.", "Yeah. In high school. We were friends with a family that had alternating years of kids. So their eldest would get the text book, then me, then their middle child, then my younger sister, then their youngest. \n\nI never thought it was weird that we had to buy textbooks. But it was mainly maths and science subjects from memory.", "Conservatively, I'd say $100 USD can get 2 pairs of jeans, a tee shirt, and a hoodie if you shop the right sales in a lower end store. I'd say $300 at a minimum on each of 2 shopping trips (fall and spring). \n\nMy kids are older, so I split shopping with them. I will buy regular clothes, but if they really want that $75 hoodie, they have to buy it. One family member would give her kids $200 (over 10 years ago) to spend how they wanted. Either 2 designer pairs of jeans and a shirt or 2, or a much bigger wardrobe. Their choice.", "Yes you need new shoes blazer pe kit because children grow alot. I agree they could keep a calculator for a few years depends on the kid and how clumsy they are.", "I mean, she currently has a closet full of clothes that she doesn\u2019t want to get rid of, so she crams them into every nook and cranny. Since she buys her own clothes with her allowance and does her own laundry, her parents only rule is that she has to make sure she keeps her space tidy.\n\nIdk if she has enough clothes for natural consequences to set in yet.\n\nEdit to add: Great question!", "Not really. If they\u2019re growing that means trying stuff on. If their all different ages and genders that can mean a different shop for each of them unless you insist on goodwill/Walmart/target.", "I giess?", "This made me laugh out loud, I absolutely understand putting an AirTag on it. My mother would have had apoplexy if I lost that blazer, and I bet it happens -all the time-  because kids are kids and everyone\u2019s got the same blazer. Props for the forward thinking!", "One of my sons winter uniforms ( blazer, jumper, school button down, slacks, scarf ) $1550 AUD I had to get 3 and have them all monogrammed on top. So thankfully for the school Facebook group to sell on uniforms on the cheap.", "Oh, my! \ud83d\ude2c I send my kid to school in printed tshirts/hoodies & jeans. (He's at university.) It sounds expensive to dress for school in Australia. Ouch.", "For some reason this made me giggle.\n\nNever thought about that before but I would definitely do the same.", "Depends on the school. Pretty sure a lot of them do that, but mine was a specific blazer from a specific shop, and it wasn\u2019t even a private school, just a comp in a nice suburb.", "If I was a boy and it was really hot outside? Skirts it is!", "That is horrible, dress codes are so sexist towards men too and that is one way it harms them", "I just had a flashback to grade school when I went to a private Catholic school lol I forgot about going to the uniform store until just now (early '90s). memory unlocked lol", "Well that\u2019s at least something. \n\nI will never understand uniforms. Everywhere my or my kids had uniforms they were in theory only because literally nobody wore them.", "Every year I would spend two weeks with my grandparents (one week with each set) and they would take me back to school shopping for clothes and shoes. My mom was a teacher so she would send me down about 3 weeks before school started. When I could drive I would still see my grandparent and go shopping with them, but then I would drive them around and take them to the movies.  I loved this time with them!! The amount of money they spent was way more than $100.  And I spent more than that on my daughter every year. This crap is expensive.", "And \u201chit the end of season sales and guess what size bathing suit and summer clothes you\u2019ll need next year\u201d.", "but wouldn't you have been gradually getting him new clothes throughout the year? If the old clothes don't fit why has he been wearing them until school starting time", "You'd think so.... but no, kids will always find a way to be mean ...", "I wore a kilt, stockings, buttoned shirt, tie, and a scratchy wool jersey. And that wasn't that long ago... Oh wait... I graduated High School 16 years ago...\n\nOh no.", "I feel like we went to the same school. That phrase is embedded into my brain and I only did French for 2 years!", "There\u2019s usually one local news story a year of lads doing exactly this.", "The chemical smell in those uniform places was strong!", "american school is awful \ud83e\udd72 you don't roll up bright and shiny the first weeks and it blows your entire shot for the year.", "I graduated 9 years ago and the time is flying by, my guy. Cheers to still being around to feel old."]}
