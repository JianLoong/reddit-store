She insisted we needed to adhere to a strict budget, I said we should get whatever the kids need/were drawn to. She hopped out of the car and walked home. I went shopping for 7 hours.", "selftext": "I am the breadwinner for our family and my wife stays at home. She is a few years older than me and I have always struggled with feeling like I report to her. She denies it strongly, but I still feel that there is a power imbalance that she benefits from (even after 15 years of marriage). We've done well over the years and have a net worth of $2m+. I have a great job and we make $300k+/yr. My wife is very frugal and not only doesn't like spending money herself, but shames/pressures me when I do. She grew up in a poor family and spending doesn't come easy for her. Not the worst problem to have in a spouse, I know! But hear me out.\n\nWe were heading to a large local mall with all of our kids to do school shopping when the topic of a budget came up. She was insisting that the budget for each kid should be $100. I suggested that we should be more flexible and get what the kids need + what the kids might want/be excited by. \"Why am I working as hard as I do if I can't spend the money on my kids from time to time?\"\n\nWe do not spoil our kids and back-to-school is pretty much the only time we get new stuff for our kids. She then changed tactics and claimed that it was her that does laundry and the kids already have enough clothes, so I would have to do the additional laundry that would inevitably come with more clothes. I dug in and said that since I am the breadwinner, and make all of the money, I should have the right to spend it on my kids how I see fit. I have never once in our entire marriage tried to control or restrict how she spends money, but she does it to me all the time. She snapped and said \"fine, you can just go with the kids then and spend to your heart's content. I don't want to have anything to do with it.\" and got out of the car at the next stop sign.\n\nI begged her to get back in. I turned around the car and gave her several opportunities to get back in and I offered to give her a ride. She refused and literally walked 6 miles back home alone. I was quite shocked that she would do that but proceeded to the mall where I spent seven hours shopping with the kids getting lots of great stuff for school. I definitely didn't go overboard and spend like I was a celebrity, but we focused on getting what the kids needed with a healthy amount of things they wanted as well. AITA for digging in and insisting on spending however much was needed on my kids?\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all of the comments and perspectives so far. One theme that keeps recurring is how we had this discussion in front of our kids. It is true that they saw the result of the argument and my wife getting out of the vehicle, but we have a large passenger van, the AC was blasting, and they were mostly in the back and it is unlikely that they heard much of the conversation.

At some point my mom passed away suddenly after a short period of illness, and my dad ended up all alone (I'm an adult living in a different country). He's now going on more frequent vacations and renovating the house and stuff, because he's thoroughly regretting not spending more of the money he made over the years on doing fun stuff together as a couple. Now he doesn't enjoy all this neatly as much. There's nothing to be done about it and it's a shame.

Dang, had no idea that was still a thing. Don\u2019t really have much to add, just fun to learn something.", "I got a good chuckle out of this.", "Did anyone else's mum buy them a blazer about 5 sizes too big and then just let the sleeves down every year until the final year of school?", "the blazer is not a yearly back to school cost though. Most people buy them in year 7, to big so that they last", "Aldi are doing a full uniform for \u00a35 and most supermarkets aren't much more. Blazers are obviously more but that's not a once a year thing", "Australian uniforms can be quite pricey though!\n\nThe thing is that American kids just buy regular clothes, which you'd need anyway. There's certainly cheap options but some items like shoes and backpacks just aren't so cheap... and at $300K a year it's mean to expect kids to have the cheapest of everything. \n\nYou can get T-shirts for under $10 certainly but especially if your kid is a teenager and in adult sizes you are not buying trousers for that. $100 for every outfit, though, nah. \n\nAm I going to spend $1000 on my 11th grader? Haha no. But I wouldn't get away with $100 either. Plus there's school supplies (paper and pens and such). I was lucky and school provided that for elementary but not for secondary. (At least we're not french. I've seen their lists. It's got to be at least 200\u20ac a kid for stationery.)", "Wow 2 a year, I had to make 1 last 3 years", ">I normally got 2 blazers each year\n\nMost people got 2 for the 5 years of wearing it. One in year 7 and one in year 9 or 10 depending on how quick they grow", "That's a lot, school books don't need to be bought here still and 30 for a school shirt seems a lot", "It's not that they're separate 'school clothes'. It's that there's this sort of expectation in certain circles that you basically start the school year with a whole new wardrobe, or most of one. Obviously that is going to depend on your financial circumstances, but I'd say middle class and up would probably see it that way, perhaps just to slightly varying degrees. And there will probably be social consequences from the other kids if you're still wearing last year's coat, shoes, etc. \n\nI'm not defending or agreeing with it, I'm just saying that's often the expectation.", "When I was young back to school shopping was really the only time you got new clothes for the year, and even then (over 30 year ago), $100 might not have been enough, depending on if you needed to replace your winter coat/ shoes.", "It's not that they're separate 'school clothes'.

God forbid a child be comfortable at school apparently \ud83d\ude43", "My son's school is very strict with the school blazer and wont let them take it off even on hot summer days. \n\nMost UK schools are really strict with correct uniform. \n\nWe'll see a news article most years about some school teachers carrying out a 'skirt length inspection' on the girls. Some boys will wear skirts to school in support of the girls.", "That doesn't include foot wear, it's only shirt and trousers and that's the price for primary school not secondary", "How did you not outgrow them", "Last school book list for my eldest would have cost closer to 200Aud if I hadn't been able to reuse supplies from previous years (only needed to buy half of his stuff). Polo shirts are 30Aud and school jacket is 55Aud, they charge 20 for pants but I can get them cheaper at Kmart amd Best and Less. Shoes my boys normally go through 2-4 pairs a year whether I buy cheap or expensive ones because my kids are active.\n\nOh and then we have the resource scheme for text books and other supplies usually around 50-100 depending on the grade (book list is mainly stationery and notebooks)\n\nAnd my kids attend a state public school", "obviously it's a different culture so I'm just going to have to defer to your expertise.\n\nBut I also remember being that age and wearing clothes that wear 2 years old if the still fit and were in good conditions, in rotation with my newer clothes. And never thinking twice because they were obviously clothes I liked that's why they were bought. I can't imaging even noticing if someone elses clothes were from a previous year rather than a few months ago at that age, the same as as an adult.\n\nI guess what I am saying is I'm glad I didn't have to experience american school", "Same here!

Seems terribly annoying, though I imagine it helps avoid the problem of richer kids making fun of other kids for their clothes and such.", "A lot of parents buy them a few sizes too big so that kids grow into them. I've seen some Year 7s that look like they're drowning in their blazers lol", "Worth noting that 30aud is about 20usd and about 16gbp", "This was literally me, my mum said it had to last me year 7-9 (11-14/15) before she'd get me a new one so it was absolutely enormous \ud83d\ude2d"]}
