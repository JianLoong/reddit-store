She insisted we needed to adhere to a strict budget, I said we should get whatever the kids need/were drawn to. She hopped out of the car and walked home. I went shopping for 7 hours.", "selftext": "I am the breadwinner for our family and my wife stays at home. She is a few years older than me and I have always struggled with feeling like I report to her. She denies it strongly, but I still feel that there is a power imbalance that she benefits from (even after 15 years of marriage). We've done well over the years and have a net worth of $2m+. I have a great job and we make $300k+/yr. My wife is very frugal and not only doesn't like spending money herself, but shames/pressures me when I do. She grew up in a poor family and spending doesn't come easy for her. Not the worst problem to have in a spouse, I know! But hear me out.\n\nWe were heading to a large local mall with all of our kids to do school shopping when the topic of a budget came up. She was insisting that the budget for each kid should be $100. I suggested that we should be more flexible and get what the kids need + what the kids might want/be excited by. \"Why am I working as hard as I do if I can't spend the money on my kids from time to time?\"\n\nWe do not spoil our kids and back-to-school is pretty much the only time we get new stuff for our kids. She then changed tactics and claimed that it was her that does laundry and the kids already have enough clothes, so I would have to do the additional laundry that would inevitably come with more clothes. I dug in and said that since I am the breadwinner, and make all of the money, I should have the right to spend it on my kids how I see fit. I have never once in our entire marriage tried to control or restrict how she spends money, but she does it to me all the time. She snapped and said \"fine, you can just go with the kids then and spend to your heart's content. I don't want to have anything to do with it.\" and got out of the car at the next stop sign.\n\nI begged her to get back in. I turned around the car and gave her several opportunities to get back in and I offered to give her a ride. She refused and literally walked 6 miles back home alone. I was quite shocked that she would do that but proceeded to the mall where I spent seven hours shopping with the kids getting lots of great stuff for school. I definitely didn't go overboard and spend like I was a celebrity, but we focused on getting what the kids needed with a healthy amount of things they wanted as well. AITA for digging in and insisting on spending however much was needed on my kids?\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all of the comments and perspectives so far. One theme that keeps recurring is how we had this discussion in front of our kids. It is true that they saw the result of the argument and my wife getting out of the vehicle, but we have a large passenger van, the AC was blasting, and they were mostly in the back and it is unlikely that they heard much of the conversation.

At some point my mom passed away suddenly after a short period of illness, and my dad ended up all alone (I'm an adult living in a different country). He's now going on more frequent vacations and renovating the house and stuff, because he's thoroughly regretting not spending more of the money he made over the years on doing fun stuff together as a couple. Now he doesn't enjoy all this neatly as much. There's nothing to be done about it and it's a shame.

Tackling it by yourself may only make it worse as she feels like she's losing control, but frame it as \"you deserve everything I've given them and more\" or something like that, really emphasize that it's okay to do these things now. nothing bad is likely to happen and if it does, you can either fall back on savings or make a savings agreement or something so she has something to feel more secure in while exploring a new comfort zone.\n\nJust thoughts, I hope I'm not too off-base.", "Is she pregnant?", "NTA.. but your wife has a dep rooted money issue she should work on", "NTA. But I can say from experience, growing up poor can be a breeding ground for all sorts of trauma. Even if you are in a loving supportive family environment. As you mentioned, it's obviously ingrained within her to be very careful with spending money. Some people mentioned her being controlling and that may just be how her trauma has manifested. (Hard to say because we don't know you personally as a couple.) This is obviously going to be an on-going issue that you should both probably work on. I suggest sitting down and having a talk with her and say you just want to understand more where she's coming from and see how you can move forward together and compromise. (I know that may seem weird to you because it seems from what you wrote you've been kind of following her lead. But wording it like that may help get the point across that you're trying to solve the issue WITH her and may help keep the talks peaceful for everyone.) Ask her what her exact concerns are about the amount you spent aside from having more clothes to wash. Maybe deeper fears or issues will make themselves known. If she's worried about the kids being spoiled and/or laundry maybe suggest a very simple shore list (not sure if they are doing chores now at all). They can schedule a time to help with laundry or other things. You can frame it as teaching them to appreciate and take care of their things and show they value both of you as parents for the items they receive AND everything the mom (or both of you-not sure how you divide household work) does around the house for them. Get this settled now and set up a plan moving forward because as the kids get older it's going to get worse when things like first cars, school activities, outings with friends, and higher education expenses come up.

Why? Because my Mom is spineless and my Dad took advantage of that. Back then things were a lot different for reasons but I want to say that he is a really good man and now he\u2019s a great husband and father and grandfather now. The best. However, because of this power dynamic that I grew up with, I inevitably became the very thing I never wanted to be. Spineless like my mother. I have very little self respect as a result and more importantly I\u2019ve been in very abusive relationships. It\u2019s not like you are yelling at each other in front of the kids and making them listen to it. You stood up for yourself. Good for you. I really wish I had of seen my Mom do the same during all those years she was powerless because she felt powerless.

Lucky kids!\" The only school shopping I ever did was notebooks and pencils when the last ones ran out.\n\nIt's all perspective. Maybe OP's wife grew up poor too and hasn't learned how to let a little loose since then? Or maybe she's a tightwad.

Each of the parents seems to think \"I have a right to make the rules unilaterally because I _____.\"\n\nA budget is a good idea and using one with the kids would help teach them how to manage money. However, you don't just pick an arbitrary amount as the limit. Did your wife even have a clue about how much the essentials cost? You and your wife could have taken the kids' back-to-school lists, looked up base prices online, and given each kid a budget based on that with some room to splurge on a couple of things. You could have also bought the bare essentials yourselves and let the kids each have a budget to buy extras. There are a few constructive ways you could have handled this. Instead, you turned this into a pissing contest in front of your kids.\n\nLearn a lesson: Budgets should be worked out before you head to the store, not in the car arguing in front of the kids.\n\nIf you feel there is an imbalance in your marriage, that is something to work on separately.", "You need two outfits for school in the UK (one to wear, one in the wash, a few extra shirts).\n\nIn the US, you wear something different every day and it can get very difficult as a teen if you don't wear the \"right\" clothes. \n\n(I am Brit who went to school in the US)", "Not even essentials, but just in general!
