He has never really been good with money and shortly after we moved in together he got us in debt by not paying the bills and maxing his credit cards out (\u00a32000). All the bills were in his name and I just sent him money each month as we split the bills 50/50. Turned out he wasn\u2019t using the money for bills he was using it on dinners out, treating me and holidays. I found out when a debt letter was sent to the house in his name and I accidentally opened it.\nI asked him and he lied about it and when I showed him the proof he confessed and said he was sorry and his intentions were good. His mum bailed us out and we got back on track and I put the bills in all my name so I know they get paid.\nThen a few years later after marriage and our first child it happened again with his credit cards and it was about \u00a34000 and he\u2019s not made any effort to pay it off and tanked his credit which affected us as we were trying to get a mortgage. \nWe had a massive argument and he begged and pleaded for another chance for our family and he was sorry and wanted to correct it. We put a plan in place and he paid them off and cancelled the cards and since then all has been fine. \nWe\u2019ve recently had another baby 9 months ago and even though I\u2019m on maternity I still pay 50/50 of the bills. We are due to remortgage in April so I wanted to get a jump on things with what paper work we will need, making sure our credit is okay and see if we can save up a little more for then. \nI look at our credit scores and his is worse than before and it turns out he got new credit cards out and maxed them out around \u00a35500 altogether. I confronted him again and yet again he lied and when I showed him proof he was like a deer in headlights. \nAt first I gave him an ultimatum saying he has by new year to pay them off and build his credit otherwise I walk and for now he can sleep in the spare room as he has broken my trust but I don\u2019t want our kids to notice so he goes bed after our kids are asleep. A week went by and I tried to put on a brave face for my kids but today I just broke down, I feel completely and utterly broken, I have no trust left, no emotions I feel like a shell. I lost it on him and told him how much he has hurt me and how shattered he has made me. I asked him to leave and go his mothers. He started to cry (he never cries) and afterwards my little girl started asking where he was so I did a movie night for us and left her sleep in my bed. \nNow I am sitting here feeling awful wondering if I\u2019m the asshole by making him leave. \nI know everyone will tell me to run and he won\u2019t change but I love him and he\u2019s an amazing dad. But I also have this voice that keeps saying I\u2019m a doormat and he won\u2019t change.

That's, well, after the third time he needs professional help to change and even that isn't a guarantee.\n\nYou can love him, but trusting him financially is just enabling him and hobbling yourself.

But definitely don\u2019t think it actually will change, he\u2019s just too irresponsible", "NTA.  He is a liar, he doesn\u2019t respect you, your child or your marriage, and you are doing the right thing.  He has made your life unstable and not secure.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a man whose \u201cnot so good with money.\u201d This is a man whose literally putting his own frivolous wants above his families needs. My husband grew up with a father like this. His mother kept giving him chances. Want to know what her final straw was before she left him? She found out he took out a bunch of loans in her name, opened a bunch of credit cards in her name, never paid the debt, and they had to file bankruptcy. His mother moved into a motel room after that and his father couch surfed on random people\u2019s couches (he\u2019s 64 and still couch surfing). My husband became homeless at 17 because of this. I hope this shows you what you are risking by staying with him. Every time you forgive him, he\u2019s going to up the anti the next time until you\u2019re left with nothing.", "This will never, ever, ever end. NTA for divorcing him. And don't expect that he will pay any child fees. He will be totally in debt.", "NTA - Does your husband have ADHD or another possible diagnosis that would help explain the terrible money management habits? Is he blowing money on some sort of addiction you may not be seeing?", "NTA\n\nHe can still be an amazing dad while he lives in another house. People may disagree with me, but I think this is just as bad as infidelity. You must feel so utterly betrayed. There is nothing worse than not being able to trust the stability of the foundations in your life. \n\nHe robbed you of that three times. \n\nIt is not your job to control him and his spending. That sounds so fucking exhausting. \n\nStay strong. You\u2019ve done the right thing.", "NTA\u2026. You have every right to be upset, and maybe this is the wake-up call he needs. I\u2019m glad that little \u201cdon\u2019t be a doormat\u201d voice is inside of you, because you need to be tough. Don\u2019t give up on everything yet though.\n\nThere are resources out there to get help for him, and to rebuild your trust together. He has to make the decision himself to get the help. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s definitely going to work, and you both might have to go through heartache and learn a lot of ugly things, but worse marriages than this have turned around. If you do get through it, you\u2019ll have a deeper, open, vulnerable relationship. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll know that you can handle anything.", "Thankyou. I\u2019ve never kicked him out before so I think this shocked him. \nI just want to do right by my kids and I never thought I\u2019d ever be in a position like this.", "Thankyou. I have always said to my husband no matter what happens we can get through anything including the mistakes made however I hate lying as what does that set for our children. \nI\u2019ve booked in with a therapist already but they couldn\u2019t see me till next week.", "Thankyou, never thought of it like that. I do believe he needs professional help. We both grew up very differently where if I couldn\u2019t afford it I didn\u2019t get and to save as you never know what\u2019s round the corner however my husband was babied and his mum and Nan just treated him all the time and bailed him out and even now try and do it with the kids where everytime we go round they have presents for my little one. They are not rich people but love comfortably and the presents a little things such a LOL dolls and magazines but I don\u2019t want my little ones to expect they get a present over spending time with them as they sue the excuse \u201cwell we don\u2019t see them often\u201d", "I know, if this happened to my friend I\u2019d be telling her to leave and nothing will change yet I fell bad for even thinking of leaving, I worry about the kids.", "I\u2019ve sat down and gone through his bank statements and it\u2019s usually stupid stuff like takeaways, nips to the shops and gets bits and bobs. Just loads of little payments for stuff but nothing substantial. We have a joint bank for bills so I make sure the bills are paid for but after that my money is mine and his money is his but I\u2019m not sure why he is using credit cards again. \nHe gets paid more than me but seems like he can\u2019t manage his money well.", "Thankyou. It sounds silly but other than this he is a good person and a good dad but I have lost all trust for him. \n\nI feel so deflated and depleted. I\u2019m just so tired and I want to endure my children have the best In life. \nI so sick of putting a front up infront of everyone. Making out I\u2019m fine and the one trying to fix everyone\u2019s problems in life. But by doing this I\u2019m ending up torturing myself and it\u2019s insanity", "Hopefully this shocks him to the point of making sincere changes!", "Whatever you think he is spending money on is probably not the entire story.  He needs to account for everything he spends if you all want this to work, and I mean everything. I am still leaning towards some form of attention disorder issue and/or something he is spending money on that he does not want you to know about.", "That\u2019s my worry, I can\u2019t fully know what he spends his money on but I feel I shouldn\u2019t have to baby him. His mother did that with his father and I just can\u2019t do that.", "You COULD fully know if he wanted to be fully transparent, but he does not and there has to be something he does not want you to see.  You should probably start whatever the legal separation procedure is in your country because he does not want to change."]}
