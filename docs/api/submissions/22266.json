I confronted him again and yet again he lied and when I showed him proof he was like a deer in headlights. \nAt first I gave him an ultimatum saying he has by new year to pay them off and build his credit otherwise I walk and for now he can sleep in the spare room as he has broken my trust but I don\u2019t want our kids to notice so he goes bed after our kids are asleep. A week went by and I tried to put on a brave face for my kids but today I just broke down, I feel completely and utterly broken, I have no trust left, no emotions I feel like a shell. I lost it on him and told him how much he has hurt me and how shattered he has made me. I asked him to leave and go his mothers. He started to cry (he never cries) and afterwards my little girl started asking where he was so I did a movie night for us and left her sleep in my bed. \nNow I am sitting here feeling awful wondering if I\u2019m the asshole by making him leave. \nI know everyone will tell me to run and he won\u2019t change but I love him and he\u2019s an amazing dad.

This isn\u2019t a man whose \u201cnot so good with money.\u201d This is a man whose literally putting his own frivolous wants above his families needs. My husband grew up with a father like this. His mother kept giving him chances. Want to know what her final straw was before she left him? She found out he took out a bunch of loans in her name, opened a bunch of credit cards in her name, never paid the debt, and they had to file bankruptcy. His mother moved into a motel room after that and his father couch surfed on random people\u2019s couches (he\u2019s 64 and still couch surfing). My husband became homeless at 17 because of this. I hope this shows you what you are risking by staying with him.

I\u2019ve never kicked him out before so I think this shocked him. \nI just want to do right by my kids and I never thought I\u2019d ever be in a position like this.", "Thankyou. I have always said to my husband no matter what happens we can get through anything including the mistakes made however I hate lying as what does that set for our children. \nI\u2019ve booked in with a therapist already but they couldn\u2019t see me till next week.", "Thankyou, never thought of it like that.

They are not rich people but love comfortably and the presents a little things such a LOL dolls and magazines but I don\u2019t want my little ones to expect they get a present over spending time with them as they sue the excuse \u201cwell we don\u2019t see them often\u201d", "I know, if this happened to my friend I\u2019d be telling her to leave and nothing will change yet I fell bad for even thinking of leaving, I worry about the kids.", "I\u2019ve sat down and gone through his bank statements and it\u2019s usually stupid stuff like takeaways, nips to the shops and gets bits and bobs.

Third, all his money deposits to the joint account, forth, he has to pay off the credit cards by years end with the allowance you give him from the joint account (actually give it to him, or should literally be just enough to get it paid off and nothing more). At years end, check the account. If he's paid it off, keep the rules in place, let him have his fun money as cash only, and work on your marriage. If it's not, you've got your answer.

My first instinct is to tell you to LTMFA\u2026but something is off here. From what you describe,he\u2019s a great guy when he\u2019s not spending. This is above my internet stranger pay grade,but he sounds to me like a compulsive spender. As I understand it,it\u2019s an addiction no different than booze or drugs. The best thing for your family right now,I think,is for him to get professionally evaluated. Don\u2019t take no for an answer. From there,hopefully,you can decide how to move forward. Best of luck to all of you.", "Asking him to leave has to be the wake up call. If he doesn't change from here, I'm not sure he ever will.

You're doing right by your kids, he's not doing right by you or your kids.  Before, there weren't any real consequences.  Hopefully this wakes him up, but like the other person said he needs help.  Does he not think this will catch up with him?", "Getting through \u201canything,\u201d and \u201cgood times and bad\u201d is fine for illness, job loss, and hardships. But this is deliberate. Whether he\u2019s just not paying attention to how much he spends or is just \u201cbad with money\u201d is irrelevant. He\u2019s opening up new credit cards. That\u2019s purposeful. That\u2019s not oh he\u2019s just bad with money. That\u2019s hiding it. That\u2019s not something I could continue on with past that first time. Of course everyone deserves a second chance. But at what point are you giving fourth, fifth, twentieth chances? I\u2019m not saying leave him because that is not my place. I am however saying, think really hard how the next twenty chances will feel.", "Is he a 'good' father or an attentive and involved father? He has tanked his credit and massively overspent, thus relying solely on you to realistically provide for the family, three times now. A 'good father' actively works towards a solid and reliable foundation for his children. \n\nYou aren't the only one he betrayed. NTA.

I don't think you alone can help him. He needs to go to a professional. It doesn't matter if kicking him out shook him. Spending addicts are addicts. Drug addicts don't change just because they end up on the street. The few that make it out, do so when they're ready and with the right help. You are in your right to step away and only focus on your kids and yourself. I, personally, would let my husband know that while I truly love him, I won't allow his actions to negatively affect my children. I will be cheering for him while he gets help, hoping that he slays this dragon quickly so that he can come home, where we will be waiting for him with open arms.", "NTA, but he needs professional help, therapy or something, shopping addiction? idk...its rough.", "NTA. And sorry honey but you need to change that lock because he will Never change and you owe it to yourself, but especially your children, to have security, certainty and Honesty in your life.", "NTA. But there seems to be a lack of either communication or information in the post. IE, what did he get into debt on. Did you ask to see the bills? Without information this could be undiagnosed secret gambling addiction, in which case you should get divorced and sever all financial ties asap even if you don't split up because gambling debt will fucking ruin you and at least he can just take himself down.\n\nMaybe it's a second family, maybe he pisses away his money on gacha games. None of which excuses him lying and getting into debt hurting you financially but if after 12 years and 3 times you haven't figured out why he's getting into debt that's an issue. Lying and everything else is a problem, but if you don't address how/why he got into debt in the first place you never really addressed the problem, just the consequences of it.", "NTA\n\nbut maybe find a professional to talk things out with.

What happens if you can't work and have no way to pay that 50/50? \n\nEven if this was last kid, same goes. You aren't currently working but you have SOMEHOW continued to pay your share of bills AND saved(?) for a mortgage refinance.\n\nCan you love survive your lack of trust?  Will your resentment eventually crush your love?  How much will/does he resent you that he keeps doing this?  He is sabotaging your family's future and security over and over.\n\nIf you do decide to stay, he needs therapy or something to find out WHY he feels this compulsion to keep spending money he doesn't have(and lying about it).

If they are legal roommates, then her finances shouldn't be tied to his and the new mortgage should be in her name only(with deed also only in her name).\n\nThen he can prove his dadship and partnership by keeping debt free until retirement at least.\n\nNot sure How UK deals with assets for unmarried partners.

Also make it very clear to him that when you say \u201cyou have a year to fix it\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean mom or nan bails him out. HE needs to fix it on his own\u2026 and if you have to tell him and his mother if she involves herself by bailing him out you will divorce, do it.", "When I married my wife I was terrible with money. I had debt for my tires and maxed out my credit card every two weeks - I'd get my paycheck, pay off the card, have nothing left, max it out again. It took years and countless screw ups (including spending behind my wife's back, lying about it when caught, and only coming clean when she was going to file a police report over my \"stolen\" debit card) before I've gotten to a place where I'm remotely responsible with money.\n\nI say all this to say that there may yet be hope for your husband, but it's going to take time and intentionality. It means locking down his credit so he can't open new cards. It means him taking financial courses. It means him asking himself where the money is going, and why he feels this compulsion to spend. It might mean treating him like a child in this area for quite some time.\n\nIt does not mean you trust him to do these things for himself, and you need to ask yourself if it's worth the time and energy. But if he's willing to put in the effort, there is a chance for change. \n\nNTA, and good luck.", "I'm inclined to believe that with the lying and going behind OP's back that this sounds more like an addiction mixed with something pathological.  What exactly is he spending money on, especially this last time??  Where is this $$ going, that's what's concerning me.  I feel like OP has only scratched the surface here.\n\nOP you can't fix this.  He has to want to change this and it won't happen if he continues to be enabled.  Just kicking him out for a few days or weeks will not work and is only a temporary stop gap until the next catastrophe.  He clearly has mental health issues that need to be addressed.\n\nYou have to put your children first.  Also your children are watching and learning.   Parents who are irresponsible with finances tend to have children who do the same.  Is that the future you want for your children?"]}
