Maybe you can put ice tea in a Jack Daniels bottle and drink it straight.. and wear something that shows off your tattoos... Make sure hubby goes something domestic too.", "NTA - there is no way in hell you need to tolerate a complete and utter AH in your own house. In fact prepare your husband what you are going to do if SIL's husband is going to make a sexist remark.

Basically your husband wants you to be okay with being treated like shit and uncomfortable in your own home at Christmas... That's not right.", "Why isn\u2019t your husband hosting his relatives? If he wants them there. He can clean before the visit. He can shop and he can cook. Then, he can clean up after his guests leave.
