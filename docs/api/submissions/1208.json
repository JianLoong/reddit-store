{"id": 1208, "submission_id": "ym414d", "title": "AITA for leaving a 1 star review when they \"tried to fix it\"?", "selftext": "My boyfriend became my fiancee a couple of months ago (YAY!) He wanted to get the ring by himself so I told him I would love a moissanite asscher and that I was dead set on a bezel since I'm \"hard on things\". I sent him links to finished products that I would love. So he had 3 photos, 2w/ links to the crafter \"shop\" and one from a larger maker but with product#.\n\n Where he went sold him on an emerald cut and had him fully convinced that the way they do prongs is just as strong as a bezel. Fiance now realizes that he shouldn't have listened to anyone but me. He apologized when he realized he got to choose every detail of his ring and was trying to for me as well (this is not normal behavior for him btw I have a distinct impression his sisters were in his ear).\n\n I called the store and got the clerk that helped him. She started off letting me know that their prong rings ARE just as strong as bezels since the prongs are reinforced and they require me to come in every six months to tighten it. Then she said my fiance had the ring for \"a while\" meaning 32 days and there was nothing she could do for me.\n\nI thanked the clerk for her time and hung up. Asked fiance if there was a maintenance plan and he was excited to show me since he's forgotten. The maintenance card says 2 checks a year and if the stone falls out anyways the replacement discount varies. Fiancee was bummed because that wasn't what he'd understood. He's extremely intelligent but he tends to trust \"professionals\" in their field far far too easily imo. He got my ring from a popular chain store so I called a friend who used to work there and found out it was likely an \"out of season push\" meaning if an item has been in the store so long they'll add bonus commission to it.\n\nWell, after all that I decided to leave a 1 star review. And in it explained as I did above. I was contacted by the manager of the store the next day saying they actually could see what we could do about an exchange after all, but kept reminding me this was a favor since it's out of its return period. I drove an hour to get there to be assured that the sales clerk didn't mean their prongs were better than anyone else's, just better cared for because of the plan. Then I find out there would be a $300 restocking fee plus %10 of the purchase price since it was now used, and the ring I had originally wanted had also gone up $350 in the two months between him buying it and me standing in the store with the manager looking at options.I had to laugh because that meant the exchange was going to cost 46% of the original ring cost and 50 dollars more than I was quoted for the new setting I want made. \n\nI left.\n\nThe manager has emailed twice asking me at least just remove the one star, as they had attempted reconciliation. I have not. A friend of mine said I was being cruel since I've worked retail and should recognize at the end of the day that's also retail and I might be hurting what they are able to bring home.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667580712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym414d/aita_for_leaving_a_1_star_review_when_they_tried/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
