Especially considering they've told you they intend to leave the house that YOU paid off to her. I'm also going to go out on a limb here and guess that they have no real other assets, since you are still giving them spending money? Which means you very likely won't be getting an inheritance since sister is getting the house?\n\nNope. You have your own family, kids, mortgage, college expenses etc to save up for, and continuing to enable these leeches will negatively impact your own family.\n\nA phrase to remember: \"You don't have to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\" Your kids and husband should be your primary focus.

I can surely see respecting your parents and wanting to make sure they are comfortable but you have children of your own and indeed, retirement comes around A LOT sooner than you think. Has his sister ever helped the parents or has your husband and you had responsibility of their care? It seems as if their investment in their son more than paid off.

On top of that, paid off the entire house? And now they're demanding the deed to the house so they can gift it to their daughter? You are being completely taken advantage of. But what really infuriates me, is the two of you are struggling with your own mortgage while they live in a fully paid off home?! DO NOT give them that house. And you can't give in to their demands, you can't afford this anymore. Your husband needs to start focusing on his own family, he should not be their retirement plan. Consider family counseling with your husband if he's really struggling to cut the financial ties, but this can not continue.", "NTA. No doubt it has been very stressful to deal with this situation . You have every right to advocate for your family's financial needs.

Don\u2019t sign over the rights for the home. That\u2019s so unfair that they\u2019re asking that of you. Also stop giving money since they\u2019re being so ridiculous.

I\u2019ve seen cultures like this and there was nothing they could do to make them understand they didn\u2019t have it. They just kept asking and getting mad. This is tough because they\u2019re just gonna keep asking. Reduce the monthly money to $500, then maybe they will appreciate the $1000. Refuse to discuss the house. It\u2019s not their business. Id even say each time they ask for more money, you reduce what you\u2019re already sending.

Secure yours and their future first.", "This won\u2019t be easy to hear, but you need to start putting money aside TODAY for yourself. If that means working a side job, then so be it. But this won\u2019t stop. Your husband has the weight of familial guilt weighing on him, and unless HE decides to stop giving his parents money, then he won\u2019t stop just because you ask him to. \n\nThis is the kind of situation that builds up resentment between partners, and once one of you resents the other, respect drops quickly. Then it\u2019s done. Once you have lost respect, it\u2019s easy to lie, cheat, steal from the other person. You are going to have to begin to look after yourself and your family on your own, if your husband won\u2019t.
