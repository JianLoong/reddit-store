Not your problem.\n\nI highly recommend that you keep detailed records of everything with your Ex:. Keep a calendar of which days/times he actually has your daughter and include notes of when he turns down his custody/visitation time, keep screenshots of all communication, and keep records of all payments for child support, medical expenses, etc...  Given his behavior so far, there's a very good chance that you're going to eventually end up back in court over visitation and/or support, or that you'll need to report him for unpaid support, at some point in the future.  Be prepared and start documenting immediately.", "NTA\n\nKarma paid him a visit and he didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA. Think he needs to take his own advice of learning to be on his own.", "NTA. Payback for earlier misdeeds seems to hurt. Had he been more considerate and fair earlier you might not be so hardline now.", "NTA - He F-d around and and he found out. Your daughter won't suffer.  I'm going to venture a guess that he demanded 50/50 custody so that he could avoid paying child support.  If that's the case I'll guarantee that you will have her almost all the time because he'll have things \"come up\".  He'll always be a jerk.  Good on you for saying No.", "NTA sucks to suck.", "Nta - I can see why you divorced him.\n\nAlso: keep an eye on him. He sounds like the kind of idiot who thinks you owe him one.", "NTA - for obvious reasons, but, also, that's a hell of a tax bill. $3,600k seems like a pretty big W4 error.", "NTA - it\u2019s your earnings not his. He didn\u2019t sweat for it.", "NTA - Karma's a beeyotch. Do what's best for you and your daughter and don't give a second thought about what negatively effects him.", "NTA. He did it to himself.\n\nAlso Info: is that a typo? 3600k is 3,600,000. How does he owe over 3 million in taxes?", "NTA - stand firm and stick to the official financial arrangement you agreed to when you divorced.  If you start making exceptions to it you will find he keeps coming back again and again.  Same goes for the custody arrangement.", "NTA.

Some people have no self awareness when it comes to asking for favors, even huge ones, from other people.

Custody if you have more custody then you don't have to allow him to claim your child at all.", "NTA. Sucks to be him, frankly.", "Yep! I would limit communication to email and text only so that you always have a record! Also keep a record of any visitation changes.

None of those things are your problems any more.", "NTA.  Who does your daughter live with most of the time?  That's usually how the IRS allocates the deduction.  They may also do alternating years if the time is split equally between you.  Allowing you the tax deduction isn't being \"too kind.\"  Especially if he's taking it the second year.  Really, I think he's trying to figure out a scam to take it every year.\n\nThe tax deduction issue should have been addressed in the divorce decree/custody agreement.  The couches should have been addressed in the divorce decree (specifically \"Husband will keep the couches but will pay half the purchase price of the couches to wife within 30 days of the final decree or the couches will be awarded to the wife.\"\n\nHe's the one who screwed up his W-4.  How does one even do that?  There's a work sheet for it that tells you exactly how many dependents you need to claim, etc.  There's even an option to have extra money withheld.  Never have I known anyone (and I spent 15 years working for attorneys - including tax attorneys) to \"accidentally\" make a mistake on their W-4.  If he didn't have extra money taken out, that's not an accident, that's a choice he made.  I have $15/check taken out.
