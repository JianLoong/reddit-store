Not your problem.\n\nI highly recommend that you keep detailed records of everything with your Ex:. Keep a calendar of which days/times he actually has your daughter and include notes of when he turns down his custody/visitation time, keep screenshots of all communication, and keep records of all payments for child support, medical expenses, etc...  Given his behavior so far, there's a very good chance that you're going to eventually end up back in court over visitation and/or support, or that you'll need to report him for unpaid support, at some point in the future.  Be prepared and start documenting immediately.", "NTA\n\nKarma paid him a visit and he didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA. Think he needs to take his own advice of learning to be on his own.", "NTA. Payback for earlier misdeeds seems to hurt. Had he been more considerate and fair earlier you might not be so hardline now.", "NTA - He F-d around and and he found out. Your daughter won't suffer.  I'm going to venture a guess that he demanded 50/50 custody so that he could avoid paying child support.  If that's the case I'll guarantee that you will have her almost all the time because he'll have things \"come up\".  He'll always be a jerk.  Good on you for saying No.", "NTA sucks to suck.", "Nta - I can see why you divorced him.\n\nAlso: keep an eye on him. He sounds like the kind of idiot who thinks you owe him one.", "NTA - for obvious reasons, but, also, that's a hell of a tax bill. $3,600k seems like a pretty big W4 error.", "NTA - it\u2019s your earnings not his. He didn\u2019t sweat for it.", "NTA - Karma's a beeyotch. Do what's best for you and your daughter and don't give a second thought about what negatively effects him.", "NTA. He did it to himself.\n\nAlso Info: is that a typo? 3600k is 3,600,000. How does he owe over 3 million in taxes?", "NTA - stand firm and stick to the official financial arrangement you agreed to when you divorced.  If you start making exceptions to it you will find he keeps coming back again and again.  Same goes for the custody arrangement.", "NTA. This man took the time to nail the boards together, choose the sheets, and decide on the throw pillows. All that's left is for him to crawl into the lovely bed that he built.", "Absolute NTA", "NTA. Funny how the Uno Reverse hit him with the \u201cYou need to learn how to be on your own.\u201d Too bad so sad.", "NTA. Some people have no self awareness when it comes to asking for favors, even huge ones, from other people. He's not entitled to your money, even if he HADN'T been a dick to you in the same capacity before. Time for him to be an adult and solve his own problems. Don't let him pressure you.", "Now is not the time to worry over whether you were the a\\*\\*hole. Now is a time to relish and appreciate watching what goes around come back around.

I would limit communication to email and text only so that you always have a record! Also keep a record of any visitation changes.
