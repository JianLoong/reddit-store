The wedding was in Calgary which is where my whole family still lives. Everyone else who was invited to the wedding also lives in Calgary but I live in Vancouver. I couldn't afford to go back to Calgary for the wedding so I RVSP'd no. Even though it's only a 12 hour / 1000 km drive or bus trip I had no way to pay for it. The wedding was very formal. I would have needed a new suit which I couldn't have afforded. I had a nice blazer and dress pants that I had in my car when it got totaled. I didn't give a gift since I didn't go to the wedding. I thought that was okay since I didn't go. Daniel has emailed me asking why I didn't send a gift since I was invited. He wants one now. His parents and my grandmother also said it's rude and against etiquette to not send a gift if you're invited to a wedding regardless of if you go or not. His wife who I've never met asked if it got lost in the mail. Should I have given a gift? Was it an asshole move that I didn't?\n\n(I'm doing better now. The last two weeks have been better.

HOWEVER, Danny and Wife crossed the line when they confronted you to ask where their gift was. That's kinda tacky.", "NTA. I looked it up and the etiquette is a little murky on whether you should send a gift if you were invited to a wedding but can't attend. Some sources said it's not necessary while others said that one should still send a gift. \n\nBut even if you had a minor etiquette breach, calling you and demanding a gift was a far larger one.", "NTA. You are not obligated to give a gift. You couldn\u2019t participate because of life.", "NTA. You know what is ruder than not sending a gift to an event you did not attend? ASKING FOR A GIFT from anyone for any reason AND having your family harass someone for a gift. While you didn't do great etiquette-wise (which can certainly be excused), your cousin and your grandmother and cousin's parents cannot be excused for shaking you down for a gift.

I upped it to $100. Even though that extra $50 could\u2019ve gone to other funds.\nI shouldn\u2019t have had to have done that.
