We all are in our late 20s. Our apt is a townhouse with 3b 3b on different floors. My one roommate just informed that her parents are visiting from a South Asian Country to US and will be staying with us for 4-5 months, that's practically like moving in. AITA for not being ok with this situation. I am not comfortable living around parents. Since we are good friends I am ok with 1,1.5 months at max. Our lease allows guest for 30 days consecutive and 90 days in a calendar year. I know if I bring lease legalities, she will get away with it staying for 30 days then staying out for 1 day and then staying back again.Worst case if she still proceeds which she legally can, I have my ways around to make parents uncomfortable by playing adult content in living room all time since its my part of the house too and show resistance. (I will tell my roomate in advance to expect this if she proceeds)\n\nI don't want someone's parents to be all time sitting in the living area, cooking 4 meals a day, and me being practically being restrained to just my bedroom. I signed up to live with people my age for a reason. Need suggestions. Also they will be coming in November to Feb, so they can dodge around 90 day calendar rule.\n\nEdit: They are retired and visiting here as vacation, so will be staying for most part. I recently asked the same roommate I want to get a cat and she said she's not comfortable with pets even if the landlord has no issues  and cat would stay in my room 95% of time and I did respect that.\n\nEdit2: Asking for more rent, more utilities is ok but that's not what I want. I want my mental peace. I cannot just say no because lease says there can be guest 2 per bedroom for 30 days. But there's this unsaid understanding I believe among bachelors sharing an apt to not bring parents to stay for long.\n\nEdit3: Playing adult content in the living room is the absolute last resort to show that I am not ok and absolute low of me. But I don't think people like these deserve any better. I am absolutely ok  welcoming them for short term, a month or so but 4-5 months is almost half the lease period.", "created_utc": 1692918325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160hexk/aita_for_not_being_ok_with_my_roommate_calling/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d also tell her a month to 1.5 months is ok but you\u2019re also risking them just staying beyond their welcome since their initial plan was 4x as long. \nSorry you\u2019re in this predicament. \nIf she doesn\u2019t budge I would ask for decrease rent + utilities on you and your other roommates part.

I cannot imagine just informing my housemates that my parents will be moving in with us for months.

Having anyone stay that long is an absolute no and incredibly rude.\n\nDo you bring partners home?

You claim to be an adult so there's no need to act like a rebellious teenager. \n\nI happen to think its inappropriate for her to invite them to stay that long without all the roommates agreeing to it. However it sounds like she's passed the point of caring. If I was you, I'd tell her you'll move out if she goes forward (and I'd follow through if she does). If you want a space where all the decisions are up to you, you'll have to live on your own. If you're unwilling to move, then you kinda have to be okay with people making decisions without you, even though I personally think its wrong of the roommate to do it.", "YTA, if they need to stay with their daughter then they are likely in a rough spot, if they chip in for the rent, let them in,", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

With the increase of cost financially and concerning comfort/peace in the apartment, it would surely be more appropriate to consider this.
