We sat down and I asked how long it had been since he and his ex reconnected. He told me she added him back a few months ago before their HS reunion, which he did not attend. But said they had not had any communication. I didn't ask to verify, I took his word for it. \n\nI asked why he didn't tell me and he said he should have. He didnt have any excuses. I told him how it made me feel, like he hid it from me and that maybe he was hoping something could come back up between them. He said that wasn't the case, and would never be the case. \n\nBefore I said anything else he deleted and blocked her from his account. I didn't ask him to, he didn't tell me that's what he was going to do. He just did it. He told me he removed her, he was sorry, and that he didn't mean to make me feel the way I felt. He would have felt bad had I done the same with an ex and didn't tell him. \n\nHe said he was sorry, he shouldn't have disrespected me like that. And that was basically it. No big fuss, no denying it. I feel better about it and believe him they didn't actually talk this go around. \n\nI know this post was pretty divided, but I appreciate everyone's opinions. From those that agreed to even those who thought I was controlling. \n.................\n\nMy husband, 28M, and I, 31F, have been married for almost 2 years. I believe my husband and I have a great relationship and marriage. We pretty much talk out our problems, we have the same goals and ambitions, and we're supportive of each other. \n\nSo a little back story. I have this \"gut intuition\" that I learned to follow in my early twenties and it has never led me astray. About this time last year I had a weird feeling...my gut intuition. So I went to look at my husband's FB. Mind you, Im looking at it through my personal page. Im not snooping through his phone. When it popped up, it showed the usual info and then showed 6 people he was friends with. One of which was his EX. His ex he dated for 5 years. The one he bought a ring for and was going to purpose to until she left him for some guy she met at the gym. This had happened when he was about 20. \n\nI brought it up to him, asking when he and her became friends. He said she had reached out to him and he didn't want to be rude (que my eye roll). Apparently she had wanted to apologize for the way they ended (her being married to the guy she had left my hubby for at the time). Well it was \"closure\" for him and he got to get some things off his chest about the way he handled it. \n\nI said cool, now can you please delete and block her. I understand that may be toxic to ask this, but as his wife I just ask he has no prior relationship people on his social media. I do it out of respect for him even though he's never asked. I never want to put that doubt I'm his mind. I just want him to do the same. They don't live in the same city or have friends in common, so there's no reason to have her.\n\nLast week I asked to see his phone so I could look up something since mine was dead. When I say he HOVERED. He HOVERED. Which was odd to me and since then my gut intuition has been going off... so I went to his Facebook and check out his friends... and there she was. But with her maiden last name. She's divorced. \n\nIdk how long she's been back on there, but I'm guessing that's why he hovered over me the other day. I haven't brought it up yet. He works out of town and won't be home until today. But it makes me nervous they have reconnected on Facebook when he knows how uncomfortable I am with it. And his work route changed last month, so it'd be easy for him to stop and see her. There's always traffic and wrecks...so if he's late getting home it can be a valid excuse.\n\nLet me say I love my husband and he's always been good to me. I know I shouldn't let past relationships impact this one... but we're all human. \n\nI plan on confronting him tonight about it. I don't want to jump to conclusions, as you can see what is already running through my head. I just want to know why he feels the need to talk to her/be friends with her if he's married and happy. Otherwise, maybe he isn't happy. \n\nAITA for wanting her deleted and blocked on social media?", "created_utc": 1688057876, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ma7a5/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_delete_his_ex_off/", "score": 374, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This somewhat controlling behavior but I don't think it's too weird. If he hardly talks to this girl, doesn't have the same friends, etc.  There really isn't a point in having her added. Some people will disagree but put simply you made a pretty simple boundary to respect.\n\nThere is also a very important thing I've learned that companies will tell you. It usually has to do with corruption and that you should avoid even the perception of corruption and that honestly goes for many things in life. Why have her added if it even creates the perception of cheating when he has nothing to gain?  The fact he hasn't deleted her makes me a little worried to.", "You are not a jerk, you are normal. But his deleting her from Facebook would not solve a single problem - if there was one.  Apologize for projecting your insecurities instead of concentrating on strengthening your relationship. And confidence is an attractive quality. Gaining confidence will help strengthen your relationship. And only you can figure out how you can do that.  Good luck.", "Info: did he say that he had deleted her, but then she was still on there under her maiden name? That would change my vote because it makes it seem like he is hiding things.", "\u2022 I find it odd that he wouldn't even casually mention to you that she hit him up and that he chose to reconnect with her. If some ex hit me up, I'd tell my partner about it, especially if I decided to reconnect with them or reply to them. If it's all so innocent, there is no reason to hide it.\n\n\n\u2022 I assume he agreed to delete her when you asked, so either he deceived you by saying one thing and doing another, or he added her again later on which again is deceitful, he likely didn't expect you to notice or perhaps he thought you wouldn't recognize her on the list after she changed her name back. Either way, he knew you had an issue with it, yet he chose to keep/re-add her secretly behind your back instead of just talking to you about it.\n\n\n\u2022 The hovering makes it seem like there was something he was worried about you seeing on his phone, meaning there was something he tried to keep from you. My guess would be notifications from apps for ongoing conversations. Is he on his phone more often, seemingly texting? Putting phone on silent, suddenly leaving it screen down, etc? Unless you have a historiy of snooping through his phone, I don't see many logical reasons for sudden and very noticable changes in behavior.\n\n\n\u2022 A lot of the time when someone from the past reaches out to reconnect and \"apologize for their past behavior\", it's really to reCONNECT, as in try to get the relationship back. She cheated on him, married the AP, and now she's divorced/single, conveniently deciding to reconnect with the guy she cheated on which likely happened during the later stages of her marriage ending. And now, she is quite possibly talking to your husband in secret behind your back. No other reason to have someone on the buddy list except to keep in touch with their online lives. In a situation where there is nothing to hide, you'd be open about things. Your husband seems like he might not currently be quite at that point anymore. \n\n\nNo judgement from me, but in my experience, you should never ignore your gut when it's making noise because there is nearly always a good reason for it. Feelings aren't facts, but facts can back up the feelings you have in your gut about something not being right. I would suggest you take care and investigate further before you do anything, whether that is confrontation or apologizing. People get cheated on all the time, often with a former partner, and so many get played for fools by the people who claim to love them, who claim to be truthful and loyal. It won't hurt to get all the available facts in front of you before you do anything else.", "YTA even though I understand your feelings to a certain degree. \n\nIf your relationship is really as great as you say it is, then you should not doubt him whether he has her on FB or not. Also, controlling who someone is speaking to is toxic in itself. You even give him reasons why he shouldn't have her on FB. You cannot decide that for anyone but your underage kids. \n\nYour trust in him seems low, and talking about this specific case is covering the underlying issue, which is your distrust I feel. \n\nDon't hold on too hard, or you may even push him away I'm afraid.", "IDK, I agee - past relationships color everything.  He knows how you feel, he still did it.  So now he's a liar.  Jealousy be darned.  You asked and he didn't do what you asked and lied by omission.\n\nI'm a great believer in trusting your gut.  That being said - my husband is good friends with someone he had sex with - and I'm okay with it.  She's a great sounding board for him.  If he ever does cheat - someone will tell me, I don't have to snoop.  Someone always tells.  And that's from my past relationships.  lol", "I don\u2019t think you and an AH but I think you are borrowing trouble. You said you don\u2019t have exes as friends out of respect for him even though he never asked that of you. To me, this reads as, I would only be friends with an ex if there was something still there and I wouldn\u2019t be able to prove otherwise unless I severed the relationship. This is a YOU problem. I\u2019m friends with several exes. My husband and I attended the wedding of his longest gf before me when we were only dating. Friendships with people who have been more are possible but it sounds like you don\u2019t trust yourself so you would therefore not trust him either. He didn\u2019t ask you to sever relationships for him, and expecting him to do the same is worth a conversation not a demand. \n\nYou don\u2019t seem to trust him and I\u2019m not sure why. The fact that his work route changed and suddenly you think he might be meeting up with her deserves some thought. Has he given you actual reason to think he might be seeing her? Has he cheated in the past? If so, this social media friendship isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s him. But if he hasn\u2019t given you any reason to think badly of him (outside of the hovering over his phone one time) then you need to figure out why you are distrustful. You are married. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard", "I\u2019m going with NTA. This is a boundary I made clear at the beginning of my relationship. No exes.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m gonna say NTA on this one actually despite what everyone else is saying. I do find you to be a bit on the controlling side here and the obsessive side BUT\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with asking that he remove her from social media. Personally I think people should get rid of social media like that (fb, Instagram, etc anything that creates a false sense of community with people you no longer associate).\n\nBut I do think you kind of have to put up with what he does in this regard. If you\u2019re worried he\u2019s still entertaining her as a potential match then being annoying isn\u2019t gonna be the play. \n\nPersonally I think he should remove her from his social media. And in that regard I think he\u2019s being a bit inconsiderate to you. But these things can be complicated. It\u2019s not like just because someone is out of your life romantically, you feel like you should treat them like they don\u2019t exist. So it\u2019s hard to say. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking as long as you\u2019re okay with no being the answer.", "YTA either you trust him and respect his choices or you don\u2019t trust him and move on with your life.", "Before I got married I\u2019d say Y.T.A or at least controlling, since then and going through the same thing (my wife being in the same situation as you) I\u2019ll now go NTA.\n\nIt does sound like your jumping to conclusions a little, but at heart it\u2019s not necessarily not about trust him it\u2019s about not trusting her. This is a woman you\u2019ve never actually met and you don\u2019t know her intentions. He is free to hang and talk with whoever he wants, but sometimes it\u2019s best not to play with fire.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be friends with an ex. It\u2019s *another* to reconnect with an ex after their relationship fails. That\u2019s not simple innocent friendship IMO, if it was, why did she wait until after the relationship was over to contact your husband? \n\nAlso, your husband is purposefully hiding this, and lying to you. You asked him to remove her. He implied he did. Now he added her back, and is hiding it from you. It\u2019s not totally innocent. He wants to talk to her so badly he will lie to you about it and ignore your feelings even though he knows it makes you uncomfortable. \n\nAgain, one thing to be openly friends with an ex. Another to hide it from your current partner.\n\nOne of my ex\u2019s contacted me recently about trying to get into an account that was connected to one of my old emails, and I told my partner about it. I really doubt my partner would have figured out if I didn\u2019t tell them, but being up front about stuff like that is what preserves the trust. If my partner had figured out I was talking to an ex without telling him, it could seem suspicious.", "No offense but it sounds like you trust your gut more than your husband YTA", "I think you need to ask yourself, are you usually a jealous person? Do you get suspicious or defensive over his female friends generally or is this out of character for you? If it is unusual for you to get jealous, you should trust your instincts. Reddit tends to be extremely unrealistic, poor advice about trust. Yes you should trust your partner but they should also be transparent and give you no reason not to trust them. Trust is a two way street. Your husband ls being cagey and prioritising a newly single ex on Facebook over his wifes feelings. That is some pretty big alarm bells if OP is not normally jealous or insecure about his female friends. Given the way he is behaving, I can see exactly why OP doesn't want them to be friends. He is not behaving like a man who is completely over his ex. I actually would ask to read all the message between them and his reaction will also tell you a lot. If he is above board, he will let you look at them but there needs to be a bigger conversation about your relationship. If he is dodgey, he will accuse you of not trusting him even though he is behaving in an untrustworthy manner. My advise is only applicable if you are not normally jealous. If most of his female friends bother you, you really should reflect on why. Perhaps you need to work on your insecurities. Perhaps you are in a toxic relationship where he behaves inappropriately and you are foolishly trying to guard him into being faithful instead of breaking up.", "NTA because your previous relationship has made you insecure. Just remember that he finished that relationship, fell in love with you, proposed to you then married you. You\u2019ve said that you have a good relationship and talk through any difficulties that you have. Keep talking to each other.  Please don\u2019t be confrontational. Let him know you\u2019re feeling insecure. Maybe the fact that she cheated on him affected his confidence and her reaching out to apologise did give him the closure he needed.", "You sound extremely paranoid", "A soft YTA.  I get that this teenage to twenty romance of your husband's ended due to conditions beyond his control.  That must plant the seed that maybe he still wishes things had been different. However, if your marriage is as chill as you state, you've nothing to worry about except your own sense of insecurity.  Many of us have past relationships that ended similarly but most of us have no desire to roll back time and follow a different path.  Not saying that never happens, but young romances often end as this one did and we all move on.  I think you need to discuss your insecurities with your husband and OWN them (not blame him for them) but NOT direct what he chooses to do with his FB account and friends.  I would not like such a gag order imposed on me because of my partner's insecurities.", "See in his fb if he likes or comments her photos.", "NTA \n\nPeople are being too harsh, you deserve to know if someone is betraying you. \n\nMy ex had an affair and I never would have known if I hadn\u2019t went to google something on his phone o e afternoon, literally had no idea. \n\nHe\u2019s entertaining an ex, that\u2019s a ridiculously slippery slope for you both.", "Listen, if you trust him this little that you have to constantly snoop and are wondering where he is if he's late - get divorced. You being suspicious all the time and him having to defend himself constantly is too exhausting for the both of you. If you have no trust, there is no relationship.", "I'm on the fence of YTA.\n\nMy husband is friends on Facebook with both his exes, who he describes as his \"2 past lives of his life\" with me as his current and future \"love.\" It doesn't bother me in the least. Our marriage is solid. \n\nI look at it as if I feel threatened by 2 women who he loved prior to me, then there's bigger issues in the relationship.

He doesn't want to hurt her feelings, but doesn't care about yours.  Personally, I would find it suspicious, because no woman comes before you.", "NTA. He should be a willing partner to make you as comfortable as possible. Don't abuse the power and make him delete all his friends or anything but 1 ex lover is not too much to ask. Also your I tuition is probably not wrong. His route changed just in time for them to reconnect? Hmmm. Suspicious right? Keep an eye on him. Maybe it's nothing but I get the feeling you wouldn't find his messages to her when looking through his phone.", "Absolutely NTA. You asked him to block her ass because that's weird and uncomfortable for you, that should be enough- you're his wife and she's a cheater ex who treated him like trash. Something is not right and you feel it. Trust yourself.", "NTA", "You're a bit paranoid to be fair, but I think I'm gonna go NTA because he is acting kinda shady. If he was hoovering when you had his phone, he's probably messaging with her on Messenger and has something to hide. He wouldn't care if he didn't, no? Even more shady if he removed her when you asked, but then added her back again? Even knowing it made you uncomfortable...\n\nBut, when you confront him, he would have all the right in the world to flip out because it is kinda controlling. But yeah, like I said, he's also acting shady.", "NTA\n\nHe's inviting trouble. He should have told you he readded her. Then, he made you nervous by hovering. There's something there. Find it.", "NTA. If you have a hinky feeling then it\u2019s ok to ask. \n\nAlthough, don\u2019t get obsessed that it\u2019s about her. \n\nIs it near your birthday etc? Or is it the guys group chat going crazy. There may be another reason altogether for the hovering. \n\nYou are allowed to feel uncomfortable about your person being in contact with someone else, especially if you have a previous experience of why you should be uncomfortably. \n\nRegardless of anyone opinions, don\u2019t let it eat at you. You know your husband and your relationship etc. have the conversation.", "Based on additional info in the comments, NTA. Unless the ex is still part of the current friends circle it\u2019s weird that they have started chatting online again and she\u2019s recently divorced. Some people are calling you controlling, but I think it\u2019s entirely reasonable to stick to your personal boundaries and say reviving a friendship with an ex after 3+ years is not ok. Especially when he justifies it as not something he really wanted but he did not to make things awkward. Either way he\u2019s making it awkward for someone and I don\u2019t think he should be ok with leaving his actual wife feeling awkward instead of some ex.", "Y(a bit)TA. You need to relax. If you can really trust him, you've got nothing to worry about. She maybe just wanted to clear the wrong she done to him in the past, and obviously felt bad about it. It's probably just for her to sleep better at night.\nI will not recommend to keep any eye on them.\nJust take a breather and ignore it. Focus your energy on your relationship and be happy.", "YTA. I have stayed on good terms with nearly all my exes. I haven\u2019t gotten back together in any way with any of them.

My friendships are my business, not something to be controlled by anyone else. \n\nJust FYI: Even if your husband complies & unfriends/blocks her, that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s out of his life. It just means they\u2019re not FB friends. They could easily be communicating other ways & seeing each other on a daily basis. They\u2019ll find a way to get together if that\u2019s what they want.

And I'm doing it out of statistics as it really is a pattern and a clich\u00e8.

I believe my husband and I have a great relationship and marriage. We pretty much talk out our problems, we have the same goals and ambitions, and we're supportive of each other. \nSo a little back story. I have this \"gut intuition\" that I learned to follow in my early twenties and it has never led me astray. About this time last year I had a weird feeling...my gut intuition. So I went to look at my husband's FB. Mind you, Im looking at it through my personal page. Im not snooping through his phone. When it popped up, it showed the usual info and then showed 6 people he was friends with. One of which was his EX. His ex he dated for 5 years. The one he bought a ring for and was going to purpose to until she left him for some guy she met at the gym. This had happened when he was about 20. \nI brought it up to him, asking when he and her became friends. He said she had reached out to him and he didn't want to be rude (que my eye roll). Apparently she had wanted to apologize for the way they ended (her being married to the guy she had left my hubby for at the time). Well it was \"closure\" for him and he got to get some things off his chest about the way he handled it. \nI said cool, now can you please delete and block her. I understand that may be toxic to ask this, but as his wife I just ask he has no prior relationship people on his social media. I do it out of respect for him even though he's never asked. I never want to put that doubt I'm his mind. I just want him to do the same. They don't live in the same city or have friends in common, so there's no reason to have her.\nLast week I asked to see his phone so I could look up something since mine was dead. When I say he HOVERED. He HOVERED. Which was odd to me and since then my gut intuition has been going off... so I went to his Facebook and check out his friends... and there she was. But with her maiden last name. She's divorced. \nIdk how long she's been back on there, but I'm guessing that's why he hovered over me the other day. I haven't brought it up yet. He works out of town and won't be home until today. But it makes me nervous they have reconnected on Facebook when he knows how uncomfortable I am with it. And his work route changed last month, so it'd be easy for him to stop and see her. There's always traffic and wrecks...so if he's late getting home it can be a valid excuse.\nLet me say I love my husband and he's always been good to me. I know I shouldn't let past relationships impact this one... but we're all human. \nI plan on confronting him tonight about it. I don't want to jump to conclusions, as you can see what is already running through my head. I just want to know why he feels the need to talk to her/be friends with her if he's married and happy. Otherwise, maybe he isn't happy. \nAITA for wanting her deleted and blocked on social media?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Did it change by a great deal of time?", "NTA- it's not toxic at all to ask that. Trust your gut.", "You need to have a conversation, together, not just you making demands of him and acting like a jealous wife over an ex. Or you trying to manipulate him to get your way. \n\nThey have 5 years of history, he was going to propose. It\u2019s likely she reached out for closure or for ulterior motives. But people need to stop thinking they can erase significant parts of their partners pasts. \n\nMy ex husband hated me talking to one of my exs because \u201cit\u2019s an ex\u201d. Yes, he was.. but he was a fiend long after that. We dated in high school and early college. He found someone else, was honest, we went separate ways. Didn\u2019t talk for years and then one day he reached out to me. We just chatted and talked about our lives now and our kids, etc. he lived still in my home town, we talked about that too as I live states away. My ex husband had a fit demanded I block him, never speak to him, he was just trying to be shady\u2026 \n\nI was doing nothing wrong in this conversations, but at the time I would feel so guilty to even say hi or just ask how many feet of snow in April they had.  My ex and I were friends, we had history despite dating. I don\u2019t even remember what he looked like naked much less anything else so it wasn\u2019t like I was fantasizing over our past. I felt like I had to hide just having a friend I spoke to once or twice a week (if that) because if my ex husband noticed he\u2019d have a conniption. \n\nAll this is to say\u2026 maybe the hovering wasnt how you perceive it. Maybe it was him not wanting to have an issue because he thought you were going to start problems were there are none. \n\nSit down and talk. Actually talk. Tell him how you feel, but leave the choice up to him.  You can only ask, but you need to decide on whether or not you trust him. If things are as great as you say then she doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 she\u2019s closure, she\u2019s history. And don\u2019t turn it  on him to say \u201cwell if she\u2019s nothing why can\u2019t you just block her\u201d. Or the \u201c if it\u2019s just friendship then I can read the messages\u201d.  It\u2019s amazing how subtle accusations can make you feel so guilty and wrong, like you have to hide, when you literally are doing nothing wrong.  He\u2019s allowed to not want to, he\u2019s allowed to maintain a friendship. If that\u2019s a dealbreaker for you then you never really trusted him. \n\n(Disclaimer, my ex husband isn\u2019t my ex husband because I left him for ex. Ex and I talk less than we used to, the novelty of reconnecting wore down and we just sends messages once or twice a month now). \n\n\n\nNow, all that said.. don\u2019t be blind or naive. You know your husband and your relationship. If you feel something is off\u2026 confront it. Don\u2019t hide, don\u2019t snoop, don\u2019t do shady shit. Just call him out and ask ( not accuse) what is going on. Don\u2019t give him the ammunition to tell people \u201c my wife be acting all crazy\u201d because of it ever comes down to him actually fucking up the good thing he has\u2026 he\u2019s the problem not you. \n\nOne more thing. This is nothing on you or him or \u201creasons\u201d, or \u201cfault\u201d, it is just something that happens that both parties overlook;  How routine has your marriage/life become or settled? Might be time to change this up. Weekend getaway. Random outing to a movie or the park. New nightly walks. Whateve.  If youre drawing more of his attention to you (and you him, in healthy couples ways), there\u2019s none to give to anyone else. \u201cDating\u201d your spouse should stop just because you\u2019re married.", "YTA.

Be honest and upfront that it makes you uncomfortable. A partner with good intentions will be mortified that something they did, and can control, would make you feel insecure or sad. It is called micro-cheating. Set your boundaries. \n\nFWIW, privacy is very important, for sure. However, hiding things destroys marriages. On both sides, so don\u2019t hide how you know.

I\u2019d feel pretty hurt if I found out my husband was lying to me about deleting and blocking an ex. Especially now that she is divorced. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask him to delete her off FB at all considering their history. They had their closure, so why would they need to keep chatting? \n\nI don\u2019t agree with everyone saying you are being controlling. You asked him to respect your boundaries, you didn\u2019t force him or hold a gun to his head. I\u2019d be suspicious of him too.

Acting this way will only push them further away. Bottom line, if you can\u2019t trust your husband, the marriage is doomed to fail. \n\nYTA", "NTA. Trust your gut.

So if he was friends with a previous relationship person he would have had to throw them away for you?", "NAH \n\nI think social media can be dangerous for some. \n\nNow, maybe instead of demanding, have another conversation with your husband. Letting him know that although you\u2019d prefer him not being friendly with exes, and are uncomfortable that he speaks to his without issue, you understand that who he speaks with is his business. Just that he should be aware that you are uncomfortable and feel it\u2019s a little inappropriate. \n\nHe may not have done anything wrong. But I do feel that he\u2019s close to crossing the line. Why hasn\u2019t he mentioned her? That she\u2019s divorced and they\u2019ve spoke again? Because he obviously knows it will make you uncomfortable. But little secrets like these can be the first that inflames and destroys a relationship.", "going against the grain here and saying NTA, it is not unreasonable to ask your significant other to not keep in touch with exs. it\u2019s suspicious that he won\u2019t block her and the hovering, you haven\u2019t snooped on his phone or given him a reason to act that way.", "Man, these posts make me so sad about people's relationships.

I would never even consider that they would be tempted simply from being connected on social media. Hell, if they are tempted, and I have to put up restrictions so they don't wander, they are not the partner for me.

Then I noticed she was divorced. He's never cheated. And I know a lot of the issue lies with me and my insecurities. I dated one guy that ruined me.

So I went to his place like three days later while he was gone, he said I could. And I was just hanging out.

No doubt his reluctance to sever contact is him imagining what life would have been like had he married her instead of OP. I imagine OP knows this perfectly well and is one of the reasons she is so concerned.\n\nOf course, if he wants to cheat, he's going to cheat and blocking on Facebook will do bugger all to stop it.\n\nHe absolutely needs to know that he is overstepping and as a married bloke of nearly forty years, I believe he is. I would never have done such a thing to my wife and I believe few married people would consider it acceptable. Certainly I don't think their partners would.\n\nFinally, and then I'll start drinking my tea, it annoyed me to see so many people piling in on OP for saying her discomfort is her fault because she's insecure!
