Through the last month of last semester, an untrue rumor was spread about me by my roommates and has led to hostility and exclusion. My roommates would hang out together *and* go out with the rest of our friend group & go out of their way to exclude me. \n\nWithout giving many identifying details about the situation, the rumor is not at all true and I was shocked by it and am very hurt. I have proof and other people backing me up, but my roommates and friends are all on their bandwagon. The rumor is about a guy. We work together but have never hung out outside of work. I have his number but the only 2 times we\u2019ve texted are once when I asked him to cover my shift and once when he left work early and asked me to finish a task he had started. I\u2019m in a LDR with the person I want to marry and would never do anything like this with another guy. I was at a different friend\u2019s (outside of my main friend circle) apt the night that I\u2019m accused of seeing him. I ran into him that night and found out my friend is his neighbor when I saw him in the hallway, greeted him and had maybe 15 seconds of small talk. At no point did I ever hang out with him or view him as more than a coworker/acquaintance. \n\nI\u2019m inclined to believe that I did something else to annoy them at a different point in time or these girls just don\u2019t like me and are leaning into the rumor to get rid of me, because everyone involved (me, the guy, my friend whose apartment I was at AND her roommate) have all corroborated the fact that I never hung out with him. At this point even if they turned around and wanted to be on good terms again, I\u2019m not open to it. I\u2019ve literally been friends with these girls since freshman year and am beyond hurt and have been having terrible dreams about going back to school and can barely sleep.\n\nOne of my classmates who I\u2019m friends with but not super close has an open room in her apartment and knows about this situation and how stressed I am to go back. Her and her roommates told me I\u2019m welcome to move in, and I already got pre-approved by student life to switch housing. I don\u2019t like to run away from my issues but I want to be able to relax and enjoy my last semester of college as much as I can. The problem is a lot of the communal stuff in my current house belongs to me. I love to cook so I have nice kitchen things including stainless steel pots/pan set, toaster oven, nespresso, and way more kitchen items that would be moving with me. Also, our living room side tables, two lamps, a couple chairs, the rug, the vacuum, and some other random decor are all mine.\n\nIf I give them a heads up that I\u2019m leaving & taking all this stuff with me, they can bring their own stuff from home or buy it before next semester starts. On the other hand I do not want to contact them at all. And I think I may be the asshole for this, but part of me wants them to come back to an emptier house and have to figure things out for themselves.", "created_utc": 1672112219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw5kah/wibta_for_not_giving_my_roommates_a_heads_up_that/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re not running from your problems, you are removing yourself from a toxic situation that is unsolvable because they are committed to destroying your reputation.

Someone said your wanting to give a heads up shows you're empathetic, and they are right. However, as I have learned (I'm older, still tell myself I'm 25, but let's be real, I'm over 50) those who have the most empathy, are usually the ones that get f'd over the most by \"friends\". \n\nDon't waste your time, or energy trying to convince your former \"friends\" that the rumor is false. They made a choice to be jerks, and they are free to be jerks, it's their life.

But, you are deserving of love, and to have people around you that truly care about *you.* Not what you can do for them, but care about you, as a person. \n\nYou derserve happiness just as much as anyone else.
