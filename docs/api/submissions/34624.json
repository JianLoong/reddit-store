How are you \u201cweaponizing\u201d her veganism against her? By eating more meat? That\u2019s for you to choose, just as veganism was her choice. That urging you to get your own fridge meant you had more space for meat was a consequence I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t intend, but that\u2019s no fault of yours.\n\nA second fridge is a bit ridiculous, IMO, but she was all for it so she has little room to complain. It sounds sadly like she is or is becoming the kind of vegan who\u2019s going to try to police other people\u2019s food, so good luck.", "NTA. Your wife is unhinged. I lived with a vegan and she shared recipes and they were delish. NEVER made a single comment about my food. I even took some of her recipes and said, hey I\u2019m gonna add meat to mine, and she was enthusiastic.  I also bought her cookbooks to support her vegan journey. Sharing and learning is key. \n\nYour wife has take a position on moral superiority. Food is so personal and everyone\u2019s body reacts differently. I have a lot of actual medical issues with a lot of plant based diets. Projecting a single diet onto the population is BS. There are healthy ways to eat animal products as well as ethically source these things. It\u2019s all a personal choice though. Like if you both go to the gym or read books - different exercises, different genres. If she pushes it, tell her you\u2019re happy for her to get her own apartment or home. This is absurd - you are being HARASSED and she is using modern relational words to turn it against you - actually weaponizing who you are. This is vile behavior in my opinion.", "NTA. She likely expected that you would get a mini-fridge that doesn\u2019t have a lot of space and so you would \u201cnaturally\u201d start transitioning to her way of eating, because the eating meat and having a small fridge would be too much of a hassle. She tried to weaponize the fridge demand, but it backfired because you\u2019re able to buy in bulk now without having to worry about her stuff taking up space for meat and meat products.", "You did not 'weaponize veganism' against her. She used her veganism to push your food out of the house fridge and now that you have your own she cannot dictate to you anymore. She is the one who tried using her veganism against you. \n\nNTA - she can enjoy her veggies and you can enjoy your meat. **And I bet her next step will be telling you that you cannot 'cook' your meat in the house...**", "NTA. You're not telling her to change how she eats, but she gets to tell you how you should eat? Or dictate how much of something you eat? Nope, doesn't work like that. You did what she asked, she doesn't get to complain now that it's not working in her favor.", "NTA but you can't win. She's committed to creating drama where none exists. \n\nThis is a \"her\" problem.

Weaponizing wearing cruelty free makeup? Lmao", "NTA\n\nShe got what she wanted and is finding new issues to create. \n\nAlso, there was nothing wrong with sharing a fridge with a vegan. My boyfriend is vegan and I\u2019m not and we\u2019ve shared a fridge for years.", "NTA! \nBuying in bulk and freezing can save you a lot of money, what you are doing is making good financial decisions. Your wife probably has an agenda to get you over to eating more like her, and when you bulk buy that makes it a lot harder for her because you don\u2019t run out of meat.", "lol.

Maybe then you will see the light right out the door.", "NTA  - she asked for a special provision for her dietary requirements. You complied at the cost of having to go outside every time you want to eat. She's a little naive (stupid even) considering the cost differentials of bulk buying meat not to forsee you'd make good use of it. You didn't weaponise her veganism against her. You respected her choice that she would feel better if you had own food storage areas but you are not vegan. I suspect this has not ran its course.", "NTA and your wife sounds like a huge one. You accommodated her views and feelings in a great way, not to mention heading to the garage every time you need to get food. I can\u2019t imagine asking someone to use a different fridge because I suddenly decided not to eat a certain food. But super kind of you to do so.

Anyone who ordered meat got an earful so a lot of people ordered vegetarian just to shut her up. Our other former roommate who ate meat was there and ordered her steak medium rare.

He asks her after that \"should I just get a second fridge\" to which she responds \"Yes, you should absolutely do that and get your animal products out of my fridge.\"\n\nSo he does that but she still has a problem with it.\n\nHer ultimate goal is that he eventually just caves and gives her what she wants - a meat free household. He should not do that; her newfound veganism has been more than accommodated.", ">I would encourage you to seek counseling and see if there is a way to work through this in a healthy way, otherwise this will continue to fester and be more and more of an issue.\n\nAbsolutely!

She just gained a ton of space by him keeping his stuff in there.", "More freezer space would make more sense for a vegan diet. But she's the one that told him he couldn't store food in house.

There is no such thing as too much cold storage space.", "I grew up in the country and literally everyone that I knew growing up had an extra freezer in the basement or garage.

I grew up in a very small family and one fridge was more than enough, but clearly my experience isn\u2019t universal. Still\u2026 four? And three just for beer?

If you truly believe that meat is murder (as opposed to going vegan for health or environmental reasons), why would you want to stay married to a murderer? I certainly wouldn't want to be married to someone I believed to be making deeply immoral choices on a daily basis.\n\nUnfortunately OP and his wife may be heading for irreconcileable differences. Or maybe she's just extra aggro about veganism because it's a new change and she'll chill out about it.", "For some people it's a dietary choice, for others it's a fundamentalist faith; unfortunately for OP's marriage it looks very much like she's the latter.", "Or another kitchen,  in another house", "Nah, tell the wife to cook on the grill outside.

So I must have been right the entire time!\"", "Yes.", "From what OP described, it seemed to me like his wife legit wanted him to get the fridge, insisting on it even.
