My oldest daughter is from a previous relationship Hailey (16), and my youngest is mine and Justin\u2019s daughter together Kayla (5). \n\nHaileys dad is physically present but not financially. I fully financially support her by myself. \n\nJustin and I went away for a weekend. We let Hailey stay at the house and watch Kayla. The other option was both girls going to my parents house and they said they\u2019d prefer to stay home. We were paying her. \n\nWhen we got back Haileys car wasn\u2019t in the driveway. We asked her what happened and she explained she went to a party, got drunk, and asked her dad to pick her up. She had planned to pick up her car prior to us being home but we got home a few hours early. \n\nKayla was safe and had slept over a cousins house who is also our neighbor. They didn\u2019t know Hailey went out. \n\nWell Justin was fuming. He was so mad and told Hailey she was grounded for 2 months. He kept yelling about how irresponsible she was being. \n\nI then told Justin in our bedroom privately he had no right to yell at her that way. I also told him he\u2019s not her father and and can\u2019t ground her for this. He then told me he\u2019s her main father figure and I\u2019m undermining him. I told him I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t drive and both girls are safe. We argued for a few more minutes where he essentially thinks I\u2019m an AH letting her get away with this. \n\nI already talked to Hailey and told her I\u2019m proud for calling an adult and we talked about the dangers of alcohol and those parties. I gave her back her keys and told her not to do it again. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n\nHailey was only watching Kayla at night while the girls were going to bed. \n\nKayla regularly plays during the day with her cousin. My sister in law is a stay at home mom and always doing crafts and activities. My sister in law called Hailey and told her Kayla would sleep over because the kids wanted to watch a movie together. \n\nMy sister in law and brother didn\u2019t notice Hailey leave late at night.", "created_utc": 1673230234, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1071nit/aita_for_unpunishing_my_daughter/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t really understand a lot of these replies. \n\nFirst, she was watching her sister and her sister was sleeping at your SILs house. She then went out because she was no longer responsible for her sister. So no neglect or doing anything wrong in terms of her babysitting duties. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s all nice to stay \u201cwell she\u2019s 16 she shouldn\u2019t be underage drinking\u201d but in reality that\u2019s what 16 year olds do. She was responsible about it and didn\u2019t drive. She was even completely honest with you when you asked what happened. You talked to her about drinking and partying so that\u2019s good too. There\u2019s not really a point in any other big punishment, especially because of how responsible she was about the whole thing. \n\nThird, Justin isn\u2019t her dad so he really has no right to discipline or yell at her like that if you don\u2019t want him to. You even did him the curtesy of talking to him privately inside of saying that in front of your daughter. \n\nI guess she could\u2019ve texted you and asked permission before going out? But again this is not anything out of the ordinary for a 16 year old. The other people commenting seem to be in a different reality where 16 year olds don\u2019t drink on the weekends. Overall I think you handled this situation well.", "Going against the grain, but NTA. As far as I'm reading, Kayla decided to sleep over, then Hailey decided to go to a party and was back before Kayla returned. Legal age for drinking is sixteen in my country, so I don't really see the big deal here. Hailey behaved responsibly, didn't neglect her sister, didn't drive drunk.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n\nYou're probably going to have to delete and repost this honestly. You didn't explain properly that the 5 year old was at a sleep over with her cousin at your sil house and that Hailey was not responsible for watching her at that time.\n\nShe did the right thing not drinking and driving.\nYour boyfriend jumped the gun on PUNISHING her. That's something the two of you should have discussed and dealt out later on.\n\nShe has a Father. Who is active in her life. He gets a say in raising her. I'm pretty sure this isn't the first time your boyfriend has gotten upset over something like this.\n\nShe shouldn't go unpunished for what she did. Talking to her like an adult was the right thing to do....but there needs to be some consequence for the poor choice as well.\n\n\nIn the future....no more overnight trips and leaving Kayla with Hailey. That's not fair.. especially when you have family next door to help. That's unrealistic to put on a 16 year old... especially if your husband is going to blow up like that for anything that goes wrong in his mind.", "NTA. At first I thought you were crazy leaving a 16 year old in charge of a 5 year old, but saw your SIL and brother live just down the street, and the 5 year old was safe while the 16 year old went out. In the end, I think you\u2019re right. It\u2019s better that she didn\u2019t drive home and called her dad. And your boyfriend has no right to punish your daughter without your say so. I do wonder if his extreme reaction was out of being scared about her safety? I don\u2019t know what their relationship is like, but I can see someone who has been in her life for awhile and loves her like a daughter being scared about her going out without anyone knowing, and getting drunk.", "NAH- going against the grain here.\n\nIt sounds to me that Hailey went out after knowing her sister would be elsewhere for the night, and took advantage of the opportunity as a teenager does. Should she be drinking at 16? No, but she was smart and responsible enough to call for her adult who was in town to get her home instead of driving. While redditors May not agree with this, they need to realize that they too, were once teenagers. It sounds like she trusts you and her bio dad enough to be honest and not a lot of teenagers have that in their parents. You had a conversation with her afterwards about your concerns, but honestly. I wish my parents had been more open when I was her age: I wouldn\u2019t have done a lot of the stuff I did, if they were.\n\nJustin was worried for both of his kids and over reacted. While the whole comment about him being her main father figure doesn\u2019t sit right with me (if that were the case her dad wouldn\u2019t have picked her up), you can\u2019t blame him for being upset that he was unaware of where Kayla was for a night, and mad that Hailey could have gotten in trouble or worse.\n\nYou did the right thing mama. You were young when you had her, so I\u2019m sure you remember the party nights, but it sounds like your biggest concerns were that both of your daughters were safe. While partying and drinking at 16 aren\u2019t really safe, she made the smartest decision available to her and called for help rather than sleeping somewhere while vulnerable, or driving intoxicated. I don\u2019t think any one here is an ah because of the fact that concern comes out inappropriately sometimes, and Justin made a unilateral decision out of that misguided concern. You, as the main parent are allowed to change the conditions based on your interaction with your daughter.", "You realise Justin's going to throw that \"he's not her father\" comment right back in both your faces any time you want him to take on any parental responsibilities for Hailey, right? And he'll be correct in doing so.\n\nEither you want Justin to have a parental role in Haileys life, in which case YTA for undermining the punishment, or you don't in which case he has no responsibilities towards her in any way whatsoever and you're NTA, but you've effectively decided to split your household in half.", "ESH.\n\nI don't know your relationship with your boyfriend, but you have a 5 year old child with him and live with him. He absolutely has say in the household, regardless of whether he's Hailey's father, *especially* when it comes to her behavior towards Kayla. That said, yelling and grounding her for two months is extreme enough it's not going to be helpful, so he's *kind of*, *barely* an AH for lashing out instead of thinking through the punishment.\n\nBut *holy shit* you're basically praising your daughter for lying to you, abandoning your other daughter, and getting drunk at 16 years old. There do need to be consequences for that, regardless of whether she made one responsible decision at the end of the night or not.", "after reading the updates i have decided NTA  \n\\- your SIL called her to let her know that the sister would stay over night to watch a movie.   \n\\- your daughter who unexpectedly got some free time decided to go to a party  \n\\- Your daughter partook in some underage drinking but was mature enough to call another adult.   \n\\- Your daughter did not fob off the younger sibling, your SIL called to say she would keep the sibling over night.   \nIts not like she abandoned her and all the YTA i assume were done before the edit.   \n\n\nIts easy to say she stole and fobbed off the responsibility but after the update or edit rather it seems to me that she just unexpectedly got some free time afterall.", "So you're cool with your underage daughter pawning off your FIVE YEAR OLD on someone else so she can so get wasted? \n\nYes, she did the right thing by calling her father but you're completely glossing over everything else. She absolutely deserves punishment. YTA", "You left your daughter in charge of caring for a 5 year old. Instead, she goes off to get trashed at some party.

As her biological parent, that's up to you.", "Some people here are literally insane. She is a teenager and believe it or not but they do things like that and it\u2019s not the end of the world. Read the post again, kayla was safe she slept somewhere else and Hailey left after that. You guys act like she destroyed the world. She even called her dad to pick her up so she wouldn\u2019t drive drunk by herself. Grounding her for 2 month is insane. You should have a talk about what she did was wrong and yeah maybe \u201epunish\u201c her a little bit ground her for 1 week or 2 but seriously guys Stopp acting like Hailey did something unforgivable. So ESH/NTA\n\nAnd btw where I live you can drink certain alcoholic drinks from the age of 16.", "This is a complicated one.\n\nNTA for unpunishing her. Justin absolutely shouldn't be doling out punishments without your go ahead, and it seems like a red flag to me that he then gets mad at you for \"undermining\" him when all you did was talk to him in private about the way he yelled at her. That screams to me as \"I'm the man of this house and my word is law\" which yikes.\n\nHailey is also NTA because of the order of events I have gathered: you all decided she stays home for the weekend with Kayla --> Kayla was playing at the cousin's house --> cousin invites her to sleep over --> Kayla decides to go out to a party since she doesn't have a younger sister to watch anymore. Reasonable teenage decision, and she handled it the best way by getting a ride when she realized she was too drunk to drive home.\n\nThat said, YTA for leaving your 16 year old to watch her younger sister for an entire weekend. She might be old enough to be home alone for a weekend (although still debatable in my mind), but she's not to watch a five year old for a weekend, whether she's paid or not. In fact, I might be reading into it, but I wonder if the thought behind your SIL's invitation to keep Kayla overnight was that SIL disagreed with giving Hailey that level of responsibility, and was trying to lighten her load.", "Clearly NTA", "NTA because you are right he is not Kayla's father. So unless you have explicity had a talk about him being allowed to punish your daughter he was out of line. The punishment should have been decided on by you and Kayla's bio dad who you say is in the picture. Also even if he was allowed to punish your daughter then the punishment should have been something that you both decided. Also based on your punishment you and your boyfriend have two different parenting styles and probably need to get on the same page when it comes to the daughter that you do actually share together.", "Your daughter was supposed to be watching your youngest and instead left her at someone else\u2019s house to go get drunk?

Does he help financially and emotionally raise your daughter? \n\nFrom what I read, he has every right to be angry, and \"not her father\" is a pretty hurtful and snobby move on your part.

Partying and getting drunk.\n\nYet you are all like, well I'm proud you didn't drink and drive. Okay well that is a given, but she screwed up. What if she didn't? One right thing, where let's be clear, she shouldn't be in that situation, does not excise the rest.\n\nAt this point, I am on the side of the one acting like a parent....him.\n\nUsing \"your not the father\" honestly feels like a coop out on your part. When you guys go on vacation or time for college, hope her \"real\" father steps up.", "Hold on, you (both) left a 16 year old to watch a 5 year old over a weekend and she promptly dumped the little off on family, drove to a party and got drunk. And you handed her keys back and said don't do it again. Not even going to try and wrap my head around that. Maybe your husband shouldn't be parenting her by whatever agreement you have BUT Kayla IS his daughter. The expectations for her care while you were out of town were shattered. If a non-family babysitter had done that he'd be justifiably upset. maybe he'd agreed to not discipline her, OK, but you're ignoring his rage at how his daughter was treated, whether she was 'safe' or not.

Even without the alcohol, this is indicative of a serious inability to make good decisions, let alone the responsibility to care for your 5 yr old.  To be fair, I was a teen once and I got into my fair share of shenanigans, but I was not responsible to watch a 5 yr old at the time.

From this post, it seems you could probably get your point across with a conversation with her. Let her know both the good and the bad of it.

I recall being a teen vividly and where I\u2019m from it\u2019s totally normal to start experimenting with drinking from an early age, thus we partied responsibly, called a parent when somebody got too drunk or when we needed a ride to get home. \nI\u2019m not from a country where its common to punish behaviour, instead communication and trust is key. Neither me nor my siblings have ever been grounded, we have however had lengthy conversations regarding our actions and reached understanding as far as what is okay and what is not okay. We were expected to behave responsibly and own up to our mishaps. \nIf you and Justin are not on the same page in regards to whether to punish or not, that will create friction. I for one feel that whether your daughter should be grounded for her actions is something that you and Justin discuss in private, and is not something to be decided in the \u2018heat of the moment.\u2019 When I was your daughters age I lived with my mom and step-father and while we could have our disagreements, he never explicitly told me what to do or not. He was a wonderful father-figure but my mother was the parent. My \u2018on a distance\u2019 father was the parent. \nNow, your 16yo did the right thing and I agree that she should be praised for that. Now imagine what happens if she gets grounded for EIGHT WEEKS, the next time she goes out to party (and she will) she might NOT call home. She might opt for a less safe option because she wants to avoid the backlash. That may lead to her ending up in unsafe situatons and we DON\u2019T want that.\nThis is likely to be a highly unpopular opinion, but as I see it, NTA.\nGood luck and all the best to you and your family.", "YTA\n\nYour husband wasn\u2019t yelling at your daughter.

This instance, you\u2019re upset because you believe he took it too far, when you both decided to pay your 16 year old to watch the 5 year old you both share, and at that point he had every right to expect both would be at home all weekend.

They didn\u2019t know Hailey went out. \n\nWell Justin was fuming. He was so mad and told Hailey she was grounded for 2 months.

I also told him he\u2019s not her father and and can\u2019t ground her for this. He then told me he\u2019s her main father figure and I\u2019m undermining him.

There's lots to unpack here. Personally, I would go away for a whole weekend, leaving a 16 year old in charge. Maaaaaybe one night away at a time, with plenty of ongoing culommunication and very specific instructions and expectations. I understand that you're saying your younger daughter is regularly at her cousins, and that your SIL actually made the request for her to spend the night, but in that case I would expect the 16 y/o to communicate that to me the parent. I'd also expect my 16 year old to not go out and get freaking wasted, but that's kind of an aside. OPs bf/daughters father had every right to be pissed as he wasn't kept in the loop about his kid. That's scary for a parent. And if he's going to be a father figure, then expectations need to be made exceptionally clear on what he is and isn't allowed to do. \n\nAll that being said, OP, I'm still going to go with YTA. \n\nI don't think a 2 month grounding is an appropriate punishment, but I DO believe that a punishment/consequences is absolutely necessary. Yes, your daughter showed some responsibility by calling her dad but also showed a gross lack of judgement, and that needs to be addressed.  You should have talked with your BF and made a real, reasonable, fair plan that would have conveyed the seriousness of her decision-making failures while also allowing your BF to feel like he's a part of the family.

First of all, you're irresponsible as hell leaving a 16 year old to watch your 5 year old for an entire weekend. It doesn't sound like you checked on them either.

She probably thought it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal because Kayla was safe and not with strangers. They often play together and probably have some sleepovers. She did a mistake, she is a teenager. OP told her what she did was wrong and that she shouldn\u2019t do it again the danger of parties and alcohol. Again, it sounds like something like that never happened so screaming at her for one mistake was not the right solution here. \n\nIm actually really surprised that i even have to explain something like that to grown adults.", "The SIL arranged with the older kid for the younger to spend the night, which seems like a regular occurrence. Clearly OP is fine with that. You are entirely wrong in your read of the post.", "So,  1.5 overnights. Within reach of a responsible teen and an insurmountable task for an irresponsible teen.  Parents should know their kids well enough to know which camp they fall into", "OP seems clear that she has no intention of behaving as an adult ever. Her primary goal is to be bffs with her teen daughter.  Super great when your only kid is the teen daughter, super shitty when you're relying on that teen daughter", "Yeah, I mean a punishment is in order, but at least she didn\u2019t leave the 5yo home alone unattended. Sounds like OP and her husband need to revisit their views on parenting the 16yo. The step father should have some say, although I think 2 months of grounding for this is a tad harsh.", "The person saying he shouldn't have a responsibility is the mother of the child. Since he has no legal relationship to the child, her mother can decide that he has no authority which is exactly what she did. \n\nI'm saying the distinction should be meaningless but OP has demonstrated that (to her) the live in boyfriend is not a parental or authority figure to her daughter.", "I agree about OP. I was just saying why a step parent and a boyfriend are different. Step parents usually gave clearly defined roles whereas the boyfriend clearly doesn't. He thought he is allowed to punish the daughter, OP disagrees. His anger may be justified but clearly OP doesn't see him as a parent so he needs act accordingly.", "Sometimes people deserve to be yelled at. For instance if you're a 16 year old kid who says you'll watch your sister but instead goes out and gets drunk....", "She is sixteen, she is old enough in many places to be charged as an adult.  The completely lax attitude you and her mother have to things that are criminally chargeable with \"just don't do it again\" is appalling.  She has been shown that even breaking the law is ok because mom and bio dad will not hold her accountable.  And you are assuming this is the first time she has made multiple (not one) mistakes such as these.", "The older kid is not the youngest kid\u2019s parent\u2026 she couldn\u2019t make that decision", "Then I guess BF needs to go.", "I agree, they should have came to a punishment together instead of the stepdad unilaterally deciding.", "I\u2019m just gonna throw this out there, if you yell at teenager, you instantly turn off their ability to listen. If you have a serious conversation and remain calm and let them know you are disappointed with their choices, but happy they are safe you get a lot further. Then you discuss punishment.", "If they're in a country where you can drink at 16 I don't see the big deal, especially if she didn't enthusiastically agree to babysit. This is what happens when you force a young member of your family to do something. She was responsible about it, even if she was doing irresponsible things.", "So instead of them understanding the message all they think about and hear is that you're an asshole. That's productive how?", "You\u2019re still ignoring the actual words in the post. The younger went to her cousin\u2019s (OP\u2019s SIL) house to play, which is something that happens all the time. The SIL called the older kid to let her know the younger was going to be spending the night so they could watch a movie. At no point does the post even imply that the older kid had any part in the decision.", "Yes totally agree!", "No you tell at a teenager then calm down and explain. If you always yell or never yell then everything gets tuned out.", "She wasn't forced, she chose to. She could have went over to grandma's and not been in charge of the sister.", "If they're thinking \"you're an asshole\" after they ditch their sister to go get drunk then they weren't listening or thinking right to begin with.", "I don\u2019t understand how people missed this point in the post.", "But that wasn\u2019t informed to the parents! That decision can only be made by them", "No anything you yell is getting tuned out even if you come back and tell them calmly.", "The teen is definitely an asshole but yelling isn't going to get the message across.", "When have teenagers been known to think right!?!\n\nI mean that\u2019s what\u2019s hard. They have the hormones and emotions of adults but the life experiences of children. That why the stereotype of a difficult teenager is so prevalent.  \n\nAlso from the comments sounds like the cousins asked to have the 5 year old for the night not that the 16 year old asked. She just took the opportunity.", "OP was clearly comfortable with the arrangement because the SIL was close by. You keep shifting your complaint the more information you get. First it was the older daughter\u2019s fault for dumping the younger on her aunt. Somehow it\u2019s still the older daughter\u2019s fault when their trusted relative and neighbor makes the call. Yes, the older daughter was dumb for going out to a party, but the younger was safe with family and not under her sister\u2019s supervision at any time that night."]}
