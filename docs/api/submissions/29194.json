That doesn't mean you can't report it and it doesn't mean that sexual harassment did not take place. It absolutely was sexual harassment.\n\nI also will say that your workplace is not being strict with this - this predator already drove off two other woman before you, **and he is still there**. How is that the right thing to do? He needs to be fired immediately", "NTA.\n\nHarassment is harassment even if you dont say \"i think you are harassing me\". Robbing someone at gunpoint is also robbing someone at gunpoint, even if you dont say \"I think you are robbing me at gunpoint\". Good you reported him. Maybe he gets fired. Sounds like a pattern of behaviour. \nI would say he is probing to see how far he can go.", "NTA \n\nSome people are going to say you are, because you didn't even give him a chance to stop on his own \n\nI disagree \n\nTelling him to stop yourself can be hit of miss;  especially if you weren't even sure if his comments constituted harassment or not, and asked for the advice of a more senior worker's advice before reporting it \n\nWhen in doubt, report it to HR and let them sort it out \n\nIf they have an issue with what he said;  they'll take care of it.  If they don't, you'll get a mild talking to to be more careful about what you report", ">After I got home I spoke to my partner and he told me I was wrong because I should have told him to stop first.\n\nDoesn't matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>he had driven off two girls before me\n\nYour partner dismisses that?\n\nNTA", "NTA. If your partner has never been in a situation where they felt intimidated/uneasy, where they kept quiet just to keep the peace and keep their job, and where their body was commented on by a coworker, then your partner can shut the f\\*ck up. \n\nYou are reporting the incident now so that YOUR COMPANY can tell your coworker to stop. And frankly, the fact that he's driven off two female coworkers and hasn't a) been fired, b) at the very least not been assigned to the same room as other female workers, is a lovely way to get sued. They allowed the problem to continue, and they FED HIM A NEW VICTIM, and that's you.", "NTA Women are expected to be nice and polite. Your partner is an AH and needs to support you. \nI\u2019d probably say something to a coworker like \u201cyou better not touch me the laws are so strict about that now\u201d or \u201coh I wouldn\u2019t say that you\u2019re not allowed to make remarks like that anymore\u201d. Having said that it\u2019s not your job to police this behaviour, it\u2019s his and your company\u2019s.", "NTA you didn't tell him to start either.", "NTA he should have never done any of it.  You shouldn't have to tell someone to stop it.  He is being so inappropriate and good for for turning him in.  He obviously has a history of this so I doubt he would have stopped if you told him to.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to tell them to stop for it to count as blatant sexual harrassment. Everything he is doing is wildly fucking inappropriate - tell on him, girl.", "NTA, you do not need to confront your harasser, but you need to report him.  He showed up at a coworker's house, what was he hoping was going to happen? In today's society everyone should know better than to make comments about another person's body.  Why did he change jobs?  Was he let go from the previous job.", "NTA The fact it sounds like he drove off multiple other people with his behavior and that it seems he exclusively doing this when you were alone, and more vulnerable should tell you he knows what he\u2019s done is wrong. The only AHs here are your coworker for the obvious harassment, and your partner who apparently has more sympathy for a complete stranger who is obviously in the wrong over you.", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to tell someone they\u2019re harassing you for it to count as harassment. He was absolutely out of line and he sounds like he might be a danger to you if you tried to solve it on your own, you did the right thing by reporting him.", "NTA. it's not your responsibility to confront a coworker acting inappropriately, this is exactly what HR processes are for. if he showed up at somebody's house, that's scary and dangerous! not directly confronting him is protecting yourself. so sorry you experienced this, my skin is crawling on your behalf :(", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to manage his behavior. Any suggestions that you bear that responsibility is victim blaming. He knows what he's doing is wrong. Telling him to stop may have been futile.", "If he was unaware, then he will be made aware. You are not obligated to ale the risk of shutting him down. If he truly did not know better\u2014hard to imagine of course\u2014then HR is obligated to tell him and train him. Chances are that he knew and you won\u2019t be the first. HR will weigh the risk of keeping him and make a decision. That\u2019s all well above your pay grade.", "NTA.  He knows what he is doing and you shouldn't have to give him a warning to stop before you report him.  There is zero tolerance for sexual harassment!!", "NTA. Assuming you are in the US, you do NOT need to confront the person who is harassing you or making you uncomfortable in order to have a legally valid Title IX complaint.", "Yeah, I'm gonna go with NTA here.  You shouldn't have to tell him to stop.", "Absolutely NTA. If you wanted to pursue a legal claim of sexual harassment, you'd probably be in a stronger position if you had told him to stop, and if there were a longer history of him doing this stuff to you despite your protests. But that's not your question -- the issue is whether it was ethically the right thing to do to report him to the employer, so that the employer can decide whether to take action regarding his behavior. Absolutely it was. The factors that support this conclusion are: 1. The actual unwelcome touching. He needs to know that he should not be touching anyone in the workplace. That's way worse than just making some comments. 2. His going to a coworker's house. That's really creepy. Again, that's not something that would necessarily help you if you brought a legal claim, but it definitely shows that the employer needs to take a look at this guy. 3. It was not just one comment, you mention two comments. If all it was was just one creepy comment, maybe you'd let it go, but it is part of a pattern. Bottom line, if you were the employer, don't you think you'd want to know about this guy? I think so. You are probably doing your employer and your co-workers a big favor by reporting this. (I'm basing the legal stuff on US law, not sure if that's where you are, but obviously doesn't change my opinion).", "It's not your job to tell him to stop, with some people that's inviting trouble. He was harassing you and you did the right thing. He'd already caused two other women to quit!\n\nYour partner is wrong. NTA.", "NTA He shouldn\u2019t have to be told to not sexually harass someone. You wouldn\u2019t feel guilty for reporting a robbery even if you didn\u2019t tell them you didn\u2019t want to be robbed.", "NTA. It's not on you to manage him. Yeah, it would have been good to tell him to stop, but he shouldn't have imposed himself on you in such a way that you had to in the first place. Your partner isn't seeing your point of view. Of course you want to keep things civil and kind of pretend it's not happening so it doesn't become openly hostile.", "NTA. This is human resource departments/upper management are for. There is no need to engage the harasser directly (if you don't want to). Completely reasonable.\n\nPeople shouldn't need to be told to not be creeps.", "Nta, doesn\u2019t matter if you told him stop for the first incident was enough to report him. He is responsible for his actions. This repeated behavior. \n\nYour bf is ah for victim blaming you.", "NTA - his comments are absolutely disgusting and inappropriate for a professional environment. Whether you told him to stop or not doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s in the wrong. How did he get your coworkers home address? Does he have access to employee info? Can he find your address?", "NTA HR needs to get involved since he CLEARLY has a history of it. Telling him to stop doesn\u2019t erase that fact. The guy is a creep. It\u2019s very intimidating as a young woman to try and stand up for themselves to older men. Society has taught us not to and that we should be flattered. That it\u2019s harmless. Regardless of the fact it very much is anxiety inducing and harmful.  \n\nYour partner is wrong to tell you you should do something that makes you very uncomfortable. Especially when you\u2019re the victim.", "NTA. That\u2019s inappropriate workplace behavior no matter what. You report it, its not your responsibility", "NTA\n\nThe guy clearly has a history of driving girls off. What he did and said was inappropriate, and if he doesn't see it, then he needs to leave the workforce or re-educated himself to be better. I could exuse some weird mention that might be offensive once or twice but the guy is clearly testing your boundaries and he found where it stops.", "The little tiny touches and comments they THINK they can get away with, over time, end up adding up to so much discomfort across so many people. Even though each instance could be waved away. The straw will break the camel's back, and this was that straw.", "A million times NTA. You are not obligated to warn your harasser before reporting them for harassment. In fact, warning them can lead to more complications if they try to retaliate.\n\nAlso, your significant other should be your support right now. The fact that he sided with the harasser is heart breaking and I think you should think long and hard about whether he will be in your corner when you need him because it doesn't seem like it.\n\nGo meet someone that deserves you.", "NTA. Your partner is victim blaming. He's a dick. And while it is preferable IF YOU FEEL SAFE DOING SO to give a person the opportunity to fix things before reporting,  this isn't always realistic.  If you didn't feel you could,  then reporting him is the best option", "NTA. He sounds like a creep. He made you feel uncomfortable and according to your senior coworker he has driven off two other women already. That is enough to report him. Don\u2019t feel bad about it.

You are under no obligation to deal with him directly yourself before escalating to HR.", "What the fuck is wrong with your partner? Fucking clown", "This. I studied HR management and worked in HR for several years. We do not put the responsibility on the victim to stop the harassment. That\u2019s so messed up.\n\nOP, you are not an attention seeker. Your coworker is the wrong one for harassing women and making the workplace uncomfortable for others. He brought this upon himself.", "this is aita not r/legaladvice", "Definitely generational.  The older ladies a my job hug and kiss on the cheeks, lead by putting hands on lower backs and make off hand remarks about muscles.  I always just pass it off as well meaning contact.", "Saying please makes it sound like an option. Just say, \"Don't touch me.\"", "That isn't how consent works", "eww", "Yikes!", "Sexual harassment and sexual violence aren't little things that upset women. They're harmful and dehumanizing behaviors that should outrage anyone.", "Didn\u2019t help me get anything thank you.", "Exactly. There\u2019s no reason to tell him to stop. He knows what he was doing isn\u2019t appropriate, but a lot of people just don\u2019t care. He\u2019s gotten away with it for so long he\u2019s not even concerned. \n\nI\u2019m wondering about her partner saying she was in the wrong. He should be supporting her for standing up for herself."]}
