Either way\u2014 maybe present her with something she can do with her time instead of working for no pay. Like hanging out with you.", "Hospitality and food service managers need to be able to respond to anything. Does the hotel or restaurant just not open for the day cuz people didn\u2019t show? No, that\u2019s on the manager to cover. This is quite literally in her job description as a manager.", "INFO: does she get reimbursed for the work she does while away from work?

Also, if you wife wants to advance in her job then working to rule is hardly the best look when up for a promotion. \n\nNow, if you wife responding to messages is genuinely impacting family/couple time, by all means have a conversation around how her work is making you feel and see if you can come to a compromise.

I mean if you are well-prepared on that route, NTA, get a lawyer, etc.\n\nIf not, you kind of need to understand her field more to see under what circumstances she can sue for wrongful dismissal by not responding.  And then you have to make sure she can get replacement jobs which would be kind of tough because once the words get out that she sued her former employer over these minor issues, It's hard for the next company to hire her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She does not need you telling her what to do. She is fully aware of what she is doing.", "INFO: How much extra work are we talking about here? Say, on an average week, how many messages/emails/hours are we talking about here?", "NTA - Most likely she has a toxic boss who's manipulating her with the promise of \"career advancement\" or some other nonsense. I also used to work in hospitality and I've seen the exact same scenario many times and 99% of the time there is not a positive outcome. Either the person burns out severely or they simply get replaced by a another stooge (no offense). Besides, it's hospitality not healthcare. There are few situations where an email can't wait to be replied to during working hours.\n\nAlso, I don't get why some people are calling you TA for simply trying to look after your wife's well-being.", "YTA. It\u2019s her job, not yours, and she knows how things work significantly better than you do. Even if you were in the right here, you run the risk of being seriously controlling in trying to force this; she is obviously capable of making these decisions herself.", "Fair enough, but I wouldn't complain. I've offered her to take a break and find something better if she wanted to. I make enough to support us.", "I\u2019m often shocked at the constant workplace trauma that exists in, I\u2019m assuming the USA. Imagine thinking it\u2019s normal to have a job where you can get fired for not working for free outside of work hours.", "Many jobs are task dependent, not time dependent. You\u2019re paid to accomplish a specific set of tasks and achieve specific goals, not punch a clock. Those jobs are often better paid as well.", "The annoying thing is, it's never stuff that's her responsibility or things she's already taken care off. Like rosters not being to her boss's liking but she's done them for very specific reasons and he can't be bothered to check before messaging her. Or ordering  some extra ice cream when there are supervisors on who are paid to deal with that", "The business is a restaurant, not open 24 hours. Expectations were not to be available 24/7 just to work the hours rostered at work and staying back occasionally or maybe covering a shif here and there. That's not what I have a problem with. The problem is  having to respond to messages on day's off and all hours pf the day.", "The business is open 24 hours; it\u2019s not reasonable to expect just one person to cover all those hours so if the company is cheaping out on staff by not having multiple managers work in shifts that\u2019s not her problem. If it\u2019s essential to have someone present (mentally at least) all the time then it\u2019s essential to pay that person for their time.", "Just because American work culture has indoctrinated y\u2019all into believing that, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. Stop letting these companies take advantage of you.", "She has a salary for 40 hours a week. And no, she doesn't get reimbursed for it. I had a 40 hour contract when I was a retail manager and did 65 hours a week instead, no compensation. I eventually got paid for all those hours after taking them to court.", "I've said in other responses, staying back a little or starting earlier to help out here, and there is fine that's part of the contract. The problem is the messages at all hours of the day.\n\nAnd when it comes to working reasonable overtime, availability. The same workers' rights apply across any workplace, here at least, so I don't see how that makes me an ass for saying everyone has the same rights.\n\nI do agree with the last statement and I will look at approaching it differently in the future", "Overtime is covered under the fairwork agreement, doesn't matter what job you're in so I know she'd would be okay but that doesn't mean her boss wouldn't find another reason to terminate her if he wanted to. She can keep doing the overtime if that's what she wants, it's just annoying", "Most of the time, they could just go to her boss when she's not on, but they don't because he tells them to problem solve. They are supervisors and should be able to do that anyway. Some of the stuff is her fault,  like she doesn't want others ordering because if something goes wrong, she gets the blame. Regardless of everyone having the training to do so, some choose not to follow it properly. She can't write anyone up either because her boss won't back her half the time", "I'm telling her that she's undervaluing her time. Her pay isn't that great. She definitely deserves more for her skills and experience. She continues to do the same things with the same outcome and the promise of more in the future, when she's been fucked over several times already. If pointing that out makes me an ass I will stop doing it or think of a less confronting way to help her", "Time wise it's probably not that much a few hours a week, it's just the constant interruptions during dinner, family time", "I see it exactly the same way but I do understand why she's upset, as other have pointed out. It probably comes across as me telling her she's not making the right choices. \n\nLile you said, I just want her to not get burnt out and fucked over but a different approach may be required", "I'm not arguing about knowing how her job works, I'm just annoyed with shitty companies taking advantage of her. I'm not making her do anything. It's her choice. I'm just telling her she is worth more than free labour. I can accept being an ass bringing it though", "Does she want something \u201cbetter\u201d? This comment is really making it seem like you\u2019re only gonna be okay if she quits completely or accepts whatever job you pick. She doesn\u2019t need to be financially reliant on you.", "In this case then maybe you need to change how you communicate with her.... Maybe don't fight with her about her doing work outside of her work hours. Instead, maybe you can tell her that you support her in doing what makes her happy but remind her that there's ways to find a better work-life balance.", "Yep. I\u2019m American but hyper aware of how F-ed up our workplace culture is. So many people are either unaware or to indoctrinated to see it.

I never said it was reasonable, I\u2019m just speaking objectively as someone who has worked in both industries. It\u2019s pretty common knowledge so if she has a problem being \u201con call\u201d then she presumably would\u2019ve turned down the job.", "If it was in the contract she signed, she\u2019s obligated to abide by it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She\u2019s salary. So YTA, but I do understand where you\u2019re coming from.", "Salary isn't for 40 hours.  Salary is for doing a job. Sometimes, that's outside regular work hours and more than 40 hours. \n\nYTA for thinking you get to dictate her work life.", "Are you referring to the Fair Labor Standards Act? If so, yes, overtime is covered, but lots of salaried employees are overtime exempt, so it DOES matter what job you\u2019re in.\n\nWhether or not your wife is entitled to overtime should have been clearly outlined in her employment agreement. Either she should have been clocking those hours and getting compensated per the agreement this entire time, or you\u2019re making an issue out of something she agreed to as a condition of employment; it seems far more likely to me that she understands the conditions and is operating within them.\n\nFWIW, I have worked in food service for years, and it *is* more or less industry standard for managers to be somewhat available (within reason) even when off. This doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t have lives, or that they need to drop everything to deal with every minor issue. But the fact is they are responsible for the establishment they manage, and situations will sometimes arise that require their input even when they\u2019re not there.\n\nEquipment/plumbing/electrical/internet/delivery/stock issues, medical emergency, robbery, fire\u2014 no, these things don\u2019t happen all the time, but absolutely any of them could happen at any time, and most would necessitate manager contact. Additionally, a lot of corporate chains REQUIRE manager contact before lower level employees can address some of these things on their own, even if they\u2019re entirely equipped.\n\nDifferent companies have different structures for supporting work-life balance for managers, and it should absolutely be said that a lot of companies don\u2019t do enough on this front. Starbucks is hardly the pinnacle of best practices, but it\u2019s where I work and the most relevant example I have\u2014 when managers take vacation, another local manager is assigned to their store as a proxy, so that there is someone available to run point while their time off is protected. Your wife may need measures like this put into place, or better support in the form of an assistant manager, if she doesn\u2019t have one.\n\nBut \u201cdon\u2019t answer the phone\u201d is not a viable solution or suggestion. She\u2019s doing her job. YTA.", "Management generally doesn't get paid overtime, so the incentive from the upper level management would be the lack of promotion or the first one on the chopping block (with or without severance).\n\nAlso the lack of ability for the management to find a replacement who wants to do unpaid overtime would be an incentive for her boss to keep her there.\n\nMaybe make sure she knows that irreplaceable employees don't get promoted.", "At this point it sounds like you\u2019ve made your position on this clear. She absolutely might be getting taken advantage of, yes. But she also might not be. Without knowing her or her workplace personally, we have no way of knowing! Regardless, there isn\u2019t anything either of you will gain by your continuing to harp on it since she\u2019s also made her position on the matter clear. Putting her on the defensive isn\u2019t gonna help anyone, and could actually make her less likely to admit something is wrong. If you\u2019re able to just listen to her and help her feel supported in the job she is choosing to continue to do, it might even make it easier for her to want to quit and find something else eventually! You never know.", "By something better I mean a place that treats her with respect and values her. I don't care what job that is. She does want that but is worried aout leaving", "She's too close to the situation to see it. I've been there and someone else pointing that out helped me see that but I understand, not everyone is the same", "You have not seen the contract many salary jobs still stipulate ours on average worked. Mine says anywhere from 7:30 AM to 5:30 PM average of 40 hours.", "Um, what does salary have to do with it? That doesn\u2019t mean they own her 24/7", "40 hours is what she's paid for, plus occasionally staying back and having a longer shift or maybe covering a shift. Being available all the time isn't a salary expectation nor should it be", "She had been promised a promotion and was meeting all the goals, because she was doing the job with no extra compensation. They then hired some else for the job she was doing. She knows they're going to keep doing that if she puts the free work in but she also keeps hoping they will reward her", "Oh come on. 99.999 % of the time companies ARE taking advantage of the employee in these situations. Even in the instances where they are not, it\u2019s not okay! \n\nAmericans need to get out of this mindset that companies can do whatever they want. It\u2019s what allows this kind of garbage to continue. \n\nNow you can still argue op is an A H in this situation but don\u2019t pretend that the wife\u2019s company is more than likely taking advantage of", "Yeah that's fair", "That's my thoughts exactly, reasonable overtime is one thing but that's a couple of hours at work here and there, not being reachable 24/7", "If she is a manager, she is responsible for her people and her department. It doesn't matter what time of the day it is. Who do you think is going to pick up the slack when she doesn't answer the phone?\n\nBut either way, it's her job, not yours. you don't get to control her actions.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t disagree\u2014we\u2019ve normalized worker exploitation to a pretty ridiculous degree. My point is more just that we don\u2019t really know much about her job & she\u2019s made it clear how *she* feels about the situation, so OP needs to find a way to let it go or risk upsetting her further.", "Some contracts include hours for a salary. Some pay stubs will even say salary 40 hours."]}
