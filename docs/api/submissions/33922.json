The only reason you remembered we even existed is because your husband and his he\u2019ll spawn dumped you at Christmas.", "So dude that was a harsh way of saying what needed to be said, but I'm not sure if there is a way of sending that message without being harsh. Definitely NTA!", "NTA- Let her die alone please", "NTA\n\n\nShe did this to herself.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t even ask for an invite, because she\u2019s a coward. She hinted. I, for one, both *hate* hinters, and *love* them because it\u2019s one thing to deny a direct request, but it\u2019s another entirely to ignore a hint.\n\nMaybe this will be the wake up call she needs, maybe it\u2019s too late. Doesn\u2019t matter if it doesn\u2019t matter to you.", "This is a difficult situation with a lot of pain and I understand that. It might have been better for you to have had that talk with her in a less fraught moment. But you are not wrong. She made her choice.", "NTA\n\nShe spent years making her bed", "It was cruel, but it was also a long time coming. NTA.", "NTA. She has the relationship she earned. OP, I would keep reinforcing these boundaries.", "NTA.  Tell her the backup kid and his family are permanently unavailable!", "NTA, you told her right she had no use for you until she was by herself. Then she remembered she ACTUALLY HAD A BIOLOGICAL CHILD!!!! You told her right, and the truth hurts but she brought it on herself. She has been a fool to chase behind people who treated her so poorly hoping one day they would come to love her as a mother figure. The one person that had unconditional love for her was a distant memory, and she didn't even consider you would stop trying to get her attention and affection.\n\nNow she has to sit and think of how things got so out of control, and all she has to do is look in the mirror.", "NTA you said what needed to be said.", "NTA. No, I think you summed up the situation pretty well. She's realizing that her actions over the years have a huge consequence. I wouldn't have had shit to do with those kids if that was how they treated me.", "NTA\n\nYour mom abandoned her own child to chase the children of her new husband. Sucks for her but those are the facts. Now, your mom gets the life she worked so hard for. She lost her own child. She never had her husband\u2019s kids and her husband chooses the adult kids over his wife.", "NTA.", "NTA. Just tell her to spend the holidays with the kids she gave all of her attention to instead of you. Oh, wait\u2026.", "NTA; she made her bed. Now she has to sleep in it. Why would you want to give her the chance hurt your children the way she hurt you? She took your presence for granted, and now will have to work hard and reflect on herself if she wants to have a chance at a relationship.", "NTA\n\n>Cruel\n\nYes\n\n>out of line\n\nNo", "NTA. That said, let it go. Have your boundaries, enforce them if she tries to cross them. Just live your life now, and let her live hers. She\u2019s made her choices, she hurt you, but you don\u2019t have to carry an ounce of that weight anymore.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't second best. Your mom treated you as if you were & was cruel in disregarding you.\n\nYou then had that most difficult of realisations, that your mom was never going to give you what you needed & found the courage to move on.\n\nYou were totally okay to say what you did to  her. Your wife & kids are your family now.\n\nI so hope your mom got the message you are not & will never be her default/second option again.\n\nI wish you & your family every happiness OP.", "NTA. She either can't or won't admit how badly she treated you. Live your best life", "NTA.   If she sees you as cruel and out of line then she has to admit she raised you to be as she has been cruel and out of line for years.  She can be alone on the holidays because she killed any relationship she had with you.  You get what you give.", "NTA you being ignored basically your whole life and \"mum\" didn't care until she's left high and dry and \"suddenly\" needs you.\n\nNope not going to fly.", "NTA for all the reasons expressed in the other comments.", "NTA I would suggest you just block your mom since it seems to be a reminder of your childhood and maybe in the future you can consider a limited relation with her\u2026 I could never imagine discarding a child for step kids who hate me guts! She made her choices and need to realize choices has consequences and she can\u2019t waltz back into your life after practically abandoning you growing up and ignoring your wife and child!", "[removed]", "ESH. This is if you are just done with her. I understand that she has mistreated you and chased something that she is never going to get in favor of you. I think letting her sit home alone and sit with this for a while is nor an asshole move either. You are protecting your peace and your children. Until you work on your anger issues I think bringing the children into it is out of the question. I do, however, hold out hope that your mom now realizes what she's done and hope that she can come to you with a real apology for how she treated you and that you can be willing to move forward in having a relationship with her.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for standing up for your family, break that cycle!\n\nI'd go NC with her, tho", "NTA", "NTA Tell her she hasn't treated you like a loved one in well over a decade, why should you treat her like one because she is bored?", "NTA.\n\nI'm glad you got to get your feelings off your chest, and if Mom thinks your words were cruel and out of line, she might want to sit in the dark and re-run \"The Best of Mom.\" It will be a short reel.\n\nI am sorry for how that must have felt all those years; I'm glad you now have your own family to love and be loved by. She'll never have that - by her own choice.", "Hope she's good with not getting to see grandchildren cause I'm sure she'll never get to see their kids and you just cut her off from yours so... Definitely NTA.", "NTA", "Glad you didn't inherit her glutton for punishment gene. She worked really hard on making her bed and we know the rest.", "Continue moving on from your mother OP. You will be happier. Good luck. NTA", "NTA, it turns out actions have consequences and she's now having to face them. You pointing them out isn't cruel, how she treated you from 7 onwards was cruel.", "NTA. She burned her bridges with you when you were younger. She doesn't get to just waltz in your door as if all of her neglect will be forgotten. You told her the absolute, unvarnished truth. It isn't your fault if she doesn't like the mirror that was held in front of her.", "She fu@ked around and found out. Good for you for speaking the truth.", ">assumed if you weren\u2019t yelling at her than you must still love her.\n\n\nOf all the comments, this makes the most fucking sense. Doesn't make noise = no need to care", "I\u2019m not sure wanting to be with her husband is fair play. He\u2019s made it clear where his priorities are. That she persists in her lack of self-awareness is tragic.", "I feel like mom is so abused and beaten down that she is incapable of showing op love anymore..or anyone but joe and the step kids. I feel like her self esteem is rock bottom and she is defiantly needs therapy....but OP is NTA for protecting his child and wife from her.  I just feel bad for OP mom not having the strength to deal with the situation for so long and becomeing the door mat the step kids treated her as.", "Good idea.  Send her a copy of this post and the comments.  Tell her to read, there will be a test.", "I agree with the first part Joe is def a Huge AH he allowed it to fester until it was too late try and change the behaviour\n\nBut i disagree with the second part the mom is no victim she decided being with a man was more important than her own well-being and son that's why she was trying so hard to please the kids so joe wouldn't leave her", "She was exceptionally selfish with her love. She directed all of it at kids who hated her so she could impress her man, and left little to none for her own child who needed her and who was entitled to her attention and nurturing. She only spent emotional effort on projects she thought would benefit her directly. That is the epitome of selfishness.", "Why does she waste her time with a man that let's his kids call her a whole and say they wish she was dead?

I don\u2019t get abuse or downtrodden at all.

By focusing exclusively on them, with no real consequences for poor behaviour, she taught them to use her as a metaphorical punching bag and OP that he couldn\u2019t compete whatever he did. \n\nThere are AHs here but OP is NTA.", "Seriously. \n\n*No* dick is so good that it's worth twenty years of contempt from two people PLUS wrecking your relationship with your child PLUS having the man attached to that dick say, \"You're on your own for the holidays, I choose the people who hate you.\"", "OP does say Joe tried to stop his kids being mean to his wife and his stepson. But it looks to me like Joe's first priority was always his kids, especially after their mother died: but OP's mother's first priority was always Joe, which led her to making Joe's kids her priority over her own kid. The lack of self-awareness in thinking that since she wasn't going to be with Joe or his kids for Christmas that would mean she could just summon the attention of the kid she'd ignored and who she certainly wouldn't have wanted to see for Christmas if Joe had invited her to go with him, is... stunning.", "Exactely! It seems Joe did what he could to stop except cut contact with his children. And henshould always prioritize his kid's and OP's mom should have learned that with him."]}
