The details are super personal, but just know it was horrible. Things were said on both sides that can never be taken back.\nThe night of the fight she put in her two weeks notice (she was my mothers home aide). Two weeks from that day I was having major surgery (which she knew), and would now have no one to take care of my mom (she\u2019s bed bound and needs 24/7 care). \nThe day after I told her I was considering taking her phone and her car, both of which I pay/paid for. The car is in her name and we had a contract for repayment, which she has long since broke. She ignored me and went about her day. \nThe next day was my birthday. She came into my house (she doesn\u2019t live in my house), wished me happy birthday, and proceeded to toss her phone and house keys at me, and then tells me since the car is in her name she won\u2019t give it back, and that if I want it back I\u2019d have to take her to court. My mom insisted we try to come to a resolution, and she ended up screaming at me that there was no way I was getting the car back. Remember it\u2019s my birthday!\nThe rest of the week went on with her refusing to finish out her two weeks, even though I wouldn\u2019t be home. The only person she screwed over was my bed bound mother. \nWe haven\u2019t spoken since then (it\u2019s been just over a month now). She never even tried to find out if I was ok from my surgery. As a household we have agreed that we\u2019re done with her and her attitude and behavior.9\nSo now I really want to take her to court for the car because she obviously won\u2019t pay anything on it anymore and I\u2019m out thousands. Along with other things she owes me and my mom for (which also equals thousands).  So would I be an asshole for taking her to court to recoup the money she owes?", "created_utc": 1696734840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172orkw/aita_for_wanting_to_sue_my_daughter_for_her_car/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I put them both out to college and/or work.  Both claim I did the best thing for them to realize what real life was like. They are both grown with children of their own.  My oldest 5 grandchildren were raised that way too and are doing great, in their 20's and 30's, as is my daughter.  My son is 15 years younger and has 3 very well behaved children. He and his wife plan on doing the same.  My 2 are both very successful in their careers and in life.   Prayers help too!  As you can tell, I am a very proud mama, but it was not because I waited to teach self discipline until they were grown.  They had chores earned spending money and I picked my battles carefully so as to not have them smothered.  They started Chores by putting toys away cleaning their rooms, making beds, and other chores before allowance day. Saving was required, of a small percent of their allowance.
