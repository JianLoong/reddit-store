The details are super personal, but just know it was horrible. Things were said on both sides that can never be taken back.\nThe night of the fight she put in her two weeks notice (she was my mothers home aide). Two weeks from that day I was having major surgery (which she knew), and would now have no one to take care of my mom (she\u2019s bed bound and needs 24/7 care). \nThe day after I told her I was considering taking her phone and her car, both of which I pay/paid for. The car is in her name and we had a contract for repayment, which she has long since broke. She ignored me and went about her day. \nThe next day was my birthday. She came into my house (she doesn\u2019t live in my house), wished me happy birthday, and proceeded to toss her phone and house keys at me, and then tells me since the car is in her name she won\u2019t give it back, and that if I want it back I\u2019d have to take her to court. My mom insisted we try to come to a resolution, and she ended up screaming at me that there was no way I was getting the car back. Remember it\u2019s my birthday!\nThe rest of the week went on with her refusing to finish out her two weeks, even though I wouldn\u2019t be home. The only person she screwed over was my bed bound mother. \nWe haven\u2019t spoken since then (it\u2019s been just over a month now). She never even tried to find out if I was ok from my surgery. As a household we have agreed that we\u2019re done with her and her attitude and behavior.9\nSo now I really want to take her to court for the car because she obviously won\u2019t pay anything on it anymore and I\u2019m out thousands. Along with other things she owes me and my mom for (which also equals thousands).  So would I be an asshole for taking her to court to recoup the money she owes?", "created_utc": 1696734840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172orkw/aita_for_wanting_to_sue_my_daughter_for_her_car/", "score": 1178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He and his wife plan on doing the same.  My 2 are both very successful in their careers and in life.   Prayers help too!  As you can tell, I am a very proud mama, but it was not because I waited to teach self discipline until they were grown.  They had chores earned spending money and I picked my battles carefully so as to not have them smothered.  They started Chores by putting toys away cleaning their rooms, making beds, and other chores before allowance day. Saving was required, of a small percent of their allowance.

Daughter borrows money from mom/grandma. To pay back money, daughter works for mom to care for grandma. Daughter doesn't get paid enough to meet her expenses and must borrow again. Thus forcing her to continue working for mom, never able to break the cycle. Indentured servitude.\n\nThen I read OP's replies in the comments. The vague answers and lack of clarity definitely imply the conclusions others have come to:\n\n1) The daughter was \"contractually\" obligated to initially work 15 hours per week, but the rate has not been disclosed so likely at a rate well below market average for at home care. (OP wants to compare daughter's wages to a previous job. Apples and oranges.)\n\n2) This being a situation where daughter was employed by family, there is little doubt that the daughter was being \"volun-told\" to help with her grandma outside of her obligated 15 hours. OP admitted that additional hours were eventually \"agreed upon\" after OP could not help as much. And still, the pay rate is hidden.\n\n3) The daughter was likely making well below minimum wage if her pay was divided by the actual hours she worked.\n\n4) OP admitted that she often held things (which I assume included debts) over her daughter's head. Emotional abuse to reinforce the power dynamic which keeps daughter at a financial disadvantage so OP can continue receiving cheap care for grandma.\n\nTo anyone reading, never work for someone to whom you owe money and never borrow money from someone for whom you work. This puts you in a position where the other person has all the power in the dynamic and they will use that to take advantage of you.\n\nDaughter was smart to have put the car in her own name so that OP at least can't repo it. I'm not sure if daughter lives with OP and grandma, but I really hope not for her sake. Any attempt by OP to sue for the car just comes across to me as further financial abuse since OP no longer can extort daughter for home care.", "There are a few things here that are confusing me.  \n\n1.

When pushed for more details, you state that it was about 15 hours a week, but that she then started helping you because you were sick.  So how many hours did she work at the time she gave notice and how much were you paying her for that?  Also how much did you take back from her pay for rent and food?\n2.

I tutor and get paid 30\u20ac (which is slightly more than $30), and I don\u2019t even have to get off the couch for that (I mostly work online). Considering how much more difficult being a carer is, she should definitely be paid more.", "Exactly.

I suspect OP is the caregiver on paperwork.\n2. She collects payment for far more than 15 hours per week\n3. She \"pays\" daughter for 15 hours a week at an hourly rate less than what insurance is reimbursing OP for. This \"pay\" is of course under the table. Daughter is also doing far more than 15 hours per week.\n\nOP is vague on details because she is committing a variety of fraud crimes with her little setup. \n\nDaughter has been underpaid and on paper has no taxable income. \n\nThe health insurance company (or whoever is ultimately footing the bill for Grandma's care) and the IRS are going to be all over OP. \n\nOh, and I'd also be digging into the car deal.

It came to a head,  where I verbally assaulted her, then threatened her to take away gifts and items used in the under the table job. This backfired. She gave the gifts back and kept the car in her name,  she's paid back in unpaid labor.  I wanna sue to teach her not to ever take away my control again.  Also your honor..it was MY birthday! MY DAY!

I will buy you a car and give you a job, but you have to pay me back for the car. Your job will be taking care of your bed bound  grandmother.\n\nHer mother was her employer.
