Infact it sounds like you are  co-parenting well.  It was a photo book of your son! \nIf it was photos of you and your wife together... Then you'd be the asshole.\n\nHe husband is just insecure and needs to get over it. You have a son together your going to be in each others life.", "NTA. I'm assuming here that the photos only featured your son, and not you. It's your ex's current, and your stepsisters who are being TA.", "NTA you didn\u2019t give her an intimate partner gift. You have her a gift as a coparent. And it\u2019s sweet and wonderful, and I wish my kids father were able to do something like that. I love that you are reaching your son that you can get along with someone even if you two didn\u2019t work out as a couple.", "NTA. You share a child. The gift is central to the child. Your ex\u2019s husband and your stepsisters sound like total jerks though.", "How dare you help your son to make a lovely present for his mothers birthday. People might think you're being good parents and putting your child first. Absolutely disgusting /s\nNTA", "NTA. Most of the comments have covered all the bases perfectly but the only thing I would like to add is that it I find it somewhat concerning that her husband is contacting you at all.\n\nIn co-parenting arrangements, it\u2019s usually best to keep the discussions between the actual parents. As valuable as step parents can be, they should not interfere in the co-parent relationship. \n\nThey also need to understand that the child\u2019s needs for stable relationships with his parents do not end when there is a divorce or remarriage.  Kids thrive best when divorced parents get along and step parents are supportive of that.\n\nI\u2019m curious if this is the first issue that has come up.  If so (and that would surprise me) there should be a tactful discussion with your ex wife about this situation and you can look for ways to try to mitigate the new spouse\u2019s insecurity before things get worse.", "NTA, that's such a thoughtful gift idea. Having a child with someone means you're going to be in each others lives even if its not romantically! Plus it must be amazing for your son to see you and your ex have such a healthy relationship with each other, and how you respect her as a mom.", "NTA. That is a very sweet and adorable gift. The new guy is just jealous. I bet that gift was so much better then his.", "NTA - this was a very thoughtful gift that you and your son put together to help share his experiences with his mom.\n\nHer new husband sounds like an insecure and immature person that is obviously threatened by the bond with your son and good co-parenting relationship with your ex-wife.  There was nothing intimate about the gift.  You may want to share the texts from the new husband with ex so that she knows what is going on.  Eventually, she will have to deal with it.  The stepsisters need to just keep their comments and opinions to themselves.", "NTA. So you helped your son, who is 8, give his mom (your ex) a scrapbook/photo album about him and her husband is being salty about it? That's a perfectly normal kind of gift from a child to a parent, it's not intimate - it's about the child. Unless there is a bunch of stuff about you and pictures of you in it?", "NTA - if her husband is insecure about a photo album of his stepson, then he has a big problem.\n\nKeep doing that great work with your kid and including her mom, looks like you are doing great coparenting", "NTA It's more for your son's benefit so it's not creepy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds really nice.", "NTA. NTA at all. I think you are being extremely generous and just a good co-parent. You two share a child. That is the key component in making this not creepy.", "NTA. My ex and I share photos of our daughter all the time. I\u2019m fact, my husband also shares photos with my ex. We have photos of all 4 of us, daughter, me, ex and my husband. Thats how good coparenting works. We are all involved and support each other. We take my daughter to buy gifts for her dad, and her dad takes her to buy gifts for myself and my husband. The one year my ex and daughter made a photo collage for me. \nYou are doing the right thing. Don\u2019t let him stop you from being a caring parent.", "Her husband was out of line saying anything to you about it. She loved seeing her child's adventures. It was a thoughtful gift, nothing intimate about pictures and drawings, of and by, your mutual child. Her husband is probably jealous because he didn't put as much thought into a gift for his wife. That's on him, not you. It sounds like you and your ex are doing great at co-parenting. NTA", "NTA. Her new husband sounds possessive and controlling. This photo album would be weird only if it was a bunch of old pictures of you and her only but this was purely an album for her to feel like she was with her son during these fun trips and moments in his life. That husband is the asshole", "NTA. If it only contained content including your son and did not include anything about you, then I don't think it's weird at all. You are a caring dad to not want your son's mom to miss out on the parts of his life she's not around for. If you included things about yourself though, that's where I would say it's a little weird. Again, if solely son content, then I wouldn't consider it intimate just because you helped him make a nice gift for his mom.\n\nSide note: I understand her partner might feeling a little out of place about such a thoughtful gift from an ex, some people are just insecure because there will always be a relationship between their partner and their partner's ex when a kid is involved. But he takes it too far in calling it creepy and inappropriate, or accusing you of trying to win her back, because none of these things are true. He's showing his jealousy and insecurity.", "NTA.   \n\n\nFrom the sounds of it, it was more your son's gift to her and that you helped compile with him. You did say \"our son helped me make it and my son gave it to her for her birthday last week\". You were not at the party AND your ex texted you to thank you and say she loved it. That is all that matters! Her husband's discomfort is her business. If he can't understand this is a gift from your son, that's on him. It's not like it's boudoir photos of you ffs!! It's photos of your kid, photos he took, and copies of his drawings and notes. This entire gift is centered around your son!!! Who would get mad at that? It's so thoughtful and it wasn't about you.", "NTA unless there's lots of pictures of you in there and some dick pics slipped in. :D \n\nSeriously, it's an extremely thoughtful gift and she said she was happy to receive it. It sounds like her hubby is insecure and that's something he needs to work out perhaps with a therapist.", "NTA \n\nIt was a gift from your son that you helped with. I think it\u2019s sweet and it\u2019s important that your son sees that you and his mom can get along. \n\nHer husband need to grow up", "NTA. You are a great coparent. Don\u2019t let the insecurities of these people make you feel bad.", "NTA. What a kind and generous gift for her from her child. Coparenting can be difficult. It\u2019s good to see parents putting their children first.", "NTA.  It was a very touching and thoughtful gift that you helped your son give his mom.  What the step dad fails to realize that when people who are divorced share children, there will always be a family bond.   It sounds as if you are doing a great job being a good co-parent.", "That is a most excellent and any mom would be happy with it. Ignore Mr Butthurt - he thinks you're bragging because you can afford vacations and he's jealous. As long as there weren't shots of you in a speedo, you're clear. I'd make it a tradition to do an album with your son every year... but I'm an ass", "Wow I\u2019m in shock at the thoughtfulness of the gift. I applaud you and no NTA your a dope dad and ex. It\u2019s beautiful that you want to have a great relationship with your ex. Y\u2019all share a child and that\u2019s important", "Nta it went so different than what I was thinking from the title. I thought you were giving her a photo album of you and you and her.  You guys sound so awesome co parenting like adults should. Her jealous husband should just stay out of it and let the adults keep on being a good remodel for your son.", "How is a scrapbook an intimate gift?  It was a thoughtful gift that she will cherish and I think that is probably the problem her husband has with it.  NTA!", "Yeah that\u2019s what happens with mixed families. The parents can try to move on, but they\u2019re still in each other\u2019s lives bc of the kid. \n\nVet out your SO like you would vet out cars, houses,jobs whatever.", "No pictures of me, a couple photos included my mom and my nephews, but most were of just my son.", "Even more so you're NTA, then. It sounds like there're some jealous people who think you are - don't listen to them. It was a well thought out and considerate gift."]}
