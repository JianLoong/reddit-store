Sure you owe him some money, but it's he demanding you pay him back first?", "You need to get your priorities together.", "YTA I do not recommend lying to your BF you\u2019d be better off really telling him your feelings , why you want to spend the money & having a mature conversation about this - he may surprise you & agree & he may dig in his heels and say no but either way when your honest you don\u2019t have to have a good memory to keep up a lie if he finds out you lied ( which he may very well ) it may make him wonder what else you\u2019d lie or are lying about", "Lying about money, especially, is wrong and a relationship killer.  So don't do that.\n\nWhere this gets interesting for me is you paying half the mortage- are you on the house or just him?  You seem to have covered a lot while unemployed.\n\nDo you have a payment plan with him?  You can still spend money while you owe it, just not in lieu of paying it back to someone.  Meaning - if you can afford the ticket or tickets and paying back rent, that's fine.  Still save as much as you can with the job and repaying him.  \n\nI would ask if he wants to go, say it's your treat, and if he says no - you just go with your friend.  If he gives you stuff about you going -  you've had a rough year as we all have, have some fun.", "YTA. You owe him 6 months rent but also have savings??? You are nothing but a selfish parasite and should be ashamed of yourself \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "YTA if you owe him six months rent you do not have $100 to go party", "Hope he leaves you- YTA", "\"I have repeatedly offered the money in my rent envelope to him and he refuses, as well as any extra funds I have come by.

If I lied about the tickets being free it might hold of a fight\u2026. For a time.", "He was the one who offered for me not to pay rent. I would have still payed and have offered him some when I could and he refused it. I was still able to pay all my other bills and buy all of the groceries and household items. Rent is the only one unpaid per his insistence.", "I actually prefer staying in most of the time myself but I like getting out every once in a while and especially with him because it means we\u2019re actually spending time together. I\u2019ve spent the last 6 months home (as I should have) and now that I am back at work I feel like going out isn\u2019t as much of a problem. \n\nThe reason we fought about money wasn\u2019t because he was struggling and falling behind, it was because he seems to think money is the only way to contribute. \n\nI\u2019m just so tired of fighting with him.", "Has he been making excuses or is it the fact that we\u2019ve been living through a pandemic?  It might be that he prefers staying in and the pandemic was a good excuse but I hardly think the last three years are good indicators of anyone\u2019s appetite for staying in vs going out", "He skipped her grandmothers FUNERAL to play video games! WHY IS SHE STILL IN A RELATIONSHIP WOTH SUCH A HEARTLESS PERSON!", "Prolong it. Duh", "I was in a relationship where my partner was always broke.\n\nUltimately, I got tired of paying rent while he was using his money for fun things and I dumped him. I was struggling every month to pay for all the things and couldn't afford to go see a movie, while he was buying expensive tools. Not fun.", "It will cover $200 of the amount she owes him, why not start there", "Your friend is impressive. Follow her lead. Put your finances and family first. Say no this time.", "If you lie, it could very well break his trust in you forever. You're spending beyond your means and lying about, which most partners will take as a gigantic red flag. Think about whether this NYE ticket is possibly worth losing your relationship and accomodation over.", "Yea if you\u2019re anxious and there\u2019s been fighting, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s supportive or amicable. Sounds like you have deeper issues.\n\nLying would only make it worse. And I\u2019d really just leave anyone who made me feel like I have to lie (be less of myself and my values). \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind me asking:\n\n- what\u2019s your agreement to repay him? How much a month and when would it start? If this is unclear, tell him what you can afford and from when. It\u2019s a discussion, if he fights walk away until he\u2019s ready to discuss.\n\n- why does he decide how you spend your NY or how you spend your money? \n\nAnd lastly, do you really think he\u2019s supportive or is he controlling and superior towards you? Cause maybe it\u2019s in your best interest not to live by his terms and not to engage in any fights or any of it. Sounds like you\u2019re living anxiously because of him\u2026\n\nETA: I\u2019d go anyway for NYE and have the discussion/fight with him after. As they say \u2018apologize later, don\u2019t ask for permission\u2019 (or lie) ;-) invite him along, and give him the option to not go. But be firm you are going. Ignore his guilt trip or condescension and leave. Get ready at your friends place and sleep there (backup plan) so if he\u2019s uncontrollable you have somewhere safe to stay and can deal with him on the 1/2 of Jan.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t workout, you can pay him back the back rent from a new place on a longer timeline. I\u2019d never stay unhappy or stressed for that", "As long as there aren't parties to go to.", "Have you tried gaming with him?", "Then why lie at all?", "Well, I guess you liking to go out was a poor way to phrase it - but you two don\u2019t seem to be getting quality time at home either. I agree you should be able to have one night out after many months of restraint, especially if you don\u2019t make this a habit. He should understand that too, and needing to lie to make it happen isn\u2019t the answer\u2026\n\nYeah, the whole \u201cmoney is the only way to contribute\u201d thing is a another convo entirely. I hope he does his fair chair of household duties now that you\u2019re working again.", "You need to have an honest conversation with your bf. Yes you need to pay him back as agreed but it sounds like you\u2019re both super unhappy. \n\u2022You\u2019re paying down his mortgage when your name is not on the deed \n\u2022He doesn\u2019t see any of the cooking/cleaning you did/do as a contribution \n\u2022Sounds like he just escapes reality by playing video games 40+ hours a week\n\u2022You\u2019re trying to kinda trick him into having a good time with you by saying these tickets were gifted to you \n\u2022You said you\u2019re just so tired of fighting with him \n\nI\u2019m not gonna say you\u2019re an A H but I\u2019d definitely say you should reevaluate this relationship.", "And on the fact that going out on NYE is just incredibly miserable.", "We don\u2019t know she\u2019s spending above her means.\n\nOnly that she\u2019s got a debt - with no clear repayment plan - that her bf would use against her. Debts get paid in reasonable amounts - they don\u2019t mean you can\u2019t live your life meanwhile (unless you\u2019re bankrupt etc. Of course).\n\nI wouldn\u2019t assume he is right to control her spending because she accepted his \u2018loan\u2019 of paying back rent later. And mind you it\u2019s his mortgage, he could manage on his own - so she is responsible for not trying to skate free, and he\u2019s not being that out out (like if he was a renter also). I don\u2019t get why people assume he\u2019s in the right? Cause OP feels bad? Her feelings were indicators of stress when I read it, not him being right and her untrustworthy (I sensed that\u2019s the narrative he\u2019s put on her).\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t assume someone who stayed home for 2 NYE and stressing this much about one splurge - is regularly overspending. She\u2019s got a savings and is conscious of it even after 6 months unemployment - that\u2019s not an overspender. She kept paying her part while unemployed - not an uncontrolled overspender.\n\nI can overspend, we justify ourselves way earlier than this lol\n\nAnyway, to me it reads like he doesn\u2019t want her doing things and spending on certain things - her debt enables him to exert this control. But that\u2019s not how debts are meant to be managed and repaid. He\u2019s an AH based on what I\u2019ve read imo", "I play on occasion but like him I get sucked in and could spend hours playing and then nothing gets done.", "You, uh. You tell him he's spending too much on video games. While you want to blow 200 bucks on a party AFTER he's been financing you for months.\n\nMind blown.", "> Ps. I\u2019ve talked to him about the games and how he spends too much time on them, but nothing changes.\n\nYou owe him probably thousands of dollars... Not the one to lecture about spending right now", "She didn\u2019t tell him he\u2019s spending too much money on the games, it\u2019s too much TIME on them.", "Spending **time** not money", "Why would the bff risk anything like that on her first big event?", "My dude, it's a brewery. Not the Met Gala. Breweries are incredibly casual environments. The room is going to be full of dudes in cargo shorts. And if she were in charge, she'd have the ability to bring a +1 without there being a risk.", "Yes, hope OP answers this"]}
