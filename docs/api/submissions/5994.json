Why would I fuck someone who gives so little of a shit about me?", "Yes you did contribute very much. Paying someone to clean, cook, and have sex with him would cost far more than $500 a month.", "It\u2019s more that this is a special occasion. I have cancelled and/or ignored a lot of things with my friends over the last few months but this is special.", "How?", "Because he's been keeping a roof over her head . OP is a user . \n\nYTA - if you have 200 spare that you can blow on a night out , that should be going towards paying your debt off \n\nIf you aren't happy with your relationship generally then stop using him to support you and pay your own bills", "Idk. I\u2019ve tried talking to him about it but nothing seems to change. During my unemployment I\u2019ve given him a pass but now that I\u2019m back at work it is harder to ignore.", "\u201cSounds like you want more time together and to form memories together\u201d that is exactly what I want.", "I didn\u2019t get a job for the sole purpose of getting him off my back, I was looking for a career change and took my time to find something that would be a good fit, but fighting over finances was a big stressor in the job search.", "From who? Because if I had a partner not paying rent etc for six months who suddenly decided to drop a hundred bucks on a party without telling me, I think I'd be in my right to see HER behavior as the red flag.", "Me or him?", "She\u2019s got 3 kids so I don\u2019t hold it against her", "This is messed up. Sounds like you want a daddy not a partner.", "Most of us don't pay for sex. Weird that you listed it as an expense.", "So be honest with him.", "At the cost of lying to him\u2026 you\u2019re gonna be single soon enough, no good relationship comes from lies likes these\u2026", "Unfortunately, that's what being a successful adult is about: balancing priorities. This will not be the last time you'll have to give up fun activities for actual responsibilities. There will always be something fun you can do in the future. Go if you are set on it, but know that this is a learning moment. Lie to bf and eventually face the consequences for one night of possible enjoyment or find something to spice up what could be a wonderful night in with him and pay your debts.", "That's not as important as being honest in your relationship.", "Every comment you make makes you look tone deaf and dumb", "Lol. You gave him a pass because he was supporting your ass and the only thing between you and homelessness.", "If you have to lie to get time with him, that\u2019s a much bigger issue/problem.", "Hope he dumps your poor lying ass", "Oh, honey with every answer you are looking worse and worse. You need to start acting like an adult, you aren't a teen anymore.", "You 100%. You decided to bide your time so much in finding a job and contributing to expenses to placed that much of a strain on your relationship, not to mention the stress your partner probably felt. This is unbelievably selfish. All your money should be going towards bills, and paying your debt. Not a frivolous NYE party. Your priorities are way out of whack. YTA", "And you have a truck load of debt so she won't hold it against you when you don't go.", "If I could afford to take care of my partner I would, what\u2019s mine is their\u2019s. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to bust their ass and miss out on shit to \u201cpay me back\u201d in the situation OP is in unless I didn\u2019t actually give a shit about the person and wanted them to suffer needlessly. Literally wild to me.", "A dude paying for sex is way less bizarre than a dude expecting his long term partner to pay him $3000 in \u201cback pay rent\u201d for his mortgage that he can clearly afford without her help. In my world, anyway. I literally cannot fathom asking a friend, let alone a partner, to pay me back for something like that unless I was struggling financially.\n\nThe only way I can see where OP\u2019s guy would be justified is if he had to take out loans or rack up credit cards to make up for her not paying $500 a month since she lost her job.", "How? I\u2019m trying to understand all viewpoints here.", "He helped you keep a roof over your head for *half a year*. You're willing to lie to him to go party when you can't afford to.", "You keep saying you spent your own money. When you owe someone money you don\u2019t have \u201cme\u201d money. Your money is their money because you owe them. How do you not get it!?!? This is making you come off as dumb. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that you stayed in for 3 years in a row. If you were unhappy about that you should have said something and you guys could have compromised. Also this has nothing to do with the fact that you want to behave in a shitty way. When your BF finds out that you lied to him he will never trust you again. You will absolutely lose him. \n\nThe fact that everyone has said that you\u2019re the AH and explained why and you still don\u2019t get it makes you look dumb. Do some self reflecting and imagine if the shoe was on the other foot and he owed you money and lied to you about spending the money on a party. \n\nYour friend sounds like a reasonable gal and would totally understand that you have money issues.", "Are you guys both on the mortgage?"]}
