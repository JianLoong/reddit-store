Give you an allowance, you're NOT his kid... You're his wife. He needs to get off planet 1930's and realize he is lucky you are doing all that you are doing. He needs to grow up... locking himself in his office? Really? Maybe he needs to be put in timeout instead. Men like this do not need to be married. He should be supportive in your choice to go back to work and sorry unless he can prove those aren't his kids... He is responsible for them as well not just you. You basically sound like his nanny and maid more than his wife. Money that comes into the household should be spent together not the \"man\" because you owe him. He owes you then for wrecking your body to have his kids, he owes you for cooking, cleaning, doing his laundry, shopping for his needs as well as the household needs and his errands. Your list of he owes you is going to be much longer and costly than his because most women do more in a day than a man does. This \"man\" needs a reality check that he needs you way more than you need him. Yes, he can probably find another woman to take your place in a heartbeat but not before he is going to wind up having to pay child support and give you half of everything he seems to think he solely owns. I was married to a guy like this before... I was fresh out of HS and didn't know any better but when I wised up especially once the abuse started he regretted his ways. I am in a 50/50 relationship now.. actually my husband does a lot more for me because I am always sick but he doesn't say I owe him. Happy to hear you got your education and you can support yourself and your kids if you decide not to put up with his selfish self anymore.", "This needs to be fake. Because How you can let someone treat you like this and not be hiring a lawyer, I will never understand.", "NTA, and it is extremely concerning that he thinks your salary should go to him while he gives you an \u201callowance\u201d from it. Absolutely not. OP, this is beyond AH behavior\u2014 this is controlling behavior. You gave up your career to raise the kids and saved your family so much $$ in childcare costs as a result. Now you are more than justified in desiring a career again and not just forking over your hard-earned money to your donkey-brained husband.", "Oh dear. He IS an asshole. 100% \n\nHe wants to have continuous financial control. Red flag. \n\nEvery woman should have her own account with control over her own money.", "NTA.\n\nGet him to take a week off work and do everything that you do in mananging the household and the kids' routines.\n\nGet him to do it without blowing his top in the early morning rush and being patient with the kids's babbles when they want to tell you about their day.", "No, sorry, he ends to do 100% of the childcare for four years as he owes you. NTA. I can't even believe men like this exist.", "Shoot he's lucky all you did was yell.\n\nI'd serve him Divorce papers for that bullshit.", "I do not think you are an AH, but your husband sounds like one who is verbally and financially abusive.  What he said horrifies me.  He had better change his attitude and fast, or you had better start saving money for yourself and planning an escape from your husband.  kt", "Assuming this is real, how did you bring three kids into this mess.   YTA because there is no way this guy wasn\u2019t throwing red flags 9 years ago.", "NTA Go to school and \"agree\" to his terms. When the last tuition check clears, file for divorce.

Go back to work and ask him to pay for a babysitter/house help etc.. You can't be his maid forever.", "He sounds like an ass. \n\nDon't waste your time asking you're the AH. You're not. I would support you in what you're doing, las. And if he can't accept the fact that what you said was true, then he's a fool.", "NTA.\n\nWhat. In. The. Fuck?\n\nI'm sitting here with my mouth hanging open, unable to believe your husband said that to you.\n\nPay him back? Owe him? Allowance? \n\nNo. Just no. You either need counseling for this marriage or a divorce lawyer because all of that is out of line.\n\nSo NTA.\n\nAnd congrats on your new career!", "You raise his children, which is a 24/7 job especially with two toddlers, because he can\u2019t be bothered and YOU OWE HIM? If you divorced  his ass and split custody he would actually need to pull his weight.", "NTA. Always curious about people who buy \"bling\" ... how much savings and investments do you two have? You chose a real loser who is not a man, but a rotten child. Keep your own money in a separate account, he'll rob you blind.", "I do and he has never ever asked me to be frugal or complained if I spent money before. First time this ever was mentioned or a thing. I was both shocked and livid.", "NTA, while he is making his tally of what you owe, you need your do yours\u2026 housekeeper, cook, cleaner, nanny, gardener, his ironing/laundry etc\u2026.

NTA!!", "This is the reason I was married to my ex for 5 years. Once I had my own income I realized I no longer depended on him and didn't have to put up with the bs anymore.", "Just because something is unpaid for, or free, don't not mean it's not valuable. Stay-at-home moms stay at home and take care of the house, cooking, cleaning, raising the kids, etc. Do men think none of those things have value? If a man wanted to replace a wife, he would need to hire a surrogate to give birth to a kid (or kids), which would be at least $200k per kid once everything is said and done. Then you need a nanny for the kids - and childcare isn't cheap. Then you need a maid to clean the house, a cook to prepare meals for you and the kid(s), and of course you'd need some 'adult fun' occasionally. Do they think paying for all that is cheaper than a wife? Or do men think that women should do all of this out of love when most wouldn't do the same. \n\nOh wait, it's only when a *woman* does it that it's valueless. If a *man* does it, well, that's a different story. It's strange that that doesn't apply when a woman does a man's job though...", "Don't call her dumb. That's not helpful.

Being a stay at home mum,  especially when you liked yoir previous job is incredibly difficult. It can be very isolating and carries a huge burden to be \"on\" all the time.
