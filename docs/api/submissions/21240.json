There is nothing \u201cout of touch\u201d about letting children have dyed hair that makes them enjoy their self-image more. You are also not entitled simply for having kids go to private school. Enrolling children in school is a complicated matter and ultimately each parent has total autonomy in deciding which school will be better for the children. You are not an AH for allowing your kids to dye their hair meanwhile your cousin is an AH, not for keeping her kids hair \u201cnormal\u201d or anything about their appearance, but for fighting with you because she can\u2019t respect your decisions with your own children even though they pose no harm to anyone.", "NTA I\u2019m glad you\u2019re letting kid\u2019s express themselves, having to wear uniforms at school can feel quite confining.

Your cousin is clearly jealous of your success, and her children are probably jealous of your children's freedom to make personal choices.  Your cousin is entitled to raise her children within her boundaries, she is not entitled to impose those boundaries upon your children.  Your grandma and aunt are the ones out of touch with the real world.  As far as socialization goes, your children a probably the celebrities of their peer group.  After all, they get to wear their hair in cool colors.  Limit your children's time with all of these individuals - they will not help your family.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI get the impression that your family is\n\n> out of touch in the real world and just live in a bubble\n\nThere's obvious resentment regarding your ability to send your kids to a private school. \n\nIt's a shame they can't just enjoy the family reunion without letting jealousy raise its ugly, green head.", "NTA  They are forced to conformed during the school year by the strict dress code.

They  started this rule because we couldn't have crazy hair colors in school and this way we could express ourselves in our free time. Plus it means when us kids are older we know how to safely dye our hair and how to take care of it and maintain it. So OP really you're even teaching your kids good life skills early.", "i'd say NTA. you fight the battle every damn morning during the school year probably about the uniform, and the kids dont get to show any originality or individuality at all at school throughout the year.

If you think they're getting a better education at private school and can afford to send them there, more power to you.  Your family doesn't get to excoriate you and call you names because of you school choice.  \n\nSecond, whether or not their school has a strict dress code, you get to decide how much freedom your kids have in the way they dress and groom themselves.  (Obviously, if you send them to a school with a strict dress code, you don't have the freedom to let the defy the code during the school year.)  But your relatives don't get to judge you for a parenting decision that is none of their business.\n\nYour extended family behaved very badly.

If your kids are being ostracized, then I\u2019d reconsider.", "NTA. Let the kids be kids and explore who they are now.  When your cousins kids turn 18, escape her house, dye their hair blue and get face tattoos - you will be able to tell her how glad you are that your kids got their \"weirdo\" phase out of the way when they were kids.", "NTA.  It's your family that the real world has passed by.  Good for you for letting the kids have some freedom.", "They both sound desperately jealous of your family's lifestyle.", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand parents who try to control everyone around them because they can\u2019t figure out how to set rules for their kids. It kinda sounds like your cousin had it out for you from the beginning tho and would have found something to pick at regardless of how your children looked. She also probably would have had a problem with your kids looking that way even if you didn\u2019t have (presumably) more money than them. The whole thing reeks of jealousy.

This was total crap then and is now, let them be kids and congrats on that! \nMy mother still has fits when I color the grands hair\u2026 WITH moms permission for summer fun. \n\nGo live your life. They are toxic and ridiculous!", "LOL your cousin is a real peach to try and gaslight you.  It's obvious she's the lousy parent - she's going to be the type that blames everyone else for what her children do or don't do.  Plus she's the one who set the \"bad example\" for her kids by being rude and disrespectful to her cousin and her children - teaching them if you don't like someone because they are different, it's okay to pick a fight and criticize them.  NTA  Good call on leaving, thus teaching your children they don't have to tolerate toxic people - even if their family.  None of it has/had anything to do with money, she obviously jealous of you for that too.  Good luck!", "Sounds like grandma and aunt are the ones living in a bubble; the world is changing, their outdated views of what is and isn\u2019t acceptable do not matter. \n\nYou\u2019re doing a great job mama, keep it up! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nNTA", "NTA I\u2019d say your cousin must be my mother but all her children are adults.

They\u2019re just kids expressing themselves. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business what they do with their hair", "NTA.  There are some public school's like my kid's that require uniforms.  You can bet I let him dress how he wants as long as it's weather/situation appropriate when he isn't in school", "NTA.  Dressing like weirdo's?  I mean, wtf are they wearing?  I can't imagine they're wearing anything that odd to warrant this much push back.  You're allowing your kids to express themselves in any way they'd like.  As long as their clothing isn't offensive, I don't see the problem.", "NTA. It sounds like your cousin is mad because her kids think she's too strict compared to you. For some people It's easier to fuss about other people's parenting than fix the problems in their own parenting."]}
