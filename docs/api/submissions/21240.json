Besides the fact that your family is crazy and you did nothing wrong\u2026 giving children the opportunity to express themselves is a great way to build self-confidence, Why would you send your children to such a strict environment for schooling? \n\nIf you want your kids to have a good education, but also want them to have free self expression, why do you find it acceptable for them to be in an environment where they cannot express themselves day to day? \n\nIs this school teaching them to be leaders, how to properly question their own beliefs, teaching them to be curious and explore knowledge, how to think freely, how to learn, and broaden their horizons through self motivation?

There is a strong need by authoritarian types to disrespect freedom of expression and creativity.  If you will wear your hair an unusual shade, perhaps you will not accept 'your place' in society.
