You're allowing your kids to learn about bodily autonomy. They're allowed to make choices about their own bodies, as long as they're safe.

Does the family have too much time on their hands or do they actually care?", "The mother of one of my friends once asked my mom why she allowed me to wear teal blue nail polish once. Like it was the worst thing in the world. It was the 90s so I was also a bit grunge as well, she always side eyed me for that as well. My mom told her that it wasn\u2019t like I was in prison or doing drugs, so who cares what I\u2019m wearing.", "How is her cousing \"gaslighting\" her in expressing a disagreeable opinion?", "It's totally baffling when you run into people like this. Some people really seem to think that every aspect of a kid's life needs to be policed or they will turn into some kind of amoral monster. Or perhaps even more bafflingly, they really believe that something about wearing teal nail polish signifies that you are a bad person. My own dad would never let me get my ears pierced or dye my hair, and if you asked him why, all he could say was \"only bad people do that\". That's not a reason!!"]}
