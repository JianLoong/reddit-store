{"id": 30474, "submission_id": "17pjys5", "title": "AITA for backing out of making my sister-in-laws wedding dress?", "selftext": "I 24f am a seamstress/dress designer who works for private clients on commission.  Two years ago my sister got married and as my gift to her I designed and made her wedding dress free of charge and all her bridesmaid dresses at cost of raw materials.\n\nMy brothers then girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e) was part of the wedding party and knew I was doing this. Before I even started designing, she asked me if for her and my brother's wedding would I make her dress? I casually agreed.  When actually making the gowns my sister and her other 5 bridesmaids were so nice and pleasant to work with, but my brother's girlfriend was a nightmare. She kept asking me to make changes after we finalized the designs and I had already started making the dresses. She would cancel and just not show up to fittings, she complained constantly of how it looked tacky and unprofessional. And she even ripped the fabric on purpose when I told her I could not make any more changes, and I had to go on a wild goose chase to get more of the same fabric in the right color (the place I bought it from no longer carried it.)\n\nMy brother proposed two weeks ago and the first thing my new sister-in-law did was come over to me and ask when we could meet to start designing. Now at this point in my career I have dealt with my fair share of bridezillas and control freaks, and I know how to handle them.  So, I let her know a time she could come to my studio for a consultation.\n\nLast week was her appointment and she came in all excited, but when I brought out my pricings and options for her, she got really mad saying it wasn't fair to expect her to pay when we were family, and I had given other family theirs for free. I told her nicely that I charge for my work as would any other vendor she got for her wedding and that we can look at the most affordable package I have if she was concerned about cost.\n\nAt this she totally lost it screaming at me that I'm a worthless bitch whose work isn't even good enough for her and that she was doing me a favor by letting me have this opportunity. I tried to calm her down so we could talk but she just got worse, knocking over one of my display cases and shattering glass, beads, and expensive jewelry all over the floor.  At that point I was done and yelled at her to get out of my studio before I called the cops.\n\nLater that day my brother called me and yelled at me for being so disgusting and unwelcoming to his Fianc\u00e9e, I explained to him that I am more than happy to make her gown, and her bridesmaids' gowns, at a fair price.  But he got even more upset and said that I had done our sisters for free so I should do this one for free too.\n\nNow my parents and brother are mad at me, threatening to leave me out of the wedding if I don't make her a free dress but I still think I should be paid for my work.

You have the right to choose when you want to comp a wedding dress and bridesmaids dresses, and when you don't. You've already seen what a bridesmaidZilla you're soon to be SIL has been in the past, and now in the present.  I would present her with an itemized bill for the damages she did to the glass case and any of the jewelry that was damaged in the process. I would tell her she needs to pay this to you before you even discuss letting her pay for you to create a dress for her. If you decided to bless her with a wedding dress, I would tell her it's only for the wedding dress and not the bridesmaids. I would write up a contract, stating exactly how many changes she's allowed to make and what the budget is exactly for this one dress. Set a deliverable date, and that's what she gets.  You may want to have a sketch of maybe three choices she can make for a dress from you. It will be on her if she decides to rip it or pitch a tantrum to get another change after you she agreed in writing to only so many changes.  I would have a deliberate damage clause in there as well that says if she rips it to try and force you to make changes, then she owes you for the dress in full.   But I think she's going to be a handful with every encounter you have with her. How's your brother tolerating her at all?  And why isn't your family rallying around you for the tantrum and property damage she did at your shop?

On top of everything else, you set a boundary and she firmly crossed it. She crossed it during your sisters wedding and she crossed it in your studio.

You couldn't pay me to go to the wedding after that (much less design and make a dress for it) unless there was a VERY sincere apology as well as adequate compensation for the damage she caused. Like seriously, WTF? Who thinks it is OK to verbally abuse someone like that and then damage property?? Property destruction like that literally constitutes domestic violence, especially when paired with screaming and name-calling. I am so hurt for you thar your family is not appalled by her behavior. Please do not give in or she/ the rest of the family will abuse and manipulate you every time they want something. Unreal! I'm so sorry this happened to you!!", "NTA. Use her words against her.

But I am curious as to why you made a dress as a gift for your sister but wouldn\u2019t do the same for your future SIL, (essentially a gift for your brother) Is it just because she\u2019s a nightmare to work with, and don\u2019t get me wrong.

Two years ago my sister got married and as my gift to her I designed and made her wedding dress free of charge and all her bridesmaid dresses at cost of raw materials.\n\nMy brothers then girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e) was part of the wedding party and knew I was doing this. Before I even started designing, she asked me if for her and my brother's wedding would I make her dress? I casually agreed.  When actually making the gowns my sister and her other 5 bridesmaids were so nice and pleasant to work with, but my brother's girlfriend was a nightmare. She kept asking me to make changes after we finalized the designs and I had already started making the dresses. She would cancel and just not show up to fittings, she complained constantly of how it looked tacky and unprofessional. And she even ripped the fabric on purpose when I told her I could not make any more changes, and I had to go on a wild goose chase to get more of the same fabric in the right color (the place I bought it from no longer carried it.) \n\nMy brother proposed two weeks ago and the first thing my new sister-in-law did was come over to me and ask when we could meet to start designing. Now at this point in my career I have dealt with my fair share of bridezillas and control freaks, and I know how to handle them.  So, I let her know a time she could come to my studio for a consultation. \n\n Last week was her appointment and she came in all excited, but when I brought out my pricings and options for her, she got really mad saying it wasn't fair to expect her to pay when we were family, and I had given other family theirs for free. I told her nicely that I charge for my work as would any other vendor she got for her wedding and that we can look at the most affordable package I have if she was concerned about cost. \n\nAt this she totally lost it screaming at me that I'm a worthless bitch whose work isn't even good enough for her and that she was doing me a favor by letting me have this opportunity. I tried to calm her down so we could talk but she just got worse, knocking over one of my display cases and shattering glass, beads, and expensive jewelry all over the floor.  At that point I was done and yelled at her to get out of my studio before I called the cops.\n\nLater that day my brother called me and yelled at me for being so disgusting and unwelcoming to his Fianc\u00e9e, I explained to him that I am more than happy to make her gown, and her bridesmaids' gowns, at a fair price.  But he got even more upset and said that I had done our sisters for free so I should do this one for free too. \n\nNow my parents and brother are mad at me, threatening to leave me out of the wedding if I don't make her a free dress but I still think I should be paid for my work. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.

Let your family know that SIL doesn't even like your work! She made this clear at your sister's wedding & again at her consultation. Why would she choose u if she doesn't like your work (I'm sure she's lying) ?? Is it bc she'd anticipated saving $$ on dresses? As if there's no difference between a sister & brand new sil? Also who gives a shit about an invite to their wedding honestly? Divorce rates are at what, 50%? She sounds awful & there's a good chance this won't be your brother's only wedding. Wait until when/if they procreate!", "NTA. I find it suspicious that so many people a) are skilled at making wedding outfits for their family and b) have so much trouble establishing normal boundaries to preserve their dignity in expressing that skill. \n\nThat aside, have you tried telling your brother and family what you've told us? Her behavior sounds completely unhinged, and the fact your family doesn't recognize that is **so unreasonable as to be unbelievable**. She's destroyed your property, badmouthed your work, and insulted you personally, *on multiple occasions*. She knows she's marrying into your family right? Assuming they do get married, she'll be seeing you at holidays, other weddings, birthdays, kids' events, etc. How would she have the audacity to look you in the eye at those events?\n\nWhat's truly shocking is your admission that you are **still** willing to work for her \"at a fair price.\" Look inside yourself, OP. Do you value your self-respect so low that some muff cabbage calling you a \"worthless bitch\" wouldn't echo in your head in every stitch you make? Come on.

She needs to find another seamstress.", "NTA, this is one of the reasons I don\u2019t do work for any family members (I\u2019m a software engineer) when they ask  (usually \u201cmillionaire\u201d app ideas \ud83e\udd23) I just say I don\u2019t have time, that I work a 80 hour/week job (not true lol) and that I can find recommendations for them.\n\nBtw, your SIL is just a spoiled brat.", "INFO: have you actually told your family that the GF was unpleasant to work with, before? If not, there are a million things that they could be assuming and Y T A. \n\nIf so, NTA.", "Devil's advocate: if you gifted some of your siblings something but not the other, does that seem equitable? I can see how your brother thought you'd make something for his wedding since you'd done it for your other siblings. I get that the fiancee isn't your sister and all, and her behavior is inexcusable, but the basic premise that they'd think you'd do for them what you've done for others isn't that much of a reach. \n\nNTA, but the core misunderstanding is...well, understandable to some degree.", "NTA\n\nSounds like a win win being left out of the wedding.\n\nHold your ground.", "NTA and press charges for her breaking the display case. She wants to go nuclear then go nuclear.\n\nOkay, if you don't want to go that way I would explalin you casually said fine to making her dress at the BEGINNING of your last sister's wedding and then tell her, your brother, and the rest of your family everything you said here. The fact your sister already broke a display case shows she is NOT someone you should be working with and I'd point out \"the dress I made for SIL as a bridesmaid did not seem up to her standards so I don't feel like I could actually make a gown she'd truly be happy with.\" Just leave out the fact that your SIL won't be happy with anything because she's a giant walking BRAT!", "What the ****. Does your brother know that she destroyed your studio? That's so weird he would make the family turn against you after she committed a criminal offense of damaging your property. She sounds unhinged. Hopefully you got some photos. \n\nDo you even want to go to a wedding of a crazy person that destroyed your property because they didn't like what they heard? \n\nAlso I get their point IF you were making your brother's tuxe because that's your immediate family and so was your sister. Like are you even close to your sister inlaw? \n\nWow I'm still in shock that she damaged your property over this. Honestly I'd press charges LOL call me petty but to turn your family against you. I hope they don't know what she did because this is just bizarre to be upset for asking for money and being okay that someone again DAMAGED YOUR PROPERTY over this. She could of calmly come back with your brother if she didn't like it and had another discussion as to why. \n\nIf you do end up doing her dress... maybe write up a contract saying if she misses a fitting, ripps up fabric, insults you, or what ever else you wanted. Than you will stop making the dress, give her what you have done and she can go else where to finish it. And if you want to be nice you can give her what money you didn't use back. \n\nBut seriously this lady sounds unhinged and in need of mental help.", "NTA. After what happened the first time around I\u2019m baffled anyone would expect you to still make her dress for free. She cost you _and_ the bride extra time, worries, and money. As for her recent deplorable behavior, anyone else would have left in the back of a police cruiser. She should be thankful your immediate reaction wasn\u2019t calling the cops, let alone anyone else inside the business. I fully believe she lied through her teeth about what actually happened to everyone.", "NTA. Don\u2019t go to the wedding. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have another one", "NTA, making you work for free isn't doing you any favor. Also, your work is not up to her standards and yet she has asked you twice to make her dress and then causes a shitstorm when you told her she was going to pay. If your work wasn't good enough for her, why would she wear a wedding gown she thinks is ugly even if it's free? \n\nHowever, you would be an AH to your self for even considering to still make a wedding dress for her, whether paid or not, after what she has done to you and what she has said to you. Some family members aren't worth your time. \n\nAlso, if you haven't done so, tell your brother and your parents about her terrible behavior when you were making her a bridesmaid dress and during your consultation. How she yelled and insulted you and intentionally damaging your materials when she wasn't getting her way. Tell them she's lucky you aren't pressing charges for destruction of property.", "NTA. FSIL is a nightmare. Don\u2019t cave to her and your family, and get her to pay you back for damages, even if you have to press charges.\n\nPeople like her will take and demand the sun moon and stars if you let them. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about 1 dress. This is about how you will be treated for the rest of your life. \n\nShe will want you to make every prom dress, hem every pair of pants, sew every Halloween costume, alter every gown no matter how intensive\u2026 for free, or at your personal cost. \n\nNip this in the bud.", "NTA.  I hope you took pictures of the damage she did in your studio and please share it with your brother and parents.", "NTA. If you're good at something, never do it for free. I'm an illustrator and a maker. I've had family try to pull the \"family\" card on me before and my answer is always the same: I don't give a shit who you are.

She could get married at the courthouse, during the arraignment.", "NTA ask you brother who's paying for the damaged display stand.", "I don\u2019t understand why you would agree to work with her for any price. Just be honest that she\u2019s difficult and awful and you refuse to deal with it!", "\"a worthless bitch whose work isn't even good enough for her\"\n\nFunny how she still wants that free dress.", "NTA. do they even know the truth of how she was when she came in, that she trashed the place? Doesn\u2019t really sound like a wedding you would actually be missing out on at the end of the day.", "NTA but you could have handled things better. You should have told your brother 2 years ago that his fiancee behaved poorly during dress fittings. Gently, but sort of like a heads up. You also should have told her you expect to be paid before inviting her over to discuss options. The fact that she expected a free dress is not surprising. Also, you kind of agreed to that 2 years ago, when she asked if you would do her dress as well and you said yes. What did you think she was asking for?As your future SIL, she expects you to treat her equally to your actual sister. That is not unreasonable and I guess it's why your brother and parents are upset. Had they known beforehand about her rude behaviour they might have had another opinion now.\n\nHave you finally told your brother about her behaviour two years ago and how it upset you? Or dies he still not know? If not, from his point of view, his fiance asked you for a dress, you agreed and now for no reason you are declining the favour in a rude way, by asking to be paid and basically treating her like NOT family.", "INFO: did you ever tell her directly that you would be charging? i.e. before the studio consultation", "Why didn't you tell her you would charge her for the dress BEFORE her appointment? You knew what her expectation were, and you knew you didn't want to do it for free, yet you willingly invited her to your studio. Seems like you set this up and wanted to hurt her feelings.", "gahhhhdddd. i come from a large family & im constantly invited to weddings of people i dont even know. my mom is always upset that i dont go \ud83d\ude02 \n\nUNINVITE ME, PLS.", "Right.   There is no amount of money that would induce me to make a dress for this woman.  She was the bridesmaid from hell that u/Any-Comment9509 tolerated for the sake of family connection and now she wants to repeat the performance.\n\nOP should tell her parents exactly why she will not make anything for the future SIL recounting everything she has here.   Her sister witnessed her previous performance and should back her up.\n\nShe might want to tell her parents that they should be concerned about their son marrying such an unreasonable person.", "I would absolutely include that she ripped fabric on purpose last time you worked with her, so they know that these costly temper tantrums are a habit and that is why you aren't doing this at cost.", "Yeah, I don't understand why more people aren't talking about that. She grew up with her sister. That is HER family, and her brother's fianc\u00e9 isn't in the circle yet.

The other is not.", "Crikey?", "In the UK we have a charity shop that is very famous here called Oxfam. The larger stores have an entire bridal section. We got wedding and bridesmaids dresses for \u00a3200.", "Sister is her twin, who invested and supported her business. If brother wanted her to make him a suit, sure. But dresses are alot more and she doesn't have to give free labor. Brother is not FSIL. Two seperate people.", "Absolutely agreed with you on FSIL's behaviour here. Hence the ESH. But, as I said, FSIL's culpability in this scenario, while admittedly much higher than OPs, doesn't absolve OP of her behaviour, which in my view was avoidant at best and manipulative at worst.", "I disagree. Nobody is excusing the way the fiancee acted. But it's Naive to the extreme to think that OP did nothing wrong here. She knew the clear expectations were that the dress would be free. She scheduled an appointment to have her brother's fiancee come to her studio and then immediately hit her with pricing. Like /u/UrbanDryad there were a lot of other ways to handle this that didn't waste the fiancees time, that didn't allow the fiancee (after asking OP to design the dress) to have the expectation of getting a free dress. \n\nOP achieved the end goal that she wanted which was not designing the dress. She fully anticipated the Fiancee to be pissed off and not want to pay her for the dress so she didn't have to make the dress. She was not anticipating the Fiancee to (very wrongly) destroy the display though. \n\nIf OP had simply come up with a simple neutral excuse like not having the time because she already has a lot of work commitments. Or even having an upfront and frank conversation with both the brother and the fiancee about how things didn't go 100% smoothly while making the bridesmaids' dresses so they need to lay out some very clear expectations on timelines, what it means when the dress is finalized and the importance of making it to all the fittings things very likely would have gone very differently.", "You shouldn't make anything for SIL at all, not for any price.  She showed you who she was during your sister's wedding and escalate to the point of vandalizing your shop.  Drop the rope and tell everyone you refuse to work with her.   Then let them figure out how much enabling they want to do.", "You can tell them that \u2018family doesn\u2019t threaten and coerce either\u2019 Nor cause damages and violence- send them a video of what she did if you have cameras. \nYou could say- I made Sis\u2019s gown and bridesmaids in xx time. For SILs dress alone it was 20 changes, ripped fabric and verbal abuse I put up with. My mental health won\u2019t let me do this to myself again. SIL didn\u2019t like what I said and was physically violent and caused damages in my store. I feel threatened and blackmailed and am disappointed that my family can stand by and watch me getting verbally abused and physically threatened and still want me to put my health and well-being aside.", "NTA. And stop offering to make the wedding dresses at price. It is not a good idea. This will turn into an even worse nightmare if they agree. Their demands will skyrocket and you most likely will not see a penny of the money you\u2019re owed.
