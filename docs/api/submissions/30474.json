Two years ago my sister got married and as my gift to her I designed and made her wedding dress free of charge and all her bridesmaid dresses at cost of raw materials.\n\nMy brothers then girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e) was part of the wedding party and knew I was doing this. Before I even started designing, she asked me if for her and my brother's wedding would I make her dress? I casually agreed.  When actually making the gowns my sister and her other 5 bridesmaids were so nice and pleasant to work with, but my brother's girlfriend was a nightmare. She kept asking me to make changes after we finalized the designs and I had already started making the dresses. She would cancel and just not show up to fittings, she complained constantly of how it looked tacky and unprofessional. And she even ripped the fabric on purpose when I told her I could not make any more changes, and I had to go on a wild goose chase to get more of the same fabric in the right color (the place I bought it from no longer carried it.)\n\nMy brother proposed two weeks ago and the first thing my new sister-in-law did was come over to me and ask when we could meet to start designing. Now at this point in my career I have dealt with my fair share of bridezillas and control freaks, and I know how to handle them.  So, I let her know a time she could come to my studio for a consultation.\n\nLast week was her appointment and she came in all excited, but when I brought out my pricings and options for her, she got really mad saying it wasn't fair to expect her to pay when we were family, and I had given other family theirs for free. I told her nicely that I charge for my work as would any other vendor she got for her wedding and that we can look at the most affordable package I have if she was concerned about cost.\n\nAt this she totally lost it screaming at me that I'm a worthless bitch whose work isn't even good enough for her and that she was doing me a favor by letting me have this opportunity. I tried to calm her down so we could talk but she just got worse, knocking over one of my display cases and shattering glass, beads, and expensive jewelry all over the floor.  At that point I was done and yelled at her to get out of my studio before I called the cops.\n\nLater that day my brother called me and yelled at me for being so disgusting and unwelcoming to his Fianc\u00e9e, I explained to him that I am more than happy to make her gown, and her bridesmaids' gowns, at a fair price.  But he got even more upset and said that I had done our sisters for free so I should do this one for free too.\n\nNow my parents and brother are mad at me, threatening to leave me out of the wedding if I don't make her a free dress but I still think I should be paid for my work.

You have the right to choose when you want to comp a wedding dress and bridesmaids dresses, and when you don't.

If you decided to bless her with a wedding dress, I would tell her it's only for the wedding dress and not the bridesmaids. I would write up a contract, stating exactly how many changes she's allowed to make and what the budget is exactly for this one dress. Set a deliverable date, and that's what she gets.  You may want to have a sketch of maybe three choices she can make for a dress from you. It will be on her if she decides to rip it or pitch a tantrum to get another change after you she agreed in writing to only so many changes.  I would have a deliberate damage clause in there as well that says if she rips it to try and force you to make changes, then she owes you for the dress in full.   But I think she's going to be a handful with every encounter you have with her. How's your brother tolerating her at all?

You couldn't pay me to go to the wedding after that (much less design and make a dress for it) unless there was a VERY sincere apology as well as adequate compensation for the damage she caused.

Property destruction like that literally constitutes domestic violence, especially when paired with screaming and name-calling. I am so hurt for you thar your family is not appalled by her behavior.

Two years ago my sister got married and as my gift to her I designed and made her wedding dress free of charge and all her bridesmaid dresses at cost of raw materials.\n\nMy brothers then girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e) was part of the wedding party and knew I was doing this. Before I even started designing, she asked me if for her and my brother's wedding would I make her dress? I casually agreed.  When actually making the gowns my sister and her other 5 bridesmaids were so nice and pleasant to work with, but my brother's girlfriend was a nightmare. She kept asking me to make changes after we finalized the designs and I had already started making the dresses. She would cancel and just not show up to fittings, she complained constantly of how it looked tacky and unprofessional. And she even ripped the fabric on purpose when I told her I could not make any more changes, and I had to go on a wild goose chase to get more of the same fabric in the right color (the place I bought it from no longer carried it.) \n\nMy brother proposed two weeks ago and the first thing my new sister-in-law did was come over to me and ask when we could meet to start designing. Now at this point in my career I have dealt with my fair share of bridezillas and control freaks, and I know how to handle them.  So, I let her know a time she could come to my studio for a consultation. \n\n Last week was her appointment and she came in all excited, but when I brought out my pricings and options for her, she got really mad saying it wasn't fair to expect her to pay when we were family, and I had given other family theirs for free. I told her nicely that I charge for my work as would any other vendor she got for her wedding and that we can look at the most affordable package I have if she was concerned about cost. \n\nAt this she totally lost it screaming at me that I'm a worthless bitch whose work isn't even good enough for her and that she was doing me a favor by letting me have this opportunity. I tried to calm her down so we could talk but she just got worse, knocking over one of my display cases and shattering glass, beads, and expensive jewelry all over the floor.  At that point I was done and yelled at her to get out of my studio before I called the cops.\n\nLater that day my brother called me and yelled at me for being so disgusting and unwelcoming to his Fianc\u00e9e, I explained to him that I am more than happy to make her gown, and her bridesmaids' gowns, at a fair price.  But he got even more upset and said that I had done our sisters for free so I should do this one for free too. \n\nNow my parents and brother are mad at me, threatening to leave me out of the wedding if I don't make her a free dress but I still think I should be paid for my work. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.

Also who gives a shit about an invite to their wedding honestly? Divorce rates are at what, 50%? She sounds awful & there's a good chance this won't be your brother's only wedding. Wait until when/if they procreate!", "NTA. I find it suspicious that so many people a) are skilled at making wedding outfits for their family and b) have so much trouble establishing normal boundaries to preserve their dignity in expressing that skill. \n\nThat aside, have you tried telling your brother and family what you've told us? Her behavior sounds completely unhinged, and the fact your family doesn't recognize that is **so unreasonable as to be unbelievable**. She's destroyed your property, badmouthed your work, and insulted you personally, *on multiple occasions*. She knows she's marrying into your family right? Assuming they do get married, she'll be seeing you at holidays, other weddings, birthdays, kids' events, etc. How would she have the audacity to look you in the eye at those events?\n\nWhat's truly shocking is your admission that you are **still** willing to work for her \"at a fair price.\" Look inside yourself, OP. Do you value your self-respect so low that some muff cabbage calling you a \"worthless bitch\" wouldn't echo in your head in every stitch you make? Come on.

She thought it was an envelope of cash at first.", "Not sure I would call it petty revenge. This feels like she's going nulcear.", "Or they could jump out of a fake wedding cake!", "Canadian. Definitely the C word. I'd also be demanding she pay for the damage done. This is also a great story for r/entitledpeople.", "I sooooo heart you for this. Thank you."]}
