Two years ago my sister got married and as my gift to her I designed and made her wedding dress free of charge and all her bridesmaid dresses at cost of raw materials.\n\nMy brothers then girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e) was part of the wedding party and knew I was doing this. Before I even started designing, she asked me if for her and my brother's wedding would I make her dress? I casually agreed.  When actually making the gowns my sister and her other 5 bridesmaids were so nice and pleasant to work with, but my brother's girlfriend was a nightmare. She kept asking me to make changes after we finalized the designs and I had already started making the dresses. She would cancel and just not show up to fittings, she complained constantly of how it looked tacky and unprofessional. And she even ripped the fabric on purpose when I told her I could not make any more changes, and I had to go on a wild goose chase to get more of the same fabric in the right color (the place I bought it from no longer carried it.)\n\nMy brother proposed two weeks ago and the first thing my new sister-in-law did was come over to me and ask when we could meet to start designing. Now at this point in my career I have dealt with my fair share of bridezillas and control freaks, and I know how to handle them.  So, I let her know a time she could come to my studio for a consultation.\n\nLast week was her appointment and she came in all excited, but when I brought out my pricings and options for her, she got really mad saying it wasn't fair to expect her to pay when we were family, and I had given other family theirs for free. I told her nicely that I charge for my work as would any other vendor she got for her wedding and that we can look at the most affordable package I have if she was concerned about cost.\n\nAt this she totally lost it screaming at me that I'm a worthless bitch whose work isn't even good enough for her and that she was doing me a favor by letting me have this opportunity. I tried to calm her down so we could talk but she just got worse, knocking over one of my display cases and shattering glass, beads, and expensive jewelry all over the floor.  At that point I was done and yelled at her to get out of my studio before I called the cops.\n\nLater that day my brother called me and yelled at me for being so disgusting and unwelcoming to his Fianc\u00e9e, I explained to him that I am more than happy to make her gown, and her bridesmaids' gowns, at a fair price.  But he got even more upset and said that I had done our sisters for free so I should do this one for free too.\n\nNow my parents and brother are mad at me, threatening to leave me out of the wedding if I don't make her a free dress but I still think I should be paid for my work.

If you decided to bless her with a wedding dress, I would tell her it's only for the wedding dress and not the bridesmaids. I would write up a contract, stating exactly how many changes she's allowed to make and what the budget is exactly for this one dress. Set a deliverable date, and that's what she gets.  You may want to have a sketch of maybe three choices she can make for a dress from you. It will be on her if she decides to rip it or pitch a tantrum to get another change after you she agreed in writing to only so many changes.  I would have a deliberate damage clause in there as well that says if she rips it to try and force you to make changes, then she owes you for the dress in full.   But I think she's going to be a handful with every encounter you have with her. How's your brother tolerating her at all?

Property destruction like that literally constitutes domestic violence, especially when paired with screaming and name-calling. I am so hurt for you thar your family is not appalled by her behavior.

Two years ago my sister got married and as my gift to her I designed and made her wedding dress free of charge and all her bridesmaid dresses at cost of raw materials.\n\nMy brothers then girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e) was part of the wedding party and knew I was doing this. Before I even started designing, she asked me if for her and my brother's wedding would I make her dress? I casually agreed.  When actually making the gowns my sister and her other 5 bridesmaids were so nice and pleasant to work with, but my brother's girlfriend was a nightmare. She kept asking me to make changes after we finalized the designs and I had already started making the dresses. She would cancel and just not show up to fittings, she complained constantly of how it looked tacky and unprofessional. And she even ripped the fabric on purpose when I told her I could not make any more changes, and I had to go on a wild goose chase to get more of the same fabric in the right color (the place I bought it from no longer carried it.) \n\nMy brother proposed two weeks ago and the first thing my new sister-in-law did was come over to me and ask when we could meet to start designing. Now at this point in my career I have dealt with my fair share of bridezillas and control freaks, and I know how to handle them.  So, I let her know a time she could come to my studio for a consultation. \n\n Last week was her appointment and she came in all excited, but when I brought out my pricings and options for her, she got really mad saying it wasn't fair to expect her to pay when we were family, and I had given other family theirs for free. I told her nicely that I charge for my work as would any other vendor she got for her wedding and that we can look at the most affordable package I have if she was concerned about cost. \n\nAt this she totally lost it screaming at me that I'm a worthless bitch whose work isn't even good enough for her and that she was doing me a favor by letting me have this opportunity. I tried to calm her down so we could talk but she just got worse, knocking over one of my display cases and shattering glass, beads, and expensive jewelry all over the floor.  At that point I was done and yelled at her to get out of my studio before I called the cops.\n\nLater that day my brother called me and yelled at me for being so disgusting and unwelcoming to his Fianc\u00e9e, I explained to him that I am more than happy to make her gown, and her bridesmaids' gowns, at a fair price.  But he got even more upset and said that I had done our sisters for free so I should do this one for free too. \n\nNow my parents and brother are mad at me, threatening to leave me out of the wedding if I don't make her a free dress but I still think I should be paid for my work. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA.

Why would she choose u if she doesn't like your work (I'm sure she's lying) ?? Is it bc she'd anticipated saving $$ on dresses? As if there's no difference between a sister & brand new sil? Also who gives a shit about an invite to their wedding honestly? Divorce rates are at what, 50%? She sounds awful & there's a good chance this won't be your brother's only wedding. Wait until when/if they procreate!", "NTA. I find it suspicious that so many people a) are skilled at making wedding outfits for their family and b) have so much trouble establishing normal boundaries to preserve their dignity in expressing that skill. \n\nThat aside, have you tried telling your brother and family what you've told us? Her behavior sounds completely unhinged, and the fact your family doesn't recognize that is **so unreasonable as to be unbelievable**. She's destroyed your property, badmouthed your work, and insulted you personally, *on multiple occasions*. She knows she's marrying into your family right? Assuming they do get married, she'll be seeing you at holidays, other weddings, birthdays, kids' events, etc. How would she have the audacity to look you in the eye at those events?\n\nWhat's truly shocking is your admission that you are **still** willing to work for her \"at a fair price.\" Look inside yourself, OP. Do you value your self-respect so low that some muff cabbage calling you a \"worthless bitch\" wouldn't echo in your head in every stitch you make? Come on.

The op should book a nice holiday for herself over the wedding day and, if anyone asks why she isn't going, she must tell the whole story about this AH and her equally AH brother and parents.", "Absolutely.

You should be compensated for your work. What you did for your sister is beyond generous but is no precedent for any other relatives. \n\nAll the other petty things people are saying, just don\u2019t. Reddit is full of teenagers who doing know how life works and \u201cserving her at her own wedding haha\u201d will create more conflict and damage within your family with no reward.", "This is my favorite answer!!!", ">she is not deserving of anything from you.\n\nExcept for criminal charges.", "But sister should equal brother. I'm sorry for her brother, who must have felt left out his whole childhood already.", "I'm pretty sure that ai wrote this one", "OP's beef isn't that the FSIL thought she would make the dress for free, it is how she reacted when she said she wouldn't. \n\nIt is an incredibly entitled behavior to **demand** something for free simply because the person gave someone else a similar item for free years ago. And it is completely unacceptable to destroy property about hearing the news it won't be free. \n\nOP isn't obligated to do any of her work for free, ever.", "I am extremely close with my sister; we are twins and when I was starting out with my studio, she helped me out so much. I love her and wanted to give her a specialized one-of-a-kind gift, and since dressmaking is what I'm good at that is what I decided to give her.\n\nI didn't want to do my SIL's for free because it is a very expensive gift, from materials to labour it costs a lot. I do not feel like we are close enough for me to do this for her. It is thousands of dollars in materials, and potentially hundreds of hours of construction. Not to mention the time that could have been used on other potential commissions, my workers wages, and her potential to be a bridezilla and make my work life miserable", "Same brother and SIL. The dress SIL was previously a nightmare about was her bridesmaid's dress for someone else's wedding.", ">. I also don't think everyone would be jumping on the bandwagon if FSIL hadn't vandalized OPs studio.\n\n\n\nBut she did. \n\nIf you ask Op to do better, what about her? \n\nAlso, $$$ being asked could be Op's way of trying to either get her to use someone else or get her to behave. This bride needs one of the 2.", "Yeah, the context in which she originally agreed to make the dress would clearly make any reasonable person to think it would also be a gift.  For OP to not mention that that was no longer the case until the consultation is quite an AH move.", "OP is willing to work with nightmare clients as she explained in the post. She works with nightmare clients. I don't see how OP is an AH for choosing to work with nightmare clients. She just expects to be paid for her work with nightmare clients.", "In no way is her SIL treating OP like family. Throwing tantrums and mistreating her like she no doubt does to all service workers.", "If SIL believes the dress will be free, how is not talking about pricing until the consultation (which is standard practice) vs. a few days earlier when he asked for the consult an AH move? How exactly was SIL harmed by that?", "Ps. I'm very sorry you are going trough this! You are handeling it very well", "Just tell him you\u2019ll probably be able to make it to his wedding to wife #2.", "It's not for free, it's for an opportunity! The SIL is gracious enough to give OP free exposure on her wedding day! Of course, that exposure is mainly to other family members who should obviously get it for free as well, but it's an opportunity!", "I think you meant *me and my wallet", "I like mine with beans", "\ud83d\udcaf", "I remember when my Australian b-i-l would call a headache a quarter, because his head was pounding, ... Quarter pounder ... Quarter.", "Fellow Aussie here and I love that you got so many countries to unite on the future SIL being a C word!!", "Oh, I love seeing this.  My dress was a bit more than yours, $300, but was just a nice comfy dress.  Flowers and the cake from Costco (their cakes are delicious and I arranged the flowers myself), potluck and about 70 people in a friend\u2019s house.  Most of our friends are musicians so it was a big jam session later.  Best day ever!", "For the bridesmaid dress, after getting the casual agreement. She didn't even get to talking about her wedding dress before exploding and hopefully getting charges from op, display cases can be a pain to replace, not to mention clean up and any lost items.\n\n  I wouldn't work with fsil without an asshole tax tagged on to all the other payments she'd have to pay just like any other client. And probably not even then because she's already a nightmare.", "Its clear there was a misunderstanding in that when the future SIL asked \"will you do this for me too\", she meant \"will you make me a free dress too\", while OP meant \"i'd be happy to be who you hire\". \n\nSo SIL thinks that OP is going back on a deal that OP made, when in reality OP never meant to make that deal. \n\nHad SIL not thrown a tantrum here and started destroying property there'd be a lot of room for talking things over and finding a middle ground. OP could offer a discounted rate that'd cover the cost of materials and still compensate her for her time, a 'family discount' maybe. But not anymore.", "Oh it is also very shitty behavior to be only the bridesmaid and thinking your dress and your opinion is more important than the dress and the opinion of the bride who is the sister of your boyfriend. And to behave like shit to the other sister of the boyfriend just because she does what her sister the bride wants. Just because fsil thought she had the rights to get a dress for free doesn\u2019t mean she should get one for free. That audacity is beyond. She is marring in this family and has already showed 2 sisters that she thinks she is better than them.\n\nNTA and dont make the dress, even paid. And if possible talk alone to brother, show him footage and extra costs because of her behavior and if necessary tell him that you love him but don\u2019t want to do that even with not being invited and that you will be there for him if he later wanted to talk or have a relationship again.", "If you haven't already that how you should explain it to your parents. You gave your sister the wedding dress because you're really close and because she helped you start your business. Also add exactly how much it would cost to do SIL wedding dress. You could also add that you just can't afford to do it free.\n\nEither way NTA", "Shut your delusional brother up, and possibly excise your SIL from your family for good, by simply telling her, \"If my brother really loved you, he'd pay for the most luxurious tier of my services for you. He used to pamper his ex all the time like this.\"", "Exactly. She's shown who she is, and that was a bridesmaid dress. Imagine what she'd be like with 'the dress of a lifetime.'", "Had SIL known that there would even be a pricing discussion, it\u2019s likely the consultation would not have taken place at all.  Regardless of SILs subsequent behavior, OP did in fact lead SIL to believe that the dress would be a gift.", "Better put an /s there for clarity.", "My sister said this to our father once.  He was one of the most anti-kid person alive.  He didn't even like us when we were young (but really enjoyed us as adults).  I remember he just looked at her and walked out of the room.  Grandpa of the year he wasn't.  People who spout this nonsense need to know their audience.  Lol", "It sounds more like a summons rather than an invite if you ask me. As a way of putting up appearances. If anything, OP should just chill at home and avoid all the drama that entitled sil is making. And ask her to pay for damages too. Plus put sil on blast too to other dressmakers or fashion designers so that shes blacklisted from their services", ">She can\u2019t destroy your shit in a tanty and think you will let [it] slide.\n\nGood verbiage. r/quoteoutofcontext", "Agreed. She\u2019s a huge C", "I think at the point SIL asked if OP would make her future wedding dress, at that point in time OP would have been willing to consider making her dress for free like she did for other family. \n\nBut then SIL started acting like an entitled asshole over the bridesmaid dress and OP realised she wouldn't want to go through that again (or worse) for the future wedding dress. \n\nSo when SIL eventually wants a wedding dress, OP decides to charge because it's not worth the hassle doing it for free. I don't even think it's worth it to OP to do it paid, SIL is probably going to be a nightmare to design for.", "The question was \"would you do this as a wedding gift for us?\" The wedding gift part implies free, especially as OP just did it for free as a wedding gift for someone else.", "Just because someone believes, even reasonably, that something will be free does not mean you are an AH for not providing it for free. \n\nYou are never obligated to provide something free to someone unless you **explicitly** told them it would be free.

SIL did not come to OP because of OPs portfolio but only because SIL thought OP was providing a gift.  OP should have made it clear much earlier that this was not the case.", "Other revenge idea: If she\u2019s not part of the wedding party, but still going; OP should design and create her own outfit. Not one to upstage the bride of course, but one that\u2019s awesome enough to get into conversation that she made it herself.
