End of story. Even if he were an experienced and licensed driver. Letting someone drive your car is only ever a privilege to be granted, to show the utmost trust. No matter how close or are or how high your trust level, you could only ever *expect* someone to let you drive their car in an absolute 911 emergency.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s never done, you just never expect it if someone else. A lot of people would have laughed in his face at the prospect of driving their car.", "NTA and you had me at \"till he passed the driving test\"", "NTA.  Safety trumps feelings.", "NAH. Since his foreign license means it is legal for him to drive in your country, can't you start letting him \"practice\" with you in less-travelled areas? Similar to a parent letting their kid get hours in behind the wheel? Wouldn't he need to do that anyway in order to pass a driving test?", "NTA, it\u2019s a safety concern. You would also most likely (depending on your country\u2019s liability laws and your particular car insurance) be financially on the hook if he were to wreck your car.\n\nMy BF and I very rarely drive each others\u2019 vehicles, and we are both listed on each others\u2019 insurance policies as allowed drivers. We just prefer not to as we\u2019re not used to driving the others car regularly.", "NTA. Is he even insured? I mean, if he drives your car and crashes it, does he have insurance that covers the cost of the damages?", "NTA. I don\u2019t let properly licensed folks behind the wheel of my new car. It is literally the first ever brand new car I have purchased, and if anybody\u2019s going to mess it up, it\u2019s going to be me.", "NTA. You can say no to letting anyone driving your car for any reason you want. If your BF respected you he would respect your wishes about this.", "OP you are doing the right thing so NTA. Safety comes first", "NTA. Congrats on your purchase. Your boyfriend can wait until he passes his license. Don\u2019t risk safety for his vanity", "You are NTA, and you probably deserve someone better. Leave this loser on whichever side of the road you prefer.", "How is he supposed to practice?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He clearly needs more practice and to demonstrate that by passing the local driving test.", "You're NTA for so many reasons here.\n\nCars are a personal item, unless the family buys it as a family vehicle.  He's given you reason to not trust him and it's clear he needs more practice, which shouldn't be done in a brand-new vehicle.  It sounds to me like he views your car as a toy and wants to play with it which is ample reason not to let him drive it at all.", "NAH. I'm from a country that drives on the opposite side from the US. I'm licensed to drive in both countries. I still sometimes forget, but instinctively correct my mistake to avoid accidents. Let him drive within your neighbourhood, BUT ensure he's also on the insurance. That's so he can get comfortable switching his brain from left/right when driving.", "NAH\n\nHe has a fully legal licence, but you don't have to let him drive your car. He can be hurt about it, as longas he doesn't pressure you.", "NTA. And a foreign licence is only valid for a specific time. He needs to pass the test where you are before he gets access to your vehicle.", "To be clear, he has a full licence. Just not from my country.", "Not in a brand new car. With friends or paying for lessons", "In a driving school with a licensed instructor and a car with double pedals.", "Wait until you drive an RHD in the LHD country you are from.", "I know but as you mentioned it is from a country where he drives on the other side and you have seen first hand him struggling with it.", "A full license from another country where they drive differently means nothing here. It only takes a minute of confusion to cause an accident.", "In a lot of countries, a foreign licence is only valid for residents for a set period--often 6 months or a year from the start of residency--until it has to be exchanged for a local licence. Unless your bf's licence is fully transferable to your country like eg if it's an EU licence within the EU, it's possible that just having a foreign licence may not be enough. Remember that insurance companies will use literally any reason they can to not pay out if the worst happens.", "NTA. Was going to say Y T A when you said he already has another valid license.\n\nAs it isn't that difficult to adjust as the driving seat changes with the side of the road. Getting wiper and turn signal lever mixed up is normal and just takes an hour or so to get used to.\n\nBut driving onto oncoming shows he requires additional training before he is trusted to drive safely.", "NTA , so I\u2019m from a country where you drive on the left but , I\u2019m also from a country that has a old saying , you should not borrow your car , house or woman to another if you don\u2019t want to break them, trust me it makes sense in my language but the point is, it\u2019s not the trust that is missing, you just both the car, it\u2019s going to cost you money to fix it if it gets broken, if you made an effort to buy it put some value on it not waste it on people that are going to get sad that they can\u2019t drive you car that you\u2019re paying for", "NTA OP.  I wouldn\u2019t even WANT to drive in another country until I was able to pass their licensing requirements.", "NTA\n\nIf his licence is legal in your country, he can go practice in cars that are NOT your nice new car. A few lessons with a driving instructor will likely really help him adapt.", "It is great you had provided that info, it at least explains why he's butt hurt. \nNTA. It is your car. He has driving problems. \n\nTo be clear:\nWould he be willing to pay for an insurence that gives you full refund, even if it is his fault when the car gets totalled ?  \nIf he does, you would STILL be NTA for not wanting him to drive."]}
