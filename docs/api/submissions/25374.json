He's a gross  human being.", "A wet newspaper.", "Also my vet bills. I've had to take my dog to the vets 4 times in the past year due to pulled muscles and suspected IVDD. He pulled his neck muscle playing tug of war with my husband, once adjusting himself on my lap and another doing zoomies in the garden and skidding in the wet grass.", "Some of the highlights my dad has done that I reminded him of  -\n\nWhen my sis and I were young, we lost our house key so took the keys for the backdoor which also had the shed key on it. He came home from work early and wanted something from the shed. As soon as we walked in the door he smacked us across the head causing us to hit our heads on the wall.\n\nWhen I was about 10, he shouted at me for not knowing how to use a knife and fork properly. I was never shown by either parent.\n\nWhen I was 10, he made me stand on my grandmother's scales and screamed at me because of my weight calling me all the insults. I've had a bad relationship with food ever since.\n\nI was headbutted in the face when I was 16 and called the Police. My dad told me \"it serves you right for standing around street corners like a little prostitute\". I was walking home from the gym.\n\nWhen I was 18 and legally allowed to drink, I was getting ready to go out for a friend's bday. He wasn't happy about it, threw the open bottle of prosecco I was given for my bday that I had a glass of with my sister to celebrate finishing my exams and told me \"I hope you get r***d or something\"\n\nWhen I was staying at my ex's place to write an essay for uni, I was asked to collect something for my sis. I explained I had deadlines and that both he ans BIL drove so could then not get it instead. When I came home later that weekend, I was screamed and and called all the names under the sun causing me to have a panic attack.\n\nMy ex was in the military and was serving in Afghan during a particularly bad time. He wanted my ex to tell him all the stuff he got up to when visiting on R&R  but my ex didn't want to talk about it. When my ex returned to Afghan, my dad complained and I told him he needed to respect my ex's wishes. He fell out with me and told me he hoped my ex gets unalived.", "I tried to the moment he went to sulk in the bedroom. I'd just given birth and they were meant to be staying to help look after me. I told my mum I'd get my husband to drive him to the airport and book him on thr first flight home but was guilt tripped by my mum not to because if he went then she'd have to go too.\n\nI had already booked my mum's weekend so had to bite my tongue for the sake of my mum.\n\nHe stopped speaking to me between January and April  because I told him to stop mollycoddling my niece who was 21 and came to stay with me for a week. Despite having a high risk pregnancy, he expected me to travel into Central London and basically walk her onto the train with no regards for my health and told me I was a bad host. I'd shown her the day before which train to get and how to get to her platform but that wasn't good enough apparently and so I had to take the morning off work.", "I also asked him not to put his beer cans on my windowsill and he kept doing it as I was worried he would spill his beer over my expensive sofa.\n\nI have a corner sofa and he kept wedging himself in the corner and putting his bare feet on it like a chaise lounge despite having a footstool he could've used. \n\nBefore my FIL and MIL came round, I asked him to sit on the sofa properly so that my inlaws could sit. He told me he wouldn't be doing it but I thought he was joking. When my inlaws arrived, he kept his feet on the sofa so my inlaws had to sit either side of him and they looked visibly uncomfortable. Our parents have met maybe 5 times in total including the wedding and so I was mortified.\n\nWhen I bought a property with my ex, my dad starting doing DIY to my house without asking permission. My ex told him to stop and he told my ex the house was half mine therefore half his. I told him as he never contributed to the deposit or paid the mortgage then I don't know where he got that from. (He sulked in the guest bedroom for 2 days on that occasion too and told me I disrespected him)\n\nMy inlaws bought my husband his first property and gifted him money after they sold another property which allowed us to buy our house. They have never come into my home and behaved this way.", "LO = little one (baby)", "LO = little one", "Absolutely", "Good grief!

You are 100% right - dogs should NEVER be grabbed by the collar. This isn't a way to correct behavior, this is frightening, and a dog is more likely to bite out of fear or pain and become MORE reactive if they are treated this way. \n\nAlso, \"alpha\" isn't a thing - in people, OR for dogs.
