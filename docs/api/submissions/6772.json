Both work full time, comparable hours, but I cook all the meals while we otherwise split the housework 50/50. Wife doesn\u2019t cook because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to\u201d, but every time I offer to teach her or ask for help, she\u2019ll come up with excuses like being tired. Been this way coming on 20 years.\n\nToday I turned 40 and my wife\u2019s \u201cpresent\u201d was making me breakfast in bed. This consisted of toast, two eggs and a strip of bacon. Also an instant coffee (we have an actual coffee machine that does cappuccinos etc but wife doesn\u2019t know how to use it). I don\u2019t normally think of presents as transactional but I was really disappointed as it\u2019s something I do for her literally everyday of the year, and for my birthday she just put in minimal effort to make a standard breakfast. Turns out she had our daughter cook the bacon and eggs for her as well anyway, she only actually made the coffee.\n\nTold my wife it was a little disappointing as cooking for me occasionally is something she should be doing normally anyway. She took this really badly and isn\u2019t speaking to me atm and said she put a lot of thought into it since I\u2019m always asking her to learn to cook. For comparison, on her last birthday I surprised her by flying her sisters down to spend it with her, alongside a nice pair of earrings.\n\nMaybe I am being a bit selfish/childish for complaining about a present, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673144629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106734o/aita_for_not_thanking_my_wife_for_my_bed_in/", "score": 667, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think she could have possibly done less than make instant coffee and have your daughter do the cooking.\n\nOf course she's going to get all upset when you point out her gift was literally the least one partner could do for another. \n\nThis is the kind of thing that happens when you wake up on your husband's birthday and realize you forgot all about it and can't be arsed to go out and buy a card, cake or the simplest of gifts.", "Yeah NTA. She\u2019s been weaponizing incompetence for twenty years and she wants praise for making someone else cook a mediocre breakfast? I can\u2019t even choke down instant coffee.

Buy you a thing you wanted?", ">Wife doesn\u2019t cook because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to\u201d\n\nNope. Unless she has a physical or mental disability, she can cook, it's absurd someone over 40 years old can't cook, just absurd. It's like if she couldn't dress herself.\n\nI think her gesture is fine, and you saying you were disappointed by it kind of lame. The fact that she called it a \"present\" is kind of shit if you do this for her all the time as a thankless task.\n\n>said she put a lot of thought into it \n\nI'm leaning towards mental disability here. How much thought does toast, bacon and eggs need?\n\nI'm going NTA, I think maybe you could have been the bigger person (your wife sure as fuck isn't going to) but really this is a bigger issue that your wife simply will not take on her share of a very basic household task.\n\nIt sounds to me like your wife just needs to adult up a bit and realise that she doesn't get to just hold her hands up and say she can't do something. At this age, if you can't do something, you *fucking learn*.", "NTA-she didn\u2019t even make it.", "NTA. It sounds like she\u2019s been weaponizing her incompetence, so that you can cook, and understandably, you\u2019re frustrated. I was teetering between NTA and ESH because it\u2019s been 20 years, and it sounds like you\u2019ve built on resentment and haven\u2019t nipped this in the butt. You need to communicate and lay your foot down.\n\nHowever, it does sound like she\u2019s putting minimal effort, and you need to tell her how you feel. If she\u2019s still being apathetic, I would say probably don\u2019t go all out for her birthday, but also sounds like you guys could use couples counseling.", "NTA though I'm intrigued by the imbalance in gift giving.  Is it always that off?  Is she struggling right now?", "NTA, you should be able to voice your thoughts and she is old enough to handle it like an adult. Counseling!", "NTA.  She says she put a lot of thought into this but all she did was make instant coffee.  It would be completely different if she\u2019d taken a cooking class or asked your daughter to teach her how to make you breakfast but she didn\u2019t.  She had your daughter do all the work so she could take credit.  Sounds to me like she couldn\u2019t figure out what to get you or forgot so this is something she did last minute.", "INFO\n\nDid you express what you wanted for your birthday and she just ignored it?", "I mean, she didn\u2019t even cook the meal\u2026sounds like your daughter did!

But you need to split the cooking 50/50 or she doesn't eat what you make.", "NTA.\n\nShe kind of attempted but it was really bad.  Having your kid make it?  Really???  \n\nAs others have said - weaponized incompetence.  Breakfast is one of the EASIEST meals to make, yeesh.   Toast in a toaster, scramble a few eggs and fry some bacon, heck you can make bacon in the oven.  If your daughter can do it, she can too.  \n\nI'd recommend cooking lessons for your wife.  She should be able to learn some basics.  Even if she's bad at it, I would have preferred an attempt that is bad toward half-ass faking it like she did.    Or having your daughter coach her how to do everything.\n\nShe showed that she didn't even care enough to try to do it herself.  Or even begin to learn.", "NTA. That's a lazy gift if ever I've seen one.", "NTA- is this your 40th birthday too? That\u2019s usually one to celebrate.", "NTA.\n\nIf a woman had posted this, people would be losing their minds about men doing the bare minimum and calling it a job well done. Nothing changes based on gender. She didn\u2019t even cook herself, she still made someone else do it for her. Literally the laziest option she could have chosen.", "NTA - I'm really having a hard time here. On the one hand, you took what was a nice gesture and used it to criticize your wife instead. I'm also not a big fan of comparing couples gifts because it's not a competition, it's an expression of thoughtfulness. \n\nThis was thoughtful, but I think your complaints are valid. I'd feel differently if she had actually done the cooking, but having your daughter do it means she couldn't even be bothered to learn some of the most basic cooking. It doesn't feel like a special treat when it's something you do for her every day. She felt like her gesture is being taken for granted, but that's how you feel every day that she refuses to share the cooking responsibilities.", "ESH\n\nI hate reading about people whining when another person make some sort of attempt to be kind. It's like just eat your fucking breakfast and shut up.\n\nI doubt anyone was holding a gun to your head when you decided to pay for plane tickets and jewelry. \n\nOn the flip side your Wife is lazy as fuck. There's no such thing as not being able to cook or cannot learn how to cook. Assholes make these excuses so they don't have to bother cooking.\n\nYes, cooking can be as much of an art as anything else, but at the bare minimum it just involves you following instructions, you don't have to get wild with it. \n\nAny time someone tells me they can't cook, my response is always, \"What? You can't follow simple instructions?\".", "Your wife sounds like a real spoiled, manipulative Bi***. Sorry for that. NTA!", "I've never understood what's so cool about breakfast in bed.\n\nDo people really want to eat and drink in bed? I've never done it or wanted to, but it seems like it would be uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I wake up, I want to stand up, move, stretch, go to the bathroom, start the day.\n\nEven if it's a lazy day, I want to take my coffee out to the porch or even sit at the kitchen table with the TV on, not try to eat bacon and eggs in bed on a wobbly tray.\n\nWhen I've been with people in the hospital who had to eat in bed on a special table made for that purpose, they're always twisting around and acting like it's difficult to eat sitting up with their legs stretched out in front of them.\n\nWhat am I not getting? What's fun about breakfast in bed?\n\nAlso, OP is NTA, but I was always taught if someone gives you a shitty gift, say thank you and move on.", "INFO: what was the timeline here? Like did you say a thank you when she first walked in with it and then express disappointment later in the day, or did you immediately jump to disappointment?", "ESH. You allowed this pattern to happen over the course of 20 years now. Why are you surprised that she is 41 and can\u2019t cook? \n\nThis is not a \u201cone time off\u201d and she gave a poor gift. You\u2019ve enabled this behavior for decades.", "ESH.\n\nShe sucks because she tried to pass off your daughter\u2019s work as her own. That\u2019s not okay, and it takes away from daughters sense of accomplishment.\n\nYou suck for the comment about how this is what she \u201cshould be doing everyday\u201d. It doesn\u2019t always work out the woman cooks everyday; schedule, skill level, or preference are all valid factors for many couples.", "I'd be upset if that's all my bf did, but we go big for birthdays. Either way, I'd think it was a nice gesture and be very surprised and happy upon seeing it, so YTA for not even thanking her immediately when she came in. You didn't know all these details about instant coffee and daughter making it. You're taking those into account now to validate yourself. \n\nI'm assuming this has something other to do than breakfast in bed.", "ESH, I can't help but to wonder that if the roles were reversed and if your wife did the majority of the cooking, would you be bothered at all by the fact that she did most of the cooking? Is it only an issue because you do most of the cooking? Whoever is the better cook and/or whoever enjoys cooking more, tends to do most of the cooking in the household. That is just how it goes. Your wife probably just does not enjoy cooking. If you don't want to cook as much, then start bringing your daughters into the kitchen and teaching them to start cooking some meals for themselves. Let your wife know that you will start cooking significantly less meals since everyone is a bit older in the household, so unless she plans on ordering takeout, she should be sitting right next your daughters when you start giving lessons. \n\nIn regard to the gift, I also wouldn't consider breakfast in bed a \"birthday gift\", I would consider that a random romantic gesture, or just a show of appreciation that you should be doing for your spouse once in a while. I would express my appreciation for her efforts, but after so many years, I would expect my spouse to know the standard that we have set for \"gift-giving\" in our relationship. I agree with other commenters that you shouldn't be comparing price tags when it comes to gifts, but you should be attempting to put in the same amount of thought, or consideration, into a gift that you give to someone.", "ESH\n\nYeah she could have done better. But people still say \"thanks\" even for a small present to be polite.", "YTA \n\nCooking isn\u2019t something she normally does so she went out of her way to do it to show she cares, you took it as a negative because you think this is an area she lacks in and should contribute more in.\n\nYou didn\u2019t see it for the sweet gesture it was meant as because you were focused on existing resentment.", "YTA for the \u201cshe should do this everyday\u201d comment but it\u2019s understandable to be upset you didn\u2019t get much for your birthday. It seems like you have a lot of resentment about her not cooking for you that should definitely be discussed.", "\u201cBed in breakfast\u201d \n\nI was so confused by your title because at first I thought this was going to be about some Bed and Breakfast establishment and I thought you had no idea how to spell it.\n\nMan, you should just come out and say it. You don\u2019t appreciate shit. You don\u2019t even appreciate the effort. She and your daughter both did something special for you, and you don\u2019t even care about that. It\u2019s not the effort that counts to you apparently. It\u2019s that she\u2019s not a great chef and doesn\u2019t cook for you 365 days a year.\n\nWhy have you been with someone for 20 years if this was such a problem? Did you come to the internet expecting validation to make her sound like the bad guy to make yourself feel better?\n\nWell, *I\u2019m so sorry*, but you\u2019re probably not going to get that here.\n\nShe\u2019s not the asshole, you are. How about you start working on patching things up with your wife instead of complaining about it on Reddit.\n\nYTA.", "ESH  \nYour wife can't cook or even make coffee and this is how she chooses to celebrate your birthday. If she can't do these things then she should have done something else like get the workout gear you asked for. She did breakfast because she forgot and pulled this at the last second. \n\nThis is where you are an AH. You mentioned in comments she was raised to have everything done for her. And you did the same, allowing her weaponized incompetence to continue. There is a whole lot of resentment in the \"she should be doing this every day\" comment and you guys have bigger issues to deal with than this breakfast.", "ESH - neither of you have communicated well. \n\nIt would be helpful if you both detatch from this isolated incident. I would ask yourselves whether or not you are both appreciating enough. Is she appreciating what you do for her? Would you be less upset if everytime she got her coffee she was very appreciative?\n\nDoes she do things for you that are not cooking? Have you given her appreciation for that? Does she know that you see the effort she puts into that. \n\nWhat she should be doing is not just saying \"thank you\". Appreciation is more than that. It's \"this coffee is so nice, I really cherish mornings with you\" and \"I feel treated like royalty when you make the coffee with the machine, I know it's not a super big deal but I appreciate how much better the coffee is\" and \"how did you make the coffee so xyz? it's great! I really like how you do xyz, can you show me how?\"\n\nYou should be doing the same thing for the things she does for you.\n\nNow returning to this isoalted incident, would you have reacted in the same way if you didn't have existing resentment? Probably not. Ok so cooking isn't her skill set but you got a breakfast in bed and a coffee, it's not like she was trying to give you a royal banquet. You could have been polite and recognised that it was meant to be a small sweet gesture. You've also completely removed your daughter from this situation. You wife and daughter worked together to give you a treat on your birthday, why does it bother you so much that your wife didn't put in the particular kind of effort you wanted? Because you have existing resentment, is my best guess.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The bar has been set. A cup of instant coffee is a perfectly reasonable birthday gift according to the wife. \n\nHopefully her daughter also makes her bacon and eggs.", "You would make a terrible life partner", "Because that's not a gift. \nIt's about showing love to your spouse.\nShe showed him that she doesn't want to put any effort in to make her husband happy on his 40th birthday.\nThat's f-ed up.", "Except for the fact that almost everyone agrees that he is in no way an asshole", "She\u2019s 41. Why should he have to teach her how to use a coffee machine, instead of her just taking 5-10 minutes to figure it out herself?", "One of my favorites is:\n\nThe bar was on the ground and you brought a shovel. \n\nI think the limbo with the devil became my new favorite though lol", "I hadn't heard that one, but I like it!", "Because W can't use the coffee machine!"]}
