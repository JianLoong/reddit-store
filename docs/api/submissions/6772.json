Both work full time, comparable hours, but I cook all the meals while we otherwise split the housework 50/50. Wife doesn\u2019t cook because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to\u201d, but every time I offer to teach her or ask for help, she\u2019ll come up with excuses like being tired. Been this way coming on 20 years.\n\nToday I turned 40 and my wife\u2019s \u201cpresent\u201d was making me breakfast in bed. This consisted of toast, two eggs and a strip of bacon. Also an instant coffee (we have an actual coffee machine that does cappuccinos etc but wife doesn\u2019t know how to use it). I don\u2019t normally think of presents as transactional but I was really disappointed as it\u2019s something I do for her literally everyday of the year, and for my birthday she just put in minimal effort to make a standard breakfast. Turns out she had our daughter cook the bacon and eggs for her as well anyway, she only actually made the coffee.\n\nTold my wife it was a little disappointing as cooking for me occasionally is something she should be doing normally anyway. She took this really badly and isn\u2019t speaking to me atm and said she put a lot of thought into it since I\u2019m always asking her to learn to cook. For comparison, on her last birthday I surprised her by flying her sisters down to spend it with her, alongside a nice pair of earrings.\n\nMaybe I am being a bit selfish/childish for complaining about a present, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673144629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106734o/aita_for_not_thanking_my_wife_for_my_bed_in/", "score": 225, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think she could have possibly done less than make instant coffee and have your daughter do the cooking.\n\nOf course she's going to get all upset when you point out her gift was literally the least one partner could do for another. \n\nThis is the kind of thing that happens when you wake up on your husband's birthday and realize you forgot all about it and can't be arsed to go out and buy a card, cake or the simplest of gifts.", "Yeah NTA. She\u2019s been weaponizing incompetence for twenty years and she wants praise for making someone else cook a mediocre breakfast? I can\u2019t even choke down instant coffee.

Buy you a thing you wanted?", ">Wife doesn\u2019t cook because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to\u201d\n\nNope. Unless she has a physical or mental disability, she can cook, it's absurd someone over 40 years old can't cook, just absurd. It's like if she couldn't dress herself.\n\nI think her gesture is fine, and you saying you were disappointed by it kind of lame. The fact that she called it a \"present\" is kind of shit if you do this for her all the time as a thankless task.\n\n>said she put a lot of thought into it \n\nI'm leaning towards mental disability here. How much thought does toast, bacon and eggs need?\n\nI'm going NTA, I think maybe you could have been the bigger person (your wife sure as fuck isn't going to) but really this is a bigger issue that your wife simply will not take on her share of a very basic household task.\n\nIt sounds to me like your wife just needs to adult up a bit and realise that she doesn't get to just hold her hands up and say she can't do something. At this age, if you can't do something, you *fucking learn*.", "NTA-she didn\u2019t even make it.", "NTA. It sounds like she\u2019s been weaponizing her incompetence, so that you can cook, and understandably, you\u2019re frustrated. I was teetering between NTA and ESH because it\u2019s been 20 years, and it sounds like you\u2019ve built on resentment and haven\u2019t nipped this in the butt. You need to communicate and lay your foot down.\n\nHowever, it does sound like she\u2019s putting minimal effort, and you need to tell her how you feel. If she\u2019s still being apathetic, I would say probably don\u2019t go all out for her birthday, but also sounds like you guys could use couples counseling.", "NTA though I'm intrigued by the imbalance in gift giving.  Is it always that off?  Is she struggling right now?", "NTA, you should be able to voice your thoughts and she is old enough to handle it like an adult. Counseling!", "NTA.  She says she put a lot of thought into this but all she did was make instant coffee.  It would be completely different if she\u2019d taken a cooking class or asked your daughter to teach her how to make you breakfast but she didn\u2019t.  She had your daughter do all the work so she could take credit.  Sounds to me like she couldn\u2019t figure out what to get you or forgot so this is something she did last minute.", "INFO\n\nDid you express what you wanted for your birthday and she just ignored it?", "I mean, she didn\u2019t even cook the meal\u2026sounds like your daughter did!

But you need to split the cooking 50/50 or she doesn't eat what you make.", "NTA.\n\nShe kind of attempted but it was really bad.  Having your kid make it?  Really???  \n\nAs others have said - weaponized incompetence.  Breakfast is one of the EASIEST meals to make, yeesh.   Toast in a toaster, scramble a few eggs and fry some bacon, heck you can make bacon in the oven.  If your daughter can do it, she can too.  \n\nI'd recommend cooking lessons for your wife.  She should be able to learn some basics.  Even if she's bad at it, I would have preferred an attempt that is bad toward half-ass faking it like she did.    Or having your daughter coach her how to do everything.\n\nShe showed that she didn't even care enough to try to do it herself.  Or even begin to learn.", "NTA. That's a lazy gift if ever I've seen one.", "NTA- is this your 40th birthday too? That\u2019s usually one to celebrate.", "NTA.\n\nIf a woman had posted this, people would be losing their minds about men doing the bare minimum and calling it a job well done. Nothing changes based on gender. She didn\u2019t even cook herself, she still made someone else do it for her. Literally the laziest option she could have chosen.", "NTA - I'm really having a hard time here. On the one hand, you took what was a nice gesture and used it to criticize your wife instead. I'm also not a big fan of comparing couples gifts because it's not a competition, it's an expression of thoughtfulness. \n\nThis was thoughtful, but I think your complaints are valid. I'd feel differently if she had actually done the cooking, but having your daughter do it means she couldn't even be bothered to learn some of the most basic cooking. It doesn't feel like a special treat when it's something you do for her every day. She felt like her gesture is being taken for granted, but that's how you feel every day that she refuses to share the cooking responsibilities.", "ESH\n\nI hate reading about people whining when another person make some sort of attempt to be kind. It's like just eat your fucking breakfast and shut up.\n\nI doubt anyone was holding a gun to your head when you decided to pay for plane tickets and jewelry. \n\nOn the flip side your Wife is lazy as fuck. There's no such thing as not being able to cook or cannot learn how to cook. Assholes make these excuses so they don't have to bother cooking.\n\nYes, cooking can be as much of an art as anything else, but at the bare minimum it just involves you following instructions, you don't have to get wild with it. \n\nAny time someone tells me they can't cook, my response is always, \"What? You can't follow simple instructions?\".", "Your wife sounds like a real spoiled, manipulative Bi***. Sorry for that. NTA!", "I've never understood what's so cool about breakfast in bed.\n\nDo people really want to eat and drink in bed? I've never done it or wanted to, but it seems like it would be uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I wake up, I want to stand up, move, stretch, go to the bathroom, start the day.\n\nEven if it's a lazy day, I want to take my coffee out to the porch or even sit at the kitchen table with the TV on, not try to eat bacon and eggs in bed on a wobbly tray.\n\nWhen I've been with people in the hospital who had to eat in bed on a special table made for that purpose, they're always twisting around and acting like it's difficult to eat sitting up with their legs stretched out in front of them.\n\nWhat am I not getting? What's fun about breakfast in bed?\n\nAlso, OP is NTA, but I was always taught if someone gives you a shitty gift, say thank you and move on.", "INFO: what was the timeline here? Like did you say a thank you when she first walked in with it and then express disappointment later in the day, or did you immediately jump to disappointment?", "ESH. You allowed this pattern to happen over the course of 20 years now. Why are you surprised that she is 41 and can\u2019t cook? \n\nThis is not a \u201cone time off\u201d and she gave a poor gift. You\u2019ve enabled this behavior for decades.", "ESH.\n\nShe sucks because she tried to pass off your daughter\u2019s work as her own. That\u2019s not okay, and it takes away from daughters sense of accomplishment.\n\nYou suck for the comment about how this is what she \u201cshould be doing everyday\u201d. It doesn\u2019t always work out the woman cooks everyday; schedule, skill level, or preference are all valid factors for many couples.", "I'd be upset if that's all my bf did, but we go big for birthdays. Either way, I'd think it was a nice gesture and be very surprised and happy upon seeing it, so YTA for not even thanking her immediately when she came in. You didn't know all these details about instant coffee and daughter making it. You're taking those into account now to validate yourself. \n\nI'm assuming this has something other to do than breakfast in bed.", "ESH, I can't help but to wonder that if the roles were reversed and if your wife did the majority of the cooking, would you be bothered at all by the fact that she did most of the cooking? Is it only an issue because you do most of the cooking? Whoever is the better cook and/or whoever enjoys cooking more, tends to do most of the cooking in the household. That is just how it goes. Your wife probably just does not enjoy cooking. If you don't want to cook as much, then start bringing your daughters into the kitchen and teaching them to start cooking some meals for themselves. Let your wife know that you will start cooking significantly less meals since everyone is a bit older in the household, so unless she plans on ordering takeout, she should be sitting right next your daughters when you start giving lessons. \n\nIn regard to the gift, I also wouldn't consider breakfast in bed a \"birthday gift\", I would consider that a random romantic gesture, or just a show of appreciation that you should be doing for your spouse once in a while. I would express my appreciation for her efforts, but after so many years, I would expect my spouse to know the standard that we have set for \"gift-giving\" in our relationship. I agree with other commenters that you shouldn't be comparing price tags when it comes to gifts, but you should be attempting to put in the same amount of thought, or consideration, into a gift that you give to someone.", "ESH\n\nYeah she could have done better. But people still say \"thanks\" even for a small present to be polite.", "YTA \n\nCooking isn\u2019t something she normally does so she went out of her way to do it to show she cares, you took it as a negative because you think this is an area she lacks in and should contribute more in.\n\nYou didn\u2019t see it for the sweet gesture it was meant as because you were focused on existing resentment.", "YTA for the \u201cshe should do this everyday\u201d comment but it\u2019s understandable to be upset you didn\u2019t get much for your birthday. It seems like you have a lot of resentment about her not cooking for you that should definitely be discussed.", "\u201cBed in breakfast\u201d \n\nI was so confused by your title because at first I thought this was going to be about some Bed and Breakfast establishment and I thought you had no idea how to spell it.\n\nMan, you should just come out and say it. You don\u2019t appreciate shit. You don\u2019t even appreciate the effort. She and your daughter both did something special for you, and you don\u2019t even care about that. It\u2019s not the effort that counts to you apparently. It\u2019s that she\u2019s not a great chef and doesn\u2019t cook for you 365 days a year.\n\nWhy have you been with someone for 20 years if this was such a problem? Did you come to the internet expecting validation to make her sound like the bad guy to make yourself feel better?\n\nWell, *I\u2019m so sorry*, but you\u2019re probably not going to get that here.\n\nShe\u2019s not the asshole, you are. How about you start working on patching things up with your wife instead of complaining about it on Reddit.\n\nYTA.", "ESH  \nYour wife can't cook or even make coffee and this is how she chooses to celebrate your birthday. If she can't do these things then she should have done something else like get the workout gear you asked for. She did breakfast because she forgot and pulled this at the last second. \n\nThis is where you are an AH. You mentioned in comments she was raised to have everything done for her. And you did the same, allowing her weaponized incompetence to continue. There is a whole lot of resentment in the \"she should be doing this every day\" comment and you guys have bigger issues to deal with than this breakfast.", "ESH - neither of you have communicated well. \n\nIt would be helpful if you both detatch from this isolated incident. I would ask yourselves whether or not you are both appreciating enough. Is she appreciating what you do for her? Would you be less upset if everytime she got her coffee she was very appreciative?\n\nDoes she do things for you that are not cooking? Have you given her appreciation for that? Does she know that you see the effort she puts into that. \n\nWhat he should be doing is not just saying \"thank you\". Appreciation is more than that. It's \"this coffee is so nice, I really cherish mornings with you\" and \"I feel treated like royalty when you make the coffee with the machine, I know it's not a super big deal but I appreciate how much better the coffee is\" and \"how did you make the coffee so xyz? it's great! I really like how you do xyz, can you show me how?\"\n\nYou should be doing the same thing for the things she does for you.\n\nNow returning to this isoalted incident, would you have reacted in the same way if you didn't have existing resentment? Probably not. Ok so cooking isn't her skill set but you got a breakfast in bed and a coffee, it's not like she was trying to give you a royal banquet. You could have been polite and recognised that it was meant to be a small sweet gesture. You've also completely removed your daughter from this situation. You wife and daughter worked together to give you a treat on your birthday, why does it bother you so much that your wife didn't put in the particular kind of effort you wanted? Because you have existing resentment, is my best guess.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she really really can't cook then either go pick something up or do a non breakfast birthday gift.\n\nIf you're going to do breakfast in bed as a 40th present then at least grill a fucking tomato and a bit of halloumi or something. Couple chipolatas. Most breakky food isn't expensive.", "NTA does she even care about you at all???", "NTA. She has managed 2 decades of weaponized incompetence. It\u2019s not particularly hard to figure out how to cook. If you can read, you can learn how to cook. Her barely assed to care breakfast in bed would not be a gift to me either.", "NTA\n\nThat is a bad present especially since all she did was make a bad cup of coffee and got your kids to do the rest.\nGoing forward for her breakfasts just tell her the cereal is in the cupboard and tell her she can learn how to make ramen thats easy enough for her dinner, she is using weaponised incompetence just like how some men do and you need to put your foot down and say that you are not enabling her any longer", "NTA and tell her what's really disappointing is that she wants credit for what your daughter did.", "NTA. I do not cook, and my husband has been the main provider for meals and groceries, etc., for over 20 years, as well. I do not know how to cook and I do not want to learn to cook and I do not make any excuses for it. My husband has always known this and we work it out. If my husband doesn\u2019t feel like cooking, I find a way to feed myself (and the kids before they were grown). For my husband\u2019s birthday, I usually do something not involving food, like go to a special event or something nice. If he wants food, I will buy a cake, and/or take him out to dinner or cater something in. The thing is that I surprise him with some things, but I also ask him what he wants and he tells me, and then I give it to him. So even though I don\u2019t think you are the asshole here because there was no other effort, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to let your wife know what you\u2019d like. And if she doesn\u2019t cook and probably never will, maybe any expectation of her cooking for you is setting yourself up for disappointment.", "NTA.\n\nAct as normal as possible. Talk to her even if she isn't talking to you (not about this topic). When she breaks her silent treatment ask her if she's ready to have a 2 way conversation. \n\nI would give lots of examples like if I had our daughter make you eggs, bacon, toast and i made you an instant cup of coffee to celebrate your 40th birthday how would you feel? And then when she makes excuses, keep bringing it back to that. \n\n\"When I plan a birthday celebration it is because I want you to have a wonderful day and to know that I love and appreciate you.\"\n\n\"I was disappointed that the only gift/celebration was a cup of instant coffee, in the future I would like at minimum a more personalized gift and a plan for the day of things I would enjoy.\"", "NTA - i think that calmly and nicely explaining the lack of effort compared to yours is justified. For your next birthday, i will get you a gift card for $20 for coffee... how would you feel? \n\nSometimes women forget that men like to feel special too. It was my husband's birthday yesterday, i went out and got him a cake, some flowers (yes for a man), a shrimp cocktail tray and a card to go with his present. He appreciated it all because it's the effort and thought i put into it. \n\nHappy birthday!", "Are your other chores divided equally considering only you cook?\nIf not stop cooking for her, only cook for ur self and kids and see her true colors", "I genuinely cannot even imagine \u2018giving\u2019 my husband such a pathetic excuse of a gift on his 40th birthday. With all due respect, it just doesn\u2019t sound like she likes you very much, and it\u2019s quite sad. \nNTA", "1st off your wife didn't actually cook the breakfast your daughter did so thank her for the gift. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. She only gave you one strip of bacon! She\u2019s TA just for that. Lol", "NTA.  Stop making her breakfast/lunch/dinner. Since it\u2019s obviously only for milestone birthdays.", "If you put in more effort everyday then your wife does for your birthday then your definitely NTA", "Your wife sucks and she should be embarrassed by her lack of effort; instead she\u2019s punishing you with silent treatment for having the audacity to voice disappointment. NTA", "I understand you being disappointed but she also did at least try to put in some effort and you should appreciate that a little.", "Also, it was his 40th birthday! Quite a day. You\u2019d think there should be some celebration and a special gift for a milestone. Nope. Kid cooks eggs and a strip of bacon and instant coffee it is. Way to reevaluate your life in bed with a tray on your lap. Happy birthday OP! Do something fun for yourself. At least you have a kind, self sufficient daughter.", "take my upvote", "yea", "A watch, an apron, a plan to go on vacation.. just anything besides hiding behind a child...", "She \"put a lot of thought\" into how to get their daughter to do the cooking for her; also what would be the easiest way to make coffee.", "this is one of the most well thought out, constructive, and helpful replies i\u2019ve read on this sub ever. this is extremely solid advice AND examples and if OP read and took them into account the problem would be significantly reduced. do you happen to be a couples counselor? the way you laid it out is just so clear and productive, A+ comment dude!", "Patch things up with the woman who went all out for his 40th birthday and made him a cup of instant coffee ?  Why ?  Because otherwise he won't even get that next year !", "My ex was exactly like this. I offered to help him so many times. He would sometimes chop things in the kitchen but refused to fry bacon or do the most basic tasks. I assume there's some sort of trauma but it was really weird", "What thought? She does absolutely nothing but a cup of instant coffee and gets the daughter to cook the rest. She's a lazy cow who needs to grow up and stop using crap excuses to do nothing. Stop cooking for her and she'll soon learn to cook or starve! Why do you women turn everything around and blame the men? NTA. Do yourself a favour, after 20 years gtfa. Life's too short to put up with this crap.", "There should have been at least three strips of bacon and fresh fruit.", "Happy Birthday!", "Childish. YTA. You are not owed anything for living another year like everyone else. Birthdays are extremely entitled and weird. Get over it and thank your wife. Maybe find out what the DEEPER issue is if she has a hard time cooking and using the coffee machine. But honestly SO WHAT!! I'm sure there are other things she does well for you all and I'm sure there are things you suck at.", "Haha oops", "Okay that is so wholesome your kid sounds awesome.", "If there would have been three strips of bacon, OP wouldn\u2019t have posted.", "This is fucking hilarious. Happy birthday OP! You deserved a lot more.", "Ummm... If she's ignoring his wants on his birthday, she's being an awful partner.", ">Don\u2019t look for excuses to always blame the man.\n\nDon't try to project whatever agenda you've got going onto my response. Go look at my actual vote.\n\nI said that if she had actually cooked the breakfast, I would've felt differently. I still think he would've had a legitimate complaint about getting something for his birthday that he does every day for her, and feeling taken for granted. But if she'd actually cooked the breakfast, it at least would've been a nod towards having listened to his complaint about her not cooking and trying to make an effort. But she didn't, so it's a moot point anyway.\n\nI hope someone thanked the daughter.", "Give it up", "Then let her!! Stop enabling her behaviour.. she either makes do with instant or she has to learn simple as", "Why is there instant coffee in the house?"]}
