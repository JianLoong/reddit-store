Hotels are mostly full non smoking at this point. Just keep saying no.  NTA.", "it just got worse from there. How can people be so entitled! NTA", "Definitely NTA, the whole list of demands is the icing on the turd cake. my personal bet is that they don't want to, or can't find, a smoking friendly hotel (hard and expensive) and/or pay for a hotel. And they're hoping that OP Will also help foot their food bill. \n\nThis is why I bought a small house. I have just enough room for myself, I don't have any spare rooms, if you really want to stay, there is a couch", "because you catch the most flies with a pile of turds", "\"We're staying with you, and we expect you to wait on us hand and foot.\" Get fucked. NTA!", "NTA Your house, your rules and it was very rude of them to invite themself as guest in your house", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything but correct his mis-assumption of being able to take advantage of you. No wonder one of his kids went military to escape that attitude.", "NTA \n\nNo is a complete sentence. If this is the hill he wants your relationship to die on then that's his call!", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s very rude for them to have invited themselves to stay at your house.", "NTA. Who thinks they can just stay at someone's house without asking first?", "NTA Do you know what makes them the AHs? Having people exert pressure on you instead of accepting your boundaries.", "NTA. Be wary of them showing up anyway.", "NTA - It\u2019s the dietary requirement email for me?! Even if your brother was dense enough to assume a \u201cdate/time\u201d notice meant his family could stay the week (which in and of itself is ridiculous) who sends a dietary requirement/menu order to family for an uninvited stay?!?! Not only did he expect you to put him and his family up .. for free\u2026 for a week\u2026 but he also expected you to buy and prepare their meals?!?!?!?", "I\u2019d be wary of family that picks sides, especially when they only need to hear one side of the story. He\u2019s got 16 years on you and his first plan of action is to bully you. With that information alone, I applaud and encourage every action you take to protect your family. The people who ask you to take it in the teeth would never do the same, as evidenced by the smoking and cursing.  NTA", "NTA, Gary and Leslie seem pretty trailer park trashy - imagine inviting yourself for a week and giving the dietary requirements so they can smoke and be a bad example for your girls.", "NTA Especially as they want to stay a week *and didn't even ask* before they started making demands. Love how they just expected you to finance their trip. \"Buy this food for us.\"  Yeah, that's part of hosting, but so is the inviting of guests and they skipped that part. You can skip all the rest.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t even ask you! He just announced it like he and his family are some sort of royalty! It\u2019s your home and your rules.", "NTA. Your roof, your rules. The level of entitlement is unbelievable.", "NTA", "So he just decided he was staying with you? With out asking? And then thought you would be paying for all the \"special\" food his kids needed?\n\nI would have said no too. Out of sheer principal. But then when you nice enough to consider it, you told him the house rules and he has the balls to get mad? Cause they can't smoke? \n\nAnd it's for a week! He wants to take up a week of your time to have you play host? With no warning, and seeming pay for his food? Hell no. \n\nYou should make sure to tell the family members that are calling that your brother decided to go stay with them for a week, they wil arrive tomorrow. They had better hit the store to get some food for them. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Guests follow the rules of the house or they are not guests.  Hotel. Hotel. Hotel.", "NTA. \n\nHow many of those family members that were mad offered to put him, his wife & kids up? I'm guessing none, since they know how he is and they are mad because they know they'll have to put up with him if you don't. Also, even if you are staying with family, it would be their responsibility to purchase/provide any special foods for their kids. I try to keep stuff on hand for guests and family, but if a guest has a dietary requirement I'm not sure on how to handle, they bring their own or I offer to go to the store with them and purchase it. \n\nI love how he just assumed he'd be at your place instead of actually asking. I'm kinda shocked he didn't just show up.", "Nope. NTA. Your house is your castle. They don't treat you or your house with respect. I can't imagine the nightmare of a week with spoiled entitled people. And it sounds like they expect you to be at their beck and call. A hotel is def in order!", "If they didn\u2019t ask you in advance they are beyond rude. NTA.", "Nta", "The demands about food and what they want for breakfast make it sound an awful lot like they want the hotel experience so should do just that", "Mad family can take them in for a week.    \n    \nNTA", "I live in my own place and refuse to smoke weed in it....its so easy to step outside"]}
