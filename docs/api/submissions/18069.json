My wife likes to celebrate her 23% Irish ancestry on Saint Paddy's day but is also otherwise American.

Thankfully my great grandfather predates Nazi Germany but still, kids can be jerks. More importantly, my last name is relatively big in my region as my grandfather held a relatively high (locally) political position and my father is a successful business owner.\n\nThat all being said, the 'issue' is that we're both only children and both are the metaphorical end of our lines. She has a very small family, my dad only has sisters. When we got legally married, my wife wanted to keep her maiden name. I said sure, you do you. We decided we'd talk about kids eventually.

My dad gave me some shit for it but I told him to kick rocks (in a joking way). Well our second child, a son, is on the way and my dad is starting to hound me again. He initially started with 'making a fifth!' and I shut that down real quick. That's not new, I've shut that idea down every time it's come up throughout my life.

While I don't \\*really\\* care, I can see why he's disappointed. I've thought about giving my son my last name as a middle name but he's not really satisfied with that...\n\nI spoke to my wife about it and while she doesn't really mind giving our son my last name, we both think it'd be weird for our two kids to have different last names.
