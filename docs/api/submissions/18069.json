I even offered my wife to keep her last name if she wanted to, and talked with her about \"here's why\". Names can be tough on school kids.", "NTA. Your fathers sisters could have kept and or passed on the last name.", "NTA. Not only is it your choice what to name your kid, and not your dad's, it's also a pain to have a person of the same name in the same household. I grew up with a dad and brother with the same first name and so did my husband, and it caused so many issues. When it came down to naming our son, we broke tradition and he has a name unique to himself. He is very glad of that.", "NTA. There are nearly 8 billion people on the planet. Someone somewhere has your last name.", "NTA. Tell your dad that his line is continuing genetically. That will have to be enough.", "I grew up with kids who two were given maiden name and two the father\u2019s name. Don\u2019t do this.

I think your father is being weird - he should think himself lucky to have a grandchild.", "NTA. Dad can get over himself.", "Nta", "My friends have alternated names with their two kids.  \n\nOne gets the top, one gets the bottom, they either agree on a middle name together, or they both get to choose one.  \n\nMaybe an idea for the next one?", "NTA and I am in a really similar position. I think both of your last names are important", "NTA, this is no one's business but you and your wife, and it sounds like you're on the same page. Personally, I think it would be much weirder and more confusing to give the two siblings different last names, I think if you gave your daughter your wife's last name then you're committed to giving any future children the same last name", "NTA\n\nIt's not even legal in my country to give two full siblings a different last name.", "NTA. They're your kids, but honestly I have a different last name from my sister. It's been an issue exactly zero times.", "NTA.

It wasn't a big deal.\n\nBut I also know someone who went with the wife's name for all their kids - which was the deal going in before they had them.\n\nPeople make such a fuss. I have a nephew and niece who have, uh, stereotypical first names for this era, stuff that 50 years ago no one viewed as names.\n\nIt was a bit odd to start with, but it took all of about 30 seconds for it to become completely ordinary.\n\nAnd you know what? I never once commented on it to my brother or his wife. Not my monkeys, not my circus.

The actual sexist thing is assuming his last name is somehow superior and the daughter is somehow losing out by not getting it. If his and his wife's last names have equal value, there's nothing wrong with either kid getting either name.", "Why would they look sexist?  It\u2019s pretty progressive in the US to have any kid take a moms last name if the parents are married", "Myself and my 5 siblings have different last names, some have my dads last name, and some have my moms. It\u2019s not that odd and it was kinda fun having different last names and not be known as my older siblings \u201cyounger sister\u201d going into classes he had been in the year before.

Kind of a stretch imo but I could see someone genuinely assuming that. Op NTA and change your last name to your wife\u2019s just to be petty", "Because the general assumption is the girl's name will be lost eventually so it doesn't matter, so if he gets to give the boy his last name it will persist, therefore making it the one that actually matters. Obviously that is not the case every time, as it literally didn't happen with OP and his wife, but when I was growing up I was told my name didn't matter because I was a girl. It doesn't seem like the motivation is sexism here though, at least not to me.", "Giving your girls your wife\u2019s last name and giving boys the dads is sexist because it\u2019s basically saying \u201cwell their names will change anyway so let\u2019s throw a pity last name on there, the boys will carry on my name\u201d.", "Since the son would have dad's last name and the daughter would have mom's. It could be viewed that he didn't care because the daughter was going to change her last name. It plays into a lot of sexist tradition of the value of having boys vs girls.", "Yeah I know lots of siblings with different last names because they have different dads. It\u2019s not a big deal. But I also think if the parents are happy that\u2019s what matters. You don\u2019t want to start letting grandparents stick their fingers in about stuff like this.", "My last name is different from my brothers' because they had a different dad than me.
