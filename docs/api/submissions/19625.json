So, I was at the gym in my apartment complex just finishing up some free weight exercises getting ready to go do some cardio to wrap things up. I woman walks in with her daughter. The girl was 3 or 4 if I had to guess. As per the rules of my building kids under the age of 16 aren\u2019t allowed to be in the gym (16 & 17 y/o need to be accompanied by an adult) but I don\u2019t really care, it doesn\u2019t bother me if a kid is there. When I finish my last rep I go over to the ellipticals. All of them are being used except one, but the young girl is sitting on it using it as a swing. I don\u2019t really like confrontation but I really wanted to do some cardio and I have a bad knee so I have to use the elliptical if I want to do cardio. I walked up to the mother and politely asked her if I could use the elliptical that her daughter was playing on. She gave me a weird look and without saying anything to me, called her daughter over. I got on the elliptical and the daughter started crying and throwing a temper tantrum at her mom and kept pointing to me. Maybe I\u2019m paranoid but I\u2019m pretty sure I could see the mom giving me dirty looks. After about 5 minutes of the girl crying, the mom stops her workout gives me another mean glance and leaves the gym.", "created_utc": 1686754134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1499tzx/aita_asking_mother_to_get_toddler_off_of_gym/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
