We also have an 18 year old son together who lives primarily with me and visits his mother a few times a week. \n\nMy son has been working really hard the past year. He has been doing great in school and also helps out a lot around the house. He has taken on a big role helping out in taking care of his 2 year old brother the past few months because my wife (35F) is currently 7 months pregnant with our 2nd baby and is having a hard time. My son has also been working a job on the weekends to save up for a car he really wants. He is set to graduate in a few weeks.\n\nI've really noticed how hard my son has been working for the past year and how much he is contributing in the household the past few months. So as a graduation gift, I wanted to get him something special for all his efforts. The car my son wants would take him definitely a few years to save up for so that seemed like a great gift. So I bought him the car he wanted as a gift and he really enjoys it. It was definitely an expensive gift for an 18 year old but he deserved it.\n\nA couple of days ago out of the blue, I got multiple messages from my ex wife. She went off about me buying our son this expensive car without consulting her first. I told her that our son is a legal adult so I'm in no way obligated to consult her for that. She said that as his mother she has a right to be part of a decision like this. I just repeated that he is 18 so I don't need to ask her for permission in any way for this. This turned into her getting angrier and even insulting me on how incompetent of a parent I am.

My bad. \n\nI think you\u2019re missing the point here. If a bank loans money to your adult kid, there no issue. If your kid\u2019s friends bought him a car, you might want a heads up just in case you were going to do the same. But neither of those things is the same as the mother of your child. That\u2019s a false equivalency. \n\nLike I said, all parents co parent if it\u2019s more than one parent. Divorced or not, co parents still need to communicate with one another and have enough respect to loop each other in on things like this. If she took it to court would she win? No. But some things are more important than the letter of the law. \n\nExes should be important if you share a kid together and both want to be involved in their lives. And don\u2019t did the respect angle. Much of how society runs outside of what is and isn\u2019t legal is basic respect.", "Dudes 18. He can be bought presents without mummies permission now. \n\nI think when raising kids you take things like this into consideration more to not play sides or make someone insecure about what they can offer compared. But if someone is 18 and they've been helping you greatly, you no longer need to worry that mummy might get upset that a gift is to much. It's way beyond the point where this stuff matters. \n\nBeing mad about it is just insecurity. And why would you cater to someone you don't live with being insecure, if it gets in the way of making the people you are close to happy? The only negative outcome of a nice gift is that mum might not feel she can compete. But if she's a nice mum that doesn't matter. My dad bought lots of stuff for me and I still chose mum my whole life.", "The mother of my child doesn't mean ANYTHING to me if I am not with that person and the child is an adult. Nothing. Zero.

It's great if you choose to co-parent, I could see that being the best option, but I'm sure that doesn't work for everyone.  Especially considering that they got a divorce in the first place.  \n\nLet's flip this the other way and pretend OP said \"I don't want my son to have a car at all because he hasn't been helping the family enough!\" - do you think the other parent shouldn't be able to step in and buy a car for the kid?  Different reasons, of course, but the same idea of each parent having individual agency over their own child.", "If you want to \"co-parent\" then stay together and work it out.  Have you ever considered that part of the reason why people with kids divorce is that they *completely disagree* with each other's parenting styles?  In that case, how would you determine who gets to decide on what car to buy, what the curfew should be, etc if both parties had completely differing opinions?\n\nOtherwise - you be the parent you want for your child and realize that the other parent will do the same.  Your only real relation to that person at that point is that you slept together at least once.", "Ex wife gets no say in his financial decisions. Buying a car is not that big of a deal.", "Wouldn\u2019t make sense she\u2019s jealous SHE didn\u2019t get a car from her ex husband of half a decade whos since remarried and had other kids imo. It\u2019s probably just the more realistic \u201cplenty of parents think it teaches kids to be entitled to get them new expensive cars as their first car\u201d. And I mean, I definitely agree teenage boys shouldn\u2019t have a new car as their first vehicle, so any fender benders aren\u2019t that big of a deal, but it\u2019s his kid to do as he pleases I suppose. \n\nNot a great idea to have that sort of attitude though. I would like to think even if I divorced my partner they would respect a kid has two parents who should at least get to voice an opinion on major decisions like this.", "This", "But it\u2019s also something OP is giving in acknowledgement of how much of a help his son is being to OP\u2019s household. It\u2019s not something that the son\u2019s mother should be expected to have a part in. Her expressed objections don\u2019t make sense either though.", ">On top of that she probably thinks it makes her look like a garbage parent because the dad bought it and she had no part in it.\n\nI mean, OP did say his son lives primarily with him and visits a few times with his mother a week. \n\nThe fact is this car is sort of the coup de grace that OP's ex feels he has done to ruin her relationship with his mother, which OP doesn't think of doing.", "Yup. Jealous of her ex for being able to give the gift at the very least, but possibly jealous of the gift itself.", "Probably envious. At least I hope not jealous that would just be sad.", "No. That\u2019s not what I said. I\u2019m not making any assumptions here. I\u2019m completely willing to believe it didn\u2019t cross his mind. However, he\u2019s asking if it was an ah thing to do and I\u2019m saying yes given the info we have. Why are people so quick to assume my intentions? It\u2019s like I\u2019m telling him he needs to bend to her every whim. I\u2019m saying he should have looped her in. Not asked for permission or defer to her judgement. Just loop her in. Christ almighty.", "Lol ooook. That\u2019s kind of a crap way of looking at it. Like some people can\u2019t stay together or it\u2019s not good for the kids if they do cause they\u2019re fighting all the time. There\u2019s nothing wrong with divorce and no one should be penalized or treated disrespectfully because of it.", "I got both kids a car for their 16th. I did not buy them brand new because I knew the chances of them bumping something with a car was high. So I didn't want them stressed at the idea of a fenderbender on a car thousands of dollars.", "I don't think most people draw much of a distinction between those two words.", "u/Alarming_Reply_6286\u2019s original comment directly acknowledged that OP didn\u2019t _have_ to do anything, so I don\u2019t know why all the responses keep harping on OP not needing to tell his wife. The point of the comment was to ask why, rather than speculate as all these replies are doing. I don\u2019t get why that warrants so many downvotes.", "Once again, just pointing out why someone WOULD want to give an ex a heads up on gifts for their shared kid, not judging OP's situation. Literally just answering a question presented.", "I don't get why there's so many downvotes either I feel like we were having a pretty good discussion.", "Because at 18, he is not a child anymore; he is in fact an adult who happened to receive a gift from his father.\n\nSo if he decides to marry tomorrow what should he do? ask mommy and daddy for their permission to marry? this is not how adults behave.", "Do you have older kids or exes?", "Same, and now it looks like even my post wondering what all the downvotes were for is joining the downvote train \ud83e\udd37\ud83d\ude35", " The other person and I obviously have a little differing opinion but I didn't think we were being rude or mean to each other. \n\nBut this is Reddit and now that you and I have shown we aren't downvoting the other person were gonna get downvoted to oblivion."]}
