We also have an 18 year old son together who lives primarily with me and visits his mother a few times a week. \n\nMy son has been working really hard the past year. He has been doing great in school and also helps out a lot around the house. He has taken on a big role helping out in taking care of his 2 year old brother the past few months because my wife (35F) is currently 7 months pregnant with our 2nd baby and is having a hard time. My son has also been working a job on the weekends to save up for a car he really wants. He is set to graduate in a few weeks.\n\nI've really noticed how hard my son has been working for the past year and how much he is contributing in the household the past few months. So as a graduation gift, I wanted to get him something special for all his efforts. The car my son wants would take him definitely a few years to save up for so that seemed like a great gift. So I bought him the car he wanted as a gift and he really enjoys it. It was definitely an expensive gift for an 18 year old but he deserved it.\n\nA couple of days ago out of the blue, I got multiple messages from my ex wife. She went off about me buying our son this expensive car without consulting her first. I told her that our son is a legal adult so I'm in no way obligated to consult her for that. She said that as his mother she has a right to be part of a decision like this. I just repeated that he is 18 so I don't need to ask her for permission in any way for this. This turned into her getting angrier and even insulting me on how incompetent of a parent I am.

That's mighty generous of ya, I reckon.\n\nSure, the car might be expensive for an 18-year-old, but you believed he earned it.

Poor kids in that situation.", "It\u2019s just weird to me. Obviously, Mom was going to find out & the kid is only 18. (Yes legally an adult) I just always look at if the roles were reversed would this be okay? Honestly, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to exclude the other parent from big decisions. Getting a new car is a big deal. I don\u2019t get it.... it just basic information about their shared child.\n\nI guess in this situation it was really on the kid to tell his Mom. So crazy that 2 people can make a child & then not be able to have a conversation about that child. Weird", "I also think that communication and permission are getting mixed up here. I don\u2019t think he needs to ask permission of his ex. I think he should have said \u201chey ex wife, I\u2019m planning on buying our kid a car.

My bad. \n\nI think you\u2019re missing the point here. If a bank loans money to your adult kid, there no issue. If your kid\u2019s friends bought him a car, you might want a heads up just in case you were going to do the same. But neither of those things is the same as the mother of your child. That\u2019s a false equivalency. \n\nLike I said, all parents co parent if it\u2019s more than one parent. Divorced or not, co parents still need to communicate with one another and have enough respect to loop each other in on things like this. If she took it to court would she win? No. But some things are more important than the letter of the law. \n\nExes should be important if you share a kid together and both want to be involved in their lives. And don\u2019t did the respect angle. Much of how society runs outside of what is and isn\u2019t legal is basic respect.", "Dudes 18. He can be bought presents without mummies permission now. \n\nI think when raising kids you take things like this into consideration more to not play sides or make someone insecure about what they can offer compared. But if someone is 18 and they've been helping you greatly, you no longer need to worry that mummy might get upset that a gift is to much. It's way beyond the point where this stuff matters. \n\nBeing mad about it is just insecurity. And why would you cater to someone you don't live with being insecure, if it gets in the way of making the people you are close to happy? The only negative outcome of a nice gift is that mum might not feel she can compete. But if she's a nice mum that doesn't matter.
