D and her husband are not, and most of our other friends are not as well.\n\nNow that I am back at work, I decided that it was also a time to get back to a routine somewhat close to my old one. I did not want to be the kind of woman who only defines herself as a mother (and there is nothing wrong with that), and like I said, I have the means to help with that.\n\nWe hired an au-pair, and it has been life changing. I still spend a lot of time being a mom, and I love my daughter, but now I get to go to the gym, I am rested because I don\u2019t have to be up with her at night, I can go to brunch with my friends, and last Saturday, I even went clubbing (I didn\u2019t drink since I breastfeed, but I still had fun with my friends).\n\nOn the other hand, D is exhausted, and has not had the time to go out with us (very understandable), so we made sure to go visit her, and the one time she agreed to go to brunch, we made sure to chose a child friendly restaurant.\n\nAfter seeing some photos we posted on social media of us enjoying the club, she sent a text in the GC asking why we didn\u2019t invite her, another friend said she was invited, but she declined since she could not spend that much time away from her son. Then D said that we should have done what she suggested instead, which was to have a nice dinner at a family friendly restaurant, then just spend a couple hours at home chatting. The same friend replied that we did that last weekend, and that they wanted to have fun.\n\nD said that it wasn\u2019t fair that she was excluded for being a mom, but the same friend replied that she wasn\u2019t, and that she was being dramatic. Then she said if we were excluding moms, My Name would have been excluded too.\n\nD then calls me. As soon as I pick up, she started scolding me about giving our friends a false idea of what being a mom is, that most of them do not have the means to hire help the way I do, that normal people have to sacrifice a lot of things once they have kids, and that me not having to do that makes her seem like a bad friend, and stops our other friends from accommodating her.\n\nAt the time I did not know what the whole deal was about, but I could kind of understand the situation, so I told her that normal moms leave their kids with their fathers to go out with their friends, it was entitled people who expected the whole world to change because they decided to have kids.\n\nAfter reading the whole argument on the GC though, I think that I went overboard, and that I really might be doing exactly what she accused me of.

The group isn\u2019t excluding her, especially if they occasionally accommodate her motherhood. Of course the group dynamics were going to change. She can\u2019t honestly expect that a mostly child free group is suddenly going to want to only socialize around breastfeeding schedules and baby friendly themes. She\u2019s also probably more than a little jealous that you have the means to acquire help and to get some of your life back.", "I'm 100% going NTA. \n\nBecause I read the bloody text and can understand that at the time you didn't realise what the hell was going on and whilst you maybe didn't need to shout, you're not exactly wrong in stating that, yes she could have babies father look after their child had she wanted to attend. \n\nIf you all manage to not have your own kids i can't blame you for not wanting to accommodate someone else's and going to a family friendly restaurant, especially when you did that the week before. \n\nIt also kind of sounds like she's choosing not to spend time away from her son, then blaming others that she's not getting breaks/ability to participate in fun stuff (you say she's only accepted on invite out) \n\nIt sounds like maybe father isn't stepping in or she is putting too much of the care of LO on herself and is starting to crumble under the pressure and you got the brunt that day.", "NTA. \n\nYour friend sounds resentful, and that's unfortunate, but you don't need to artificially suffer more for the sake of comradery. Life is harder for some people, and that's more difficult to ignore when you see your friends have it easier.", "NTA- some people may say you were being harsh but you were giving her a reality check. Nothing you said was inaccurate. It is entitled people who expects the world to change because they decided to have kids. She out of no where decides to call you up and berate you... for living your life? No family dynamic is the same, motherhood doesn't look the same for everyone. It's ridiculous that she's trying to say you've done anything wrong by giving your friends \"a false idea of what being a Mom is,\" like what does that even mean? \n\nIt sounds like she's hurt and feeling left out (and probably jealous that you can afford childcare while she can't) but unforatetly that sometimes happen when you have kids and most of your friends don't.

Motherhood was not meant to be an all encompassing role. Mothers and parents were supposed to have family and friends and communities aid in raising children. \n\nWhile I agree that\u2019s it\u2019s not fair or right that supports systems are becoming more and more a privilege of the wealthy, as even familial help is less now due to people needing to work more and living farther away, none of that is your fault.\n\nYour friend was wrong to lash out at you.\n\nYou were wrong to shame her for not having what you have.", "ESH. Your friend is not being reasonable for expecting her entire group of friends (most of whom do not have children) to change every event so that she can bring her child. And your behavior in no way means that she is a bad friend. You have a different lifestyle and that is fine.\n\nBut wow, you were pretty out of line in your response to her. You acknowledge that you have an incredible amount of privilege that she doesn't have. \"Normal moms leave their kids with their fathers to go out with their friends\". Normal moms don't do any such thing, because there is no such thing as a normal mom! That was a shit thing to say to a friend of yours.", "ESH. Yes, you have the means to hire help and live differently than a lot of parents.

Her baby is still very young and its understandable that she\u2019s not ready to leave him. \nShe is tired and is probably extra sensitive for that reason. Arrange to do some things together and give her the heads up again if you\u2019re going clubbing.", "How to put this?\nNTA for going out when you have the means to do so. It's much needed time out. So do it when you can and want.\n\nA bit of YTA for telling her to be entitled when in reality she just can't afford what you can.\nShe has no au pair. Most people don't.\n\nAlso, every child is different. Mine wasn't able to sleep without her mom formthe first 6 months for the love of it. Cried all the time. No chance for me.\nLuckily our group of friends accomodated that. \nBut also my wife and I were abke to accept that the others Go out sometimes without us. We so not need to hang Out together all the time.\nWhen children happened to the others we were the ones to accomodate them. And also they accepted us to go out without them.\nBut if you want this friendship to live: talk. Otherwise it will disrupt your friendship. It already started and your blunt statement for sure didn't help.\nBut you are already aware of that. Otherwise you wouldn't post here.\nSo go on. Talk as a group of friends and find solutions that help all of you. It will work. \nAnd maybe, only as an idea: is your au pair up to baby sit two toddlers once in a while? Just a thought.", "Soft ESH. \n\nI know people will go N T A but honestly you know your friend is super stressed. You could probably be less harsh. \n\nShe is obviously in the wrong though. Your childless friends are not idiots. They understand that having a kid is tough.", "NTA. Life is is different for everyone in different ways when they have children.

She is hurt that she wasn't there having fun. Maybe her husband was busy or is just too lazy to help out. \n\nYou are right though. The world does not adapt to you just because you have a child. She will continue to not be able to do certain things", "NTA\n\nEveryone makes their own choices and has to deal with the consequences of them. Your friend can't expect all of her friends to change how they socialise only because she's a mother now.\n\nAu pairs are not the only option to get help with one's kids.

The other 1% of the time, we specifically organise a child free get together because parents need a break too. Now that the other friend has started their family, we'll still have 99% of gatherings with the 3 kids.

I suggest reaching out to the friend directly and maybe whilst still enjoying some group activities do some mum friendly activities with her.

I hate doing this but your friend was wrong for assuming they have to accommodate her every single time due to her having a child. Also lashing out on you. You have nothing to do with her situation and should have been left out of it. What other people think or assume about parenting is none of your business. Yes you could leave your kid with their father or another family member but she may not have the support system you do. But she also needs to understand as friends, their whole world doesn't always revolve around them. Your friends are childless they have every right to want to enjoy that life and as long as they did the invite there is no obligation on their part. Friendship should be 50/50. Not 100% accommodating to everyone else all the time.", "Very very slight YTA just for phrasing. \n\nInstead of saying \u201cnormal moms\u2026\u201d\n\nYou should have said something more along the lines of \u201c you knew we were going clubbing, why didn\u2019t you have your H watch the baby for a few hours\u201d. (I\u2019m assuming these were plans made in advance.)\n\nDid she ever give a reason why her H couldn\u2019t watch the baby? \n\nIm thinking this has less to do with whether she was invited or not, and more to do with her mindset- she feels she\u2019s not back to her pre baby weight and has nothing to wear, she\u2019s has a mindset that moms don\u2019t do clubbing, and she\u2019s tired so the last thing she wants to do is something active, she just hasn\u2019t figured out a balance between being a mom and being her own person. Sometimes new moms get stuck in baby mode. \n\nShe\u2019s going to lose all her friends if she expects 7 other women are going to be happy with a social life that fully revolves around baby friendly activities.", "NAH.\n\nYou have the financial and support resources for your days to not be solely devoted to your child/providing for your child, so you have genuine Free Time in which you can do what you want.\n\nD does not have the financial and support resources to do that. And it's valid for her to feel a little hurt and excluded when she she's faced with fun things she wants to do but can't because of her lack of support. \n\nYou're able to hire a 'village' so you can get a break. She isn't. \n\nBut it's not fair of her to put her frustration and exhaustion about that on you. You were not being disrespectful of her, and you were not throwing your easier schedule in her face. Or, you weren't until you told her something she already knows and probably stung her immensely because for whatever reason it's inaccessible to her; that 'normal moms leave their kids with their fathers to go out with their friends'. Because not everyone has that option. And it's giving big 'recommending thrift to the poor' energy.\n\nImo you owe her an apology for that specific part of the conversation. But she also owes you one for projecting her frustrations about her own situation onto you. It might help to have a one-on-one talk with one another, because maybe she's struggling underwater and you're just seeing the violent flailing on the surface, and she could really use a friend who has at least some inkling of what postpartum can be like, even if your situations are very different. It sounds like she doesn't have much support any which way. It'd be nice, as a friend, if you reached out to check if she's okay.", "100% NTA, even if your response was a bit harsh. She called you to ask you to.. stop going out and living your life so your friends are not surprised she's busy as well? Your response wasn't THAT overboard compared to that.", "NTA- you're out there, living your life and not acting like D could do the same.\n\nD is acting entitled. I don't have kids, but I've been the broke friend for much of my life. As long as my friends are willing to do some activities that I can do, I'm not going to begrudge them when they do things I can't afford or otherwise not do because of work.", "Read most of (not all) the comments published up to this point. \n\nMy two cents is overall, NTA. \n\nYou definitely deserve the rebuking over the phrase normal moms, I also understand how those words slipped out in the heat of the moment. You weren't calling her style of mothering abnormal, you were arguing that your level of privilege is not a requirement to have a life outside of baby, while acknowledging that it helps yours. \n\nYes, D is stressed and overwhelmed and feels left out.\n\nThis is also a group that is making an effort to do family friendly activities sometimes to accommodate her but do not want to give up an activity they all enjoy because one of nine people regularly can't participate. \n\nLike, I understand why people are suggesting you could offer to do other things with D but the group IS doing that. They just don't want to do it all the time.\n\nIt sounds like D took her frustration at the way her life has changed (and possibly the fact that her baby's father expects her to be the primary caretaker full time) out in you. \n\nI do think, for the sake of the friendship, you should reach out, explain that you didn't have context on why she was so unhappy, and misspoke as a result. I also think you should make clear that you were not judging her capabilities or choices as a parent, but clumsily advocating for her right to do things for her own benefit sometimes.", "Are you abusing your au pair? Or did you hire a nanny? Au pairs have a maximum number of hours that they\u2019re supposed to work while they get to also experience the country they\u2019re living in.

She shouldn't have to defend her parenting choices to this woman or her friend group. This was an issue that the friend had with how group invites work. To single out OP because she is also a mom was wrong on D's part.", "Not all of us manage to meet every weekend, but at least most of us do. Did a SAHM, 2 other women are teachers, and the rest work 9-5 jobs, so we manage to meet most weekends.", "Agreed. OP is not in the wrong for how she manages her life with the resources she has, but given that she has significantly more resources than D, her childless friends, or most people - it's entirely not her place to say what \"normal moms\" do or imply that she's \"entitled.\"\n\nMost moms do have to shift into a bit more \"mommy life\" and I think you're right that D might have hoped for more company in that. It would be nice of OP to do some \"mommy activities\" with D sometimes, in addition to keeping up the life she wants with the overall friend group. D needs to also get real that choosing to become a parent often leads to drifting away from friends who didn't, for exactly these kinds of reasons.", "Good response.", ">\"Normal moms leave their kids with their fathers to go out with their friends\".

And it sounds like everyone made plans in advance. This wasn\u2019t a \u201clet\u2019s go to the club randomly on a Saturday!\u201d. They all probably planned it at the beginning of the week, D could\u2019ve asked her husband to stay home and look after the child.\n\nIn fact and I\u2019m assuming but it seems like every time they go out, D brings her kid.

On the other hand her friend is going to have to deal with the fact that given her situation she won't be able to make as many events in the past.
