My sister is 15 (F) who I will name Carla for the sake of this post.\n\nWe grew up with just our mum who worked very hard to put every meal on the table. Eventually she had slipped disk after slipped disk and struggled to do much of anything. As the eldest at home, I have been her carer for years. I am essentially the perfect child. I have perfect grades, and I just received a scholarship for my first choice university. My sister however is failing out of Secondary. She has always been the favourite though\n Everyone cooed over her and left nothing for me. I'm not bitter about it, just sad that I was deprived of having any kind of fair relationship with my family. Everyone always blamed me when things inevitably when bad. Carla is a stick insect whilst I have always been the bigger child. Recently I came into my own. My curves suit me, I look healthy, attractive. I constantly have boys mooning over me or being outright rude because I won't give out my Snapchat. (Sidenote, I am also gay)\n\nMy sister has started acting extremely jealous towards me for this sudden burst of attention I'm getting.\n\nOn my 13th birthday, I bought a hat. It's a beret. It's plain black but suits me perfectly. My sister however hates it. Two days ago, I put my beret on to match an outfit I was wearing as it was cold and my sister pulled a hissy fit and yanked it off of my head. She threatened to burn it and said I was doing it on purpose to make her feel shit and when I asked her wtf, she said I lost weight just to spite her, that I dress weird to embarrass her, that I go out of my way to make her life hell. Now me and Carla do not have a good relationship by any standard but this was extreme. She's the kind of girl who wears tracksuits and Jordans while I prefer big baggy jumpers and skirts. She went downstairs and told mum her side of the story while I was still getting changed nursing a sore head. I went downstairs to see what was going on and was yelled at for making my sister feel anxious. That my beret gives her anxiety. But I'm the one wearing it? The cussing and screaming that ensued when I tried to defend my actions was horrible. I had to just stand there and take it. As usual. Because I'm not normal to quote my sister. I'm hurt, and feel more cut off from the people I work hard to look after than ever. \n\nAm I the asshole for wearing a beret?", "created_utc": 1671360937, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zow1l4/aita_i_gave_my_sister_anxiety_my_wearing_a_hat/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister obviously wants to feel superior and tries to control you. Move out as soon as you can. You don't need such toxic relationships. Your family needs therapy or maybe just an outside opinion to realize how crazy they are. Have you told your mother that you don't feel loved and hurt all the time because regardless of what your sister does they always take her side? Also make a list of examples cause they usually deny doing such a thing.", "NTA. Anxiety and jealousy aren\u2019t the same thing. Rock your style and see this as the ridiculousness it is.", "Nta\n\nFind a way to move out as soon as you can. Work with a therapist to address any guilt you feel in doing so.  You've already gone above and beyond by being an unpaid child carer for your mother.\n\nPerhaps your mom will appreciate you more when she realizes how much you were doing for her.  It's also possible that she won't and she feels entitled to your help no matter how badly she treats you, so please don't bank on this.", "Obvious NTA. None of this even makes sense.", "NTA - keep pushing yourself and being a badass. University will start soon and then you can get away (and hopefully stay away) from your shitty sister.", "It does not sound like you are the asshole in this situation. It sounds like your sister is struggling with feelings of jealousy and insecurity, and she is projecting those feelings onto you and your beret. It is not fair for her to blame you or lash out at you for things that have nothing to do with you. It is also not fair for her to make you feel like you have to justify your actions or the way you dress.\r  \n\r  \nIt is understandable that you would feel hurt and upset by your sister's behavior. It is important to remember that you are not responsible for her feelings or actions. You have a right to express yourself and make your own choices, including what you wear. It might be helpful to try to communicate with your sister and see if you can find a way to resolve the situation peacefully. You could try talking to her and explaining how her behavior makes you feel, and see if you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you. Alternatively, it might be helpful to seek the support of a trusted adult or counselor to help you navigate this difficult dynamic with your sister.", "NTA. Your sister needs to get over herself. I have 3 siblings, out of which I'm the youngest. I am also the smallest and in my opinion, the least attractive. This had led me to all kinds of insecure moments as a kid. My insecurities were nobody's responsibility to deal with, but my own. She'll live if you wear whatever you want to wear. You aren't responsible for your sibling's emotional reactions to whatever it is you want to wear. Just know that it's far from the end of the world. P.s., I now have one of the highest paying careers and the nicest house if any of my brothers. She'll be fine if she chooses to be. Not your problem.", "NTA  \nYour sister needs to see a therapist as there is definitely a lot of underlying issues.", "NTA. Carla is insecure and Jealous. Your mum is AH for not defending you and enabling her issues.", "NTA - you did nothing wrong, your sister is a spoiled rat", "NTA.\n\nYour family is very weird and abusive. Go no contact and continue to succeed in life. Don\u2019t look back.", "NTA", "NTA of course. Will you leave home as soon as you turn 18?", "NTA. It sounds like you've had to take on a lot of responsibility way too early in your life and that you've got little thanks for it. \n\nCongratulations on your scholarship to uni. Uni is going to be your way out. Hold on til then if you can. Even if you're going to a local university, you MUST MOVE OUT.\n\nIt's a good bet that your mum/sister/wider family will try to make you feel bad for moving away. Don't let them guilt you into moving back home, or coming home regularly to help out.\n\nUnis also tend to have free counselling services. That might be helpful to help you work through some of this stuff, and give you the strength to deal with the family dynamics.", "NTA. Your sister isn't anxious, she's jealous. Suddenly you're getting attention that she craves and instead of dealing with, she'd rather tell lies about you and get you into trouble. And because she is the golden child, she gets away with it.\n\nAs long as your sister has this level of influence on your family, no one is going to be on your side and no one will appreciate you and your efforts, so the minute you can leave, you should. And I can guarantee that the minute you leave and they no longer have your labor as your mother's carer to depend on, they still won't appreciate you, but will demand you come back. At which point, you'll have to decide how much contact you want to continue to have with your family.", "This post is better suited to /r/relationships or /r/relationship_advice. \n\nThe hat is irrelevant; it\u2019s just a symptom of the bigger problem, which is the rivalry between you and your sister.  She\u2019s the golden child while you try to take care of your mother and still do well in school, and you suddenly becoming attractive is a shock to her.  \n\nYou both deeply resent each other and some family counseling might well be a good idea.", "NTA\n\nUnlike your sister and your family. \n\nGood news, it won\u2019t be long before you can leave for university. You come across as someone who achieves stuff so you will boss that too.\n\nMore importantly you will be out of that toxic household.

GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE! I don't get why there is so much unjustness in the world. So hatred from own families. It always makes me love my mom and sis more. This sounds like a lot toxic place. Just get out. Am so sorry.", "Carla needs serious therapy. It sounds like she resents you because she is now disabled and because you didn\u2019t suffer the same fate. I feel for her, but how she is behaving is not right. She can\u2019t treat you like crap because you are happy. It\u2019s also not your fault that she is going through a tough time.\n\nWear your hat however you want to.

But even then, Black Power is cool.", "NTA.  It's terrible that you have to ask that question.  Of course you should wear your beret.  If your sister can't take it and you mother chastises you, maybe you should consider not taking on so much responsibility.

Wow, your sister sounds like an entitled brat - it's not all about her.  Your beret has nothing to do with any anxiety on her part.  She's totally overreacted and actually doesn't sound too stable.

She probably needs therapy.", "NTA for wanting to wear a clothing item \u2014 the beret \u2014 you look good in but a little Ah for choosing to put it on in the house where you supposedly know it\u2019s going to set your sister off.

You might want to put a vote into this top comment.", "I don\u2019t see the struggle.  Seems sister has long embraced her jealousy and gone mean because mommy dearest will back her.  Sister does not make any effort to rebuff those unreasonable feelings, so no struggle.", "I'm not in a position to..I turn 18 in January, but because of all the paperwork for Uni I need to stay home till I move out for Uni", "I do agree that OP is not the asshole and her sister is wrong.\n\nBut I think to say jealously and anxiety are not at all intertwined to some degree is inaccurate. Jealously comes from fear. Anxiety is fear or worry. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s just jealous. I\u2019m sure the jealously stems from the fear that she herself wouldn\u2019t get enough attention. Maybe subconsciously she knows there\u2019s an imbalance between how she is treated vs OP and she finds the idea that the balance will change to be threatening. Unfortunately she was cool with it when it worked in her favor.\n\nShe\u2019s worried she\u2019d be in her sister\u2019s shoes because her sister is rising out of that. This should be her opportunity to put herself in OP\u2019s shoes but her sister is only 15. Her parents have let this behavior go on and have not taught her how to handle her feelings of insecurity. Most people don\u2019t know how to handle their insecurities well and people act out in all kinds of weird ways because of anxiety.\n\nAnger, sadness, depression and many more feelings are all rooted in anxiety at times. The anger, etc. is the expression of the anxiety (trying to manipulate an outcome through anger, get your way, etc. is the unhealthy way of dealing with the anxiety of dreading the outcome you are trying to prevent).\n\nIt\u2019s still wrong but to say there\u2019s no anxiety behind that, I find hard to believe.\n\nHer sister I think has a larger insecurity problem than OP maybe knows. Of course OP does, too, and I don\u2019t want to diminish that. However, they both are living in unbalanced circumstances. If her sister gets the highest praises at home and none out in life, cause her measure of what that should be is off, it\u2019s going to result in anxiety/insecurity/jealously in her, too.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to call her deserving of the anxiety/insecurity/jealously because of her behavior but no one becomes a way in the world alone. We all are built and broken by the world and each other. In the best ways and worst of ways. OP\u2019s sister will need someone to extend a hand to her, too, at some point. Therapy would be great but I don\u2019t see her sister on a good track record to seek it out herself without some help and understanding from someone. I don\u2019t know who should give this to her, OP is essentially also a kid.\n\nBut it would be cool for some sisterly love to happen. But it\u2019s hard in this scenario. OP has had to be the bigger person her entire life it sounds like. I would understand why she wouldn\u2019t want to be anymore but I think she might be who her sister will need a little love from in the end so she can get out of this toxic cycle, too. I don\u2019t know that her sister would be receptive to her - she doesn\u2019t know why she acts how she does to some degree I\u2019m willing to bet and doesn\u2019t think anything is wrong with her behavior yet cause there has been no consequences outside her family. By the time she\u2019s willing to want help, too, she\u2019ll likely be a mess, have gone through and destroyed multiple relationships, and it will be hard at that point.", "I'm confused. How is Carla disabled?", "I see where Mom is coming from but this is exactly zero excuse for treating you this way.\n\nNo. Just no. Maybe try boundaries, but it seems she is not used of the concept of boundaries.\n\nAnd please understand it's not your fault, please do not feel guilty for what is done to you, this behaviour is just right off the chart!", "I'm sorry you can't yet. When can you start uni?\nI have the feeling you have to care way too much for your family while not getting anything (but shouting) in return. You deserve better....", "September 2023.", "I hope you get through those last months without to much drama and screaming. Wish you all the best!"]}
