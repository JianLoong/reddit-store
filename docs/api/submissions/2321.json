Whether he cheated or simply said he did to get out of the marriage, sounds like he just wants out, might even be playing up things to get the divorce faster. He's decided he doesn't want to be a part of the child's life any more, and by extension due to her stance on things, his wife's life. He valued his \"freedom\" more than his daughter.

You could talk with your ex-SIL and work something out where she will continue to be in your life.\nNTA. Good luck with this.", "NTA honestly keep supporting your sister in law and niece", "NTA because it doesn't seem like your brother cared much for his own child anyway. Him considering putting his child up for adoption after his (ex-) wife spent 9-10 months carrying her and then pushing her out just so he can have a fun for little longer is so selfish. He shouldn't be mad that his ex-wife wants full custody because he didn't want custody before the divorce papers were served to begin with.", "NTA\n\nWhy would he want to have custody now? Taking care of a kid alone is even more stressful than when you have a partner there to help you out and that's when he wanted to put her up for adoption. Your brother is an ah.", "NTA - sounds like your brother has growing up to do. Children are not things you can put aside or give someone when you don't want them anymore.

Bravo to you for standing up to your brother and for your SIL and your niece. Your brother is the AH here. He seems to forget, having unprotected sex with someone, there are consequences and that resulted in his daughter he doesn't want. He's an asshole, because most people can't have kids and would trade anything to be in his shoes. \n\nHe cheated and doesn't want to be a dad. WTF is he crying about then? He got his way out. He needs to grow up. \n\nI wish you nothing but happiness. You have a good head on your shoulders.", "NTA. Change friends. Your bro is TA af.   \nI just can't believe what weird execuses and reasons man can invent just to cover he had cheated. Yesterday I read about guy who broke up with girl because she \"ate too much during Valentine dinner\" (she can, she has hyperglykemia) and then he admitted he chated (was seeing someone else). But this was only riddiculus excuse, this \"let's put our daughter for adoption...\" \"no way, what's going on?!\" \"whoops...ok... you know, I cheated\" is something like... wtf is wrong with your brother's head?

Your brother cheated, which obviously was awful for his ex-wife. 2. He tried to give her up for adoption. 3. Unless you lie, you aren't doing anything other than making sure the truth is heard.

He's selfish.  His wife deserves to have full custody when he openly said he said wanted to give away his child.  Why wouldn't you tell the truth to the judge, when it's in the best interests of the child? \n\nThere are people that think being relatives excuses horrible behaviors.  They are wrong.  I wonder how much less crime and pain in the world there would be, if families would stop making excuses for the relatives that are selfish jerks, and would hold them accountable.  Your brother didn't just make one mistake, he's made a whole series of them, and all of them are based on his own selfishness.\n\nI think you are right, to put the child first, not your AH brother.", "NTA.

So if this is real he's got everything he wants.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother dishonored his child and his wife.  \n\nIt's jaw dropping that he wanted to give away his toddler daughter so he \"can have fun.\"  And then sulked when your family was horrified.

I can't get past the fact that any human being would just offhandedly come up with \"let's put our child up for adoption so wifey and I can have fun while we are young\" type thought process.  His ex wife should be awarded full custody of the child, for her well-being and safety.  She should have his wages garnered for full support until he turns green.  And I can't imagine this person ever having been worthy of admiration or love from anyone.  Scary.", "The fact that multiple people witnessed him saying that he wanted to put the child up for adoption will definitely make a difference in a custody hearing.", "[deleted]", "His involvement in the situation is helping his brother\u2019s wife in getting custody of his niece. In my opinion, it\u2019s great that he\u2019s helping her out in this.", "The man wanted to put his toddler up for adoption for no reason. Something is not right with his head. The kid and mom definitely need and deserve support from their family and witnesses to the dad's behavior.", "I'd be worried that he'd secretly try to arrange an adoption for her if he had partial custody.", "I doubt it. If he changed his mind what does it matter? Basically unless you\u2019re an unfit parent (and even then) most courts won\u2019t rule against 50/50 custody if you want it.", "My point is the brother has already dug himself a grave. If they want to testify that's great but I don't really think the ex needs their help because brother will continue to make himself look like he's an unfit ah. He's going to crash and burn without their help. Sometimes it's better to just sit back and watch people like that tailspin.", "[deleted]", "So would I. Or that he hurts the child because he blames her for his problems.", "I'm pretty sure judges do very much care what witnesses have to say about things that defendants/parties have done or said.", "NTA - No one in your immediate family thinks what your brother is doing is okay, which is exactly why he reached out to extended family to make sure someone has his back. This is immature behavior. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for what you said. Now if you just told him out of no where, then I\u2019d say yes, but if he was trying to justify his actions, then I don\u2019t have a problem for what you said.

Dude was trying to put the kid up for adoption, losing his parental rights seems like exactly what he wanted \n\nObvious NTA", "NTA.  It is refreshing to see a family actually stand up for their child's spouse over their own child after they've done something wrong.  Usually, the family just backs their own blood no matter the \"sin\".", "NTA\n\nHe deliberately CHOOSE to cheat. No one but himself to blame for his actions.  His wife filing for divorce is the consequence.", "NTA!! Your brother is selfish and has a lot of growing up to do.", "NTA.. A mistake? Seriously I don't understand when they call cheating that.

But he's your brother. Yes he cheated. And putting his daughter up for adoption is the most ridiculous thing Ive ever heard. But are you going to disown him?

How would they feel if someone did that to them.\n\nYour brother doesn't want  custody and no judge is going to give him any once he finds out your brother wanted to give his kid away and when that wasn't agreeable, went out and cheated.

If it was my brother, I would feel exactly the same way you do. How horrible!", "All those family giving you grief need to realize that he wanted to adopt out their daughter in order to live a childfree life as a couple after she was already born. That's why his ex is going for full custody and frankly I hope she gets it because she obviously wants her child in her life. Also it seems harsh to stiff arm your brother but if the ex does get custody you and your parents need to be in her good graces if you guys want access to your niece/granddaughter. NTA.", "NTA. The only one in this whole story is your brother.", "NTA. I don't condone cheating in the slightest, but that's not even the biggest issue here. The biggest issue is that the brother wanted kids and then tried to nope out of the situation by lying and other stuff. Good for you for supporting your now ex-SIL.", "100%Nta, he's the one who went too far, and decided to cheating and treat his wife and child poorly, for his own selfish desires, so stick to your guns and everybody else who say otherwise can go pound sand, because he doesn't get to get away with treating people poorly like he did, and no this is not a mistake, he made a selfish choice to do this to people who didn't deserve any of this, so help your sister-in-law and don't look back, because he needs to grow up.", "I am actually honestly surprised that you're not certain whether your NTA or not. So NTA imo. Actions have consequences. You don't like the consequences? Tough shouldn't have made the choices. Hopefully you can stay in your nieces life.
