Stellar extended family. If I read it correctly your friends think you are wrong? NTA.", "NTA Cheaters should get half custody. Cheating doesn't prevent you from being a good parent. But when he wanted to give his daughter free for adaption then he shouldn't get any custody for her.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for standing up for your niece and her mom!\n\nWhat an absolutely crappy AH thing for him to say. What kind of person says he wants to give up his daughter - presumably right in front of her as well as her mom? That is outright cruel.\n\nAnd then to have a tantrum when his family gets upset, run out and cheat on his wife.

He made a series of really selfish choices. You're absolutely right in your response.", "NTA  what exactly did you look up to?", "Funny how families are, my family is all totally fine with cheating and actually makes sure we all get to have an affair every few years. I suppose it takes all sorts.", "This wasn't a mistake on his part.  This was a series of very poor decisions on his part.  He is now dealing with the consequences of those decisions.\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t know where your from but in the USA whatever you might have to say about him other than if he\u2019s abusive or a drug addict won\u2019t matter at all in a custody case.", "NTA. Whether he cheated or simply said he did to get out of the marriage, sounds like he just wants out, might even be playing up things to get the divorce faster. He's decided he doesn't want to be a part of the child's life any more, and by extension due to her stance on things, his wife's life. He valued his \"freedom\" more than his daughter. So, he can't complain when he looses those things and has his freedom.", "NTA! I like your family but dispise your brother. He is not the man you thought he was and deserves everything he's got coming", "NTA.  It's a fact that he cheated and now his wife is going to make him pay by divorcing him.  His wife has a great chance of full custody I would think.  \n\nNot sure how you could be the AH here, it was such an AH move for your brother to want to put his own 3 yr daughter up for adoption that it's not something that anyone should \"look past\".", "You're NTA for what you said but might I suggest you take a big step out of his business? What is going on is between his wife and himself and he will suffer the consequences of his actions without your involvement.", "NTA.\n\nHe decided to try and put his daughter up for adoption to get out of the responsibility of raising his own child, but also cheated on his wife and gave your extended family crocodile tears of despondency to make them regard all of you as the villains in this situation.", "He can\u2019t just put your niece up for adoption when she still has a mother.  Extended family needs to mind their own business.  \nMaybe you need to cool off and then figure out how you feel about him, the situation.  She will always be your niece.  You could talk with your ex-SIL and work something out where she will continue to be in your life.\nNTA. Good luck with this.", "NTA honestly keep supporting your sister in law and niece", "NTA because it doesn't seem like your brother cared much for his own child anyway. Him considering putting his child up for adoption after his (ex-) wife spent 9-10 months carrying her and then pushing her out just so he can have a fun for little longer is so selfish. He shouldn't be mad that his ex-wife wants full custody because he didn't want custody before the divorce papers were served to begin with.", "NTA\n\nWhy would he want to have custody now? Taking care of a kid alone is even more stressful than when you have a partner there to help you out and that's when he wanted to put her up for adoption. Your brother is an ah.", "NTA - sounds like your brother has growing up to do. Children are not things you can put aside or give someone when you don't want them anymore. On top of that, instead of talking to his wife, the first time they had a major difficulty he ran off and cheated. Imo he does not deserve them and you are not ah for saying what is.", "Nta", "NTA to be supportive of your SIL but unless you are her attorney, you were just grandstanding. Hopefully, your brother has been medically checked out. I don\u2019t know whether it would be better if he has a brain tumor or if he\u2019s just selfish to nth degree.", "HARD NTA. He chose to do what he did. He just regrets it now, there's a difference between a \"mistake\" and being selfish. And to actually try and give up your own child, I'd be doing the same as you OP.", "Absolutely NTA. Your brother\u2019s behavior is hideous.", "NTA! Bravo to you for standing up to your brother and for your SIL and your niece. Your brother is the AH here. He seems to forget, having unprotected sex with someone, there are consequences and that resulted in his daughter he doesn't want. He's an asshole, because most people can't have kids and would trade anything to be in his shoes. \n\nHe cheated and doesn't want to be a dad. WTF is he crying about then? He got his way out. He needs to grow up. \n\nI wish you nothing but happiness. You have a good head on your shoulders.", "NTA. Change friends. Your bro is TA af.   \nI just can't believe what weird execuses and reasons man can invent just to cover he had cheated. Yesterday I read about guy who broke up with girl because she \"ate too much during Valentine dinner\" (she can, she has hyperglykemia) and then he admitted he chated (was seeing someone else). But this was only riddiculus excuse, this \"let's put our daughter for adoption...\" \"no way, what's going on?!\" \"whoops...ok... you know, I cheated\" is something like... wtf is wrong with your brother's head? What was he thinking? What EXACTLY ran through his dumb skull when he made up this shit? This is what I always wonder.", "NTA a thousand times! May I point out that: 1. Your brother cheated, which obviously was awful for his ex-wife. 2. He tried to give her up for adoption. 3. Unless you lie, you aren't doing anything other than making sure the truth is heard. You'd be an AH if you didn't tell the truth.\n\n>My brother for so god damn reason thought it would be a great idea to put her up for adoption because he wanted her wife and him to just have fun while they are still young. \n\nTell him you're helping him \"have fun\" by keeping the responsibilities of the child away from him. You're doing everyone, especially your niece, a favour!", "Nta. He wanted to give his daughter up for adoption. It\u2019s better to just let the ex have the child instead", "Your brother's TA.  He's selfish.  His wife deserves to have full custody when he openly said he said wanted to give away his child.  Why wouldn't you tell the truth to the judge, when it's in the best interests of the child? \n\nThere are people that think being relatives excuses horrible behaviors.  They are wrong.  I wonder how much less crime and pain in the world there would be, if families would stop making excuses for the relatives that are selfish jerks, and would hold them accountable.  Your brother didn't just make one mistake, he's made a whole series of them, and all of them are based on his own selfishness.\n\nI think you are right, to put the child first, not your AH brother.", "NTA. You're a hero for supporting this child's best interests. There is no way a person who wanted to adopt out his child should get any kind of custody.", ">My brother for so god damn reason thought it would be a great idea to put her up for adoption because he wanted her wife and him to just have fun while they are still young.\n\n> I told my brother that I was going to court and make sure she gets full custody and that he made his bed and now he can lay on it. \n\nNTA I mean you just gave him what he w\u00e4hrend so I doubt he's upset. I mean he said that at a family dinner. So if this is real he's got everything he wants.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother dishonored his child and his wife.  \n\nIt's jaw dropping that he wanted to give away his toddler daughter so he \"can have fun.\"  And then sulked when your family was horrified.  And then confessed that he had cheated on his wife.\n\nTell THAT to the idiots who seem to think that what your brother did was just leave the toilet seat up habitually and that's why his family situation is what it is.", "NTA. I can't get past the fact that any human being would just offhandedly come up with \"let's put our child up for adoption so wifey and I can have fun while we are young\" type thought process.  His ex wife should be awarded full custody of the child, for her well-being and safety.  She should have his wages garnered for full support until he turns green.  And I can't imagine this person ever having been worthy of admiration or love from anyone.  Scary.", "The fact that multiple people witnessed him saying that he wanted to put the child up for adoption will definitely make a difference in a custody hearing.", "How would she get full custody. Cheating doesn't make you an unfit parent. A comment at the dinner table about adoption doesn't make you an unfit parent either (legally at least).\n\nLet's be happy parents have more rights than that. Otherwise any vindictive spouse can make up nonsense and het full custody.", "His involvement in the situation is helping his brother\u2019s wife in getting custody of his niece. In my opinion, it\u2019s great that he\u2019s helping her out in this.", "The man wanted to put his toddler up for adoption for no reason. Something is not right with his head. The kid and mom definitely need and deserve support from their family and witnesses to the dad's behavior.", "I'd be worried that he'd secretly try to arrange an adoption for her if he had partial custody.", "I doubt it. If he changed his mind what does it matter? Basically unless you\u2019re an unfit parent (and even then) most courts won\u2019t rule against 50/50 custody if you want it.", "My point is the brother has already dug himself a grave. If they want to testify that's great but I don't really think the ex needs their help because brother will continue to make himself look like he's an unfit ah. He's going to crash and burn without their help. Sometimes it's better to just sit back and watch people like that tailspin.", "Everyone is acting like he can just put the child up for adoption, the baby has a mother. Yes, what he said was really crappy. Yes, cheating was really crappy. No, I don't think he should have full custody. Do I think he should get shared custody? That depends, I don't know enough about the guy to say he should never be able to see his child. There simply isn't enough information here for anyone to make that judgement. Do I think the judge is really going to care what OP thinks? No. Judges just look at facts, not feelings and he said/she said. Do I think brother will screw this all up on his own? ABSOLUTLEY. That's why OP just needs to step back and just stop talking to his brother. Support Ex-SIL with childcare and such and let her handle court.", "So would I. Or that he hurts the child because he blames her for his problems.", "I'm pretty sure judges do very much care what witnesses have to say about things that defendants/parties have done or said."]}
