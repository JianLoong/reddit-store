I\u2019m jealous I only have 7. 13 is the goal though.", "Glad you got out, it's absolutely amazing/terrifying what can become normal to you. Sometimes when I look through my memories it's like I'm watching a lazy horror movie, \"No! Stop! OBVIOUSLY you don't walk down the hallway with the flickering lights *towards the hellish shrieking*\" but when I was the person waltzing down the hallway with the flickering lights it felt reasonable.", "It\u2019s a women only event. She should be respectful since she\u2019s a guest not a host.", "She's got serious issues.", "ESH.  Lucy shouldn't have brought a +1. However, if you have the one extra person show up, you tell the caterer, be gracious, and don't miss a beat.  Your duty as hostess is to make everyone feel welcome and included.  Why would you ask someone to leave?  Enjoy your day, even if that means adapting.\n\nBTW - Lucy needs therapy if she can't go to a party with friends without being lonely.  Suspect she has daddy issues.  Try to get her help, but her issues are not your responsibility to own.", "it baffles me anyone attends them lol waste of time and $", "I\u2019m from the south/Midwest and traditional showers for babies and weddings are women only. It\u2019s always been awkward and uncomfy for me. Both events involve two people sharing a big life event so why not celebrate with everyone?", "The fuck they are.", "What part of a baby shower must be all female?", "Big emotions lil guy", "No, just letting you know what is happening here on earth.", "I didn't want to jump to mentally ill but yes, the way she is doing it is not normal. It's not trying it to see what happens or putting up with it to do something your partner loves but maybe you can only find casual enjoyment in. It sounds more like obsession and fear of loss. That she has to become the perfect and only person for X.   \n\n\nIf she will feel \"lonely\" without him at every event then that's a huge dependent red flag. Now I've seen girls that are needy but are ok partners but all around it doesn't look good for lucy. Probably the source of why she switches boyfriends a lot are her strange behaviors. She has a hole to fill too and is afraid to leave it unfilled but that's just my two cents from what i've seen.", "Do what my adopted daughter/niece did. Grabbed my hand and said do not leave my side. \ud83d\ude02 Mom, sister, friend. It will make it easier. And congratulations. \ud83d\ude18", "My baby shower was coed. \n\nMy cousin didn't know any of my friends before he got there, but by the end, he knew exactly who had read *Snow Crash*. Because when you got a bunch of geeks together around 2000, they'd probably talk about books, and he'd recently graduated with a degree in linguistics.", "I'm female and when I have been invited to these things I usually ask the people seated at my table \"So how do you know so and so?\" That usually sparks a conversation.", "I need to know their names and ages and hobbies and if they\u2019re happy. Your username doesn\u2019t quite check out tho \ud83d\ude0a", "Did someone say cats?", "If you are at a shower like this \u201chow do you know the bride or mom to be?\u201d is a good conversation starter.  Then after they answer tell them how you know the person and then ask some follow up questions."]}
