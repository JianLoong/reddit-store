Also, Lucy doesn't have \"emotional issues\" like you've said. We have no reason to believe that based on what we've heard.\n\nLucy never being single isn't a concern, either. Some people want that. It was wrong to superimpose that need at an event where *only* she was invited, not her botytoy.\n\nAt a certain point we need to forego 'benefit of the doubt' and instead think of a thing most of us like to call 'accountability'. Overall, Lucy needs to treat her friends better. Sorry you went through this, OP.\n\nNTA!", "See above. I couldn't careless. That's OP's problem. There's also 43 other NTA, and some of those responses could also be construed as angry. Curious why you choose to engage with me.
