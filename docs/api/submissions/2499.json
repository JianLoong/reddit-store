You need to give him his part of the bill and ask him to honor the agreement. You do also have some ability to be flexible with timing on when he pays you, but you should preserve your rights and set appropriate precedents, especially since this is the first instance. If he balks just say- hey, I can be flexible and let you make payments or whatever, but I'm not willing to set a precedent where we aren't honoring our agreement. I do understand about your other family situations, but I can't be accountable to that at the expense of my child and family, flexibility with timing is what's on offer here.\n\nETA- this could actually work in his favor, him showing that he already has support agreements and costs for his prior child could lessen his permanent obligations to his soon to be ex.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about you or your Ex. It\u2019s about your DD. She has medical needs that both of you are responsible for 50-50. Give him a copy of the bill and ask for the money.

This one is hard and fast easy.  OP take the emotional side out of the equation and simply treat the custody agreement as a business agreement (yes, I know this sounds bad).  Ex made an agreement and signed a contract and should be held to that contract.  Plain and simple.", "NTA. This is his child, he can help to financially support her.

Procedures like that might not strictly be covered under such an agreement because they're usually considered an optional procedure that many people don't get. Even the American Dental Association states they're usually for aesthetic purposes. That's why normal insurance often doesn't cover it.\n\nAnyway, I suppose you could ask him.", "NTA. It\u2019s his part under the agreement. His responsibility.", "NTA I totally understand why you feel guilty about this. I do the same thing, cover co-pay costs, all the little things, it's just easier to handle it myself then asking him for half each time. \n\nThis doesn't seem to be you suddenly enforcing the agreement, it's just the first time there has been a major expense for DD requiring this clause take effect. It's not like you are suddenly asking him to pay for half of past costs. You are asking (telling) him this is the total cost after Insurance (that you/DH pay for) for her orthodoture work and he is responsible for half the out of pocket cost. \n\nYes, the timing seems to suck, but that is not your fault. You are responsible for your daughter and so is her father.

Paying 1/2 of your OOP expenses is part of your Ex's agreement so ask.  He's only an AH if he tries to get out of it.", "Nta.

You could NBTA and talk with him first about it and maybe check with the Orthodontist to see if they have payment plans.
