That angered me more than anything else you said (And the whole post made me mad).  No excuse for any of her behavior, really, but contacting your DD was way over the line.

Your MIL made her choice. Your DH made his. Your MIL attacked your daughter, you have the right to defend her.  \n\nI\u2019m sure her treatment of you and your daughter is just the tip of the iceberg on her behavior through the years. \n\nIf hateful people want to be treated politely they shouldn\u2019t be hateful.", "NTA!!!

You do not have to visit her regardless of circumstances -- if you even remotely liked her, this wouldn't be a post on this sub, so chances are you shouldn't go see her if you have to ask the question.\n\nFor a moment, I was going to suggest your husband go see her, at the very least, when she did seem to open up the invitation to you all. Maybe she realized she didn't prioritize the right things in life and all that jazz. However, since your MIL seemed well enough to type up a barrage of insults on your daughter's Facebook wall, I don't think she needs to see you that bad. How can someone who's dying have that much hate in their heart? Are they not tired? You feel bad because you said something harsh and you seem like a decent person -- a decent person saying the cold, hard truth will feel bad even if it's just the truth. It will pass, the real sadness is the fact that your MIL could have been in your life, your daughter's life and her son's life but actively and continuously chose to not be. \n\nINFO: did you expect your MIL to ever be receptive to you adopting your daughter, regardless of her background? Why do you keep speaking to her, depending on the answer here? For me, it seems like a stretch to think a woman from that generation would be gung-ho about any kind of out-of-family adoption, although I am working from my own cultural background and not yours. Would she have been receptive to another \"stranger's child\" if they were from India or Pakistan?\n\nIMO, had you had a biological child, your MIL would 100% have gotten over the adoption, but you first child would have been second fiddle to the (biological) second. My point being, trying to get this woman to accept your daughter would have been a Sisyphean task in any scenario.", "\"*I draw the line at hurting my DD.*\"  \n\nThis!! 100% this.

She made her bed, she can lie (and die) in it.", "Apologies for the emojis but \u201ca blessing for all that knew her\u201d \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 NTA", "This is the best way to put it, and what I was going to say. NTA but your MIL is a piece of work. \n\nBy the way, I have to give your daughter credit, she knows toxic people are no good, and wants them out of her life...even if they are her Father's family. Good for her!", "My MIL disapproved of our marriage, especially after she heard I couldn't have children. I chose to avoid most contact with her even before we adopted our daughter. We made the decision as parents to severely limit her presence in our lives after she spoke ill of our daughter. My husband spoke to her very rarely and ignored most of her attempts to communicate. \n\nOur religion has different rules regarding adoption than what you'd typically see in Western society. Such things are that an adopted child cannot take the last name of their adoptive parents, cannot inherit, and are not mahram (a family member you cannot marry) unless they breastfeed from their adoptive mother. In other words, you can love them as your own, but they are not viewed as 'yours' in the same way a biological child would be. We are fairly liberal on this matter and disregarded all of this. She has our name (hyphenated), will be the sole inheritor when we pass, and was not breastfed. \n\nMy MIL, on the other hand, is very traditional. I believe that even if we did adopt a child from India or Pakistan, or even if the child were Arab, she'd still have an issue with it. My husband is her only son and she always pressed upon him the importance of him giving her a grandson. Our daughter's background was just another thing that she could pick on to make her seem less ours, and the adoption less acceptable in her eyes.", "Dear daughter, dear husband. Substitute the second initial for a likely relation in this and any similar subs.", " If she had another 10 years you wouldn't have gotten any offers to make amends.", "\"When as asshole dies, they're not suddenly a saint. They're just a dead asshole.\" I might just have to abscond with this one.", "I mean why have they not blocked her? I understand what she did was completely wrong but why stoop to their level? Cut em off and live your life. Honestly I don't care how others solve their problems but I feel causing extra unnecessary drama for yourself is ridiculous.", "If it had been a private message, maybe I'd agree with you. But MIL posted something vile on daughter's facebook wall, which is public. So no. MIL doesn't get the grace of 'turn the other cheek' when she's the one who opened the door and made it public. She's just reaping what she's sown.", "I don't understand why she's even friends with her anyway but again do you. I don't like unnecessary drama in my life but understand some don't mind it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood parenting", "nta, she proved exactly why it was a good thing for you to go nc.", "Karma. She\u2019s getting hers.", "NTA. This is the true pain of being on your last days. You will be confronted by many things, like people not coming to see you one last time as you've done something unforgivable to them. She laid her bed, and now needs to lie in it.", "NTA. She *is* disgusting and you were absolutely justified in defending your daughter.", "What do dd and dh stand for? I see them all the time, but can't figure it out!", "NTA. Sounds like,she will go to her grave being the same bitter vile person she was in life.", "Oooooooof this one hits close to home.\n\n\nNTA. The fact that she spewed hate on your poor daughter's Facebook wall shows exactly who MIL is. If she showed even an ounce of regret, would she not have posted nice things, or at least an apology?", "NTA, you and your husband rock. Forget MIL, she made her bed and now she\u2019s got to sleep in it.", "DH = Dead Husband ???\n\nDD = Designated Driver ???\n\n\nYTA for these confusing initialisms.", ">My MIL somehow found our DD\u2019s Facebook and left a post on her wall, calling her a whole slew of names and saying that she was the reason the family split up. **I responded by saying that no one cared if she passed from her cancer and that the day she did would be a blessing for all that knew her.** I do feel some bit of regret but I draw the line at hurting my DD. My husband has spoken to his mother privately and also expressed his disgust by her actions and said she'd only ever been a mother to him when benefits him. \n\nOn your daughter's Facebook wall? NTA for the rest but that part seems like sort of a bad idea compared to blocking her or reporting the comment.", "NTA, and her absolutely vile public attacks on your daughter prove that you and your husband were right; she hasn\u2019t changed, she\u2019s not apologetic at all, and she was just trying to guilt your husband into a visit. I\u2019m glad you two held your ground and didn\u2019t budge on protecting your daughter, you\u2019re good parents.", "Nta", "INFO\n\nI\u2019m sorry, this might be silly.

But any forgiveness she would have gotten is null and void now that she very publicly attacked the daughter on FB.", "DH - Dear Husband, DD - Dear Daughter, MIL - Mother in Law. \n\nThe subreddit has a character count. I wanted to try and fit what I could without breaking it. It is a bit hard to read though, feels like a constant brain stutter.", "DH is Dear Husband from what I've seen on this subreddit. I think DD is Dear Daughter.", "DH = Dear Husband\n\nDD = Dear Daughter\n\nI think that's correct on the latter, I know it's correct on the former.", "Her husband has chosen not to go. Simple as that. \n\nAlso, he can choose to follow his religion or not.", "Oh no, let's blame OP for her husband's decision not to reunite with his mother. It's almost like her blaming OP's daughter for that same decision.", "I had wondered about that as even Mohamed renounced his adoption over his son. You\u2019ve adopted a kid and removed her father\u2019s name, which is listed as to not do if you take a ward. Seem antithetical to say Mohamed was wrong while Muslim. So in a overarching view I get MIL\u2019a religious objections but get yours from a westerner view \n\nThe name calling and such isn\u2019t good and you\u2019re not the ah  to me but I wonder what answers you\u2019d get with a more Muslim heavy user base", "Agreed, but it was disingenuous to request the invitation when he heard the news, since they were only going to decline if it came anyway. \n\n>One of them informed us of her cancer and asked my DH to come see her. He called her back and said no, he would only be coming when his family was invited.\n\nDefinitely too little too late though, in any case. \n\nI will never understand why people like OP's MIL decide to live like that. It's sad and hurtful for everyone, and so unnecessary.", "She does have her father's name; we felt it would be wrong to change it until she was older and able to choose. At 18 she made the choice to hyphenate her surname, meaning she has her birth name as well as ours. This was her own decision but we support her fully.", "And they probably did block her, after OP told MIL off. Also, they didn't know MIL knew her account until she put that shit on the FB wall.", "They didn't demand an invite. They went no contact with them 16 years ago and haven't looked back. No invite asked for, one given at the last part of MIL's life, and the declination caused her to once again show her true colors.", "But you can't post on their wall if you aren't friends can you? I'm just saying if it was that much of a concern I'd most definitely be making sure they were blocked myself before risking my child going through something like that."]}
