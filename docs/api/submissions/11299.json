That angered me more than anything else you said (And the whole post made me mad).  No excuse for any of her behavior, really, but contacting your DD was way over the line.  You'll probably feel some guilt for your  response, but in reality, nothing you said was untrue.

How dare she call your daughter bases and blame her for splitting up the family that was entirely your MIL doing. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour MIL needs to turn that mirror to herself if she wants to know the reason why her family split up.\n\nIf this rift had only happened a year or two ago, I **might** have a different opinion, but your MIL has had 16+ years to mend fences and apologize for her actions, and it was only when faced with her own mortality that the idea even occurred to her at all - which, given her tirade on your daughter's Facebook, is clearly not even a sincere attempt.\n\nIn any case, I think taking your husband and daughter's lead is important here, and as neither of them have any wish to see her, that's really what matters.\n\nYou reap what you sow.", "NTA\u2026. Your MIL made her choice. Your DH made his. Your MIL attacked your daughter, you have the right to defend her.  \n\nI\u2019m sure her treatment of you and your daughter is just the tip of the iceberg on her behavior through the years. \n\nIf hateful people want to be treated politely they shouldn\u2019t be hateful.", "NTA!!!

You do not have to visit her regardless of circumstances -- if you even remotely liked her, this wouldn't be a post on this sub, so chances are you shouldn't go see her if you have to ask the question.\n\nFor a moment, I was going to suggest your husband go see her, at the very least, when she did seem to open up the invitation to you all. Maybe she realized she didn't prioritize the right things in life and all that jazz. However, since your MIL seemed well enough to type up a barrage of insults on your daughter's Facebook wall, I don't think she needs to see you that bad. How can someone who's dying have that much hate in their heart? Are they not tired? You feel bad because you said something harsh and you seem like a decent person -- a decent person saying the cold, hard truth will feel bad even if it's just the truth. It will pass, the real sadness is the fact that your MIL could have been in your life, your daughter's life and her son's life but actively and continuously chose to not be. \n\nINFO: did you expect your MIL to ever be receptive to you adopting your daughter, regardless of her background? Why do you keep speaking to her, depending on the answer here? For me, it seems like a stretch to think a woman from that generation would be gung-ho about any kind of out-of-family adoption, although I am working from my own cultural background and not yours. Would she have been receptive to another \"stranger's child\" if they were from India or Pakistan?\n\nIMO, had you had a biological child, your MIL would 100% have gotten over the adoption, but you first child would have been second fiddle to the (biological) second. My point being, trying to get this woman to accept your daughter would have been a Sisyphean task in any scenario.", "\"*I draw the line at hurting my DD.*\"  \n\nThis!! 100% this.
