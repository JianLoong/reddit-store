My DH and I are both immigrants. He is Pakistani Muslim. We have been in this country for over 20 years. I am unable to have children but we adopted our DD when she was almost 2. She was my DH\u2019s goddaughter. Her bio parents passed away unexpectedly. \n\nWhen we initially adopted our DD we faced backlash from my DH\u2019s family. My MIL hated the idea of us taking in a \u201cstranger\u2019s child\u201d even though we were very close with her parents. We were told multiple times that she wouldn\u2019t be welcomed or accepted by that side of the family because of her background and who her parents were (they were Cuban/White Catholics). This wasn\u2019t the first time my MIL had given us grief. She didn\u2019t approve of our marriage because I came from a poorer family and was therefore \u2018below\u2019 her son. \n\nWe obliged my MIL and permanently distanced ourselves from anyone who criticized our decision. Our DD\u2019s skin color and origin has no bearing on our love for her. After cutting off my MIL and most of my DH\u2019s family, we struggled without their support. We had almost no contact with them except for my MIL\u2019s passive-aggressive voicemails and letters, all of which completely pretended we didn't have a child. One of them informed us of her cancer and asked my DH to come see her. He called her back and said no, he would only be coming when his family was invited.\n\nOur DD has grown to be an intelligent, well-rounded, and compassionate young woman. We could not be more proud. She struggles with OCD and anxiety but has overcome many obstacles which previously seemed insurmountable. She is 18 and more independent. She lives with us but attends nursing school and is working to save up for a car. The rejection from my DH\u2019s family still hurts her to think about.\n\nWe have just been told that my MIL doesn\u2019t have much time left. She\u2019s extended an invitation to make up and mend bridges. She even invited our daughter. My DH and I declined and are being told we\u2019re terrible people for letting an old woman die without the chance to see her son and grandchild. I responded that she never recognized our DD as her grandchild and that this is her own doing. Our DD has expressed that she has no interest in meeting or seeing my MIL. My husband shares that same sentiment and believes this is just a way for his mother to see him one last time. \n\nMy MIL somehow found our DD\u2019s Facebook and left a post on her wall, calling her a whole slew of names and saying that she was the reason the family split up. I responded by saying that no one cared if she passed from her cancer and that the day she did would be a blessing for all that knew her. I do feel some bit of regret but I draw the line at hurting my DD.

The Facebook abuse shows that she hasn't changed at all. Had you accepted her invite, you would have subjected yourself and your child to abuse.

Never doubt that you did the right thing.", "NTA. \n\nYour MIL doesn't get to pick and choose when it's convenient for her to acknowledge your DD's existence and role in your family. \n\nYour and your husband are amazing people for taking your daughter in and giving her the opportunity to do well, and I'm so glad she had found such an amazing loving home. <3", "NTA it's not your fault her chickens have come home to roost. It sounds like you've been the protector your daughter needs, both of you. Keep being the awesome people you are", "NTA in the slightest. what wonderful parents! <33 Best of love and luck to you three!", "NTA", "NTA. You chose your daughter over a vile manipulative discriminatory woman. You absolutely made the right choice. When she reached out it would have been ok to mend fences or to continue non contact. Both were reasonable choices. Her lashing out at your daughter when she didn\u2019t get her way shows she\u2019s still the evil manipulative woman she\u2019s always been. Sometimes the inevitability of our demise gives us a chance to change for the better. She\u2019s hasn\u2019t done this. She doesn\u2019t deserve you or your family.\n\nThat said, you lashing out after she insulted your daughter may leave you with some undeserved guilt after her passing. What you said was true, but unkind. You will be better off without her, but saying that to her was a bit mean, even if it was deserved.  Go and hug your daughter and reaffirm to her your love and make sure she understands that nothing that evil woman said was true.", "NTA, you knew the type of person she is and she proceeded to show the world by attacking a child.

Sheesh. For MIL to place the blame on a child for her actions is appaling.\n\nPlease continue treating your daughter well. I'm glad that she has such a loving family. \n\nAnd please, have EVERYONE block MIL, and anyone else who spews such hate.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIf she really gave a damn, she'd never have left a post like that. \n\nThis was for appearances for MIL. Nothing more.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s hard to wipe off years of mistreatment in a day, just because the other person is terminal. \n\nPeople want absolution before they pass away so that heaven\u2019s gates will open for them without any barriers. Even in those moments, they are thinking of their soul and not about people they have hurt in their lifetime. Well, doesn\u2019t work that way!", "NTA I was siding with going to see her until that slew of Facebook nastiness. She hasn\u2019t changed, her hate is still strong and whilst it\u2019s tough she made her bed and is going to die with the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nWow. I\u2019m all for mutual reconciliation (emphasis on \u201cmutual\u201d), but contacting your daughter just to heap abuse on her is over the line.

That angered me more than anything else you said (And the whole post made me mad).  No excuse for any of her behavior, really, but contacting your DD was way over the line.
