Honestly that is the best I ever expected it to go but I had pretty much told her that all the things she was saying i had already considered and come to terms with I\u2019m happy it won\u2019t be tense or awkward and I\u2019m not in a state of limbo with my plans.

The threat was already made and i don\u2019t doubt she\u2019ll try and make it again. I hate conflict in general especially with her given she has a \u201crage disorder\u201d she was diagnosed in the late 80\u2019s so i\u2019m sure there is a more proper term for it now but she doesn\u2019t try and control it and it makes the conversations even more difficult", "she would wake up alone at home and then go to my grandparents (her parents) for a casual brunch and gift exchange afterwards go home.

If she has this sort of reaction routinely when you make plans to do something without her approval, that sets a good foundation for you to keep her happy, avoid conflict, and negate yourself.\n\nObviously none of us here know your whole situation, but there's a consistent enough theme in the comments about moving out that I think you should consider it.

I'm not asking you, I'm telling you I will not be here for Christmas. I am in the beginning stages of creating my own life, leaving the nest. I've been invited to do this thing and I want to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. Since I won't be here for Christmas, would you like celebrate after I return and you can hear all about my trip?\"", "NTA. You need to have a plan in case she insists you move out.  \n\nPerhaps you can plan to celebrate Christmas with her on another day. At some point she is going to have to accept that you are creating a life of your own and she will need to share you with others. That includes your time. \n\nBe sensitive that this will be very difficult for her. Talking about your and her feelings is a lot better than name calling. \n\nMy own son (24m) lives in NYC and announced that he will be coming home for labor day weekend because he hates that Xmas and Thanksgiving are so close together. I suspect that means he won\u2019t be coming home for one of them. It will definitely make me sad but it is part of growing up."]}
