I wanted to be clean before chilling all night. However, since like I stated before, I hate being alone. So I locked the door before I went upstairs to shower. \nI came down a few minutes later to an angry bf, who was upset with me for locking the door (bc he had to set down the single bag of food? I think. There may have been a drink too). I was in shock because it\u2019s such a silly thing to be angry over! I always lock the door when I\u2019m alone, as does he! It makes me feel safer in the shower. This led to an argument, and now he told me he doesn\u2019t wanna see me. Aita?

If he did have keys, then he's being a baby.\n\nNTA", "NTA - it's ridiculous of him to be angry at you for being safe. He was mildly inconvenienced and has blown up about it. That's a massive red flag. You might want to throw this fish back in the sea.", "NTA.  I always lock the doors.  Just good practice.  If he doesn't want to see you over *that*, he isn't worth the trouble.  Do not apologize, you need to feel safe.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend went out to get food, and had to unlock the door to get back in like after any normal errand he ran when you\u2019re not there.\n\nYou didn\u2019t lock him out without keys while he was sitting on the front porch.\n\nWhy on earth would anyone shower or sleep or whatever with an unlocked front door?\n\nYeah, yeah, local culture norm whatever.\n\nI just couldn\u2019t do it.", "NTA.\n\nIt takes ten seconds to set food down and open the door with keys.\n\nBy contrast, it takes the rest of your life to get out of a shower dripping wet, throw whatever clothes on that you can, grab the nearest heavy object, and engage in hand-to-hand combat with an armed intruder, which you eventually lose due to the object slipping out of your still-soapy hand, resulting in your death by homicide.", "NTA. Sounds like your boyfriend is being a hypocrite if he also locks the bathroom door when showering and blowing something way out of proportion that I don't really see a reason for being angry about to begin with. Please don't let him gaslight you into apologizing for something that you don't need to apologize for you're definitely not an ah.", "In those ten seconds he wasted putting the food down to use his key he could have used to cure cancer. Thanks a lot. NTA.", "NTA. A slight inconvenience at the sake of you feeling safer while you shower is no reason to break up. Maybe he had some other issues going on and that was just his final straw. Regardless, you having to be on the receiving end of that sucks. Definitely NTA", "NTA. Poor baby had to juggle some packages to unlock the door. How horrible! What would he do if you weren\u2019t home?", "What?? NTA. Locking your front door is a perfectly normal thing to do. I'm flabbergasted that he would be upset about this -- people used to scold me for not taking care of myself if I *didn't* lock my front door. (I don't even live in a bad area.)\n\nMaybe he should just chill out for a second. Having to unlock a door is a perfectly normal burden to cope with. Did he have horrible traffic or something, and he's being unreasonably out of patience?", "NTA. WTF Is wrong with him", "NTA... I think he's just annoyed. Give him 10 minutes and he'll get over it. People are allowed to be annoyed over stupid things.", "NTA. When someone\u2019s case is covered on a true crime doc/podcast SO many people say they don\u2019t lock their doors because it\u2019s just that safe.

You do what makes you feel safe. I am a large man and I lock the doors at night if I am home alone even though I live in a very low crime neighborhood.", "NTA.  You should lock the door when are at home alone.  It sound like this is about more than a locked door.  Why would he threaten to break up with you because you locked the door?  That is a huge over reaction.  Has your relationship been good other than this?", "It\u2019s a good idea to lock the doors. You weren\u2019t wrong maybe he was a little annoyed and you projected? Either way I always lock up before a shit or shower. Let\u2019s say\u2026BTA lol", "NTA - Locking the door when you shower shouldn't lead to an argument. End of story.", "WTF\n\nNTA at all.

There are two exceptions though...when one of leaves and the other is asleep (so the person leaving locks the door or the person taking a nap locks it herself), or when one of is home alone and getting into the shower.\n\nThis also means that sometimes when the person who was out comes back, the door might still be locked even though the other is now up and about and forgot to unlock the door again.

Um, this sounds really disproportionate for what was at most a mild inconvenience for him. I wonder what else is on his mind.", "NTA.  IMO, outer doors should be locked unless there is literally someone going through it.  Anything else just leads to forgetting to lock the door and a potential break-in that's easier than it should be.", "NTA. Why would you only lock the door if you were alone? Doors should always be locked", "NTA, actually I think he should apologize to you.

He's acting like this is a thing you did *to* him, instead of just a thing anyone would do normally that he got mildly inconvenienced by and had a huge overreaction to.\n\nI'd honestly be asking him wtf and if there's something else that bothering him, because giving you the silent treatment because he had to unlock the door is wildly immature.", "NTA. You should always lock your doors.", "NTA. What's up with that dude?", "NTA I thought the issue was the bathroom door was locked and he had issue, realizing its the entry door there's no question it should be locked. Just watch some Americas most wanted you will lock the door everytime", "NTA and y'all should keep a habit of locking the door ANY time you're home or not. It's amazing how many people  WILL try the knob to see if the door is unlocked and walk right in.  I go so far as to lock my door when I'm working in the yard or go to the chicken coop in back. I have a bracelet keyring just for times like that. That's ON TOP OF keeping my front gate locked.  The BF is absolutely not taking basic home and personal safety seriously. I'm not going to say he's the AH because many men do not understand the risks women face, but suggest he read about Richard Chase aka the Vampire of Sacramento. He viewed an unlocked door as an invitation.", "[removed]", "NTA my bf locks the door as soon as he leaves even if I\u2019m home, like why would you not lock the door when someone leaves regardless of whether someone is home or not.", "No. That\u2019s normal when people take showers.

NTA.", "NTA\n\nI once threatened a roomie with grievous bodily harm if anyone broke into our place and my dog got injured because she kept leaving the back door unlocked. \n\nI'm a big time believer in locking of the doors.", "NTA. As a single female in a household, you don't leave doors unlocked when you are in your most vulnerable state.", "Nta but please reconsider a relationship with someone who does not understand how dangerous it is for us women to just exist in this world.", "NTA.

Obviously your bf has never had his home or car broken into or had anything stolen.", "NTA. This is a serious overreaction on your BF's part. Locking the door while you were home alone and taking a shower is a logical safety measure.

Was he getting food just for himself or for both of you? \n\nI don't think you're an AH for it being your initial thought process. But possibly warrants a conversation about each person's personal preference. If I was out grabbing dinner and my partner knew I was going to be back in a short time, I'd probably be a bit miffed if they locked the door and then made themselves unavailable to open it for me, when they could have waited just a few minutes.", "Really hope I'm wrong but this feels like one of those times where a partner manufactures a stupid argument out of the blue so they can go out and cheat.
