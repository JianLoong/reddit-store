If you\u2019re close to her then it would\u2019ve been the right thing to go to support her and show love, but if she\u2019s just your dads Missus then she\u2019s being ridiculous wanting you to go to the funeral of her family members when you\u2019re not even close to her, let alone them.", "Did you inform and explain to them before the funeral that you wouldn't be attending and why? If you did and they chose not to understand then there isn't anything you can do about it. But if you just decided not to show up then it's different. It's not rare for distant relatives to not be able to attend funerals but if we share a decent neutral relationship with someone (not good but not bad either) then we atleast must call and offer our condolences along with the reason for not attending. While a lot of people may say this isn't your obligation but it's family and we all in our way do a lot to maintain peace with family and it can get tricky with step family and all. but again, family isn't about 1 person. So yea, if you did your basic bit then NTA if not then..", "NTA. You barely know the person and you couldn't make it even if you wanted to. Education is your priority, and they well were aware that you won't make it. \"Death should never take precedence over life\".", "Since you had the discussions with her and she knew, NTA.  If you had seen him more often than that and were close, I would say, yeah, maybe you should have gone.\n\nBy the sounds of it, your step-mother had enough support from family members.", "How close are you to the step mom? Do you even like her? \nIf not, fuck it. Who cares. \nIf so, than yeah, you\u2019re an asshole.", "OMG! Why do people feel like they are wrong for stepping up for themselves? NTA! You have a life. And guess what? That's what blocking is for on social media.", "INFO we need more info about your relationship with your step mom. How close are you to her? How long has she been your step mum? How involved was she in your upbringing? How does she behave towards you - do you have a good relationship with her?\n\nIt\u2019s ok to skip lectures and travel for 1h to go to a funeral", "NAH This was your choice to make. Unless you have a bad relationship with your stepmom I would have made another choice. It doesn\u2019t really matter how often you met him. You\u2019d attend to support your stepmom and her family. Yet you\u2019re not an asshole for prioritizing your education. But she\u2019s not wrong either for feeling hurt because you didn\u2019t want to skip class for one day to support her.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you go to the funeral of someone you don't know. \n\nSounds like this woman has delusions of being your mother and probably thinks you should see her dad as a grandfather.\n\nBlock her and all her relatives.", "Funerals are for the living, not the dead. If the person is close to someone you care about, you should make every attempt to go. Small YTA. You could have asked someone to take notes. Not going says you do not care about your step-mom.", "The decision about whether or not to go to a funeral often has nothing to do with how well you knew the deceased. It's about showing your love and support for the other people in your life who are mourning that person. \n\nIf that support is something your stepmom wants and expects from you, then YTA for not going. If your relationship with her is significantly more distant than that, it may be a different story.", "Sound like a whole lot of fuckery, I don\u2019t think YTA but funerals are not fun regardless.", "ESH. You should have gone. It was to support your step-mother and your father, they needed your support. You should have made an effort. Your stepmother sux for airing your private family drama on social media and not coming to talk to you privately like an adult. Her family sux for bullying you.", "YTAH- even if you never met him, you should go out of respect to your step mother.", "You\u2019re an hour away and couldn\u2019t find a time to come by to show support to your family?  You come across as entirely self-absorbed.  YTA", "YTA.  It\u2019s not about going to a funeral of someone you don\u2019t know.  It\u2019s about going to a funeral to support someone you DO know (step-mom).  Her father died and your absence (without an adequate excuse) says \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d  That\u2019s why they\u2019re upset with you.", "YTA. This is dad. How could you", "ESH.  Funerals aren't for the dead, they're for the living.  You're presumably somewhat close with your step mom, and the idea is to be there for her.  Her reaction was also inappropriate which is why this gets the ESH.  it's one day of class and an hour drive, yta for not going.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You had more important things to do instead of going to a strangers funeral.", "NTA. If they want everyone to attend, they don\u2019t have the funeral on a weekday, in the middle of the day.", "Info: If you made it clear that you could not attend and did not receive any push back, then NTA. The funeral is for the living, so the important thing is that you made an effort for your stepmom (what \"effort\" means really depends on the situation)\n\nRegardless, it is very uncool of your stepmom to rant about you on social media.", "NTA\n\nYour dad's marriage is not your problem.\n\nIf your step mom is threatening to cut you off, and giving your dad a hard time, Im betting things were not so great before this.\n\nUnless, her extended family is somehow supporting you, ignore them and focus on your class work. Im sure her late father would tell you to stay in school and get good grades, not to waste the money being spent on you.", "NTA\n\neven if it was your own dad and you were not busy but just didn't want to go, you wouldn't be TA. \nSome people are obsessed with going to funerals. \nYou pay respect to the DEAD person, not their living relatives. \nAnd you are also free to decide on your own if you want to go or not.", "NTA life goes on even if person x that you saw ages ago dies \n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: i personally skipped more funerals than i attended, because i havent seen those people since my grandma died in 2002. who the heck cares about a alcoholic uncle that hasnt talked to you in 20+ years", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that your mother in law is being so childish to post about you online.  That\u2019s really upsetting. She\u2019s hurting\u2026 but it\u2019s no excuse.\nYour dad and step mums marriage won\u2019t break over this and if it did, it\u2019s not really because of this. Hope you are ok\u2026", "NTA. It is your own decision whether you want to go to a funeral or not. But the fact that you'd only met him 3 times is really irrelevant. We go to funerals to support the living, not the dead. I am quite convinced that the dead couldn't care less.", "Nope!", "NTA it\u2019s weird a grown adult is blasting her step son on Facebook.", "No not the Asshole.\n\nWhy would you go to a funeral for someone you do not know? I sure wouldn't.\nI don't want to go into a funerals for people I know.", "Definitely NTA - you are not obligated to go to anyone's funeral you don't want to. You are also not obligated to give a reason why. I didn't go to my own father's funeral because he was an asshole who cut me out of his life 30 years prior. Your step mom was and still is abusive towards you. You don't owe her anything.", "Block them all. Who are they to you anyway? I'm always amazed at how relative strangers feel they have the right to bombard someone having access to only half the story. And how that said someone doesn't instantly block the abuse when it starts. I remember having a conversation with an ex about how he doesn't have to open a door when someone knocks, if he doesn't feel like it. He was blown away by the concept.", "Yeah I told them last week multiple times that I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend", "She was abusive towards me when I was younger", "Yeah it boils down to whether he actually cares about the people who suffered this loss.", "Are you that blind, the step mom wanted it about her and thats all this is about. Even with your reasoning, why would he even be an ah in the slightest, step mom and a person he didnt know", "Why would you expect OP to provide support to someone who was abusive to them. The correct answer would be for OP to run in the opposite direction.", "So respect for someone who was abusive to OP. Did you even read OPs post?", "I\u2019m not close to her. She\u2019s abusive", "Funerals in the UK are held Monday to Friday as a general rule. Don't know about church ones though.", "NTA. They're angry and emotional and looking for outlets for the anger. Not fair to you, but NTA.", "Then because of that & her stunningly immature social media rant to incite others to bully you - NTA!", "So you don't have a good relationship with her and you barely know her father.  You are definitely NTA and I'm puzzled why, in those circumstances, that they would even expect you to attend. Keep studying.  Getting a good qualification will be your escape route to a decent job and a chance to get away from Stepmother completely."]}
