And it's sketchy he misdelivered to your house and then called you. So many questions and not a lot of good answers.", "How did the guy have your number if you dodnt order?", "I would call the restaurant and talk to the boss. The delivery driver might be trying to scam you and boss should know that he 1)mis-delivered the order, looked in the restaurant\u2019s system for your address and phone number and called you wanting you to pay for something that was his mistake", "NTA, it\u2019s a health issue if the delivery person takes the food back.  Most restaurants just allow where the food was delivered to keep it, paid or not paid for. It\u2019s most probably also illegal, depending on your state for the restaurant owner to charge the delivery driver for the mistake made.", "NTA, are you serious? It\u2019s not your order, end of story.", "It wasn\u2019t your order or your mistake. NTA.

The restaurant would not take it back anyway as risk of contamination\n\nHitting you up to pay for it is complete BS. Usually if something like this happens, I'll usually try calling them directly. The driver should have also shown to confirm the actual address", "NTA - customer price does not equal company cost, even if the kid had to pay employer probably gave him a deal, employee meal or cost price, if anything.  Mistake happen, that\u2019s why you pay $50 for $10 worth of food.  Well, one of the reasons anyway. How do I know, restaurant work 25 years.", "My son accepted it.

Driver shouldn't have had their phone number to contact them.\n\nThis seems likely either a scam or stalking thing. I'd probably make a complaint to the company about it", "It's a pretty involved and high risk scam to leave $50 dollars worth of food at someones house. They would lose money if they are trying to scam $25 dollars out of OP, and if they are trying to steal OPs financial info, there are plenty of safe ways to send 25 dollars.", "I asked him that via text, but he never answered. He knew my name and address from having delivered to our house many times before. The restaurant probably had that info. They use their own drivers, not ones from GrubHub or UberEats.", "You have to give a number for most deliveries, so they can contact you with any issues/delays/etc. At least, that was the norm as of last time I ordered takeout!

The restaurant probably had the rest of my info. I asked him via text how he got my number but he never said.", ">My son accepted it.\n\nAs in the delivery guy gave it to him? Did your son pay for it, or did the delivery guy let him take the food without paying?", "Uber Eats always has my cell.", "\"From your usual place\"\n\nCall the store directly and confirm about the order.

I completely misread this.", "Yeah I completely misread it.", "Oh ok definitely NTA food delivery is one of the easiest jobs around with maps attached to everyone\u2019s phone.the driver is just lazy", "Sounds like the delivery guy took it to the wrong house, he handed it over to the person who answered.

I have no idea where it was meant to go.", "That\u2019s exactly right. Whoever ordered it had already paid for it, so my son just took the bag thinking it was me who had ordered it (I wasn\u2019t home at the time).", "Sure, but if they didn't order the meal, they wouldn't have their phone number or contact info.", "Ah, makes sense!", "That\u2019s still the delivery guys error.
