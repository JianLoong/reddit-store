Actually i think what happened here is a poor delivery driver requesting you money because he is afraid what will be the repercussions\r of his mistake. Many restaurants warn their delivery drivers that they should pay for the food if they make a wrong delivery. And many of them also charge that too. But in normal cases, this is just a warning policy to keep them concentrated on the correct delivery. The manager has let this go since he realized you are a regular customer and the driver made a honest mistake. The driver may only requested the amount before he has informed the manager about the situation. When he realized he will not be charges for anything, he has dropped the request.\n\nAnyhow please keep in mind that you are not required to pay in any of these situations. If  they have wrongfully delivered the order, they have the option to collect it back or give them to you for free (which actually happens a lot).

Our apartment complex is set up like a dumbass. The development is split across a public street half on X street and half of Y street. They named their buildings street Y building 101 apartment 101 and then on the other side they have street X building 101 apartment 101. I was able to explain the error to the delivery driver but sheesh. Anyway I wouldn\u2019t pay. It wasn\u2019t your order and any number of things could cause your son to grab the bag accidently. You didn\u2019t pay or sign for anything", "The red flag here is there was no valid reason to have your number. You didn't order anything, so he shouldn't even been able to contact you via app.\n\nHe got it somehow, and frankly, if he's claiming to bring his \"boss'\" into it, the place deserves to know if the driver is running something behind their back\n\nChances are good you're not the only person", "There was not receipt and the bagging wasn't recognizable to you, from a place you supposedly order from a lot. This is super suspicious, you should be able to tell where the food is from if it's from a place you're a regular at.\n\nThis is almost definitely a scam, and even if he was desperate him getting your number from the system is a problem. Call the restaurant, get the manager, I'm almost certain they have no idea what's going on. Even if everything you've been told is somehow true, he should not be contacting you and the manager needs to know he's saving contact info and contacting people personally.", "The name associated with the order was probably similar to yours,  so the delivery guy, rushed and busy, brought it to you by mistake. He probably looked up your number in their system once the actual customers called to ask where their order was.", "I try to believe everything I read on reddit (cause otherwise, what's the point?) but that totally set off my bullshit detector.", "If you order from a restaurant they usually have your contact - op wrote they often Order from this restaurant so they do have op s number", "OP often orders from this place so they know her. The mistake probably happened between addresses, it might have had the other person\u00b4s phone number on the receipt but when the delivery guy figured out his mistake it would be easy for him to pair OP\u00b4s phone number with her address and then contact her. I do not understand why that is so difficult to believe or understand.", "If this is in the US and the delivery driver works for the restaurant, not a food delivery company, I do not believe it\u2019s legal to make make him pay for the food since it was a mistake and a cost of doing business, I could be wrong but in general, companies can\u2019t dock an employee for an error.  Especially if the error results in the employee earning less than min wage.", "There are plenty of restaurants that make the wait staff pay for someone who skips out on the bill.  That whole dine and dash thing.  There was one many years back in my state where this waitress ran out to try and get the customers to either pay or get their license plate and was hit by the car.  Because she knew it would be docked from her pay.  and she couldnt aford some 200.00 our of her pay."]}
