My bf Cameron asked me to over a month ago and I just moved everything out of my former place today. \n\nI have a dog, Sammy, who is 9 years old. I rescued him when he was around 2 and he\u2019s seen me through some really rough things. I was in an abusive relationship for a while that also really affected him. That ended two years ago and it\u2019s been just Sammy and I since then. \n\nCameron has a dog as well. She\u2019s a large breed (around 60 pounds where Sammy is around 30). She\u2019s just over three and he rescued her when she was just under a year old. She had sometimes slept in his room with him, but mostly in a crate. My dog has never slept in a crate, I don\u2019t disagree with that method of training at all, but I\u2019d be unwilling to force that on my dog, now that he\u2019s so old. \n\nI go to bed before my boyfriend and the last two nights he\u2019s been coming to bed and locking my dog out of the room. He\u2019d mentioned, prior to doing this, thinking about not having my dog sleep in the room, and every time he brought it up, I expressed my discomfort. My dog and I have been through some rough things and he\u2019s never not slept near me. \n\nTonight, I stayed up much later with boyfriend while he played on the computer. We went to go to bed and he tried to lock my dog out and I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. He said my dog affected his allergies and makes weird mouth noises that we\u2019re keeping him awake (his dog is not hypoallergenic). I said I respected that he needed sleep, I wanted to try to solve this issue when it wasn\u2019t nearly midnight, and that I\u2019d like to either sleep on the couch with my dog nearby or sleep with the door open until we could have a proper conversation. He was really upset by this and told me both options were \u201ccrap.\u201d I asked him for compromises and he didn\u2019t have any. He then walked out while I was mid sentence to sleep in his guest room (strictly no dogs allowed in that room). \n\nI don\u2019t know what I did wrong. I know I can be overprotective of my dog. Am I being unreasonable? I was trying to help. \n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend is allergic to my dog and instead of sleeping in the same room I offered to sleep on the couch\n\nEdit: I\u2019d been at his home basically every night for the previous month and a half with my dog and he\u2019d never not slept in the room - I didn\u2019t think it was something for us to discuss. I also know he\u2019s allergic (I can tell when it gets worse), I think it\u2019s just a very mild reaction. I was hoping to talk to him about brushing/bathing more regularly\n\nEdit 2: as clarification, I don\u2019t need my dog to sleep IN the bed, just in the same room. Sammy typically just sleeps near me.", "created_utc": 1677746521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fxpb6/aita_for_sleeping_downstairs_when_my_boyfriend/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I honestly doubt that he actually is allergic to your dog (and somehow not his?) and only uses this as a cheap excuse for his own preferences. However, both sides are understandable, wanting and not wanting a dog in the bedroom while sleeping. I know people who love their dogs with all their heart but wouldnt allow them to sleep in the bedroom with them. Doesnt necessarily mean they dont like dogs, its just a preference. I'd say, especially since youve only been together for 6 months, you need to decide for yourself if thats something you are willing to sacrifice for this relationship or not.

There is no way we would have rehomed them after finding out because they are 100% family, so we are just managing the symptoms while the cats still get to live a long and happy life. We just won't get any new pets in the future.  \n\n\nIf he knew about his dog allergy before getting a dog, got one anyway AND had a second dog move in as well....I guess he doesn't mind his allergy that much.  \nPersonally, I don't find anything wrong with sleeping in separate rooms if one of the rooms is kept pet free and he can have better sleep there. Then OP can sleep near her dog in the other room. Sleeping separately doesn't have to be a negative thing if it results in better sleep and mental health for everyone involved (including OP's elderly dog).", "So I have to ask the question, did you ever sleep over at each other's places prior to moving in together?

Hell, different fur types.", "\"You can suffer allergies, or I can withdraw companionship and affection\" is quite the set of choices.", "Of course there is. But at the start of a relationship it just seems a bit weird to me, having slept next to the same woman for 25 odd years.", "Lol reaching once again. You can take one of my comments out of context to save your ass, but you're still an asshole friend. How about you tell the people the second half of that comment where I said \"most women would be thankful (to have a husband who paid for everything and allowed her to save her salary)\"", "You're assuming she didn't know her BF had allergies. Nothing she wrote implied that he told her after the fact. YOU chose to misinterpret what she wrote to fit your own narrative.", "Yea, for some reason I\u2019m fine around Golden retrievers, but labs, German Shepherds, and Rottweilers will all set my allergies going.", "The compromise doesn't have to be long term, like OP said, she'd like to come up with a better one but not AT bedtime when emotions might run high.\n\nThis man also has a dog that he occasionally lets sleep in his bed as well, I would like to point out.\n\nIf you think moving to another sleeping area temporarily while you figure out a problem is withdrawing companionship and affection, that says a whole lot more about YOU and your ideas than it does on the actual situation at hand.", "Well who are you to tell someone else how to conduct their relationship. Not everyone likes sharing a bed, and that's ok.", "Throwing insults now, big big incel energy. I doubt you know what real life women would be thankful for", "So just to confirm he goes to sleep on the couch because they are not going to make a decision and this makes him the AH, and she says she will sleep on the couch because they aren't going to make decision, but thats ok  and would still make him the AH.\n\nThe hypocrisy is breathtaking here.\n\nAnd the dog doesn't sleep on his bed occasionally, it used to a few times and now  doesnt ( presumable he has found he has allergies  which she confirms he has).  \nSo his choice is get allergies or sleep apart and he is the AH which ever he picks. Certainly no misandry there!!", "Jesus Christ what\u2019s with the aggression? \n\nI\u2019m not telling anyone how to do anything. The sub is called am I the asshole. People post here to get other people\u2019s opinions and viewpoints on their situation. I\u2019m not even saying the op is in the wrong. I can see where she\u2019s coming from, but I can also see her partner\u2019s point of view in wanting her to sleep in the same bed as him.\n\nMy giant-breed dog sleeps on and off my bed during the night. I\u2019ve been allergic to dogs since I was 17, but found that exposure to the same dog lessens it to almost nothing. As long as my dog doesn\u2019t lick me I\u2019m fine. Same with my parents dog who I see every day and stays with us when the go in holiday. But a strange dog brings me out in a rash, eyes watering, nose running and blocked at the same time.", "I don't think he's an asshole for sleeping in the guest room, nor would he be an asshole if OP went and slept on the couch. He's an asshole because he's throwing a temper tantrum about it at midnight. Your victim complex seems over the top.", "Except he's they are having this discussion at midnight (when he needs to be up for work the next day and sleeping with the dog will making that difficult)  instead of her bringing it up after noticing he locks her dog out of the bedroom.  This was a known issue between them and both just assumed they were going to get their own way.", "How did he through a temper tantrum?  He left the conversation because there was no point talking about it at midnight, which is exactly what she proposed doing? she has left him with no option but to do that. If she was aggrieved about the situation that occurred the previous nights, the best idea would have been to bring it up much earlier. she didn't and than says it is too late to talk about it.\n\nI haven't got a victim complex, I have dogs and am happy for them to sleep in my bed or mu couch, but if she had an issue with it (especially a medical issue) I would talk about it to her earlier and accept her reasoning until I could.\n\nI know you want to find him guilty but you make yourself look like a clown, calling him AH for things they are both doing and the simple fact is he has more reason to have his way than she does.", "OP offered to go sleep on the couch and talk the issue out later. BF decided to put himself out and get all worked up. Yes it's a known issue on both parts but OP was willing to be the person that was put out, she's owning her part in that nights conflict even if not in the whole of the conflict. What else would you have her do in the moment other than completely acquiesce?", "According to OP, he was really upset and said both options were crap after SHE offered to go sleep on the couch. THAT is him throwing a temper tantrum. She offered to be the one put out at the situation, he got indignant and pouted in his guest room.\n\nBoth of them should have spoken about this ahead of time, yes. It was poor planning. Throwing a fit and bouncing to another room because you didn't get your way does not bode well for this relationship though and if I were OP and saw this I would be looking for a way out because it suggests that anytime BF doesn't get his way he'll flounce.\n\nI'm not worried about looking like a clown, I'm apparently being drowned out by people that can't think critically about emotional reactions and instead blames misandry.", "The simple statement of \"both options are crap\" is not a tantrum. Being emotionally distant is almost the exact opposite of a tantrum which is defined by emotional outburst.", "well one of the options was he suffer with allergies and the other was her them sleeping apart, so he actually picked her second option.\n\nYes I agree with you that they both should have spoken about it and maybe I am being a bit unthinking to wonder how they didn't realise before (my assumption being that couples have already slept together before moving in- but that is obviously up to the individuals involved and no judgement either way).  \nThe issue I think though is that she  had the issue with it,  she has moved into his house and this is the way he does things and more importantly what has occurred since she moved in. This being the case  it is her needs to say I don't want to this situation either in the morning or during the day, when they can discuss it. Bringing it up at midnight, saying its too late to talk about it and than offering 'one option' that he can't possible accept, is not being fair.\n\n **I'm apparently being drowned out by people that can't think critically about emotional reactions and instead blames misandry**.\n\nNo dont rewrite things- people are not having emotional reactions.  The OP and her partner both have the same second option ( sleeping apart). For some reason you believe he is the AH whilst she is not, and the only difference is the gender of the people involved."]}
