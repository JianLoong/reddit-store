My bf Cameron asked me to over a month ago and I just moved everything out of my former place today. \n\nI have a dog, Sammy, who is 9 years old. I rescued him when he was around 2 and he\u2019s seen me through some really rough things. I was in an abusive relationship for a while that also really affected him. That ended two years ago and it\u2019s been just Sammy and I since then. \n\nCameron has a dog as well. She\u2019s a large breed (around 60 pounds where Sammy is around 30). She\u2019s just over three and he rescued her when she was just under a year old. She had sometimes slept in his room with him, but mostly in a crate. My dog has never slept in a crate, I don\u2019t disagree with that method of training at all, but I\u2019d be unwilling to force that on my dog, now that he\u2019s so old. \n\nI go to bed before my boyfriend and the last two nights he\u2019s been coming to bed and locking my dog out of the room. He\u2019d mentioned, prior to doing this, thinking about not having my dog sleep in the room, and every time he brought it up, I expressed my discomfort. My dog and I have been through some rough things and he\u2019s never not slept near me. \n\nTonight, I stayed up much later with boyfriend while he played on the computer. We went to go to bed and he tried to lock my dog out and I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. He said my dog affected his allergies and makes weird mouth noises that we\u2019re keeping him awake (his dog is not hypoallergenic). I said I respected that he needed sleep, I wanted to try to solve this issue when it wasn\u2019t nearly midnight, and that I\u2019d like to either sleep on the couch with my dog nearby or sleep with the door open until we could have a proper conversation. He was really upset by this and told me both options were \u201ccrap.\u201d I asked him for compromises and he didn\u2019t have any. He then walked out while I was mid sentence to sleep in his guest room (strictly no dogs allowed in that room). \n\nI don\u2019t know what I did wrong. I know I can be overprotective of my dog. Am I being unreasonable? I was trying to help. \n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend is allergic to my dog and instead of sleeping in the same room I offered to sleep on the couch\n\nEdit: I\u2019d been at his home basically every night for the previous month and a half with my dog and he\u2019d never not slept in the room - I didn\u2019t think it was something for us to discuss. I also know he\u2019s allergic (I can tell when it gets worse), I think it\u2019s just a very mild reaction. I was hoping to talk to him about brushing/bathing more regularly\n\nEdit 2: as clarification, I don\u2019t need my dog to sleep IN the bed, just in the same room. Sammy typically just sleeps near me.", "created_utc": 1677746521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fxpb6/aita_for_sleeping_downstairs_when_my_boyfriend/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the only thing keeping you from being the asshole. \n\nYou're not compromising at all. Both dogs should be treated somewhat similar. Your BF respects your wishes of not wanting to kennel your dog, so he only keeps it out of the bedroom so he can at least sleep without his allergies being too crazy 24/7.

Honestly, if he can change his mind about having the dog in the bedroom, you can change your mind over moving in. I would never choose a man over my loyal companion, who has been there through thick and thin.\n\nI think you two need to have a serious conversation, one where you wont allow him to walk away, and you need to figure out something. Maybe the solution is that you two just are not compatible to live together.", "This is not a AITA situation. But if I were the male here... i would ask u and ur dog to kick rocks. Seems like the move in was very premature.", "NTA, you offered compromises to get through the situation and he opted to be a child and just walk out. That said, this is probably something that really should've been settled before you moved in with him.", "NTA\n\nHow does he have a dog when he has allergies?\n\nIt sounds like you barely discussed anything moving in related before you moved in. You both have different expectations but your nf is T A, because he just wanted his way and was unwilling to compromise.", "Ask your landlord if they still have your apartment available. Cause you might have to move back in - you guys are not ready - tbh you moved in too quickly.\n\nYour already arguing about the setup of your dogs and sleeping arrangements. If this bothers him this much, it\u2019s not going to blow over, no matter how much you argue about it.\n\nYou should have communicated this before the move. \n\nMajor red flag - Him walking away mid-sentence is a asshole move.

My senior rescue cats sleep on my head and chest and sometimes face and I wouldn't have it any other way. Come Hell or High Water.

You offered to sleep on the sofa. He balked. Meh.

He loves you more than any human is capable of.", "NAH. You\u2019re both trying to make 30 years of individual habits mesh together as a cohabitation. There will be many adjustments needed on both sides. I wholeheartedly agree with your decision to wait until a reasonable hour to discuss the situation. Pure guess from a guy\u2019s perspective: Maybe he overreacted because he felt you were sleeping apart from him as punishment or something. (Withholding affection). I do not believe that that was your intention, but in his tired state he may have taken it that way.", "YTA. I have a dog myself who used to sleep with me some and had him during an abusive relationship as well but that doesn't give me an excuse to go to a different room and pout because I can't do that anymore living with my husband who has never had a house dog and doesn't prefer them to be on furniture. I just crate him at night and everything is fine.", "NTA. My dog has been with me 14 years. And thru an abusive relationship as well. He sleeps by my feet every night. My boyfriend loves him and understands. Is he over the moon about it. No. But is he gonna be a brat and lock my dog out of the room...no. We communicated early on..he knew about it ..he said he didn't really like it...but was cool with it cause it's a king size bed and my dog is at my feet ..I don't really like how your bf handled this ..but anyway good luck.", "NTA - Thats a tough situation though.. I honestly doubt that he actually is allergic to your dog (and somehow not his?) and only uses this as a cheap excuse for his own preferences. However, both sides are understandable, wanting and not wanting a dog in the bedroom while sleeping. I know people who love their dogs with all their heart but wouldnt allow them to sleep in the bedroom with them. Doesnt necessarily mean they dont like dogs, its just a preference. I'd say, especially since youve only been together for 6 months, you need to decide for yourself if thats something you are willing to sacrifice for this relationship or not. And ask him the same question, because in these kinds of situations it goes both ways.", "You pick sleeping with your dog over sleeping with your boyfriend.

The AUDACITY to walk out of the room mid sentence and then go to the \u201cdog free zone\u201d to get away from it. Petty as hell too.

I'm now MARRIED to my husband and he still complains he gets a shit sleep with my 3 dogs in the room snoring and farting but I explained we are a package deal and if you don't like it sleep somewhere else because I'm not separating from them.

Maybe it's similar to that.", "I didn\u2019t know he was doing it. When he came to bed, I was already asleep", "It's not pouting, it's looking after a dog that's always been there with her.

ESH, moving in together should have been tabled until it was resolved, especially if the bf is allergic.", "I agree. The owner of said older dog should have brought that up before moving in.", "To be fair, my partner found out about his cat allergy several years after adopting our cats because the allergy developed over time due to exposure. There is no way we would have rehomed them after finding out because they are 100% family, so we are just managing the symptoms while the cats still get to live a long and happy life. We just won't get any new pets in the future.  \n\n\nIf he knew about his dog allergy before getting a dog, got one anyway AND had a second dog move in as well....I guess he doesn't mind his allergy that much.  \nPersonally, I don't find anything wrong with sleeping in separate rooms if one of the rooms is kept pet free and he can have better sleep there. Then OP can sleep near her dog in the other room. Sleeping separately doesn't have to be a negative thing if it results in better sleep and mental health for everyone involved (including OP's elderly dog).", "So I have to ask the question, did you ever sleep over at each other's places prior to moving in together? And if so what was the dog situation then?", "Oh so he waited until he thought you couldn't say no. Time to look for another place or see if you can get your old place back.", "Honey he is trying to force you to stop sleeping with your dog without discussing it before moving in. This is a power trip. I would reconsider all together, he didn't had this discussion earlier because he planed to corner you once you moved and make you cave in instead of having a discussion about it.", "r/woosh", "There is so much more to being a couple than just sleeping in the same bed. \n\nI slept in the same bed with my husband for over 18 years. He has sleep apnea, talks in his sleep, restless legs, you name it. He wears a CPAP which he's always taking off and adjusting etc. I think the only reason we made it that long is bc I'm a very deep sleeper. \n\nAfter I had cancer surgery and became disabled I began sleeping in my own room. It's heavenly and I will never go back to sharing a bed with my husband bc I earned this bed lol. We will be together until one of us dies.", "So the couples who can't sleep together bc of e.g. different work schedules are not couples worth living together?
