My bf Cameron asked me to over a month ago and I just moved everything out of my former place today. \n\nI have a dog, Sammy, who is 9 years old. I rescued him when he was around 2 and he\u2019s seen me through some really rough things. I was in an abusive relationship for a while that also really affected him. That ended two years ago and it\u2019s been just Sammy and I since then. \n\nCameron has a dog as well. She\u2019s a large breed (around 60 pounds where Sammy is around 30). She\u2019s just over three and he rescued her when she was just under a year old. She had sometimes slept in his room with him, but mostly in a crate. My dog has never slept in a crate, I don\u2019t disagree with that method of training at all, but I\u2019d be unwilling to force that on my dog, now that he\u2019s so old. \n\nI go to bed before my boyfriend and the last two nights he\u2019s been coming to bed and locking my dog out of the room. He\u2019d mentioned, prior to doing this, thinking about not having my dog sleep in the room, and every time he brought it up, I expressed my discomfort. My dog and I have been through some rough things and he\u2019s never not slept near me. \n\nTonight, I stayed up much later with boyfriend while he played on the computer. We went to go to bed and he tried to lock my dog out and I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. He said my dog affected his allergies and makes weird mouth noises that we\u2019re keeping him awake (his dog is not hypoallergenic). I said I respected that he needed sleep, I wanted to try to solve this issue when it wasn\u2019t nearly midnight, and that I\u2019d like to either sleep on the couch with my dog nearby or sleep with the door open until we could have a proper conversation. He was really upset by this and told me both options were \u201ccrap.\u201d I asked him for compromises and he didn\u2019t have any. He then walked out while I was mid sentence to sleep in his guest room (strictly no dogs allowed in that room). \n\nI don\u2019t know what I did wrong. I know I can be overprotective of my dog. Am I being unreasonable? I was trying to help. \n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend is allergic to my dog and instead of sleeping in the same room I offered to sleep on the couch\n\nEdit: I\u2019d been at his home basically every night for the previous month and a half with my dog and he\u2019d never not slept in the room - I didn\u2019t think it was something for us to discuss. I also know he\u2019s allergic (I can tell when it gets worse), I think it\u2019s just a very mild reaction. Prior to this when it seemed to be getting worse, we just knew it was time to wash the sheets, vacuum and dust. I was hoping to talk to him about brushing/bathing more regularly in a longer discussion the next day. \n\nEdit 2: as clarification, I don\u2019t need my dog to sleep IN the bed, just in the same room. Sammy typically just sleeps near me. He\u2019s also 9 and has really slowed down in the last year which makes me constantly aware of the fact that I may not have much time left with him.", "created_utc": 1677746521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fxpb6/aita_for_sleeping_downstairs_when_my_boyfriend/", "score": 347, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I honestly doubt that he actually is allergic to your dog (and somehow not his?) and only uses this as a cheap excuse for his own preferences. However, both sides are understandable, wanting and not wanting a dog in the bedroom while sleeping. I know people who love their dogs with all their heart but wouldnt allow them to sleep in the bedroom with them. Doesnt necessarily mean they dont like dogs, its just a preference. I'd say, especially since youve only been together for 6 months, you need to decide for yourself if thats something you are willing to sacrifice for this relationship or not.

His dog sleeps in his bedroom in a crate.", "\nI assume you didn\u2019t read the bit where he\u2019s allergic to the dog? \n\nCrap is the least offensive word in the English language, unless you were raised as a Mormon.", "I was just reacting to why his dog is not problem even though it is not hypoalergennic.", "I was just reacting to why his dog is not problem even though it is not hypoalergennic.", "I've got it same with my cats.", "Maybe? I think it\u2019s also the oiliness of their coat?", "What does the allergy have to do with anything? The dog was not going to sleep in the boyfriends room. \n\nI think crap is a very offensive word, especially when being used to describe someone else\u2019s effort, whom you supposedly care about. \n\nBut we can agree to disagree there.", "It\u2019s rather peculiar to judge the human race according to the makeup of dogs.", "People like you make me uneasy. Dogs can be vicious, messy, mean, and difficult.", "\"The bf's allergies are his own responsibility to make sure they are not exacerbated, which he did not do.\" .. What a stupid thing to say. That is exactly what he is doing.", "It was\u2026\n\nOption 1, hurts her: she leaves him to sleep by himself to be with the dog, thus making her sleep on a couch\n\nOption 2, hurts him: she stays with him, and the dog is allowed in the room, which will set off his allergies whilst he\u2019s trying to sleep.", "I know how I feel when I see a dog, if someone feels dislike or revulsion in the same situation then their mind is alien to me. I can't predict what kind of moral choices a person like that might make.", "Nothing wrong with disliking a dangerous dog, but most dogs are not dangerous or vicious, so using that to generalize the whole species is unrealistic.", "No, he is not. Only he can determine the severity of his allergies and if they were such an obstacle it should have been one of the first things he laid down as a ground rule when he invited her to live with him a month before. He did not. He allowed the dog in his bed for a month and a half and said nothing. And waited until she had no other option and was already moved in. And responded to her reasonable request of delaying it until they had had more sleep by proclaiming it \"crap\". So, it remains NTA for me.", "She was trying to figure something out. BF stormed off in a hissy fit at her \"fix it for tonight, discuss tomorrow when we aren't tired\" suggestions.\n\nIf I had my dog for nine years and a six month boyfriend who was too allergic to exist around her, I know who I'd be leaving behind.", "I\u2019d never judge anyone who found an animal that eats out of litter boxes to be revolting. I\u2019d rather consider them to be people who have more practicality and common sense than the average.", "Sure, I'd view them as having an heightened sense of disgust to the point where it impedes their empathy - which is also commonly found people who support fascist and racist ideologies."]}
