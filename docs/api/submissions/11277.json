My bf Cameron asked me to over a month ago and I just moved everything out of my former place today. \n\nI have a dog, Sammy, who is 9 years old. I rescued him when he was around 2 and he\u2019s seen me through some really rough things. I was in an abusive relationship for a while that also really affected him. That ended two years ago and it\u2019s been just Sammy and I since then. \n\nCameron has a dog as well. She\u2019s a large breed (around 60 pounds where Sammy is around 30). She\u2019s just over three and he rescued her when she was just under a year old. She had sometimes slept in his room with him, but mostly in a crate. My dog has never slept in a crate, I don\u2019t disagree with that method of training at all, but I\u2019d be unwilling to force that on my dog, now that he\u2019s so old. \n\nI go to bed before my boyfriend and the last two nights he\u2019s been coming to bed and locking my dog out of the room. He\u2019d mentioned, prior to doing this, thinking about not having my dog sleep in the room, and every time he brought it up, I expressed my discomfort. My dog and I have been through some rough things and he\u2019s never not slept near me. \n\nTonight, I stayed up much later with boyfriend while he played on the computer. We went to go to bed and he tried to lock my dog out and I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. He said my dog affected his allergies and makes weird mouth noises that we\u2019re keeping him awake (his dog is not hypoallergenic). I said I respected that he needed sleep, I wanted to try to solve this issue when it wasn\u2019t nearly midnight, and that I\u2019d like to either sleep on the couch with my dog nearby or sleep with the door open until we could have a proper conversation. He was really upset by this and told me both options were \u201ccrap.\u201d I asked him for compromises and he didn\u2019t have any. He then walked out while I was mid sentence to sleep in his guest room (strictly no dogs allowed in that room). \n\nI don\u2019t know what I did wrong. I know I can be overprotective of my dog. Am I being unreasonable? I was trying to help. \n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend is allergic to my dog and instead of sleeping in the same room I offered to sleep on the couch\n\nEdit: I\u2019d been at his home basically every night for the previous month and a half with my dog and he\u2019d never not slept in the room - I didn\u2019t think it was something for us to discuss. I also know he\u2019s allergic (I can tell when it gets worse), I think it\u2019s just a very mild reaction. Prior to this when it seemed to be getting worse, we just knew it was time to wash the sheets, vacuum and dust. I was hoping to talk to him about brushing/bathing more regularly in a longer discussion the next day. \n\nEdit 2: as clarification, I don\u2019t need my dog to sleep IN the bed, just in the same room. Sammy typically just sleeps near me. He\u2019s also 9 and has really slowed down in the last year which makes me constantly aware of the fact that I may not have much time left with him.", "created_utc": 1677746521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fxpb6/aita_for_sleeping_downstairs_when_my_boyfriend/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I honestly doubt that he actually is allergic to your dog (and somehow not his?) and only uses this as a cheap excuse for his own preferences. However, both sides are understandable, wanting and not wanting a dog in the bedroom while sleeping. I know people who love their dogs with all their heart but wouldnt allow them to sleep in the bedroom with them. Doesnt necessarily mean they dont like dogs, its just a preference. I'd say, especially since youve only been together for 6 months, you need to decide for yourself if thats something you are willing to sacrifice for this relationship or not.

We just won't get any new pets in the future.  \n\n\nIf he knew about his dog allergy before getting a dog, got one anyway AND had a second dog move in as well....I guess he doesn't mind his allergy that much.  \nPersonally, I don't find anything wrong with sleeping in separate rooms if one of the rooms is kept pet free and he can have better sleep there. Then OP can sleep near her dog in the other room. Sleeping separately doesn't have to be a negative thing if it results in better sleep and mental health for everyone involved (including OP's elderly dog).", "So I have to ask the question, did you ever sleep over at each other's places prior to moving in together?
