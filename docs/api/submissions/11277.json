My bf Cameron asked me to over a month ago and I just moved everything out of my former place today. \n\nI have a dog, Sammy, who is 9 years old. I rescued him when he was around 2 and he\u2019s seen me through some really rough things. I was in an abusive relationship for a while that also really affected him. That ended two years ago and it\u2019s been just Sammy and I since then. \n\nCameron has a dog as well. She\u2019s a large breed (around 60 pounds where Sammy is around 30). She\u2019s just over three and he rescued her when she was just under a year old. She had sometimes slept in his room with him, but mostly in a crate. My dog has never slept in a crate, I don\u2019t disagree with that method of training at all, but I\u2019d be unwilling to force that on my dog, now that he\u2019s so old. \n\nI go to bed before my boyfriend and the last two nights he\u2019s been coming to bed and locking my dog out of the room. He\u2019d mentioned, prior to doing this, thinking about not having my dog sleep in the room, and every time he brought it up, I expressed my discomfort. My dog and I have been through some rough things and he\u2019s never not slept near me. \n\nTonight, I stayed up much later with boyfriend while he played on the computer. We went to go to bed and he tried to lock my dog out and I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. He said my dog affected his allergies and makes weird mouth noises that we\u2019re keeping him awake (his dog is not hypoallergenic). I said I respected that he needed sleep, I wanted to try to solve this issue when it wasn\u2019t nearly midnight, and that I\u2019d like to either sleep on the couch with my dog nearby or sleep with the door open until we could have a proper conversation. He was really upset by this and told me both options were \u201ccrap.\u201d I asked him for compromises and he didn\u2019t have any. He then walked out while I was mid sentence to sleep in his guest room (strictly no dogs allowed in that room). \n\nI don\u2019t know what I did wrong. I know I can be overprotective of my dog. Am I being unreasonable? I was trying to help. \n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend is allergic to my dog and instead of sleeping in the same room I offered to sleep on the couch\n\nEdit: I\u2019d been at his home basically every night for the previous month and a half with my dog and he\u2019d never not slept in the room - I didn\u2019t think it was something for us to discuss. I also know he\u2019s allergic (I can tell when it gets worse), I think it\u2019s just a very mild reaction. Prior to this when it seemed to be getting worse, we just knew it was time to wash the sheets, vacuum and dust. I was hoping to talk to him about brushing/bathing more regularly in a longer discussion the next day. \n\nEdit 2: as clarification, I don\u2019t need my dog to sleep IN the bed, just in the same room. Sammy typically just sleeps near me. He\u2019s also 9 and has really slowed down in the last year which makes me constantly aware of the fact that I may not have much time left with him.", "created_utc": 1677746521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fxpb6/aita_for_sleeping_downstairs_when_my_boyfriend/", "score": 256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I honestly doubt that he actually is allergic to your dog (and somehow not his?) and only uses this as a cheap excuse for his own preferences. However, both sides are understandable, wanting and not wanting a dog in the bedroom while sleeping. I know people who love their dogs with all their heart but wouldnt allow them to sleep in the bedroom with them. Doesnt necessarily mean they dont like dogs, its just a preference. I'd say, especially since youve only been together for 6 months, you need to decide for yourself if thats something you are willing to sacrifice for this relationship or not.

Outside of that, this is a clear cut communication issue where the BF was fine with the dog sleeping with them prior to OP moving in and then changing the rules after she moved in. He's not an asshole for having allergies though. He's an asshole for his childish behavior and for pulling a bait and switch.", "How is this a compromise?", ">I don\u2019t like how your boyfriend handles conflict. He walks away from you in midsentence, refuses to discuss anything and refuses to compromise. Not a good foundation upon which to build a future.

He was okay with the dog sleeping in the bed with him until she was committed to moving in with him (aka she no longer has anywhere else to go.)", "For our entire relationship, if I was staying the night, my dog stayed in the bedroom. I didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t like it up until a week prior to my completely moving in. I felt blindsided in the middle of the night and didn\u2019t say I HAD to have my dog sleep in the room. I said I wanted to have a larger discussion when we could both express ourselves and explore some alternative options when we weren\u2019t extremely tired. I offered to sleep on the couch, because I didn\u2019t want to just abandon my dog (maybe an overreaction, but I wasn\u2019t expecting this) because I respect that he needs good sleep and that my dog was keeping him awake.

He got really upset and said that her suggestions were \u201ccrap.\u201c So she asked him if he had any compromises of his own.

Mature adults don't just storm off when they don't get their way, we use our words. \n\nOP clearly states she was trying to find a solution for that night so they could go to bed and discuss more long term solutions when it's not nearly midnight.", "I don\u2019t live a life that would make a dog very happy, nor do I care for the smells and messes that come with them.

The bf's allergies are his own responsibility to make sure they are not exacerbated, which he did not do. And the fact that he was frankly very disproportionately irritated at the fact that she wanted them both to sleep on and talk later pushes it into NTA for me. You're right it'll be more her problem than his. But that \\*is\\* his fault, because he misrepresented what living with him would be for lack of clarification. He is the one who invited her, so he should have made everything clearer.

She clearly stated, in the post that she didn\u2019t want to have the discussion at midnight. She offered two compromises that her boyfriend didn\u2019t like.

He didn't. Neither of us were withholding affection. We wanted different things. \n\nNow that the dog is older she chooses to fall asleep with me on the bed and then put herself in her kennel sometime after I am asleep. Once she started doing that it was easy for my fiance to come to bed (as he usually plays computer games for awhile after I go to bed) and ask her to kennel. Sometimes she chooses to get up and move, other times she snuggles deeper into the bed because she's not ready yet. Then he decides if he wants to fit in next to her or sleep elsewhere.

The OP is uncomfortable with the dog sleeping elsewhere. Boyfriend should be concerned about OP\u2018s mental health.  \n\n3.  I totally understand why someone who uses an analogy about pushing people out of windows, might think my argument is ridiculous.  I\u2019m not sure how your analogy matches with the actual situation. OP suggested a temporary compromise where neither person would suffer. Cameron gets to sleep in his bed and 0P gets to sleep near her dog, which is a more comfortable situation for her and her dog. \n\n4.  Go on with your analogy, a more accurate depiction would be that one solution means OP pushers boyfriend out the window and the other solution is boyfriend pushes OP out the window. Because you are suggesting that OP should just abandon her dog and sleep in the bedroom with her boyfriend, which is the equivalent of her getting pushed out of the window in your and I\u2019m being kind here, fanciful analogy.\n\n5.  I don\u2019t know what other compromise boyfriend could\u2019ve offered. I\u2019m obviously not boots on the ground. There could be things about the situation that OP has not shared that would give more clarity.  With that being said, boyfriend did not have a compromise and so he was in no place to shit on the OP\u2019s suggestions.\n\n6. Even if he did have a better solution, the way he communicates his thoughts is horribly destructive. Walking away from someone in the middle of a sentence is extremely disrespectful and calling your suggestions \u201ccrap\u201c is very dismissive.
