My mom is deceased, and my dad (64m) is currently staying with us due to some health problems. He helps with groceries and bills. \n\nMy In laws recently divorced, and my mother in law (55f) stayed with us briefly during the divorce. After the marital home was sold, my father in law (55m) refused to respond to any letters and held up the process by months by refusing to leave-we tried our best not to get involved in that. Once the home was sold, my mother in law moved out. He moved back to the city where he grew up, which is roughly 2 hours from us with no traffic.\n\nA couple weeks before Thanksgiving, my husband reached out to his dad (my father in law) to ask if he wanted to attend Thanksgiving with us. He agreed. A few days later, he called and asked my husband if he could come pick him up. He said that due to his work schedule, he would have to be picked up from the city and driven back to the city on Thanksgiving Day. \n\nWe host Thanksgiving at our home, and my husband works third shift. He had to work on Wednesday night. If he were to do this, he would have to spend over 4 hours in the car on Thanksgiving Day and would not be around to help me with any preparation, nor have time to sleep before Thanksgiving dinner. \n\nAt this point, we suggested that he take the bus (there is a bus line that had about 20 direct trips to our town from his town on Thanksgiving morning). We looked up the schedule, told him where and when to be at the station, and offered to buy a $50 bus ticket for him. My husband also offered to drive him back to the city in the evening.\n\nMy FIL did NOT like this idea. He completely flipped out on my husband, saying that he obviously didn't want to see him. He called him nasty names and accused him of caring about my father (who is not involved in any of this) more than him. He refused, said that he would not be attending, and thanked my husband for showing him where their relationship stood and said \"I hope you enjoyed having a father, because this is a really good way to end our relationship.\"\n\nHe didn't show up on Thanksgiving, and he has blocked both me and my husband from calls/texts and social media. Neither of us have spoken to him since. \n\nAre we the assholes?", "created_utc": 1669980959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zajo9x/aita_for_making_my_father_in_law_spend/", "score": 426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That guy is an entitled AH.  You offered to buy his bus ticket, which is more than I would have done.  Demanding that someone drive 4 hours to pick you up is over the top.", "NTA. Your father-in-law started out with an unreasonable demand, refused to compromise, the has a tantrum when no one would bend over backward to accommodate him. I think that sounds like the behavior of someone that wanted to be mad more than they wanted to be present", "NTA. Not only you gave him (and financially supported) and option, he would only come by bus in the morning. Your husband would spend 2 hours going to his dad's house, another 2 to come home. And another 4 hours at the end of the day. You just wanted to cut 4 hours in the morning for convenience.\n\nI guess we all now why MIL divorced him.", "A grown, capable, man demanding busy people to drop everything to shuttle him to and fro is ridiculous.

Including the sidebar story of the refusal to leave after his prior home was legally sold was a good idea. It clearly helps to demonstrate he\u2019s a complete stubborn jackass.  He shouldn\u2019t have even wanted his son to drive that much right after a late shift to transport his royal highness to dinner.   The offering of a paid for bus ticket for one half of the trip was very reasonable, which he is simply not.

Any future invitations should be phrased as \"We'd like to see you at Easter if you'll be in town\"", "NTA. You father in law sounds like one though. Be happy he didn't come, I suspect there would have been even more drama. This is a man  who will consistently put himself over everyone else, not caring about who he inconveniences.  No wonder he's divorced.", "NTA", "NTA - FIL sounds like a whiny child who wants everyone to make an effort but him, then throws tantrums and emotional blackmail. Leave him to his devices", "NTA.. I'm truly seeing why his marriage ended. He's a massive AH.\n\nYou offered to pay for the ticket. It wasn't good enough for him. He would prefer that his son drive 4 hours just to appease him. That's him causing issues for no reason.", "NTA. Your FIL is an entitled ass.", "NTA, not one bit. Let him stew alone for the rest of his life. He sounds a lot like my dad who is a narcissist. There is no reasoning with them, because they aren\u2019t reasonable people.", "NTA.  Generally speaking, the person hosting for the holidays doesn\u2019t get responsibility for shuttling the guests to their house unless they offer to.  Demanding someone drive 4 hours to shuttle you to and fro is pretty rude unless there\u2019s no other way to get there - he had the options of a bus or renting a car and driving himself.  The specifics of your situation make it even ruder, since it would mean your husband loses out on much-needed sleep - that doesn\u2019t sound safe!\n\nIf the hosts offer to come get you, it\u2019s fine to accept, but demanding is not cool.", "NTA.

UMMM...yea, not the asshole. You're father-in-law however IS THE AH!! From everything you've written so far, it sounds like father-in-law likes to throw tantrums and ultimatums.

You were spared a miserable Thanksgiving.", "Ohh absolutely NTA. \n\nStop even trying with your father-in-law. He made his choice to move away and cannot expect people to come get him. I live 90 miles away from most of my blood family and would never expect any of them to come get me because I don\u2019t have a car. That\u2019s just foolish of your father-in-law to expect that especially when you were willing to buy the bus ticket for him, and it would\u2019ve only have been in one direction. \n\nHonestly, given how he acted during the divorce, he just doesn\u2019t really sound like a very good person to be around", "NTA, sounds like he wanted an excuse to cut you guys out without making himself the bad guy.", "NTA.

He was pulling a power trip.  Pretty similar to what he did with his ex wife during the divorce.  You are both NTA, and hopefully you enjoyed the peace of not seeing him.
