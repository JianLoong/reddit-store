Not sure what an apology from FIL specifically will fix here.... There were multiple adults \u201cwatching\u201d the kids. None of them did a very good job. The question is how will they change their behavior in the future? \n\nIf you drop & break a cup no amount of apology will repair the cup. The damage is done. Either FIL understands how he screwed up or he doesn\u2019t. In which case, shame on you if you allow them to look after your kids in the future.\n\nIf you & husband don\u2019t want him to stay at your house then tell him that. You don\u2019t need a reason. \n\nNTA\n\neta \u2014 I truly understand this is your worst nightmare & am not defending your ILs however as a mom of 4 I have had to jump in fully clothed to rescue my own kids who (have no fear) just decided to jump in the deep end in front of me ... yes I was watching them (it was in our own pool) but they are kids & they can get themselves in trouble. Get your kids swim lessons!!! It can save their lives. Adults are not always at fault in these situations.", "Not a word from anyone. I\u2019m the type to apologize if a kid in my care even skins their knee. So for nobody to even reach out to me I\u2019m just stunned", "NTA. These people have no business taking care of children.\n\nINFO: What happened to the four-year-old? Did he drown or live? It seems you've left out a key part of the story.", "INFO. You said your BIL and FIL were supposed to be watching your son. *Were they watching your son?* I ask, because it can happen so quickly where a kid jumps into a pool. If they got him out before he breathed in any water when he fell into the deep end, they probably reacted pretty quickly. \n\nEven if they were watching him and responded appropriately, it's OK to be angry. Your child's life was at risk, and he almost died. In this case, I would be angry at the brother-in-law and sister-in-law for having a pool that wasn't secure and less at the FIL and MIL. It's sad that it probably took an incident like this for them to take pool safety seriously, and I bet they make a bigger effort to keep the gate closed now. \n\nI don't know your MIL and FIL, but I imagine they'd never hurt your child on purpose (correct me if I'm wrong). I'm guessing they love your children--their grandchildren--and that's why they cared for them. They made a mistake not checking the gate, a big mistake, and it could have cost your son, their grandson, his life. \n\nIt's OK to be angry right now and tell them you need some space. You DO need some space. Afterwards, it's probably a good idea to not let any of them babysit anymore. They aren't thinking about safety in a way your son clearly needs. However, after you get your space and deal with some of your emotions tied to this situation, then I think you need to let the relationship heal. They didn't hurt your son on purpose, and it's important that children have their grandparents in their lives (unless they are abusive or something, of course). \n\nAlso, as a side note: Get your kids in swimming lessons. They don't need to be athletes or anything, but they need to be able to swim to an edge of a pool if they fall in, or do a float if they fall into a lake. FWIW, my parents once took my kids to a hotel pool. My son wasn't a strong swimmer at the time and ventured out too deep. He was on tip toes and struggled to get back to the shallow end and said he couldn't call out to my parents. My parents never realized he was in distress. My son made it but then refused to go swimming with them again (smart kid!). I got my kids in better swim lessons after that, and now they can both swim 50 yards. I feel much safer now knowing they can easily swim to the edge of a pool. Now when my daughter goes to events like girl scout camp that has a pool with a deep end, I'm not scared wondering if the counselors will be attentive enough.", "NTA They haven't said sorry?!", "NTA!!! Your baby could have drowned! I used to work in Water safety and a child can drown in only 30 seconds. It\u2019s extremely negligent on your cousins part for not locking up the pool in general. I\u2019m so sorry your family is going through this.", "NTA why tf hasn't he apologized already?!?!", "NTA. \n\nYOUR SON COULDVE DIED and they don\u2019t see it as an issue. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even talk to the family. An apology means nothing.", "NTA this is absolutely terrifying and could have ended in utter tragedy. Children can drown with little to no sound and extremely quickly. This is horrifying!", "NTA\n\nGuy almost killed your son through negligence and you have every right to be angry.", "Info needed- did FIL just drop the kids off and leave? How did he explain what happened? There was no apology involved at that time??", "NTA, but is your son all right?", "Nope this person has proven they cannot be trusted around your child.

I would not allow the child there without a pool alarm and never in FIL\u2019s care ever AGAIN!!!!", "NTA. Your child could have died. You have every right to be angry.\n\nNot only should your in-laws apologise, but you should consider whether you want your children over there without you or your husband. They're not prioritising your children's safety.", "You leave your children with people you know can't really be trusted.  And this is what happens.", "NTA in the slightest. That's really bad", "I get that childcare is expensive. I have two kids. But I would never allow my family to watch them. You can\u2019t fire family. You can go no contact.NTA but I would look at hiring childcare or sending them somewhere safe.", "NTA!!! but you are not going far enough. Your FIL is a danger to your children and should NOT be alone with them!\n\nEdit: Corrected to NTA! I mistyped it originally!", "Do you have child proof pool fencing/gates? If you do and the in laws somehow let them in, then I'd be going NC with these people. If you haven't installed a pool fence then I'd say YTA.

I'd be mad at the BIL for not doing a better job with the gate. I bet this scares him into doing a better job!

You said he went off on them\u2014which is absolutely appropriate and mandatory\u2014but has he cooled off since then?\n\nFIL\u2019s negligence almost took your child away, and his nonchalant attitude about it all hasn\u2019t caused your \u2018mama bear\u2019 to kick this dangerous nut out of your lives for good? You\u2019ll allow him around your kids again if he utters two words?\n\nHow is a negligent and downright dangerous person supposed to be trusted again because you insist on hearing two words? Two words that he\u2019s forced to say to you. He should have thrown himself on your mercy, crying, and he should have screamed \u201cI\u2019m SORRY!\u201d Over and over. I\u2019m not trying to sound harsh, but this event scared and scarred your 9-year-old for life. A child that age will not forget.

Good luck with this mess. Please keep your FIL (BIL sounds flaky, too. Did he apologize at all?) away from your kids.", "I don't have kids, but jeez that must have been TERRIFYING. I'm sorry that happened to you and you have every right to have that sort of anger around them. I know kids get away fast but that's all the more reason to make it so they can't go far in the 1st place. You are NTA for saying FIL isn't welcome.", "So, to be clear, they *were* watching your son, right? And your son fell in, and they got him out right away? I'm just trying to make sure I have the info right.\n\nFrom your story and comments, this is how I'm interpreting what happened:\n\n* Your son likes to go to pools but isn't a good swimmer.\n* Your sister-in-law and brother-in-law have a pool with a safety gate around it, but they almost never close it.\n* When you go over to your sister-in-law & brother-in-law's house, you go out and close the gate every time to make sure your son is safe. (Had you ever talked to your BIL and SIL about keeping it closed and your concerns?)\n* Your kids were with your father-in-law that day, and he took them to your brother-in-law's and sister-in-law's house.\n* Your brother-in-law and sister-in-law left the pool gate open. Your father-in-law didn't check it.\n* Your brother-in-law and father-in-law were watching your son.\n* They saw your son fall into the pool.\n* They ran over and got him out.\n* Your son is OK.\n\nI just want to make sure this is what happened, because, to me, your father-in-law only made one mistake, and that is not verifying the gate was closed like it should have been. It sounds like he was keeping an eye on your son and responded swiftly. It's still OK to be angry at what happened. But, if this is what happened, then I think you need to be willing to forgive with a little time. Just don't let him watch your kids anymore if you can't trust his judgement.\n\nTo me, the bigger issue here is your sister-in-law and brother-in-law not keeping their pool gate closed. For some reason, you seem more angry at your FIL than your SIL & BIL. It's OK to be angry in general right now because your son's life was in danger, but then be careful at who you are directing your anger at. It would be like.... if my brother was cooking and left the gas on, but then I got angry at my dad for not checking that he turned it off. Unless your brother-in-law and sister-in-law have developmental disabilities, they are the ones who made the big mistake here that could have cost a child his life.", "Yeah absolutely! He\u2019s done the baby swim classes but after thins I\u2019ve enrolled him in state swim (really good quality swim class in Aus)", "My niece was getting swimming lessons at 4.

Thanks. \n\nNTA, even if he apologized to your husband, he should be addressing it with you directly and apologizing as well.  I would make clear that no one but you or your husband are to bring the kids over to BIL's (with the pool) house ever again.\n\nAdding - I'd probably also never have FIL watch the kids again ever. \n\nJust for safety sake, another poster mentioned it as well- especially since the 4 year old is such a magnet to water- please get them swimming lessons ASAP.", "Smart girl. Poor kid, she probably feels horribly guilty, and it wasn't her fault.\nMy kid would never have unsupervised visits with them again.

I continually make it knowing to BIL and SIL the pool gate needs to be closed but it gets nowhere. My nephew (10 yo) jumped in a pulled my son out.

I\u2019m gonna tell you one thing about people like this, and their main goal in life is to allow people (family especially) to roll over you, but you must stay silent to keep the peace.
