She says things like: I'm a gross guy who tracks the time where my friends have their periods and that I have a kink for periods. My female friends know which drawer the products are in and they don't have to tell me then they take something even they take the last one because I understand that not everyone I comfortable talking about it. The only time I take a look at the drawer is every two to three months to see if I have to buy some products or when a friend is comfortable and is telling me that something is empty. Two days ago at evening my roommate and his girlfriend came to me and asked if I could let her take a hygiene product of mine, I told them no and that they had to go buy some because she surely wouldn't like to have some of my gross stuff. They only had 15 minutes till the stores closed (we live on the edge of a city and public transportation is good here so we don't have a car), we have a store near us but to get there in time on foot they had to run. After one or two insult from them and realizing I meant what I said they started to run. They got there in time and if they didn't make it I would let them take something out of my bathroom but at the moment I just wanted them to have some what of a consequence.

If she hasn't apologized then she's an idiot.", "If you meant what you said about giving her some products if they hadn\u2019t made it to the store on time then NTA.", "ESH.\n\nYou're right, not everyone is comfortable about that kind of thing, which was no excuse for them being insulting about it.  But you seem to realize they were being defensive because they legit thought it was weird because no one they know does anything like that.  That if someone is thinking about that kind of thing, it must be for pervy reasons, and in their experience they're probably right.  The people who talk about it or take an interest in it probably are creepy about it.\n\nDoesn't mean you are a creep for it, and they found out the benefit of it when they needed it.\n\nBut instead of using it as a teaching moment to help them broaden their perspective, you slammed the door in their face.\n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right.  Sounds like they already were at the point where they might have apologized for how they treated you, if you had simply let them.  Instead, you made it adversarial.", "NTA, that's a sweet thing to do; your female friends clearly appreciate it.  your roomies gf deserved it though, maybe next time she'll be a bit more careful about what she says.", "NTA. She deserved every bit of it.", "Yup. This is the only way for her to learn her lesson.", "Yep. Tell her to screw off. At least her bf understand.s", "My roommate did, his girlfriend still don't talk to me but that is fine with me. My roommate promised me to talk with her about it when she calmed down. He is still lightly pissed that he had to run to the store but understand why I did it.", "When they hadn't made it I would have given them what she needed, I may be asshole for letting them run but I'm no monster who let her be without products for a whole night maybe longer because stores are closed here at sundays", "Nothing the OP did was weird in anyway for the flatmate and the girlfriend to be rude to him for any period of time. Also it doesn\u2019t seem like they apologized because OP says \u201csince that day\u201d she has been insulting him. Also when he said no they continued to insult him\u2026so I don\u2019t know how anything the OP did was an AH move. Just because you would take the high road and give them the product doesn\u2019t mean the OP is obligated to or that they are an AH for standing up for themselves.", "There is nothing pervy, gross, embarrassing about periods. We did not ask for them. It is how our body tells us that we are not pregnant. Get over it!", "I disagree. What would they have learned if OP handed over a tampon? \n\nOP saying no is teaching them that actions have consequences. If you insult someone for stocking period products, you don't get to turn around and ask for one when you need it. You have to go to the store like an adult.\n\nYou also have a weird, backwards take on why it was okay for the gf to be insulting and for the roommate to condone it.", "I'm waffling between agreeing with you and thinking that OP isn't an AH. \n\nI've had similar situations occur, where someone thinks I'm weirdly overprepared, but then they are in a situation where they could really use my supplies. A simple \"Hey, I get it now, I'm sorry I made fun of it before, can I borrow your XYZ?\"\n\nSure, no problem, now you see there's a reason why I come prepared. I'm happy to help.\n\nBut if there's no acknowledgment or humility, just a demand to share, then I don't want to help someone who riduculed me and shows no remorse. \n\nSo, for me, it depends on if there was some form of apology from the roommate and his GF, or if they came in and just said, \"Hey, give me some of the stuff that I called you creepy and gross for, and no, there will be no apology or thank you, just give me your stuff!\"", "she can get bent mate, what you're doing is a service to your friends, witha \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy for their comfort, at your own expense\n\nI have a wife, a mother and a sister, if they have a friend like you I would be incredibly thankful to you for been of such help and because you're not a creep about it, keep it up!! you're solid as F", "In that case, I would have given her some period products, with the understanding that unless she stops her \"creepy\" comments, there will not be anymore in the future.\n\nSo, a little ESH, with you being the smallest AH in this scenario.", "Yeah you\u2019re all good. Refusing at that point would have been cruel, but that\u2019s neither here nor there seeing as they got them on time anyway.", "I didn't say there was.\n\nI said some people were not comfortable with it.  The person in OP's story is apparently one of them, considering the remarks she made about it.\n\nI've got a box of pads in my trunk for the same reason as OP, so maybe try not attacking your allies, hmmm?", "> You also have a weird, backwards take on why it was okay for the gf to be insulting and for the roommate to condone it.\n\nPlease point me to where I said it was okay for them to have done it.\n\nThere is a difference between understanding where someone is coming from, and accepting it as appropriate.\n\nMy verdict was that EVERYONE sucks, precisely because of what they did NOT being appropriate.  But just because they were an ass about it doesn't justify OP being an ass in return.  It just means there are two asses here.", "He tried to apologize but she didn't let him, she just asked: where is the stuff in your bathroom?", "IMO, the correct answer here is to be the bigger person, the first time.\n\nLet them have it.  See if they apologize/change their ways/etc.  If they don't, THEN you have a legitimate reason to deny them the next time.", "Nah, OP is in the clear. \n\nShe's a guest in his home, but not his guest. There was zero reason for her to be shitty with OP. She accuses him of being some kind of pervert regularly. She has not apologized for insulting him in his own home.\n\nThere is no reason why OP should go out of his way to make her welcome at this point.", "I think I miss understanded your question in the moment they didn't apologize, I know he tried by the way he looked but she didn't let him. He apologized to me the next day then she went home and I had a conversation about it with him. But I still accept that I am somewhat of a asshole", "\"so maybe try not attacking your allies, hmmm?\"\n\nhahahaha the roomie GF was the one attacking her \"ally\" per your logic, even if you're not comfortable approaching the subject, you don't berate a person for being F'ing nice just to be called a pervert and gross, she wasn't even nice when she ask him about \"borrowing\" something (because is she also expect to just use the thing without replenish them, she is even worse)\n\nall I'm saying in the end, if she was F'ing uncomfortable, she should just kept her trap shut! he wasn't doing anyones harm by keeping a F'ing stash for his friends, having a policy of \"don't ask, don't tell\" about so his friends could feel safe and comfortable without disclosing her period with anybody", "Yeah, don't listen to this crap OP. These people think that you need to be a doormat to people who are unreasonably rude to you over you being nice to your friends. \n\nThis person is not your friend and they have repeatedly disrespected you in your own home. You have zero reasons to put yourself out for them. \n\nMaybe next time they will be nicer to someone instead of being an asshole over some weird hang up that they have", "His gf is an absolute AH. She needs to stop coming over if she can't be moderately polite. I'd have a talk with your roommate.", "That sounds actually like the best solution, and probably what I would rather do. \n\nI've been in the situation where someone made fun of my preparedness, but then apologized, so I was happy to help out and get them out of a jam. \n\nBut I've never been in the situation where things were just demanded without some kind of apology. I think I would, as you said, help the first time and then not again if there was no apology.", "And is there some point in all of this where \"Everybody Sucks Here\" changed it's meaning?\n\nWhat she did was wrong.  What OP did was also wrong.  Hence \"Everybody Sucks Here\".", "I already had a conversation with him. He is really a good guy and friend. I know him since I'm 15, his only problem is that he never had a backbone when it came to his girlfriends", "I get it but for me he was an asshole, she is not entitled to his thing because of a \"emergency\", also in another comment, OP said that she demanded the stuff, not even ask for it nicely, if someone called me a gross pervert man and then demanded my help, I would for certain told them to F themselves, why should he be the bigger person and graceful? he could have loose some friends because of her\n\nthat's why I don't agree with you, in the case of OP, if you respect people is not out of this world, to expect a little respect back, she lacks basic human courtesy", "He's not a good guy or friend if he condones her behavior. Allowing her to continually come into your home and insult you without saying anything to her or refusing to invite her back if she can't behave, is condoning her behavior. \n\nWhy can't he see his gf at her house and leave you in peace?", "If he was justified in being an asshole back or not is not the question or the purpose of this sub.\n\nThe question was \"Was OP the asshole in the situation described\" and \"Someone needed something I could easily supply, but don't like them so I flaunted in their face that they couldn't have it and made them scramble in a panic\" is a dick move.  It just is.", "NTA\n\nKick rocks is the right answer here. No one owes her shit. Especially if she's gonna be snotty and rude, and not even apologize. Keep your gross stuff to yourself and let her sort herself out.", "NTA- if you\u2019re so gross, why does she need anything from you. \nYou are very kind and understanding to have these emergency supplies for your friends! Before I lived with my boyfriend/husband, I actually bought my own supplies to keep at his house. This is something she needs to do if she\u2019s going to spend time there.", "NTA- And you are the absolute model modern gentleman and considerate host!", "NTA if she wants to enjoy your generosity then she shouldn't be such a giant AH", "NTA. Once you poison a well, you cannot drink from it.", "A concept as old as time: actions have consequences.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nShe was a shitty person, then wanted a favor from the target of her shittiness?  Good for you in telling her to pound sand.", "NTA\n\nShe was nasty and rude but then wanted to benefit from your \"gross/kinky\" ways.  Forget that.", "She made her bed, now she gets to lie in it, bloody or not. NTA.", "NTA. This is actually a really nice thing to do. Roommates gf is a jerk.", "NTA, she\u2019s giving \u201csour grapes.\u201d\n\nAs a woman, I love that more cis men are keeping period products at their places. She\u2019s wrong, keeping them around doesn\u2019t inherently mean you\u2019re \u201ctracking.\u201d That\u2019s like saying that by keeping extra bandaids and first aid supplies, you\u2019re planning on hurting someone.", "NTA OP, and can I say as a cis gendered woman, you sound like an incredible friend to have! I know that if we were friends, I would definitely be grateful towards your thoughtfulness in a moment of need. And your flatmate and his gf definitely need to learn actions have consequences. You can\u2019t just sling and throw insults at somebody constantly and expect them to want to help you. That being said, with her history of calling you \u201cperverted\u201d and \u201ccreepy\u201d whose to say she also wouldn\u2019t potentially hold that over your head OP, in the future if you did help her and her say something along the lines of \u201comg OP is so creepy talking my periods\u201d and essentially throw your thoughtful gesture back in your face. Like I don\u2019t blame you myself for NOT wanting to help her.", "Paragraphs are your friend.\n\nYTA for this made up BS. Not even a little bit believable.", "You did a nice thing and then ruined it.\n\nThis was your big opportunity to shine!!!!!! Oh well, at least you showed that rude lady you can be just as rude.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. First of all men should have NO involvement in women\u2019s bodies, it\u2019s actually gross how obsessed you are with their periods. If you actually cared about women\u2019s health, you would have given her the products she needed, especially given it was the evening and it was possibly dark outside. You would rather a women bleed through her clothing than drop your ego, you need to quit your performative allyship.", "NTA. At all", "NTA. she\u2019s being a nasty person insulting you, but then all nice when she wants something. nope. She can go pound sand\u2026or in this case pound pavement to get to the store.", "Brilliant solution - WELL DONE", "NTA\n\nI guffawed at this. Sucks to suck lady!\n\nAlso please keep doing what you're doing OP. That is so thoughtful of you.", "NTA. You're a thoughtful friend for having these on-hand for your friends.", "NTA at all whatsoever. And thank you for being so considerate of your friends and stocking products for them. She was nasty to you for doing something that, not only your friends appreciate, but us internet strangers appreciate;  seriously it's so nice hearing that you do that for your friends. She insulted you for your kindness and then had the audacity to ask you for something she had been insulting about. She deserved nothing from you and felt the deserved consequences of her behavior.", "NTA, but i hope that when you check whether you need refills, you're also checking for expired products ... and i'm going to go ahead and finish this comment and leave it even though when i just looked on google i learned that they seem to have a shelf life of five years, so maybe check that yearly.", "You are a great person for doing this for your friends. Have you read about Dave the Period Fairy? No joke. He is a legend.\n\nEdited bc I messed up the name.", "NTA. Maybe next time she won't be so rude.", "NTA and in your shoes I wouldn't have even given her anything if they didn't get to the store in time. I mean if she is at home or her BF's home, she could have managed with toilet paper in the underwear for some hours. Leakage would not have been a catastrophe as she was in private. She could have sent out her BF once the store is open again in the morning to get her some pads. Even a man can't really do much wrong there. Whatever else she might have wanted like a tampon or different pads, she could have bought then later herself.", "NTA\n\nthere are so many men on Reddit with period hang-ups. Like it isn't a normal bodily function. You are a considerate friend. Your roommate's GF wants to turn that into something gross and creepy. In which case why would she want to take anything from you? \n\nNow she knows why you have the drawer.", "NTA.. petty maybe, but rightfully so.   \nLike  how are you gonna insult someone for having these things and then run to them when you need them... pitiful, just pitiful.", "NTA. I think it's very kind that you do this for your friends.", "Here are some specifics because I read some comments that theorized about some Infos\n1. When they came to me and asked for them she said: where are the hygiene products in your bathroom? \nShe didn't knock and just stormed in, my roommate panicly running behind her. Her mood was angry and annoyed, she didn't yell but was nearly at it.\nMy roommate apologized the next day after she went home and we had a conversation\n2. My friends doesn't take whole packages, maybe sometimes 2 to 3 products when they didn't plan to get home for the next day and are somewhere else after our meet up or the next day is Sunday, in my home country every shop is closed at sunday. I look every two to three months because I like it more looking and still knowing I have enough then looking and seeing I have to buy multiple things.\n3. My promotion is important because of it I earn x amount of times more, it's somewhat stupid, I don't want to go to much in detail with my earnings. I got the job through a friend who became one of the headdeveloper for a relatively big company and for a year I was somewhat of a trainee/ assistant for the head manager of the designing team and now I'm the manger for ux and ui team. I just got lucky because I helped this friend regularly when he was in college and with his first projects, I'm really thankful for him he is one of the most talented and hard working person I know. Through this I have the possibilities to have the products in different sizes without hurting my lifestyle. When I lived in my first apartment I only had the extra money to have one or max two packages of products.", "NTA. Thats a very thoughtful thing to do for your friends. Shame on her for calling you a creep!", "NTA. She deserved it. She can\u2019t insult you for having period products and then ask for use some.", "Or even sincerely apologize for prior comments", "Agree 100%. My mom always did this, and I too always have a box with products on top of the toilet for guests. For a man to do this is very thoughtful!", "Yeah exactly! My first day at an internship, one of the more senior members told me that if I ever needed any period supplies, there was a range (plus painkillers) in her drawer that I/anyone was always welcome to. I've got the same thing now because of her.", "I do the same at my house. I've had a hysterectomy, so I don't have the need anymore. However, my teen daughter often has friends over. I stock what she uses herself, plus a variety of other basic products that her friends are welcome to help themselves to if needed without having to go through the awkwardness of asking for. I know they're being used because when I check that drawer, I often need to restock some of the more popular options. \nWhen I was a teenager, my mom didn't always keep up with that particular need, or only bought the off brand maxi type that felt like wearing a diaper and having better options would have been great!", "Delicious, delicious karma.", "Ooo how dramatic,\n\n>women bleed through her clothing\ud83e\udd23\n\nshe could always use a toilet paper, not comfortable, but the comments she made about OP aren't either.", "Found the gf", "Why can't she drop her ego first and apologize for insulting him?", "I already known this and I check for that but thank you for your consideration:)", "I don't know that story but I gonna find about it", ">learn her lesson\n\nSome people never learn.", "Agreed! I have spare in the bathroom cabinets and they've been used at least a couple of times in the last year alone", "Painkillers is such a good idea. Ibuprofen for the win", "I do this for my stepsons girlfriends as well. Whenever they\u2019ve stayed here or just visit they know to go to my bathroom for anything they need. I also just let them use my bathroom for whatever because the boys bathrooms were not the cleanest and growing up with brothers I would have appreciated someone doing that for me.", "Not to mention bringing up \"women's health\". I mean it is crap to bleed without having proper pads, tampons, cups or whatever else a woman might prefer for some hours, but it won't ruin a woman's health.", "I agree with everything you say here and have always had a box in the house for women in emergencies, but is it not a little unusual for a man to cite his promotion as a reason to diversify the types he keeps on hand? And to check if he needs to resupply every 2-3 months? Does he buy specific types/sizes based on his friends' preferences?\n\nKeeping a stash on hand to help out your friends is one thing, but being their regular supplier is kind of weird", "Here it is. https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/76dudd/a_story_about_dave_the_period_fairy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "What you're suggesting here amounts to buying politeness from a rude person. It doesn't work, ever. She just will feel entitled to use his products freely and will still consider him a creep. The change should come before benefits, only then it's genuine.", "That's such a weird way of telling someone they should be a doormat.", "If he doesn't know much, keeping as wide a variety of sanitary items is the best option. Periods are different for different people, and even for the same people on different days/months. \n\nThey can also be very expensive, which is why I'd assume the promotion is relevant - more pay means more disposable income, to spend on things that OP wants to", "No no no. You are NTA. She should have been apologizing profusely before asking. She is rude af", "I know they can be expensive, I'm married.\n\nAnd covering your friends in an emergency is expected, but OP's description implies quite a bit more than that -- which, in my world experience, is weird for a 23-year-old man to do.", "She lives in a small apartment with two other roommates, I'm little embarrassed to say that but it never crossed my mind to think that way. I think he talked with her about her comments but like I said not have the resolve to really solve this. Never thought about to say who he can invite over and who not, I try to talk with him about it. When it comes to me I think he should break up with her but who am I to decide with who he is together. In the end I think I'm just scared to lose him as a friend because he was one of my first real male friends. Thank you for your opinion, I sleep a night over it and try to get the courage to talk with him about it", "maybe not but you can expect that everybody consider him an asshole for this by his given context\n\nif I made and AITA for kicking a dog and the context was because said dog was about to rip a limb off, I hope I would not be considered an AH for it\n\nwhy should he be an AH for not giving away his property? by the end of the day he paid for it, she demanded it and he said no, at least for me NTA, you don't have to give away your sh!t\n\n\"being a dick\" life is hard, she should be prepared to face it with her chin up! even her BF thinks she was a dick! so I stick to my guns, for me he's NTA", "I feel you OP.
