We decided that both of us get one for themselves. Since I was a kid I always had more female friends because I had interest in Hobbys that there \"things for girls\" you know how things there when I was a kid. When I moved out from home in my first apartment I started to have a box with hygiene products for my friends because I witnessed more than one time that they needed something and no one had something with them when we were at places from male friends. Then I moved in with my now roommate, at my current home I have a drawer for the products and since I got a promotion last year I stocked my supply up with more products in different sizes. Then my roommate got a girlfriend (23f) half a year ago, at some point she found out about it, since that day she regularly makes nasty comments about me. She says things like: I'm a gross guy who tracks the time where my friends have their periods and that I have a kink for periods. My female friends know which drawer the products are in and they don't have to tell me then they take something even they take the last one because I understand that not everyone I comfortable talking about it. The only time I take a look at the drawer is every two to three months to see if I have to buy some products or when a friend is comfortable and is telling me that something is empty. Two days ago at evening my roommate and his girlfriend came to me and asked if I could let her take a hygiene product of mine, I told them no and that they had to go buy some because she surely wouldn't like to have some of my gross stuff. They only had 15 minutes till the stores closed (we live on the edge of a city and public transportation is good here so we don't have a car), we have a store near us but to get there in time on foot they had to run. After one or two insult from them and realizing I meant what I said they started to run. They got there in time and if they didn't make it I would let them take something out of my bathroom but at the moment I just wanted them to have some what of a consequence. Since then I'm thinking if I should have given them the products directly or am I just overthinking things?\n\nSorry if the text have some mistakes, english is not my native language", "created_utc": 1702919318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ldrqy/aita_for_refusing_to_give_periode_products_to_the/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she hasn't apologized then she's an idiot.", "If you meant what you said about giving her some products if they hadn\u2019t made it to the store on time then NTA.", "ESH.\n\nYou're right, not everyone is comfortable about that kind of thing, which was no excuse for them being insulting about it.  But you seem to realize they were being defensive because they legit thought it was weird because no one they know does anything like that.  That if someone is thinking about that kind of thing, it must be for pervy reasons, and in their experience they're probably right.  The people who talk about it or take an interest in it probably are creepy about it.\n\nDoesn't mean you are a creep for it, and they found out the benefit of it when they needed it.\n\nBut instead of using it as a teaching moment to help them broaden their perspective, you slammed the door in their face.\n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right.  Sounds like they already were at the point where they might have apologized for how they treated you, if you had simply let them.  Instead, you made it adversarial.", "NTA, that's a sweet thing to do; your female friends clearly appreciate it.  your roomies gf deserved it though, maybe next time she'll be a bit more careful about what she says.", "NTA. She deserved every bit of it.", "Yup. This is the only way for her to learn her lesson.", "Yep. Tell her to screw off. At least her bf understand.s", "My roommate did, his girlfriend still don't talk to me but that is fine with me. My roommate promised me to talk with her about it when she calmed down. He is still lightly pissed that he had to run to the store but understand why I did it.", "When they hadn't made it I would have given them what she needed, I may be asshole for letting them run but I'm no monster who let her be without products for a whole night maybe longer because stores are closed here at sundays", "Nothing the OP did was weird in anyway for the flatmate and the girlfriend to be rude to him for any period of time. Also it doesn\u2019t seem like they apologized because OP says \u201csince that day\u201d she has been insulting him. Also when he said no they continued to insult him\u2026so I don\u2019t know how anything the OP did was an AH move. Just because you would take the high road and give them the product doesn\u2019t mean the OP is obligated to or that they are an AH for standing up for themselves.", "There is nothing pervy, gross, embarrassing about periods. We did not ask for them. It is how our body tells us that we are not pregnant. Get over it!", "I disagree. What would they have learned if OP handed over a tampon? \n\nOP saying no is teaching them that actions have consequences. If you insult someone for stocking period products, you don't get to turn around and ask for one when you need it. You have to go to the store like an adult.\n\nYou also have a weird, backwards take on why it was okay for the gf to be insulting and for the roommate to condone it.", "I'm waffling between agreeing with you and thinking that OP isn't an AH. \n\nI've had similar situations occur, where someone thinks I'm weirdly overprepared, but then they are in a situation where they could really use my supplies. A simple \"Hey, I get it now, I'm sorry I made fun of it before, can I borrow your XYZ?\"\n\nSure, no problem, now you see there's a reason why I come prepared. I'm happy to help.\n\nBut if there's no acknowledgment or humility, just a demand to share, then I don't want to help someone who riduculed me and shows no remorse. \n\nSo, for me, it depends on if there was some form of apology from the roommate and his GF, or if they came in and just said, \"Hey, give me some of the stuff that I called you creepy and gross for, and no, there will be no apology or thank you, just give me your stuff!\"", "she can get bent mate, what you're doing is a service to your friends, witha \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy for their comfort, at your own expense\n\nI have a wife, a mother and a sister, if they have a friend like you I would be incredibly thankful to you for been of such help and because you're not a creep about it, keep it up!! you're solid as F", "In that case, I would have given her some period products, with the understanding that unless she stops her \"creepy\" comments, there will not be anymore in the future.\n\nSo, a little ESH, with you being the smallest AH in this scenario.", "Yeah you\u2019re all good. Refusing at that point would have been cruel, but that\u2019s neither here nor there seeing as they got them on time anyway.", "I didn't say there was.\n\nI said some people were not comfortable with it.  The person in OP's story is apparently one of them, considering the remarks she made about it.\n\nI've got a box of pads in my trunk for the same reason as OP, so maybe try not attacking your allies, hmmm?", "> You also have a weird, backwards take on why it was okay for the gf to be insulting and for the roommate to condone it.\n\nPlease point me to where I said it was okay for them to have done it.\n\nThere is a difference between understanding where someone is coming from, and accepting it as appropriate.\n\nMy verdict was that EVERYONE sucks, precisely because of what they did NOT being appropriate.  But just because they were an ass about it doesn't justify OP being an ass in return.  It just means there are two asses here.", "He tried to apologize but she didn't let him, she just asked: where is the stuff in your bathroom?", "IMO, the correct answer here is to be the bigger person, the first time.\n\nLet them have it.  See if they apologize/change their ways/etc.  If they don't, THEN you have a legitimate reason to deny them the next time.", "Nah, OP is in the clear. \n\nShe's a guest in his home, but not his guest. There was zero reason for her to be shitty with OP. She accuses him of being some kind of pervert regularly. She has not apologized for insulting him in his own home.\n\nThere is no reason why OP should go out of his way to make her welcome at this point.", "I think I miss understanded your question in the moment they didn't apologize, I know he tried by the way he looked but she didn't let him. He apologized to me the next day then she went home and I had a conversation about it with him. But I still accept that I am somewhat of a asshole", "\"so maybe try not attacking your allies, hmmm?\"\n\nhahahaha the roomie GF was the one attacking her \"ally\" per your logic, even if you're not comfortable approaching the subject, you don't berate a person for being F'ing nice just to be called a pervert and gross, she wasn't even nice when she ask him about \"borrowing\" something (because is she also expect to just use the thing without replenish them, she is even worse)\n\nall I'm saying in the end, if she was F'ing uncomfortable, she should just kept her trap shut! he wasn't doing anyones harm by keeping a F'ing stash for his friends, having a policy of \"don't ask, don't tell\" about so his friends could feel safe and comfortable without disclosing her period with anybody", "Yeah, don't listen to this crap OP. These people think that you need to be a doormat to people who are unreasonably rude to you over you being nice to your friends. \n\nThis person is not your friend and they have repeatedly disrespected you in your own home. You have zero reasons to put yourself out for them. \n\nMaybe next time they will be nicer to someone instead of being an asshole over some weird hang up that they have", "His gf is an absolute AH. She needs to stop coming over if she can't be moderately polite. I'd have a talk with your roommate.", "That sounds actually like the best solution, and probably what I would rather do. \n\nI've been in the situation where someone made fun of my preparedness, but then apologized, so I was happy to help out and get them out of a jam. \n\nBut I've never been in the situation where things were just demanded without some kind of apology. I think I would, as you said, help the first time and then not again if there was no apology.", "And is there some point in all of this where \"Everybody Sucks Here\" changed it's meaning?\n\nWhat she did was wrong.  What OP did was also wrong.  Hence \"Everybody Sucks Here\".", "I already had a conversation with him. He is really a good guy and friend. I know him since I'm 15, his only problem is that he never had a backbone when it came to his girlfriends", "I get it but for me he was an asshole, she is not entitled to his thing because of a \"emergency\", also in another comment, OP said that she demanded the stuff, not even ask for it nicely, if someone called me a gross pervert man and then demanded my help, I would for certain told them to F themselves, why should he be the bigger person and graceful? he could have loose some friends because of her\n\nthat's why I don't agree with you, in the case of OP, if you respect people is not out of this world, to expect a little respect back, she lacks basic human courtesy", "He's not a good guy or friend if he condones her behavior. Allowing her to continually come into your home and insult you without saying anything to her or refusing to invite her back if she can't behave, is condoning her behavior. \n\nWhy can't he see his gf at her house and leave you in peace?", "If he was justified in being an asshole back or not is not the question or the purpose of this sub.\n\nThe question was \"Was OP the asshole in the situation described\" and \"Someone needed something I could easily supply, but don't like them so I flaunted in their face that they couldn't have it and made them scramble in a panic\" is a dick move.  It just is."]}
