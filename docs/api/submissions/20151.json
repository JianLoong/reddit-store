It's summer break where I live. Two days ago my son \\[12\\] and his friend \\[also 12\\] came up with plans to go to a movie during the day. I work remotely and all the other parents have jobs that are in person. So, in what I thought was a nice gesture, I volunteered to drop them off at the movies. I knew I could plan a 15-30 minute break into my day. The friend rode his bike over a few hours before the movie. They're 12 so I was paying attention to what they were doing but I wasn't being overly watchful. Also, I was working.\n\nAnyway, they were up in my son's room playing Xbox and then running around the yard. I looked out to see they're both jumping in the pool in their clothes. I wasn't annoyed, I just figured \"whatever they're 12\" and then I realized they needed to be at this movie in about a half hour. I went out and said \"Are you guys still going to the movie?\" and they said yes. I pointed out that going to a movie soaking wet is a bad idea. I told my son to get changed and had his friend put on a set of my son's clothes. I took them to the movie, put the friend's clothes in the dryer while they were at the movie and then put them in a bag for him to take home. I felt like an awesome dad. I still managed to get my work done, dropped the kids off at a movie, made sure they weren't soaking wet and picked them up from the movie. I got all that done before 4 p.m. To me that felt like an achievement.\n\nMy wife got home from work and said she was getting texts from the other mom. Basically, she was asking why her son was wearing our son's clothes and then, after talking to her son, heard the full story. She related that to my wife and I pretty much said \"Yep, that is how it happened\". Her take and the other mom's take was that I was irresponsible. A direct quote from my wife was \"Why did you let them go in the pool?\" I was annoyed at this point...I said I didn't let them do anything, I was working, they jumped in and then I took care of the situation. Somehow that snowballed into I have it so easy working from home and I need to do a better job of watching what our son and his friends do.\n\nAm I the asshole? Things have been tense between us for the past two days and I feel like I should apologize just to make things OK. At the same time, I want her to to apologize to me and say \"Thank you for working full time and watching the kids\".\n\n\\[edited for spacing\\]", "created_utc": 1687267228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14eazoq/aita_for_working_from_home_and_not_watching_my/", "score": 384, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were the opposite of \"irresponsible\". If anything, you should've asked your son and his friend if it was a smart idea to go to see a movie soaking wet and have them figure out what they should do from that point instead of telling them to change, put their clothes in the dryer, etc.   \n\n\nWhat exactly was \"irresponsible\" from the friend's mom POV?!", "NTA. \n\nYes, it was stupid they jumped in the pool - but it\u2019s what 12 year olds do. He should be old enough to not need a babysitter/be micromanaged. You handled the situation as anyone would have. \n\nYou were home working and there if an emergency happened. You also got them there and home from the movie.", "Work from home here too, why do people think that working from home means we have the day off? I still have scheduled breaks and time I need to be productive, still being managed, still need to actually work \ud83e\udee0 you\u2019re not the asshole at all. I always express to my husband, imagine trying to do xyz while also doing abc, could you manage that? Being home doesn\u2019t mean you have the day off. I\u2019m micromanaged harder being work from home lol", "NTA. 12 years old isn't 4 years old. The boys knew full well jumping in the pool *with their clothes on* was beyond stupid and obnoxious. IMO you would've been entirely justified to refuse to take them to the movie, because really! They knew better, and took advantage of the fact you were working to play up whilst you were completely understandably occupied during your workday.\n\nOf course then you'd have been stuck with 2 wet, sulky 12-year-olds whilst trying to complete your workday.\n\nYou did a favor and got taken advantage of, then got shit for it. NTA, and I'd suggest making it clear WFH acronym leads with the W meaning WORKING.", "NTA - cool. Don\u2019t expect me to provide rides for your kid or have them over at my house while you\u2019re working then. If you want childcare for your kid, organize it and pay for it.", "NTA of course. They are 12, you can't really be expected, or should be expected to follow a couple 12-year-old boys around even *if* you weren't working. \n\nMaybe talk to your wife about making pool rules when kids are over for your son as a way to mitigate the issue.", "NTA. Imo, you handled it well.", "NTA \n\nAt 12 the kids are old enough to not need constant supervision,  especially when you are working. \n\nBut at the same time, no kid should be in the pool without letting an adult know and be supervised. Including your son. Accidents can happen,  especially in a pool.", "NTA. They\u2019re 12, not 5! I can see why friend\u2019s mom would ask about wearing different clothes but I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s it such a big deal. Unless it\u2019s a matter of her son can\u2019t swim or something. Personally, I think she could of at least said thanks for letting my kid hang out all day and for getting them to and from the movies. Not to mention drying his clothes to bring home. I would of if it was my child!", "NTA - My son is 18 and I'm telling you now, boys will be boys. It's not like they asked you for permission to get in the pool before they did it. You stopped them, got them ready for the movie and dried the other kid's clothes. I think you did the right thing and honestly I'm shocked that anyone was upset by this.\n\nI also don't see how you did anything wrong, and all those people who think that because you're working from home means that you have an easy job can get over it. It's still work, regardless as to where it happens. Yes, a little appreciation is in order here.", "NTA you did everything you could. Don\u2019t volunteer to do that again. You did great, you should feel like an awesome dad. You deserve that", "NTA. I wouldn't expect 12 year olds to need constant supervision. I have 2 8 year olds here today and I'm not hovering. \n\nWhat are the rules about going in the pool in general? Are they allowed to without asking or without supervision?", "NTA. The pool could be a bit touchy for some parents, but now you know. \n\nI just also want to point out that this seems a bit one-sided for the moms to think you should be supervising two 12 year old boys nonstop. Where I live it\u2019s common for 12-13 year old girls to be left babysitting even smaller children. If these were girls I doubt they\u2019d think twice.", "Your wife doesn't respect you working from home. Is she always this rigid and judgemental?

They don't need constant supervision. You did fine, and have nothing to apologize for. NTA.", "Mate.. NTA\nI knew the exact layout of my friends wardrobes because of how often we got soaking wet/super dirty while playing as kids, but this was the 90s so probably more chill?\nYou did great. Don't sweat it.", "NTA - I think the problem here starts with \"his friend rode his bike over a few hours before the movie\". I think that you need to be clear with other parents that you working from home does not make your house free childcare for the summer. And if kids are there (including your own), the parental supervision is going to be limited. If other parents (including your wife) want someone to watch the kids full time during the summer, then someone needs to be hired to do that.", "NTA - it's so weird anyone is upset about this incident. They jumped in the pool - theyre kids having fun. Kind of annoying for figuring out the plans, but everything worked out fine, no harm no foul. I do not understand the kind of parent who is actively mad that any of this happened??", "NTA! You dried the clothes. Who GAF?! You did great OP bro!", "NTA. They're TWELVE, not toddlers. Constant surveillance isn't necessary or appropriate.", "I would put my foot down. Tell them that for now on you are to busy for child care. Tell your wife to hire a nanny or deal with it herself. You have a job. It's not your fault that your job is wfh (or it is idk) and wfh dose not mean you can just skirt work responsibilities. NTA", "NTA It's understandable that you're feeling conflicted and unsure about the situation. From your account, it seems like you acted in good faith and made a reasonable effort to accommodate your son and his friend's plans while managing your work responsibilities. However, misunderstandings and differing perspectives can lead to tension in relationships, as seems to be the case here.\r It's important to approach this situation with open communication and empathy. Instead of focusing on assigning blame or demanding an apology, try to initiate a calm and constructive conversation with your wife. Share your perspective, emphasizing that you had work obligations but still did your best to ensure the boys' safety and comfort. Explain your reasoning behind allowing them to use the pool, and express that you didn't anticipate the situation escalating in a way that would impact their movie plans.\r Listen attentively to your wife's concerns and try to understand her perspective as well. Perhaps she was worried about the safety of the boys or felt that there was a lack of supervision. Acknowledge her feelings and concerns, even if you may not fully agree with them. Engage in a dialogue to find common ground and identify any miscommunications or misconceptions that may have contributed to the tension.\r Ultimately, the goal should be to find a resolution that promotes understanding and strengthens your relationship. Apologizing can be a valuable gesture, not necessarily to accept blame for something you genuinely believe wasn't entirely your fault, but rather to acknowledge any unintended consequences or misunderstandings that occurred. An apology can help diffuse tension and demonstrate your willingness to maintain a positive and supportive environment within your family.\r Remember, healthy relationships require ongoing communication, empathy, and compromise. By approaching the situation with understanding and a desire to find a solution, you can work towards resolving the tension and rebuilding harmony within your family.", "NAH\n\nSeems like a good time to talk through all your summer plans and expectations.  \n\nBecause you have a pool, you and your wife need to agree to and write out a safety plan and rules surrounding it\u2019s use.  Pools present an inherent risk.  I raised three sons, all of while were smart and reasonably reliable.  All of the could swim well.  However, there is something about having another boy that age around that makes them more inclined to do dumb, risky things and less inclined to use their common sense than when they are alone.  The level of supervision your son needs around the pool will rise significantly when another kid is in the mix.  While you may trust him to be on the pool deck and even cool off in the water when alone, when a friend is over, you might want to have the gate locked of you can\u2019t directly supervise. I think most parents would expect you to actively supervise kids in the pool.  If you can\u2019t do that, keep it locked.  \n\nIf your wife wants a higher level of supervision in general, you may need to hire a sitter.  It seems dumb to me because most 12 year olds are perfectly safe around the house with a parent home, even if the parent is occupied doing other things.  But you have to talk with her and figure out what she really wants and expects, and be honest about what you are able to provide.  There will be dumb things that happen - falls off a bike, a jump in the pool, a ball through a window.  Those things happen whether you work or not, unless you micromanage the living hell out of a child.  Its not fair for her to rebuke for being negligent when things like that happen.   Your wife needs to understand exactly what you can and can not offer, and if she isn\u2019t satisfied, she needs to be part of creating a solution.", "NTA\n\nSo both mothers think that it is perfectly acceptable for two 12 year olds to go to watch a film in a cinema with lots of unknown people with no supervision but NOT acceptable for someone WORKING at home to take his eyes off said kids while they are in a domestic environment with no stranger danger?  Yes the kids were idiots jumping into the pool but you took a sensible approach to dealing with the situation (which was not one you would have been able to anticipate).  Tell them that you blame the mothers for not instilling common sense in the boys.", "INFO.  Has this friend been over before?   Do you know this kid? If this is a new friend I think paying attention during the first visit, explaining rules, etc is smart.  All that means taking time off work. \n\nBut really they are 12 and should not need constant supervision. And they got to the movies and were fine.  So I lean toward NTA \n\nExcept if this is a kid who you didn\u2019t really know who hadn\u2019t been in your house before I think a little more vigilance is reasonable. Another variable is how assertive your son is and how he would react to any inappropriate behavior.  If your son is timid, or wild himself, being more vigilant during the first visit or two may be smart.   \n\nYou can\u2019t work and do that though.  Take turns taking time off work if this is what is required, because working from home is work. If you do it right you are actually doing work, not micromanaging pre teens.\n\nEdit: autocorrect weirdness", "NTA but I get the impression this mom was trying to gauge the level of supervision at the house and how she needs to address it with her son going forward. I don\u2019t think she handled it well though. For instance our neighbor has a pool. Their kids are ages all around my two kids ages. I wouldn\u2019t be happy if my almost 12 year old came home wet and I found out the adult didn\u2019t know they were in the pool. Not because of supervision issues but because I would like to discuss proper boundaries with my kid like not jumping in a pool just because it\u2019s there, asking the adult first. \n\nI also work from home as do a handful of my kids friends and I don\u2019t expect the level of supervision it seems this mother expected. Maybe that\u2019s just a me vs them thing, but I don\u2019t see anything happening as lack of supervision. However as someone posted above, an open conversation would be helpful for all parties. Perhaps this mom is very worried about water safety. Perhaps she expects a level of supervision greater than you do. All are valid but without an understanding it\u2019s hard to blame anyone for expectations", "Info - They weren't in the pool unsupervised right? You got them out once they jumped in?", "EDIT ESH you technically didn't volunteer to watch them you volunteered to drop them off at the movies. Meaning the other boy shouldn't have been allowed over until closer to the movie. Bad communication between the adults. It's not that the boys went in with their clothes it's that you didn't watch them. As you said you \"didn't allow them in the pool they went in\". 12 is not 6 but accidents can happen very quickly in all cases and pool accidents can lead to drowning. You were working so it makes sense that you could not watch them in the pool. So you should have told them not to go in the pool when the friend got there or said you can't fully supervise because you are working. \n\n\n\nINFO are the other mom and your wife mad that the clothes got wet or that they were unsupervised in the pool? I can understand being worried about 12 year olds alone in the pool. Accidents happen and drowning or injury can happen in seconds.", "[deleted]", "YTA only for the pool part.\n\nEverything else you seem to get an \"awesome dad\" award.\n\nBut the pool was a a glaring oversight.

And I hope you spoke very seriously with your son about him breaking that rule? 12 is still too young to be in the pool, especially roughhousing with a friend, unattended.

Good lord at 12 during the summers our parents kicked us out of the house after breakfast, and told us when dinner was and basically to not bother them till then, and we were running the streets and all managed to survive into adulthood just fine. \n\nHOWEVER, the part for me is the pool thing.  Yeah, kids going in a pool unsupervised is kind of...not okay.  Clothes or not clothes, they should not be in the pool unless there's an adult literally there fast enough to save a kid from drowning.  We knew that if a friend had a pool and we wanted a dip we had to run inside and ask whoever was home if we could and normally it was Mrs Jones and she'd say sure and get herself a glass of lemonade and a novel and sit out by the pool to watch us.  It's just not safe to let little ones in the pool alone.

We occasionally would board dogs in our home. I would work upstairs since I have to talk with people for my job. My husband would be downstairs since he is just reading things on the computer.\n\nWhen we had a guest dog, he was doing most of the work looking after them. The dogs would rarely behave as well as their owners say they do in their own home. So, my husband got frustrated (rightly so) and we stopped boarding dogs in our home.

Setting some firm boundaries is important especially in terms of communication and safety. OP sounds awesome to kids -- and a bit permissive. Friend arrives several hours early, and from the sounds of it, neither kid checked to see if it was okay that friend was there. Even if they did, OP never clearly set any boundaries, like you guys are responsible for watching the time and being ready to leave for the movie. \n\nSecondly, do you guys have common sense pool rules? Running, rough housing, etc near pool, especially without supervision isn't great, and being in the pool without supervision or telling the adults that's the plan isn't great either, especially since OP is responsible for the friend. My guess is these rules *do* exist in OP's family because being responsible for other people's kids is no joke. \n\nInstead of checking the kids boundary pushing, OP enabled it. The consequences for stupid are, you crossed the line, your clothes are wet, and you want to leave in 15 minutes...that doesnt work, no rescue for you, also, since kid and kid's friend can't respect the pool rules, then friend needs to go home. \n\nOP's wife has a real concern-- OP did not set boundaries or enforce the ones in place. The kids were reckless and unsupervised and had no consequences, and made her job harder the next time she has to enforce boundaries. That sad, she crossed a line when she went after OP's job and that he doesn't have it hard, etc. \n\nESH", "My husband works from home.

I might've not handled the situation right but I handled it the best I could", "That's a fair point and something I'll discuss with my wife when she gets home", "Thanks! I feel the same way. When I was a kid and there were tons of things we weren't supposed to do unless my folks were around...but in the summer we did all of them and just never told them about it. I want him to have memories and feel safe telling me what he's been up to", "you did watch them for the day. They're 12. They don't need constant supervision.", "Is this another case of a person working from home (as I do), and the spouse not fully understanding that they are *working*?  I see many posts where the spouse thinks that just because someone is working from home, that they can be doing all sorts of other household tasks.\n\nMy grandkids sometimes spend the day at the house.  My office is upstairs.  They are too young to be in the pool without supervision (although they call can swim), so they are great at watching TV or letting me know if they need something.  But, even the kids know that I am working and not playing.", "I was babysitting an infant when I was 11. You did nothing wrong. 12 year olds should plan ahead before they jump in the pool in their clothes. Let the other mom take care of your kid next time.", "At 12 years old, \"watching him for the day\" means you're around to take him to the hospital if he breaks his arm. 12 year olds can take care of themselves. NTA at all and don't apologize.", "bot comment stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14eazoq/comment/jotygx4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "I tried to work from home and watch my toddler once.  I think I answered 2 emails that day.  That was the extent that I got done.  Luckily, I work for myself.  Any time I need to watch my toddler now due to daycare being closed, I just split the work for day before and after.", "Nope. No friends over. Your son showed he wasnt mature enough to have guests when you are working. Your wife isnt smart enough to grasp WFH means you are working. No friends  over during WFH is an easy fix to both problems.", "If they are best friends over all the time, NTA in my opinion.", "When I was 12 I used to take the bus to the actual beach. Not always lifeguards in those days either.", "You seem pretty lackadaisical about water safety, OP. If you don\u2019t know how his parents feel about their child being unsupervised in a pool, you haven\u2019t been \u2018responsible\u2019; you just haven\u2019t asked the right questions.\n\nAnd neither did the other parents. If they were leaving their child at your house for the day, they should have asked about the circumstances ahead of time; knowing that you were working, their assumption that you\u2019d be monitoring a pair of twelve-year-olds is absurd. ESH.\n\neta: I live on the water, which is why we have a $1M liability policy. The commenters who are making light of the pool situation either have confirmation bias (\u2018I did it so it must be fine\u2019), or they don\u2019t understand how quickly kids horsing around in a pool can get themselves into trouble. My kids were free to roam the countryside and got into all kinds of scrapes, but it anyone broke a water safety rule, punishment was swift. Don\u2019t fuck around with water. It\u2019s not worth the risk.", "I mean if I was a dad I would\u2019ve done the same.. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I'm supposed to have my ass in my chair during office hours.", "Not sure why you're getting downvoted. At least in the US, this is correct.", "Agreed...if they had come inside beforehand and told me I would have advised against it. To be honest I find the whole situation silly but we'll get it sorted out", "At that age, I was also at the beach and other water ways.  I was also a decent swimmer and only swam with a buddy. \n\nWe have no idea on this kid though. Or the other parents comfort level with a pool. Even at 12 I might insist on adult supervision for a household pool. And an adult working at home is not adequate for that.  I'm still years away from making those decisions about my kid so it's hard to say.", "Yeah, me too. And a kid in my class drowned when we were in the 8th grade. Some of the differences between our childhoods and today are helicopter parenting, but some of them are sensible, necessary safety measures we should have had when we were kids, too.", "That's fair. It's not that we haven't taught them have pool safety but I don't know how his parents feel about it (perhaps I do now) but I understand how you come to that assessment.", "Any parent who thinks 12 year olds need eyes on them all the times is deeply troubled. OP said he would watch them *while working from home*.  The other mom has issues. That said. Never have that kid over again as he broke the rules.", "Just make sure you don\u2019t bother doing that mom any more favors, she obviously doesn\u2019t appreciate it.  And what would he have been doing if not at your house? At his house alone\u2026 Even less monitored?", "Agreed. I was regularly babysitting other kids at that age.", "You don't owe an apology but I get just giving one to move on... I would let this mother know that you are working and in the future her son will not be able to come over during your working hours....that poor kid is going to lose friends BC of his Mom, that is for sure!", "Wtf? Sorry, but this has nothing to do with the actions of your son and YWBTA if you even implied as such to him. \n\nSo they jumped in the pool, who gives a shit? If they didn\u2019t want to go to the movie or forgot or whatever, that isn\u2019t a big deal at all. Your son\u2019s actions did not create this problem. In any event, you solved the pool \u201cissue\u201d by getting them dried off and in new clothes. \n\nYour wife and other mom did by helicopter parenting. And to be honest, you are compounding the issue by being spineless. Imagine the trauma you are placing on your son if he is asking if you are getting divorced over this stupid shit. And you are going to make it worse by implying he did something wrong??? Yes, it was stupid to jump in the pool fully clothed. That is not the issue here in the slightest and you should tell him as much.", "I don't think you needs eyes on 12 year olds at all times I do think watching them in the pool is a good idea. OP should talk with his wife and explain he only had the ability to drop them off not supervise them because he was working.\n\nAt the same time if it was me, and for whatever reason I couldn't get the kid to go back home until it was time to leave, when I heard the boys in the pool I would have told them to get out because I can't watch them. Then I would talk to the friend's mom and explain the miscommunication.", "This!!!  They\u2019re fucking 12, not 2!", "If your wife wants a higher level of supervision in general, you may need to hire a sitter. It seems dumb to me because most 12 year olds are perfectly safe around the house with a parent home, even if the parent is occupied doing other things. But you have to talk with her and figure out what she really wants and expects,", "I would let this mother know that you are working and in the future her son will not be able to come over during your working hours.", "[removed]", "Yeah, I would agree with that. No poop without an adult around. What I don't understand is that if this kid is allowed to ride his bike over to a friends house unsupervised, what makes the mom think someone is going to have eyes on the same kid the entire time they are at a friends house.", "Not just him though. He could have very easily placed just as much blame on the other parents for just assuming that he would be watching the kids. He had not agreed to that.", "Where I live 12 year olds can babysit. My 12 year old and 10 year old are perfectly capable of being home alone. They shouldn\u2019t need supervision at that age.", "Did she want you to hold their hands in case they needed to use the bathrooms while at the movies,", "He got to op's house on his own, so I agree. The mom clearly felt he was responsible enough to be alone on the streets or whatever so why should op feel he needs to hover over them while in his home.", "Apologise, but now that the situation clear let them know that the next time they want to do anything, either the friend's mother or your spouse has to take the day off work and watch the boys *all day*.", "Yes that's what I said bad communication from all the adults. The friend's mom should have gotten confirmation on when to send her kid over. Because he shouldn't have been over that early. Whoever talked to the friend's mom OP or OP's wife, should have been clear that OP is only dropping them off not watching them before."]}
