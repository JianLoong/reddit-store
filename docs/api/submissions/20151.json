It's summer break where I live. Two days ago my son \\[12\\] and his friend \\[also 12\\] came up with plans to go to a movie during the day. I work remotely and all the other parents have jobs that are in person. So, in what I thought was a nice gesture, I volunteered to drop them off at the movies. I knew I could plan a 15-30 minute break into my day. The friend rode his bike over a few hours before the movie. They're 12 so I was paying attention to what they were doing but I wasn't being overly watchful. Also, I was working.\n\nAnyway, they were up in my son's room playing Xbox and then running around the yard. I looked out to see they're both jumping in the pool in their clothes. I wasn't annoyed, I just figured \"whatever they're 12\" and then I realized they needed to be at this movie in about a half hour. I went out and said \"Are you guys still going to the movie?\" and they said yes. I pointed out that going to a movie soaking wet is a bad idea. I told my son to get changed and had his friend put on a set of my son's clothes. I took them to the movie, put the friend's clothes in the dryer while they were at the movie and then put them in a bag for him to take home. I felt like an awesome dad. I still managed to get my work done, dropped the kids off at a movie, made sure they weren't soaking wet and picked them up from the movie. I got all that done before 4 p.m. To me that felt like an achievement.\n\nMy wife got home from work and said she was getting texts from the other mom. Basically, she was asking why her son was wearing our son's clothes and then, after talking to her son, heard the full story. She related that to my wife and I pretty much said \"Yep, that is how it happened\". Her take and the other mom's take was that I was irresponsible. A direct quote from my wife was \"Why did you let them go in the pool?\" I was annoyed at this point...I said I didn't let them do anything, I was working, they jumped in and then I took care of the situation. Somehow that snowballed into I have it so easy working from home and I need to do a better job of watching what our son and his friends do.\n\nAm I the asshole? Things have been tense between us for the past two days and I feel like I should apologize just to make things OK. At the same time, I want her to to apologize to me and say \"Thank you for working full time and watching the kids\".\n\n\\[edited for spacing\\]", "created_utc": 1687267228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14eazoq/aita_for_working_from_home_and_not_watching_my/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were the opposite of \"irresponsible\". If anything, you should've asked your son and his friend if it was a smart idea to go to see a movie soaking wet and have them figure out what they should do from that point instead of telling them to change, put their clothes in the dryer, etc.   \n\n\nWhat exactly was \"irresponsible\" from the friend's mom POV?!", "NTA. \n\nYes, it was stupid they jumped in the pool - but it\u2019s what 12 year olds do. He should be old enough to not need a babysitter/be micromanaged. You handled the situation as anyone would have. \n\nYou were home working and there if an emergency happened. You also got them there and home from the movie.", "Work from home here too, why do people think that working from home means we have the day off? I still have scheduled breaks and time I need to be productive, still being managed, still need to actually work \ud83e\udee0 you\u2019re not the asshole at all. I always express to my husband, imagine trying to do xyz while also doing abc, could you manage that? Being home doesn\u2019t mean you have the day off. I\u2019m micromanaged harder being work from home lol", "NTA. 12 years old isn't 4 years old. The boys knew full well jumping in the pool *with their clothes on* was beyond stupid and obnoxious. IMO you would've been entirely justified to refuse to take them to the movie, because really! They knew better, and took advantage of the fact you were working to play up whilst you were completely understandably occupied during your workday.\n\nOf course then you'd have been stuck with 2 wet, sulky 12-year-olds whilst trying to complete your workday.\n\nYou did a favor and got taken advantage of, then got shit for it. NTA, and I'd suggest making it clear WFH acronym leads with the W meaning WORKING.", "NTA - cool. Don\u2019t expect me to provide rides for your kid or have them over at my house while you\u2019re working then. If you want childcare for your kid, organize it and pay for it.", "NTA of course. They are 12, you can't really be expected, or should be expected to follow a couple 12-year-old boys around even *if* you weren't working. \n\nMaybe talk to your wife about making pool rules when kids are over for your son as a way to mitigate the issue.", "NTA. Imo, you handled it well.", "NTA \n\nAt 12 the kids are old enough to not need constant supervision,  especially when you are working. \n\nBut at the same time, no kid should be in the pool without letting an adult know and be supervised. Including your son. Accidents can happen,  especially in a pool.", "NTA. They\u2019re 12, not 5! I can see why friend\u2019s mom would ask about wearing different clothes but I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s it such a big deal. Unless it\u2019s a matter of her son can\u2019t swim or something. Personally, I think she could of at least said thanks for letting my kid hang out all day and for getting them to and from the movies. Not to mention drying his clothes to bring home. I would of if it was my child!", "NTA - My son is 18 and I'm telling you now, boys will be boys. It's not like they asked you for permission to get in the pool before they did it. You stopped them, got them ready for the movie and dried the other kid's clothes. I think you did the right thing and honestly I'm shocked that anyone was upset by this.\n\nI also don't see how you did anything wrong, and all those people who think that because you're working from home means that you have an easy job can get over it. It's still work, regardless as to where it happens. Yes, a little appreciation is in order here.", "NTA you did everything you could. Don\u2019t volunteer to do that again. You did great, you should feel like an awesome dad. You deserve that", "NTA. I wouldn't expect 12 year olds to need constant supervision. I have 2 8 year olds here today and I'm not hovering. \n\nWhat are the rules about going in the pool in general? Are they allowed to without asking or without supervision?", "NTA. The pool could be a bit touchy for some parents, but now you know. \n\nI just also want to point out that this seems a bit one-sided for the moms to think you should be supervising two 12 year old boys nonstop. Where I live it\u2019s common for 12-13 year old girls to be left babysitting even smaller children. If these were girls I doubt they\u2019d think twice.", "Your wife doesn't respect you working from home. Is she always this rigid and judgemental?

They don't need constant supervision. You did fine, and have nothing to apologize for. NTA.", "Mate.. NTA\nI knew the exact layout of my friends wardrobes because of how often we got soaking wet/super dirty while playing as kids, but this was the 90s so probably more chill?\nYou did great. Don't sweat it.", "NTA - I think the problem here starts with \"his friend rode his bike over a few hours before the movie\". I think that you need to be clear with other parents that you working from home does not make your house free childcare for the summer. And if kids are there (including your own), the parental supervision is going to be limited. If other parents (including your wife) want someone to watch the kids full time during the summer, then someone needs to be hired to do that.", "NTA - it's so weird anyone is upset about this incident. They jumped in the pool - theyre kids having fun. Kind of annoying for figuring out the plans, but everything worked out fine, no harm no foul. I do not understand the kind of parent who is actively mad that any of this happened??", "NTA! You dried the clothes. Who GAF?! You did great OP bro!", "NTA. They're TWELVE, not toddlers. Constant surveillance isn't necessary or appropriate.", "I would put my foot down. Tell them that for now on you are to busy for child care. Tell your wife to hire a nanny or deal with it herself. You have a job. It's not your fault that your job is wfh (or it is idk) and wfh dose not mean you can just skirt work responsibilities. NTA", "NTA It's understandable that you're feeling conflicted and unsure about the situation. From your account, it seems like you acted in good faith and made a reasonable effort to accommodate your son and his friend's plans while managing your work responsibilities. However, misunderstandings and differing perspectives can lead to tension in relationships, as seems to be the case here.\r It's important to approach this situation with open communication and empathy. Instead of focusing on assigning blame or demanding an apology, try to initiate a calm and constructive conversation with your wife. Share your perspective, emphasizing that you had work obligations but still did your best to ensure the boys' safety and comfort. Explain your reasoning behind allowing them to use the pool, and express that you didn't anticipate the situation escalating in a way that would impact their movie plans.\r Listen attentively to your wife's concerns and try to understand her perspective as well. Perhaps she was worried about the safety of the boys or felt that there was a lack of supervision. Acknowledge her feelings and concerns, even if you may not fully agree with them. Engage in a dialogue to find common ground and identify any miscommunications or misconceptions that may have contributed to the tension.\r Ultimately, the goal should be to find a resolution that promotes understanding and strengthens your relationship. Apologizing can be a valuable gesture, not necessarily to accept blame for something you genuinely believe wasn't entirely your fault, but rather to acknowledge any unintended consequences or misunderstandings that occurred. An apology can help diffuse tension and demonstrate your willingness to maintain a positive and supportive environment within your family.\r Remember, healthy relationships require ongoing communication, empathy, and compromise. By approaching the situation with understanding and a desire to find a solution, you can work towards resolving the tension and rebuilding harmony within your family.", "NAH\n\nSeems like a good time to talk through all your summer plans and expectations.  \n\nBecause you have a pool, you and your wife need to agree to and write out a safety plan and rules surrounding it\u2019s use.  Pools present an inherent risk.  I raised three sons, all of while were smart and reasonably reliable.  All of the could swim well.  However, there is something about having another boy that age around that makes them more inclined to do dumb, risky things and less inclined to use their common sense than when they are alone.  The level of supervision your son needs around the pool will rise significantly when another kid is in the mix.  While you may trust him to be on the pool deck and even cool off in the water when alone, when a friend is over, you might want to have the gate locked of you can\u2019t directly supervise. I think most parents would expect you to actively supervise kids in the pool.  If you can\u2019t do that, keep it locked.  \n\nIf your wife wants a higher level of supervision in general, you may need to hire a sitter.  It seems dumb to me because most 12 year olds are perfectly safe around the house with a parent home, even if the parent is occupied doing other things.  But you have to talk with her and figure out what she really wants and expects, and be honest about what you are able to provide.  There will be dumb things that happen - falls off a bike, a jump in the pool, a ball through a window.  Those things happen whether you work or not, unless you micromanage the living hell out of a child.  Its not fair for her to rebuke for being negligent when things like that happen.   Your wife needs to understand exactly what you can and can not offer, and if she isn\u2019t satisfied, she needs to be part of creating a solution.", "NTA\n\nSo both mothers think that it is perfectly acceptable for two 12 year olds to go to watch a film in a cinema with lots of unknown people with no supervision but NOT acceptable for someone WORKING at home to take his eyes off said kids while they are in a domestic environment with no stranger danger?  Yes the kids were idiots jumping into the pool but you took a sensible approach to dealing with the situation (which was not one you would have been able to anticipate).  Tell them that you blame the mothers for not instilling common sense in the boys.", "INFO.  Has this friend been over before?   Do you know this kid? If this is a new friend I think paying attention during the first visit, explaining rules, etc is smart.  All that means taking time off work. \n\nBut really they are 12 and should not need constant supervision. And they got to the movies and were fine.  So I lean toward NTA \n\nExcept if this is a kid who you didn\u2019t really know who hadn\u2019t been in your house before I think a little more vigilance is reasonable. Another variable is how assertive your son is and how he would react to any inappropriate behavior.  If your son is timid, or wild himself, being more vigilant during the first visit or two may be smart.   \n\nYou can\u2019t work and do that though.  Take turns taking time off work if this is what is required, because working from home is work. If you do it right you are actually doing work, not micromanaging pre teens.\n\nEdit: autocorrect weirdness", "NTA but I get the impression this mom was trying to gauge the level of supervision at the house and how she needs to address it with her son going forward. I don\u2019t think she handled it well though. For instance our neighbor has a pool. Their kids are ages all around my two kids ages. I wouldn\u2019t be happy if my almost 12 year old came home wet and I found out the adult didn\u2019t know they were in the pool. Not because of supervision issues but because I would like to discuss proper boundaries with my kid like not jumping in a pool just because it\u2019s there, asking the adult first. \n\nI also work from home as do a handful of my kids friends and I don\u2019t expect the level of supervision it seems this mother expected. Maybe that\u2019s just a me vs them thing, but I don\u2019t see anything happening as lack of supervision. However as someone posted above, an open conversation would be helpful for all parties. Perhaps this mom is very worried about water safety. Perhaps she expects a level of supervision greater than you do. All are valid but without an understanding it\u2019s hard to blame anyone for expectations", "Info - They weren't in the pool unsupervised right? You got them out once they jumped in?", "EDIT ESH you technically didn't volunteer to watch them you volunteered to drop them off at the movies. Meaning the other boy shouldn't have been allowed over until closer to the movie. Bad communication between the adults. It's not that the boys went in with their clothes it's that you didn't watch them. As you said you \"didn't allow them in the pool they went in\". 12 is not 6 but accidents can happen very quickly in all cases and pool accidents can lead to drowning. You were working so it makes sense that you could not watch them in the pool. So you should have told them not to go in the pool when the friend got there or said you can't fully supervise because you are working. \n\n\n\nINFO are the other mom and your wife mad that the clothes got wet or that they were unsupervised in the pool? I can understand being worried about 12 year olds alone in the pool. Accidents happen and drowning or injury can happen in seconds.", "[deleted]", "YTA only for the pool part.\n\nEverything else you seem to get an \"awesome dad\" award.\n\nBut the pool was a a glaring oversight.

And I hope you spoke very seriously with your son about him breaking that rule? 12 is still too young to be in the pool, especially roughhousing with a friend, unattended.

Good lord at 12 during the summers our parents kicked us out of the house after breakfast, and told us when dinner was and basically to not bother them till then, and we were running the streets and all managed to survive into adulthood just fine. \n\nHOWEVER, the part for me is the pool thing.  Yeah, kids going in a pool unsupervised is kind of...not okay.  Clothes or not clothes, they should not be in the pool unless there's an adult literally there fast enough to save a kid from drowning.  We knew that if a friend had a pool and we wanted a dip we had to run inside and ask whoever was home if we could and normally it was Mrs Jones and she'd say sure and get herself a glass of lemonade and a novel and sit out by the pool to watch us.  It's just not safe to let little ones in the pool alone.

We occasionally would board dogs in our home. I would work upstairs since I have to talk with people for my job. My husband would be downstairs since he is just reading things on the computer.\n\nWhen we had a guest dog, he was doing most of the work looking after them. The dogs would rarely behave as well as their owners say they do in their own home. So, my husband got frustrated (rightly so) and we stopped boarding dogs in our home.

Setting some firm boundaries is important especially in terms of communication and safety. OP sounds awesome to kids -- and a bit permissive. Friend arrives several hours early, and from the sounds of it, neither kid checked to see if it was okay that friend was there. Even if they did, OP never clearly set any boundaries, like you guys are responsible for watching the time and being ready to leave for the movie. \n\nSecondly, do you guys have common sense pool rules? Running, rough housing, etc near pool, especially without supervision isn't great, and being in the pool without supervision or telling the adults that's the plan isn't great either, especially since OP is responsible for the friend. My guess is these rules *do* exist in OP's family because being responsible for other people's kids is no joke. \n\nInstead of checking the kids boundary pushing, OP enabled it. The consequences for stupid are, you crossed the line, your clothes are wet, and you want to leave in 15 minutes...that doesnt work, no rescue for you, also, since kid and kid's friend can't respect the pool rules, then friend needs to go home. \n\nOP's wife has a real concern-- OP did not set boundaries or enforce the ones in place. The kids were reckless and unsupervised and had no consequences, and made her job harder the next time she has to enforce boundaries. That sad, she crossed a line when she went after OP's job and that he doesn't have it hard, etc. \n\nESH", "My husband works from home.

I can multitask but not at the level she wants and tbh I HATE working from home...I'd rather he was just in day camp but that's not the situation", "Imo I took at as a lesson for them and I guess I don't know if that was right. I wanted them to understand it's summer and \"OK have fun\" but someone has to clean up after that fun. You're absolutely correct...my son's old enough to know better and he's been feeling guilty because this obviously created tension. It's such a weird situation and although I'm concerned how we're acting toward each other I'm concerned about how he's responding to it", "That's true. I'm going to approach it from that perspective. The past two days I think (from her view) I've been basically saying \"you realize I work righ??\" and I should probably just work with her to agree on ground rules for when friends are over.", "Yeah, that's the remark I was waiting for. It's a liability issue for sure.", "That's really good advice. I'm probably feeling resented and I'm not even sure why. So I appreciate the insight. Thank you", "That's a really pragmatic view. Thank you. I'm seeing from the replies I need to approach in that way", "They're best friends and they are over a lot. We're not close with the parents but enough that my wife can text the other \"Hey they want to go the park\" or vice versa.

Except for when they are in the pool. \n\nI really think that's the sticky point here.  Not so much that the kids didn't have constant supervision.  It's that they didn't have that in a pool situation.  Many families are much stricter regarding water safety.", "Very true ty. I'll ask my wife if she feels comfortable having a deeper discussion with the other mom. I would be willing to talk to his dad, we just don't have that type of relationship.", "It was more that they were \"allowed\" in the pool. That's why I told my wife they weren't allowed...they just went in. And that meant I wasn't watching them (which is fair) but its created this whole thing I don't want to be there", "Absolutely not. 12 is old enough to follow simple rules, such as don't jump in the pool while clothed. I was staying home alone summers at aged 12. NTA at all and if your son and friend can't follow simple rules, then no more coming over while you work. Because you are getting paid to work, not watch the kids.", "That's fair. That was a thing the other mom brought up.", "So two 12 year old boys got their cloths wet. What's the problem with that?", "But I agree with you...they shouldn't need a babysitter. They should manage themselves and I'd appreciate insight about the situation.", "Eh you're right especially on the last point. That was a thing that came up in our discussion. It is partially I was doing work but also when I saw them doing it I thought \"ong me and me bff would do the same\" I don't feel like a bad parent for letting that happen but I should be more reflective about it", "That was actually my point...I was in the middle of a meeting and had to go off cam/unmute to take care of what they were doing. Maybe it wasn't the best option but that's how I handled and I got really annoyed when they felt like I just had the space to do everything at one time", "He can now. He understands there's warning signs on it about diving...stuff like that. Honestly I don't know about the friend and maybe it's bad I don't know. But they've been friends since kindergarten and I felt like any concerns would have come up before. We've always been very responsible in watching them", "That's a very point and true. We had a family discussion but I don't think I brought it up from that perspective...I was still caught up in the moment", "its a fair point and tbh i didn't know they'd go all in the pool. it was a spontaneous thing", "Honestly I hate working from home  because everyone assumes I'm not working. And tbh it would be funny if I said that to the mom....her response would be something like \"but I\"m working?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n'bi\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni", "You generously provided free childcare for her kiddo *while you were at work*. \n\nThe kids are 12.

Instead she's deflecting and making it about you. \n\nNTA. You have nothing to apologize for. Mom who enjoyed free childcare thanks to you is the one who needs to cool down, apologize, and say thank you.", "Definitely NTA. Working remotely is still working and it\u2019s unfair for them to think that just cause you\u2019re home, you should be able to keep a super close eye on the kids. You handled the situation very well and did an excellent job balancing both work and making sure the kids were safe and able to see their movies appropriately (in dry clothes). It was especially generous of you to even offer taking them to the movies.

Did she want you to hold their hands in case they needed to use the bathrooms while at the movies, too?!  \n\n\n12 year olds are perfectly capable of watching a movie at the theater you dropped them off at all by themselves. Sooooo NTA.", "Dude, you're working.  You're not a babysitter and they're 12.  They should know better than to jump in the pool in their clothes pre-movie and it's nice that you still took them even though your drop off window was widened by putting his clothes in the dryer and making sure he had something to wear.  \n\nI wfh and my bosses have recently got a stick up their asses about my ass being in my chair from 9-5.  Doesn't matter if I'm back working at night or whatever, I'm supposed to have my ass in my chair during office hours.  Needless to say I'm bitter.\n\nTell your wife it won't happen again and she can tell your son that he's not allowed to have friends over or schedule things during your workday unless she takes time off to watch them.", "NTA\n\nIt's constant. Some people just don't understand working from home is the same as being in the office..it's just a different location. For me and those I know, working from home, we actually get more work done with less distractions if you can focus. The companies even recognize it! \n\nIt's just a vast under appreciation  that you're working and taking on some of the parental duties and other stuff at the same time. \n\nYour wife wasn't there! The other mom...wasn't there! You did what you could, made the best of it, noone was unsafe, everyone actually involved was happy at the end of the day.

Get this other mom to work from home and watch them. And you know what, they won't! They'll make excuses \"my work won't let me\", \"I can't\" or whatever. Or if they do do it, \"I didn't get anything done, I was watching the boys all day\". \n\nKids are 12, they are old enough to know better, they did it anyway, they had fun, everything got sorted fast(from soaking wet to changed and at the movies in under 30 mins). \n\nThe moms want it both ways, they can't have it, and they aren't willing to give it a try themselves.

I miss the connection of seeing people in office but it\u2019s best for my kids that I work from home because they\u2019re not of school age yet and we haven\u2019t found much reliable child care that we trust so I work from home while a babysitter is here with them to kinda oversee things. Not that I\u2019m a helicopter mom all the time, just they can\u2019t speak for or defend themselves yet and my husband and I have trauma from childhood experiences we want to keep them from lol", "Ask them if they would like to take two 12 year old boys to their job and if they could still work and watch them at the same time. Just because your desk is in your house and not in an office doesn't mean you aren't doing the same amount of work or expected to be there at set hours. \n\nYou could also explain that while your boss can't just walk in and find you aren't at your desk, they can monitor your computer activity and if they find you aren't working because you're watching kids they will be just as annoyed and find it just as unprofessional if you had brought those kids into the office and let them distract you there. \n\nMaybe you need more boundaries about your work day - no more additional childcare commitments, if your kid wants to see friends you might be able to take a break to drive him there, but you won't have them over while you're working if it's expected that you will be actively watching them.", "Let her read this post.

The kids were doing what kids do. Turning that into a lesson was the right move. \n\nI think have a good convo with your kiddo? What they did was dumb and obnoxious, yes, but it wasn't a capital crime and you still love him. If you and your son are cool, and he knows you're cool with his friend, it'll be all right. Friend's mom overreacted. It'll blow over.", "You need to talk to a lawyer. If you let a 12 year old kid into your house and he uses the pool without your supervision and something bad happens you say \"well, I was working so you can't hold me responsible\" I suspect that lawyer will tell you you're flat wrong.", "Well you weren't watching them and said that you would.", "I think that\u2019s just ridiculous. My best friend growing up had a pool and we got in the pool whenever we wanted, without having to ask.

He has soccer camp today but when I pick him up I'll bring it up in a way that makes him feel more secure. The last thing he said to me was \"you're getting divorced aren't you\"? and I laughed...no one is getting divorced over this.

He asked if we're getting divorced and I told him no....we've been through much worse before. Its not divorce stuff", "Where did he say he would watch them? He said he would drop them off at the movies.", "Ty. I should say we do have rules about the pool but its only about 5 feet deep. They are all much taller than that now. The rules *were* different when they were 6 years old but they've lived with these rules for several years now", "What you say is kinda condradicting. \n\nOn one side you repeatedly say that 12 year old shouldn't need a babysitter but on the other hand you blame OP for not being a babysitter that pays attention to the kids every move.", "You should set some stricter rules regarding the pool, especially when friends are over.  At the minimum, they need to let you know they are going swimming.  Preferably they wait until an adult can supervise.  Kids are dumb and do dumber things when they are in groups", "Agreed.  Most 12yos can look after themselves just fine -- they don't need constant monitoring like 5yos.   Yeah, 12yo boys are still derps and they did something dumb.   The other parent is probably embarrassed that their kid jumped into a pool fully clothed.    You don't owe her an apology.    I get the compulsion though.     If it makes \\*you\\* feel better to say 'Hey, I'm sorry there was some confusion, but I wasn't watching the kids, I was just around if they needed anything like the ride to the movie.'  then go for it.", "That's fair. An apology will probably go along way towards defusing the situation. But you're still not at fault here.", "They don\u2019t,  kids that age are going to do some stupid things, it\u2019s part of growing up.

You (and she) both know it's not divorce worthy but sounds like kid has bad anxiety due to mom's overreaction.", "Oh damn. You definitely need to have a conversation with her.

Parenting is more than watching your child. He is apparently allowed to take other children swimming without telling a parent. There is apparently no exoectation for this child to be mindful of things lile laundry or consequences of actions. \n\n\nThey seemed to not have a plan regarding their clothe and needed to be reminded of the time?", "we're both in the right and we should model that. ik we're both trying to do the best thing so ig it doesnt matter?", "I don't agree with you but I can see your point there!", "No, she and your wife are TAs. You said you'd take them to the movies, not babysit them. You were working and even though from home, it's no less than being in the office. They are the ones who expected you to babysit all day, then blame you for not doing something you never said you would do.\n\nThe comments from your wife are disgustingly disrespectful. You need to try talking to her and find out why she thinks your job is so much easier and unimportant. You don't want this to continue and her end up resentful over her misconception about working from home."]}
