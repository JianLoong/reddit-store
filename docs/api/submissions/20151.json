It's summer break where I live. Two days ago my son \\[12\\] and his friend \\[also 12\\] came up with plans to go to a movie during the day. I work remotely and all the other parents have jobs that are in person. So, in what I thought was a nice gesture, I volunteered to drop them off at the movies. I knew I could plan a 15-30 minute break into my day. The friend rode his bike over a few hours before the movie. They're 12 so I was paying attention to what they were doing but I wasn't being overly watchful. Also, I was working.\n\nAnyway, they were up in my son's room playing Xbox and then running around the yard. I looked out to see they're both jumping in the pool in their clothes. I wasn't annoyed, I just figured \"whatever they're 12\" and then I realized they needed to be at this movie in about a half hour. I went out and said \"Are you guys still going to the movie?\" and they said yes. I pointed out that going to a movie soaking wet is a bad idea. I told my son to get changed and had his friend put on a set of my son's clothes. I took them to the movie, put the friend's clothes in the dryer while they were at the movie and then put them in a bag for him to take home. I felt like an awesome dad. I still managed to get my work done, dropped the kids off at a movie, made sure they weren't soaking wet and picked them up from the movie. I got all that done before 4 p.m. To me that felt like an achievement.\n\nMy wife got home from work and said she was getting texts from the other mom. Basically, she was asking why her son was wearing our son's clothes and then, after talking to her son, heard the full story. She related that to my wife and I pretty much said \"Yep, that is how it happened\". Her take and the other mom's take was that I was irresponsible. A direct quote from my wife was \"Why did you let them go in the pool?\" I was annoyed at this point...I said I didn't let them do anything, I was working, they jumped in and then I took care of the situation. Somehow that snowballed into I have it so easy working from home and I need to do a better job of watching what our son and his friends do.\n\nAm I the asshole? Things have been tense between us for the past two days and I feel like I should apologize just to make things OK. At the same time, I want her to to apologize to me and say \"Thank you for working full time and watching the kids\".\n\n\\[edited for spacing\\]", "created_utc": 1687267228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14eazoq/aita_for_working_from_home_and_not_watching_my/", "score": 1064, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were the opposite of \"irresponsible\". If anything, you should've asked your son and his friend if it was a smart idea to go to see a movie soaking wet and have them figure out what they should do from that point instead of telling them to change, put their clothes in the dryer, etc.   \n\n\nWhat exactly was \"irresponsible\" from the friend's mom POV?!", "NTA. \n\nYes, it was stupid they jumped in the pool - but it\u2019s what 12 year olds do. He should be old enough to not need a babysitter/be micromanaged. You handled the situation as anyone would have. \n\nYou were home working and there if an emergency happened. You also got them there and home from the movie.", "Work from home here too, why do people think that working from home means we have the day off? I still have scheduled breaks and time I need to be productive, still being managed, still need to actually work \ud83e\udee0 you\u2019re not the asshole at all. I always express to my husband, imagine trying to do xyz while also doing abc, could you manage that? Being home doesn\u2019t mean you have the day off. I\u2019m micromanaged harder being work from home lol", "NTA. 12 years old isn't 4 years old. The boys knew full well jumping in the pool *with their clothes on* was beyond stupid and obnoxious. IMO you would've been entirely justified to refuse to take them to the movie, because really! They knew better, and took advantage of the fact you were working to play up whilst you were completely understandably occupied during your workday.\n\nOf course then you'd have been stuck with 2 wet, sulky 12-year-olds whilst trying to complete your workday.\n\nYou did a favor and got taken advantage of, then got shit for it. NTA, and I'd suggest making it clear WFH acronym leads with the W meaning WORKING.", "NTA - cool. Don\u2019t expect me to provide rides for your kid or have them over at my house while you\u2019re working then. If you want childcare for your kid, organize it and pay for it.", "NTA of course. They are 12, you can't really be expected, or should be expected to follow a couple 12-year-old boys around even *if* you weren't working. \n\nMaybe talk to your wife about making pool rules when kids are over for your son as a way to mitigate the issue.", "NTA. Imo, you handled it well.", "NTA \n\nAt 12 the kids are old enough to not need constant supervision,  especially when you are working. \n\nBut at the same time, no kid should be in the pool without letting an adult know and be supervised. Including your son. Accidents can happen,  especially in a pool.", "NTA. They\u2019re 12, not 5! I can see why friend\u2019s mom would ask about wearing different clothes but I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s it such a big deal. Unless it\u2019s a matter of her son can\u2019t swim or something. Personally, I think she could of at least said thanks for letting my kid hang out all day and for getting them to and from the movies. Not to mention drying his clothes to bring home. I would of if it was my child!", "NTA - My son is 18 and I'm telling you now, boys will be boys. It's not like they asked you for permission to get in the pool before they did it. You stopped them, got them ready for the movie and dried the other kid's clothes. I think you did the right thing and honestly I'm shocked that anyone was upset by this.\n\nI also don't see how you did anything wrong, and all those people who think that because you're working from home means that you have an easy job can get over it. It's still work, regardless as to where it happens. Yes, a little appreciation is in order here.", "NTA you did everything you could. Don\u2019t volunteer to do that again. You did great, you should feel like an awesome dad. You deserve that", "NTA. I wouldn't expect 12 year olds to need constant supervision. I have 2 8 year olds here today and I'm not hovering. \n\nWhat are the rules about going in the pool in general? Are they allowed to without asking or without supervision?", "NTA. The pool could be a bit touchy for some parents, but now you know. \n\nI just also want to point out that this seems a bit one-sided for the moms to think you should be supervising two 12 year old boys nonstop. Where I live it\u2019s common for 12-13 year old girls to be left babysitting even smaller children. If these were girls I doubt they\u2019d think twice.", "Your wife doesn't respect you working from home. Is she always this rigid and judgemental?

They don't need constant supervision. You did fine, and have nothing to apologize for. NTA.", "Mate.. NTA\nI knew the exact layout of my friends wardrobes because of how often we got soaking wet/super dirty while playing as kids, but this was the 90s so probably more chill?\nYou did great. Don't sweat it.", "NTA - I think the problem here starts with \"his friend rode his bike over a few hours before the movie\". I think that you need to be clear with other parents that you working from home does not make your house free childcare for the summer. And if kids are there (including your own), the parental supervision is going to be limited. If other parents (including your wife) want someone to watch the kids full time during the summer, then someone needs to be hired to do that.", "NTA - it's so weird anyone is upset about this incident. They jumped in the pool - theyre kids having fun. Kind of annoying for figuring out the plans, but everything worked out fine, no harm no foul. I do not understand the kind of parent who is actively mad that any of this happened??", "NTA! You dried the clothes. Who GAF?! You did great OP bro!", "NTA. They're TWELVE, not toddlers. Constant surveillance isn't necessary or appropriate.", "I would put my foot down. Tell them that for now on you are to busy for child care. Tell your wife to hire a nanny or deal with it herself. You have a job. It's not your fault that your job is wfh (or it is idk) and wfh dose not mean you can just skirt work responsibilities. NTA", "NTA It's understandable that you're feeling conflicted and unsure about the situation. From your account, it seems like you acted in good faith and made a reasonable effort to accommodate your son and his friend's plans while managing your work responsibilities. However, misunderstandings and differing perspectives can lead to tension in relationships, as seems to be the case here.\r It's important to approach this situation with open communication and empathy. Instead of focusing on assigning blame or demanding an apology, try to initiate a calm and constructive conversation with your wife. Share your perspective, emphasizing that you had work obligations but still did your best to ensure the boys' safety and comfort. Explain your reasoning behind allowing them to use the pool, and express that you didn't anticipate the situation escalating in a way that would impact their movie plans.\r Listen attentively to your wife's concerns and try to understand her perspective as well. Perhaps she was worried about the safety of the boys or felt that there was a lack of supervision. Acknowledge her feelings and concerns, even if you may not fully agree with them. Engage in a dialogue to find common ground and identify any miscommunications or misconceptions that may have contributed to the tension.\r Ultimately, the goal should be to find a resolution that promotes understanding and strengthens your relationship. Apologizing can be a valuable gesture, not necessarily to accept blame for something you genuinely believe wasn't entirely your fault, but rather to acknowledge any unintended consequences or misunderstandings that occurred. An apology can help diffuse tension and demonstrate your willingness to maintain a positive and supportive environment within your family.\r Remember, healthy relationships require ongoing communication, empathy, and compromise. By approaching the situation with understanding and a desire to find a solution, you can work towards resolving the tension and rebuilding harmony within your family.", "NAH\n\nSeems like a good time to talk through all your summer plans and expectations.  \n\nBecause you have a pool, you and your wife need to agree to and write out a safety plan and rules surrounding it\u2019s use.  Pools present an inherent risk.  I raised three sons, all of while were smart and reasonably reliable.  All of the could swim well.  However, there is something about having another boy that age around that makes them more inclined to do dumb, risky things and less inclined to use their common sense than when they are alone.  The level of supervision your son needs around the pool will rise significantly when another kid is in the mix.  While you may trust him to be on the pool deck and even cool off in the water when alone, when a friend is over, you might want to have the gate locked of you can\u2019t directly supervise. I think most parents would expect you to actively supervise kids in the pool.  If you can\u2019t do that, keep it locked.  \n\nIf your wife wants a higher level of supervision in general, you may need to hire a sitter.  It seems dumb to me because most 12 year olds are perfectly safe around the house with a parent home, even if the parent is occupied doing other things.  But you have to talk with her and figure out what she really wants and expects, and be honest about what you are able to provide.  There will be dumb things that happen - falls off a bike, a jump in the pool, a ball through a window.  Those things happen whether you work or not, unless you micromanage the living hell out of a child.  Its not fair for her to rebuke for being negligent when things like that happen.   Your wife needs to understand exactly what you can and can not offer, and if she isn\u2019t satisfied, she needs to be part of creating a solution.", "NTA\n\nSo both mothers think that it is perfectly acceptable for two 12 year olds to go to watch a film in a cinema with lots of unknown people with no supervision but NOT acceptable for someone WORKING at home to take his eyes off said kids while they are in a domestic environment with no stranger danger?  Yes the kids were idiots jumping into the pool but you took a sensible approach to dealing with the situation (which was not one you would have been able to anticipate).  Tell them that you blame the mothers for not instilling common sense in the boys.", "INFO.  Has this friend been over before?   Do you know this kid? If this is a new friend I think paying attention during the first visit, explaining rules, etc is smart.  All that means taking time off work. \n\nBut really they are 12 and should not need constant supervision. And they got to the movies and were fine.  So I lean toward NTA \n\nExcept if this is a kid who you didn\u2019t really know who hadn\u2019t been in your house before I think a little more vigilance is reasonable. Another variable is how assertive your son is and how he would react to any inappropriate behavior.  If your son is timid, or wild himself, being more vigilant during the first visit or two may be smart.   \n\nYou can\u2019t work and do that though.  Take turns taking time off work if this is what is required, because working from home is work. If you do it right you are actually doing work, not micromanaging pre teens.\n\nEdit: autocorrect weirdness", "NTA but I get the impression this mom was trying to gauge the level of supervision at the house and how she needs to address it with her son going forward. I don\u2019t think she handled it well though. For instance our neighbor has a pool. Their kids are ages all around my two kids ages. I wouldn\u2019t be happy if my almost 12 year old came home wet and I found out the adult didn\u2019t know they were in the pool. Not because of supervision issues but because I would like to discuss proper boundaries with my kid like not jumping in a pool just because it\u2019s there, asking the adult first. \n\nI also work from home as do a handful of my kids friends and I don\u2019t expect the level of supervision it seems this mother expected. Maybe that\u2019s just a me vs them thing, but I don\u2019t see anything happening as lack of supervision. However as someone posted above, an open conversation would be helpful for all parties. Perhaps this mom is very worried about water safety. Perhaps she expects a level of supervision greater than you do. All are valid but without an understanding it\u2019s hard to blame anyone for expectations", "Info - They weren't in the pool unsupervised right? You got them out once they jumped in?", "EDIT ESH you technically didn't volunteer to watch them you volunteered to drop them off at the movies. Meaning the other boy shouldn't have been allowed over until closer to the movie. Bad communication between the adults. It's not that the boys went in with their clothes it's that you didn't watch them. As you said you \"didn't allow them in the pool they went in\". 12 is not 6 but accidents can happen very quickly in all cases and pool accidents can lead to drowning. You were working so it makes sense that you could not watch them in the pool. So you should have told them not to go in the pool when the friend got there or said you can't fully supervise because you are working. \n\n\n\nINFO are the other mom and your wife mad that the clothes got wet or that they were unsupervised in the pool? I can understand being worried about 12 year olds alone in the pool. Accidents happen and drowning or injury can happen in seconds.", "[deleted]", "YTA only for the pool part.\n\nEverything else you seem to get an \"awesome dad\" award.\n\nBut the pool was a a glaring oversight.

And I hope you spoke very seriously with your son about him breaking that rule? 12 is still too young to be in the pool, especially roughhousing with a friend, unattended.

Good lord at 12 during the summers our parents kicked us out of the house after breakfast, and told us when dinner was and basically to not bother them till then, and we were running the streets and all managed to survive into adulthood just fine. \n\nHOWEVER, the part for me is the pool thing.  Yeah, kids going in a pool unsupervised is kind of...not okay.  Clothes or not clothes, they should not be in the pool unless there's an adult literally there fast enough to save a kid from drowning.  We knew that if a friend had a pool and we wanted a dip we had to run inside and ask whoever was home if we could and normally it was Mrs Jones and she'd say sure and get herself a glass of lemonade and a novel and sit out by the pool to watch us.  It's just not safe to let little ones in the pool alone.

We occasionally would board dogs in our home. I would work upstairs since I have to talk with people for my job. My husband would be downstairs since he is just reading things on the computer.\n\nWhen we had a guest dog, he was doing most of the work looking after them. The dogs would rarely behave as well as their owners say they do in their own home. So, my husband got frustrated (rightly so) and we stopped boarding dogs in our home.

Setting some firm boundaries is important especially in terms of communication and safety. OP sounds awesome to kids -- and a bit permissive. Friend arrives several hours early, and from the sounds of it, neither kid checked to see if it was okay that friend was there. Even if they did, OP never clearly set any boundaries, like you guys are responsible for watching the time and being ready to leave for the movie. \n\nSecondly, do you guys have common sense pool rules? Running, rough housing, etc near pool, especially without supervision isn't great, and being in the pool without supervision or telling the adults that's the plan isn't great either, especially since OP is responsible for the friend. My guess is these rules *do* exist in OP's family because being responsible for other people's kids is no joke. \n\nInstead of checking the kids boundary pushing, OP enabled it. The consequences for stupid are, you crossed the line, your clothes are wet, and you want to leave in 15 minutes...that doesnt work, no rescue for you, also, since kid and kid's friend can't respect the pool rules, then friend needs to go home. \n\nOP's wife has a real concern-- OP did not set boundaries or enforce the ones in place. The kids were reckless and unsupervised and had no consequences, and made her job harder the next time she has to enforce boundaries. That sad, she crossed a line when she went after OP's job and that he doesn't have it hard, etc. \n\nESH", "My husband works from home.

I\u2019m so sick and tired of people who think that we work from home we have it easy we can do whatever the hell we want including watching children. We are working.", "NTA! They are kids, they had access to a pool and did what kids do, they jumped in! I don\u2019t see the problem here. It\u2019s not your fault they have to go into work everyday and taking it out on you is def not okay! It\u2019s not like you are sitting on your butt twiddling your thumbs all day!! You are working, you just get to work from home. You are being paid to work. Your son is 12 and old enough to know what the boundaries and rules are of the house. It\u2019s not like you weren\u2019t home and they decided to jump in the pool unsupervised. I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t need an adult outside when I went swimming in our pool at that age. I knew I wasn\u2019t allowed in when no one was home. So I don\u2019t understand why their calling you irresponsible. No one was hurt so what is the problem? The friend wearing your kids clothes?? Guess what kids get dirty, wet etc and if the kids are about the same size then you let them borrow clean/dry clothes. That\u2019s common sense at least for me! Good grief!! I don\u2019t think you need to apologize but I do believe your wife and the kids mom owe you an apology. They let their jealousy get the best of them and were rude to you because you work from home.", "NTA. This is a general problem working from home with kids. People are mistaken that you aren\u2019t actually working and can therefore do everything the kids will need during the day. I\u2019d definitely make sure this is a boundary you do not allow anyone to cross moving forward. No good deed goes unpunished.", "People need to understand working from home doesn\u2019t give you a free pass to do whatever the fuck you want. You\u2019re still working, just at home, nothing else is different. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nSometimes being a Dad is a thankless job.  Sounds like you handled everything perfectly.  Give yourself a pat on the back.", "NTA\n\nPeople who work from home (I am one) need boundaries just like people who work in an office.  Would she have expected you to run home from the office to do all of this, too?  If she is so concerned, then she should be in charge of watching the kids while working.  You're right, they were just being 12 year olds.", "NTA. You didn't leave them home alone for 3 nights, you were home and available in case of emergency. What were you expected to do, take the day off and hover over them?\nI think you did great, for whatever it's worth.", " NTA if the mom wants to fuss say she can watch them then. If the friends mom is unhappy with her free childcare then she can keep her own kid at home", "NTA.\n\nAt 12 years old I was home alone for the summer while my mom worked every day.\n\nYour wife is acting like they're 4 and need supervision, in which case you wouldn't be able to work lol.\n\n12 year olds can be alone and there will of course be shenanigans\n\nP.s : I work from home and there is no time for childcare in the day - there might be 1 day in the month where I can breathe a bit more, but nothing regular.", "NTA. These kids sound like they are still allowed to be kids. They get to figure out life for themselves without you being a helicopter.", "NTA. The only thing I would do differently is to take them to the movies in their wet clothes. That'll teach them to not swim in their clothes again.\n\n(I'm just kidding, don't do this. It'll ruin the leather seats in the car.)", "I agree with many of the comments here that you're NTA. Also the points around setting ground rules for the pool are especially valid. Love seeing some good response and advice!\n\nSome of the comments are not as kind towards your wife, so I think not showing her this thread is valid in that respect as the negative may negate the message you're trying to get across. I do agree that many of the points made here, however, need to be expressed to her. \n\nThe kids are plenty old enough to supervise themselves, but there is obviously a need to have a talk about expectations and boundaries they need to abide by while present during times you're working from home. I work from home week on and week off, while my spouse works from home all the time. We have two children, 15 and 6, and each is aware and does their best to ahere to our rules while home during the summer. 15 helps 6 whenever something is needed and we're not available to readily assist due to work. We don't have a pool this year but we did last year, and we made sure they knew our expectations. \n\nAnd yet, kids still do dumb things. While none of ours are pool related, we've had plenty of squabbles between the two or disagreements we've had to intervene in during our work hours. Friends of ours who've had to leave their kids with us when we're working are very aware of the situation and also ensure their kids are prepared and require minimal assistance during that time. \n\nCommunication is key, and possibly marriage counseling.  You need to really express what your capabilites are while working and set firm boundaries for what others should expect from you during that time. I'd hold off on friends coming over for the time being and only reintroduce the idea after your son has shown his ability to respect these boundaries and rules for the summer. \n\nI really liked the suggestion another commentor made about putting the ball back in your wife's court. Talk to her about how you're not able to meet her expectations for watching your child while he's home for the summer and all what her suggestions are for rectifying that. If she pushes back, try to sit her down and have a heart to heart about what your capabilities are and what can be done on both ends to ensure there's no further misunderstanding there. \n\nFinally, I have seen that your son feels really bad about this and feels like he is to blame. At the end of the day, you need to enforce the idea that none of this is his fault. He made a poor choice, yes, but he is not responsible for the response that the friend's mother had to her own child's decision to join in, and he's not responsible for the drama it created with your wife. His consequences should not be related to this matter at all, but sounds instead be based on bettering his ability to recognize and respect boundaries. Your argument is with your wife alone, and there's no good reason why he should feel as if he's the catalyst in that. \n\nDefinitely hope you update us with good news! I hope your wife can come around and see this from your perspective, and also realize how much harm this may be having on your sons mental health. Good luck!", "NTA\nYou were not baby sitting, you were working and took a break to take them to the movies. 12 is typically the age some start babysitting others. I know I was babysitting by the time I turned 12. It is absolutely absurd that this woman thought you were going to watch her 12 year old son when she knows you were working from home", "NTA but you probably should have been more strict about them jumping in the pool without asking first.", "NTA, by 12 I was babysitting the neighbours' children for money.", "NTA   The 2 boys are old enough to know better than jumping in the pool like that.", "Nope. NTA. Sounds like you had things under control. The answer should now be that you can\u2019t watch anyone\u2019s kids when you are working from home. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to have eyes on at all times. They are 12.", "NTA", "NTA. Stop volunteering to watch other people's kids if you are working. There, problem solved. Even WFH is still working. That way you only have to be responsible for your own rambunctious offspring.", "NTA -You were an awesome dad, no doubt. Also sounds like your wife doesn't appreciate the work you do.", "NTA.", "Nta. I work from home and it\u2019s not a free for all and people are explicitly told they are not to be doing childcare at the same time\n\nWfh is not a stay at home parent unless your\nWork hours are completely flexible but most are not. Im expected to be at my desk working during working hours", "YTA for not supervising your son and his friend when they were in the pool! It doesn't take much for an accident to happen. Then you will have a bigger problem the the friend wearing your child's clothing!", "NTA: they are 12 not 2. The kid even road his bike over on his own. If he\u2019s old enough to travel to a friends house without a parent, he can play in the backyard without being watched like a hawk. Plus 12 year olds do dumb stuff like this all the time. No harm, no foul.", "NTA", "> I looked out to see they're both jumping in the pool in their clothes. \n\nAnd then did - nothing about the behavior except he gave him clothes for the movie.\n\nThat IS irresponsible.\n\nBut in a general \u201cI never set and enforced any sensible pool rules for my own kid (no swimming without an adult, no swimming in street clothes, no jumping into a likely shallow pool, no friends in pool without their parental permission), and now it\u2019s biting me on the ass\u201d kind of way.", "I have seen someone panic and nearly drown himself  and the person trying to assist him in a couple inches of water. It's absolutely irresponsible to have two pre-teens horse playing in and around the pool without someone keeping an eye on them.\n\nThe OP and his family absolutely need to have a talk about pool safety before someone gets hurt.", "I have seen someone panic and nearly drown himself  and the person trying to assist him in a couple inches of water.

If the OP is too busy working to keep an eye out while they swim, they shouldn't be in the pool.", "Thank you. That is really kind and supportive. It's advice I'll try to follow.", "Why is this so terrible?", "100% this. I first started working from home permanently in 2013, and I very quickly learned I had to set boundaries\u2014luckily my wife wasn\u2019t a worthless dumbfuck and she immediately understood and complied. But at first she and our temporary houseguest were acting like I was just hanging out, and that just wasn\u2019t true.\n\nI don\u2019t know the right way for OP to say it but simply stating \u201cI\u2019m working\u201d seems sufficient to me.", "I don't think so. Maybe people get ideas together real quickly. My son's functional but he's definitely not a baby or an adult. I doubt other children develop differenetly.", "My mind also immediately went to pool safety. I think the other mom has a responsibility to clarify with OP what precautions there are around the pool though, or to says he doesn't want him swimming unsupervised. I am surprised at how casual OP is about the kids swimming by themselves.", "I really don't think the kind of mother who is this overprotective of a 12 year old is just going to suddenly let go when the kid turns 16.", "Thats a fair point to make. I feel like I was present enough to make sure they didn't drown and everything did end safely.", "> I don't want to die on a hill of how work is defined\n\nIts comparing apples and oranges. Work is work, you're paid for your skill set. Unless your wife and friends mom work in the same field as you, they literally cannot do your job regardless how -easy- you make it look.\n\nYour wife needs to understand that she is essentially asking you to be okay a potential with loss of income because you were fired for watching two children when you should have been working.\n\nYou were pretty damn responsible through this. NTA.", "I get that. Depending on how well this mom knows you she may or may not trust your judgement though.\n\nI know when I was a kid there were some parents that my folks would have completely trusted and believed that, some where they would have needed to get to know them better to trust it and some where they absolutely would not have believed them. \n\nI obviously don't know you so I'll take you at your word that you were present enough, but it might be worth having a conversation with the mom to make her feel more assured."]}
