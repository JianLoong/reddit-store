His disability is incidental to why you\u2019re cutting him off.\n\nYou\u2019re cutting him off because he became verbally/emotionally abusive.  You don\u2019t owe an abuser anything - not your time, presence, support, money, or love.  Being abusive cuts away all of that (though a court of law may disagree about $ if there is a legal debt between you, I\u2019m speaking morally here).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like he has any real interest in making amends.  There would be a serious apology, one that involves taking responsibility for his choices and his actions, if he was trying to make amends.  Instead, he seems to be using his circumstances to excuse or even justify how he behaved.  You don\u2019t have to make time and space for that.  Even if it was actually an apology and an attempt to make amends, you wouldn\u2019t have to accept it.  Accepting an apology is a choice; it\u2019s optional.

It\u2019s very sad that this is happening to him, but being sick or disabled is no excuse to be mean or rude.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019s having a tough time adjusting to his new reality, he will either grow bitter or he\u2019ll adjust.    I would tell him all this and that there will be no more conversation or assistance until he can treat you with respect, then cut him off and give him a lot of time before you think about talking again.

Stick to your guns.", "NTA\u2014 while I pity him for losing his sight, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to tolerate being called names and blamed for nonsense.

I couldn't get into some stuff due to limit of the post, but one of the reasons I was blamed for was that I help him cover the costs of some tests so he wouldn't have to wait until the public hospital could do them (MRI, blood tests, that kind of things) and speed up his treatment... everything ended up indicating to be most likely MS, and the treatment they did on the hospital did work on him, but... he didn't want to follow up on it", "His family is even against any surgery or long needles. They say and I quote \"perforation beyond the skin, will damage your body forever because the energy flow of your being is disrupted beyond repair\". They only allow treatment outside the skin, nothing goes in your body basically and I was WTF??? And they still do as far as I know.", "Thank you. I'm battling the part that I do know what it means to be all by your own. And I empathize, but at some point I think I became his punching bag for his frustration or something. I dunno. He insists, but after so many years I still think I deserve a \"hey I'm sorry I put this on you and for all the awful things I said to you\"... or at least, start there, but he never does.", "And you're right about not liking him anymore. I did like him and cared for him for months, because I cared about him. But when on a daily basis when we got in touch after he left, he continually blamed me and said things such as \"well, good thing I can't see anymore, that way I can manage that you're ugly AF\", I definitely started to care less and like him less.", "I can see why you might interpret that. I couldn't go into much more detail due to limitation. And I see why you get that impression. When the treatment on the hospital worked and the tests he did get while his stay it started to indicate autoimmune (MS probably). When he was discharged he had regained 90% of his eyesight and he was advised to follow up on the possibility of MS, because it could be manageable, and most importantly, he could avoid any further damage to his optic nerve if he continue his treatment, but he refused to take the pills prescribed. That's why I refer to the fact that he had a choice and an effective treatment literally in his hand to avoid inflammation but he decided against it due to his anti-science posture.", "It\u2019s still not really the illness (and resulting disability) that\u2019s the problem - it\u2019s the way he treats you.  It sounds like you did everything you reasonably could for him, and your thoughtfulness and generosity were not appreciated.\n\nI understand pretty well what your ex is experiencing.  I\u2019m severely disabled.  I met my now-husband 7 months after I got sick (well, 6 if you include the month or so we spent messaging online before meeting in person).  I\u2019d just gone through a big battery of tests that eliminated a bunch of possibilities, and had no answers for what was going on.  My research and the advice of a lot of disabled people I\u2019d met on a chronic illness forum pointed me at a possible answer, but it also suggested I needed to see a top expert in that condition, because if I had it, I had a subtle case of it.  My insurance wouldn\u2019t cover that, so after less than a year of dating, my now-husband paid for the visit, because I didn\u2019t have the money.  I recognized that was special and appreciated it.  He does what he can to make my life easier and better.  I\u2018m not perfect, and I do have grumpy snarly days, but I appreciate him and the things he does to help me.  I treat him with the kindness and consideration you give a partner.  I try not to take him for granted.  I apologize for the times when feeling lousy gets the better of me and I\u2019m short or snippy with him.  I try very hard to mind the difference between explaining my behavior and excusing it.\n\nIf he is alone now, that is a thing of his own making; he wouldn\u2019t be alone if he\u2019d treated you decently.  And from the way he\u2019s talking - excusing his bad behavior, not apologizing or making amends - it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s likely to change.  If he was going to change, it would start with taking responsibility for the hurt he caused you.  If he\u2019s not taking responsibility for that, you have no reason to think he\u2019ll change his behavior significantly going forward.  It sounds like he expects his past bad behavior towards you to just be swept under the rug, and people who expect that usually expect that future bad behavior will be treated the same way.", "Well that's weird and culty and it sucks that he's basically trading his eyesight for acceptance from cult members I hope they're prepared to support him in his disability that they helped cause", "That still doesn\u2019t mean he is \u201cdisabled by his own making.\u201d But, leave him alone. You don\u2019t like him & think he\u2019s an idiot who deserves this.", "Thank you very much for all your comments. I'm glad I'm able to read your perspective from this. I deeply appreciate you taking the time in your response. Because you worded very perfectly for me with this: \"the difference between explaining my behavior and excusing it.\". Thank you for your input cause now I have a perfect way to describe this part of the situation", "Thank you for your comments and thoughts. I will for sure take into consideration your input as part of my process to deal with the situation. I genuinely wanted to bounce off some \"external actors\" as to what your take is on this because I feel it's time to get opinions and comments from the outside. Thanks!", "NTA. You can't reason with them. These are people who let him go blind just to protect their belief system and he follows right along. They will easily make you the bad guy to blame for everything. Block, avoid.", "NTA block him and change emails if you must. Let him keep refusing and taking his family's advice and worsen his condition.", "I had an X who would stop taking his schizophrenia medications every 2 years because the textbooks say you need to be on them that long before trying to see if you still need them. He has several Bachelor degrees and lives in a group home unable to care for himself. His mother wants me to visit him. That's a big no for me. There were other red flags but that I don't forgive him for. You owe this guy nothing. It's just like the heart patient who won't get treated or the diabetic who won't control thier sugars.", "Ah shit, MS is nasty and if he doesn\u2019t take the right medicine he is going to lose all function.\n\nSomeone in my family has it and it isn\u2019t pretty. You don\u2019t deserve to be blamed nor os it your responsibility to be with someone who insults you. Walk away and lose and block his number", "It\u2019s a really, really important line.  I grew up with my dad incapable of telling the difference, so it\u2019s one I try very hard to keep my eye on, because I don\u2019t want to do to other people what he did to me.  Lots of \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you, but I wouldn\u2019t have yelled if you didn\u2019t XYZ.\u201d  Which is different from \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled.  I got stressed and I took it out on you, and that was wrong of me.\u201d  One blames something external for the way you behaved, the other recognizes that you control (or fail to control)  your behavior and are responsible for yourself.  In psychology terms, it\u2019s called an external locus of control vs an internal locus of control.  Someone who views their behavior as having an external locus often can\u2019t/won\u2019t change - they\u2019ll keep responding the same way because they believe the thing that causes their behavior is outside factors that force their behavior from them.  Someone who views their behavior as having an internal locus is much more likely to change, simply because they believe they can; they see their behavior as something they control and change.\n\nNow, no matter how good the apology is, an apology that keeps repeating itself without change is worthless.  I\u2019ve had to learn that sometimes when I\u2019m feeling particularly crappy, I need to go be alone for a bit.  That way, I don\u2019t bite people\u2019s heads off over minor things.  Being able to identify your triggers and tell people \u201cI need some space, I\u2019m not feeling good and I\u2019m in A Mood\u201d is a skill.  If you deal with a condition that is painful, scary, frustrating, or all 3, it can be a really important skill to acquire, for the sake of the people around you, especially the ones you care about.  My husband has had to learn that when I go lay down because I don\u2019t feel well, he shouldn\u2019t try to check in and be helpful, he should let me be until I\u2019m back to being my usual self.  It\u2019s harder when I hit that state of unwellness when we\u2019re out of the house, but we\u2019ve learned to communicate better around that, over the years."]}
