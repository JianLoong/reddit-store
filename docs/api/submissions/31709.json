Time spent mouching off of you she should spend working to improve her own situation.", "NTA but you need to say it and clearly. You can not come over EVERY weekend for 3 days. The truth is sometimes when a person is not at the same level or direction as you drift apart. It\u2019s not always the case particularly when that person is still working to improve themselves is unclear what your friend is doing with her life but you really have to make sure you\u2019re not enabling her.", "I would have allowed her to use the car for her driving test. She would be supervised during the test by the examiner. I would drive her there, stay, and drive my car home. This event wastes your time and is annoying but I would help her become more independent so she stops asking you to give her rides.", "NTA for the question asked. But do you really consider her your friend? One of the things you list as *her* *personal* flaws is something her mother and aunt did when she was 13. If a kid is upset when she's excluded from friends activity because of something her shitty adults did, it doesn't mean the kid \"wants others to bend backwards\" for her.\n\nMost other things are nothings, also. Like, nothing wrong with asking \"will you grab X for me/drive me\", as long as she accepts your \"no\" without further nagging. Basically, all she is is being human and looking for easy solutions for everything, and you dislike it. You doesn't seem to be friends and you seem incompatible in general. \n\nBut you also is not in a position to give her temporary shelter from her shitty family. Having another adult regularly share a room AND bed with you without being absolutely forced to (like in a dorm) gets old fast. You WNBTA if you refuse to do it, but all the \"reasons\" you listed have nothing to do with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If this was 10 years ago, she was 13 at the time. And if she\u2019s had issues with her family, then she probably wasn\u2019t in a position to be able to deny them. I guess I\u2019m a little confused why the child in that situation was punished instead of your mom taking it up with the other adults?\n\nI\u2019m also confused in Point 3. Why\u2019d she need to go to another city for her driver\u2019s test? This does show she was willing to try to gain the independence and means to drive herself around so you won\u2019t be her chauffeur anymore, though. Has she made other attempts to pass her driving tests?", "NTA.  She\u2019s taking gross advantage and is acting like an entitled brat.  \n\nShe says people aren\u2019t there for her like she is for them?  What a joke.\n\nTake, take, take.\n\nWonder if the fighting at home is because of her entitlement and bad manners given how she is with you.", "She's doesn't see you as a friend but as someone to take advantage of.", "NTA. She doesn't sound like much of a friend. Learn to say no. If she can't accept boundaries, write this one sided friendship off.", "NTA. You need your space and your rest. Go LC with this person immediately.", "She is a user. You need to set boundaries with her and uphold them. I\u2019m not sure this is a friendship worth fighting for. It\u2019s fine to tell her staying with you on the weekends is no longer an option.", "Exactly well said, friends don\u2019t take advantage of you. They ask for help in a time of need but it\u2019s good to put a structure/timeline/boundary on that", "I do feel that she is a enormous user of you and your family. I would help her with the test but not let her drive your car afterward. Moving on from this day, I'd find ways to distance myself from her and hang out with more like-minded people.", "Thanks for your feedback! That is fair. It was really far but I also wasn\u2019t sure if my car was eligible because it had a couple things going on with it at the time. I did let her use my car to go driving with her so she could practice.", "Thanks for your feedback. The list is not meant to come across as personal flaws more so instances that contribute to my feeling fed up currently. The cottage situation was not her fault, however to feel owed the invite on every subsequent trip is questionable. It\u2019s okay to feel upset or disappointed which we discussed at the time that it happened. But it\u2019s unfair to bring it up 10 years later as leverage in an argument, when we were both children in a situation where the adults had an issue.", "As for point 7, you\u2019re right we were 13. With that said, I had to go with what my mom decided. Also, it was myself, my god sister, her mom and my mom (4/6 ppl), the invitation was extended to this friend out of good will and to be inclusive because she knew them as well. Once the experience went sour my mom just wanted to take a step back all together. With the master bedroom situation she did address it and it was resolved. But for everything else I think she was walking on egg shells because she didn\u2019t want to make things awkward for me.  \n\nPoint 3, she failed the test a few times. After the last fail, she wanted to retest asap and the closest available date was in a city far away. I said  \u201cI couldn\u2019t\u201d to be brief w the word count but what i meant was. My car had a service light on the dash and the front signal light was wonky. I didn\u2019t want to risk it in case it was ineligible to use for testing because i know the testers check. But i did go out driving with her and let her use my car to practice for a few days.  \n\nThanks for ur feedback!", "Also if she passed the test how long would it be when the car becomes our car and op isn't allowed to use it unless shes paying for gas and insurance.
