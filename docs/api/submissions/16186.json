{"id": 16186, "submission_id": "13571nt", "title": "AITA for telling my mother I used to sleep on bathroom floors?", "selftext": "My parents and I were arguing about the Canadian school system. We are first gen immigrants, meaning that they got to experience the good old European 'you're getting smacked with a ruler' education system, meanwhile I didn't. They are very much for it, and believe the current system is too lenient on asshole students. I was in European school for only 3 years, but those 3 years are very much engraved into my brain as some of the worst memories of my life. Aside from the total lack of disregard from my teachers, the constant bullying from my peers, and the academic pressure that made me cry regularly, I had to deal with being insulted and groped nearly daily. None of my teachers ever did anything. I was known as the stupid kid in school.\n\nCut forward to tonight. I'm a senior in highschool, I'm at the top of my class, I've gotten into my first choice university, and I've got a working knowledge of philosophy, history, literature, psychology etc.\n\nTo me this is proof that the system works. This was after some of the worst years of my life, with homelessness being a very real issue, spending my time in an incredibly homophobic and transphobic household, having Child Services visit my home every week, and dealing with unmedicated unipolar depression for five years straight. It was bad.\n\nAround this time last year, I used to call out of class and fall asleep in the school bathroom. Every day, I'd find my way out of class and fall asleep in there, on the floor, for 10-20 minutes. Other times I'd just walk around or fall asleep in stairwells, against walls, wherever. I was exhausted.\n\nThat's not the case anymore.\n\nI used this fact in my argument for why the Canadian school system worked. Because I didn't have teachers who screamed at me, and because I wasn't treated like an animal despite the fact I looked and acted like one, I am able to drag myself to school today. I dressed in ripped clothes, and was half sentient half the time people talked to me. My hair was a mess. I looked like I'd just stumbled out of a back alley. I was rarely in class, and when I was, I turned assignments in weeks late.\n\nThe instant I shared this information with my mother, she shut down. She left the room instantly, and then later came back demanding to know why no one had told her, if I was lying, why I hadn't told her. She is now in her room feeling like crap. She is very much the reason as to why my life has been hell for the past few years.\n\nShe has been trying to be a more active part in my life, trying to comfort me when I'm upset and making strides in helping me with my mental health. But it seems that when being confronted with the fact that I was doing bad last year, her own mental health takes a dive.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- I was exhausted last year because of personal stuff, and I used to fall asleep in bathrooms. When I told my mother, she shut down instantly and left. She's been trying her best to be supportive, but I think I really upset her by opening up.", "created_utc": 1682989609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13571nt/aita_for_telling_my_mother_i_used_to_sleep_on/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm glad you lived through it, defied it, and are here to talk about it today.\n\nThe good news is, your mother is an adult. She's had years of practice feeling her feelings. *It's not your job to manage her feelings* \\-- you're a kid, and it's your job to survive and grow. Sounds like you are doing it.\n\nNTA for blurting out the truth, but brace yourself for a guilt trip or massive denial and \"that didn't happen\" OP", "NTA. She's the one who was so checked out of your life that you couldn't even tell her about being a stealth crapper napper, much less the rest of your problems. You are succeeding in spite of her lack of effort. It's not your fault she doesn't have a clue how to parent.", "NTA. if you had child services coming to see you every week, it should've been clear to her that you weren't okay. Instead, she ignored all the signs.\n\nNot only are you NTA, but she is a HUGE AH. Putting you through so much shit and then acting like this when she finds out how it made you feel is really cruel. She's turning the bad experience you went through into a pity party for herself, and that is horrible. I'm sorry OP, but I'm glad you're doing better this year.", "NTA. Also, congrats on getting through high school and into university! \n\nI had a very similar (but less extreme) experience with my mom. I was also very depressed throughout high school and in hindsight was in *desperate* need of therapy. My parents mostly let me do my own thing because I was seen as \"the good kid\". They had their hands full with my little brother who acted out and had a lot of issues that just really couldn't be hidden or ignored. It feels hyerbolic to say that they neglected me, but sometimes it felt that way. \n\nIn college, things spiraled quite badly my freshman year and I ended up on antidepressants. When I came home for spring break, I tried to open up with my mom about it and she made it all about herself - her first response was \"Was I such a bad mother?? Why are both my children on antidepressants? Where did I go wrong?\" and started crying, then completely shut down. It been 18 years since that conversation and I really never talked with her much about my mental health after that.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks that your mum hears something bad that you experienced and focuses on her reaction rather than on you and your well being. Your mum should put you first, especially when talking about your experiences.", "NTA. I\u2019m very glad to hear that your mother is trying to be better. My own mother actively harmed me with her parenting and lack of knowledge about my mental health issues. Now that she\u2019s trying too, we have developed a very close relationship. It hurts her deeply to hear about the impact she had on me back then. But it\u2019s not my fault\u2014and it\u2019s not yours. That is her burden to work through. It\u2019s ok to feel empathy and love for your parent even when they\u2019ve wronged you. But it\u2019s not ok to take the weight of that wrong on your own shoulders.\n\nI wish you the best as you continue to grow and succeed. And I hope you can work with your mom to develop a new relationship built on love and recovery from the past \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA. Your mum is the AH.\nYou\u2019ve been through hell. She deserves to know that. I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019ve been through but well done on what you\u2019re achieving now. I wish you all the best & success with your life. If you choose to have kids in the future you know not to be like your mum."]}
