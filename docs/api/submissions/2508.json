{"id": 2508, "submission_id": "yx7imj", "title": "WIBTA for ruining my mom\u2019s 50th birthday party?", "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all. This is a bit of a ride, so please bear with me. For background: my (23F) family is not from the US, but they moved back to our home country a year after I started college. At the time, my sisters \u201cAmy\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d (not their real names) were still in school. Amy is now 18 and started college this semester, Mary is 14 and a freshman in high school.\n\nBecause we\u2019re not from the US, my mom had no idea what raising a teenager here is like AND she never really tried. I had next to no independence, wasn\u2019t allowed to have a job, didn\u2019t learn to drive until I was eighteen, etc. My social life was severely limited by this, but I was holding out hope for university. When it was time to apply for college, they kindly let me know that we were moving back to our home country and that I was expected to go with them. I applied to colleges behind their backs, but I had to do everything by myself and I mean EVERYTHING. In other words, they made it really hard for me to leave them. They eventually allowed me to move out. My dad provides some financial support, but I work full-time on top of a full course load at university and can barely afford to feed myself. Asking them for help is like pulling teeth; they promised me a year ago that they\u2019d help me buy a used car, but keep putting it off. Last I heard, my parents weren\u2019t sure they could afford it, yet they just went on a trip to Switzerland and are finalizing paperwork for a huge property on a tropical beach. By comparison, they help my sister Amy with everything. For instance, she did competitive gymnastics for a long time. It was super expensive, so there wasn\u2019t enough money for Mary and I to have our choice of extracurriculars. She didn\u2019t learn how to do laundry until she was fifteen, she has been allowed full use of the family car since she was seventeen, and when she was looking at colleges my parents did everything in their power to help her get in. Yesterday, I found out that they are paying for Amy to move into a one-bedroom apartment, furnish it, and (this was my last straw) have a maid come to clean it once a week.\n\nI am absolutely furious and I know from past experience that confronting them never works. So here is where I might be an asshole: My mom is turning fifty in a few weeks and is making a huge deal out of it. They rented an event space, hired caterers, and invited 200 people to celebrate. I am expected to make an appearance, but I have to take off work and school to be there, which will cost me about a week of wages. I know that part of the reason Mom wants me there is because she booked a photographer and she wants the whole family to be in the pictures. But I have spent years trying to develop a healthy parent-child relationship, and I don\u2019t know what else will get through to them.

It\u2019s really hard to say no to my family. My dad is traveling to pick me up and bring me home for the party\u2014 it\u2019s a 16 hour drive. I would tell them I\u2019m not coming before he makes the drive, but they\u2019ve already put a lot of money into this party\u2014 and me.

Lol", "Amy is studying in our home country! Mary is still in HS and isn\u2019t thinking about college yet, which worries me (esp if she decides on the US). The cost of living there is significantly less, which would make up for the disparity between us except for the fact that they are doing everything for her (finding the apartment, enrolling her in college, paying for entrance fees) whereas I did everything myself. Maybe if they had learned from their mistakes and treated all of us better I\u2019d be less hurt, but they treat Mary like they treat me. IE, emotionally neglectful.", "Really? The laundry list above was not enough direct cause for you to go LC before?", "Every conflict with them happens over a period of weeks or months. We\u2019ll be okay, and then over time some new problem will become evident to me and I realize all over again that they\u2019re like that. I think it\u2019s bc I haven\u2019t lived at home in over two years."]}
