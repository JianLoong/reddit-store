For background: my (23F) family is not from the US, but they moved back to our home country a year after I started college. At the time, my sisters \u201cAmy\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d (not their real names) were still in school. Amy is now 18 and started college this semester, Mary is 14 and a freshman in high school.\n\nBecause we\u2019re not from the US, my mom had no idea what raising a teenager here is like AND she never really tried. I had next to no independence, wasn\u2019t allowed to have a job, didn\u2019t learn to drive until I was eighteen, etc. My social life was severely limited by this, but I was holding out hope for university. When it was time to apply for college, they kindly let me know that we were moving back to our home country and that I was expected to go with them. I applied to colleges behind their backs, but I had to do everything by myself and I mean EVERYTHING. In other words, they made it really hard for me to leave them. They eventually allowed me to move out. My dad provides some financial support, but I work full-time on top of a full course load at university and can barely afford to feed myself. Asking them for help is like pulling teeth; they promised me a year ago that they\u2019d help me buy a used car, but keep putting it off. Last I heard, my parents weren\u2019t sure they could afford it, yet they just went on a trip to Switzerland and are finalizing paperwork for a huge property on a tropical beach. By comparison, they help my sister Amy with everything. For instance, she did competitive gymnastics for a long time. It was super expensive, so there wasn\u2019t enough money for Mary and I to have our choice of extracurriculars. She didn\u2019t learn how to do laundry until she was fifteen, she has been allowed full use of the family car since she was seventeen, and when she was looking at colleges my parents did everything in their power to help her get in. Yesterday, I found out that they are paying for Amy to move into a one-bedroom apartment, furnish it, and (this was my last straw) have a maid come to clean it once a week.\n\nI am absolutely furious and I know from past experience that confronting them never works. So here is where I might be an asshole: My mom is turning fifty in a few weeks and is making a huge deal out of it. They rented an event space, hired caterers, and invited 200 people to celebrate. I am expected to make an appearance, but I have to take off work and school to be there, which will cost me about a week of wages. I know that part of the reason Mom wants me there is because she booked a photographer and she wants the whole family to be in the pictures. But I have spent years trying to develop a healthy parent-child relationship, and I don\u2019t know what else will get through to them.

It\u2019s really hard to say no to my family. My dad is traveling to pick me up and bring me home for the party\u2014 it\u2019s a 16 hour drive. I would tell them I\u2019m not coming before he makes the drive, but they\u2019ve already put a lot of money into this party\u2014 and me. Dad provides some financial support, mainly in the way of rent. He pays half, which makes my rent ALMSOT reasonable (big city). Pulling this stunt might affect the financial support. Does that help?", "It\u2019s not no support, there\u2019s a little bit of support. Dad covers about a quarter of my costs, but I\u2019m burning myself out working so hard and still being stretched thin enough to rely on his contribution. \n\nHonestly the thought of sabotaging the party hadn\u2019t occurred to me, but now I want to consider it! Lol", "Amy is studying in our home country! Mary is still in HS and isn\u2019t thinking about college yet, which worries me (esp if she decides on the US). The cost of living there is significantly less, which would make up for the disparity between us except for the fact that they are doing everything for her (finding the apartment, enrolling her in college, paying for entrance fees) whereas I did everything myself. Maybe if they had learned from their mistakes and treated all of us better I\u2019d be less hurt, but they treat Mary like they treat me. IE, emotionally neglectful.", "Really? The laundry list above was not enough direct cause for you to go LC before?", "Every conflict with them happens over a period of weeks or months. We\u2019ll be okay, and then over time some new problem will become evident to me and I realize all over again that they\u2019re like that. I think it\u2019s bc I haven\u2019t lived at home in over two years.", "NTA.  Rewrite the list of all the support they give your sisters and your parents trips and property buys, and put it on your fridge or bathroom mirror.  When you remind yourself of how you have been treated, you will feel stronger about LC.  They count on you forgetting.  What AHs.", "NTA, and I\u2019m just so sorry \ud83d\ude14. I\u2019m an only child, so I have no direct experience with this, but I\u2019ve always believed that one of the most important jobs of parents is to never let their kids feel like they have a favorite child (even though I\u2019m sure they often do). Your parents are failing so miserably at this, and it\u2019s truly terrible. Don\u2019t go,treat yourself to something that makes you feel special and valuable, and then  feel your feelings about all of it; they\u2019ve got to be painful and complicated.", "Nta, you say conflict  arises from time to time. Start a journal and you will see a pattern of a cycle they spin in. It will show how predictable  they are.  As for the party. You don't owe anything to them. Your entitled  to own your feelings about what has transpired.  And you have the right to keep your life drama free as much as you can. Take care of yourself and move on with your life. Go low contact  and build your happiness.  You deserve it. They do not deserve you.", "Mum doesn't owe her either! Yes, the favoritism for Amy is blatant and bullshit, but so is the entitlement of OP.  My vote is ESH.", "My friends and I used to do this with crappy boyfriends! I guess in a way it still works\u2014 breaking up with your parents lol.", "It's not entitlement to expect being treated the same as a sibling. Especially if you've never done anything to warrant being treated as less than. OP isn't some drug-addicted delinquent who has caused their parents grief. They're a kid trying to get ahead in life by supporting themself and their education. Their parents are clearly not broke either. Why is it wrong to want the same things that their sister is getting?", "Based on your comments I'm saying softly YTA.  You live in places with vastly different COL.  Your parents subsidize half your rent while supporting your sister with an apartment and a housekeeping. If the monetary contribution for your sister is much higher I feel like you would have outright said so. Is it a matter of the money goes further where your sister is going to school?  Your parents may have been more invested in your sisters decisions because she is making more financially sound choices.", "That\u2019s fair! And COL is a huge factor\u2014 I can\u2019t be sure that they\u2019re spending THAT much more on my sister, but based on conversations with my dad back in the day, he would\u2019ve paid for a boarding room (basically just a bed space/maybe a solo room in a shared house) for me if I\u2019d stayed in our home country for college.", "OHAI Amy!", "It\u2019s sometimes easier to slowly over time go light LC to very LC if not no contact and it\u2019s even easier to do that when there\u2019s no obvious catalyst.  It also gives them a chance to try to work on themselves if they bother to notice the slow ghost.", "This sounds cathartic if you don\u2019t care for the fallout.", "This is really good advice, thank you!", "You don\u2019t need to go from 100 to 0 instantly. You can just distance yourself slowly and make excuses. Sounds like you already have a ready made excuse with full time work on top of full time coursework. You can then contact them as frequently as you like. Start with saying you can\u2019t financially afford to get to the birthday now and go from there. If you make it a big deal it will somehow be your fault again.", "True, there is the risk of that. A lot of conflict in our family seems to be \u201cmy\u201d fault already, so I don\u2019t want to make it worse. Thank you!", "INFO: Are they funding your sibling\u2019s lifestyle in a country other than the US with a much lower cost of living and different economic standards? For example, having a maid or regular housecleaner is something that is relatively affordable by middle class families in my parent\u2019s home country, but inconceivable for us in the USA. Similarly, would they have supported your college plans if you had gone back to their home country when they moved, and is your sibling being assisted there? If you moved to their home country, would they support you with housing, transportation, etc? \n\nIf the currency of their home country is a much smaller one than the US dollar, I can see how they may have been unwilling to support your choice to live in a country they can\u2019t afford. I also know that event space and party costs in my parents\u2019 country would be significantly lower than what similar events would cost here, and once you add in the exchange rate, what seems extravagant is really not so, I\u2019m comparison to just daily life where I live. I can see how frustrating it must be to have parents begrudging of their support, but I personally would not expect my parents to fund my life choices to live on my own in a place with much higher cost of living. The trip to Switzerland and beach property make it seem like they are rolling in it, but again, if it were in the context of a situation like my parents\u2019, I wouldn\u2019t expect them to forgo luxuries that they could afford in order to subsidize my adult life choices.\n\nMy younger sibling lives in my family\u2019s home\u2014while my parents moved into a condo they recently purchased\u2014hasn\u2019t had a job in a long time, was given an old family car, and gets an allowance from my grandparent. I on the other hand have basically been supporting myself since I was in college\u2014which I wanted to pursue in a country that my parents couldn\u2019t afford to fund. I made it through college and grad school by working all the time and eating microwaved potatoes and sandwiches with two slices of the cheapest turkey lunch meat, besides my five meal a week required meal plan at the dining hall. But I wanted to go to school and live here, when I could have been supported by my family had I stayed at home. So N T A for not wanting to attend the party, but some additional context might paint your parents less AH-ey than your post paints them.", "NTA\n\nSend her a card and wish her well. Nothing more. Of she really valued your presence she'd be doing everything she could to make it possible for you to attend.", "Good plan. Dump the reason for not showing on them - cannot afford it and/or need the car to get there (drive, or get to airport?) if I could afford the gas, can\u2019t afford the lost pay of a week off work \u2026.."]}
