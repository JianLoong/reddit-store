The fact that they feel entitled to it and had the audacity to make the comments that they did is completely ridiculous.

Self service I\u2019m not tipping. Starbucks has a tipping system now. I rarely go and went the other day and was confused.", "NTA this whole tipping culture in america just seems so absolutely bizarre to me! i cant say much about it since i don\u2019t know what the whole tipping situation there is like but honestly workers aren\u2019t entitled to tips and should instead rage for a higher wage (unintentional rhyme hehe) if this were perhaps at a restaurant and you ordered an actual meal then yeah i guess this would have been different? but a $10 tip still seems generous to me especially for the few little things you ordered!!", ">server tells me \u201cit\u2019s ok i just don\u2019t want customers who don\u2019t tip.\u201d\n\nShe better own that place.

Long time bartender here, you don't whine about that stuff, you just move on to the next customer, usually you'll get a bigger tip to balance out the night.

I would inform the manager that I will never visit this establishment again, and tell him why in detail.\n\nIt's OK to leave a tip or not leave a tip.  Staff getting pushy about tips?  Not cool...

But tipping is obscene at this point. I got asked to tip at the do it yourself dog bath place a few weeks ago. I\u2019m sorry, what?! You want me to tip you for allowing me to wash my own dog after I paid the service fee?! Tips should be dependent on the level of service and for exception service. Just fucking charge me enough to pay your employees.", "NTA There are a lot of entitled idiots out there and they seem to be multiplying.", "NTA. You are not obligated to tip at all.

It was perfectly reasonable of you to assume that the cash tip you left in the jar was sufficient. You were not obligated to leave a second tip for the beer and the server was out of line in expecting one.

I definitely had a small panic moment at the end thinking if the person I had eaten with had seen me tip upfront so they wouldn't think I'm a non tipper/if the waitress also knew I tipped upfront as well.", "NTA where I live you only tip if the service And food was exceptionally good or if you were making some extra or a bit fiddler asks.\n\nYou do Not tip for them just doing their work and the food being standard for the establishment.\n\nHere if you get a tip you know you\u2019ve Earned it for being Good at your job not just for showing up.

It shouldn\u2019t be tippers paying someone\u2019s salary it should be the business hiring them. A tip should be extra and not demanded.", "NTA tipping is for good table service not for getting your beer at the bar what did they door besides open it and hand it to you. Tipping should never be expected. Honestly some of these wait staff end up making more than some professionals in my state because of tips.", "NTA. Cash tips are not taxed. Tipping in the US is a big deal because we do not have a living wage. No one in the US can work full time on minimum wage. And no, teenagers are not the only people paid minimum wage. The US has been thrown back to the gilded age.", "Like I was in bar in New York, I have to go to bar, order drinks and carry them to table myself and then I have to leave 20% tip? US is wierd.\nNTA I guess", ">I don\u2019t tip on self serve\n\nSame, absolutely wild.", "Well I can\u2019t speak for every self service restaurant, but at Starbucks at least, tips are split between everyone, not just whoever\u2019s working register. So you\u2019re not just tipping the guy who rang in your order, you\u2019re tipping the guy who made your drink, who made your food, the guy who cleaned your chair and table, etc", "Honestly a $10 tip on two beers, a hot dog and a pretzel is probably close to a 50% tip. Standard at the bar is $1 per beer/wine/shot and $2 if it's a mixed drink that actually takes effort to make. Food can get complicated, but if you had to go to the bar to get it and take it back to your table yourself there shouldn't be a tip cuz they're getting it handed to them by the cook then putting it on the bar with your number. IE part of the job they should already be paid fairly for. \n\nThe problem is, they make more being tipped than they would getting \"fair pay\" so waitstaff/bartenders will never fight for better wages cuz even $15/hr with no tips would be a pay cut for them over $2.13/hr+tips.", "A lot of servers would never want to replace tips with wages. Then they'd be getting taxed at theor actual pay.", "Right? Why have a tip jar if you're just going to assume they didn't tip and demand a second tip. Seems like a really confusing and unnecessary system, or perhaps line you said to guilt trip people into a second tip.", "As someone who worked in food service, I can tell you that when you do this, most managers will be obsequious and apologetic to your face. And then they\u2019ll come talk smack about you as a bad tipper and a self-righteous customer to the other staff member. You\u2019re not accomplishing what you think you\u2019re accomplishing when you try to play the \u201cI will never visit this establishment again\u201d card. \n\nFrankly, most establishments don\u2019t want this kind of customer and don\u2019t try to curate this clientele. It\u2019s never okay to not leave a tip. Tipping is literally paying for the service of eating out. If you don\u2019t want to pay food service workers, then stay home.", "you even brought the food back to the table yourself, your tip was way too generous \ud83d\ude2d but that\u2019s still real nice of you, i don\u2019t understand her attitude at all. again you\u2019re NTA in my opinion :)", "He tipped 50% in cash to bring his items himself and have to go back for his forgotten pretzel but  'you don't want customers like him!\n\nY'all need to get over yourselves, some of y'all deserve 0 i stg", "It is always okay to not tip. If the service is terrible, I will never tip. Tips are not mandatory.", "The issue is OP *DID* tip already.", "Me personally?  I always tip.  Even at the grocery store, I will leave a fiver for the bagger.  But relating this to the OP...the OP did tip (well!) and was still hassled by the idiot who expected him to tip by credit card.  (and gave him shit when he didn't)\n\nI believe you should indeed leave a tip if service was at least acceptable.  But if tips are mandatory, then that defeats the whole purpose of tipping in the first place.   And for someone to demand a tip is rude in the extreme.\n\nIf a manager can't understand that a rude staff member destroyed the experience for a  customer to the point where that customer won't be back...\n\nThen that manager really needs to find another career.  If I was the owner of the restaurant, I would want managers to take all complaints from customers VERY SERIOUSLY, as any feedback (good, bad, or indifferent) is an opportunity to improve the business.", "AND had to go hunting for the pretzel.", "Tips are not legally required, but they are ethically mandatory. \n\nMany service workers in tipped roles get less than minimum wage salary. \n\nDon\u2019t take your issue with the system out on the lowest members of the power hierarchy.

Every new fact I learn about the US just makes me sad these days, it's such an unnecessarily bad system.", "$10 for 2 minutes doesn't seem bad to me. Constant flow of customers. This bar person is racking it in. They've got greedy and it needs to change", "When I was a waitress in Ohio, I made $2.13 before tax per hour without tips.", "They didn\u2019t see OP tip the first time. Whatever frustration OP perceived later is subjective.", "You agreed to that contract between yourself and your employer at the time, the customers are not involved in the written agreement and therefore have no obligation to supply your wage. If we were talking about any other industry tipping wouldn't make sense.\n\nA customer should be able to purchase a good or service from a business at a fair and mutually agreeable price, without tacked-on \"you don't have to, but think of how little they get paid\" after charges. Employers should pay their employees a fair and mutually agreeable wage, without vague promises of customers being socially coerced to make up the shortfall."]}
