I have had Dixie since she was born and have spent the last two years raising her to be my service dog, spending thousands of dollars and countless hours. Over the holidays, I brought Dixie with me to see family. My aunt (51f) loves dogs and Dixie is super sweet, so my aunt was glued to her. On the third day of visiting, my aunt asked to take Dixie for a walk. I was fine with it, but I couldn't go with them because I was helping in the kitchen. So my aunt and Dixie go on their walk and I continue with my work. I was also grateful that someone else was willing to take her because Dixie is a high-energy dog (Australian shepherd) and only gets tired after about three miles.\n\nSomething to know about Dixie is that ever since she was a puppy, she has had a habit of holding things in her mouth when she is excited. Generally, this is one of her toys, but if she doesn't have a toy around, she'll grab whatever is closest. I know this is a habit of hers, so when we go outside, she always brings her raccoon when she is off duty. She did on this walk as well. However, my aunt took it away from her as they were leaving and left it by the front door. I don't see this aunt very often, but I did tell her that Dixie takes the raccoon everywhere.\n\nOn their walk, Dixie picked up a sizeable rock to hold in her mouth. My aunt tried to take this away as well, and Dixie resisted. In trying to keep the rock, she accidentally swallowed it. My aunt came back right away, and I took Dixie to the nearest emergency vet, over three hours away. (It was past 8 pm at this point and all the vets in between were closed for the night.) Dixie ended up needing surgery to remove the rock and repair the damage to her throat, but she is expected to recover well.\n\nAs I was waiting, I called my family to tell them that Dixie was in surgery. My family all expressed their sympathy and my aunt apologized for letting this happen. Once I was done on the phone, I texted my aunt asking for her to pay the vet bill, which ended up coming to almost $2000. She called me an AH for asking her and not accepting her apology. While I do accept her apology, and I know accidents happen, this is a big expense that is more of a burden on me than her. My aunt is a multimillionaire who just spent ten times that on a lavish tropical vacation. As a college student, this would wipe out my savings and I need the money to pay my tuition for the upcoming semester. She is now downstairs complaining about my entitlement to my entire family, and most of them agree with her. So, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: We were all at my mom's brother's house, who is also my aunt's brother.

I am a service dog handler and a dog lover in general. I am sorry your dog was harmed. If your SD is compulsively putting choking hazards in her mouth, you, as a handler, should train that behavior out. Until the dog is not doing dangerous behavior, you shouldn't have allowed a person not to be very familiar with the safety measures needed to take custody of your dog. You should also have pet insurance for your animal.   Your aunt knowing your dog likes to take a raccoon toy everywhere isn't the same as her, knowing that you are using that to redirect dangerous behaviors. My SD is 2, a Shetland sheepdog, and destructive when allowed to be, which is a potential choking hazard. (As in, he's on point when working or with me, but if left alone, likes to shred paper). I work on training, and until he grows out of the stage, I am very selective about who he's with. He's insured.", "Info: what service does it provide? \n\nOtherwise YTA on the current evidence.", "YTA \n\nThat is not a trained service dog if they are actively engaging in such behavior.\n\nAs a service dog owner, these dogs are specifically trained to avoid outside stimuli and undergo extensive training to be unobtrusive and very well behaved. Service dogs are trained as puppies, and they are taught how to deal with things and how to avoid things. \n\nYour dog is not a trained service dog. Just because you pay for doggy classes does not make it a service dog. I paid over $30,000 for my service dog, mainly because I wanted a specific breed and he came with papers as he\u2019s a purebred German Shepard (highly specialized service dogs cost even more).

The dog should not have an issue with the \u201cdrop it\u201d command such that it would need things pried out of its mouth, and you should have more clearly warned your aunt if your dog isn\u2019t well trained and this presented an issue. \n\nAnd ultimately, regardless of that situation, it\u2019s your job to provide care for the dog: I am personally from a family where paying thousands of dollars for surgery for a dog would simply not be done. Even if the money was technically there in savings, the budget for animal care did not cover thousands of dollars of emergency bills. Part of getting  a dog for me was ensuring that I was able to financially handle the burden, which included a plan for how to handle an expensive emergency should it arise. For some people this means having enough for euthanasia on hand; for some people this means buying pet insurance; for some people this means keeping savings on hand for an emergency. Your job as a pet owner is having that plan in place. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect anyone\u2019s else to sign up to pay for those costs.\n\nI do think it would be nice of her to help pay for it, but if you try to push this and act entitled, you\u2019re going to be hurting your chances of getting financial help and likely embarrassing yourself.", "ESA =/= Service animal. Sorry your pet ate a rock. YTA", "YTA - First, you don\u2019t have pet insurance. Big mistake.

Most of them would be kicked out of service dog school for the behavior your mentioned.\n\nIf you trained her since she was a puppy, then she was not really working for you as a service dog for quite some time. Exactly what service did you need and how did you do without her while she was in training? How are you getting along now that she's out of commission?\n\nSorry, but I don't believe she is really a service dog. It's people like you who make it hard for people like the blind to have service dogs. YTA for having a poorly trained \"service dog.\"", "Hm, I feel for you, however, I think you dropped the ball here on a few things, and you\u2019re young so I understand that, but this might be a lesson for the future. You didn\u2019t make it clear to your aunt that Dixie needed the raccoon so as to not pick things up on the walk. She should also be muzzled if the situation is so dire emergencies like this can happen, especially since you were putting her safety into the hands of someone you didn\u2019t appear to inform properly or her potentially picking something up. It was your responsibility to ensure your dog\u2019s safety was met, even if your aunt was responsible for her on the walk. If your dog had a history of tugging on a walk that could lead to someone losing control of a leash, the same would apply\u2014you have to inform the person you\u2019re giving responsibility to of the best course of action to keep the dog safe (or refuse to hand over responsibility at all).\n\nYes, your aunt is somewhat responsible for Dixie swallowing the rock though Dixie swallowing the rock was an accident (she did try to take it away). However, if she wants to contribute to the vet bill is up to her and not an obligation. Would it be nice of her? Yes. Would I do it if I were in the care of a dog and a terrible accident happened? Yes. But it is not her responsibility\u2014that is on you.\n\nI feel very sorry this would wipe out your savings but might be something to think about in the future. Pet bills (especially emergency ones) are extremely expensive, and oftentimes people find that out much too late and don\u2019t account for possible pet emergencies when sorting out finances for the year. I\u2019ve been there\u2014but for the sake of your pet, please consider this.\n\nHard to give a judgment because in principle I agree with you (as I would pay for that bill if your dog was under my watch, even if you didn\u2019t put all the checks and balances in place), but soft YTA for now (mostly because I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s clear from your post that you know why what happened happened\u2014all actions that led up to this were your own). Really wishing well for your dog and you!", "NTA! This is one of those situations when your relative means absolutely matter. Technically your dog is always your responsibility, but when the problem happened on your aunt's watch and she is easily able to afford the bill, it would be the right thing for her to pay for it. This would be a totally different situation if it had been a fellow broke college student who was walking Dixie at the time.", "YTA \nTelling someone a dog takes a toy everywhere is a far cry from telling someone that the dog will pick up random objects without said toy. Your aunt probably thought as a \"service dog\", it would know basic commands such as drop it. Please don't take the dog in stores and such, it's nowhere near the level it needs to be to handle that.", "If a service animal that is trained right, finding an object to grab is taking the dog\u2019s mind away from the job. On duty/off duty shouldn\u2019t matter. I see where others seem to think the raccoon toy is like a way to get around not dealing with the issue of putting objects in the mouth. Like a pacifier. Bet the dog is smart enough to learn to not do it at all. Going with negligence on your part.

If I'm watching somebody else's dog and something happens on my watch.  I would personally pay for it.

A shelter dog can become a service dog. However, in order to be granted the public access afforded to service dogs, it needs to also meet certain standards of public behavior. The dog must be under the control of the handler at all times, must be housebroken, and should not be barking or otherwise causing a nuisance.

A trained dog is not a service dog because they are not performing a specific job.", "\u201cDixie takes the raccoon everywhere\u201d is not an instruction. \u201cIf you take her on a walk she needs to have the raccoon or else she may swallow random objects\u201d is an instruction. \n\nThis dog is not trained properly and that is the owner\u2019s fault.", "\"Time for training later\"?  According to OP this is a service dog that she has spent thousands of dollars and hours training.  It should be trained already, and \"leave it\" or \"drop it\" are easy ones.  \nI'm thinking this is not actually a service dog, but rather an emotional support animal.  \nOP, what tasks does this dog perform?  Is this dog required because of a diagnosed disability?", "Just because your specific condition required a very specific dog, doesn\u2019t mean every condition does. I agree with you that not every dog has the aptitude to be a service dog, and that some conditions require a very specific aptitude. There are also a lot of helpful tasks that are very easy to train most breeds for. \n\nFull disclosure: most of my experience comes from running a large event where people often tried to fake their pets as service dogs in order to bring them. I had to do a deep dive into this specific aspect of the law, because we needed to develop a policy around it that didn\u2019t place a burden on handlers of actual service animals. In the research phase, I talked to a lot of service dog handlers about tasks and training. It was honestly about a 50/50 split between people who had very expensive highly trained dogs, and people who had rescue animals that they selected for aptitude and then trained inexpensively. It really depended on the type of tasks they needed assistance with. \n\nMy own dogs notice my oncoming PTSD attacks before I do, and will try to intentionally distract me. If that fails, they get on me to apply weight. I only trained the older one to do that, the younger one learned by watching. Neither of them is a service dog, and I would not try to pass them off as one. They\u2019re terrible on leash and in public, utter nuisances despite professional training. \n\nMy point is that there is a lot of nuance, and your argument leaves a lot of legitimate handlers out.", "Legit trainers are very rare imo. And it\u2019s even rarer to see service dogs who haven\u2019t been professionally trained. I just come across poorly trained pets whose owners pretend they are service dogs. I respect anyone who can actually train their dogs to do a specific job, but that takes immense effort and time and patience, things most people seem to lack.\n\nThe vast majority of people think because their dogs take a few doggy classes or pay someone who claims to be a dog trainer to teach basic tricks their dog is now qualified as a service dog.

On the walk, your aunt doesn't notice the scarf has slipped off and she loses it. Going back over the walk does not find the scarf. Does she owe you the price of the scarf?

She was doing you a favour.\n\nDixie swallowing a stone is a freak accident. I'm kinda surprised though that your dog didn't listen when told to drop the stone.

I'm sure there are legitimate trainers with disabilities who train their own service dogs to be service dogs.

There's a final exam, and an exam every year to make sure the handler is keeping up with training.

It\u2019s also smart to use the standard phrase, for just this situation.  I\u2019m a big fan of odd words for service dog tasks, so the general public doesn\u2019t confuse or add stress to the dog (having to ignore commands from other than owner requires work from the dog), but drop it for something dangerous is important.  \n\nAlso a dog that must carry something isn\u2019t ready to be a service dog.", "Absolutely not.

It's not true that all valid service dogs cost 10k or more.\n\nPersonally, I think ethical SD trainers need to teach beyond the basics required by law.
