NTA at all for not wanting to waste your time", "NTA. \n\n\"Go without me,\" is a very reasonable solution here.  I don't like chronically late people in my life. I'm  busy and I really hate making and keeping a schedule to respect someone's time, only to end up waiting in a parking lot or outside their home for half an hour.\n\nIf your husband wants to spend his free time waiting on them, that's his choice.  But for group situations, it's acceptable not to want chronically late people in situations where lateness has an impact (like dinner, concerts, and road trips).\n\nEta: a solution I found in my 30s is to invite those people to events where their lateness has no impact on my experience.  Like parties or public events.", "NTA. Being on time is how you show respect. Obviously he doesn't respect you, so why would you want to spend your valuable time with him?", "NTA. If husband won\u2019t go without you that\u2019s on him.", "NTA, by a long shot. Your husbands BFF doesn\u2019t respect you or your husband. The fact that your husband isn\u2019t also pissed about it suggests a bizarre imbalance in that friendship and frankly, it would probably be good for your husband to take a bit of a step back, but that\u2019s his call\u2026 you gave him the choice.\n\nIf you do attempt to continue a friendship with this guy, you have to find a way to enforce consequences for the tardiness and stick to your guns (ex. If they\u2019re late for dinner, find another restaurant and eat there\u2026 when he texts asking where you are: \u201cwe were hungry so we ate. Heading home now because we\u2019re tired. Show up on time next time\u201d or \u201cwe have a tight schedule and don\u2019t want to miss the start of the movie, you\u2019re clearly not ready so you\u2019ll have to find your own ride\u201d).\n\nPeople like this don\u2019t change unless there\u2019s consequences. If there\u2019s consequences and they still don\u2019t change\u2026 well, then they were never really your friend anyway.", "NTA. I'm of the opinion that if you tell someone you'll meet at 09:00, you should be there at 08:55. This guy didn't even get out of bed for you.\n\nTell him if you have to wait longer than 5 mins, you are going home.", "Is he also late for things that impact his life? Does he get to work on time? Either he has a problem with executive function and time blindness or he is an entitled prick. If he has ADHD/autism etc with time blindness, there are lots of ways to manage it. Apps and alarms and planning work for many. The way he waves you off and refuses to apologize or make changes implies he is a prick, even if he is time blind. NTA.", "NTA but your husband\u2019s response is kind of weird. I wouldn\u2019t tolerate his friend\u2019s behavior from anyone in my life, so I can\u2019t understand why your husband isn\u2019t more on your side. Especially with the way his friend brushed you off. Never would let my best buddy get away with either of those things. Regardless you need to put your foot down. Tell your husband you\u2019re not going, and please show him this post and maybe he\u2019ll come to his senses. I can\u2019t imagine ever letting someone treat me like this over and over again and just be like \u201coh it\u2019s okay.\u201d Nope. It\u2019s super inconsiderate, rude behavior. I\u2019m actually concerned your husband\u2019s bff secretly hates him, and your husband just can\u2019t take a hint.", "NTA. When I first started dating my wife she was always late. I mean every time we did anything wether it was just the two of us or we were meeting friends. I finally had enough and sat her down and said do you think you are more important than me and our friends? Do you have no respect us? Because every time you make everybody wait on you that\u2018s what you are saying. I\u2019m more important than everybody else and I don\u2019t respect your time at all. I\u2019ll give her credit she apologized and stopped doing it, but man that was almost a deal breaker when we first started dating. Your friend is a selfish AH and you should tell him that and stop putting up with this crap wether you husband likes it or not.", "NTA. This is extremely disrespectful behaviour and I wouldn\u2019t want to put up with it either. You\u2019re perfectly justified in refusing to put up with it anymore.", "NTA. If your husband wants to wait, fine. Drive without him. Let him wait. If you want to do whatever you plan and you're fine doing it alone, drive alone, and do it on time. Your husband will bitch and moan when he misses out. That's his choice.", "Nta. Being late is so rude! Either start telling him shit starts 2 hours earlier than it actually does or stop doing stuff with him.", "NTA\n\nHe can go without you or not go. Because you're right not to go.", "There's a simple solution: from now on, you yourself simply don't take part in any event involving this couple. If it's dinner at a cafe, you stay home or go out with friends. If it's a movie, you stay home and stream.\n\nAnd so on. If your husband wants to undergo this outrageous assault on his time from his friend, let him go. You stay away.\n\nNTA, and these people will never change. They live \"outside\" of time, because they're lazy and it's easy. Don't let them stiff you even once more.", "NTA - if your hubby wants to deal with that shit it can be on solo visits", "NTA\n\nBut stop waiting so long. Gove them 15 minutes and then leave", "Not caring about other peoples times is just fucking disrespectful as is. On too when you communicated your feelings and frustration they didnt care about that either. The husband should just go alone seriously NTA", "He waved you away with his hand like a gnat, because that's exactly how he feels about you. You are not important enough to be considerate to. NTA.", "NTA it is a very reasonable solution\u2026your husband just doesn\u2019t want to be waiting for hours alone every time they have plans", "NTA.
