If she won\u2019t take care of her vanity, she reaps what she sowed. Maybe give her some skincare tips, like getting sleep, staying hydrated and maybe even recommend a facial moisturizer for her. Giving her a solution to her problem might raise her self-esteem, ofc this is just to say she doesn\u2019t know where to begin rather than having the knowledge and just seethes in jealousy. If she doesn\u2019t take that advice and run with it then that\u2019s her problem fully, she no longer has a valid reason to complain about you being more prettier than her. Family torn? Tell them you tried helping her with her health and skincare, they can\u2019t really complain then. Jealousy is hideous anyways\n\nEdit: I just want to say that I personally don\u2019t agree with the specific insult OP used against her sister however, OP\u2019s sister has been essentially just stating \u201cyou\u2019re nothing without your looks\u201d making OP\u2019s achievements less deserving of praise by saying that. It\u2019s not right to call someone ugly when you know they\u2019re insecure, but OP\u2019s clearly fed up with being reduced to just her looks and it probably just slipped out. Does it mean she\u2019s the AH though? Bro no, never wtf, everyone has a limit on their patience and hurtful things can slip out. Her sister does it all the time and seems to not be able to control her envy, I can guarantee you many people reading this post have called their siblings some worse stuff or vice versa out of rage or annoyance.

It's just a product of being an AFAB person in an engineering office. Nobody assumes you're the engineer they came to talk to. I don't know what this is like in fields that aren't male dominated because I've only worked in this field.\n\nAlso, when you're conventionally attractive, the hostility comes from peers or subordinates. They're punching laterally or up. \"Oh she only got hired because she's hot.\" or whatever. When you're visibly queer and not attractive by straight man standards, the hostility comes from above. When I came back from the pandemic with my current appearance, I was shocked how borderline violent men got with me if I disagreed with them or questioned them in the exact same ways I had for my entire career. I want to emphasize that these were The. Same. Men. Only my appearance had changed. I was threatened with termination and demotion \"for persistent disrespect\" when I gave the same comments I had been giving in the same instances for my entire career. Men in power love a pretty girl they think they could theoretically fuck (even if they never hit on her or anything like that) but seem to feel threatened by an androgynous lesbian who says exactly the same things. It's really disconcerting to be punched down at. I quit a job I had done great at for years over this, and left the job I got after that over the boss left and another one came in with the same flavor of hostility. It wasn't an isolated incident. Being punched down at is a whole other level of difficulty because HR believes those guys over you every time whereas they would deal with whatever subordinate or peer got stupid before simply because I was the more expensive asset to replace.\n\nSo basically, there's still pretty privilege going on even when experiencing the backlash that comes with being conventionally attractive in the workplace for women and femmes. I honestly had no idea how much worse it could be until I got smacked in the face with it.", "It's great for getting out of small things. People are quick to forgive an attractive person for minor missteps, and I'm fairly sure I've dodged a speeding ticket or two with a nice \"oh dear, in so sorry, I'm such a klutz.\" \n\nProfessionally, it really sucks. Middle aged men do not want to work under an attractive young women as their manager. I have actually been told directly that I was being passed over for promotion because I don't \"exude authority.\" I have also had a new employee *in training* say to me \"I don't need a little girl telling me what to do.\" \n\nI acknowledge there are pros, but there are plenty of painful cons that people are resistant to recognize too. Just look at how it's affected OP's relationship with her sister and put her in the middle of this petty drama with her family.", "It can also be a liability because of people like op's sister, who treat others as less than because of their own jealousy and insecurity. \n\nI'm not ugly but not great looking either, but I still got this treatment anytime I worked in an environment with multiple older women. To be fair, it was only a few of them and the rest were great. But the ones who were like that would go out of their way to be unkind, point out flaws, gossip about me to each other and to customers, anything they could think of to try to bring me down a peg. Any minor mistake would be corrected with the harshest tone and fast, disrespectful movement like slamming things down in front of me. If they found even one thing to drag me for, that would be the highlight of their day. Like one day they reported me to the manager because the back of my shirt was a bit wrinkled. If I said even one thing back to them, they'd go dancing over to the next one they knew who was like themselves, face glowing with happiness because they'd gotten under my skin, just to crow about getting a reaction. It was a constant battle with them and one job I had to quit because it was never going to improve and was making me depressed and anxious to come into work to the point of sobbing on my way there. \n\nSo yeah, there's some privileges to being younger or prettier sometimes but in the wrong environment, with people like op's sister, it can make someone a target of bullying and harassment too.", "I can\u2019t remember the source for this, but I read somewhere more attractive women were more likely to get hired, but less likely to get promoted and taken seriously/respected in their job.

Pretty privilege is little things being done for you/bought for you by others. Specifically at my restaurant job, you\u2019ll notice what women are given free food by the chefs.

So those guys, they felt good, you felt good. Everyone wins here. Not everyone gets to experience this (men, particularly) but that is unfortunately just life.

There's a ton of people who look great without the effort or money OP implies they invested in themself. There's definitely people who would find that sort of dedication off putting in a person, while others would celebrate it. We have zero clue what OP or their sister looks like, but we do know OP's tone and description looks down on sister's looks for not being like hers. Sister looks down on OP for the same situation, just flipped \n\nThat is petty. They are both doing the same thing, just in reverse from each other.\n\nIf OP had said something along the lines of criticizing sister's effort, it would have been justified, but it's OPs overall tone toward sis and specifically pulling out tge ugly card that puts OP in the petty category", "Everyone sucks here", "It's not even that hard to pass a driving test, that's incredibly insulting. Oh yeah, the instructor only passed her because she's pretty even though most of the population passes, like 99% + of people?\n\nThat's a psychotic thing to say or think.\n\nHer sister is basically saying she thinks she's mentally impaired and shouldn't be allowed to drive with the vast majority of the population, but her good looks are keeping her afloat in the population.

Hell no, becsuse the issue is not that he/she does not know that. The fat person knows they are fat and that it is bad.

But as grown-ups, there are absolutely ways to dress and present ourselves that show our best. For me personally, when I dress my best I behave my best. For example if I think I screwed up at work or something, the next day I will wear and look my best. Because it will get me the confidence to get through the day. I know a lot of people don't feel this way or don't get how I feel.\n\nThat being said, there is no question that your first impression of somebody is how they look. Because that's what you see first. First impression. And whether we like it or not, how you look will it affect your first impression. Fair or unfair that's how we are. You sound like someone who has learned this lesson and who takes the time to present themselves in a very positive way. Your sister is different and that's okay. But she has every capability the same as you to present herself at her best. So sour grapes is not an option.

Like if you\u2019re gonna be an ass to someone based off their looks don\u2019t be mad when they do it back straight to your face, it might be petty, but it sounds like OP has run out of patience with her 25 year old sister who acts like a jealous 15y.o scrolling on instagram. \ud83e\udd37", "Idk what men you hang out with but not all men are so neglectful of themselves, and the very existence of the term neckbeard as a slur should indicate to you, if you have the capacity for that kind of thought, that men are held to a standard of appearance and self care.", "> So your answer is to be an asshole to someone that was an asshole to you?\n\nIf someone is an asshole to me over and over and over and over and over and over and I am an asshole to them one time I am as bad as them?", "You missed my entire point. You missed my entire perspective. Maybe I'm a bad communicator. Rather than talk passed each other I am going to wish you a wonderful day. I hope you have happiness and prosperity in your life. Cheers.", "Are you perfect?? \n\nEver heard of new parents suddenly discovering they have another side of themselves after endless nights of not sleeping properly?? \n\nI didn't say they get a pass forever. But like, yeah, get therapy sure, But she's a teen, it's not their fault that their parents didn't put a stop to this WAY earlier on. You think that the kids are the ones to blame for what should have been the parent's job to see that they're strugling and to break up the disputes and bring in therapists and............ \n\nIt's interesting that you automatically get so worked up about that. Do you feel abused by your siblings? Guess what, your parents should have done something about that, shouldn't take that on so hard yourself. \n\nAlso, the OP is like a teenager... she can't \"act adult\" because she's NOT an adult.", ">One is definitely present and has been documented, the other one is feel-based\n\nYour comment is extremely vague, but I am guessing that you are saying that the phenomenon of being treated better when you are more attractive is the \"present and documented\" one, and that the phenomenon of being nicer to people when you are treated nicer, and therefore receiving more niceness back, is the one that is \"feel-based.\"\n\nI mean, wouldn't being treated nicer because you are more attractive also be \"feel-based\" ?     You feel that you are being treated nicer.   I know there have been studies performed with 3rd-party, 'objective' evaluators   (true objectivity in science, especially social sciences, is an impossibility)   but it still is the perception of treatment, which is an emotional response whether or not it is happening to you, or another party.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>may or may not apply in different degrees to each individual\n\nAll human interactions apply in different degrees.  Just like being treated better because you are better looking.  There are plenty of individual examples where being better looking leads to worse treatment.  For example, female doctors/engineers regularly report that being more attractive actively hurts your career because you are taken less seriously.   Attractive people are often accused of having gotten somewhere based on looks and not skill.   Attractive people get hit on by not nice people and when rejected or ignored, that turns into harassment.  \n\nUgly people like to blame their difficulties in life on their looks, and in many cases are correct.  But it's easy to blame all of one's troubles on one flaw and falsely perceive a lot of interactions as being caused by it.  Self-fulfilling prophecy.", "Yeah, that is bullshit", "Nah all good there! It's always good to get a bit deeper into the characters you write. Your characters all sound interesting!\n\nI will say though, although there are loads of people who definitely present themselves as queer (like in the above styles) there are always people who are queer and don't. So you definitely will find lesbians who would be mistaken for straight women, or who will appeal to those seeking conventional beauty standards as well. So it's really important to not think as these aesthetics as stereotypes. There is no correct way to \"look gay.\"\n\nBut in my experience as a lesbian and in the community the attraction to women and femmes lies in seeing that person flourish as their authentic selves while being unashamedly them. So for some that's shaved head, being a larger sized, wearing men's clothing and not shaving their body. For others it's expressing their creativity through fashion, texture and colours or living up their cottage core traditional feminine selves. It's all about loving the woman being herself.\n\nBtw, I absolutely do adore body hair on women, as I do stretch marks, cellulite, scars, tummy rolls etc. I guess that also comes into the straight hot vs queer hot thing as well. We seem to be a lot less discerning about the \"imperfections\" of women.", "Kind of a different vibe when she started it", "Or just something autocorrect wouldn\u2019t catch because it\u2019s an actual word.", "why wouldn\u2019t she just point out it\u2019s illogical, or tell her it hurts her feelings, or any other way really? why would it make sense to call her ugly? especially since the real point to be made is that the test has nothing to do with looks? calling her ugly just makes it seem like \u201cok u could have pretty privilege too if u were just more like me\u201d. Also, being criticized for being pretty is hardly equivalent to being criticized for being ugly.", "Because sometimes you can and should call your loved one ugly. Like this sister.", "idk people are acting like she had two choices and those were either let her do it or call her ugly. as if there are not tons of other non-asshole ways to approach the situation.", "Neckbeard isn\u2019t a slur. Men are held to some expectations regarding physical appearance but it\u2019s not to the same degree.", "My question would be what tactic did OP used when talking to her sister previously? I suspect, because of what we do know she said in her \u201coutburst\u201d, that OP communicates in \u201cyou\u201d statements. You are jealous, you could do these things to look better. She might get some were with \u201cI\u201d statements. \u201cI don\u2019t like when you diminish my accomplishments, I spend a lot of time and money to look like this. So she may have talked to her before, but that doesn\u2019t mean she communicated effectively or set a good boundary. \n\nLike so many issues on AITA, talking may have happened, but we don\u2019t know if effective communication ever happened.", "Am I saying don't be an asshole? No. Unless you don't want to be the AH. Be an ass. I truly don't care. I'll be an ass too. But she's in a subreddit for AITA and NOT Who is the bigger AH. So, yes, in this case, I answered ESH \u263a\ufe0f", "> No one has an endless supply of patience.\n\nTrue but it doesn't mean that when you do mess up, you shouldn't acknowledge. Part of being a better human is to acknowledge when you're an asshole and improve upon it.", "It didn't say anywhere in the post that OP is a teen nor did it sound like it. As adults, it's our own responsibility to work on our behaviour.", "Meanwhile, I\u2019m pretty tall and hate ankle length pants because they just make me look like I couldn\u2019t find pants long enough. But the \u201clong\u201d ankle length pants are too long. I\u2019m tall but I\u2019m not *that* tall. It\u2019s so hard to find a well fitting pair of pants that I bought a sewing machine so I can just make my own.", "My cousin was telling me flare pants are back and it made me so sad! I hate having to hem my pants \ud83d\ude2d", "Not sure where you\u2019re located, but Old Navy is my go to for petite pants and is very inexpensive.", "In a thread about pretty privilege, you can't make this stuff up lol.\n\nGirl should try being an ugly stupid woman and see how successful of a relationship she can find.", "It\u2019s very equivalent when people say all your hard work paid off because of your looks. It\u2019s pretty much like saying \u201dyou couldn\u2019t have made it this far without having a pretty face/body\u201d as if OP doesn\u2019t have personality or intelligence, limiting her down to her physical appearance. Same goes for being called ugly. If this has been going on for years, which it seems like it has due to them being in their mid-20\u2019s why can\u2019t she call her own sister ugly just once? Her sister had been talking shit about her for years and the one time she can\u2019t take it anymore she\u2019s the asshole? Be so fr, if you had siblings you\u2019ve probably called them worse or around the same insults.", "Where did you get \u201call the time\u201d? She said it this one singular time, after literal years of being dismissed, devalued, and denigrated. OP is NTA, and you have zero reading comprehension. Also, unkempt and ungroomed is unattractive\u2014which is a synonym for ugly.", "Sounds like she communicated pretty effectively this time.\n\nNTA OP.", "At some point you\u2019re just a pushover \ud83d\ude43 good luck with that approach in life.", "people in this sub just have a revenge boner and think justifiable assholery means you did everything right sweetie talk shit get hit", "You know that you're in a forum specifically dedicated to DECIDING WHETHER SOMEONE IS AN ASSHOLE OR NOT. And by association, every single one here reading or commenting on it is indulging in assholery right?? Like you're not above that. \n\nSomeone who's not an asshole, does not judge others. \n\nYou're judging right now, so am I. But at least admit it.", "you must be american. That's a completely individualistic point of view. There's no societal function, other people don't affect in any way, the past doesn't matter.... \n\nThe sister is a young adult, if OP is an adult, I think someone in the comments looked into it and her age still begins with a 1.", "so you\u2019re willing to give the sister the benefit of the doubt but not OP? she might have a high opinion of her appearance, but that doesn\u2019t make her inherently mean, and it sounds like she\u2019s at least attempted to stay civil or even help.", "No, I didnt care enough to. It wasn\u2019t hurting me.\n\nI have my own stuff going on that, how she dressed is so low on the scale until she started all the pretty privilege", "I'm not American lol. All I'm saying is you can't go around mistreating others just because you didn't have perfect parents. Trauma is 100% real but not an excuse", "well OP is the one telling the story, of course she's going to cast herself in the best light possible", "It seems like you're very sensitive to being called ugly. \n\nAre you sure that that word itself doesn't cause you do automatic asshole calling as soon as you hear that word regardless of its context?? \n\nI had that moment too when I read the title. BUT on reading the actual story, the sister can dish it but can't take it?? You diminish someone else by saying they're TOO pretty, meaning she's actually calling herself ugly. The OP just finally had enough and took her up on what she's been calling herself all along. Sure they clearly have sisterly rivalry about appearances, but OP keep saying they have the same features meaning she's not actually judging her sister that hard for it-- until the sister stepped over a line.\n\n\nand reading comments that say things like \"in the south of the US, calling someone ugly can also mean 'you're acting ugly, your attitude is ugly'\". \n\nThat applies too.", "Then I would say NTA"]}
