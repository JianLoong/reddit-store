Ended up sat alone at bar. And I found out after that wearing red to a wedding can be seen as you've slept with the groom. When my hubby found out he was laughing his head off. He's never touched her and doesn'tsee her that way..... yet an old bf of mine from years ago, who is also a good friend of hubbys, was at our wedding.  The wedding was the first time we'd seen each other in 25 years lol.\n\nDon't worry, she's going to make a spectacle of herself and people will stare and she'll end up feeling foolish.

I was actually delighted. \n\nI wouldn't try to stop someone from telling their bridal party how to dress, even though I didn't choose to do it myself. But trying to tell *all your guests* how to dress is more than a bit extra. \n\nA lot of brides and some grooms forget that this is not only \"their special day,\" but a party they are hosting for other people, and that they are just as bound by the rules of hospitality and courtesy to guests as they would be in hosting any other party.", "I saw a YT reaction vid where bridesmaids (with mermaid hair) were asked to dye hair, and one who cut hers was asked to wear a wig.", "That was definitely a thing when I was growing up (90s/2000s), but it doesn't seem to really be around as much anymore.

You either provide them with everything you want them to display, after asking if they are willing to, and shut up and thank them for coming after all, or you'll ask if they have something that fits your idea, and if they don't you thank them personally, receive them anyway, feed them, give them drinks, a trinket and a thank you card.

Some variation of this idea has been around since at least the 80s: wearing red means you\u2019re bold, slept with the groom, want to sleep with the groom, promiscuous, attention-seeking, etc.\n\nLet me put it this way. There\u2019s a theory that police stop more red cars than any other color. Why? Red is a bold, bright color (depending on the shade); it pops, attracts the eye. You\u2019re going to pick it out of a crowd easier. The same theory goes for a woman wearing red at a wedding.\n\nAnd, so just like \u201cdon\u2019t wear white because people may mistake you for the bride\u201d, it was determined that red is not a good guest color at a wedding because it could take attention away from the bride.
