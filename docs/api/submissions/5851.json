They had no right to help themselves to a cake they were not offered.  You are not wrong here at all.  As a matter of fact they should pay you back for the ingredients.  They know you bake cakes for others and shouldn't have just helped themselves.  I was a baker for 5 years and some cakes are time consuming and take a lot of expensive ingredients.   It is not that easy- if it was EVERYONE would be a baker.  He has zero respect for your time, money and artistry.   Then he doubles down and tries to play victim.  This is not a friend and I would not invite him over again for any cake testing.   He owes you an apology.", "NTA. Taking a piece of a fresh cake when calling on someone, without their consent, is most inappropriate. You had not left it out for them to consume. \n\nGet the 27M to work FOR you to remake the cake from scratch. That will clarify who the lazy ass person is.", "NTA\n\nThe nerve of 27M to call YOU a lazy ass when he helped himself to a piece of cake that he certainly hadn\u2019t baked and knew wasn\u2019t for him. The absolute nerve.", "NTA\n\nOP invited them over to try a different cake. What kind of jerk just opens someone else's refrigerator and takes food? That is so disrespectful.\n\nDon't let them call you lazy. Tell him he owes you the cost of remaking the cake. Factor in new ingredients and your time. Remember you are a skilled baker and should get paid accordingly. Lookup getting this cake professionally done and tell him what his actions cost.", "NTA - Tell the lazy ass to make the cake.", "NTA, your male friend is a giant asshole for taking something without asking and then calling you names. You should let him know that he\u2019s no longer welcome at you le house.", "Absolutely NTA. I can't believe the entitlement it would take to just steal a slice of cake from an untouched cake from someone else's fridge. Just not ok.\n\n\nI wouldn't be inviting that friend over anymore.", "NTA. Your friend was way out of line for that. I assume they knew what it was for. And not reasonable at all to expect you to do it all again, regardless of if you can or not. And then not only does he not apologize but insults you? He is an asshole for sure.", "NTA. I would encourage you to consider whether 27M is actually a friend to you though. Sometimes friends treat people badly and we don't apply the same standards of deserving respect as we might in a relationship and keep putting up with it.", "NTA. It's not about whether you have the ingredients, it takes time and effort. Your friend was a nobhead and I'd honestly have made him remake the cake for me, then made him eat the entire (failed) result as punishment for calling you an insult after *he* ruined your hard work! He's not a very good friend. Don't bake for these people any more.", "NTA. Stealing other people's food is a big no, & all of your friends should know that. It's not about whether you can make another cake, it's about the theft itself & the presumption that of course it'll be okay because you're 'friends'.", "NTA. That guy who ate the cake is NOT your friend.", "NTA, who walks into somebody's home and takes something from their fridge that is untouched?! He is so so SO rude and then to insult you after and be so flippant about it.. I'm so angry for you\nIs there any way that you could cut the cake into slices and take those along instead of a whole cake. Then its less work for you and its not wasted", "You're absolutely NTA. Only people who bake know how much effort and time go into it, it really is a thankless job/hobby (even when you enjoy it). I would have been so pissed, and if anyone did that to a cake my mom made, she would dump the whole thing.\nBut wtf, who just goes into the fridge and has a slice without asking???", "NTA. This was really rude and disrespectful of your friend. Yelling probably wasn't the best response on your part, though I understand why you were angry. Honestly your friends kinda suck.", "Absolutely NTA. You don't go into someone else's fridge and just eat random things. The host puts out what they intend to be eaten. And it doesn't matter if you can just make another one, because you shouldn't have to.", "NTA. How are you lazy?? This entitled dude straight up stole food from your fridge and thinks you\u2019re lazy because you don\u2019t want to make another?? How insane. He\u2019s not your friend, don\u2019t invite him over to taste test ever again. If he comments on it, tell him you\u2019re too lazy to bother.", "NTA - baking is time consuming and baking something you don\u2019t even like is very low reward. \n\nSide note: I love lemon and lavender cake - would you mind sharing your recipe with me?", "NTA. Anyone who just helps themselves to the insides of my fridge without express permission to do so isn't likely to get an invitation back to my home.", "NTA . If the shit so simple HE can make your replacement cake", "Oh noooooo NTA first of all nobody needs to be eating any of your food without permission. Especially an untouched cake. Who does that???? And then to call you lazy? Absolutely not, you had put in the work and he was absolutely in the wrong.", "NTA that was a super shitty thing for your \u201cfriend\u201d to do. He\u2019s not your friend. He\u2019s a user and an AH who tried to gaslight you into making you think you were a jerk. I don\u2019t really think any of these people are your friends. \n\nYou should send a group text saying that they owe you for the cake since you have to make a second. Since no one thinks what he did was wrong they should all be fine with splitting the cost with him. \n\nCharge them a lot.", "NTA\n\nThe 27M is not your friend.

In my opinion, people do things every day for other people they don't want to do, on the basis of compromise or consideration or something along the lines of that; basically, from the good of their heart. The fact she didn't want to do the cake in the first place should have made him stop in his tracks even more than the fact what he was doing crossed several boundaries and was outright rude. She was also doing a tasting, meaning he would already eaten some. Her friend, was rude, greedy, and inconsiderate towards the time and effort she put into it. It would be the same situation, if she was making a painting, and her friend came over and painted over a small portion of the painting, and then claimed she could just make another one. Her friend obviousky felt he was entitled to the cake despite the generosity of her to make it in the first place AS WELL AS give them a tasting since they love it so much. Overall, I think that OP is NTA and her friend is. This is also something to consider: OP mentioned she is autistic  and non confrontational, and from the info above, I get the feeling he was counting on that and taking advantage of the fact she is non confrontational in order to get away with his greed and entitlement.\n\nEdit: in other words, her reaction was warranted.", "Oh be quiet!

Which should be hundreds more than what it costs you in ingredients and time. Also it's not your friend and you shouldn't have it around anymore, this has nothing to do with autism and all to do with ah-ism.", "I\u2019m going to actually say NAH. This doesn\u2019t sound like a clear cut situation, and I suspect it was an emotion fueled misunderstanding all around. \n\nWhen emotions are high, social mistakes are more likely to happen. It\u2019s important to recognize how each person felt in the moment, before casting judgment. I know this can be difficult for people on the spectrum, but it\u2019s important to try. So let\u2019s look at that: \n\n- You were already stressed from making the cake. If your anything like my son, who is on the spectrum, your emotions were likely a bit raw already. Doing things he finds stressful impacts the rest of his day, and leaves him on edge. Once you perceived the cake, you worked so hard on, to be ruined those raw emotions flared. We can\u2019t always control our reactions, but we need to be able to look back and see where we made mistakes. Yelling was not the right choice, as it only escalated the situation.  \n\n- I doubt this friend maliciously ate your cake. Could it have all been a misunderstanding? You invited them to test cake, was it made absolutely 100% clear to *this* friend that the fridge cake was not for testing? As an outsider, this actually seems like an easy mistake to make, given the purpose of this social event was to try cake. \u201cI\u2019m here to eat cake, there\u2019s a cake.\u201d They we\u2019re happily eating cake, when suddenly they were verbally assaulted. Leaving them embarrassed and a little ashamed, so their defenses were up. They should not have said what they said, but they reacted poorly and said things they shouldn\u2019t have, due to these raised emotions. \n\nIt all sounds like a big misunderstanding that escalated due to heightened emotions. If you value their friendship, I feel like this could easily be mended by discussing what happened. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s one less person you have to share cake with!", "The guy who took a piece of cake knowing it was for an event is TA. He isn't your friend.
