Might get better once I finish fixing it up and start using it more, but it ain't great.\n\n2) They attack the other wildlife. I've seen those damn cats from my kitchen window, watched them stalking and leaping at birds. I like birds. I also like the hedgehogs and squirrels that scurry about. Stupid cats.\n\nI've started looking at cat repellants that are little machines which emit a sound cats don't like, effectively keeping them away but not bothering other animals. Also looking at blocking off gaps in the hedge and only leaving little hedgehog tunnels.\n\nThe problem with this is that with my garden smack bang in the middle of all other gardens (it's a row house situation, with my garden bordered on all sides by others), I'm cutting off the only access route for all neighbour cats. They'll all be stuck in their own gardens (have fun dealing with your own pets' poop for a change, neighbours) or will have to find alternate routes along the front of their houses next to the road.
