You were honest with your kid and this could be an important lesson. It sounds like your friend has an alcohol issue they aren't ready to admit let alone face.", "So pissed she can\u2019t find her own house and when it comes to facing the embarrassment she can\u2019t do it to the point where she tries making you feel guilty about it?\n\nNTA.", "NTA - If she is ashamed of getting that drunk, she shouldn't drink so much. Sucks you lost your babysitter though. Doesn't suck that you lost a friend who is willing to be so petty.", "NTA: you are very honest with your child, and that's great. My one question is why does she have a key to the house? I do not like unexpected visitors, and that would drive me nuts. That's yours and kids safe place. So if a drunk person randomly walked in I would be pissed also. Seems like it's time to set some hard boundaries for you and the kiddo.", "NTA. Sabrina is right to be embarrassed- she did something embarrassing! You didn't go out of your way to embarrass her, you *had* to explain something to your child about what was going on, and you're right that any other explanation wouldn't make enough sense to a fully rational 8 year old.\n\nSucks you're losing a babysitter over it though. :( Since she's probably feeling extremely embarrassed, it might help smooth things over to reassure her that neither you nor your child is judging her about it, Avery was just being curious and she'll forget about it soon as long as a big deal isn't made of it.", "NTA at all. Sabrina caused the situation. Your daughter saw her, even if you did take her to her room quickly. Lying would harm your relationship with your child, and honestly just not be effective.\n\nSabrina's embarrassment is Sabrina's problem. You did everything right.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake your key back, you can not trust her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
