I said that it would have been a waste of my moms holidays at work and the money she had already spent. My mom doesn't have the option of cancelling her days off and our flights were non-refundable.

I get it, traveling can be expensive and everything was booked in advance. It's important to see family and your mother was relying on you to be a travel companion. But your best friend's life was ripped apart by the death of a younger sibling.  \n\nYou can travel any time or if that's not financially viable, at another point in the future. Your friend really needed you this one time and you've shown her that a holiday is more important than them. That you can not be relied on during a time of need. It is unfathomable to me that to think that I would abandon my best friend while they were going through something like this.  \n\nPeople on Reddit will validate your decision because a large percentage of people online think that you don't owe anyone anything. This is a poor take, real life doesn't work like that. Sometimes life puts us in unfair situations and we need to make a choice, you chose poorly here. Don't be surprised if your friendship is unsalvageable, but I do hope you're able to work it out.", "Thank you, I appreciate that. The thought of her not thinking clearly did cross my mind so I dropped the whole argument, I offered to take 101% of the blame just so we could move past it. I'm not too worried about her giving me the silent treatment, she probably just has a lot on her mind and replying to me is not a priority. \n\nI'm just worried about what this will do to our shared friend group, I hope the time doesn't come when they're forced to take sides. Honestly I'd prefer for them to take her side. I can't imagine losing my friends after losing a brother.", "Actually during our argument I mentioned that perhaps she was misdirecting her feelings on the situation as anger towards me and she was not so happy about that. She accused me of putting her in a cliche box by putting the blame on me just to fit my narrative. \n\nShe also accused me of guilting her by telling her we don't have the liberty of seeing family and travelling is essential for us to do this. Obviously that fact is true but I never said it to guilt her, I was merely stating a fact.\n\nI hope she even gives me the chance to talk to her at this point.", "She does have family with her. She has 2 other siblings and both her parents, not including extended family like aunts, uncles, cousins, grandmother etc. \n\nHer SO, who is also my best friend was by her side the whole time too. I also asked my boyfriend to attend the funeral so he could offer support while I was away. \n\nWe've been friends since high school, about 12 years now.", "Apart from apologising, I didn't know what else to do. I didn't think I was being defensive, I honestly just explained my reasons for going, but I get that from her pov it was just an excuse which she deemed defensive. \n\nI, however, have already apologised to her about being defensive but again to no avail. I've also been giving her space. I just hope she comes around eventually.", "Thank you, that makes me feel a bit better. I just hope she forgives me eventually", "I hope it doesn't come to that but I'm prepared to accept if she doesn't move beyond it. \n\nI appreciate your thoughts, thank you very much.", "That's fair, but for the record its not like I didn't want to be there to support her. Like I said, I dropped everything including work in order to be by her side as soon as I heard. \n\nSince I don't live in my home country, its tough for me to not seize an opportunity to see friends and family. And honestly after what happened to her brother it made me want to see them even more, made me realise that our time really isn't in our hands.", "Thank you for understanding and I'm so sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f", "if my best friend's sibling died **I myself** am flying back immediately. I guess I'm a better friend than OP?", "What? Her trip was scheduled for the day after he died. How or why would she be able to bring his ashes with her?", "Ooops Kate is Jen and Jack is Jon. My post was initially too long so I changed their names. All names are fake of course. Good catch!", "Hopefully it won't come to that, but regardless of anything, I do want to say that you sound like a really good person, especially since you're willing to take any and all blame just to move past this and the fact that you're willing to lose your friends if it means she doesn't lose hers.\n\nFor now though, just give it time. If your friends ask what's going on, tell them your side of things and let them decide for themselves. Maybe even send your friend a text letting her know you're thinking of her and to just let you know if she needs anything. I'm sure she's reading your messages, even if she's not responding.", "She had plenty of close family members to support her.", "Wooh, so she had more support that most of us would have in that situation.  Sorry, but life happens to people, you did what you could.  NTA.", "I hear you. I should have said, \u201cwhat she perceives as your defensiveness\u201d.

You will likely get other chances to see your family (even if not as frequent as you\u2019d like) but your best friend only has one funeral for her brother.

Maybe a part which wasn\u2019t required for the murder inquiry.", "Thank you for your kind words. I do love her very much and I would never do anything to hurt her on purpose. I'm willing to do anything for our friendship to survive this but if thats not what she wants, I will learn to understand and live with that. \n\nLike you said, I hope it doesn't come to that. I like your suggestion, I was planning to visit her brother tomorrow so I will ask her today if she would like to come with me again and hopefully she responds. \n\nThank you, kind stranger!", "I was there to support her when I could. I was one of the first few to arrive when we had heard the news in the morning and I stayed until the very end. I was the last person to leave, I remember getting home just after midnight. But you're right, to her I guess that wasn't enough and I did express that to her and apologised for that too but I understand how an apology doesn't make it better. \n\nThe last time I saw our friends and family we went to visit was in 2016 so after 7 years I really didn't want to throw that chance away. It was hard enough for us to organise a date and time to accommodate everyone's busy schedules so I also didn't want to be disrespectful of the time and effort they made for us. My mom had also recently lost 2 of her friends in the past few months so she was adamant to see everyone while she still could and I didn't want to take that from her. If it were a holiday that didn't affect anyone else but me, I would have stayed in a heartbeat and I told Jen that too. \n\nI know it is the bare minimum but not all of our friends did that for her so I guess its not. In fairness some did come after work which was great but 2 of our other friends were abroad at the time and I don't think she expected either of them to book flights home before their expected return date.", "\u2764\ufe0f", "YTA but not because you went on the trip. I couldn't fathom doing that if my best friend lost her brother, but I appreciate it felt out of your control. My issue is  trying to justify it and give excuses when you finally talked about it with her. You just need to say \"I'm really sorry my decision hurt you. What can I do to help now that I'm home?\" And, if that isn't good enough, just give her some time to cool off. \n\nBeing defensive and making the conversation continue to the point where you're listing reasons why it's okay, including using her brother as a reason for seeing your own family, isn't what she needs and isn't kind. Grief has permeated her entire life, and she just needs you to be wrong (you are as far as she's concerned) and be okay with being wrong. There's nothing you can say to justify it to her, and trying to excuse it is ah behavior this soon after the loss.\n\nIt'll be okay. Just try to be compassionate and present in her life to make up for it. I'd be baking some lasagnas for her freezer if I were you.", "If your plans involved breaking a commitment to tons of family and friends you haven't seen in over 7 years and probably won't see for the same time frame, would you still cancel? \n\nIf your plans involved disappointing your mom and letting her pre-planned annual leave go down the drain would you still cancel?\n\nIf your plans cost you thousands that you would never get back would you still cancel? \n\nEven if you were there for your friend for as long as you could before going away and offerred support even from abroad, would you still cancel? \n\nYour answer may still be yes but how do you think everyone you broke your commitment to would have felt after cancelling at such last minute? Ultimately I stand by my decision to go but I appreciate your answer, I guess we are all different.", "Refuse to let it split the group. Your answer to everything is that, no, you will not argue or fight. \n- She is grieving, and she will keep on grieving for a very long time.\n- I did something that hurt her. Even though it wasn't done to her on purpose, and I couldn't find another way around it, it still hurt her.\n- She will blame me and I won't fight it because she is in a pain like nothing else and she's striking out.\n- She's hitting out at me because it's safe to do to me - because she knows I love her and won't give up on her. \n- I don't want to lose her, so I will be calm and wait.\n- And when she's ready and wants me I'll be there. \n\nHang in there OP. I hope she'll be able to come back to you soon. Then you can grieve together. \n\nAnd you'll be able to explain your panic at realising that people can be lost 'just like that' and your need to touch base with your family. But wait a while for that - like a year.", "Honestly, if you didn't see them for 7 years, it was your choice. Unless you didn't have residency rights and/or is a refugee and just now had the right to return to your home country. But that doesn't mean you couldn't fly in 6 or 12 months again.\nMy husband's family live far away, and because of residency issues, he couldn't visit them for 7 years and missed some important funerals. But now that he can, he or we have been back every year. We don't earn much, but we prioritize this.\nYou asked for a judgment, not for backup. We read your post. If you don't like to add more guilt, don't come and post here.\nAnd depending on the culture, people wouldn't be disappointed canceling last minutes. In my husband's culture you are not allowed to party or go on a holiday or anything fun for a looong time after somebody died, even old people.\nI can see the dilemma, but I'm not sure the travel was worth destroying your friendship for.", "I don't think I have anyone in my life that wouldn't understand me flaking on a special occasion to be with my best friend in this situation. I only have 1 best friend, and the hierarchy of importance in my life is #1 me, #2 significant other, #3 best friend, #4 immediate family.\n\nI don't think I would even enjoy the trip with the shadow hanging over me, it would sour the experience.", "When my mom died on a Tuesday, my bff, who was a teacher (so not rich), flew out from Asia to the US to be at her memorial service on Friday. She stayed for 5 days (the max she could cuz of work) and flew back. It meant the world to me. After the whirlwind of people that the funeral brings, for a few days she was there to support me through vacuum of noise and people that happens after they all leave. She was there to let me talk about my mom, cry about her, and just sit in grief\u2026 and make me laugh about stupid stuff\u2026 It showed me that she would always be there for me\u2026 That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been bffs for decades. \n\nIt seems you couldn\u2019t even stay for the funeral. You\u2019ve probably never lost a closely loved family member or you\u2019d understand how much support she needs. \n\nThis will probably be a turning point in your friendship. She\u2019s learned that you probably won\u2019t be there for her when she needs you the most. A friend of mine lost his sister when he was 20. He said he lost a lot of friends at that time, but learned who his real friends were because they supported him. \n\nYou can defend your choice and all your reasons are excuses. You were there for one day\u2026 and then gone. You didn\u2019t even check in daily. Your apologies seem hollow when they\u2019re followed with you defending your choices. Your actions speak louder than your words. YTA."]}
