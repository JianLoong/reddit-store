I apologised till I was blue in the face but to no avail so I defended my decision to go, explaining we went to see our loved ones and that I didn't think it was fair on my mom and the people we were visiting to cancel last minute. I said that it would have been a waste of my moms holidays at work and the money she had already spent. My mom doesn't have the option of cancelling her days off and our flights were non-refundable. My mom would have refused to go without me as well. I also explained that since we don't live with family its essential for us to travel to see them.\n\nJen didn't like how my message was defensive and we got into an argument.

Yes, everything about this situation sucks, but you had a lot of reasons for why you couldn't just cancel your trip. Your friend may keep giving you the silent treatment for a while, but hopefully she'll come around. But please stop blaming yourself. This situation is not your fault.", "NTA, and bordering on N A H, as grief is likely interfering with Jen's ability to see this situation clearly. She's likely not really coping right now and has your absence confused with the actual problem, which your presence couldn't solve. I'm hoping that once you're home you can talk it out with her and she will backtrack from saying you were wrong to miss out on a rare chance to see your family.", "NTA - you did what you could to support her, and presumably she has family with her.\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t call your activity a \u201cvacation \u201c.  You were \u201cvisiting family\u201d, which is an important distinction.  \n\nAlso, how long have you been best friends with Jen?", "NTA, but where you went wrong was apologising beyond necessity until you tipped into defensiveness. Jen is a raw nerve and isn\u2019t in her right mind, and you are an easy focus of anger and upset after the tragedy of losing her brother suddenly. Being \u201cthere\u201d for her, in more ways than physically with her, and apologising less but perhaps giving her loving space is what she needs now?\n\nI would, however, apologise for your defensiveness.", "NTA These things can bring up a lot of overwhelming emotions and you were empathetic but ultimately tried to communicate what you needed to do.", "NAH, but also don\u2019t be surprised if this isn\u2019t something Jen can move beyond. Just give her space and be there if she does decide she has capacity to address her feelings with you, she has a lot to navigate right now. \n\nGrief is a funny thing, and everyone responds to it differently. Jen needed her best friend, and you couldn\u2019t be there despite wanting to support her (and I am sure loving her very much). It\u2019s likely that your absence has given her something tangible to direct her energy into, and that hurt can feel empowering when turned into anger. \n\nI hope you can both work this out, sending you my thoughts!", "NAH, it sounds like a really tough situation, and while you had genuine reasons for going on the holiday, Jen is understandably going through a lot and needs support.", "NTA.  Loss can make people act out.", "NTA. Just give her some time and make sure she knows that you will be there for her when she needs it. The timing of the holiday is unfortunate but you made the decision you thought was right and that\u2019s that. Stop apologising and give her some space to process things and get the funeral out of the way.", "NAH I guess but I couldn\u2019t fathom going on a holiday (even to see family) a day after my best friends sibling died and then not being there to support her during the funeral.", "if my best friend's sibling died I'm cancelling my plans\n\nYTA", "NTA at all, my best friend was on holiday when my dad passed and not once did i expect them to immediately fly back to comfort me.

It is true that she isn't a priority to you, but you are free to decide that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I apologised till I was blue in the face\" .. Sorry, but you just are not THAT important. - That IS quite a harsh satement.

Your relationship is unlikely to survive that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut no AH, because you are fine to priorize your holiday over being there for your so called \"best friend\".", "YTA, your best friend needed you but you weren't there for her. I get it, traveling can be expensive and everything was booked in advance. It's important to see family and your mother was relying on you to be a travel companion. But your best friend's life was ripped apart by the death of a younger sibling.  \n\nYou can travel any time or if that's not financially viable, at another point in the future. Your friend really needed you this one time and you've shown her that a holiday is more important than them. That you can not be relied on during a time of need. It is unfathomable to me that to think that I would abandon my best friend while they were going through something like this.  \n\nPeople on Reddit will validate your decision because a large percentage of people online think that you don't owe anyone anything. This is a poor take, real life doesn't work like that. Sometimes life puts us in unfair situations and we need to make a choice, you chose poorly here. Don't be surprised if your friendship is unsalvageable, but I do hope you're able to work it out.", "Thank you, I appreciate that. The thought of her not thinking clearly did cross my mind so I dropped the whole argument, I offered to take 101% of the blame just so we could move past it. I'm not too worried about her giving me the silent treatment, she probably just has a lot on her mind and replying to me is not a priority. \n\nI'm just worried about what this will do to our shared friend group, I hope the time doesn't come when they're forced to take sides. Honestly I'd prefer for them to take her side. I can't imagine losing my friends after losing a brother.", "Actually during our argument I mentioned that perhaps she was misdirecting her feelings on the situation as anger towards me and she was not so happy about that. She accused me of putting her in a cliche box by putting the blame on me just to fit my narrative. \n\nShe also accused me of guilting her by telling her we don't have the liberty of seeing family and travelling is essential for us to do this. Obviously that fact is true but I never said it to guilt her, I was merely stating a fact.\n\nI hope she even gives me the chance to talk to her at this point.", "She does have family with her. She has 2 other siblings and both her parents, not including extended family like aunts, uncles, cousins, grandmother etc. \n\nHer SO, who is also my best friend was by her side the whole time too. I also asked my boyfriend to attend the funeral so he could offer support while I was away. \n\nWe've been friends since high school, about 12 years now.", "Apart from apologising, I didn't know what else to do. I didn't think I was being defensive, I honestly just explained my reasons for going, but I get that from her pov it was just an excuse which she deemed defensive. \n\nI, however, have already apologised to her about being defensive but again to no avail. I've also been giving her space. I just hope she comes around eventually.", "Thank you, that makes me feel a bit better. I just hope she forgives me eventually", "I hope it doesn't come to that but I'm prepared to accept if she doesn't move beyond it. \n\nI appreciate your thoughts, thank you very much.", "That's fair, but for the record its not like I didn't want to be there to support her. Like I said, I dropped everything including work in order to be by her side as soon as I heard. \n\nSince I don't live in my home country, its tough for me to not seize an opportunity to see friends and family. And honestly after what happened to her brother it made me want to see them even more, made me realise that our time really isn't in our hands.", "Thank you for understanding and I'm so sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f", "if my best friend's sibling died **I myself** am flying back immediately. I guess I'm a better friend than OP?", "What? Her trip was scheduled for the day after he died. How or why would she be able to bring his ashes with her?", "Ooops Kate is Jen and Jack is Jon. My post was initially too long so I changed their names. All names are fake of course. Good catch!", "Hopefully it won't come to that, but regardless of anything, I do want to say that you sound like a really good person, especially since you're willing to take any and all blame just to move past this and the fact that you're willing to lose your friends if it means she doesn't lose hers.\n\nFor now though, just give it time. If your friends ask what's going on, tell them your side of things and let them decide for themselves. Maybe even send your friend a text letting her know you're thinking of her and to just let you know if she needs anything. I'm sure she's reading your messages, even if she's not responding.", "She had plenty of close family members to support her.", "Wooh, so she had more support that most of us would have in that situation.  Sorry, but life happens to people, you did what you could.  NTA.", "I hear you. I should have said, \u201cwhat she perceives as your defensiveness\u201d. Anything other than her pain probably feels like \u201cdefensiveness\u201d to her. \n\n\nI am sure she will, and it sounds like you have a big heart and will put this behind you \u2665\ufe0f", "I do get that, but from your friends perspective, her brother passing away is a once in a lifetime tragedy and her best friend wasn\u2019t present to support her during one of the hardest days of her life. You will likely get other chances to see your family (even if not as frequent as you\u2019d like) but your best friend only has one funeral for her brother. Missing work when your best friends sibling dies is what I\u2019d hope the bare minimum for what any best friend would do.", "thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "not at all, everyone\u2019s situation is different, it doesn\u2019t make you a better person", "Could have cremated just a bit of him ahead of time. Maybe a part which wasn\u2019t required for the murder inquiry.", "Thank you for your kind words. I do love her very much and I would never do anything to hurt her on purpose. I'm willing to do anything for our friendship to survive this but if thats not what she wants, I will learn to understand and live with that. \n\nLike you said, I hope it doesn't come to that. I like your suggestion, I was planning to visit her brother tomorrow so I will ask her today if she would like to come with me again and hopefully she responds. \n\nThank you, kind stranger!", "I was there to support her when I could. I was one of the first few to arrive when we had heard the news in the morning and I stayed until the very end. I was the last person to leave, I remember getting home just after midnight. But you're right, to her I guess that wasn't enough and I did express that to her and apologised for that too but I understand how an apology doesn't make it better. \n\nThe last time I saw our friends and family we went to visit was in 2016 so after 7 years I really didn't want to throw that chance away. It was hard enough for us to organise a date and time to accommodate everyone's busy schedules so I also didn't want to be disrespectful of the time and effort they made for us. My mom had also recently lost 2 of her friends in the past few months so she was adamant to see everyone while she still could and I didn't want to take that from her. If it were a holiday that didn't affect anyone else but me, I would have stayed in a heartbeat and I told Jen that too. \n\nI know it is the bare minimum but not all of our friends did that for her so I guess its not. In fairness some did come after work which was great but 2 of our other friends were abroad at the time and I don't think she expected either of them to book flights home before their expected return date.", "\u2764\ufe0f"]}
