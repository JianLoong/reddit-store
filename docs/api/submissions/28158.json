We don't have assigned seating in this class but for the most part people gravitate to the same seats.\n\nThe guy who sits next to me has a habit of eating sandwiches during class. I won't lie that it bothers me but because our entire class is full I don't have the option of moving seats this late into the semester. He usually eats it within ten minutes though so it's not that big of a problem.\n\nToday in class he pulled out his usual sandwich and I started to cough. I could faintly smell peanut butter so I asked him if that's what he was eating. He said he was and I excused myself quickly otherwise I would go into anaphylaxis. I texted a friend inside to grab my things so I wouldn't have to go back in and left class for the day. I emailed my professor letting her know that I needed access to the slides because I had to leave early due to the peanut butter sandwich.\n\nMy professor sent out a Canvas announcement that food was no longer allowed during class due to an incident (everyone saw me cough and then leave) and now I've gotten texts saying it wasn't fair that my health caused a ban on everything. I emailed my professor letting her know and she said she was going to keep the ban because she didn't like the snacking in class anyways. I feel really bad because I didn't expect it to escalate like this and I am contemplating staying home from class for the week because everyone knows it's my fault. Am I the Asshole?\n\nEdit: I've been getting a lot of comments that I wasn't going to go into anaphylaxis. My doctor advised me to stay away from it altogether because of the severity of the allergy. I didn't want to take any chances which is why I left. I usually do get nauseous with the smell of nuts (not sure if that is allergy related) but I will get in touch with my professor and see if I can just move seats instead.", "created_utc": 1696361109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16z0xwi/aita_for_causing_a_classwide_food_ban/", "score": 1403, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From pre-k through 12th grade, we had a kid in my class who had a life threatening, *airborne* peanut allergy. And this started in the early 90s, before widespread banning of foods was really common. \n\nThere were a bunch of kids and parents who were pissed that they couldn't send their kids to school with PBJ, and every single one was told, \"you're complaining about not being able to make a particular sandwich, this kid is asking you to please not kill him. Get over it.\"\n\nI think around 1st grade (so 3 years of this) some entitled parent decided he was faking, and sent their kid in with a PBJ. Trae lasted about a minute before the coughing started, and maybe two minutes after that, he started going into true anaphylaxis. He had an EpiPen on him, and everyone in class knew how to use it (\"just in case\"). \n\nHe was rushed to the ER, and though he ended up being fine, it was scary for all us 6yos. We became hyper-vigilant about all things PB, because suddenly that shit was REAL for us now.\n\nGood job for recognizing the signs your body was giving you that it was in distress. Yes, you were not in anaphylaxis *at the moment you left the room*, but the goal is always to prevent that from happening, not waiting until your life is actively in danger and you are in the process of dying. \n\nYou did the right thing by leaving and doing what you needed to protect yourself. You didn't ask for a PB ban (which you would have been within your rights to do), nor did you ask for a snack ban. \n\nThe professor made a choice about what was allowed in their classroom, with the aim of keeping all students safe and focused on the lesson. \n\nIf anyone gives you crap for it, tell them to either take it up with the Prof, or go kick rocks. The ban was the prof's idea, and you're not going to apologize for taking steps to ensure you stayed alive.\n\nEdit: wow, thanks for all the upvotes, y'all", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ask for food to be banned, you simply asked for slides. Your professor used that incident as the final straw for banning food in her classroom, which is her prerogative.", "NTA. \n\nAnaphylaxis WILL kill you without medical intervention. To anyone who is blaming you, ask them if they\u2019d be okay with that. \n\nYou can\u2019t help what you\u2019re allergic to.", "NTA.\n\nWhen I was in grad school one of my classmates had a life threatening nut allergy. A student brought a type of Christmas nut as a present for the class from their home country's traditions. \n\nThe nut allergy student went to the hospital.\n\nThe reality is, people have major allergies to nuts, and nuts are in a lot of things. It seems extreme to ban all food, but given that students can be careless (ie bringing a bar that has peanuts as an ingredient) I can understand why a teacher would make that call for liability reasons. In any case, your having an allergy is not your fault.", "Don't bring peanut butter to enclosed places.  GenX here.  I've come to accept that my desire for peanut  butter does not mean I should place the health of my coworkers are risk when we're working in closed spaces for hours on end in a production control room.\n\nThe same holds true for classrooms, and you're reinforcing why it's important.\n\nDon't feel bad.  Dude should not have brought peanut butter to a class room.   NTA", "NTA. Anyone who texts you anything but \u201cAre you okay?\u201d  is an AH. \n\nEating in class caused a life threatening situation for you and it made the professor realize she didn\u2019t want to be the food police, and she now has a very good reason to ban food. Also, it probably scared her slightly to think a student could\u2019ve died.\n\nText back \u201cI\u2019m sorry my life threatening situation has inconvenienced you\u201d to the AHs. \n\nEdit:spelling", "NTA, you asked for the slides.\n\nThe professor just used this to ban the food she was already annoyed with. Eating should be done during breaks and not during lectures.", "NTA , at my work site, we have someone who's deathly allergic to anything nuts,so my boss put a ban on anything with nuts or even traces.\nAm i pissed ? Yeah ofc, i like to snack on nuts, but i prefer having my colleague alive, that's way more important imho.", "NTA. Snacking in class can be distracting to other students besides causing allergy flare-ups. It\\`s good to have it banned; if someone wants to snack, they can use their break to do so.\n\nBesides, you didn\\`t mean for a snack-ban to happen and didn\\`t insinuate it.", "NTA\n\nYour allergy isn't your fault. Also I can tell some folks have no idea what anaphylaxis can look like. I genuinely had a student whose only sign was feeling like being on the verge of a panic attack. And then it would hit HARD. She had a trach scar at 15. Do not mess around with allergies.", "NTA - some allergies really are that severe. You didn't cause it, you can't help it. Your professor was already bothered by the snacking.", "Totally NTA.... but if many people are eating in class, don't expect to be popular.  There's nothing you can do about that.", "NTA\n\n  \nYour classmates are, though, for blaming you for something the teacher did.  But that's college for you, the new high school it's seeming.", "NTA. What some people fail to realize is that if you can smell something, you are taking molecules of it into your body. I have a shellfish allergy and once had to leave a restaurant because we were seated near the kitchen door and they were doing special shellfish boils that night. The steam was coming out through the door, I could smell it, and my throat started to close up.", "NTA, as for the nausea it is your body protecting you.  I am allergic to a certain berries.  Even the artificial flavors in things like candy, soft drinks and Jello make me gag and vomit.", "NTA\n\nnot only was it a danger to you but it is disrespectful to be eating in class anyway", "NTA. And I'll just add that you will never be the asshole for taking reasonable efforts to ensure you get to see tomorrow.", "Some colleges will put your class in a peanut free room if you tell them before classes start. I know that isn\u2019t a help for this semester but it could help for next semester. \n\nAlso all the people saying you weren\u2019t about to have anaphylaxis are the asshole. I\u2019ve had anaphylaxis 4 times this year (the allergy became an anaphylaxis level allergy this year). The third time I was told by a nurse I couldn\u2019t have had anaphylaxis and wasted my epi. The fourth time I didn\u2019t take my epi until it was nearly too late. I stopped breathing and wasn\u2019t breathing for about 2 minutes before the epi kicked in. Anaphylaxis is serious af and people need to stop acting like it is something to play around with.", "NTA. I love peanut butter but if I\u2019m bringing a snack to class, I\u2019d never bring anything that has nuts. Anaphylaxis is serious.", "You did literally nothing. You didn't ask for the food ban. Explaining why you left isn't the same as asking for the food restriction. NTA on your part. Your prof was a bit of an AH by letting you catch the static. I totally understand why she doesn't want people eating in class, and I think it is reasonable that a professor does not want that going on. But she should have simply said that she doesn't want eating in class, not that it is because of you.", "NTA but I'm surprised that so many are against eating in class. Post secondary schedules are not like high school.", "NTA but the professor kind of is because they singled you out as the reason for instituting the ban when it was their own idea based on what they had wanted all along. \n\nNow you'll be the scapegoat when you were just trying to get away from something that could cause a reaction.", "NTA - You didn't ban the food, your professor did.\n\nAlso, I know of people's allergies that are so severe that if they are in the same ROOM with the allergen they immediately start to go into anaphylactic shock, so that was an actual possibility. Your nausea and coughing are early signs of the allergen entering your system", "NTA \n\nI had a girl in high school who\u2019s boyfriend thought it would be funny to eat a PB sandwich and blow the frigging air at her after chewing and she ended up in an ambulance. There are such things as a reaction to a peanut allergy if you are close enough and your health is not their problem but also they could have some empathy it\u2019s not like you choose to be allergic.", "NTA. Allergies are no joke! I don\u2019t have any, personally, but I have met a lot of people who do. It\u2019s really easy for people who don\u2019t have to worry to think someone is just making a big deal. It isn\u2019t nearly a big enough deal, though! People take for granted that they aren\u2019t walking through a minefield every time they look at a grocery store shelf or eat at a restaurant.  Unfortunately, sharing space with people who don\u2019t take your allergy seriously can make every person in that space a potentially deadly liability. \n\nI think your action of leaving and informing the professor was perfectly reasonable. A food ban is a reasonable and equitable response, even if it wasn\u2019t an express mandate before this incident.  I think school campuses having designated food-free areas is to be expected (even just because of sanitation concerns). \n\nI\u2019m sorry people are being jerks to you. You are entitled to existing in a public space without your life being threatened, and you shouldn\u2019t have to compromise your education in order to preserve your health. Please consider talking to your professor about how you\u2019re feeling, especially if you are concerned that you will be entering a hostile environment because of your peers. Public schools and universities have a student rights and responsibilities document that may be useful for you to reference in this scenario.\n\nYou absolutely do not have to disclose your personal health information or explain yourself to people. But if you are comfortable with it and feel it might help, it could be beneficial to educate your classmates about the reality of food allergies. At the very least, it might help them appreciate that they don\u2019t have to worry about getting merc\u2019d by a peanut.", "Nta. It could kill you.  Please don't skip class unless you can attend virtually your paying good money to go", "NTA - eating in class should never have been allowed in the first place.  Anybody who wants to whine about fairness should understand it's not fair you have a severe allergy and now they know life is not now, never has been or will be fair. Good they learn this lesson now.", "NTA. I know someone who would have gone into full anaphylaxis from that. Allergies can (and has) killed people. Your \"incident\" was just the example and proof the professor needed to set a rule that should have been there from day 1. Don\u00b4t try to let this health risk pass to please entitled students. \n\nAnyone who blames you are entitled a-holes. They *want* to eat during class, but most people don\u00b4t *need* to. If they do need to (low blood sugar for example), they can go outside the classroom.", "You are NTA. However, your teacher is. They should have specified \"no peanuts in class\" (reasonable accommodation to make), but \"no food\" sucks imo.  Like, chocolates are the only reason I'm still awake in class most of the time.", "NTA\n\nDo you have an EpiPen? Then this is a life threatening allergy.\nHave you been evaluated for severity by an allergist? If not you should be.\n\nThe professor didn't think that had to make a rule.\nThis isn't second grade.", "NTA. Nobody here knows you weren't going to go into anaphylaxis. Coughing is a bad sign! Anyway, hold your head up and go to class. You did nothing wrong. You only took care of yourself. It was the prof who made the decision, and that decision was the right one. You have a right to be educated without being exposed to allergens.", "NTA. The thing about allergies is that repeated exposure to the allergen can sometimes make them worse. Even if you weren\u2019t in danger this time, if it continues you could eventually get to the point where you DO go into anaphylactic shock if someone tries eating a peanut butter sandwich near you.\n\nBesides, you didn\u2019t know how bad it would\u2019ve gotten if you\u2019d stayed. You would\u2019ve been playing with your life if you hadn\u2019t left.", "I did lunch duty at my kids school, want to know how many parents thought the allergic child should be isolated from the others and made to eat lunch all alone so their little prince/princess could have their pb&j? Peanut butter isn\u2019t a human rights issue, make a different sandwich.", "Nta I also have an air borne peanut allergy and while you\u2019re Nta people will still suck and be awful to you for no reason. \n\nYay allergies.", "NTA at all, an Epi Pen can\u2019t always save you in an Anaphylaxis situation, so a class ban is appropriate. The people texting you need to educate themselves further.", "My son is in 1st grade and a kid in his class has a severe allergy to ALL nuts. The only sandwich my pick eater will eat is PBJ. I can\u2019t sub almond butter due to the allergy and sunflower butter is $7 for a tiny jar. I still put that kid\u2019s allergies ahead of my son\u2019s comfort. I send him some extra protein (usually yogurt) and extra fruit, etc so he has something to eat. I\u2019m not going to endanger another kid\u2019s life because mine is picky about sandwiches.", "NTA. If anyone brings it up with you \"I didn't ask the prof to ban food. I just left so I wouldn't have an allergic reaction, so that my allergy would only disturb my learning and not yours. Do you think the prof was likely to *not* ban food in class had I stayed and gotten anaphylactic shock and needed to stop class for everyone while the prof had to call an ambulance?\"", "NTA people will survive their 2hr-ish lecture without peanut butter. Don\u2019t risk yourself.", "Oh god, I made the mistake of sorting by controversial and now I have no faith left in humanity. OP, NTA. Everyone who thinks otherwise, and especially the people saying that airborne allergies don\u2019t exist, you completely suck.", "NTA, no, you shouldn't feel remotely bad.  This is the other kid's fault, he shouldn't be eating in class in the first place... and it's not about your allergy really.  Yes, someone with an allergy could be endangered or disadvantaged because of him eating, but it's an annoyance and a distraction to EVERYONE.\n\nDon't let this keep you out of class where you deserve to be as much as anyone else.", "NTA It's a serious having a peanut allergy. I'm surprised they allow eating in class we weren't no matter what the situation or time of day.", "How dare you...take steps to keep from dying. \n\nFood allergies are not something to take lightly. If a student needs to eat at that hour, they can do it before class. NTA.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ban food, the professor did. I do think the professor is being ridiculous by banning all food, though. College is extremely busy and has weird hours, and you have to eat sometime.", "NTA and it isn\u2019t your fault whatsoever", "It\u2019s not a damn cafeteria. What is wrong with your classmates? They can\u2019t get thru a class without snacks? Is this college or kindergarten?

That\u2019s not a negotiation. You should not have your health put at risk so someone can eat in class. \n\nStudents probably aren\u2019t supposed to eat in class (for this very reason).", "Nta", "NTA the other people complaining to you are assholes, you just wanted to go to class like everyone else", "NTA.  I understand feeling bad about it, especially given it\u2019s something you don\u2019t have any control over.  You can\u2019t control your allergies, and you can\u2019t control your professor\u2019s choice in the matter.  If you want, you could approach the classmate in question and strike up a conversation to let them know you didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.  I doubt they knew what they were doing would cause your allergies to act up.  That\u2019s also completely up to you if you want to approach them about it, but I also think they probably got the message, and they probably feel bad about it too if they are a decent person.  I would feel bad if I knew I caused someone to miss out on a class they paid for by causing them to have an allergic reaction.", "NTA. And don't let their harassment keep you from your education. You deserve to learn and if they make it hostile, speak to the dean.", "NTA, not your fault.", "ultimately it's up to the prof and she made the decision even after you appealed to her not to.  continue to be outwardly mortified that it escalated to this and apologize to anyone who complains... but show them the text with your prof.  then when you're all alone, smile a big smile and take the W.  sometimes wishes do come true.\n\nNTA", "NTA, airborne peanut allergy is real and the nausea you feel with the smell of nuts absolutely is allergy related. Nausea is a sign of allergy and is often a precursor to a full anaphylactic reaction. I\u2019ve done the anaphylaxis training twice a year for the last ten years and if an anaphylactic kid started complaining of nausea and coughing, I\u2019d have the EpiPen ready. \n\nYou did the right thing by leaving and informing the professor and he made the choice which would ensure safety for all students. Old mate isn\u2019t going to drop dead if he doesn\u2019t eat a peanut butter sandwich but you very well might if exposed to an allergen. I\u2019ve taught kids with diabetes who absolutely had to eat according to a given schedule and at no point did their diabetes infringe on the safety of the anaphylactic kids, so he hasn\u2019t got a leg to stand on.", "NTA - but don't stay home from class.

It's natural to minimize your condition when you're afraid it is making you a social outcast, but you have a serious peanut allergy. Your teacher didn't need to pick the nuclear option, but it's not on you that they did. Your classmates are understandably upset, but they are blaming the wrong person. IMO the teacher is an asshole for using you as an excuse to make a very unpopular rule change, knowing it will reflect poorly on you instead of her.", "You have nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed by. You sat through lots of sandwiches in the past and didn't make a stink about people eating, so obviously you had nothing to do with banning *food,* and the prof was simply leaping on the opportunity. \n\nThe professor IS under an obligation to make their class accessible to their students, or what's the point of paying tuition. So the professor *should* take action to make their classroom a safe and comfortable space for everyone. It's not conducive to learning to hear crinkling wrappers, smelling food smells, and other distractions that food inherently brings. It's not you at all.\n\nThe people who are \"blaming\" you are not thinking clearly or thoroughly about this issue. Unfortunately, people like that also tend to be the loudest.
