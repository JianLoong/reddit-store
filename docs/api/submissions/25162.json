He needs to have your back and not his Mummy\u2019s.", "NTA. Life lesson for anyone, if a mother wants her baby handed back, and it is not also your baby, you hand the baby back.", "NTA, your MIL is.  Your husband should have stood up for you and now you should backtrack with your in laws since they can\u2019t respect your boundaries.  She overstepped and now I wouldn\u2019t be taking the baby anywhere near them.", "I say NTA, but I might be bias because I\u2019ve been in a very similar situation with my MIL and because i also had bad postpartum anxiety. Trying to set boundaries with family around our little one has been so difficult. Especially when how we do things is different from how they did things with their children or is different from how they imagined things would be with a grandchild. I say stick to your boundaries and what you feel is right for you as a mother. The more you bend to their push back, the more they will continue walking over your boundaries. (Also, if someone told me they wouldn\u2019t give me back my crying child, the momma bear in me might rip their face off.)", "NTA. As soon as you asked for that baby back you should have been handed your child!", "NTA. \n\nAll of those boundaries you set seem perfectly reasonable to me. There's not a single thing off, or overdoing it. All fine. \n\nPersonally, I would go \"no personal contact\" with MIL. Including the baby. For as long as she needs to realize what she did wrong. Her behaviour was EXTREMELY disrespectful, to the point of belittling you passive aggressively; basically implying you are unable to parent the child correctly.", "NTA. I'm not a mother yet the very idea of someone telling me \"I won't give you your baby back\" is making my blood boil.", "NTA. But your MIL is. She literally tried to move your hands so she could grab the baby out of your hands? Your MIL got a few simple rules and even that she can't follow. Your husband is also an asshole for not standing up for you.", "NTA. It seems like you have set healthy boundaries and are not baring MIL from contact or even holding the baby.\n\nYour MIL has to understand it's not her baby.\nYour husband should have your back on this, not his mom.", "NTA you are a first time mom trying to navigate being a parent, getting to know your baby and take care of your self at the same time. It\u2019s a lot and you have every right to put up what ever boundaries you need. Your MIL was out of line. I can sympathise whit her to a certain extent, it\u2019s her grandchild and she wants to bond. But that does not excuse her behaviour.", "NTA, \n\nMIL and Hubby are for sure.\n\nHubby less so, he's probably just frustrated and getting pressure from his mum, he may not actually agree with what she did, if he does then he's a full a hole.\n\nMIL should know better having had her own children and is the definition of monster in law.\n\nLimit contact until she can stick to your boundaries, and try keep it on your turf too i.e at your home.", "NTA - your baby, your rules for how things go down.\n\n At the same time, it's very natural for wider family to want to build a connection with your baby too. I could see how from their perspective they might feel frustrated but they should still respect your wishes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
