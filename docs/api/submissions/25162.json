Life lesson for anyone, if a mother wants her baby handed back, and it is not also your baby, you hand the baby back.", "NTA, your MIL is.  Your husband should have stood up for you and now you should backtrack with your in laws since they can\u2019t respect your boundaries.  She overstepped and now I wouldn\u2019t be taking the baby anywhere near them.", "I say NTA, but I might be bias because I\u2019ve been in a very similar situation with my MIL and because i also had bad postpartum anxiety. Trying to set boundaries with family around our little one has been so difficult. Especially when how we do things is different from how they did things with their children or is different from how they imagined things would be with a grandchild. I say stick to your boundaries and what you feel is right for you as a mother. The more you bend to their push back, the more they will continue walking over your boundaries. (Also, if someone told me they wouldn\u2019t give me back my crying child, the momma bear in me might rip their face off.)", "NTA. As soon as you asked for that baby back you should have been handed your child!", "NTA. \n\nAll of those boundaries you set seem perfectly reasonable to me. There's not a single thing off, or overdoing it. All fine. \n\nPersonally, I would go \"no personal contact\" with MIL. Including the baby. For as long as she needs to realize what she did wrong. Her behaviour was EXTREMELY disrespectful, to the point of belittling you passive aggressively; basically implying you are unable to parent the child correctly.", "NTA. I'm not a mother yet the very idea of someone telling me \"I won't give you your baby back\" is making my blood boil.", "NTA. But your MIL is. She literally tried to move your hands so she could grab the baby out of your hands? Your MIL got a few simple rules and even that she can't follow. Your husband is also an asshole for not standing up for you.", "NTA. It seems like you have set healthy boundaries and are not baring MIL from contact or even holding the baby.\n\nYour MIL has to understand it's not her baby.\nYour husband should have your back on this, not his mom.", "NTA you are a first time mom trying to navigate being a parent, getting to know your baby and take care of your self at the same time. It\u2019s a lot and you have every right to put up what ever boundaries you need. Your MIL was out of line. I can sympathise whit her to a certain extent, it\u2019s her grandchild and she wants to bond. But that does not excuse her behaviour.", "NTA, \n\nMIL and Hubby are for sure.\n\nHubby less so, he's probably just frustrated and getting pressure from his mum, he may not actually agree with what she did, if he does then he's a full a hole.\n\nMIL should know better having had her own children and is the definition of monster in law.\n\nLimit contact until she can stick to your boundaries, and try keep it on your turf too i.e at your home.", "NTA - your baby, your rules for how things go down.\n\n At the same time, it's very natural for wider family to want to build a connection with your baby too. I could see how from their perspective they might feel frustrated but they should still respect your wishes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She wants to feel involved, so is there a way that you can do that without your own boundaries being crossed?", "NTA You asked for your baby back, she should have obliged. Then you were trying to feed her and MIL was imposing herself. MIL was an AH.\n\nHowever, it's hard to make a clear analysis. You said that you're not in the right state of mind, so it's perfectly possible that what MIL did wasn't as harsh as you're making it sound. Especially because your husband is saying it was ok and that you have been overreacting over his mother.\n\nI'd like to know if you're getting professional help to deal with the anxiety as what you describe here is far from healthy.\n\nMaybe you could try to not be as strict. The baby cried while she was with MIL. Let MIL try to handle it and jump in if she can't. Grandparents like to also be able to calm their grandkids down. The feeling of being able to do it is awesome and if you don't let other people do it, it will bite you in the ass later as you won't be able to go anywhere as no one else will be capable of calming her down. You're setting yourself up for failure.", "You handled that incredibly well, I'd have punched her.", "NTA but you have a husband problem. He should be backing you up.", "NTA", "NTA. I would\u2019ve been furious. If a parent asks for their baby back, you give the baby back, period.", "This.

The first time you asked she should've given the baby back, especially not walked away.  That's when your husband needed to step up and say mom give the baby back (ps if this had happened, and trust built that when you asked for your child, you would be given said child, the anxiety could've lessened slightly).  Husband deciding to side with his mom... well he can also go live with her as well.", "NTA Your husband is stupid. Tell him to look up the definition of respect. ILs are the assholes here and husband has to put them in their place. Couples counseling would benefit both of you. You and hubby need to be on the same page in your dealings with them. \n\nYou have done nothing wrong OP, and are doing a fantastic job holding your own and mothering your child. ILs opinions do not matter and should be shut down immediately and consequences applied if they contrive, like going no contact or very low contact until they've learned to keep their worst impulses in check.\n\nYou will receive more support and encouragement from these two sub-reddits:\n\nr/JUSTNOMIL\nr/motherinlawsfromhell", "NTA I intentionally chose not to have children, but your mil refusing to give your baby back had me seething with rage in your behalf. Your mil is a piece of work. And your husband is too, for not defending you. He needs to get his priorities in order.", "Nta. Your baby needed feeding which you were trying to do. \n\nMils need to step back and stop trying to interfere all the time. Not all mils are like this.", "Your husband is an unsupportive dumbass.\n\nNTA \n\nMiL is overstepping her bounds and if husband can\u2019t support you then it\u2019s time to go low contact with his family until they learn to listen.\n\nIt was a red flag when they didn\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t leave the house for the first 1-2 months. Even pre-Covid you were supposed to stay home with the baby as much as possible for the first 6weeks! I don\u2019t know how that has been impacted post-Covid, if at all.", "NAH.\n\nYou've stated you're not in the best state of mind. I understand that. I also am not a mother and do not want to be, so I hope I don't offend you when I say this: Please work on yourself and accept help from people who want to help you. I'm assuming you're from the US, and here people tend to want to be the only ones handling the stress of raising a child, but it takes a village as they say. If you admit you're suffering with extra levels of anxiety, then you should be able to admit that maybe you overreact when you're experiencing it, and that having active grandparents is a good thing for everyone involved in your kids' life. I urge you to seek help and find ways to reduce your anxiety surrounding people being around your child, especially if those people are the grandparents.", "NTA \nShe needs to back off and your husband needs to support you.", "Someone tried something similar with my nephew once, the repeatedly trying to grab him and refusing to give him back thing. My brother almost laid them out, and my SIL would have if she hadn't still been recovering. That person is no longer in his or his parents life. No means No regardless of who you are. \n\nDear husband needs to realise that his mom doesn't outrank you, the childs actual mother, when it comes to parenting her.

You have a husband problem.  Was he always picking them over his wife/mother of his kid?  Or did this just start?\n\nTell him to either back you up or go back there so he can be with his mommy and daddy all day.  Hold firm to your parenting style.  And you can kick people out of your home if they're stressing you out, it's your house too.  Also, you don't have to go to events they invite you to.  If your husband is not defending you and pressuring you to give into whatever they want, you have a huge problem on your hands with him and it may need to be addressed in marital therapy.", "NTA.  Yep.  Another husband problem.  You husband should have your back.  You're dealing with a crying baby and your MIL is making it a hostage situation.  Having to take your baby to the car to feed her in peace is just unacceptable and your husband needs to manage the situation instead of catering to his overbearing mother.", "NTA, your MIL and your husband are out of the line but please seek for some help. I have a  3 months old baby and the most useful advise I've gotten those months is to take care of myself because a happy mama is a happy baby.", "literally, reading that made me SEETHE", "fr. i\u2019m sick of mil\u2019s behaviour and i\u2019ve known she exists for maybe 2 minutes. in laws need to back off, and hubby needs to back up his wife. they won\u2019t get better. when op gets less anxious, they\u2019ll take the excuse to push harder. and they\u2019re already pushing pretty damn hard. nta.", "That's an assault on OP.", "As a mother of two. It is very hard to allow someone to settle your baby when they dont respect your boundaries or as the parent. However when someone does respect you then it feels a lot easier to allow them.", "I so don\u2019t understand how someone hears that and doesn\u2019t leave. Me and my partner have a firm rule (we thankfully haven\u2019t needed yet) that if someone says that, we get baby back and we leave. They\u2019re barred from holding baby until we ask if they want to. If it happens again they\u2019re banned for life", "Exactly.  Not only would I leave, they would never hold my baby again.  Often times, new parents feel weird about setting boundaries.  But your baby needs you to be strong and stand up to people.  They cannot do it on their own.\n\nAnd if my husband didn't back me up, I would tell him to go back there and live with her.  I don't need someone in my life who won't put his wife first.", "That second part is bang on. I\u2019ve made it clear to my partner that I love him but my job is to protect my child and if that ever meant leaving him then I would"]}
