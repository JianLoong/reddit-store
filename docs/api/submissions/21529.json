You said you were \"shocked\" she never owned one. I dont think its as uncommon as you think for women not to own a vibrator or have an interest in using one.\n\nAs a person in a relationship, if someone gifted me a sex toy or gifted my partner a sex toy with the assumption that it was no doubt going to be a net positive, I would think that's creepy (why are you thinking about my sex life so much) and way out of bounds.\n\nAnd then I'd have to have a conversation with my SO about what the \"gifting dildos\" policy is in our relationship is.

If it will upset her partner, it follows that it will probably upset her as well. Why would you want to do that? You gave her your opinion, and she is an adult capable of purchasing one for herself if she wants to. Find a more appropriate gift.", "YWBTA\n\nGreat! You think they're amazing.  But, your friend has told you why she has never bought one - why would you risk their relationship just because you *think* you know what's good for them?\n\n> she told me she has never ever owned one.. Not something I have forgotten as it was a little shocking to me.\n\nI don't understand why you think this is shocking - I'm willing to bet there are millions of women in western countries that dont own or have never used a vibrator.", "If she wants one but wont because of her partner, i am gonna say you wouldnt be, but he is if he is preventing her trying it.\n\nIf her partner would have a problem with her over her friend giving her a gift she has no control over then your friend is better off without him.\n\nPersonally i think there is a chance it may work to open his mind a bit more to it, but i also dont know them maybe he is a huge dick and will lose his shit, idk i dont know him at all.\n\nPerhaps ask others who know them, or even ask your friend if she would be ok with it, people on the internet dont know them or you and what you are all like together ect so imo it isnt rly helpful in this situation.", "not a popular opinion but depending on how close i are i would say why not. if you\u2019re really close then yes, go for it. if you aren\u2019t v close then nah. vibrators are amazing and i gifted my friend one once (it was a harry styles one as a joke but still useable haha) but we were best friends. if u do get her one, explain your reasonings and possibly approve it w her before u buy it. i wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole but having a sex positive friend is an amazing luxury as i\u2019ve found out myself lol", "You see, the thing is it\u2019s a little odd. When and if she uses it, it will remind her of you. Ywbta", "YTA. Its fine to get her one. Not as a birthday gift where the chances of him asking \"hey, what did your best friend get you\" are high.

Baby boy needs to grow up, learn to love his partner. You could keep the gift as anonymous as possible if that would help.

That would give her the ability to select something she is comfortable with and have her partner participate, which will make him more accepting of the item.", "I think it\u2019s a sad situation. Her partner isn\u2019t prioritizing her pleasure and your friend opened up to you and made it clear she wanted one but doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s \u201callowed\u201d to have one. That\u2019s a huge red flag in my opinion. Pardon the language but his ideas of masculinity shouldn\u2019t be threatened by the fact she can pleasure herself as well, I\u2019m sure he jerks off. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to gift someone this as a birthday present. She\u2019s an adult and needs to work that problem out herself.", "YWBTA. Not appropriate. This is not your business.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s completely appropriate. If she says she wants one and KNOWS you\u2019d be getting her one it\u2019s different because then she might be prepared to tell her partner, but to randomly get one puts her in an awkward position because she\u2019s not prepared to talk about it and breach that subject.

The y-t-as are ignoring the glaringly obvious problem: the boyfriend. Hes TA, not you OP. Everyone deserves self pleasure if they want it (within legality of course), and everyone deserves better than a guy who\u2019s threatened by sex toys, your friend included. He needs to grow up or get gone. I do agree with comments suggesting that you get a gift card instead, unless you feel confident that your toy will check all her boxes \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No you wouldn't be TA.

She again had never used one, had been through a messy divorce and had two young children - she saw the funny side of it. We'd talked about them in the pub a few weeks before her birthday which was when we found out she'd never had one or used one before.\n\nBeing adults, we have open conversations about this sort of thing \ud83e\udd37 She didn't know what we had planned, and certainly wasn't expecting it when she opened the gift bag then very quickly closed it at her birthday tea party \ud83d\ude02\n\n(It was me (f) and two friends (both m) who clubbed together to buy a decent one for her)", "Voting NTA for personal reasons. I don't think it's weird. I used to date a girl who had a group of friends and for birthdays, they'd gift each other vibrators as gag gifts, no pun intended. So I don't find it creepy or weird to do it. However, I would think it's better to get her a gift card and let her pick something out for herself. I've been to those stores and it's like being in the cereal aisle at the grocery store. There's lot of options. Also, do this privately with just you and here there. Doing anything at a party is crossing a line.\n\nAlso, it's her body and her choice of how she wants to get off. I don't know why her partner is so threatened by it. It's no different than him pleasuring himself. It's not another guy pleasuring her, it's herself doing it. If he doesn't like it, that's that's him problem, not a her problem.", "YTA\n\nShe knows how to get one. Nothing is stopping her but what she thinks are important feelings her partner has shared with her - and likely wouldn\u2019t appreciate her having shared with you. Get your nose out of their bedroom business and remember that when a friend vents or shares with you they\u2019re looking for a supportive listener, not a line-crossing meddler. And if that\u2019s hard for you imagine the situation in reverse. A man buys your partner a toy to use even though they explicitly said it is something you\u2019re not comfortable with. See, pretty gross and semi-violating isn\u2019t it?\n\nYou also have zero idea if his apprehension and issues around feeling emasculated are related to bad experiences in his past, or even traumatic ones. That\u2019s not something I\u2019d share with a friend. \n\nStop trying to impose your values and feelings on someone else\u2019s sex life. If she asks for your help getting one or a recommendation *then* you can offer to buy her one.", "YWBTA. Even if her partner has the worst reasons, it's her relationship with him and she decides when and if to breach that issue. She's a grown woman and you can buy a vibrator at fucking Walmart now.

Even with your reasoning, she\u2019d likely view it as \u201cI told you this bothered my partner, but you did it anyway.\u201d\n\nA better way to accomplish what I\u2019m gleaning from this is just having a talk with her about how  her partner\u2019s stance makes her feel, and if she finds that fair or not.

A lot of those guys, when they enter into a relationship, end up with a partner who feels self-conscious, or uncomfortable, or jealous because of the porn/masturbation. And some of these partners never make demands, but do voice their concern/needs. But none of that enters into sex between them, so why should it matter?

On afternoon I was hanging out my laundry and he popped his head over the fence for a chat so I told him to come over and give me a hand. I handed him one of my husbands T-shirt\u2019s to hang out then some other items while we chatted, then I handed him one of my sexy lace panties, he just stared at them as he held them. I winked at him and said you would have seen plenty of them before, he turned red and mumbled something about being too shy. I asked if he wanted me to help him build his confidence and he looked up and nodded so I told him to come inside and had him sit at the dining table\n\n> I\u2019m sure he assumed I was going to tell him some tips but instead I striped naked, climbed on to the dining table and lay in front of him so he had full view of my spread legs. I slowly started rubbing my clit in circular motion and lightly pinching my nipples while explaining what pressure to apply and ensuring he new it was important to slide his fingers down occasionally to keep the fingers wet with the pussy juices while playing with the clit. I asked him if he would like to try, he obliged and was a fast learner. I showed him how if he pushes his fingers deep inside he will find the special spot and if he also uses he palm to rub on the clit at the correct angle and when applying the right amount of pressure he will be rewarded with a squirting pussy.\n\n> I enjoyed our lessons and watching his confidence grow with every orgasm he gave me\n\n**YTA**\n\nI'm gonna go out on a limb here and say you want to fuck your friend, who doesn't want to fuck you.

Because this really doesn't need to involve him, or impact their sex life in any way. Her owning a vibrator doesn't have to have anything to do with him. People can use them with their partner of course, but I imagine most vibrators see the most action when their owners are alone. \n\nI think if she's expressed that she wants one, and you guys have a very close relationship and usually feel comfortable discussing sex etc with one another, then I don't see it as an inappropriate gift for one friend to buy another friend.

Assuming that she wants to.", "Wanting to buy one for your friend who doesn't want one is something only a masturbation addict would do", "To check if a vibrator will be too powerful (aka hurt or make you numb) you turn it on and touch it to the tip of your nose. If you feel like you're gonna sneeze, it's too much for you.\n\nThis trick is for people who are using it on their clitoris.", "\u201cHey honey, look what Greg got me *waves around a fleshlight*.

She\u2019s not making her use it.  She\u2019s not talking to the boyfriend and saying that best friend would really like to use a vibe in their play. (That would be a serious invasion).  Assuming OP gives the gift in a private setting (ie no boyfriend around), it\u2019s up to best friend to decide how to proceed. She can throw it away and never think about it again if she wants. She can hide it and use it without her boyfriend if she wants. Or she can find a way and/or discussion to incorporate it into play with her boyfriend.  \n\nI started writing this response leaning more towards N A H or Y T A, but assuming OP gives the gift in private and allows best friend the space to decide what to do next, I think NTA. If gifting in front of bf and forcing the conversation, Y T A.\n\nAlso in response to a different comment, sex toys as gifts between friends is not unusual. Very common bachelorette gifts. True, I don\u2019t think the majority of people gift toys (or even own toys), but it\u2019s not uncommon for a lot of people, especially those who are open about sexuality or are in general, sex positive.", "This.... This is the correct response. \n\nLeave the sex out of it you don't get to tell other people what to do OP.  Seek professional help.", "The present recipient is not forced anyways to use it.

There definitely is a decent group of people who would buy these things for their friends. I\u2019ve known some.

The thing being, I wasn't trying to sleep with them from that point. \n\nIt's a really personal thing if you have that sort of relationship with her, go for it.

How is that even a thing?!?", "Lolz. BUZZ kill", "Holy shit!! That explains soooo much!", "Well I think the nose check works for if you're inserting it as well but if you have a penis and are using it on the underside of the tip you can usually do much stronger vibration than what your nose can handle", "I am probably overstepping here but I feel like piling on her could open lines of communication between.

But only if I win the lottery because vibrators can be crazy expensive.", "Why? Seniors don\u2019t deserve pleasure too?", "That's your opinion, and you're free to keep it. For me, I'll just leave it at affirming that things like this can sometimes be willingly given up/sacrificed for the sake of a relationship, and that be a good decision for people who choose to do that.
