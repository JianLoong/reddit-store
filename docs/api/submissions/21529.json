You said you were \"shocked\" she never owned one. I dont think its as uncommon as you think for women not to own a vibrator or have an interest in using one.\n\nAs a person in a relationship, if someone gifted me a sex toy or gifted my partner a sex toy with the assumption that it was no doubt going to be a net positive, I would think that's creepy (why are you thinking about my sex life so much) and way out of bounds.\n\nAnd then I'd have to have a conversation with my SO about what the \"gifting dildos\" policy is in our relationship is.

If it will upset her partner, it follows that it will probably upset her as well. Why would you want to do that? You gave her your opinion, and she is an adult capable of purchasing one for herself if she wants to. Find a more appropriate gift.", "YWBTA\n\nGreat! You think they're amazing.  But, your friend has told you why she has never bought one - why would you risk their relationship just because you *think* you know what's good for them?\n\n> she told me she has never ever owned one.. Not something I have forgotten as it was a little shocking to me.\n\nI don't understand why you think this is shocking - I'm willing to bet there are millions of women in western countries that dont own or have never used a vibrator.", "If she wants one but wont because of her partner, i am gonna say you wouldnt be, but he is if he is preventing her trying it.\n\nIf her partner would have a problem with her over her friend giving her a gift she has no control over then your friend is better off without him.\n\nPersonally i think there is a chance it may work to open his mind a bit more to it, but i also dont know them maybe he is a huge dick and will lose his shit, idk i dont know him at all.\n\nPerhaps ask others who know them, or even ask your friend if she would be ok with it, people on the internet dont know them or you and what you are all like together ect so imo it isnt rly helpful in this situation.", "not a popular opinion but depending on how close i are i would say why not. if you\u2019re really close then yes, go for it. if you aren\u2019t v close then nah. vibrators are amazing and i gifted my friend one once (it was a harry styles one as a joke but still useable haha) but we were best friends. if u do get her one, explain your reasonings and possibly approve it w her before u buy it. i wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole but having a sex positive friend is an amazing luxury as i\u2019ve found out myself lol", "You see, the thing is it\u2019s a little odd. When and if she uses it, it will remind her of you. Ywbta", "YTA. Its fine to get her one. Not as a birthday gift where the chances of him asking \"hey, what did your best friend get you\" are high.

Baby boy needs to grow up, learn to love his partner. You could keep the gift as anonymous as possible if that would help.

That would give her the ability to select something she is comfortable with and have her partner participate, which will make him more accepting of the item.", "I think it\u2019s a sad situation. Her partner isn\u2019t prioritizing her pleasure and your friend opened up to you and made it clear she wanted one but doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s \u201callowed\u201d to have one. That\u2019s a huge red flag in my opinion. Pardon the language but his ideas of masculinity shouldn\u2019t be threatened by the fact she can pleasure herself as well, I\u2019m sure he jerks off. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to gift someone this as a birthday present. She\u2019s an adult and needs to work that problem out herself.", "YWBTA. Not appropriate. This is not your business.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s completely appropriate. If she says she wants one and KNOWS you\u2019d be getting her one it\u2019s different because then she might be prepared to tell her partner, but to randomly get one puts her in an awkward position because she\u2019s not prepared to talk about it and breach that subject.

The y-t-as are ignoring the glaringly obvious problem: the boyfriend. Hes TA, not you OP. Everyone deserves self pleasure if they want it (within legality of course), and everyone deserves better than a guy who\u2019s threatened by sex toys, your friend included. He needs to grow up or get gone. I do agree with comments suggesting that you get a gift card instead, unless you feel confident that your toy will check all her boxes \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No you wouldn't be TA.

She again had never used one, had been through a messy divorce and had two young children - she saw the funny side of it. We'd talked about them in the pub a few weeks before her birthday which was when we found out she'd never had one or used one before.\n\nBeing adults, we have open conversations about this sort of thing \ud83e\udd37 She didn't know what we had planned, and certainly wasn't expecting it when she opened the gift bag then very quickly closed it at her birthday tea party \ud83d\ude02\n\n(It was me (f) and two friends (both m) who clubbed together to buy a decent one for her)", "Voting NTA for personal reasons. I don't think it's weird. I used to date a girl who had a group of friends and for birthdays, they'd gift each other vibrators as gag gifts, no pun intended. So I don't find it creepy or weird to do it. However, I would think it's better to get her a gift card and let her pick something out for herself. I've been to those stores and it's like being in the cereal aisle at the grocery store. There's lot of options. Also, do this privately with just you and here there. Doing anything at a party is crossing a line.\n\nAlso, it's her body and her choice of how she wants to get off. I don't know why her partner is so threatened by it. It's no different than him pleasuring himself. It's not another guy pleasuring her, it's herself doing it. If he doesn't like it, that's that's him problem, not a her problem.", "YTA\n\nShe knows how to get one. Nothing is stopping her but what she thinks are important feelings her partner has shared with her - and likely wouldn\u2019t appreciate her having shared with you. Get your nose out of their bedroom business and remember that when a friend vents or shares with you they\u2019re looking for a supportive listener, not a line-crossing meddler. And if that\u2019s hard for you imagine the situation in reverse. A man buys your partner a toy to use even though they explicitly said it is something you\u2019re not comfortable with. See, pretty gross and semi-violating isn\u2019t it?\n\nYou also have zero idea if his apprehension and issues around feeling emasculated are related to bad experiences in his past, or even traumatic ones. That\u2019s not something I\u2019d share with a friend. \n\nStop trying to impose your values and feelings on someone else\u2019s sex life. If she asks for your help getting one or a recommendation *then* you can offer to buy her one.", "YWBTA. Even if her partner has the worst reasons, it's her relationship with him and she decides when and if to breach that issue. She's a grown woman and you can buy a vibrator at fucking Walmart now.

Even with your reasoning, she\u2019d likely view it as \u201cI told you this bothered my partner, but you did it anyway.\u201d\n\nA better way to accomplish what I\u2019m gleaning from this is just having a talk with her about how  her partner\u2019s stance makes her feel, and if she finds that fair or not.

That's point one. \n\nJust as importantly, you're right, at least in theory (if not in practice) people in a relationship shouldn't make absolute demands on this or much else. But you're assuming a \"compromise\" is about one partner telling the other what to do and making it an absolute. We don't know that for this case. And even if he didn't make those demands, that doesn't mean his own needs would be met if this stuff would make him uncomfortable during sex or in the relationship. Plenty of people choose to stay silent with this kind of situation (because they know they have no right to demand anything), and the discomfort and/or hurt builds up until it turns to resentment and the relationship suffers. The fact that OP's friend wishes to respect that in her partner is a sign that she wants to prioritize his needs in this context, so that by doing so, it may be better for both of them in their relationship. It's also a sign that they've been able to communicate about needs in this area. \n\nPlenty of couples have to figure this kind of stuff out. It's part of being in a  relationship: what the other person thinks or feels matters. I'm glad it's not your experience to make compromises like this, that's a really good thing.

Like, if my friend wanted something but someone he'd been with for a month didn't want him to have it, I'd get it for him anyway because the friendship overrides the new relationship at that point. But if my married friend wanted something and had chosen not to get it because his wife wouldn't be happy, I wouldn't get it for him as a gift, because, in that case, marriage trumps friendship. And every other relationship is somewhere in between...\n\nI agree it's weird to feel insecure about your partner having a toy though.

I am pro toys but I get that not everyone is comfortable with that.... but honestly, if the friend has been wanting a vibrator, seems pretty shitty for everyone to just be like, siding with her partner, whos issue with it seems pretty childish? I think the best thing would be for OP to talk to the friend again about whether she wants one, and to kind of support & help prepare for a conversation between the friend and her partner on introducing a vibrator either just for herself or into their sex life as a couple. then after that, if it's been cleared by the partner, OP can take her friend shopping - bc there are so many different types of vibrator and I would hate to be surprised by a type that wouldn't feel good to me.", "Again, he may not be setting a rule, and he may not even be making demands in that area. But what would someone do if it was something that made them uncomfortable or feel hurt? He can voice his needs without making a demand or setting an ultimatum. And OP's friend can choose to prioritize that, and that doesn't make her a bad person. \n\nJust to give a counterexample: plenty of men have porn/masturbation habits. A lot of those guys, when they enter into a relationship, end up with a partner who feels self-conscious, or uncomfortable, or jealous because of the porn/masturbation. And some of these partners never make demands, but do voice their concern/needs. But none of that enters into sex between them, so why should it matter? It's just the guy's body that's involved, right?
