But I really loved my life with my mom.\n\nWhen I was 14, my father basically threatened to have my mother arrested if she didn't let him have custody of me.\n\nSo against my own wishes, I was forced to move back to my dad's home full time.\n\nI hated it here and I essentially lived a separate life from my dad and his family.\n\nWhen I was 16, my grandad died and had left his company to his two sons (my dad and uncle) and me. We all got a third ownership. \n\nMy dad and uncle had more kids but my grandfather never updated the will. My family says it's because he got too old to remember. \n\nSo here is where I think I'm the asshole. Since I was 16, I didn't know any better and my dad and uncle just ran the company themselves.\n\nBut when I turned 18, my dad and uncle talked to me about splitting the company 50/50 between them so they could split it fairly among all the grandkids instead.\n\nI would get a cash payout of $300k for my share.\n\nBut I talked to a lawyer on my own and refused to agree. In addition, I asked for my share of the profits since the past two years and that I'd be part of the business going forward while I was going to college.\n\nThis has made life extremely difficult for my dad. My uncle is extremely resentful that only one grandchild gets a huge stake. And my dad is now paying me my share of the profits for the past two years out of his own pocket just to keep the peace.\n\nAITA? Maybe if I was on better terms with my father, I'd be open to their plan. \n\nBut I feel that he decided to force me to give up my life with my mom and he can deal with the consequences.", "created_utc": 1678716099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qajww/aita_for_pushing_myself_into_the_family_business/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've done nothing wrong.", "NTA, you're only taking what was rightfully given to you.  Too bad for the other kids that the will was never updated, but not your fault.", "NTA there might be a small moral element to this if there wasn't one huge hiccup.  They didn't already have things set up to accrue your share of the profits, they were just taking them for themselves!

It is not my fault grandpa didn\u2019t update his will. You and uncle need to stop blaming me. \n2. It is not my fault that since the age of 8 I\u2019ve been a pawn in the game between you and mom. Stop treating me like a game piece to be moved upon the board and treat me like your child. \n3. It is not my fault I was obstinate when forced to move in with you at the age of 16. Again, you and mom were using me as a game piece and not treating me like a person. \n4. The simple fact of the matter is I\u2019m 1/3 owner of the business and have not seen profits.

Your dad is \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d with his brother BUT didn\u2019t care about the mother of his child or making sure you felt welcomed? Correct me if I am wrong?  I would say NTA from what you have shared. 300k is a lot of money, BUT if they offered that, and if your dad had money to keep a custody battle going for 6 years, when you were visiting anyway, I suspect the business is worth a lot more.", "I'm sure your father had his reasons for forcing you to move, but it sounds like you've found a way to make the best of a difficult situation.

Actual kidnapper, or parent that fought for custody and people think the kidnapper is a good person and the person that has absolute custody is abusive, because they got custody?", "Kidnapper? He fought her for six years, while also seeing his kid. That wasn't a fight for custody, that was using the courts as a weapon against the mom. It's a widely known tactic of predominantly men when wives try to leave.", "She literally kidnapped OP. it's why the dad could threaten to have her arrested. You can't just have people arrested for no reason. You can for kidnapping.", "Why would the length make that not a fight for custody?\n\nAlso, funny how you seem to be completely ignoring that the ex moved him 3 hours away against his will, likely illegally, too. Aka, she kidnapped him.", "You're not kidnapped when going back to spend the summers and most holidays with the other parent. Stop being dramatic. He not only saw his kid, spent time with him, but was able to still torment the mom even though she moved three hours away.", "Yes, needing a support network is usual when moms are left to do it alone. A six year custody battle that spans a kids near entire remaining childhood, while also seeing your kid regularly for visitation isn't indicative of a good relationship. Threatening the other parent with jail unless they hand over their ~~possession~~  kid ain't it either.", "Her want for a support network should not be more important than the son having his father as part of his life.\n\nAnd I disagree that the length of the custody battle bears any indication of how good of a father he is.\n\nAlso, if she didn't do something that would get her thrown in jail, he would have no threat to make. \n\nLastly, if you're still defending this mother choice to move her kid 3 hours away from his father, when the kid himself has said that she was wrong to do that, then I don't see this conversation going anywhere.\n\nHave a good day :)", "The son had the father in his life though.

Your uncles problem is with his own father, not with you.  I suspect there is more to your grandfathers Will, otherwise they would have challenged it.\n\nWhy did this make life difficult for your father - I don't believe your father is paying you the money you were owed out of his pocket.  It doesn't sound like the man who fought his ex for custody.\n\nCould it be that your father and uncle took those 2 years profits themselves and are aware now that you could (1) report the criminal offence (2) get them barr from acting as company directors becuase of the fraud (3) sue them for damages and a whole lot more\n\nThey stole from you for 2 years and now want to guilt you for the consequences of the crime.", "NTA I don't know you, but I am really proud of you for your level headed thinking.", "NTA and absolutely get yours.

Sure, we don't know what happened with the divorce and all, BUT if the father against his wishes, had his child removed from his care, then that is bad.

They're both parents, they both need to agree on that.", "If he really was trying to torment her, it wouldn't be a threat to have her arrested, he'd just do it. He was incredibly nice to give her the chance to do the right thing.", "indeed. So tell me, why would a man threaten a mom with jail eight years after the fact? Kid is 16 at this point. Why not do it at the start? Do you think it has something to do with not getting their way after weaponizing the court system?", "oh yeah? Cause the father doesn't appear to care about anyone's wishes unless it's his own.", "Oh, so you think he was being kind in saying he would then have her arrested eight years after she left him, and after six years of dragging her through the courts. Are you assuming it's over custody, or you've seen that written somewhere? There's lot of reasons people can be sent to jail and i'm sure confiding in a spouse who then can weaponize it would be juicy to an abuser.", "Yeah, 3 hours away. That's too far for partial custody. At best the father saw him for some vacations, maybe during the summer.\n\nThis kid absolutely did not have his father as a regular part of his daily life, and I don't think the mothers want of a support network is more important than the father being a regular part of his kids daily life.", "It wouldn't be a credible threat if he did not have a court order, so either he had just got it, or got sick of her non-compliance finally and told her he would be enforcing it and she needed to comply asap or go to jail. And pursuing custody is no weaponizing the courts. We don't know when the dad got this order, if he did, anything, at this point so this is just speculation but I would not think a threat would be made unless he had a viable court order.", "He fought for custody to get his son away from his kidnapper. Son may not have agreed with it at the time, but it's still in his best interest. He wouldn't have been able to get custody and have his son move back if she didn't illegally take him in the first place.", "Yes, thinking of what's best for his son, and thus not blowing up their relationship by getting his mother thrown in jail, is being kind.", "but he did have partial custody, he absolutely had the kid part of his regular life.", ">I hated it here and I essentially lived a separate life from my dad and his family.\n\nGood thing when he made that threat, and took his kid to live with him eight years later, he was a great and involved dad.", "And know father of the year is trying to fuck OP out of their inheritance because why exactly? He has always put OP\u2019s interests first? Don\u2019t think so", ">I hated it here and I essentially lived a separate life from my dad and his family.\n\nHe sounds super involved.", "Seeing your kid on holidays and during the summer is in no way having the kid as part of your regular life.\n\nThere's no evidence here that he was a bad father, or anything like that, so if she didn't put her wants over her sons best interest, and kidnapped him, he would have likely gotten equal custody.", "Good thing the Asshole OP was already poisoned against his father by his mother after 8 years of conditioning.", "I didn't say he's father of the year. Nor do I think he's right to try to mess with OPs inheritance.\n\nThat doesn't mean he was wrong in trying to get custody away from the kidnapper, or didn't have the sons best interests in mind regarding who has custody, though.", "Yeah no shit, he was happy with his mother, of course he'd be unhappy getting pulled away from that and forced to move 3 hours away. \n\nThat doesn't mean she was in the right for kidnapping him, though, or that the father shouldn't have fought for custody.\n\nIt's a shitty situation for both the father and the son to be in, but it was caused by the mother.\n\nAnd don't you dare try to say the father shouldn't have done what he did - if someone kidnapped your kid when he's too young to realize what they did, would you be happy to leave them with their kidnapper just because they're happy?"]}
