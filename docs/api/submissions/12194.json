Granted I'm not as familiar with US corporate law since I'm Canadian but it's not that different. \n\nTo anyone wondering, making the profit vanish is as simple as.  Declare a \"management bonus\" in the exact amount of the corporation's profit.  The bonus is paid only to the 2 people who actually work at the company.  Shareholders need to vote on this bonus, dad and uncle both vote yes, OP votes no and the vote passes. \n\nOP is only entitled to 1/3 of the shareholder votes, and/or 1/3 of any dividends.
