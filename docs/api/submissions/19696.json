There were complications in my pregnancy, and we were told she would be lucky to even make it to 2. We still gave her a bedroom, completed with pink walls, toys, and a crib. She never stayed in it, however (she slept in our room). Kacie passed away 4 years ago.\n\nA month ago, we had our 2nd child, a healthy baby boy, Dylan. There were no complications, and we want to give him the life his sister couldn't have. For the past month, he has also been staying in our room, but my husband and I agree that we should try him sleeping in another room. Our house only has 2 bedrooms: ours, and what was Kacie's. The crib, toys, and everything we got are still in there, so we wouldn't have to buy anything new or throw anything out.\n\nNow, a little context before the issue: my MIL, Deb, was very close with Kacie. A lot of the stuff in her room was either paid partially or entirely by Deb. She felt very strongly about our baby girl, and even talked about her being the favorite grandchild. When Kacie died, Deb was devastated. She paid for half the funeral expenses, while my mom paid for the other half. I have also always considered Deb and I to have a good relationship. We all grieved and healed together. She also seems to feel strongly about Dylan, but not in the same way she felt about Kacie.\n\nLast week, Deb came over for dinner. She wanted to see us, and we're always glad to have her over. We all sat down to eat, and Deb asked us about how having Dylan in the house was. My husband explained that the co-sleeping was great, but we wanted to see how he would do on his own. Deb asked what we meant by this, and we explained that we were thinking about bringing him into Kacie's room, as it would also be a good play room even if Dylan doesn't sleep in there in the end. After we said this, Deb stopped eating, excused herself from the table, and walked outside.\n\nMy husband and I followed her and asked her what was wrong. She starts scolding us, calling us horrible and heartless for trying to \"erase\" Kacie. We tried to explain that we will always have Kacie in our hearts, but Deb was not having any of it. She accused us of hating Kacie, and that we considered Dylan our only child. She said she will never be coming over or inviting us to any family event if we put Dylan in Kacie's room. She left after that.\n\nMy husband and I were shocked by this reaction. Deb has never reacted to anything like this before, she's always the one to be calm and collected during arguments and issues. But this blow-up has us thinking: were we wrong? Do we really have a bias towards Dylan? We don't feel this is the case, so I brought it here for another opinion. Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: For moving Dylan into Kacie's room, there would be a few changes, but not many. We would repaint the walls a very light powder blue, and properly store away anything that was personalized for Kacie. My mom made blankets for both babies, and Kacie's is in a frame. We're a little tight on money, so Dylan would use the crib and toys there until we can get him other things. We do not plan on pushing Deb away, but space sounds like the best option while we all cool down.\n\nEdit 2: Wow, there's a lot of comments! Henry and I dropped Dylan off with my mom and went to Dave and Busters for 2 hours, and now I come back to 155 comments. I'm going to try to respond to as many people as I can to answer questions, but I might not get too far tonight as we just put Dylan down and Momma needs some sleep!\n\nEdit 3: I actually can't believe I left out a super important piece of information \ud83d\ude05 After we lost Kacie, Henry and I waited 2 years to try for another baby. We went through 3 miscarriages before we had Dylan. Dylan is a miracle -- there's a strong possibility that with my complications with my first and 3 miscarriages, I won't be able to have any more children without it compromising mine and/or the baby's health.", "created_utc": 1686770463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149gjjl/aita_for_wanting_to_turn_my_late_daughters/", "score": 433, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't loving one child more than the other. You are giving the living child the best opportunities you can give him.  No one should dare compare the two.  \n\nOn behalf of DYLAN, WHO IS HERE WITH YOU, please do not ever make him feel like second fiddle to someone who is dead. He should live w/o having to live up to something he can't, b/c it exists only in your hearts.\n\nUgh, again, MIL is very self-absorbed, but your obligation as Dylan's parents is to love, protect etc so have your husband let his mom know very nicely that he is getting 100% of everything you can give  moving forward.", "NTA.\n\nWhat are supposed to do ?

You are grieving as well; you\u2019re not replacing her. Honestly her attitude has me a little worried for Dylan because he\u2019s not the granddaughter she wanted. What ever you decide to do, just know that it\u2019s YOUR decision, and you\u2019re allowed to do what you want.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Your MIL needs help to adjust, though.

Dylan deserves a room as well.

You have a two bedroom home. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t make that Dylan\u2019s room. He may be one month old now but he can\u2019t stay in your bedroom forever. You\u2019re passing on Kacie\u2019s items to her baby brother. The memories with Kacie will always be there and there are memories still to be made with Dylan. I think your MIL needs to see a grief counselor to work through these feelings more than anything. She may have been very close to Kacie, but you and your husband were her parents. There\u2019s no right words in a loss like yours but there are wrong ones. Please don\u2019t let what your MIL said get in either of your heads, it was highly inappropriate and said out of strong emotions.", "NTA.\n\nThis must have been horrible for you to go through, and I'm sorry to hear what has happened. Evidently it has definitely affected your MIL heavily, yet her ideas for how your own child sleeps has absolutely nothing to do with her. What are you meant to do? Just leave an entire room lying around while your child shares a room with you for all of the foreseeable future? Of course, I can see where your MIL is coming from - just by too big of an extent. Try to tell her how Kacie will be treasured with you forever, but time will continue to move on.\nHope all goes well.", "NTA\n\nDeb is understandably emotional, she connected extra with Kacie because she was ill and frail \\[and her only granddaughter, I read now in a comment\\]. Her sorrow is valid. But the dead are dead, and the living matter more. To deny Dylan, also a baby, his own place in life, to have him live under the shadow of his sister who is not even alive, is cruel. You as a parent surely suffered the loss of your own baby more than Deb, but she is entitled to her sorrow, even if unreasonable. Be compassionate of her. To shun her out would make you TA.\n\nTry and appeal to Deb's protective and maternal side (that she clearly has) in favour of Dylan. How Dylan has lost his older sister and doesn't even know yet, but will surely be consoled to know how he got to grow up in his sister's room (and hence was always with her) once he is old enough to learn about Kacie.  Keep some of her sister's things (if not all), and point out to Ded how he loves that particular toy she bought for Kacie, as if he knew it was Kacie's. Ask Deb to tell Dylan about Kacie.

How does the song go again?\").", "NTA. You only have 2 bedrooms. The baby is going to need a bedroom. It\u2019s sad, I can\u2019t imagine losing a child, but needs must.

I\u2019d be wary that she might avoid or shame your son for living when your daughter passed away.", "NTA. I'm not sure wtf she thinks you're supposed to do.

You have had a chance to think it through and get used to the idea.  It is a hard thing fir you all.  \n\nThere seems to be no was to avoid the conflict you have with your MIL.    It seems to me she said some unreasonably hurtful things.  I do get that.  I also think that was grief talking.  She is not ready to make the changes and was likely shocked when you mentioned this.   I think that, if you can, forgiving her will be helpful.   Her reaction seems to be from anger, not judgement or hate.  \n\nThis is a tall order and a lot to ask.

Clearly you loved Kacie very much. \n\nIt's wonderful that you have Dylan now and that you have this beautiful new opportunity to find joy in your lives as his parents. I understand MIL's grief, but she is really overstepping here. You are most definitely NTA for wanting to take the best care possible of your baby boy and make the best life for him. He absolutely should have that room.", "NTA. It's impossible for that room to stay a shrine for your daughter. You have a living son who will need a room. You only have two bedrooms. Your MIL is being unfair and unrealistic. \n\nI'm sure you love your daughter every bit as much as you love your son. But sadly, she's not here and he is and he will need a room.\n\nIt really sounds like your MIL needs therapy because this isn't a healthy way to grieve. She's throwing away a relationship with a living grandchild. And it sounds like you may need to protect your son from her if she cannot move past this and love and accept him. Do not let her become a hateful person in his life.", "NAH\n\nDeb was obviously very close to Kacie and I think it\u2019s very sweet that they had such a close relationship. Grief is complicated and I can definitely see how the sudden thought of putting Dylan in Kacie\u2019s room could have felt quite overwhelming and emotional.\n\nOf course packing away Kacie\u2019s things and making room for Dylan is necessary. I\u2019m sure after the emotions settle Deb will see that it\u2019s a reasonable option - this is just her immediate reaction to a heartbreaking situation. Kacie\u2019s room is a big piece left of her and I can definitely see how changing it can trigger feelings of erasure and heartache. Her outburst simply came from a place of love and sentimentality for your daughter. \n\nTry not to be too harsh on your MIL. She is grieving as I\u2019m sure you are too. Remind her that Kacie will (of course) always always be in your hearts. Perhaps when you change the room for Dylan you can put something up in Kacie\u2019s memory (a picture of her in the living space, a shelf of some of her favorite things or something else that\u2019s sentimental to her). \n\nLosing a child must be incredibly tough. It sounds like there\u2019s a lot of love in your family. Stick together and help each other through it as gently as you can. Grief can cloud our judgement at times.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss OP.", "I'm going to go with a NAH simply because your MIL's connection was so deep that she is having this strong of a reaction, she needs therapy to help her get over the grief. It's unreasonable to not use that room for your child when there are only two bedrooms. Plus, she doesn't get to decide what room is used for what in your own home. \n\nThere's no bias towards the child that is depending on you to survive, you are not trying to erase Kacie, and you don't hate Kacie. Your MIL is having a hard time dealing with, processing, and moving past her grief and she needs some help. Y'all are taking care of your son in the way y'all see fit.", "NTA. Ask her where she thinks your son's room should be. An outside shed? A garage? \n\nApparently you can't move, either, as that would be leaving her room to (gasp!) strangers!", "NAH--yet. OP, I am so very sorry for the loss of your daughter. There is absolutely nothing at all wrong with your husband and yourself deciding to put Dylan in the only other bedroom in the house, be it Kacie's old room or not. If you and your husband have come to a point where you are ready and comfortable with this transition then you should move ahead with it and not feel bad at all. The reason I feel that NAH is that grief affects everyone differently, and there should be room for compassion here. You and your husband have already been discussing this for a while but for your MIL it came up unexpectedly. She was close with Kacie and this move likely shook her because she loved her so much. Should she have behaved that way? No, of course not, but she was likely just in shock from having that grief would 'poked'. I would give her some space in order to sit with the new information so that she has time to come to terms with the fact. If she continues to behave this way and wants to punish you for what you've decided is best for your family, then she is definitely the AH, but considering she likely just felt a little blindsided by this information (warranted or not), that this is not her usual behaviour, and that her bond with Kacie was so strong, I would give her a chance to gather herself. At the end of the day, this is your family and your children, and you and your husband know what is best for everyone. Best of luck to all of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have seen it take years to tackle the changes to a bedroom, and it seems to have been this way for you to. There is nothing negative about making this your sons room. Best wishes to you all.\n\nHoping Deb just needs some time.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry but to tell the PARENTS who lost their first child that they are \"horrible and heartless\" is exceptionally cruel. I'm sure she's going through some psychological pain but in her foolish quest she's actively erasing your son's existence. I actually would ban her until she starts grief counseling. Her relationship with your son will be fraught with tension until she gets her head on straight.", "NTA. No reasonable person would expect you to forever keep as a memorial one of two bedrooms in your house. Nevermind that it is no one else's decision as to what you do with that space.", "Deb has some audacity to claim you\u2019re trying to \u201cerase\u201d YOUR DAUGHTER. She\u2019s obviously going to see Dylan as a 2nd place to Kacie for the rest of his life. The nerve she\u2019s got is unreal. NTA.", "NTA. And also, I see your MIL was deeply affected by the passing of Kacie. I'd recommend talking to her and make her understand what the situation is. This might go well or not, but I don't see a bad relationship with her from your comments.\n\nAlso, your husband should be firm in the family choice. Even if your MIL doesn't agree, she doesn't really have a saying. You might agree to some things, but the choice is your husband's and yours.", "Put aside some money for therapy for Dylan later on. That is not a healthy way for a grandmother to react towards a grandchild.", "NTA what a manipulative personn", "INFO: A year ago you were an eighteen year old having a dispute with your sister about a cat and social media, and asking advice about melting stuffed animals in your dorm laundry room. Why are you writing fiction about dead children on the internet?", "NTA... I understand that Deb feels an emotional connection to the room & objects, but it's irrational. Just because you don't have an altar to Kacie doesn't mean you don't love her, and imo Deb is overreacting a little bit. Also... it's been 4 years. I would recommend some therapy for her (obv losing a family member you love can be scarring) and trying to mend your relationship with her by preserving several objects in a small memorial or something for Kacie. But you're def not erasing Kacie if you're using the room and decide not to do that.", "NTA\u2026 Specifically for the reason that your house only had two rooms. Clearly your MIL is emotional about the loss of her granddaughter (my condolences to everyone \ud83d\udc90), but (God, do I feel really insensitive saying this, even though it is in no way the intent) there really wouldn\u2019t be a better use for her old room. I\u2019m guessing your MIL is just thinking of Kacie in this situation because of their relationship and isn\u2019t thinking of what needs to happen for Dylan. I saw your comment about not going to move houses for a while at least, so I don\u2019t think you can have your son sleep with you as he grows (coming from a non-parent). This would be the better change for Dylan, and you would not be erasing Kacie by putting her old bedroom to use\u2026 \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "NTA. Your MIL is the Ah only because she has some unrealistic expectations of where you're supposed to attach your pocket dimension to add another room onto your home for your child. You have a bedroom that needs to be used as a bedroom, not a shrine.\n\nAn idea to help her get over her grief might be to offer your MIL some of what's left in Kacie's room to keep at her place. To have for her own grieving process. And she needs therapy, because she's not using her logic brain right now. It's 1 room in a 2 bedroom home and it needs to be used as a bedroom. I'm sorry for your losses, because it wasn't just Kacie you lost, but all the other almosts as well. She's only focusing on the child she was attached to. MIL needs to talk to someone unrelated (hence therapy) and get an unbiased perspective. \n\nPut some stuff aside and offer it to her when she wants it, but you can't be expected to host a shrine to Kacie in your home as a whole room when you have an entire child that needs to be loved as well.", "NTA, I am so sorry for your loss but congratulations on having that sweet baby boy of yours.", "If Deb needs that room to be a shrine to Kacie, she can pay in full for the new addition to your home to house Dylan. Otherwise, you need the space.", "I will always and forever miss Kacie and the time I had with with her, but I don't ever want Dylan to feel he is living in her shadow. He is my baby boy -- and his own person. I do want to teach him to savor every moment of life he has because of Kacie, but I don't want him to think every decision I make is based off of her. I want him to know that he is my child that I will love and cherish just as much as I love and cherish his sister and the memory of her. \n\nThis may sound weird: after Kacie died, my stomach felt empty. Or, I guess, my WOMB felt empty. It was the first time I had noticed that the weight wasn't there anymore, like the feeling of motherhood was ripped away from me. But, with Dylan, I have my motherhood back. My womb feels full again. Like I'm still connected to him, but not physically. Dylan is not a replacement baby, he's his own person who I will attempt to raise to be an extraordinary human.", "I don't want us to lose, I want to be able to fix this. I'm not mad at my MIL, I just feel stuck between a rock and a hard place.", "She would have!! Kacie and Dylan would have been bunkmates, and they would have hated every second. Kacie was very quiet, while Dylan's a screecher when he's woken up from his beauty sleep \ud83d\ude02 I giggle just thinking about it!", "I will! Referring to the room as Kacie's for right now is more for clarity in the situation.", "I'm a high school teacher, and he works for the same school district working I.T., but obviously, it's summer and I was on maternity leave, as well. In terms of moving houses, that's a distant future.", "You sound like an amazing mother. I grew up in a kind of similar circumstance and my grandmother was super over the top about it too. If your MIL continues to act this way as Dylan gets older he will pick up on it. He will know that he\u2019s living in Kacie\u2019s shadow in his grandmother\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s gonna hurt for him once he catches on and begins to process it, but as long as you show up for Dylan and support Dylan he\u2019ll be okay. I don\u2019t recommend forcing him to have a relationship with Deb if he doesn\u2019t want to, let Dylan decide who Deb is to him once he\u2019s old enough to have an opinion on it.", "You need to protect Dylan. She is only going to get worse.", "I'm definitely considering!! I like to think I have a good relationship with my MIL, which I'm lucky to have. I don't want to push her out, I want us to find a solution that will keep our family together.", "Deb had 5 sons, no daughters. From what I've heard, my husband Henry was the one who gave her the hardest time, but they all were some level of rowdy. God bless the woman, she had triplets on her first pregnancy, twins on the second. Henry is the oldest of the triplets -- a whopping 4 minutes and 36 seconds -- and he is the only one who is married to a woman, one triplet and one twin are gay and with their husbands. Her husband died when the boys were still fairly young, and I never met him. She never remarried, and raised 5 men who are the best husband/uncles ever! But I know having 2 more females around was a blessing, especially a baby girl.", "First- OP, I am so very sorry for your loss. And yeah, the \u201cshe talked of Kacie being the favorite grandchild\u201d etc. has me concerned. If Kacie was here and Dylan was born, I bet there would be a lot of favoritism. It seems like Deb was VERY invested in having a granddaughter specifically and may resent that the lost child was \u201creplaced\u201d with a boy. (I\u2019m not saying that OP and husband replaced Kacie, btw, just saying that this may be Deb\u2019s mindset) Deb really needs counseling because it seems like she hasn\u2019t processed her grief properly. And if she keeps this up, she\u2019s going to lose a lot more than a granddaughter.", "That's a different post. But that is just as heartbreaking of a story.", "Now I'm curious how she treats you vs her sons husbands.\n\nRegardless, none of that is an excuse for how she treats your son. He is alive and his needs come first over his sister who has passed.\n\nBesides there was no guarantee your daughter was going to be a stereotypical girl. Especially with all them uncles. Even I who was raised mostly around women grew up to be very much the tomboy.", "That's a different story for another time...very complicated relationship between my MIL and her sons.", "NTA. She needs a grief counselor.", "Nta.\n\nI have 3 kids and had several miscarriages.  My youngest uses his older siblings stuff, because siblings share.  \n\nI am not trying to compare child loss to miscarriage, but, just wanted to add, I lost a baby in the 2nd trimester.  He had received 1 gift, a blanket.  Initially, I was keeping it in a box, with all his other things, like ultrasounds and stuff. But I decided to have jybother kids use it. I lost him 11 years ago and I think of him every time his little brother uses his blanket, it makes me feel close to him.", "NTA for giving Dylan the room, but please do some research before letting him spend the night there on his own. Babies should sleep in the same room as their parents until around 6 months to lower the risk of SIDS.", "After reading a few comments I've seen a few people mention grief counseling for MIL, I would suggest even just general therapy as it sounds like the loss of little Kacie is only a part of the issue. I have no idea how you'd bring this up though as it seems she'd reject the advice if it came from you both, especially right now. I really hope she finds a way to deal with her grief and becomes the grandmother Dylan deserves.", "Just a suggestion: which of the five sons has a good relationship with her to offer support and suggest a grief counselor?\nContext: I have a cousin who spoke with me and who I trusted enough to listen to when I couldn't listen to others. He was not directly involved so I was able to hear him out more easily.\nMy condolences for your losses.", "NTA\n\nThere are NAH. Everyone deals with grief in different ways, and if this outburst is the complete opposite of how your MIL would typically behave then she has not healed. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that Dylan is a trigger, not his fault not yours, but memories can reopen wounds that were not properly healed.  With a new baby in the home I\u2019m certain it\u2019s brought up some old memories for everyone who loved Kacie. \n\nSome grief counseling is advisable if she is unable to see the logic in your choices.   Once again everyone grieves differently, and it doesn\u2019t hurt to reach out for extra support when needed.\n\nIt\u2019s been 4 years, and even though that will never diminish your family\u2019s love for Kacie, there are new circumstances and needs that have to be addressed with Dylan. \n\nMaybe a rephrasing of the situation for MIL\u2019s sake would be be a helpful transition tool.  Perhaps stating that Dylan will be sharing a room with Kacie at first until MIL is able to warm up to the situation over time, and piece by piece over an extended period of time redecorate the room, while still keeping those pieces on display in a special part of the room, or allow Kacie to have a new special place in the home that still highlights her memory.  \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t have to coddle her, this is merely a suggestion if you wanted to attempt a gentler approach for any of your family that may be struggling with their grief. \n\nI am sorry for your loss and understand that everything around this situation is also incredibly sensitive for you, so if any of those suggestions would cause you undo stress, heartache, or additional grief then please disregard the suggestions.\n\nCongratulations on Dylan. I pray for joy, peace and healing for you and all of your family during this transition.", "NTA about that, but if you're so broke you can't buy your son toys, why are you going to Dave and busters and leaving your 1 month old with your mom? This blows my mind. Never would have left my kids with someone else when they were a month old.", "Nta. De(r)b is way  overstepping. I personally wouldn't let these comments slide. How totally unhinged and cruel of her so say stuff like this.", "NTA. Grief is complicated, and it sounds as though this has brought up very raw feelings for your MIL about her grandchild. It will probably take time for her to process it. But it is in no way inappropriate for you to have your baby sleep in the nursery room. \n\nI'm sorry for your losses.", "Passing on the items\u2026 I wonder if it would help, or hurt, to frame it as Kacie sharing her baby things with her little brother, like it\u2019s her way of looking out for him and being a part of his childhood. Even though she\u2019s moved on she can provide this for him, to ease his way into the world.\n\n\u2026Is that too weird? Apologies if it\u2019s inappropriate, I\u2019ve never had a baby & can hardly even imagine how everyone in the family is feeling.", "So my sister died when she was 9 and I was 11. My parents kept her room exactly the same. \n\n10 years later and I\u2019d moved out so they decided to buy a new house - my dead sister got a room and all her stuff was moved into it. It\u2019s been over 30 years now and she still has a room in a house that she never even saw. \n\nThey\u2019re looking at retiring now and want to move to an assisted living complex, but they have to wait for one of the big units to become available because they need at least 3 bedrooms, one for them, one for craft, one for my sister.\n\nEdit: OP is NTA btw. My parents behaviour is nuts. Use the room, you only have 2 of them and you have a kid to take care of.", "I love this answer. So sorry for your loss."]}
