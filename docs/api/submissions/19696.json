There were complications in my pregnancy, and we were told she would be lucky to even make it to 2. We still gave her a bedroom, completed with pink walls, toys, and a crib. She never stayed in it, however (she slept in our room). Kacie passed away 4 years ago.\n\nA month ago, we had our 2nd child, a healthy baby boy, Dylan. There were no complications, and we want to give him the life his sister couldn't have. For the past month, he has also been staying in our room, but my husband and I agree that we should try him sleeping in another room. Our house only has 2 bedrooms: ours, and what was Kacie's. The crib, toys, and everything we got are still in there, so we wouldn't have to buy anything new or throw anything out.\n\nNow, a little context before the issue: my MIL, Deb, was very close with Kacie. A lot of the stuff in her room was either paid partially or entirely by Deb. She felt very strongly about our baby girl, and even talked about her being the favorite grandchild. When Kacie died, Deb was devastated. She paid for half the funeral expenses, while my mom paid for the other half. I have also always considered Deb and I to have a good relationship. We all grieved and healed together. She also seems to feel strongly about Dylan, but not in the same way she felt about Kacie.\n\nLast week, Deb came over for dinner. She wanted to see us, and we're always glad to have her over. We all sat down to eat, and Deb asked us about how having Dylan in the house was. My husband explained that the co-sleeping was great, but we wanted to see how he would do on his own. Deb asked what we meant by this, and we explained that we were thinking about bringing him into Kacie's room, as it would also be a good play room even if Dylan doesn't sleep in there in the end. After we said this, Deb stopped eating, excused herself from the table, and walked outside.\n\nMy husband and I followed her and asked her what was wrong. She starts scolding us, calling us horrible and heartless for trying to \"erase\" Kacie. We tried to explain that we will always have Kacie in our hearts, but Deb was not having any of it. She accused us of hating Kacie, and that we considered Dylan our only child. She said she will never be coming over or inviting us to any family event if we put Dylan in Kacie's room. She left after that.\n\nMy husband and I were shocked by this reaction. Deb has never reacted to anything like this before, she's always the one to be calm and collected during arguments and issues. But this blow-up has us thinking: were we wrong? Do we really have a bias towards Dylan? We don't feel this is the case, so I brought it here for another opinion. Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: For moving Dylan into Kacie's room, there would be a few changes, but not many. We would repaint the walls a very light powder blue, and properly store away anything that was personalized for Kacie. My mom made blankets for both babies, and Kacie's is in a frame. We're a little tight on money, so Dylan would use the crib and toys there until we can get him other things. We do not plan on pushing Deb away, but space sounds like the best option while we all cool down.", "created_utc": 1686770463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149gjjl/aita_for_wanting_to_turn_my_late_daughters/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you perpetually going to have an empty room while your growing child sleeps with you?\n\nIt also really isn't fair to play that guilt card of \"hating\" or \"erasing\" your dead child because you need to use the room.", "NTA. Firstly, I\u2019m sorry for you guy\u2019s loss. I know this is a sensitive subject so I\u2019ll put it like this, Kacie is unfortunately no longer with you guys. Whether the room is changed now or 10 years from now that fact will never change. I understand Deb is hurt but I\u2019m sure you guys are too, so that\u2019s no excuse to act out. Deb is ultimately being unfair to Dylan and you guys. This is something she should be supporting to help you move forward for Dylan. Ultimately it\u2019s up to you guys and Deb needs to respect that or keep her distance. Again, sorry about your baby girl.", "NTA\n\nWhile Deb is allowed to grieve, this is not her house and neither Kacie nor Dylan are her children (as they were her grandchildren).

You aren't loving one child more than the other. You are giving the living child the best opportunities you can give him.  No one should dare compare the two.  \n\nOn behalf of DYLAN, WHO IS HERE WITH YOU, please do not ever make him feel like second fiddle to someone who is dead. He should live w/o having to live up to something he can't, b/c it exists only in your hearts.\n\nUgh, again, MIL is very self-absorbed, but your obligation as Dylan's parents is to love, protect etc so have your husband let his mom know very nicely that he is getting 100% of everything you can give  moving forward.", "NTA.\n\nWhat are supposed to do ? What did you MIL expected you to do ?\n\nYour son was never going ho stay in your room forever.\n\nKacie is gone.

All sleep in the same room and just have a spare room that no one can ever touch because it\u2019s a monument to your late daughter? Deb seems to forget that Kacie is YOUR daughter. You are grieving as well; you\u2019re not replacing her. Honestly her attitude has me a little worried for Dylan because he\u2019s not the granddaughter she wanted. What ever you decide to do, just know that it\u2019s YOUR decision, and you\u2019re allowed to do what you want.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Your MIL needs help to adjust, though. She very clearly is not willing to honor the past and live in the present.", "NTA \n\nGrief impacts people many different ways and i feel like she's projecting her own fears here. If she loves your son then she feels like she's betraying your daughter in someway. Probably scared of losing him too.\n\nLeave her to calm down then say you never want to forget your daughter and kacie things are very special to you. That'd your not throwing it away it is just your son needs his own space and sooner  or later is gonna be wandering around. \n\nAsk her if she could keep her things safe because you'd like Dylan to have them as keepsakes of the sister he never knew when he's old enough to appreciate them", "NTA \n\nFrankly this is none of your MILs business.

Dylan deserves a room as well. If Kacie was alive they would be sharing the room anyway. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s not much you can do to make your MIL understand all of this, she probably just needs time.

What your MIL said to you was out of line. You\u2019re not erasing your daughter and she will forever live in your hearts, and the memories you pass on to Dylan of her in the future. You have a two bedroom home. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t make that Dylan\u2019s room. He may be one month old now but he can\u2019t stay in your bedroom forever. You\u2019re passing on Kacie\u2019s items to her baby brother. The memories with Kacie will always be there and there are memories still to be made with Dylan. I think your MIL needs to see a grief counselor to work through these feelings more than anything. She may have been very close to Kacie, but you and your husband were her parents. There\u2019s no right words in a loss like yours but there are wrong ones. Please don\u2019t let what your MIL said get in either of your heads, it was highly inappropriate and said out of strong emotions.", "NTA.\n\nThis must have been horrible for you to go through, and I'm sorry to hear what has happened. Evidently it has definitely affected your MIL heavily, yet her ideas for how your own child sleeps has absolutely nothing to do with her. What are you meant to do? Just leave an entire room lying around while your child shares a room with you for all of the foreseeable future? Of course, I can see where your MIL is coming from - just by too big of an extent. Try to tell her how Kacie will be treasured with you forever, but time will continue to move on.\nHope all goes well.", "NTA\n\nDeb is understandably emotional, she connected extra with Kacie because she was ill and frail \\[and her only granddaughter, I read now in a comment\\]. Her sorrow is valid. But the dead are dead, and the living matter more. To deny Dylan, also a baby, his own place in life, to have him live under the shadow of his sister who is not even alive, is cruel. You as a parent surely suffered the loss of your own baby more than Deb, but she is entitled to her sorrow, even if unreasonable. Be compassionate of her. To shun her out would make you TA.\n\nTry and appeal to Deb's protective and maternal side (that she clearly has) in favour of Dylan. How Dylan has lost his older sister and doesn't even know yet, but will surely be consoled to know how he got to grow up in his sister's room (and hence was always with her) once he is old enough to learn about Kacie.  Keep some of her sister's things (if not all), and point out to Ded how he loves that particular toy she bought for Kacie, as if he knew it was Kacie's. Ask Deb to tell Dylan about Kacie. Have Deb be an active part in keeping Kacie's memory alive, even asking her to confirm facts that you secretly know anyway (\"Deb, Kacie loved the Twinkle Star song, wasn't it? How does the song go again?\").", "NTA. You only have 2 bedrooms. The baby is going to need a bedroom. It\u2019s sad, I can\u2019t imagine losing a child, but needs must. Your MIL is acting irrationally, especially if she\u2019s still talking about your lost daughter as the best grandchild. I\u2019d be wary that she might avoid or shame your son for living when your daughter passed away.", "NTA. I'm not sure wtf she thinks you're supposed to do. Like, if you moved, you wouldn't set up a new room for your late daughter. She's certainly not being rational. Sorry for your loss. Happy about your son and glad it sounds like he's healthy!", "NTA", "NAH.  You need to use your home wisely and Dylan will need his own room.  It\u2019s gotta happen eventually.   You have had a chance to think it through and get used to the idea.  It is a hard thing fir you all.  \n\nThere seems to be no was to avoid the conflict you have with your MIL.    It seems to me she said some unreasonably hurtful things.  I do get that.  I also think that was grief talking.  She is not ready to make the changes and was likely shocked when you mentioned this.   I think that, if you can, forgiving her will be helpful.   Her reaction seems to be from anger, not judgement or hate.  \n\nThis is a tall order and a lot to ask.  However unless this is the \u201cstraw that broke the camels back\u201d it would be the best way to keep the relationship.   \n\nI am so sorry you are having to go through this.

Special blankets. Special toys and store them. But the rest there is no harm in letting brother use. \n\nYou can love your son and cherish him and still remember your daughter.", "NTA - This is about you and doing what's right for your immediate family. Doing right by your son does not equal doing wrong to the memory of your daughter. You cannot afford, nor are you required, to maintain a shrine to your late daughter for your MIL. Your MIL does not sound as though she has accepted her grandchild's death.", "I am so sorry for your sad loss. Clearly you loved Kacie very much. \n\nIt's wonderful that you have Dylan now and that you have this beautiful new opportunity to find joy in your lives as his parents. I understand MIL's grief, but she is really overstepping here. You are most definitely NTA for wanting to take the best care possible of your baby boy and make the best life for him. He absolutely should have that room.", "NTA. It's impossible for that room to stay a shrine for your daughter. You have a living son who will need a room. You only have two bedrooms. Your MIL is being unfair and unrealistic. \n\nI'm sure you love your daughter every bit as much as you love your son. But sadly, she's not here and he is and he will need a room.\n\nIt really sounds like your MIL needs therapy because this isn't a healthy way to grieve. She's throwing away a relationship with a living grandchild. And it sounds like you may need to protect your son from her if she cannot move past this and love and accept him. Do not let her become a hateful person in his life.", "NAH\n\nDeb was obviously very close to Kacie and I think it\u2019s very sweet that they had such a close relationship. Grief is complicated and I can definitely see how the sudden thought of putting Dylan in Kacie\u2019s room could have felt quite overwhelming and emotional.\n\nOf course packing away Kacie\u2019s things and making room for Dylan is necessary. I\u2019m sure after the emotions settle Deb will see that it\u2019s a reasonable option - this is just her immediate reaction to a heartbreaking situation. Kacie\u2019s room is a big piece left of her and I can definitely see how changing it can trigger feelings of erasure and heartache. Her outburst simply came from a place of love and sentimentality for your daughter. \n\nTry not to be too harsh on your MIL. She is grieving as I\u2019m sure you are too. Remind her that Kacie will (of course) always always be in your hearts. Perhaps when you change the room for Dylan you can put something up in Kacie\u2019s memory (a picture of her in the living space, a shelf of some of her favorite things or something else that\u2019s sentimental to her). \n\nLosing a child must be incredibly tough. It sounds like there\u2019s a lot of love in your family. Stick together and help each other through it as gently as you can. Grief can cloud our judgement at times.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss OP.", "I'm going to go with a NAH simply because your MIL's connection was so deep that she is having this strong of a reaction, she needs therapy to help her get over the grief. It's unreasonable to not use that room for your child when there are only two bedrooms. Plus, she doesn't get to decide what room is used for what in your own home. \n\nThere's no bias towards the child that is depending on you to survive, you are not trying to erase Kacie, and you don't hate Kacie. Your MIL is having a hard time dealing with, processing, and moving past her grief and she needs some help. Y'all are taking care of your son in the way y'all see fit.", "NTA. Ask her where she thinks your son's room should be. An outside shed? A garage? \n\nApparently you can't move, either, as that would be leaving her room to (gasp!) strangers!", "NAH--yet. OP, I am so very sorry for the loss of your daughter. There is absolutely nothing at all wrong with your husband and yourself deciding to put Dylan in the only other bedroom in the house, be it Kacie's old room or not. If you and your husband have come to a point where you are ready and comfortable with this transition then you should move ahead with it and not feel bad at all. The reason I feel that NAH is that grief affects everyone differently, and there should be room for compassion here. You and your husband have already been discussing this for a while but for your MIL it came up unexpectedly. She was close with Kacie and this move likely shook her because she loved her so much. Should she have behaved that way? No, of course not, but she was likely just in shock from having that grief would 'poked'. I would give her some space in order to sit with the new information so that she has time to come to terms with the fact. If she continues to behave this way and wants to punish you for what you've decided is best for your family, then she is definitely the AH, but considering she likely just felt a little blindsided by this information (warranted or not), that this is not her usual behaviour, and that her bond with Kacie was so strong, I would give her a chance to gather herself. At the end of the day, this is your family and your children, and you and your husband know what is best for everyone. Best of luck to all of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Awful!", "We knew before we had any children that Deb wanted a granddaughter (she has 5 sons, no daughters).", "I wonder if it\u2019s less about wanting it as a permanent monument, and more about it happening sooner than she expected. Like, maybe she thought that the new baby wouldn\u2019t need the room for another year or two, and the surprise caused her to freak out. \n\nNot an acceptable way to treat OP, but more understandable than an irrational desire to create a museum in a two bedroom home.", "This is fantastic advice, OP please do this", "Very well said \ud83d\udc9c", "That seems an unnecessarily cruel response to a grieving grandmother.  I think kindness and patience are a better way to go.", "Clearly, cut the room out of the house, load it on a truck and bring it with them. At least according to MIL.", "You definitely need to re-evaluate and protect Dylan from her, if necessary.", "Please watch her closely. I am not with her day to day. But it sounds like she resent him for being healthy and alive. Make sure she doesn\u2019t before you leave her alone with him. That is a lot of guilt and trauma to place on a child.\n\nAs much as you love your mil your child\u2019s emotional wellbeing has to come first. And if she is resenting him she does not need to be in his life no matter who\u2019s mother she is.", "Ofc, I hope you guys can figure it all out and MIL doesn\u2019t have any hard feeling about it all.", "Was this the story how thier mom even demanded them to name their unborn child after the sister. I have seen a few post like that. They are all heartbreaking.", "I sincerely hope she doesn\u2019t treat Dylan any differently because of this situation. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss; even though it was years ago, I know it can still be incredibly painful.", "BINGO!  That\u2019s why she is acting like she is.  She is angry that HER granddaughter is gone and she didn\u2019t want a grandson.  It is more important to her to grieve the loss of her granddaughter than to enjoy the new grandson.\n\nShe needs therapy as she is reacting very badly, and it sounds like she has been since the new baby arrived.\n\nPlease do not let your son near her until she gets therapy as you don\u2019t want her to make your son feel less than a sister he never met.", "First, I am sorry you are going through this and your loss.\n\n\nSecond, what your mil did goes deeper than originally thought. Her admitting she had a favorite grandchild is disturbing. That kind of outward favoritism will only lead to harm to any other grandchildren, including your son.\n\nYour first priority is to your son first and foremost. I would take steps away from her for the time being. It sounds like your husband agrees. \n\nI would never want my son to know he is loved less because of his gender or live in the shadow of his sister, who sadly never got the chance to grow up.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNta", "You're right...I likely got too carried away thinking of the other OP who grew up in the previous child's shadow.", "Not sure, quite likely. Some of them get mixed up my memory. The one I thought of...I recall they always had to share their birthday with the deceased sibling. Indeed, heartbreaking.\n\nAnd yes, the naming of unborn children is common even with living family who have behavioral and/or fertility issues."]}
