Everyone even remotely close to me knows this. \n\nI know my husband\u2019s likes and dislikes and when I pick up food if he\u2019s not with me he is always happy with what I bring him. I listen when he says he doesn\u2019t like mustard, vinegar, or pickles. He\u2019s not a seafood fan unless it\u2019s a certain kind of fish served a certain kind of way. He is a bit picky about food and if I\u2019m paying for our food I want to be sure he\u2019s going to like it.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have a lot of food at home so he decided to pick up Taco Bell (I know, I know) on the way home from work. I get paid tomorrow and we\u2019re basically broke until then. I asked for a bean burrito with no onions. I specified no onions twice. I also ordered this so he could get a bigger meal with the funds we had available.\n\nWhen we got home he handed me the burrito. I asked him if he specified no onions.. he didn\u2019t.

It wasn't a big one either.", "NTA - The least he could do was apologize and offer to rectify it by removing the onions. But he seems he couldn't care less, so you definitely have the right to be upset.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to be upset. I\u2019d ask your husband why he thinks his comfort is more important than yours, since he thinks you should have either starved quietly or eaten something disgusting (to you) so that he wouldn\u2019t have to know he made a mistake?", "As a FODMAP person and also someone who cannot stand the texture of onions then I would not be able to not want to eat them. He ignored your 13 years of not eating onions to get what he wants. Why would he be upset with you? He should be upset with himself for choosing not to tell them no onions.\n\nMany people prefer not to say anything for reasons of embarrassment or just not wanting to make a fuss. Use his own frame of reference and get him a burger next time with pickles and say that you thought he would be okay as you obviously were okay with onions right?\n\nSeriously, it is one thing to forget or decide not to say anything but to then get upset with your other half not eating something when you also get things like pickles taken off isn't something a partner does.\n\nI would eat lot of pickles from now.", "Did he apologise? \n\n\u201cShit babe, I totally forgot to say no onions, sorrryy\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to be decent. If it\u2019s a honest mistake on his part neither of you should be upset. \n\nAlso what did he get? Can\u2019t you have half of his and he takes the burrito?", "NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not for having food preferences or for being miffed that your order was wrong, but for taking it out of proportion and bringing it to the court of public opinion. Did you eat anything between the incident and posting the story? Were you just feeling hangry?", "You drew me in with the burrito incident.  Happy I'm here to read your awakening that you realized YTA, a small one. But in the world of onion hate, a small amount of onions is still too much onion. Ha! Pick yourself up and enjoy your mac and cheese, no onion.", "Of course you are NTA. A bean burrito no onions is one of my husband\u2019s standard Taco Bell orders. It\u2019s not a difficult request. Your husband didn\u2019t care enough to order what you wanted.", "I definitely should have specified that he absolutely did try to remove the onions (on a two dollar burrito) but it was kinda like an afterthought and I was already upset and I\u2019m still typing as I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019m more of the asshole than I let on initially.. ugh. He\u2019s a good guy and I\u2019m being dramatic.", "In his (minimal) defense, he usually does well when he brings me food. It was truly a mistake, not  something that happens regularly. But I\u2019m still hungry lol", "Same with FODMAPS. Why do they have to put garlic and onion in absolutely everything? Why? And people act like you\u2019re some inconvenient picky eater making a big fuss out of nothing if you politely try to ask what on a menu doesn\u2019t have them, or can at least be modified and made without them. Like, I\u2019m sorry that MY inability to digest certain foods is an inconvenience for YOU. But no matter how many times you say \u201cReally?? They taste so good, they\u2019re my favorite!\u201d it will not magically cure my legit health condition. Trust me, I wish it could more than you do. \ud83d\ude44", "I really appreciate your comment and also, RIGHT? The texture of onion is the worst. I just responded to someone else and actually realized I\u2019m the asshole. He has a momentary lapse and I flipped out. He simply forgot to omit onions and I went on Reddit to bitch about it. So imma apologize and make myself some Kraft Mac and cheese (with no onions)", "He totally did. With everyone saying I\u2019m not TAH I\u2019ve realized I totally am. I\u2019m also a vegetarian so I can\u2019t eat his stuff either. I\u2019m just hungry and grumpy. He just forgot to ask for no onions like any other human does sometimes. I\u2019m gonna make myself some food and get over myself lol", "You need to stop forgetting his requests too.", "Wait at the beginning you say that taking your food requests seriously isn't a strength of his, implying this is a regular thing of basically not caring.\n\nNow you say it's truly a mistake and he's normally good about it.\n\nAnd he tried to pick the onions out.\n\nCome on now.\n\nBeing disappointed cos you're still hungry is understandable.\n\nBut making this genuine mistake out to be a big enough deal to AITA about it? Hmmm well that probably makes you TA.", "That\u2019s probably what I should have posted about \u201cAITA\u201d for being mad about a bean burrito that comes FUCKING COVERED IN REHYDRATED CHOPPED ONIONS??", "You\u2019ve been together long enough that the no onion thing shouldn\u2019t have to be specified. Sure it\u2019s not dramatic but you have the right to be a bit upset.", "Hahahaa! Aawww! I\u2019ve had those moments of self reflection too! \n\nLike in the moment you\u2019re so convinced you\u2019re right, but it\u2019s totally cool to realise later on that, shit, I may be the bad guy here! \n\nHumans gotta human.

It was a hangry post looking for sympathy? I\u2019m def TA. I just wanted to bounce my feelings off other people that went involved.
