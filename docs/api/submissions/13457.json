It wasn't a big one either.", "NTA - The least he could do was apologize and offer to rectify it by removing the onions. But he seems he couldn't care less, so you definitely have the right to be upset.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to be upset. I\u2019d ask your husband why he thinks his comfort is more important than yours, since he thinks you should have either starved quietly or eaten something disgusting (to you) so that he wouldn\u2019t have to know he made a mistake?", "As a FODMAP person and also someone who cannot stand the texture of onions then I would not be able to not want to eat them. He ignored your 13 years of not eating onions to get what he wants. Why would he be upset with you? He should be upset with himself for choosing not to tell them no onions.\n\nMany people prefer not to say anything for reasons of embarrassment or just not wanting to make a fuss. Use his own frame of reference and get him a burger next time with pickles and say that you thought he would be okay as you obviously were okay with onions right?\n\nSeriously, it is one thing to forget or decide not to say anything but to then get upset with your other half not eating something when you also get things like pickles taken off isn't something a partner does.\n\nI would eat lot of pickles from now.", "Did he apologise? \n\n\u201cShit babe, I totally forgot to say no onions, sorrryy\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to be decent.

Not for having food preferences or for being miffed that your order was wrong, but for taking it out of proportion and bringing it to the court of public opinion. Did you eat anything between the incident and posting the story? Were you just feeling hangry?", "You drew me in with the burrito incident.  Happy I'm here to read your awakening that you realized YTA, a small one. But in the world of onion hate, a small amount of onions is still too much onion. Ha! Pick yourself up and enjoy your mac and cheese, no onion.", "Of course you are NTA. A bean burrito no onions is one of my husband\u2019s standard Taco Bell orders. It\u2019s not a difficult request.

He\u2019s a good guy and I\u2019m being dramatic.", "In his (minimal) defense, he usually does well when he brings me food. It was truly a mistake, not  something that happens regularly. But I\u2019m still hungry lol", "Same with FODMAPS. Why do they have to put garlic and onion in absolutely everything? Why? And people act like you\u2019re some inconvenient picky eater making a big fuss out of nothing if you politely try to ask what on a menu doesn\u2019t have them, or can at least be modified and made without them. Like, I\u2019m sorry that MY inability to digest certain foods is an inconvenience for YOU. But no matter how many times you say \u201cReally??

I just responded to someone else and actually realized I\u2019m the asshole. He has a momentary lapse and I flipped out. He simply forgot to omit onions and I went on Reddit to bitch about it. So imma apologize and make myself some Kraft Mac and cheese (with no onions)", "He totally did. With everyone saying I\u2019m not TAH I\u2019ve realized I totally am. I\u2019m also a vegetarian so I can\u2019t eat his stuff either. I\u2019m just hungry and grumpy. He just forgot to ask for no onions like any other human does sometimes. I\u2019m gonna make myself some food and get over myself lol", "[deleted]", "Wait at the beginning you say that taking your food requests seriously isn't a strength of his, implying this is a regular thing of basically not caring.\n\nNow you say it's truly a mistake and he's normally good about it.\n\nAnd he tried to pick the onions out.\n\nCome on now.\n\nBeing disappointed cos you're still hungry is understandable.\n\nBut making this genuine mistake out to be a big enough deal to AITA about it? Hmmm well that probably makes you TA.", "That\u2019s probably what I should have posted about \u201cAITA\u201d for being mad about a bean burrito that comes FUCKING COVERED IN REHYDRATED CHOPPED ONIONS??", "You\u2019ve been together long enough that the no onion thing shouldn\u2019t have to be specified.

She's not TA for having preferences but is TA for taking an honest mistake her partner tried to rectify, and blowing it out of proportion to come online and talking about how he doesn't take her needs seriously. Which she has since said was out of proportion and she was probably just hungry and acting out because of it.", "You have a right to be upset. He should know how to order a burrito for you. He needs a reminder of the food preferences he has that you remember each time.\n\nIf I order my husband nuggets from McDonald's instead or Wendy's then that's a mistake and he'll eat them and not say anything. If I order him a burger with Mayo instead of plain then that's a wtf. There's no way he'd eat that and would have a reason to be upset. It goes both ways for us too.", "I'm just trying to figure out when they started putting onions in the bean burritos \ud83d\ude02... You literally told him twice and he still \"forgot\" but somehow you've come to the conclusion that you're in the wrong ...

As a lifelong picky eater (no fish of any kind *ever*, and I can count the variety of veggies I'll eat on two hands and maybe a toe or two) I make sure to order my own food so there are no mess ups. The suggestion to use the website or app for ordering is a good one.

I once broke up with someone over a fray bentos pie - which isn't even a real pie NTA", "NTA it is a care thing, you care enough about him to remember his aversion to pickle, mustard and vinegar, but he just doesn't care enough to to worry about your onion aversion. It isn't high up on his priority list.", "You can\u2019t really remove the onions from a bean burrito. Even if you could get all the onions out you can still taste them!", "I think NTA, but you should always order using the app if you're a picky eater.\n\nIf a place has a way to order through a website or app, you can customize better and mishaps won't happen. Also, I specifically get items that have fewer customizations needed to fit my standards because the restaurant is less likely to mess up on their end.\n\nI haven't gotten the wrong food nearly as often since adopting this strategy."]}
