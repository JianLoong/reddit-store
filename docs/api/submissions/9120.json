He may have odd hours, but this isn't insurmountable. \n\nOr how about another trusted adult who aren't the kid's parents. \n\nYour son doesn't have any other recourse. His good friend is separated from him. You can help him know how his friend is doing (even say that friend is alert or pleased by the gifts). Tell your son he ate the pizza happily.

This friend is in a vulnerable place at the moment and might not anyone besides his parents/family visiting him.

I\u2019m sure his parents bringing along the gifts from your son would mean the world to this kid and nothing else is necessary. He needs space to heal.\n\nI\u2019m surprised by how many Y T A judgements there are because if I were in his friend\u2019s position I would not be comfortable with my friend\u2019s parent showing up in this context, even if it was my best friend\u2019s parent.

This is one of those times.", "Yikes. Against the grain but I\u2019m going NTA. Everyone here is seemingly not taking in account that most in patient psych wards don\u2019t allow visitors unless the parents ok it. Typically when the child is admitted, the parents have to sign paperwork stating who is able to visit and the psych ward isn\u2019t allowed to deviate from that list due to HIPPA regulations. Some might have different regulations for visitors, or allow people not listed to visit with the parents but it\u2019s dependent on the facility. If nothing else, he may be able to call and talk to his friend as there\u2019s usually a time when the patients can receive calls. Some clinics read any letters that are taken to the patient or sent from the patient, and some may even discuss the contents with the parents. OP, your son is allowed to ask, and you\u2019re allowed to say no for whatever reason. You should definitely explain your reasoning to him instead of \u201cbecause I said so\u201d, that can cause your son to lose trust in you. The best option I can give is to call the friend\u2019s parents and speak with them about any courses you can take to help your son reach out to his friend and let him know he cares and misses him.", "NTA. \n\nHis parents are going. You are not said friend\u2019s parents and don\u2019t have an obligation to go. If you are really close with said friend and treated him like your own when he was growing up, that maaay be a different story, but I would still run it by his parents before going. \n\nNot to mention that you going by yourself may be crossing a line, especially as an adult that is not his parent. \n\nTell the parents your son\u2019s concerns about opening the letter and have them assure him they won\u2019t betray his confidence. \n\nYou may even consider telling a white lie for his ease of mind, saying that only his family can go. \n\nBut no matter your reason for not feeling comfortable in going, the fact remains that you don\u2019t feel comfortable going. NTA", "YTA. You\u2019re son wants to see his sick friend in the hospital. Be a supportive parent and take him. Sure it will be awkward but you\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA. You have no business passing secret letters to a teen in an inpatient mental health facility. Or visiting. Kid you don\u2019t have a relationship with under those circumstances. I understand your son is upset, but this situation is above his, and your, pay scale.", "NTA no one should have to go into a mental treatment facility if they are not comfortable.  I freak out being behind locked doors. My psyc rotation was hell.", "NTA- I feel like this is crossing a line a bit. I would feel weird asking the parents of my son\u2019s friend to visit their child in an inpatient facility. Also, for the safety of the child, the staff will likely read whatever letter your son wants to give him anyway. I think you just need to explain to your son that his friend needs to focus on his treatment and it sounds like his parents haven\u2019t just abandoned him there.", "YTA, but it makes sense.  I wouldn't want to either.  It's an uncomfortable situation on its own, let alone having to hang out with a stranger, let ALONE it being a KID stranger.  It's an emotionally taxing situation I would also avoid.\n\nBut consider this: you don't have to stay.  If your kid asked you to drop something out at a friend's house, could you do that?  The hospital is more intense, and it feels socially wrong to just be in and out, but that IS a very real option (and, I believe, the most appropriate one.)\n\nYou could bring the things, stop in, give them to the kid, and have a greeting and get will wish prepared.  Just share hellos and well wishes and leave.  Something along the lines of \"Hey, I'm xyz's mom.  He asked me to deliver these.  I don't know what you're going through, but I want you to know that xyz, and our family, are here for you if you need anything.  Now I have to head to [work or other time sensitive exucse], so I'll be heading out.  Enjoy the pizza!\"  15 in and out max, and a lot of that would be travel time.\n\nUltimately, your child asked you to do this because he feels overwhelmingly powerless right now, and however you've raised him so far has led him to trust you as someone on his team that he can rely on for his most important, sensitive issues.  If you reject this, given how important it is to him, it may permanently damage this relationship and how he trusts in general.\n\nKeep in mind that this is probably about a lot more than a hospital visit.  If the friend is in the ward, there's a very high chance it's because they almost killed themselves.  To your kid, his friend is fighting for his life against something your kid has NO power to help with.  It's agonizing, it's terrifying.  These treats may seem to matter little, but for your kid, it's the only way he can try to protect or heal his friend.  If you deny that and insist on leaving him powerless, that will hurt him a lot more than I think you know.", "NAH.  \n\nThis is more one of those things that doesn\u2019t have a strong moral factor.  \n\nThe implications are more about what kind of person you want your son to see you as.\n\nA parent who can be trusted and counted on to go beyond what is expected and be supportive.  Or a parent who wouldn\u2019t bring his friend a comic and a letter because they didn\u2019t want to.", "NAH. As a person with mental issues, I don't want to go anywhere near hospitals period. You 'not wanting to' seems like there might be something to unpack there but I don't blame people for not wanting to be in those places. They have an aura of sickness and death", "A lot of people are calling you the *sshole.  I don\u2019t think you are.  First, my experience being in mental health facilities has been to only let certain of my immediate family in.  They find it disturbing to the other patients when a constant stream of people are visiting.  I also disagree with many of these people saying they would do this to make your son happy.  That is why we have so many entitled young people.  I don\u2019t understand why you have to give into every demand or request your child gives you. It is healthier to raise him to understand he can\u2019t gets what ever he wants.  \n\nI think it very easy for people to say you should go and give this kid emotional support.  It\u2019s easy to type when you\u2019re not in the situation.  It\u2019s nice to believe that but the reality of it is not what they think.  You WILL not be able to bring these things and it is doubtful the facility will even give you access.  Again, I have been in a few different ones and people have to be allowed to visit the patient.  You NEED to ask the parents to give the comic books and letter for their son to receive them.  A teenager understanding may not reflect the actual ability to achieve this . \n\nAgain, it\u2019s nice to want to immediately support this patient no matter the circumstances but every pne of you really don\u2019t care about what is appropriate for the patient.  From a very educated experience dealing with mental health issues, you all really don\u2019t understand that this is not a simple issue.  Please care more about what this patient is going through!  Please care about him as a living person and not a character in your savior fantasy.

I worked inpatient adolescence and any non family members had to be approved by guardian before visiting. \n\nI will say that those off unit visits were some of the best times for clients they get away for the unit and are able to social with friends/family while not being observed constantly. It was heartbreaking the kids that didn\u2019t ever have any visitors. A few times we would do a staff visit just so they could have that experience everyone else got. \n\nIn regards to snack check in with the unit/parents first. My program didn\u2019t allow any caffeine even in sodas, no metal pop cans, no metal eating utensils, glass ect.", "YTA, Welcome to parenthood bucko, you sometimes got to do stuff you're uncomfortable with.", "YTA if you don't go, and I can say with 100% certainty that this will be a defining moment for your relationship with your son. There are some things that even if you end up able to forgive, you can never forget and it changes the nature of the relationship entirely. He will always remember that you put being \"uncomfortable\" over trying to help his friend in a terrible situation. This clearly means a lot to him. What if you were in the hospital and had no one come visit because \"hospitals make them uncomfortable\"? I bet you'd feel pretty shitty.", "Wow. Way to be phobic about mental health. Can you imagine if his friend had cancer, and you \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel comfortable\u201d around chemo patients? YTA and so, so gross. It boggles my mind that there are wonderful people in the world who are struggling to conceive or adopt, while someone like you already has a kid.", "Man up you big baby and be there for your son.

OP, please consider driving your son to the facility.  Have him accompany you into the facility and wait in the lobby while you see his friend.  Don't take a pizza there maybe dietary restrictions.  Tell you son's friend you he's not allowed to visit and he's in the lobby.  You're dropping off a few things for your son. You hope he recovers and you wish him well.", "NTA\n\nI agree with many here that going would be the best thing to do, and it\u2019s what I would do, but despite what others think you ARE allowed to have your boundaries over your comfort. I would challenge you to think really deeply about this though. You are choosing to prioritize your comfort over your son\u2019s very clear request for your help in something incredibly important and personal to him. Who knows what\u2019s in his letter, but it\u2019s important enough that he\u2019s trusting you with it, and doesn\u2019t trust his friends parents with it. That\u2019s a big ass deal. So I\u2019d ask you just HOW uncomfortable with the hospital are you, really? Enough to be cool with you son feeling a bit betrayed by you?\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to have that boundary, but know that our boundaries have very real costs, and this one may have real consequences for the trust your son has in you.", "YTA - Fortunately your son is a better person than you.", "YTA", "YTA your son is probably going through a difficult time and he\u2019s asking for your support. Sometimes we have to do things we\u2019re not keen on doing for the people we love.", "If you don\u2019t know what to say, why not arrange to have your son on video call so he can talk to his friend?  Hospitals can be lonely places and having people visit and connections outside can help make a difference in treatment.", "YTA\n\nI definitely understand being uncomfortable, my bf spent time in a mental health ward and visiting him was stressful. \n\nBut I think you have an opportunity to show your son that you take mental health seriously, in particular men's mental health. Your son already sounds like a empathetic person, you would do him a great service to nurture that.", "YTA. Your discomfort is valid but the very least you could do is drop off the stuff and let friend know your son is thinking of him.", "YTA suck it up for your son. I did a stint in the psych ward when I was young and it was super hard and emotional. The only thing that made it bearable was visitors. Just talk to him, for god sakes he\u2019s a human not a vegetable.", "Doing things that aren't comfortable is a solid 95% of being a parent lol", "Saying the word \"Boundaries!\" doesn't magically make you not an AH.", "It\u2019s not in a parent\u2019s job description. Not if being uncomfortable is a legitimate concern. This is an extreme example to get the point across, but a lot of people would see red flags if a man was alone with a child that he doesn\u2019t know when no one else is around. I\u2019m sure this violates some sort of logical fallacy, but the OP doesn\u2019t have an obligation to go to the psych ward for any reason. \n\nShe can applaud her son for being concerned about his friend and having the emotional intelligence to know that said friend is in a tough spot, but that doesn\u2019t mean she ignores her own legitimate concerns.", "Or just drop the stuff and leave.

Wouldn\u2019t be my first choice of how to spend an hour or two of my day, but if a kid was in need, I would do it. If my kid was in need of doing something to help, but it was outside of their control, I would do it. I would bring something that was just from me, too. And I would offer a mom hug. \n\nI can imagine all the ways this might feel uncomfortable or scary, especially because mental health is so stigmatized. I beg the question: OP, if this friend had a something hospital confining like cancer or something, and your kid asked you to do the same, would you do it?", "People on this sub think they can act any way they want as long as they say the word \"Boundaries!\"", "Also it's not like OP has to sit in silence. Just leave the stuff and excuse themselves. Or tell then news about OPs son if the kid asks.", ">  Also, for the safety of the child, the staff will likely read whatever letter your son wants to give him anyway. \n\nEven if that's true, it's very different having some random staffer read it than his friend's parents.", "Those aren't the issues being raised. OP, TA, isn't saying they _can't_ do this because of rules or a bigger picture their kid can't see. OP is TA because they're saying they _won't_ do this small thing, dropping off a few things that their kid isn't allowed to drop off because OP _doesn't want to_. There's a world's difference there. \n\nOP isn't willing to try to drop off something, a TINY ask, because they're not \"comfortable\" going to a hospital.

I think this is a very helpful comment.", "That\u2019s a great idea.  None of us know the patient\u2019s situation.  If the doctor thinks it would be helpful, that sounds like a great solution.  I don\u2019t know the budget of this psych facility, they are usually under staffed and leads to a lack of caring to the best interests of the patients.  I speak from personal experience as a patient of various psych wards. I really like your idea!  With all the technology we have, that would simple.  We have absolutely no access to our phones but they should allow that.  It is barely any work to unlock the cabinet.  I would love for that be instituted!", "Unless there's some really big reason why OP doesn't want to go, is stopping by a psych ward to drop some stuff off really that big of a deal? The son isn't asking OP to be there for hours and make friends, but to do a delivery. A psych ward is not a place to be scared of.\n\nIf OP left something big out, maybe, but as stated what's the big deal? It's a safe location and the son just wants to have someone close to them show they care.", "What legitimate concern? \n\nI'm sorry, but \"the people in the mental health ward give me the ick\" vibe is not a concern. \n\nYou are aware that a vast majority of people in the psych ward are young and struggling with suicidal ideation, and maybe receiving a letter and care package from their friend that can't visit them could aid in their recovery?  \n\nAt the bare minimum the things can be left at the nurses station. Wow, what amazing solutions just a small amount of critical thinking can accomplish. \n\nYou and OP just oooooze mental health phobia. Jesus.", ">red flags if a man was alone with a child that he doesn\u2019t know when no one else is around.\n\nBut OP won't be alone...it's a mental health ward.

Surely the sire must consider the humanity of taking on such a harrowing journey!", "Perhaps, but depending on what\u2019s in the letter it will be reported to the parents anyway. It concerns me a bit that OPs son is being somewhat secretive about the letter. Having worked in this environment before, this visit probably wouldn\u2019t have been approved as INP treatment is pretty intense and generally visitors are limited to immediate family.", "I understand the issue of her simply not wanting to go.  Thanks for reminding me.  I think it is a valid reason.  The reason I wrote my comment is because so many people are saying she can just do this supposedly easy thing.  It really is a lack of trying to understand the reality of what the her son is asking and how it affects his friend.  He seems to be a sweet boy and a very caring friend, commenters are focused too much on that .  I wanted to explain that they need to think about how this would probably affect the patient.  Her just not wanting to do this doesn\u2019t matter. The commenters need to stop and think about the all the issues.  It\u2019s easy to type a well intended comment but they sound angry without understanding the complexity of the actual situation.  She really can\u2019t do what they are telling her to do.  I wanted to help people understand that.  I have been dealing with mental health issues my entire life and my experiences in several different faculties can be helpful to people over simplifying the situation. They need to understand her son\u2019s request maybe more damaging than helping.  I know that aspect of the story is not the main focus at all.  But a lot of people are reacting to the patient\u2019s situation instead of focusing on her reasons. \n\nShe is asking for opinions and she is getting people\u2019s perspectives.  She may sound selfish but asking for advice.  I think people are ignoring that.  That is a thing that shows she does care and is willing to handle this situation better.  Or help change her perspective.  She put herself out there and that should be respected.  I know Reddit is not the best place to get good advice and for people to comment anything they want.   I don\u2019t care about this thread really, it just bothers me that people are over simplifying the situation. I just wanted to give my experience and hope people reflect on it.\n\nI really appreciate your comment and it gave me pause to think.  Thanks for reminding me about that important aspect of the story.  It is the main issue at hand. I really do feel my comment is valid.

I\u2019m not saying that OP is going to be alone with the child. What I am saying is that it still might be inappropriate for reasons not clear in the post.", "But it might be UNCOMFORTABLE for OP. Because I am sure that the 15 year old that ended up as a psych inpatient is having the time of his life.", "I gotra disagree.  It seems normal to me for any teen, especially one who is in a mental health ward and may have some issues at home, to be worried about their parents hearing them talk about it.  A lot of parents get very defensive when their kid has complaints about them- one of my close friends was raised in a household with strict \"you are never allowed to talk to people about what happens at home\" rules.  If her parents found out she'd, say, confided in a friend that she had gotten into an argument wirh her mom, and any of the family found out, they would all gang up on her for \"snitching.\"\n\nHospital staff are generally well trained to tell whether or not a parent needs to be notified of the contents in a letter, and probably won't do anything if the letter mentions normal family trouble.  But a parent might get defensive and start a fight about \"why did you tell your friend I was mean, I'm not mean!!!\"", "Is it really so hard to drop some stuff off and tell him what his friend is up to?
