You can make it clear that you're just dropping off stuff on behalf of your son and sending regards.\n\nIf you don't like mental care facilities as a whole, then I think you ought push having your husband go. He may have odd hours, but this isn't insurmountable. \n\nOr how about another trusted adult who aren't the kid's parents. \n\nYour son doesn't have any other recourse. His good friend is separated from him. You can help him know how his friend is doing (even say that friend is alert or pleased by the gifts). Tell your son he ate the pizza happily.

But I feel that his solution of you going in his place is inappropriate, and putting you (and potentially his friend) in an uncomfortable position.\n\nI would be very uncomfortable if someone\u2019s parent showed up at my impatient facility and wanted to see me. This friend is in a vulnerable place at the moment and might not anyone besides his parents/family visiting him. (as his friends can\u2019t) It certainly isn\u2019t a normal thing to do, and you being uncomfortable in that environment would probably make it awkward even if he was ok with parents of friends visiting. I\u2019m sure his parents bringing along the gifts from your son would mean the world to this kid and nothing else is necessary. He needs space to heal.\n\nI\u2019m surprised by how many Y T A judgements there are because if I were in his friend\u2019s position I would not be comfortable with my friend\u2019s parent showing up in this context, even if it was my best friend\u2019s parent.

When kids are having a hard time, a good rule of thumb is to treat them the way you would hope another adult would treat your child in the same situation.

This could mean the world to his friend.", "YTA. Your son can\u2019t see his friend, and just wants to be there for him. You can suck up a little discomfort and be there for him in this really difficult time. He can\u2019t communicate with his friend in crisis, I think you can understand how that feels. To ignore that over some discomfort is selfish and childish, and I\u2019m sure is rooted in some shit views on mental health wards. \n\nI\u2019m sure Reddit is going to disagree with me, so let me just say this\u2026 this is one of those \u201cin the real world people would think you\u2019re an asshole\u201d situations.", "YTA.\nSometimes doing the right thing is difficult. This is one of those times.", "Yikes. Against the grain but I\u2019m going NTA. Everyone here is seemingly not taking in account that most in patient psych wards don\u2019t allow visitors unless the parents ok it. Typically when the child is admitted, the parents have to sign paperwork stating who is able to visit and the psych ward isn\u2019t allowed to deviate from that list due to HIPPA regulations. Some might have different regulations for visitors, or allow people not listed to visit with the parents but it\u2019s dependent on the facility. If nothing else, he may be able to call and talk to his friend as there\u2019s usually a time when the patients can receive calls. Some clinics read any letters that are taken to the patient or sent from the patient, and some may even discuss the contents with the parents. OP, your son is allowed to ask, and you\u2019re allowed to say no for whatever reason. You should definitely explain your reasoning to him instead of \u201cbecause I said so\u201d, that can cause your son to lose trust in you. The best option I can give is to call the friend\u2019s parents and speak with them about any courses you can take to help your son reach out to his friend and let him know he cares and misses him.", "NTA. \n\nHis parents are going. You are not said friend\u2019s parents and don\u2019t have an obligation to go. If you are really close with said friend and treated him like your own when he was growing up, that maaay be a different story, but I would still run it by his parents before going. \n\nNot to mention that you going by yourself may be crossing a line, especially as an adult that is not his parent. \n\nTell the parents your son\u2019s concerns about opening the letter and have them assure him they won\u2019t betray his confidence. \n\nYou may even consider telling a white lie for his ease of mind, saying that only his family can go. \n\nBut no matter your reason for not feeling comfortable in going, the fact remains that you don\u2019t feel comfortable going. NTA", "YTA. You\u2019re son wants to see his sick friend in the hospital. Be a supportive parent and take him. Sure it will be awkward but you\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA. You have no business passing secret letters to a teen in an inpatient mental health facility. Or visiting. Kid you don\u2019t have a relationship with under those circumstances. I understand your son is upset, but this situation is above his, and your, pay scale.", "NTA no one should have to go into a mental treatment facility if they are not comfortable.  I freak out being behind locked doors. My psyc rotation was hell.", "NTA- I feel like this is crossing a line a bit. I would feel weird asking the parents of my son\u2019s friend to visit their child in an inpatient facility. Also, for the safety of the child, the staff will likely read whatever letter your son wants to give him anyway. I think you just need to explain to your son that his friend needs to focus on his treatment and it sounds like his parents haven\u2019t just abandoned him there.", "YTA, but it makes sense.  I wouldn't want to either.  It's an uncomfortable situation on its own, let alone having to hang out with a stranger, let ALONE it being a KID stranger.  It's an emotionally taxing situation I would also avoid.\n\nBut consider this: you don't have to stay.  If your kid asked you to drop something out at a friend's house, could you do that?  The hospital is more intense, and it feels socially wrong to just be in and out, but that IS a very real option (and, I believe, the most appropriate one.)\n\nYou could bring the things, stop in, give them to the kid, and have a greeting and get will wish prepared.  Just share hellos and well wishes and leave.  Something along the lines of \"Hey, I'm xyz's mom.  He asked me to deliver these.  I don't know what you're going through, but I want you to know that xyz, and our family, are here for you if you need anything.  Now I have to head to [work or other time sensitive exucse], so I'll be heading out.  Enjoy the pizza!\"  15 in and out max, and a lot of that would be travel time.\n\nUltimately, your child asked you to do this because he feels overwhelmingly powerless right now, and however you've raised him so far has led him to trust you as someone on his team that he can rely on for his most important, sensitive issues.  If you reject this, given how important it is to him, it may permanently damage this relationship and how he trusts in general.\n\nKeep in mind that this is probably about a lot more than a hospital visit.  If the friend is in the ward, there's a very high chance it's because they almost killed themselves.  To your kid, his friend is fighting for his life against something your kid has NO power to help with.  It's agonizing, it's terrifying.  These treats may seem to matter little, but for your kid, it's the only way he can try to protect or heal his friend.  If you deny that and insist on leaving him powerless, that will hurt him a lot more than I think you know.", "NAH.  \n\nThis is more one of those things that doesn\u2019t have a strong moral factor.  \n\nThe implications are more about what kind of person you want your son to see you as.\n\nA parent who can be trusted and counted on to go beyond what is expected and be supportive.  Or a parent who wouldn\u2019t bring his friend a comic and a letter because they didn\u2019t want to.", "NAH. As a person with mental issues, I don't want to go anywhere near hospitals period. You 'not wanting to' seems like there might be something to unpack there but I don't blame people for not wanting to be in those places. They have an aura of sickness and death", "A lot of people are calling you the *sshole.  I don\u2019t think you are.  First, my experience being in mental health facilities has been to only let certain of my immediate family in.  They find it disturbing to the other patients when a constant stream of people are visiting.  I also disagree with many of these people saying they would do this to make your son happy.  That is why we have so many entitled young people.  I don\u2019t understand why you have to give into every demand or request your child gives you. It is healthier to raise him to understand he can\u2019t gets what ever he wants.  \n\nI think it very easy for people to say you should go and give this kid emotional support.  It\u2019s easy to type when you\u2019re not in the situation.  It\u2019s nice to believe that but the reality of it is not what they think.  You WILL not be able to bring these things and it is doubtful the facility will even give you access.  Again, I have been in a few different ones and people have to be allowed to visit the patient.  You NEED to ask the parents to give the comic books and letter for their son to receive them.  A teenager understanding may not reflect the actual ability to achieve this . \n\nAgain, it\u2019s nice to want to immediately support this patient no matter the circumstances but every pne of you really don\u2019t care about what is appropriate for the patient.  From a very educated experience dealing with mental health issues, you all really don\u2019t understand that this is not a simple issue.  Please care more about what this patient is going through!  Please care about him as a living person and not a character in your savior fantasy.

I can get why you would be uncomfortable, especially if this is a friend you don\u2019t know well or haven\u2019t met. \n\nYou need to get past your discomfort. Your kid needs you to do this. I have teenagers and I haven\u2019t completely forgotten what it was like to be a teen. He will never forget it if you let him down here.

I see now that your son can\u2019t go at all, even if you are there. Still, I think a quick visit just to say hello, let him know your son wishes he could be there with him and wanted you to deliver some food he enjoys, is not a big ask. Again, unless there is some personal trauma which would truly make it a hardship for you, I find it really rude that you aren\u2019t supporting your son. There is so much stigma around mental health, even in 2023. \n\nI remember, over 15 years ago my father got a knock on the door after dinner and asked if their son (12) could stay at our house for the night. Our neighbors explained that they had to take his older brother (15) for inpatient mental health care and they had no where to bring the younger brother.

I'm going to give you some perspective from someone who's visited my sister in these places. These places are terrifying to the people inside. Some of the patients are WAY worse than the person you're visiting. Just people talking to things that aren't there, violent screaming and outbursts, workers that have gone numb to it, and only do something when the patient does something that disrupts THEMSELVES, all day, and all night. It's terrifying to the patients that aren't as far gone, and for a CHILD, poor baby. Mental illness can happen to anyone, at anytime, including YOUR child. This can happen to YOU. \n\nTo take away the mystery of being a visitor, I walked in, gave my ID, got my picture taken, everything I brought was searched. It was like I was visiting someone in prison. Some of them WERE criminally insane, so, that would do it. All my belongings were put in a locker. When my name was called, I went to a room where my sister joined me. We chat, she eats the snacks, time's up, I leave. Everything is locked tight, so no interaction with the more gone patients. It's not so bad.\n\nI'm actually surprised they'd let you bring outside food, I'd call and ask, but if you CAN, you SHOULD. If you're worried about what to talk about, talk about normal shit. Keep it light. Bring books, shit can get boring in there, too.\n\nPlease do it. You're son will think your a super hero and the child will think you're an angel, they'd be correct.

I say this as a Mom and I would feel a certain way if another kid wanted to pass a letter to my child in a fragile mental state that he was afraid of me seeing. To me that is a red flag. You have no idea why your sons friend is in there and if that letter would have a positive or negative effect because he wants to hide it. His friend has mental health issues and I would be concerned as the mother of his friend if there was anything that would trigger my child\u2019s mental state. It\u2019s the secrecy that concerns me. What if that letter says something that would harm his friends mental state?

There's nothing to indicate she was rude to her child or harsh.  Just that she said no.", "It was her reason for not going -- that she would be \"uncomfortable\" without giving any reason why that would be.  Her son wants to do a kind thing for a friend and needs her help, but she is wrapped up in anticipated discomfort.  The son has good reason to be disappointed in OP.\n\nNow, if OP couldn't visit because of regulations, that is a separate issue.", "YTA, the least you could do is reach out to the kids parents to pass along the kindness your son is trying to provide his friend!", "Pretty good solution OP.  \ud83e\udee1", "It's not clear enough to answer. \n\nIs just a mild discomfort? Some kind of anxiety?\n\nI know people that will go to a really bad place if they went to a mental health ward. is this the case for you? \n\nI don't give a judgment, but you really need to think why this is bothering you.", "YTA your son is asking for help with something he literally is not allowed to do himself. his friend is in a hard place and he just really wants to support and be there for him. he can only do that through you currently. Would it really be that difficult to put on a smile and converse with the kid, even if it\u2019s just for your son?", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you have a solution to the problem but in all honesty I don\u2019t see how you could be TA. If you\u2019re uncomfortable in the situation so be it. That whole thing about being a parent meaning you have to sacrifice your comfort goes as far as sacrificing sleep and having to stand up for your child. But this situation does not fall in the same category. People are allowed to be uncomfortable in situations like this and your son needs to know not to push you like that.  Very disrespectful.", "I can understand why you don't want to go. Being someone's parent and sitting there awkwardly not knowing the kid very well is awkward as hell and that's even if mental institution isn't involved. \n\nBut unfortunately given the situation, I think you're gonna be guilted into it since your son really wants to go and isn't allowed and you're it for the option. \n\nI might suggest talking to the kid's parents about the whole situation, though.", "YTA majorly.  Is there a reason for this?  Boundaries are one thing but unless you have a reason, it seems random and like you don't like psychiatric hospitals.

Being uncomfortable isnt a good reason", "If his parents go most days then why don\u2019t you coordinate for you and your son to meet them in the parking lot of the facility beforehand and give them the things your son wants you to pass along?", "NTA\nWill you provide an update, please. Good luck to everyone involved.", "yeah, YTA. i would also feel uncomfortable and i personally have medical trauma just to add to the discomfort, and i wouldnt like it, but i would go. let the kid eat some pizza and think about his friend. maybe ask your kid if he maybe has some subjects you could talk about with him/questions he may have for him, maybe even a YouTube video he'd like to show him if the hospital allows phones during visits. dropping the stuff off and leaving is also a good option. maybe comfort this 15 year old whos in a crisis. lots of options, yet the one you chose was to let both your son and his friend down in a time of need, because the alternative wouldve been \"uncomfortable\" for you.", "I worked at an inpatient facility for a while and you couldn't visit or even call patients without a password the parents picked out.

Your son is 100% right in seeing this as proof that he can't trust your word unconditionally.  I  do see in your edit that you are going to see about visiting and face timing,  which is great but it's not going to undo the damage already done", "And the update really makes OP seem like an AH, while they did arrive at a very reasonable compromise based on suggestions, somehow they seem pissed at the comments they received on this forum.

No one has to go anywhere for someone if it makes them uncomfortable.", "Only 95%?", "Idk, I didn't read it as her being judgemental that he's in a mental health ward, more like it feels like a private and intimate setting and she just doesn't know this boy like that. She mentions not knowing what they would talk about or do, I can understand not wanting to be your son's proxy for a one on one conversation with his best friend. It also might be really out of her way and take up a lot of her time to do something she finds to be deeply awkward, which makes her want to do it even less because it will be a lot of time feeling awkward instead of only a moment of awkwardness.\n\nBased on the edit, it seems like the thing that makes her comfortable with the new plan is that her son will be entertaining his friend during this one-on-one meeting and she won't have to come up with conversation; she doesn't seem to have a problem going to the hospital or the mental health ward.", "I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d feel comfortable visiting an underaged patient without their parents\u2019 consent either.

It sounds like a wonderful idea to FaceTime.

It is a good example to your child.  They do what they see their parents do.", "YTA.\n\nAt the end of the day, this isn't actually about you.

You are helping both your son and his friend by doing so. Good job!!", "NTA. I disagree with all the posts saying it's part of being a parent. No, no, it's not. Sometimes, the answer to things is no, and that does not change just because your child asked.", "Yeah. I'm really surprised (well.... not too surprised) at the responses here.

It could be anyone on an approved list.", "Shit I\u2019d do this for a kid I\u2019d never met or heard of if I was asked.

This idea that she would just be sitting there watching him eat pizza is so wildly ridiculous.

No clue what it was like before that, as that was our first time there.", "Every single time I go see my doctor, whom I adore, my pulse skyrockets. My resting heart rate is already high but it jumps like I\u2019m running a marathon even though I haven\u2019t been legitimately afraid of doctors since I was a kid. But that pretty much only happens when I\u2019m there for me. If I\u2019m in a hospital or Dr office for someone else, no problem.

The ward was not authorized to kids under 15. It has never been an issue as I felt really bad for this poor girl who was suffering so much. I became with her grand mother (who is as great as the parents are shitty) and some nurses and was able to \u201csmuggle\u201d my daughter and some other friends to visit thanks to them. \nAs long as you don\u2019t interfere in family life or medical treatment and just provide authorized food, school work and gift from friends, there is no issue for me. I always kept my opinions to myself, even when the grandma shared with me that she was disappointed by her son and DIL (the grandmother was visiting almost everyday and bringing meals). \nDiscussing with the nurse made me understand how difficult it was for the children and why it was good for them to get visitors and news from their friends.\nNote that she was so often at the hospital that the 1st time, when I ended up in the ER because I was lost in the hospital, they knew who she was with just her first name! It made me so sad for her.", "I have no idea where all the ridiculous YTA people are coming from, and I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this, but NAH. I've been through one of those facilities as a minor before so I know firsthand how much it sucks to be in there.\n\nThat being said it is not your kid. I get that your son wants to help his friend and isn't able so he's asking you to do it for him, but that's not your kid and you have no obligation to do so. Screw all the \"uncomfortable\" nonsense. Yeah it'd be nice if you went, but not going in there doesn't make you an AH, it just means you don't feel a responsibility to a kid that isn't yours (which you have every right to feel). If he was in rehab or juvie or a mental health facility like he is now, you'd be right to feel compassion for the kid but to feel a responsibility to help take care of him? Nah, get out of here with that. I get your son's feeling of anger, he feels powerless when he wants to help his friend and thinks that you should do it because he wants you to. But that's not how the world works.\n\nOffer your son a day/weekend to spend with his friend when he's released. It'd be easier for your son to support his friend when it's in a familiar environment and not done by proxy.\n\nI hope your son's friend is able to get the help he needs. It sounds like he already has a good support system with your son.", "I saw your edit and I think it's amazing that you are going to do that for your son. I hope his friend is doing ok and getting whatever help he needs. Your son has a good heart for doing that for his friend too, it proves to his friend that no matter what happens your son has his back and will not abandon him in a time like this.", "NAH- There is no way you are getting on that ward without prior consent from the parents and the son's treatment team. Everything you bring will be searched and checked. Likely no comics if they have staples. Your son's heart is in the right place but there are rules for these types of situations. It's for the patients protection.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand why you would be. People are allowed to have boundaries. It is good of you to go anyway, but you shouldn't feel obligated to do that. Sorry you're getting such negative feedback.", "I worked in an IRTS (intensive residential treatment support) program for adolescents. They only allowed immediate family members on the unit and had an extensive search process when gifts were going into the program. The comics would probably get flagged because they have staples in them. The facility would need to notify the friends parents about the visit. There is no \u201cprivacy\u201d in a psych ward, so if the son isn\u2019t comfortable with the parents reading his letter, he best be prepared for when the treatment team is doing so. It\u2019s wild to me that OP\u2019s son actually thinks that they\u2019d let his mom in to see a friend without it being an issue.\n\nA nice thing for OP to do would be to call the family and invite them to dinner once their child is discharged from the hospital. It\u2019s not appropriate for her to show up to visit the son\u2019s friend on his behalf.", "It's called White Coat Hypertension. It can be serious and lead to increased heart disease.

You could have even just gone to the main desk at the entrance to the wards/hospital and hand things over for patients, just give their name and ward. I think it\u2019s more about your son being able to find out how his friend really is as well as the friend knowing your sons trying to be there for him.   \nWhat normally happens when you actually  visit is you pre book your visit and sign in at the entrance before being buzzed in and escorted to a private visiting room. He will then be brought into it and you can both sit and talk privately. It\u2019s unusual for you to be allowed to mingle in the wards common room with other patients. You are normally given an hour but can leave sooner whenever you want. Just treat him normally and like you would treat your own son or want others to treat him in this situation.  Depending on what stage he is in his treatment they may give him permission to go outside the ward with you, if you\u2019re ok with that, just to the buildings cafe or gardens. Which might make the time pass easier but they\u2019d only do it if they think he\u2019s ready and it\u2019s safe and if you felt comfortable with it.", "NTA. Your son is being a little unreasonable here. I think it\u2019s great he cares so much for his friend and wants to make sure he has a treat. But he needs to respect you, as well, and your not wanting to go isn\u2019t \u201cjudging\u201d his friend. Perhaps your son could ask the friend\u2019s parents to take the letter/comics, as you suggested, as well as your son asking them if they\u2019d mind bringing a pizza from him and giving them the money for it? (I haven\u2019t been in a mental ward, but I have been in the hospital a lot from babyhood and having my mom come in with a treat and saying \u201cthis is from x friend\u201d was still pretty special)", "You were the A, and I\u2019m glad you reconsidered and figured out a solution.", "damn as a kid who was in a mental hospital a bunch due too, n abusive home life I wish I had a friend want to visit me, you visiting him for your son in his place can legit make his day and be the 1 good thing out of a shitty event.

Secondly, the staff is not going to be thrilled about you hooking up this kid and your son without some oversight.  \n\nI won't jump to YTA but I think your behavior needs some explanation.  Are you afraid of mental hospitals?  The people in them?  Are you worried about the relationship your son has with the hospitalized young man?  \n\nIf none of the above are true, I think you might be the AH.  This kid is obviously close to your son and your son wants to do him a kindness and his barrier to this is....you?

No judgement.", "Responding only to the update: if the facility your son's friend is in has similar rules to the one I work at, you won't be allowed to use your phone during the visit.

I went everyday for a month (it was a 2 hour drive, 1 hour there, 1 hour back).

We obviously don\u2019t know how uncomfortable OP is, whether just some mild anxiety and annoyance or if it\u2019s crippling.  If it\u2019s what I can imagine, it\u2019s probably pretty bad.\n\nI have diagnosed OCD, I am literally just some bad episodes away from being one of those patients getting treated, and I absolutely without question do not blame OP for not wanting to go.  If you don\u2019t handle the environment well it can be extremely unsettling.  It\u2019s not all unicorns and roses in many of those wards, they can be very depressing and for some very scary, such as myself.  I have been to the one in my city for work (not as a patient), and just walking up to the door was panic attack inducing for me.  No one wants to be there.  I was very lucky they didn\u2019t ask me to go out on the patient floor or I would have quit on the spot.\n\nThis would be akin to asking someone with claustrophobia to take a tool to the plumber in the crawlspace.

She actually listened.", "NTA lol\n\nwhy msut you go visit your son's friend, regardless of whether they were instituionalized or not. that makes no sense at all. and why would you keep stuff from the son's friend's parents anyway. that doesnt sound at all conducive for someone with mental health issues.", "Are you 100% sure you are even allowed to visit? I used to work at our local hospital and the psych ward was really particular about who could visit, especially the children\u2019s ward.
