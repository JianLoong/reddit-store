You don\u2019t deserve to have to work harder because he made a choice to do this and make less money. Stop the OT entirely, have him get a second job or talk to his parents. His parents need to honor their commitment and offer or let your husband leave.", "NTA.  Your husband's first responsibility is to his child and spouse, not his parents.  He needs to take a well paying job in order to provide for his family.", "I feel for you here. We were in the same boat but it wasn\u2019t a new business. Husband wasted 15 years trying to help his parents by running their small business. He literally ran the whole thing. When the business was no longer sustainable, (obsolete software) and he tried to find a job elsewhere he was totally screwed. So small he was only managing like 2 other people so when he applied for corporate management jobs he didn\u2019t get them, when he applied for tech sales jobs he didn\u2019t get those either because their sales were bad and declining (again, obsolete product) so his sales track record was terrible. (He had been a hot shot tech sales guy before he went to work for his parents.). And No one wants a 40 year old entry level person so he couldn\u2019t start over in the industry. \n\nHe ended up having to take a huge step backwards money wise and switch careers to one he hates - and we never recovered. He totally flushed his career down the toilet trying to help his parents. At one point about 7 years in he told his dad he thought this was bad for his career and he feels like he needs to leave but he is afraid he would take it personally - dad\u2019s response \u201cI would\u201d - so my husband stayed. Your hubby needs to get out now and they can hire someone else or do it themselves. Run!!", "NTA.  You and your husband are getting into debt, which you (presumably) wouldn't if he were making $8 more per hour.  So, basically, the business is dependent on pushing debt onto you and your husband.    \n\n\nIt's time for your husband and his parents to have a new agreement.  They need to pay him more per hour.  They need to investigate taking out a small business loan (which would probably be at a lower interest rate than your credit cards!).  \n\n\nIf the business is not able to pay him an acceptable wage, then he needs to get back into another job.  He can give them one month of notice, and they can pay someone else, and see how that goes.", "NTA but you have a husband problem, not an in-law problem. He took a pay cut to go into business with family, which is a horrible idea, and is digging in deeper at your own family\u2019s expense rather than fixing the situation he put you in.", "NTA\n\nIf he is doing the majority of the work running the business why doesn't he just quit and start up an identical one?  \n\nSeems like they are using him if they are hardly doing anything and paying him such a low wage.", "I have no idea if the family business is profitable and can afford to pay your husband more.\n\nBut your family-your nuclear family-is struggling. And your husband has options. He could return to his former employers, with a *raise*.Or he can stay and be overworked and underpaid. Or the family business can pay your husband more and he can stay.\n\nIt sounds like it is time for your husband to have an uncomfortable talk with his parents. They had a business before he worked for them. They can *continue* to have a business if your husband leaves them.

He needs to put on his big boy pants and talk to his parents or go back to his old job. I can't even imagine the stress this is putting on the two of you. Maybe all four of you should sit down together and make a plan\n\n He also should be part owner of this company not just an employee if he is doing 85% of the work.  You two can do this - they can't manage the business without him. Present a united front and demand what he (you both) deserve.", "You do realize his pay isn't $20 an hour, it's less than $16, right? He's working at least 48hrs a week, probably more, but being paid for 40. \n\nYou need to level with your husband. How long are you willing to stay in this situation, where you have to work two jobs to dig yourself out of debt, while his parents reap the benefits? 1 year? 5 years? 10 years? Ultimatums are relationship killers, but so is working 50-60hrs a week with a newborn and a husband without a spine.", "Technically E S H, but for official purposes, I'll say NTA.\n\nTechnically, you're doing exactly what you're unhappy with him about, just in a smaller amount. You said it yourself.\n\n>i also help with the business **for free** and do most of their book keepings [emphasis added]\n\nStop doing that. You need to either get paid for your work for the business, or stop working for them altogether. No pay, no work. And don't let it be a pittance either.\n\nI give you the official NTA because you are right that there is a problem and that things need to change.\n\nYou've talked about the issue, and shown him their numbers, but he doesn't seem to get it yet. Is it possible that you haven't painted a full enough picture yet? Maybe you need to do so.\n\nConsider doing the following:\n\n1.) Go through your ILs books to figure out how much of a raise they can realistically provide your husband. Part of it is the question of \"can they match the offer from his old job\". But it is also \"what is the upper limit with their current gross income\". This will help with the other part.\n\n2.) Work up your household budget. But don't just do an average monthly expenses thing. Project it out for a full year. Essentially an estimate for how much money you can expect to spend on living expenses, etc. over the next year.\n\nThen run up the numbers for the various income scenarios. How much you'll have coming in the next year with your income, his current pay, the other job, how much of a raise you could get from his parents, etc.\n\nWhat you should be able to end up with is numbers for how much you'll be in the hole or ahead for each of those scenarios.\n\nYou know the current situation is untenable. This will help show how bad it is. What the rest of it will show is which options are actually realistic, and which direction you should be going.\n\nIt will also give you numbers for how much of a raise he needs for you to be able to afford continuing to work for  them. Maybe his parents can afford to give a raise, but not enough to actually meet your expenses. Or maybe you'll find that they could pay him even better than his other job.\n\nLast thing, if the numbers show that him going back to the other job is the best thing for your family... What it means for his parents business is not your responsibility.\n\nIf their business can't succeed without him, but they can't afford to pay him enough for you to live on, then the business needs to fail.\n\nAnd if they can afford it, but refuse to do so, well the words I'd want to use to describe them would be very not nice.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you and your husband started and run the business.  What are your in-laws involvement with it?", "Exactly. They are using him, and OP since she does the books for free. They don't care about the consequences it's having on his family. But husband needs to either stand up for himself and ask, no DEMAND, a raise, or go back to his old job since it's been stated they'd happily have him back. Let his parents try to hire someone to do their son's work. \n\nOP, NTA. But husband needs to step up and do what he needs to keep his family secure and safe.", "Just my FIL is mainly involved. Its an upholstery business and he is the main upholsterer. Without FIL there would be no business. My husband is learning too and FIL hopes one day he will leave the business to him. Thats all my FIL does though, just the upholstery projects. Nothing else. My husband handles all clients, phone calls, pick ups, drop offs, accounting , technical, legal, etc\u2026.They also pulled out my brother in law from work, since he is young, they dont make him pay rent and pay him $200 a week which to me is complete BS\u2026 he could be working making way more and actually going to college but I cant get involved with that because I have to deal with my husband\u2019s situation.", "Yea, this is ridiculous, especially considering you're going into debt over this.  You do need to have your husband on board with you on this though, hopefully something as simple as sitting him down and going over your long term financials will open his eyes.", "NTA.

I think he needs to look for another job and then if he finds one, tell his parents that he is leaving their employ unless they give him a raise to match the potential job and stick to the 40 hour work week.

If there\u2019s this much pushback with getting paid equal to the job he left, will his parents keep giving him raises like he would presumably be receiving at his old job? If they want to keep him on, they should be beating the $32/hour.", "This is so sad. This something I fear, if the business goes belly up and he hs invested all these years in it, then what? He has no retirement plan, no saved money.", "Yes - and a track record of a failed business on his resume when trying to find a new job.
