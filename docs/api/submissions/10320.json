It is completely bizarre and totally rude that people are angry that you didn't share your IPA.

Much like, at parties here, it\u2019s not weird for the host to drink whatever they want from their stash, because their stash is there because it\u2019s their home.

Yea, but there's plenty of cheapish IPA you can share. \n\nAlso. You know what me sharing my whiskey lead to? My regular drinking friends would gift me bottles. I'd host a party, they'd show up with a bottle and say \"hey, I saw this and it looked good, let's try it! And what wasn't drank was gifted to my collection.

Take note of the flavors your getting up front, notice how it feels on your tongue, then once you swallow do you notice any different flavors lingering? Then you can repeat as you wish- I generally give a beer I\u2019m drinking and unfamiliar with a once over like this then don\u2019t go in too much more. \n\nAnd it\u2019s totally okay to be put off of beer- a lot of people first intro to beers is American macro lager which is a very narrow window.
