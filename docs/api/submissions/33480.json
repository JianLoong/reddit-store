That is only going to further drive them away from being healthier and you should be instilling these habits into them anyway. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for being upset, but you need to give appropriate consequences (e.g. no more watching tv until all chores are done etc.) and follow through.", "They\u2019re lazy, and you\u2019re just trying to teach them a good lesson, but if they said they were joking and offered to help, I would\u2019ve let them help and just keep it as a warning for the future.

Change your shoping list, cooking and if they want anything else (chocholate, sweets and so on), they can buy it by themself).

It can create the wrong associations with food and fitness.  \n\nBut at the same time, I don't agree with your daughter's claim of being \"too fat\" to put the laundry on and vacuum. She is insulting herself, and if she states it in public could be insulting/body shaming bystanders. \n\nAfter all, obesity can be a complex issue. There are a number of factors to obesity : \n\n* calories\n* diet\n* physical activity \n* genetics\n* medical reasons\n\nIn many cases, obesity is more to do with environmental factors, such as not having easy access to healthy food, or unhealthy eating habits learned during childhood.\n\nIt is also worth noting, just as some medical conditions can contribute to weight gain, medical conditions can work against people trying to lose weight.  \n\nAnd people can be considered overweight whilst being relatively fit, or 'average' weight for their age/height whilst being unfit. \n\nNow, I've addressed your youngest trying to use \"too fat\" as an excuse not do something, lets return to your comments.\n\nWell, from what you've said both your daughters were rude, and it was your youngest who try to use her and her sister's weight as reasoning not to act.  You shouted and threatened them with diet and exercise, yes, but then you challenged them to consider how spoilt they were. Their response was to offer to do the chores \"soon\" - in other words, not yet; at this point, they could've got off the couch and started to do something, rather than some vague timeframe to act. You called them lazy, but you also said it made you realise you'd failed as a parent. \n\nI'm going NTA, but please consider:\n\n1. Are your daughters normally idle and inactive over all things, or will they do activities when it comes to their own personal interests? \n2. Do they have access to healthy food?  Not simply do they have access to sweets, but do they have access to a choice of healthy food at home and at school?\n3. Are there any known health/medical issues?\n4. Do you have a action/reward process for things like chores? Are they incentivised in any way to help out - I don't just mean cash, but acknowledgement/thanks, or being allowed certain activities in return for their hard work. \n5. When they say they will do something, do they fail to follow through at all, or do they not follow through promptly? Do they work better when there is a fixed timeframe to do something?\n6. Do you do family activities? Get out into the local parks or countryside together? \n7. If you ensured healthy food was available and they still struggled with weight loss, would you take them to the doctors to see if there is something else at play, or would you just blame them for not trying hard enough?\n8. And as they say walk, don't run. If you want to ***encourage*** them to improve their fitness and diet, try to do it in a healthy way which won't leave them with issues down the line.", "YTA for how you handled this. Shouting at your children and attacking their weight was not the correct move in this situation, especially considering you admit to being the cause.

Holy shit, check yourself)", "YTA\n\n  \nSo you are faced with the consequences of your shitty parenting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore shitty parenting will not solve that.", "NTA.

No chores, the get nothing.", "NTA, they were supposed to do the chores, they did not, they deserve some kind of punishment. Getting them healthy is not punishment, that is good parenting.

The solution with that is to give deadlines.\n\n2nd, if they have weight issue, it\u2019s not necessary the right age to tackle them, at least not by yourself. You are obviously responsible for not feeding them healthy food, but at their age, hormones have a big impact on the metabolism. Loosing weight can be very easy or very difficult, and too much pressure can lead to eating disorders.\n\nI always wonder how people who have clearly \u2018fat\u2019 8-10 yo don\u2019t do anything. Weight can be caused by medical issues and if that\u2019s the case, you cannot always avoid them putting on more weight but you can monitor the underlying conditions. I have a very good friend who is morbidly obese (everyone in his family is)\nBut now that he is reaching 40, and his 8yo is worrying, he is starting to deal with some of the causes and consequences (like sleep apneas) as he wants to be on this earth as long as possible for his child and hopefully grand children. He will probably always be obese but he is trying to be as healthy as possible.", "Shouting was unnecessary. Apart from that, I don't think you are in the wrong. 15 and 17yo girls are definitely old enough to help doing the housework, and what you asked wasn't tremendous. It's their bad for being that lazy.\n\nAbout the subject of their weight, they brought it as a sarcastic joke, this is giving the stick to be beaten with. You used that joke to make a valid point about their health condition, especially when related to their excessive laziness in this particular situation.\nHowever, weight or more generally physical appearance can be touchy subjects that can easily destroy someone's self-esteem, especially when negativity is brought by a parent or a very close one (partner, close family, best friends...). So, as I said earlier, shouting was unnecessary (at least on this part of the discussion). This is the kind of subject that must be talk with your daughter, especially for their health condition in the future, but maybe not during a burst of anger.\n\nSo, you might be the AH depending on what you said exactly and how you said it. (Especially this last part in your post \"I told them how eye-opening the experience had been in terms of my failures as a dad.\". Idk how you phrased that IRL, but telling your children that they represent your failure as a dad can be damaging.). It's impossible for us to know exactly how your argument went and the exact words that were used (and in what tone), but if you haven't crossed the line there, then I think you are NTA and that blaming their laziness and using their own sarcastic joke to awaken them about their weight/health condition (getting out of hand?) is included in your role as a dad.\n\nMaybe try to talk with them later, once the tension is gone, and explain to your girls that you were trying to make them aware of their responsibility as future adults (household chores and other annoying adults stuff they will eventually have to confront in their life). Maybe apologize for being too direct about the \"too fat\" part of the argument, but address them your concerns about their health because being \"too fat\", as she said, might not be critical at 15 or 17 (PE sucks, it's harder to find a boyfriend... But you probably won't die soon), but when you hit 50 and older, it's a whole different story featuring a lot of health problems.", "i suck at following through", "They're starting to act like this more and more often.

He's a grown man, he's a parent. He should know better than to shout at his children for not doing their housework right away and commenting on their weight in such a way.

This could mean he only ever bought fast food/junk/etc. Do you think two children are to blame for that? \n\nHe's not trying to get them to be responsible for their actions, he's calling his daughters fat in a moment of anger.

It\u2019s almost too late already to salvage your kids from being both unhealthy and brats, the reversal needs to start NOW. \n\nIf you struggle being a parent, perhaps you might look for a therapist to help you work through how to be a parent instead of trying to be their friend who goes along with anything trying to be liked.
