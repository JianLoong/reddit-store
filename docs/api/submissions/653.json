I have a guy best friend, Andy(32M), for over a decade. I met Andy online when I was 16 & he had been with me throughout some traumatic experiences of my life. And soon, I had fallen in love with him completely, but we were just best friends on the outside. Everything was going on smoothly until I went to meet Andy & Sush(I met her at 18& in college)tagged along. They're instantly drawn to each other & soon began dating. \n\nAt 22, I moved out of state for higher studies where I met Kevin. The first impression wasn't great but we got grouped for a project & became good buddies over two years. Things between us changed and we began dating & soon became official. I was mostly LC with Andy and Sush & only visited them during holidays with Kevin. So coming to the present, the three of us are in the same city due to our jobs while Sush is gonna be SAHM(she's 3 months pregnant). Andy proposed to her last year & they're getting married next week. The thing is, I used to write during the hard times of my life which escalated, but with positivity after I met Andy. He was kinda my muse, but I stopped writing, both due to university stress & lack of any ideas. But I had written a beautiful poem congratulating him on his love-life & wishing him all the best for the future which I've decided to read at the wedding speech. \n\nThe issue; Kevin, when he got to know about the poem, started being mean and condescending, talking about how I never wrote anything for him, how I always prioritised Andy over him(Andy and I hardly talk now if not about his marriage). Yeah, he knows about Andy being my first love & all, and he was fine with that, with a bit of negative reaction considering I was still friends with my first love.\nAll of us have come on a beautiful vacation, &  Kevin & I are planning to throw a small party here to congratulate the couple. This morning Kevin brought up the topic once again & started berating Andy & me & throwing accusations like how I still might be in love with Andy and how he felt like being an affair partner when I should be the one feeling like a side-chick which hit a sensitive spot. He demanded me to cut off all contacts with Andy & we started arguing back & forth.\n\nAt some point, things got heated as he brought up my insecurities, & I told him to f*ck off and go to his Mom if he had so many problems. Well, bad choice as Kevin didn't have a good relationship with his mother & went NC after he turned 18. He went quiet all of a sudden & stormed out of the room. I realised my mistake but it was too late. Now he's not answering any of my calls or replying to any of my texts & while I'm apologetic for my outburst and can understand where he stands, he also shouldn't have brought up my insecurities, so am I TA?\n\nUpdate: Thank you people for your opinions. While I acknowledge I'm the AH, I've apologized to Kevin. He's still  mad and we've decided to go on a break to reconsider our relationship. Also, I have decided to go NC with Andy and fix myself and my issues.", "created_utc": 1667110876, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh6ezr/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_to_f_off_and_hitting_a/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am wondering if I am the only AH here for hitting a sensitive spot in return when my fianc\u00e9 did the same to me. \n\n2. I might be TA for hurting my fianc\u00e9 by bringing up his deranged mother. I kinda understand his insecurities and he was wrong to bring up my past insecurities, but it's also knowable that I might have been upset if he was friends with his ex or sumn too. But I don't love Andy anymore and he's just a best friend to me and nothing more. And moreover, I went LC with him even before Kevin told me to.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s clear from this post that you are still in love with Andy and that your fianc\u00e9e is just someone who will \u201cdo.\u201d  Until you find someone else who makes you feel like Andy does, you should probably reconsider your relationship with Kevin. You did a lot of damage that will always be on the surface with Kevin anyway. If you guys still insist on getting married, I would make sure to get some premarital counseling first.", "YTA- your insecurity is the fact that Andy never liked you romantically?? So your fianc\u00e9( probably ex now) is absolutely right lol.", "YTA you called this other guy your muse, your first love, you wrote a poem for him before and now want to read it at his wedding, your fiance expresses concern because of the past feelings with this guy, the fact you still had the poem 9years later, then you attack his biggest insecurity and go at him about a NC thing with his mom.", "yta, and i think there\u2019s a good chance you can refer to kevin as your ex-fiance now", "YtA\n... you do realize youre making the man you say you love and want to mary feel like some sort of sad consolation prize you relunctently took when you couldnt win the one you actually wanted? Him bringing up your sensitive issue was actually relevant to him, while yours was just a low blow attack. Maybe you should consider not being in a relationship right now... theres a saying about how when you love 2 people the 2nd person loses bevause there wouldnt be another if you truly loved them... but its late and I'm too tired to look it up. Just set the poor guy free and let him find someone not pining after someone they cant have.", "YTA. If I was your fianc\u00e8 and I read this I would also think you still have feelings for him. Your fianc\u00e8 is not being insecure - you're keeping poems you wrote for him, he's your first love, and you haven't put your fianc\u00e8 on the same pedestal as him, and then when he brings it up, you throw his strained relationship with his mother at him. \n\nYou have some serious grovelling to do and I would suggest going NC with Andy to show you're serious.", "INFO: Were you actually invited to the wedding, or is this going to be a \"speak now or forever hold your peace\" kind of poem?", "YTA. And if you read that cringe poem at this friend's wedding it'd be the second count of YTA. In the first degree. Oof.", "YTA, i hope your (hopefully ex fiance) can find someone who loves him with all their heart, and not someone who still loves their first crush. Show him this post please, he should open his eyes to thw disrespect you keep showing him", "YTA It sounds like you feel deeply about Andy and do still love him. The upcoming weddings and being together again have brought up a lot of complicated emotions that your future husband is not blind to. \n\nYou also seem to have the idea that you would have been with Andy if not for Sush.\n>Everything was going on smoothly until I went to meet Andy & Sush(I met her at 18& in college)tagged along\n\nI imagine you've been talking about how great Andy is, and you wrote a poem for him, which would make Kevin feel really insecure. He shouldn't have brought up your insecurities, but instead of talking it out you doubled down, cursed at him, and brought up his strained relationship with his mother. If you want this relationship to work, you both need to go to couples counseling and figure out how to communicate with each other.", "YTA.", "YTA and so is your fianc\u00e9. You both went too far, but you did also gush about Andy in your story here so your fianc\u00e9 being insecure is understandable.  You need to apologize and deserve one as well.  Communicate and your fianc\u00e9 needs reassurance.  Use this time to cool down and think through what all you need to say.  He should not have accused you either so hopefully he is doing the same.", "Yes. YTA. And so is he. ESH Y'all need to really sit down and talk things out when you've both calmed down since y'all both obviously have some sore spots.", "ESH. \n\nHe could have handled it better but you don't seem to care about him. You keep acting like Andy is your \"everything\" and u wrote a whole poem for him while you have never done something like that for your future husband \n\nIn an ideal world, he shouldn't be bothered. But unfortunately the world is not ideal and we are all just humans with insecurities and all. So, Y TA because instead of reassuring him and making him comfortable you didn't care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
