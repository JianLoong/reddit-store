I\u2019ve met some of his family and there\u2019s never been any issues. Obviously I\u2019m not completely comfortable around them yet but it\u2019s all friendly as of now. \n\nThey invited me to their lakehouse to stay with them for a week in July. I was talking with my boyfriend over FaceTime about what I should pack and we got onto the topic of swimsuits. \n\nI\u2019ve always been the type to wear \u201cskimpy\u201d swimsuit bottoms because I like the way they look and I want the least amount of tan lines. He then told me that I\u2019d have to buy more \u201cconservative\u201d swimsuit bottoms to wear around his family. To be clear, my boyfriend also doesn\u2019t like skimpy swimsuits but if we go to the beach together it\u2019s fine, because he\u2019s with me. He just doesn\u2019t want negative attention from other men when I\u2019m alone. \n\nDon\u2019t get my wrong, I obviously respect his family and I wasn\u2019t going to wear a thong swimsuit bottom but the one I showed him was just *barely* showing booty cheeks. The one he wants me to wear are basically shorts. \n\nI told him that I wasn\u2019t gonna wear the shorts because they were ugly and the swimsuit I was going to bring was fine. I brought up the fact that his cousins (F19 and F17) are also going to the lakehouse and they showed me the bottoms they were going to bring (it was the same amount of skimpy as mine)\n\nAll he said was \u201cI don\u2019t care what they\u2019re wearing, you\u2019re my girlfriend and I don\u2019t want my family, especially people like my mother and aunts to talk shit about you after you leave. Just please wear the shorts or swimsuit bottoms that completely cover your bum.\u201d \n\nI then said that I woulf think about it but honestly I don\u2019t want to constantly feel like I have to \u201cappease his family\u201d. \n\nAITA for just wearing what I want at the lakehouse?", "created_utc": 1686185782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143unvw/aita_for_not_wanting_to_appease_my_boyfriends/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It will be a lifetime of this whenever you go out without him or whenever you are with his family. People who want to trash talk you don't actually care what you wear anyway, they will find a reason if they are determined to look for it.", "NTA\n\nIf his cousins' suits are ok, then yours is ok. I'd be less concerned with his family and more concerned with HIM. He's an AH. The swimsuits can't be a major family issue if the teen cousins plan to wear them.\n\nRed flags -- big red flags. BF is way too controlling.", "At first I would say I think it\u2019s respectful to wear something that covers if the family is conservative, and because it\u2019s their house. But if the cousins are wearing similar bathing suits, and he just fears his family gossiping about you, oh well. Wear what you want.", "Info: is not going an option?", "NTA. This is a tricky issue and man, it sure is easier to play along sometimes. Like, I understand the request and it can feel \\*amazing\\* to detour right around a crisis. \n\nThat being said, you made \\*exactly\\* the right reference: you checked the swimsuits of the other girls that will be joining you, and yours is in line with theirs. If your boyfriend is still objecting, that's a red flag. \n\nSo I can completely understand sticking to your guns on swimsuit coverage because it's not his family's behavior that's sus here, it's \\*his\\*.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to alter your appearance to appease his family, but I think it\u2019s fair to reasonably respect them in their own home.\n\nSo as long as what you want to wear would be considered \u201cnormal\u201d and not overly \u201crevealing\u201d - NTA", "NTA. It sounds like it's less about what his family wants and more about what *he* wants. Tell him he can wear the swimsuit he picked out, but you're going to choose your own.", "Oh this isn't about his family at all, it's about his control of you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He doesn't get to control what you wear. As long as it's a normal bathing suit and your vagina isn't hanging out, then go for it", "NTA, you checked with his cousins to make sure you weren\u2019t bringing an overly revealing swimsuit. Your swimsuit is the same as theirs. Most swimsuits show a tiny bit of cheek. It isn\u2019t like you are bringing a thong or g-string, sounds like it\u2019s just a normal bathing suit. Your comment about him not liking you receiving  negative attention from men when he is not around makes me feel like this is more of a him thing and has very little to do with his mother or aunts. I would think hard about whether I felt comfortable being with someone who wants to police what I wear. It seems controlling and behavior like that typically gets worse the longer you are in a relationship.", "NTA - He doesn\u2019t get to dictate what you wear. The most you could compromise on I guess is wearing a wrap when you aren\u2019t in the water? But that\u2019s totally up to you and shouldn\u2019t be something you *have* to do.\n\nHonestly I\u2019d ask his mom yourself since you\u2019re friendly with her. \u201cYour son thinks you\u2019ll be uncomfortable if I wear these bottoms to the lake house. Is that true?\u201d And deal from there. I just wonder if he\u2019s using his family as an excuse to control what you wear, since it seems like that\u2019s a bit of an issue for him.", "NTA but really should op be with a family that can\u2019t handle her in a bikini? and a bf that seems a tad controlling? What is wrong with his family that a bikini is a problem? Be with a family that makes you feel accepted and comfortable", "NTA. It sounds like he wants to you appease HIM, not his family. \n\nHim controlling what you wear is concerning.", "NTA maybe he can cover you with that giant red flag he\u2019s waving?", "NTA. Stop right here. He is policing your outfit choices. You give in once, he will police other things, who you can hang out with for example.", "You've skated right on by \"He just doesn\u2019t want negative attention from other men when I\u2019m alone\" and hooooo boy that right there is a big red flag. You really ought to sit with that and think about it for a bit. Maybe there's some other things he does that are controlling like that. Or maybe he's just not \\*doing them yet\\*. It's never only one thing, and the number of things never gets smaller, only larger.", "NTA. It\u2019s not is mom and aunties, it\u2019s him. I would NOPE tf out of this relationship or draw some hard line boundaries now. No tiptoeing.  This is what I like wearing and this is what I will be wearing. I especially like the part about him not liking the \u2018negative attention from guys when he\u2019s not around\u2019. This is a controlling man.", "Nta cause its your body and your clothes. Could always do a little wrap to cover but i mean its water everyones going to be wet and no one paying attention", "NTA although I get why he\u2019s asking you if you\u2019ve only been dating 6 months. Sounds like his mom & aunts are like gossip queens but he doesn\u2019t get to control what you do or do not wear. He asked, you said no, he should drop it. But don\u2019t be surprised when the females in his family talk shit. Sounds like the exact type of people they are.", "Welcome to Red Flag City,please take one pair of rose colored glasses and put them on while we commence the tour. \n\n This is something that will only get worse if you don\u2019t put the brakes on this now. His reasons for trying to control what you wear are beyond weak. If his mom and aunts are shit talkers,there\u2019s ALWAYS something to talk shit about. Even if there wasn\u2019t,the choice to appease them is YOURS and he should support whatever you decide. \n\n Just do your thing at the lake house,and if your BF gets too pissy about it,maybe you should just cancel those big 7-month anniversary plans.", "NTA, wear what you're comfortable in. Set these boundaries now. He shouldn't worry about you appeasing them, but rather him appeasing you.", "You don't know them well, so it's probably best not to show them your ass yet", "NTA", "Your boyfriend seems Hella controlling and my suggestion would be to run.", "NTA If there is a time to be your authentic self has arrived, it\u2019s right now. You absolutely should wear your skimpy bikini and let the conservatives know that you will not be caving to their standards or whatever they want to call it. Your boyfriend is the issue here.", "NTA he sounds controlling as hell. You should be able to wear whatever you want", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't go, and drop the AH controlling bf.", "100% normal I don\u2019t want my family to judge my girlfriend and future wife negatively. She wears crop tops all the time and I love it. \n\nI would not want anyone in my family having negative impressions of her for something that\u2019s easily avoidable.", "YTA. It is not a big deal.", "YTA.\n\nCould you compromise by finding some bottoms that don't show butt cheek? Shorts seems extreme, but I would say they're sporty, not ugly. \n\nI get that you should be able to wear what you want, but this is family time, you don't need to be sexy in front of his folks, it's not your house, and your BF knows best, so follow his lead. \n\nYou're a guest at their lake house, your BF knows how his relatives are, and how they talk about people. Really, wearing the shorts are for him, not his family, because he doesn't want to have to defend you and hear negative things about you and get upset. \n\nSo cover that ass for a week. Is that so difficult?", "YTA. Is this really the hill you want to die on? To be clear, nobody *should* be gossiping about you. But it happens. I know because my family would do the exact same thing. \n\nLook, you will survive wearing a more modest swimsuit. It will only pay off in the long run.", "YTA if there\u2019s an actual reason. There\u2019s a very strong possibility that a female in his family has a husband or partner with a wandering eye, and she doesn\u2019t want a lovely young woman there in a skimpy suit getting his attention. It\u2019s possible that the others can wear that kind of bathing suit because they\u2019re family. Had a similar situation happen to me years ago. My then boyfriend\u2019s dad was a kind of a creep and his mom was incredibly insecure and didn\u2019t want me coming over \u201chalf naked\u201d because it made her uncomfortable. She was such a nice lady, I had no problem dressing more modest whenever the dad would be around. However, NTA if your bf is a control freak.", "NTA - It's never a good sign when someone wants to control what you wear. You are dressing the same as his relatives. You've only been dating him 6 months, and he is beginning to show you who he is.", "NTA, but honestly you would be doing this for your boyfriend more than for his family. This could be a red flag but if my bf wanted to wear a speedo I'd be requesting he please not so I can see this as an reasonable ask.", "Nta. And you're not appeasing his family. You are appeasing him.", "NTA, your boyfriend is being the AH.  Wear whatever the hell makes you happy, its entirely your body and your decision.  I'd dump a guy who tried to control what I wore EVER, especially if it was so \"other guys don't look.\". Insecurity in a man is extremely unattractive.", "Nta, but your BF is both for catering to his shitty family and for being controlling jealous and weird", "NTA. His flag is dripping marinara off it it is so red.", "It\u2019s not his family you\u2019d be appeasing, it\u2019s him!", "NTA if he doesn\u2019t like skimpy swimsuit bottoms then he doesn\u2019t have to wear them. \n\nIt\u2019s only been 6 months and he is this controlling. I would rethink the relationship to be honest, it\u2019ll only get worse.", "That\u2019s what got me, if the cousins wear similar things then what makes him think that his mom and aunts are going to talk shit? Not okay for him to be this controlling, NTA.", "Screw that, especially if they are conservative. She can do whatever she wants.", "Clearly it is NOT considered normal, as she already said she want \" least amount of tan lines\". A normal and not overly revealing one cannot give you that, period.", "What's normal?", "Interesting suggestion. Maybe she should ask the cousins (19 and 17)? Since she's already discussed swimsuits with them, it might be easier/more discreet to get their perspective.", "Yup - he sounds a TAD controlling.", "I think they\u2019ve already seen him though. \n\nHe\u2019s their son.", "Agree \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "If someone had a spouse with a wandering eye, that is still not on OP. Hand the asshole a set of blinkers or a blindfold in public rather than choosing to police what other women wear punishing them for his bad behaviour. \n\nThis honestly sounds like OP\u2019s bf doesn\u2019t like it and is making excuses so he can start controlling what she wears. If he and his family are the type of people to assume morals based on the clothes being worn, are they really people she wants to associate with?", "Then he needs to stop being a creep. This is not ok.", "I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s the case here too.His mom and his aunts are divorced so there won\u2019t be any older men there, his cousins will be bringing their boyfriends. They\u2019re guys around our age (18-20) so I guess my bf doesn\u2019t want them having wandering eyes towards me?", "I think it\u2019s rude to make ppl uncomfortable in their own home \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I would never dress immodestly at the house of people who value modesty", "You\u2019re reading far too deep into this. Full cover bikini briefs result in horrid tan lines. She already said it\u2019s not a g-string, and the other girls are wearing similar. It\u2019s probably just bikini cut or Brazilian.
