I\u2019ve met some of his family and there\u2019s never been any issues. Obviously I\u2019m not completely comfortable around them yet but it\u2019s all friendly as of now. \n\nThey invited me to their lakehouse to stay with them for a week in July. I was talking with my boyfriend over FaceTime about what I should pack and we got onto the topic of swimsuits. \n\nI\u2019ve always been the type to wear \u201cskimpy\u201d swimsuit bottoms because I like the way they look and I want the least amount of tan lines. He then told me that I\u2019d have to buy more \u201cconservative\u201d swimsuit bottoms to wear around his family. To be clear, my boyfriend also doesn\u2019t like skimpy swimsuits but if we go to the beach together it\u2019s fine, because he\u2019s with me. He just doesn\u2019t want negative attention from other men when I\u2019m alone. \n\nDon\u2019t get my wrong, I obviously respect his family and I wasn\u2019t going to wear a thong swimsuit bottom but the one I showed him was just *barely* showing booty cheeks. The one he wants me to wear are basically shorts. \n\nI told him that I wasn\u2019t gonna wear the shorts because they were ugly and the swimsuit I was going to bring was fine. I brought up the fact that his cousins (F19 and F17) are also going to the lakehouse and they showed me the bottoms they were going to bring (it was the same amount of skimpy as mine)\n\nAll he said was \u201cI don\u2019t care what they\u2019re wearing, you\u2019re my girlfriend and I don\u2019t want my family, especially people like my mother and aunts to talk shit about you after you leave. Just please wear the shorts or swimsuit bottoms that completely cover your bum.\u201d \n\nI then said that I woulf think about it but honestly I don\u2019t want to constantly feel like I have to \u201cappease his family\u201d. \n\nAITA for just wearing what I want at the lakehouse?\n\nEdit: oookayyy so this post turned into a  \u201cyour bf is controlling you need to run away\u201d comment section. I just want to make things clear , and maybe I should\u2019ve worded it differently, but my boyfriend doesn\u2019t care what I wear, he would just *PREFER* I not wear skimpy swimsuits when he\u2019s not there because he knows how men are, especially in the city we live in (high percentage of crimes against women like rape and sexualization of young girls etc). ALSO some comments are assuming that my bf is just using his family as a \u201ccover\u201d for his own preferences, HOWEVER I am aware that his family leans conservative so it\u2019s not out of the ordinary that they would have some opinions on my \u201cskimpy\u201d swimsuit even if I thought it wasn\u2019t skimpy.", "created_utc": 1686185782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143unvw/aita_for_not_wanting_to_appease_my_boyfriends/", "score": 536, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It will be a lifetime of this whenever you go out without him or whenever you are with his family. People who want to trash talk you don't actually care what you wear anyway, they will find a reason if they are determined to look for it.", "NTA\n\nIf his cousins' suits are ok, then yours is ok. I'd be less concerned with his family and more concerned with HIM. He's an AH. The swimsuits can't be a major family issue if the teen cousins plan to wear them.\n\nRed flags -- big red flags. BF is way too controlling.", "At first I would say I think it\u2019s respectful to wear something that covers if the family is conservative, and because it\u2019s their house. But if the cousins are wearing similar bathing suits, and he just fears his family gossiping about you, oh well. Wear what you want.", "Info: is not going an option?", "NTA. This is a tricky issue and man, it sure is easier to play along sometimes. Like, I understand the request and it can feel \\*amazing\\* to detour right around a crisis. \n\nThat being said, you made \\*exactly\\* the right reference: you checked the swimsuits of the other girls that will be joining you, and yours is in line with theirs. If your boyfriend is still objecting, that's a red flag. \n\nSo I can completely understand sticking to your guns on swimsuit coverage because it's not his family's behavior that's sus here, it's \\*his\\*.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to alter your appearance to appease his family, but I think it\u2019s fair to reasonably respect them in their own home.\n\nSo as long as what you want to wear would be considered \u201cnormal\u201d and not overly \u201crevealing\u201d - NTA", "NTA.

He doesn't get to control what you wear. As long as it's a normal bathing suit and your vagina isn't hanging out, then go for it", "NTA, you checked with his cousins to make sure you weren\u2019t bringing an overly revealing swimsuit. Your swimsuit is the same as theirs. Most swimsuits show a tiny bit of cheek. It isn\u2019t like you are bringing a thong or g-string, sounds like it\u2019s just a normal bathing suit. Your comment about him not liking you receiving  negative attention from men when he is not around makes me feel like this is more of a him thing and has very little to do with his mother or aunts. I would think hard about whether I felt comfortable being with someone who wants to police what I wear. It seems controlling and behavior like that typically gets worse the longer you are in a relationship.", "NTA - He doesn\u2019t get to dictate what you wear. The most you could compromise on I guess is wearing a wrap when you aren\u2019t in the water? But that\u2019s totally up to you and shouldn\u2019t be something you *have* to do.\n\nHonestly I\u2019d ask his mom yourself since you\u2019re friendly with her. \u201cYour son thinks you\u2019ll be uncomfortable if I wear these bottoms to the lake house. Is that true?\u201d And deal from there. I just wonder if he\u2019s using his family as an excuse to control what you wear, since it seems like that\u2019s a bit of an issue for him.", "NTA but really should op be with a family that can\u2019t handle her in a bikini? and a bf that seems a tad controlling? What is wrong with his family that a bikini is a problem? Be with a family that makes you feel accepted and comfortable", "NTA. It sounds like he wants to you appease HIM, not his family. \n\nHim controlling what you wear is concerning.", "NTA maybe he can cover you with that giant red flag he\u2019s waving?", "NTA. Stop right here. He is policing your outfit choices. You give in once, he will police other things, who you can hang out with for example.", "You've skated right on by \"He just doesn\u2019t want negative attention from other men when I\u2019m alone\" and hooooo boy that right there is a big red flag. You really ought to sit with that and think about it for a bit. Maybe there's some other things he does that are controlling like that. Or maybe he's just not \\*doing them yet\\*. It's never only one thing, and the number of things never gets smaller, only larger.", "NTA. It\u2019s not is mom and aunties, it\u2019s him. I would NOPE tf out of this relationship or draw some hard line boundaries now. No tiptoeing.  This is what I like wearing and this is what I will be wearing. I especially like the part about him not liking the \u2018negative attention from guys when he\u2019s not around\u2019. This is a controlling man.", "Nta cause its your body and your clothes. Could always do a little wrap to cover but i mean its water everyones going to be wet and no one paying attention", "NTA although I get why he\u2019s asking you if you\u2019ve only been dating 6 months. Sounds like his mom & aunts are like gossip queens but he doesn\u2019t get to control what you do or do not wear. He asked, you said no, he should drop it. But don\u2019t be surprised when the females in his family talk shit. Sounds like the exact type of people they are.", "Welcome to Red Flag City,please take one pair of rose colored glasses and put them on while we commence the tour. \n\n This is something that will only get worse if you don\u2019t put the brakes on this now. His reasons for trying to control what you wear are beyond weak. If his mom and aunts are shit talkers,there\u2019s ALWAYS something to talk shit about. Even if there wasn\u2019t,the choice to appease them is YOURS and he should support whatever you decide. \n\n Just do your thing at the lake house,and if your BF gets too pissy about it,maybe you should just cancel those big 7-month anniversary plans.", "NTA, wear what you're comfortable in. Set these boundaries now. He shouldn't worry about you appeasing them, but rather him appeasing you.", "You don't know them well, so it's probably best not to show them your ass yet", "NTA", "Your boyfriend seems Hella controlling and my suggestion would be to run.", "NTA If there is a time to be your authentic self has arrived, it\u2019s right now. You absolutely should wear your skimpy bikini and let the conservatives know that you will not be caving to their standards or whatever they want to call it. Your boyfriend is the issue here.", "NTA he sounds controlling as hell. You should be able to wear whatever you want", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't go, and drop the AH controlling bf.", "100% normal I don\u2019t want my family to judge my girlfriend and future wife negatively. She wears crop tops all the time and I love it. \n\nI would not want anyone in my family having negative impressions of her for something that\u2019s easily avoidable.", "YTA. It is not a big deal.", "YTA.\n\nCould you compromise by finding some bottoms that don't show butt cheek? Shorts seems extreme, but I would say they're sporty, not ugly. \n\nI get that you should be able to wear what you want, but this is family time, you don't need to be sexy in front of his folks, it's not your house, and your BF knows best, so follow his lead. \n\nYou're a guest at their lake house, your BF knows how his relatives are, and how they talk about people. Really, wearing the shorts are for him, not his family, because he doesn't want to have to defend you and hear negative things about you and get upset. \n\nSo cover that ass for a week. Is that so difficult?", "YTA. Is this really the hill you want to die on? To be clear, nobody *should* be gossiping about you. But it happens. I know because my family would do the exact same thing. \n\nLook, you will survive wearing a more modest swimsuit. It will only pay off in the long run.", "YTA if there\u2019s an actual reason. There\u2019s a very strong possibility that a female in his family has a husband or partner with a wandering eye, and she doesn\u2019t want a lovely young woman there in a skimpy suit getting his attention. It\u2019s possible that the others can wear that kind of bathing suit because they\u2019re family. Had a similar situation happen to me years ago. My then boyfriend\u2019s dad was a kind of a creep and his mom was incredibly insecure and didn\u2019t want me coming over \u201chalf naked\u201d because it made her uncomfortable. She was such a nice lady, I had no problem dressing more modest whenever the dad would be around. However, NTA if your bf is a control freak.", "NTA - It's never a good sign when someone wants to control what you wear. You are dressing the same as his relatives. You've only been dating him 6 months, and he is beginning to show you who he is.", "NTA, but honestly you would be doing this for your boyfriend more than for his family. This could be a red flag but if my bf wanted to wear a speedo I'd be requesting he please not so I can see this as an reasonable ask.", "Nta. And you're not appeasing his family. You are appeasing him.", "NTA, your boyfriend is being the AH.  Wear whatever the hell makes you happy, its entirely your body and your decision.  I'd dump a guy who tried to control what I wore EVER, especially if it was so \"other guys don't look.\". Insecurity in a man is extremely unattractive.", "Nta, but your BF is both for catering to his shitty family and for being controlling jealous and weird", "NTA. His flag is dripping marinara off it it is so red.", "It\u2019s not his family you\u2019d be appeasing, it\u2019s him!", "NTA if he doesn\u2019t like skimpy swimsuit bottoms then he doesn\u2019t have to wear them. \n\nIt\u2019s only been 6 months and he is this controlling. I would rethink the relationship to be honest, it\u2019ll only get worse.", "That\u2019s what got me, if the cousins wear similar things then what makes him think that his mom and aunts are going to talk shit? Not okay for him to be this controlling, NTA.", "Screw that, especially if they are conservative. She can do whatever she wants.", "Clearly it is NOT considered normal, as she already said she want \" least amount of tan lines\". A normal and not overly revealing one cannot give you that, period.", "What's normal?", "Interesting suggestion. Maybe she should ask the cousins (19 and 17)? Since she's already discussed swimsuits with them, it might be easier/more discreet to get their perspective.", "Yup - he sounds a TAD controlling.", "I think they\u2019ve already seen him though. \n\nHe\u2019s their son.", "Agree \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "If someone had a spouse with a wandering eye, that is still not on OP. Hand the asshole a set of blinkers or a blindfold in public rather than choosing to police what other women wear punishing them for his bad behaviour. \n\nThis honestly sounds like OP\u2019s bf doesn\u2019t like it and is making excuses so he can start controlling what she wears. If he and his family are the type of people to assume morals based on the clothes being worn, are they really people she wants to associate with?", "Then he needs to stop being a creep. This is not ok.", "I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s the case here too.His mom and his aunts are divorced so there won\u2019t be any older men there, his cousins will be bringing their boyfriends.

Full cover bikini briefs result in horrid tan lines. She already said it\u2019s not a g-string, and the other girls are wearing similar. It\u2019s probably just bikini cut or Brazilian.

I'm female and probably older than your parents and I find those swimsuits where the butt is hanging out entirely to be kind of grotesque, personally, but I also accept that it's considered normal these days and I guess just regular bikinis were just as shocking when they first came out. If women are actually comfortable exposing their butts like that....sure. \n\nThen I read on, and I CHANGED MY MIND. I think your boyfriend is being overly controlling and it's a red flag. First, you said it's not a thong and his cousins are going with similar swimsuits. Second, not even I swim in shorts and hey, I'm over 50. Third, do you really want to invest yourself in a family that would \"talk shit about you\" after you leave?\n\nFourth, and most importantly, wtf is this crap about \"it's ok if I'm there but not if you're alone\"? It's like, he wants to be seen with this hot girl and treating you like a possession and telling you what you can and cannot do when he's not around. This sort of thing never ends well. I had a friend when I was a teenager whose boyfriend also told her what kind of swimsuit she could wear (some matronly granny suit). He ended up being awful in so many other ways. It starts off with insidious stuff like this and at 6 months you're thinking he is just really into you, and after that you feel like the relationship is a prison.", "ESH. Yes, he is a jerk and sounds insecure and controlling.  But the way you are responding seems like you are digging in just because you don't want to be told what to do, and not because you see any concerns with his controlling behavior in general. You aren't good for each other.", "NTA but his possessiveness and control are red flags. Run", "NTA you're an adult, you and ONLY YOU get to decide what you wear. He doesn't get to \"let you\" wear things. Massive red flag that he thinks he is entitled to choose what you can and cannot wear.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is controlling, your body is his body to use & watch and he will police what you can show around his family, friends and the rest of the planet. This is not out of love, this is not caring for you, I'm sure nobody from his family will have anything to say especially if his cousins are wearing the same thing.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't about his family. \n\nThis is about him policing what you wear. \n\n>To be clear, my boyfriend also doesn\u2019t like skimpy swimsuits but if we go to the beach together it\u2019s fine, because he\u2019s with me. He just doesn\u2019t want negative attention from other men when I\u2019m alone.\n\nThis is now the second context in which he has controlled what you wear to humour his discomfort. And while he has had a pretence for it in both cases they set a really nasty precedent. Like if you not wearing that stuff while alone is to avoid 'negative attention' [ie any from men, I presume] then that could easily become anytime you are alone in general, right? And if he can argue that others judging you [his family in this case] is grounds to control what you wear then he could easily argue the same for friends, people on the street, etc. \n\nAnd that's how it will work. Only 6 months in and he is already controlling you but in very particular ways that are clearly setting up for more. If you want a relationship that will be defined by you tiptoeing around his sensibilities and insecurities go ahead, but see it for what it really is.", "You're not a sentiment doll that caters to the whims and fancies of his and the family's idea of modesty, especially considering the fact that he's mentioned that he wants you wearing such clothes only under his watchful eye. Lol.\n\nNTA there's no point going to such a restrictive place. Avoid and take your own vacation alone to a beach elsewhere, maybe. And post it on Instagram.", "NTA and f*ck him for being a coward.", "NTA- he sounds controlling and his family sounds conservative. Not the types I\u2019d like to deal with if I were you.", "NTA.......but honestly why are you dating this guy? He sounds like a controlling asshole. What else does he not let you do? I'm curious.", "If BF os worried about what his mother and aunt are going to say, he should take that up with them.", "People who want to trash talk you don't actually care what you wear anyway, they will find a reason if they are determined to look for it.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think the family has a problem with skimpy clothing. I think the bf does. $20 says the mom would probably compliment the swimsuit.", "INFO. How much do you like your bf? If you want this to be a longterm relationship, then YTA if you don\u2019t listen when he tells you what is likely to result with his family if you wear what the cousins wear.

His family might be conservative, but if you aren\u2019t, then you don\u2019t have to dress how they would prefer that you dress.  I get that you should be respectful, but you also need to be who you are.\n\nThe fact that your bf is pushing this so much is interesting.  Why is he pushing you to wear shorts if his cousins wear similar swimsuits?  Does he have a pervert family member?  Does he have an ex that cheated on him with a family member?  \n\nThis has nothing to do with where you live or the sexualization of young girls or any of that stuff you mentioned.  You will be at the beach, with his family, not walking down the city streets with your ass hanging out.\n\nHis family can have their opinions about your clothing, but they need to keep them to themselves and they do not get to dictate what you wear. If your bf keeps insisting that your clothing choices are determined by his family you need to pay attention to those red flags.

If they were so conservative, then the cousins would be wearing one-piece suits or boy shorts with sports bra types of tops. The logic doesn't add up, If the family gets to wear what they want then you should to.", "Have to agree. Partners don't \"let us.\" The issue is not his parents but him. If it was his parents, then the cousins wouldn't be wearing the same type of bottoms. Does he try to control other aspects of your life? Partners can set boundaries, that's fair. But then we have the option to accept them or move on.", "I have in laws that fill their days with gossip and putting others down.

It seems like something both you and her enjoy. \n\nIf you are certain in your knowledge that your family will react poorly to seeing your gf in a crop-top - while knowing full well that there is NOTHING wrong with wearing a crop-top - then you should have correctly drawn the conclusion that the problem lies with your family, not your girlfriend, right?\n\n> for something that\u2019s easily avoidable.\n\n\"It's easy!

I was all set to tell the OP to just scrap the cheeky swimsuits for this visit to their home, until I saw the part about him wanting her to wear shorts-style swimsuits and the cousins bringing just normal swimsuits the same as hers. \n\nThe part that tipped me off the most to side with her though, was the part about the bf being ok with skimpy swimsuits only if he was with her.", "I agree with this statement, just not in this situation.

Bottom line, either ur bf accepts u the way u r and is willing to go to bat for u against what his family wants, which means he's a keeper. Or he isn't and it's time to let him go. This isn't a red flag,  abuse, control issue so juch as its an experience issue. I have had more relationships than u. Ur partner should 100% support u being u, within reason. If their family doesn't like it, that's too bad, u r not in a relationship with their family. Partners family and I don't always agree, nor does mine with my partner, but we all respect each other enuff to agree to disagree.", "NTA\n\nYour edit shows how you are making up excuses for your bf's behavior. \n\n\"He only wants to control what I wear when he is not around\" is not making him sound any better.

If he only \u201cpreferred\u201d for you to wear the conservative swimsuit, he would\u2019ve dropped it and not insisted on his preference after you clearly stated your choice about what YOU have decided to wear. He is not respecting your choice and using his mom and aunts talking shit about you as a justification is a very manipulative way to make it seem like he\u2019s doing it to \u201cprotect you\u201d or for your own good when his family shouldn\u2019t be commenting on that, especially if his younger cousins would be wearing a similar swimsuit.

You obviously can't expect the same treatment as blood family. \n\nSecondly, if this is your first time in a relationship where you have to meet the parents of your SO, understand you reflect on your bf. The choice of swimwear is a small concession to make over a stable relationship with your in laws should you pursue this relationship further.\n\nThird, you know your boyfriend is conservative. You don't seem to be. The two views unavoidably clash. You're going to have a find a way to navigate it without \"I'll do what I want fuck everyone else\" attitude. Compromise. If this was your house, by all means, miss, set the rules. But it's not. Remove your ego from the equation. You're not there to show off your body or look good for anyone.

You\u2019re free to wear what you want. But you know that their family is conservative, so if you do decide to wear skimpy bottoms, then you have to accept whatever reaction they give you. Maybe they won\u2019t mind, but if they start giving you looks, well, you were forewarned. \n\nI say this because I come from a conservative family.

You are NTA, but i think your boyfriends is also NTA.", "\"My boyfriend does not care what I wear, he would just prefer...\"\n\nYeah, stop talking. These types never outright say it, they always spin it towards something else but the end result is the same: he tells you what (not) to wear. Next stop: he would never tell you to stop seeing your friends, he would just prefer you would not see that one mouthy redhead and maybe the one who always wears those tanktops because she is all about attracting the wrong kind of attention.

This is CLASSIC misogynistic insecurity where he\u2019s not comfortable with other men/people seeing you. Like yes there is a shitload of sexualizing from men unfortunately. But you\u2019re allowed to exist. It\u2019s not our fault men sexualize our bodies so it\u2019s not our responsibility to *make sure they don\u2019t sexualize us*. Men who harass and are sexually violent with women are going to do it whether you\u2019re wearing a swimsuit or sweats. \n\nHe\u2019s not worried about that.

He will always put his family before you, mark my words.", " NTA on wearing what you want. Definitely talk directly to his mother.\n\nFrom an Aussie protect your skin and wear longer sun safe rash shirts and board shorts or capris. I wear bikinis underneath them. It only takes being burned 5 times in your whole life to increases your skin cancer risks. Based on what I wear in the sun my own teens may say something similar though they also have rash shirts to wear and we have discussed the whys.
