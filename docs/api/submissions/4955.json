Because she works earlier than I do, we have an arrangement where I wake her up and drive her to work in the morning. Per her request, I also make sure she wakes up for morning appointments, etc.\n\nI try to wake her up pretty slowly and gently, and rub her arms and talk to her to keep her awake until she gets up. If I don\u2019t, she\u2019ll fall right back asleep.\n\nThing is, she\u2019s often grumpy and pissed in the mornings. I try to take it in stride because she\u2019s not a morning person. But sometimes the stuff she says while waking up can get hurtful and mean. We always discuss it and she always apologizes later and clearly feels bad, but still.\n\nThis morning, she asked me to wake her up at 9 am for a 10 am appointment. I started doing my usual wake-up routine, and she glared at me and went, \u201cOh, you\u2019re doing the thing where you annoy me into staying awake.\u201d I replied, \u201cYes honey, I don\u2019t want you to fall back asleep and miss your appointment.\u201d\n\nShe snapped, \u201cWell it doesn\u2019t matter what I say, does it? Because you\u2019re not going to listen to me and you\u2019re just going to assume I\u2019m going to fall back asleep, so you\u2019re going to keep annoying me to keep me awake anyway.\u201d\n\nI got mad and snapped back, \u201cWell I assume that because it\u2019s what happens all the time. But fine, if you don\u2019t want me to then I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d\n\nI went to the living room and sure enough, she fell back asleep and missed her appointment. I just let her miss it.\n\nShe got pretty upset at me for not waking her up again and letting her miss her appointment, and I replied that I did try to wake her up, but she snapped at me again and I was tired of being treated like shit in the mornings, so I\u2019m going to let her sleep from now on. \n\nWe\u2019re still at odds about it. I think I might be the asshole for letting her miss her appointment and threatening to stop waking her up when I know that\u2019ll probably cost her her job. But I\u2019m tired of being snapped at in the mornings, too.

Doubt she's always had someone willing to rub her arms and act like a human alarm clock all her life.", "NTA. Not at all. My husband is not a morning person, has even been diagnosed with sleep apnea. He struggles to get up and is grumpy in the mornings. My being a happy in the morning person annoys him, but he also loves me and would never ruin my morning like this. The most he has ever asked is that I tone down the singing and chatting for a bit on his rougher days. Why on earth is it ok for her to ruin your day be being verbally abusive every morning??? It sounds like she is just a jerk who does not have her filter on when she wakes up.", "Um. Yea NTA. She verbally abuses you every day because she\u2019s too much of a princess to use an alarm? Nooooo.", "NTA\n\nShe fails consistently as a adult with basic functioning, and her \"dont wake me up asshole, no, wake me up asshole, no dont wake me up asshole\" irresponsible attitude is usually something parents tries to nip it in the bud at 3-5 years old.\n\nToo bad her parents didn't.", "NTA.

You need to stop trying to wake her up at all. You also need to ask yourself why you needed to come onto Reddit to understand that what your girlfriend is doing to you is not okay, and you shouldn\u2019t be putting up with her obnoxious behavior.", "Nta. She seems to be very awake while saying all these mean things. Stop waking her up.", "Omg NTA . If she was single what would she do? You can bet your bottom dollar she would find a way to wake herself up.", "NTA, first and foremost let me say abuse is abuse regardless or form or intention. Also she is an adult it is HER job to wake herself up and get herself to her appointments on time. You are her partner notnher parent. What she's asking you to do is be responsible for her waking up and getting places on time... and so when she doesn't do that it falls on you and becomes your fault!!! This is not cool nor is it ever a good idea. If she's that heavy of a sleeper she needs to talk to a Dr about that it's her problem. And you ate just trying to help her and she snaps... there is no excuse in the book that even constitutes her behavior. Deff not the A!!!", "NTA - she is a grown ass woman she needs to learn how to get up on her own without having somebody wake her up. You are her partner not her parents", "NTA\n\nwhat would she do if you two weren't together? ask her roommates to wake her up every morning? or the neighbors? please.\n\nffs, she's 35. she needs to start being an adult. if that's going to cost her job... welp. that's the consequence to her actions.", "Didn't even finish, only read the first paragraph. NTA. At 35 she needs to grow up. Learn to wake up and get herself to work, unless you only have 1 vehicle. I'm a heavy sleeper and grumpy in the mornings.

Tbh, I would consider talking with her on finding another way to wake up. Nobody should have to take that behaviour in stride. She can be the most amazing partner the rest of the day but that hostility is still part of her personality. Nobody is perfect but part of loving you should include sheltering you from the morning grouch.", "Stop waking her up, she's a grown up and needs to learn how to adapt.

Now she\u2019s gonna have to do that all the time as a consequence of testing you like shit.", "NTA. She better figure it out quickly or start looking for a job that starts later. You are too nice. If it were me, I'd do to her what I did to my kids and pour a bowl a frozen marbles in bed with her. They follow her if she rolls away.   Once she is up gather the marbles and put them back in the freezer for next time.", "NTA.\n\nApologies only matter if there is also an attempt to change the behavior. The fact that this has been a repeated issue, and she apologizes, and then continues to be verbally abusive shows that her apologies are empty and shallow.\n\nIt\u2019s time to hold her accountable and remove yourself from being her personal wake up service.", "NTA.  She's a grown ass adult and you were doing her a huge favor by acting as her alarm clock and minder.  You don't owe her any sort of apology.  Tell her you're done playing that role since it's causing so much unpleasantness between you.  She can figure out how to meet her commitments and responsibilities.", "NTA, if she's going to be abusive while you're doing her a favor she can fuck off", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for waking her and making sure she isn't late for everything. She has been an adult for almost 18 years. She needs to figure it out for herself. Stop being her human alarm clock.\n\nI'm not a morning person and it's incredibly hard for me to get up in the morning. I've never made anyone else responsible for that and it's my fault if I sleep and am late for things.", "NTA if she was my gf it would be a bucket of cold water next time", "NTA at all. I\u2019m a heavy sleeper. This is on her. I sometimes ask my husband to way me up but I\u2019m not mean to him when he does. If you\u2019re just doing as she asks she can hardly expect you to put up with her being so pissy about it.", "NTA - You did what she asked. I get it, I struggle getting up in the morning too, but that doesn\u2019t make you responsible for her, especially when she demonstrates disdain for you when you are trying to help.", "NTA\n\nThere's only so much you can put up with.   \n\nShe's    35.   She is not a teen anymore.   You're not her mommy.   \n\nShe needs to figure this out because it's ridiculous for a middle aged person to act like this.    \n\nIt seems as if all this time she just depends on you and does not appreciate that you don't enjoy spending your mornings getting her ass out of bed.    \n\nShe should see a sleep specialist because this may be something  that can be fixed.", "NTA, if she can\u2019t get herself up in time for her own appointments, that is on her. I\u2019d stop waking her up entirely. Especially since she\u2019s so nasty to you when you\u2019re *doing the thing she asked you to do*. \n\nNah. I wouldn\u2019t deal with that, like\u2014-at all. If she gets fired, that\u2019s also on her. She\u2019s a grown adult, she needs to take responsibility.", "NTA. Your girlfriend needs to grow up, be an adult, and figure out how to get up in the morning without abusing you.", "NTA, also wild she\u2019s made it this long without figuring out a system that works for her. Also, if you\u2019re that grumpy in the morning, just be quiet lol", "NTA \n\n\nShe\u2019s 35. If she can\u2019t wake up on her own she should go see a doctor. You did as she asked, you tried to wake her, and then again when she told you to leave her alone. That\u2019s on her.", "NTA.

You deserve better.", "NTA to her but you're being a massive asshole to yourself for continuing to allow yourself to be verbally, mentally and emotionally abused by your asshole gf. \n\nYou deserve to be treated with high honor and appreciation.

At bare minimum, stop being her whipping boy!", "NTA.\n\nThough as a suggestion, ask her if she has DSPD. Or have her look into it and talk to a doctor to figure out if she does, because if this is the case then there are better solutions to this issue than you taking abuse from someone who supposedly loves you, which is wrong. It's her responsibility to wake up for work, appointments, etc., and while it's fine to ask for help, it's not your job at the end of the day. Thankfully the treatment of DSPD is fairly simple and not very expensive, but does rely on artifically controlling one's circadian rhythm, and if stopped it'll just go back to the patient's own \"normal\", so you do end up reliant on it as it can't be cured. \n\nI wasn't diagnosed until early adulthood, and I wish I had known sooner. The treatment options have significantly improved my life, and I function normally like everyone else now, not like I did previously, which is like your gf. DSPD is a genetic anomaly, and causes chronic sleep deprivation when the patient adheres to what we view as a normal sleep schedule. It's essentially chronic jetlag as a result of interrupting important sleep phases repeatedly, which normal people are out of by the time their alarms go off in the morning, and it has increased risks for heart disease and other serious health complications in the long run. Not to mention the strain on close relationships as you've unfortunately found out, but also increases the risk of losing jobs, and negatively affecting other areas of responsibility we have as people, so seeking treatment is of great importance.", "NTA.
