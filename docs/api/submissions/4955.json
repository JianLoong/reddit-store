Because she works earlier than I do, we have an arrangement where I wake her up and drive her to work in the morning. Per her request, I also make sure she wakes up for morning appointments, etc.\n\nI try to wake her up pretty slowly and gently, and rub her arms and talk to her to keep her awake until she gets up. If I don\u2019t, she\u2019ll fall right back asleep.\n\nThing is, she\u2019s often grumpy and pissed in the mornings. I try to take it in stride because she\u2019s not a morning person. But sometimes the stuff she says while waking up can get hurtful and mean. We always discuss it and she always apologizes later and clearly feels bad, but still.\n\nThis morning, she asked me to wake her up at 9 am for a 10 am appointment. I started doing my usual wake-up routine, and she glared at me and went, \u201cOh, you\u2019re doing the thing where you annoy me into staying awake.\u201d I replied, \u201cYes honey, I don\u2019t want you to fall back asleep and miss your appointment.\u201d\n\nShe snapped, \u201cWell it doesn\u2019t matter what I say, does it? Because you\u2019re not going to listen to me and you\u2019re just going to assume I\u2019m going to fall back asleep, so you\u2019re going to keep annoying me to keep me awake anyway.\u201d\n\nI got mad and snapped back, \u201cWell I assume that because it\u2019s what happens all the time. But fine, if you don\u2019t want me to then I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d\n\nI went to the living room and sure enough, she fell back asleep and missed her appointment. I just let her miss it.\n\nShe got pretty upset at me for not waking her up again and letting her miss her appointment, and I replied that I did try to wake her up, but she snapped at me again and I was tired of being treated like shit in the mornings, so I\u2019m going to let her sleep from now on. \n\nWe\u2019re still at odds about it. I think I might be the asshole for letting her miss her appointment and threatening to stop waking her up when I know that\u2019ll probably cost her her job. But I\u2019m tired of being snapped at in the mornings, too.

It's her responsibility to wake up for work, appointments, etc., and while it's fine to ask for help, it's not your job at the end of the day. Thankfully the treatment of DSPD is fairly simple and not very expensive, but does rely on artifically controlling one's circadian rhythm, and if stopped it'll just go back to the patient's own \"normal\", so you do end up reliant on it as it can't be cured. \n\nI wasn't diagnosed until early adulthood, and I wish I had known sooner. The treatment options have significantly improved my life, and I function normally like everyone else now, not like I did previously, which is like your gf. DSPD is a genetic anomaly, and causes chronic sleep deprivation when the patient adheres to what we view as a normal sleep schedule. It's essentially chronic jetlag as a result of interrupting important sleep phases repeatedly, which normal people are out of by the time their alarms go off in the morning, and it has increased risks for heart disease and other serious health complications in the long run. Not to mention the strain on close relationships as you've unfortunately found out, but also increases the risk of losing jobs, and negatively affecting other areas of responsibility we have as people, so seeking treatment is of great importance.", "NTA.

And I myself am diagnosed with type 1 narcolepsy, so I have been forced to read a lot of research about sleep science, so I'll offer a bit of information that might help you and your partner.\n\nWhat you're describing with regards to her difficulties waking up in the morning is called sleep inertia. For some people, it's nearly impossible to overcome unless they are, quite literally, annoyed into staying awake. It's not something they control. It's just that their brains are literally incapable of just waking up and staying awake unless something is forcing them to stay awake. It's not a character flaw, or laziness, or stubbornness. It takes me 15-20 minutes every morning to wake my spouse up to the point where they won't fall back to sleep. And sometimes, they say incredibly hurtful things to me during that process. What helps me is to first of all remember that **they're not actually thinking during those moments.** My spouse never - and I mean **never**  \\- says similar things to me except when I am waking them. This alone is evidence to me that while the words are coming out of their mouth, it's not them, in all their faculties, saying them. \n\nThings that can make the waking up process easier on **you** include removing the blankets from the bed, turning on the lights and opening the curtains/blinds, and getting as much bright light into the room as possible. You can even purchase daylight/light therapy lamps that are made specifically for people who have difficulty waking up. They are bright as fuck, and that light stimulates the brain to tell it, \"Hey, we need to start getting shit moving now!\" Removing the blankets adds another layer of discomfort to trying to curl back up in a cozy bed and doze back off.\n\nIt might also be a good idea to get your partner an appointment with a sleep specialist, who can determine if she has any kind of sleep disorder that could be contributing to her sleep inertia. Things like N24, IH, or even apnea can cause sleep inertia issues.\n\n[Here is a link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5337178/) with information and studies related to sleep inertia that you and/or your partner may want to look over and discuss with a sleep specialist. Best of luck to you!", "INFO: how did she wake herself up *before* living with you?", "NTA and I agree with the other comments here that you should stop. You're giving positive reinforcement and attention when you do the slow gently rub awake and talk to her, and she's abusing you in return. Her apologies mean nothing if she continues the behavior.\n\nBut...\n\nIf you do choose to continue being her alarm clock, perhaps a new morning routine is in order. Let's maybe use some negative reinforcement instead:  Walk in, kindly and loudly say \"honey, it's time to wake up,\" then take a big handful of blankets and strip them off the bed as you calmly walk back out into the living room with all her bedding. This puts you in the other room, safely out of range of her morning nastiness. Yeah, she may be pissed, but maybe after about the 3rd time, she'll decide she would rather grow tf up and not do this dance.

But KNOWING there's an alarm in the morning/next day makes me sleep lighter and actually ruins my sleep. The best thing I've done is getting a smart watch and use the vibrate function to wake me up. I've even stopped using a backup alarm since this works very well. \n\nAnother solution? Night- or evening work! Worked for me for 15 years - when I overslept, it was my free time it ate up and wouldn't make me late for work. A lot of heavy sleepers might just not be morning ppl. Even with meds I sleep bad if I go to bed too early.

I've already planned on going to the doctor to get this sorted out, and now I at least have some hope and have something to come to them with.\n\nSleep inertia is a very good way to describe it in my opinion. It always takes so much effort for me to get up in the morning, but it takes just as much effort to go to sleep every night. If my body isn't ready to go to sleep then there's nothing that will change that. It usually takes me laying in bed for an hour or so doing nothing before I finally go to sleep. If I go to sleep when I'm actually tired then I usually have a sleep schedule of staying awake for 24 hours and sleeping for 14 or so hours.\n\nSomething else I find interesting is that from the time I consider myself awake (which is when I'm conscious) to the time I go to bed, my brain is constantly on. I've noticed that of I wake up at the same time as someone, I'm almost immediately ready to talk about really complicated and mentally stimulating things when they normally need to wait 30 or 45 minutes. My girlfriend and I had a funny situation the other day where we (both in college for electrical engineering) were trying to solve a hard high level math problem before bed and couldn't figure it out. The next day, about 10 minutes after she started trying to wake me up, the answer to the problem clicked and I started trying to explain it to her. It took about another 45 minutes before she was finally willing and awake enough to listen to my explanation. I'm not sure if this is related to sleep interia or not, but it's something related that I've encountered about sleep that no one else seems to experience.\n\nThank you so much again for your reply! I'm so happy that I finally have at least somewhat of an answer to this. I'm excited to start doing my own research on it.

I still remember very fondly the feeling of their little cute paws walking on my arms and face, and how they'd sniff all over trying to find the breakfast that was waiting for me!\n\n\nI always considered it a cheap tactic because she knew I loved those hamsters immensely, and I wouldn't have made a single move that could potentially endanger them, so when they were walking all over me she could yank the covers and I wouldn't get them right back as I normally would have, so in many cases it worked to jerk me awake to make sure the pet was not in distress or jumping off the bed. Sometimes it backfired though, as I'd just freeze still (to not squish the hamham) and the hamster would leave me alone and wonder off to the rest of the bed every time my mom repositioned them, so I would fall back asleep lol.", "fixed! thanks for mentioning!", "just edited, thanks!", "No but thats not really what you said, you said that people will \"just figure out another system\". I'm just saying thats not always true. \n\nAnd tbh the part where she is aggressively rude is where she becomes TA. Wanting your partner to help you with something isnt wrong, and neither is expecting to be woken up by somebody who agreed to do so. And yeah if someone agreed with me to wake me up, and didn't, I would blame them yeah. \n\nI also wouldnt snap at them and indeed explicitly say to wake me up but I dont think their **initial** agreement is wrong or unfair.", "My kids just yell mom from the doorway or the other room \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I was always a light sleeper, it got worse after kids. My hubby would shake my foot and jumo back because he got kicked at a cpl times. Luckily he's quicker than me and knows martial arts so, he was good at blocking me before I hit him. He only got punched the first time because he wasn't expecting me to swing on him when he went to hug me in my sleep lol", "I said they figure out a different system **without pretending it\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem**. Read the full sentence. And don\u2019t act like I am saying it\u2019s never ok to ask someone to help, the gf is hurling abuse at her partner and still expects him to keep doing her a favour. That is making it his problem 10 times over. If I was cooking dinner for guests and they came in and told me it was disgusting and terrible, you think I\u2019m gonna keep doing it? You don\u2019t get to be angry at someone you bully not coming through for you. I wake my husband up all the time, he isn\u2019t making it my problem because I wake him, he says thanks and that\u2019s the end of it. My sister is deaf, she\u2019s figured out flashing light and vibrating alarms too. People adapt, they don\u2019t get to hurl insults at someone helping them.", "Well it sounds like knowing martial arts comes in handy! My stepdad also learned the hard way, he asked how my sister and I wake her up. I had to explain that it's gotta be like a level 10 emergency for one of us to go and willingly wake her up. Nothing is that important that it can't wait until she gets up. \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s part of why my partner and I have separate bedrooms. He sets like twenty fricken\u2019 alarms\u2014 and then hits snooze on every one a million times! There\u2019s nothing more annoying than getting my day started to the sound of *every* goddamned Apple alarm tone in the world!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 that was MY mom!!! You DID NOT wake her up for ANYTHING!!! I don't wake up angry, I wake up scared and panicked when woken up suddenly by being touched and swing or kick in self defense (in my sleep addled brain)because it happens in my dream. For example, I used to have a recurring nightmare about dead people trying to get me. It would be all black and just dead hands reaching for me and when I was touched in real life, one of them would grab me in my dream so I'd start fighting in my dream, and real life too apparently."]}
