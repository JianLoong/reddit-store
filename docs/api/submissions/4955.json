Because she works earlier than I do, we have an arrangement where I wake her up and drive her to work in the morning. Per her request, I also make sure she wakes up for morning appointments, etc.\n\nI try to wake her up pretty slowly and gently, and rub her arms and talk to her to keep her awake until she gets up. If I don\u2019t, she\u2019ll fall right back asleep.\n\nThing is, she\u2019s often grumpy and pissed in the mornings. I try to take it in stride because she\u2019s not a morning person. But sometimes the stuff she says while waking up can get hurtful and mean. We always discuss it and she always apologizes later and clearly feels bad, but still.\n\nThis morning, she asked me to wake her up at 9 am for a 10 am appointment. I started doing my usual wake-up routine, and she glared at me and went, \u201cOh, you\u2019re doing the thing where you annoy me into staying awake.\u201d I replied, \u201cYes honey, I don\u2019t want you to fall back asleep and miss your appointment.\u201d\n\nShe snapped, \u201cWell it doesn\u2019t matter what I say, does it? Because you\u2019re not going to listen to me and you\u2019re just going to assume I\u2019m going to fall back asleep, so you\u2019re going to keep annoying me to keep me awake anyway.\u201d\n\nI got mad and snapped back, \u201cWell I assume that because it\u2019s what happens all the time. But fine, if you don\u2019t want me to then I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d\n\nI went to the living room and sure enough, she fell back asleep and missed her appointment. I just let her miss it.\n\nShe got pretty upset at me for not waking her up again and letting her miss her appointment, and I replied that I did try to wake her up, but she snapped at me again and I was tired of being treated like shit in the mornings, so I\u2019m going to let her sleep from now on. \n\nWe\u2019re still at odds about it. I think I might be the asshole for letting her miss her appointment and threatening to stop waking her up when I know that\u2019ll probably cost her her job. But I\u2019m tired of being snapped at in the mornings, too.

It's her responsibility to wake up for work, appointments, etc., and while it's fine to ask for help, it's not your job at the end of the day. Thankfully the treatment of DSPD is fairly simple and not very expensive, but does rely on artifically controlling one's circadian rhythm, and if stopped it'll just go back to the patient's own \"normal\", so you do end up reliant on it as it can't be cured. \n\nI wasn't diagnosed until early adulthood, and I wish I had known sooner. The treatment options have significantly improved my life, and I function normally like everyone else now, not like I did previously, which is like your gf. DSPD is a genetic anomaly, and causes chronic sleep deprivation when the patient adheres to what we view as a normal sleep schedule. It's essentially chronic jetlag as a result of interrupting important sleep phases repeatedly, which normal people are out of by the time their alarms go off in the morning, and it has increased risks for heart disease and other serious health complications in the long run. Not to mention the strain on close relationships as you've unfortunately found out, but also increases the risk of losing jobs, and negatively affecting other areas of responsibility we have as people, so seeking treatment is of great importance.", "NTA.

And I myself am diagnosed with type 1 narcolepsy, so I have been forced to read a lot of research about sleep science, so I'll offer a bit of information that might help you and your partner.\n\nWhat you're describing with regards to her difficulties waking up in the morning is called sleep inertia. For some people, it's nearly impossible to overcome unless they are, quite literally, annoyed into staying awake. It's not something they control. It's just that their brains are literally incapable of just waking up and staying awake unless something is forcing them to stay awake. It's not a character flaw, or laziness, or stubbornness. It takes me 15-20 minutes every morning to wake my spouse up to the point where they won't fall back to sleep. And sometimes, they say incredibly hurtful things to me during that process. What helps me is to first of all remember that **they're not actually thinking during those moments.** My spouse never - and I mean **never**  \\- says similar things to me except when I am waking them. This alone is evidence to me that while the words are coming out of their mouth, it's not them, in all their faculties, saying them. \n\nThings that can make the waking up process easier on **you** include removing the blankets from the bed, turning on the lights and opening the curtains/blinds, and getting as much bright light into the room as possible. You can even purchase daylight/light therapy lamps that are made specifically for people who have difficulty waking up. They are bright as fuck, and that light stimulates the brain to tell it, \"Hey, we need to start getting shit moving now!\" Removing the blankets adds another layer of discomfort to trying to curl back up in a cozy bed and doze back off.\n\nIt might also be a good idea to get your partner an appointment with a sleep specialist, who can determine if she has any kind of sleep disorder that could be contributing to her sleep inertia. Things like N24, IH, or even apnea can cause sleep inertia issues.\n\n[Here is a link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5337178/) with information and studies related to sleep inertia that you and/or your partner may want to look over and discuss with a sleep specialist. Best of luck to you!", "INFO: how did she wake herself up *before* living with you?", "NTA and I agree with the other comments here that you should stop. You're giving positive reinforcement and attention when you do the slow gently rub awake and talk to her, and she's abusing you in return. Her apologies mean nothing if she continues the behavior.\n\nBut...\n\nIf you do choose to continue being her alarm clock, perhaps a new morning routine is in order. Let's maybe use some negative reinforcement instead:  Walk in, kindly and loudly say \"honey, it's time to wake up,\" then take a big handful of blankets and strip them off the bed as you calmly walk back out into the living room with all her bedding. This puts you in the other room, safely out of range of her morning nastiness. Yeah, she may be pissed, but maybe after about the 3rd time, she'll decide she would rather grow tf up and not do this dance.

Let her figure it out herself until she gets an attitude adjustment.", "NTA,\n\nHow did she manage waking up before you got together?\n\nI highly doubt that she can't wake up to alarms. It's more than likely that she just doesn't want to.", "Wtf is she a toddler or something?", "Ugh. My mother had 3 different alarms. Digital, clock radio and an old school travel wind up that could be heard down the block. I *still* had to help rouse her 5 days outta 7. I *hate* being responsible for getting other people up. NTA OP. Let her sleep. She\u2019ll learn eventually, but if the learning costs her job *do not* cover her butt financially. She\u2019ll effin\u2019 sleep all day while you go to work.", "NTA - if you broke up would she lose her job?  Is she that much of a non functional adult?  Because that's pretty pathetic.  You should not have to face her abuse every morning because she's too lazy to get her ass out of bed.  This is Not. Your. Problem.  If she wants to make it your problem, find someone else.", "Nta and I 100 percent think u should end the relationship with no hesitation.", "NTA", "I am a heavy sleeper that can sleep for hours with my alarm on the other side of the room. I will wake up, walk there, hit snooze, go back. I am also incredibly cranky in the mornings.\n\nYet. I wake myself up to get to whatever appointments I need to or start my waking alarm a few hours before I have to get to my apt so I can make peace with having to wake up. Sometimes my boyfriend helps me with it by talking to me and telling me to get out of bed.\n\nNever would I imagine berating him and saying such things to him for doing me a favor?? What you described right there is verbal abuse and is just not okay in any shape or form. I have extreme amount of hatred for everything when I initially wake up but I could never say such things for somebody I love who is doing me a favor.", "NTA. Look, I suck at waking up when I actually can sleep, bit I'm certainly not an A H when I ask someone to do me the favor of helping me. I'm 42 & my guy is 33 and I promise you that I'm thankful and grateful for every little thing he does for me. Your relationship sounds pretty one-sided.", "NTA. You are enabling her though. She sounds like an awful, mean, irresponsible woman. Let her face the natural consequences of her actions and she\u2019ll learn. If not, drop her she\u2019s a liability", "NTA. I have a friend like this. Ugh it is super annoying and she's also super pissy in the mornings. When we travel together I leave and do my own thing. Haha if she wants to go she can figure it out and wake up.on time.", "NTA. If she wants you to do her favors and help her out, she should maybe not be an ignorant and rude AH. Crazy idea, I know...\n\nI'm not a morning person, have a terrible time waking up early every day, and am a terrible mood when I do so. And yet, I manage to not insult the person who wakes me up and/or treat like them like sh*t. Because I'm not a rude dumb*ss.", "Seriously. I used to be horrible for oversleeping, and turning off alarms and falling back to sleep. Somehow when it matters now I manage to get up 99% of the time.", "But I was going to say. How the hell did she wake up before she and the girlfriend were together? This time for her to grow up and act like a goddamn responsible adult for a change.", "I agree that OP is NTA, because he doesn't deserve to be GF's punching bag, but as someone who often needs a human alarm clock, I'd like to chime in.\n\nI have a sleep disorder (somewhat rare and frequently misdiagnosed or just missed altogether by healthcare professionals) that I've lived with for a long time but only known I have for about two years. When I was single, I had to plan my whole life around \"not being a morning person\". I had to quit jobs that I couldn't make it to in the morning. I had to drop out of classes that started too early. I could never schedule myself for an 8AM doctor's appointment, even if the next available afternoon appointment was weeks away.\n\nNow that I'm married, I still have to make accommodations for my condition. I work freelance and almost never have to be on a job before noon. *But* I can schedule an early appointment if I need to, because someone who loves me will make sure I get there. We have a beautiful son, which is only possible because my partner is willing to be up with him in the mornings, knowing that I can't always do that and I'll pick up the slack elsewhere.\n\nNone of this is to defend OP's girlfriend for treating him this way. Even if she does have a sleep disorder, she needs to seek help for it and find a proper balance that doesn't include verbally abusing her partner. But I often see threads like this devolving into shitting on people who struggle with sleep related issues, and I wanted to offer an alternate perspective.", "So - OP does what gf asked her to do, and regularly gets shit for it?  Just stop doing it. My husband got into that phase where he bought socks that looked identical but weren't, AND they were marked as \"right\" and \"left\". Got annoyed when I got them mixed up a couple of times while putting away the laundry. Guess who got asked to sort his own effing socks, and then bought a bunch of actually identical and same-footed ones? NTA, but your gf needs a serious relationship wake-up call.", "I have a friend who is 31 and lives alone, her mother calls her every morning to make sure she wakes up. If she doesn\u2019t answer she will drive to her home and let herself in to wake her. \n\nIt astounds me, but I\u2019ve witnessed it first hand when she\u2019s stayed with me. She will sleep through alarms at full blast. I once let it go for an hour to see if she\u2019d stir at all - she was dead to the world. However once you wake her once she doesn\u2019t go back to sleep.", "My husband and I used to be the same (pre-kids), I hated getting up in the morning and he bounced out of bed like a Disney character. I was never rude to him but would occasionally ask him to not talk to me for 5 minutes while I sorted my head out. OP, you\u2019re NTA but your partner needs to get her head out of her ass.", "> \u201cWell it doesn\u2019t matter what I say, does it? Because you\u2019re not going to listen to me and you\u2019re just going to assume I\u2019m going to fall back asleep, so you\u2019re going to keep annoying me to keep me awake anyway.\u201d\n\n\nLike what the hell else can he do in response to that other than walk away.", "At this point, my bladder usually wakes me up a few minutes before my alarm. I was never a morning person, but even on my days off I'm conditioned to pee at around 7am.", "My parents used a frozen can of Dr. Pepper and ball bearings out of the freezer on my sister, it worked well.", "If she still really wants to help her she could just go turn on music in the other room. Maybe something she likes, or maybe something she hates. I'm thinking Venga Boys- We Like to Party (personally I'd love waking up to that song. You cant be mad)", "He did wake her up, she just chose to do her usual thing when he did. She was at a point she could make a conscious decision", "Yeah it's something you should appreciate your partner does for you, not something you feel entitled to. Before my SO moved in, I needed to set Google home speakers outside the room to go off so I would have to get up to turn them off, and I'd still end up late. Obviously it would be annoying to have the speakers blaring now so he wakes me up, but that's a bonus, not an expectation. If I was uncontrollably mean to him in the mornings for it I would book appointments with doctors and therapists to figure out what's going on and how to improve it.", "Everyone should try my brother's method in which he has alarms every 10 minutes since 6:30am to wake up at 9am. I'm not joking, I wake up at 7 am and I can hear my brother's alarm through the door.", "Or maybe all the single people with this problem can't get to work, can't get anywhere, and just starve and die alone and unknown, still in their bed... That's why we never hear of them...", "I set two alarms and hubby comes to kiss me goodbye in mornings. I struggle to get up with that. But I don't blame partner if I fall asleep again. I blame myself.  And I have never given him crap for waking me. \n\nSo I don't get it.", "I do know permanency late people and people in jobs where you can come in super late.", "I have three alarms in the span of 10 minutes. The secret is that each one is further away from my grasp.\n\n1st: regular alarm clock - well within my reach, can slam it off in my sleep\n\n2nd: my phone - usually slightly further away, but depends where and when I fall asleep\n\n3rd: a tiny alarm clock out of my direct reach\n\nNormally 1 or 2 are enough, but sometimes alarm 3 saved my ass.", ">I would love it if someone woke me up by gentle rubbing my arm and whispering in my ear. \n\nExcept when you live alone... o are in jail.", ">I would love it if someone woke me up by gentle rubbing my arm and whispering in my ear.\n\nI'm pretty sure I would hate that, but to each their own. Give me a regular alarm clock any day. Failing that, just yell \"Wake up!\" and turn on the lights. I'm with OP's girlfriend that the gentle wake-ups would be incredibly annoying for someone who has a hard time first thing in the morning.", "I used to set my alarm clock to a weird amount of minutes off, like 7 late. Then whe I woke up I had to remember what it was and then math the real time.", "My stepdad used to have to shake the bunk bed, flash the lights and yell until I got up when I was younger. Ah, good times.", "Would make more sense for him to just work second shift. Or like noon to 9", "Me too. I still oversleep easily if it's not \"important\", but now I have some sleeping pills that help me to fall asleep early so I can get enough sleep and wake up on time. Too bad that the pills make me extremely zombie-like for the next day, but I use them only in emergencies.\n\nWithout medication and knowing that I absolutely HAVE to wake up early I'm usually so scared of oversleeping that I end up staying awake the whole night. I might be on time, sure, but I look like and feel like I have the worst hangover. Not very professional.", "For real. She has pushed OP into the role of being her mommy. OP needs to take a reeeeeally long look at what he's in for if he stays with this woman. (Spoiler: the verbal abuse will not magically get better.)", "also alarm clock that slowly gets brighter (light) or the app alarmy where you have to solve maths to get the alarm to stop.", "I was going to respond with the exact same thing. Let her figure out how to wake yourself up as a single person. The image I get in my mind of what this girl must be like is not the kind of person that should be able to keep a man.", "Buy a trumpet.", "Preferably pack his crap up and leave, not entertaining her BS shenanigans.", "I'm a super heavy sleeper, as in once when I was a teenager, my older brother tried to wake me up and thought I overdosed on something (when I have no history of drug abuse) and called my parents because he was scared because I couldn't wake up. \n\nNow that I have a job and have to fend for myself, my anxiety about oversleeping jolts me awake every few hours. Alarm clocks still don't wake me up. The fear of unemployment and homelessness does.", "Wait, are you telling me that you took responsibility for one of your own issues and found a way to solve it without putting the people you love in an uncomfortable position? I didn't know it was possible, lmao", "I do this except I have an alarm set every ten minutes, then nine, then eight, all the way down until there is a different sound blaring every minute for the next hour. Plus, I have a clock that glows ridiculously bright into my face and vibrates nonstop until I turn it off with a series of buttons I have to remember. It pisses me off, but it wakes my ass up.", "I set 3 alarms and have my smart plug turn a lamp on 15 minutes before the first alarm \n\nUnless I've had a terrible night's sleep, I'm usually up and out of bed just after the 2nd alarm", "I don\u2019t startle awake, but your comment reminded me of the time my best friend woke me up from where I\u2019d fallen asleep on her sofa by sticking her finger in my ear, and she says I punched her in my sleep.  She showed me bloody tissues in the bathroom trash can and kept her physical distance from me for a while. \ud83d\ude02", "My dad did this too!  He called it *invigoration time.*", "My dad used to startle me awake that way to clean.  I got to the point where I wouldn't wake up but instead shout at him that I was cleaning something while still asleep. Then I'd wake up immediately and get pissed because I knew I yelled something absolutely stupid at him. He found this intensely amusing.  I never did it once in the years since I moved out.  Until fast forward 30 years when one morning, my husband startled me awake by opening the drapes and I sat up to yell at him that I was cleaning the aquarium.  Scared the hell out of him.", "Mine also threw a cold wet flannel on me. It was the absolute worst.\n\nNow I have a baby and a toddler. They have trained me well. I wake up at a pin drop", "My mom just would crinkle stuff and frankly it\u2019s impossible to sleep wondering what she\u2019s getting into in your bedroom as a teen", "I hated mornings. I'd sleep in til 1 or 2pm. So I just worked overnights.", "I have a clock that simulates a sunrise. Takes half an hour to fully blaze, and blaze it does; then it makes loud bird noises. Great stuff if you tend to sleep more in winter due to lack of actual daylight, or have seasonal affect disorder, or both.", "OP is a woman, and by saying ESH, you\u2019re calling her an asshole when she\u2019s done nothing wrong. Even for the purposes of this sub, OP is not being an AH, even to herself, because she clearly doesn\u2019t realize that it\u2019s verbal abuse.

I had one a few years ago where the vibration alarm was not noticeable enough.", "K, the [one I have](https://smile.amazon.com/Philips-Simulation-Headspace-Subscription-HF3520/dp/B0093162RM/) is on the more expensive side. I can't answer for the performance of any others, and there are lots of less costly options. Check reviews. I can vouch for the brand I linked, they have many other options that don't cost a fortune.\n\nIf you have SAD, these things are worth it. *Huge* difference.
