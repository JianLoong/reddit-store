Because she works earlier than I do, we have an arrangement where I wake her up and drive her to work in the morning. Per her request, I also make sure she wakes up for morning appointments, etc.\n\nI try to wake her up pretty slowly and gently, and rub her arms and talk to her to keep her awake until she gets up. If I don\u2019t, she\u2019ll fall right back asleep.\n\nThing is, she\u2019s often grumpy and pissed in the mornings. I try to take it in stride because she\u2019s not a morning person. But sometimes the stuff she says while waking up can get hurtful and mean. We always discuss it and she always apologizes later and clearly feels bad, but still.\n\nThis morning, she asked me to wake her up at 9 am for a 10 am appointment. I started doing my usual wake-up routine, and she glared at me and went, \u201cOh, you\u2019re doing the thing where you annoy me into staying awake.\u201d I replied, \u201cYes honey, I don\u2019t want you to fall back asleep and miss your appointment.\u201d\n\nShe snapped, \u201cWell it doesn\u2019t matter what I say, does it? Because you\u2019re not going to listen to me and you\u2019re just going to assume I\u2019m going to fall back asleep, so you\u2019re going to keep annoying me to keep me awake anyway.\u201d\n\nI got mad and snapped back, \u201cWell I assume that because it\u2019s what happens all the time. But fine, if you don\u2019t want me to then I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d\n\nI went to the living room and sure enough, she fell back asleep and missed her appointment. I just let her miss it.\n\nShe got pretty upset at me for not waking her up again and letting her miss her appointment, and I replied that I did try to wake her up, but she snapped at me again and I was tired of being treated like shit in the mornings, so I\u2019m going to let her sleep from now on. \n\nWe\u2019re still at odds about it. I think I might be the asshole for letting her miss her appointment and threatening to stop waking her up when I know that\u2019ll probably cost her her job. But I\u2019m tired of being snapped at in the mornings, too.

Or have her look into it and talk to a doctor to figure out if she does, because if this is the case then there are better solutions to this issue than you taking abuse from someone who supposedly loves you, which is wrong. It's her responsibility to wake up for work, appointments, etc., and while it's fine to ask for help, it's not your job at the end of the day. Thankfully the treatment of DSPD is fairly simple and not very expensive, but does rely on artifically controlling one's circadian rhythm, and if stopped it'll just go back to the patient's own \"normal\", so you do end up reliant on it as it can't be cured. \n\nI wasn't diagnosed until early adulthood, and I wish I had known sooner. The treatment options have significantly improved my life, and I function normally like everyone else now, not like I did previously, which is like your gf. DSPD is a genetic anomaly, and causes chronic sleep deprivation when the patient adheres to what we view as a normal sleep schedule. It's essentially chronic jetlag as a result of interrupting important sleep phases repeatedly, which normal people are out of by the time their alarms go off in the morning, and it has increased risks for heart disease and other serious health complications in the long run. Not to mention the strain on close relationships as you've unfortunately found out, but also increases the risk of losing jobs, and negatively affecting other areas of responsibility we have as people, so seeking treatment is of great importance.", "NTA.

And I myself am diagnosed with type 1 narcolepsy, so I have been forced to read a lot of research about sleep science, so I'll offer a bit of information that might help you and your partner.\n\nWhat you're describing with regards to her difficulties waking up in the morning is called sleep inertia. For some people, it's nearly impossible to overcome unless they are, quite literally, annoyed into staying awake. It's not something they control. It's just that their brains are literally incapable of just waking up and staying awake unless something is forcing them to stay awake. It's not a character flaw, or laziness, or stubbornness. It takes me 15-20 minutes every morning to wake my spouse up to the point where they won't fall back to sleep. And sometimes, they say incredibly hurtful things to me during that process. What helps me is to first of all remember that **they're not actually thinking during those moments.** My spouse never - and I mean **never**  \\- says similar things to me except when I am waking them. This alone is evidence to me that while the words are coming out of their mouth, it's not them, in all their faculties, saying them. \n\nThings that can make the waking up process easier on **you** include removing the blankets from the bed, turning on the lights and opening the curtains/blinds, and getting as much bright light into the room as possible. You can even purchase daylight/light therapy lamps that are made specifically for people who have difficulty waking up. They are bright as fuck, and that light stimulates the brain to tell it, \"Hey, we need to start getting shit moving now!\" Removing the blankets adds another layer of discomfort to trying to curl back up in a cozy bed and doze back off.\n\nIt might also be a good idea to get your partner an appointment with a sleep specialist, who can determine if she has any kind of sleep disorder that could be contributing to her sleep inertia. Things like N24, IH, or even apnea can cause sleep inertia issues.\n\n[Here is a link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5337178/) with information and studies related to sleep inertia that you and/or your partner may want to look over and discuss with a sleep specialist. Best of luck to you!", "INFO: how did she wake herself up *before* living with you?", "NTA and I agree with the other comments here that you should stop. You're giving positive reinforcement and attention when you do the slow gently rub awake and talk to her, and she's abusing you in return. Her apologies mean nothing if she continues the behavior.\n\nBut...\n\nIf you do choose to continue being her alarm clock, perhaps a new morning routine is in order. Let's maybe use some negative reinforcement instead:  Walk in, kindly and loudly say \"honey, it's time to wake up,\" then take a big handful of blankets and strip them off the bed as you calmly walk back out into the living room with all her bedding. This puts you in the other room, safely out of range of her morning nastiness. Yeah, she may be pissed, but maybe after about the 3rd time, she'll decide she would rather grow tf up and not do this dance. (For bonus points, turn on the bedroom light on your way out the door.)\n\nIn the interests of communication, you may need to let her know in advance that this will be your new tactic. \"Darling GF, I love you and never want to annoy you. I'm so sorry that you've been feeling that way in the mornings.

For example, instead of trying to coddle her awake you could wake her and then get up and turn on music fairly loudly, make coffee, etc etc - in other words, change the environment from a peaceful sleepy one to something she can't sleep through. She'll still be bad tempered but at least you'll be in a different room. She should also go to bed earlier!

My mom used to pour ice water on me in bed in the mornings for school and even that wouldn\u2019t work. NONE of that was intentional or conscious. And no one around us EVER suggested a sleep specialist might be relevant.\n\nI could agree with either ESH or NAH, because it doesn\u2019t sound like the GF is consciously choosing this to me. But I don\u2019t need YOU to agree with me, and there\u2019s zero reason why you should need me to agree with you. Our life experiences are different and lead us to judge the situation differently. Agree to disagree and move on.", "Yes, I'm heavy sleeper and I experience that a lot but it's my problem and I don't act like an asshole to other people for it. OP is not obligated to wake up her girlfriend especially if she is insulting and demeaning her. She should be freaking grateful.\n\nNTA. End of discussion.", "There\u2019s a difference between being a heavy sleeper and \u201cwaking up\u201d enough to fully form sentences without actually being awake. That\u2019s a sign of a medical condition affecting sleep. The fact that you sleep deeply is not comparable to a condition that literally requires treatment.", "That doesn't change anything in described story in the post. Her girlfriend can seek medical help. If she wants to treat OP like she does she doesn't deserve any help even if she is apologetic after. She is the only asshole in that story."]}
