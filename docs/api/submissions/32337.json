The absolute gall of your mother and brother.\n\nDon't risk your relationship with your son just to cover your mother's backside. The real answer is for your mother to pull her head in so that your son has no bad behavior to pick up on. It really is that simple.\n\nTell your mother that and point out that your son isn't stupid -- if she keeps on saying those kind of things he will notice anyway. Lying for her sake won't even work and you're not damaging your relationship with your son just because she can't stop baring her fangs at you in his sight. If she does that and hisses like a snake, has a forked tongue like a snake -- your son will think she's a snake. What does she expect?", "Holy shit someone actually used gaslight correctly.\n\nNTA. Your child is not stupid and even if you DID say he was just imagining things there\u2019s a zero percent chance he would even believe that. Kind of crazy your mom got called tf out and her first idea is to trick her grandson rather than\u2026..idk, try to be a better parent?", "Holy shit, NTA! \n\nAlso, extra points for telling him that he doesn't have to fight your battles while still acknowledging that he understood the situation correctly. Well done!", "NTA! You are in the right not to gaslight your son. It touches my heart that such a young person can stand up for his mom!", "\"I'm not going to lie to my son. Even if I *was* willing to do that to him, it wouldn't work, since what you do to me is perfectly obvious. If you don't want him to have a bad impression of your behavior, then you need to improve your behavior towards me.\"\n\nNTA, and good for you for breaking the patterns you were raised with \n\nAs far as your brother goes, he should *also* be told in no uncertain terms that lying to your son will do nothing to \"reduce tension\", and the only thing that *would* do that is for your mother to be on better behavior. If your brother actually cares about having a more peaceful familial situation, he should be trying to help your mother to stop engaging in bad behavior", "NTA...There is no reason to be anything but completely honest here.  Your mother and brother need to face the truth and all of the awkward feelings involved with that.", "NTA and what a great mum you are.

And kudos on the great, smart kid you raised.", "NTA", "Nope. He is too old to gaslight\u2026.13 yr old will not believe it and you wil alienate him.

Specifically, they have to be confronted in a manner where they're mentally cornered and can no longer deny what's right in front of them.\n\nEncourage what your son is doing.
