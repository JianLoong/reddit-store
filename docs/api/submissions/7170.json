I have an attorney and I checked with him on everything I\u2019ve done before I did them. I have all of the required permits. I\u2019m here because the entire town is mad at me.\n\nA few months ago I bought some land with a man made pond on it. Where it\u2019s located there are no lakes within a 3 or 4 hour drive and this pond is large so over the years it\u2019s been a popular hang out spot for the locals. The previous owner stocked it with bass and bluegills every year so the town held an annual fishing contest there in the spring. I don\u2019t live in this town but knew of the pond because I\u2019ve been to a couple of the fishing contests there. When the land went up for sale, I couldn\u2019t believe it and bought it right away.\n\nThe land had been in the previous owner\u2019s family for generations. About a year ago, a kid got hurt on the pond and he got sued. He lost the suit so he had to sell the land to pay for the cost of the suit and judgment.

Anyway, I\u2019m very good at learning from other people\u2019s mistakes so as soon as it became mine, I had contractors on there fencing off the entire area and putting up no trespassing signs. Now the entire town is mad at me. \n\nPeople I don\u2019t know start arguments with me while I\u2019m out and about in the town. Unfortunately this also includes my wife\u2019s family because they live in this.

I\u2019m sure everyone in the town know why the land was sold. It\u2019s a town of about 10,000 and word gets around.\n\n2. I talked about liability release with my attorney before buying it and we decided that would have been a nightmare since I don\u2019t live there and there\u2019s no way for me to make sure that everyone who steps on the land signed a waiver.\n\n3. The previous owner was a farmer so the land is absolutely beautiful with most of it cleared while having a couple of small forests. It\u2019s almost 200 acres and the pond is about 10 acres. I bought it because I love the outdoors and this is my little piece of heaven where I can camp and fish whenever I want to. Another reason is that companies are moving to this area so it\u2019s also an investment.

If there is a feature on your land that is reasonably foreseeable to attract children and could reasonably foreseeably injure said children, then the land owner is liable if the land is not appropriately protected/fenced. \n\nOP is right to fence the land given an injury is /extremely/ foreseeable, given past injury. It\u2019s uninsurable otherwise and unless OP paid cash, OP\u2019s lender would require insurance. \n\nOP NTA", "Yes, absolutely.  In fact, there is a university course called \"Reclamation of Drastically Disturbed Lands\".  The Nature Conservancy does this also.  They buy or have donated land that has been at least partially developed and they return it to native vegetation for the wildlife living on it.", "Its probably not wise to assume the future HOAs will allow native plants if they aren\u2019t cookie cutter enough", "It absolutely could.", "It generally takes a lot of work and care to return native plants to an area, due to competition from invasive plants that grow faster and suck up light, food, water. Ivy and blackberries and bindweed, among a list of others, are terrible and have to be constantly removed for native plants to recover their foothold.", "Sorry. Comment wasn't in reference to the fence (that makes a lot of sense) but slitting it off for development.", "Oh interesting, I didn't know that. It makes an unfortunate amount of sense though. Thanks for the info!", "Any time you can pull ivy, do it! Even if you can't perfectly eradicate an invasive plant from an area, every little bit helps.", "NTA but Bruhhh you better be very careful. This literal exact scenario is happening to a client of mine in Colorado and the towns people complained until the County sued the landowner for \u201cadverse possession\u201d and everything you\u2019re spelling out could give your town/county precedent to do the exact same thing\n\nSee Tik Tok here: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRgVrRoJ/ (her entire TT is about the legal battle over this issue.)\n\nNews story here: https://www.9news.com/amp/article/news/local/colorado-homeowner-blocks-bear-creek-access/73-1bb09893-e38d-4d83-8f4d-142dfa20aa57", "Imagine instead of 'regular redditor' buying some good ole nature, it's Elon or Bezos buying 200 acres to speculate, parcel off to sell, and banning townies from continuing a tradition. He doesn't even live there or is there enough to care. Yea ok, the town of 10k people can pool together their Christmas money and buy this rightttt\n\nReddit be like 'eat the rich!' while also bootlicking someone who buys 200 acres to profit while pissing off a whole town.", "I don\u2019t think you understood when he said investment. He bought it to go camping and fishing and to keep other big corpos from grabbing it. He does deserve it since he paid for it. The town can go yell at the kid for gettin hurt. Kids fault.", "Yeah but why would you want to own a pond that everyone is mad about you owning? It's just going to get vandalized", "\"Turn around, don't drown.\" - That's some very awesome 90s PSA you got there.", "I would be more convinced if it wasn't literally the reason the land was sold in the first place. \n\nNow, maybe we're missing details about how OP outbid the town or some group of residents that wanted to keep it as the hangout spot, but my God, you don't bite the hand that feeds you and then get upset when it goes away.", "Well who would buy this liability & let people keep using it? It's not just 'your house your rules' logic letting people use it is the DIRECT reason the last owner had to sell", "he is the asshole for buying it.", "Exactly. He literally says it\u2019s 200 acres of beautiful forest and wildlife, and then that he\u2019d also be willing to selling it to developers. OP, YTA.", "The last guy who tried to allow the community in got sued to hell. Why would anyone risk that?", "Man it\u2019s almost as if he doesn\u2019t want someone to get hurt and sue him for money \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e", "They still can. If it\u2019s really important, the town government can (try to) buy it from OP or even take it through eminent domain and pay a fair value for it (in the US, anyway). Doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s unfortunate for the people of the town, but *someone* had to pay off the lawsuit and *someone* has to bear the risks going forward. If the town doesn\u2019t want to do that, they can\u2019t expect to get the benefits of the land either.", "Yes, whoever sued to begin with - whether it was a person or an insurance company - is the biggest asshole in this mess. I don't disagree with that at all.", "Someone else should've bought the cake then", "Yes, that's why I leaded with he doesn't have to do anything. But some people value their relationship with the community", "Then u buy the property.", "\"They're saying factually true things about us and we don't like it\"", "When I lived in Europe I noticed that, it was quite refreshing to see people held responsible for their own actions. Sign says keep out, someone doesn't and gets hurt, oh well, their problem.", "It absolutely is a health insurance issue: insurance pushes the prices of treatment so high, only the very richest could afford to pay them."]}
