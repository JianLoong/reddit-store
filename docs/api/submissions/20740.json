This ranges from OTC meds to narcotics. The type who tries giving you her prescribed tramadol if you say you have high anxiety that day and gets offended if you say no because she \"would never give you anything that would hurt you\". I've gotten in to it with her so many times because she thinks I'm ignorant for refusing to take meds if I don't need to. So, needless to say, she's had her kid heavily medicated since she was 5 (she's now 12) for her ADHD and if her kid so much as exhibits a single sign of energy, she's calling the doctor to up the dose because it's \"not working anymore\". \n\nNow, since our son started school he has been off the walls and getting in to trouble for not sitting still and disrupting class. The school pushed for an evaluation and we agreed to it no issue. But where it was so close to the end of the school year and they kept pushing it out, the evaluation was never completed. We just pushed it out of our heads at this point because it's summer and made the decision to have him evaluated a month or two prior to returning to school so next year he will be all set to go with no issues. But where it is summer, our kids have been hanging out with SILs kid a lot, since the yard is conjoined. SIL has mentioned to me several times that I need to get my son medicated because he's \"too much of a handful\" and he \"needs help\". Most of these comments are made following my son screaming through the yards while the kids are playing tag or when he randomly stops what he's doing to start dancing. He does stim a lot so he squawks and randomly starts singing made up songs but it's in no way being over the top disruptive for a mid summer afternoon and it in no way affects anyone other than my SIL. He's just playing. \n\nWell, SIL came here yesterday and said she needed to express a some \"tough love\" and basically flew off about how we weren't helping our kid because we \"refuse\" to medicate him and help him regulate his emotions. I simply got up from the table and said \"we are done here, you can leave\". She kept pushing and she wasn't listening to my husband, who kept telling her to mind her business. So I said \"just because you are a medication queen who would rather see your kid doped up rather than handle her does not mean we are those parents. Leave.\" My MIL called and said I was a \"fucking cunt\" for bashing my SIL for \"doing right by her kid and is trying her best\".", "created_utc": 1687878981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kgh8e/aita_for_calling_my_sil_a_medication_queen_and/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both you and your sister seem to have extreme views on when medication should be given, in what doses and situations. Your sister shouldn\u2019t be messing with her kids medication so much trying to make them conform perfectly to the kid she wants. You should be taking your son\u2019s signs more seriously and examining support for him more actively. You both could have expressed your opinions without devolving into personal attacks on the other.", "Info: when will your son's evaluation be complete?", "Info: if your child ends up with an ADHD diagnosis, will you medicate?", "ESH.\nIf your child is having to stim to manage their environment, you\u2019re not doing enough to help them. You should\u2019ve pushed harder and with more urgency for evaluations. Long before school age. (Note, I understand that therapies, medication, and other treatment doesn\u2019t stop stimming. But stimming is often used to reduce stress.)\n\nAnd your SIL is a major AH. There\u2019s lots of different ways to manage various conditions, medication is not always the only solution.", "ESH. Seems like you both harshly judge each other while only maintaining pleasantries for as long as it suits you aka you are in-laws.", "I assume he\u2019s getting evaluated for something like ADHD. Go over to r/ADHD and read some stories. NTA for your comment to your SIL.", "Erm ESH. Your son clearly needs intervention and she\u2019s not wrong so you massively overreacted. Also she\u2019s not wrong for medicating her kids but she should not be pushy re yours or giving you drugs.", "NTA because you are getting your son evaluated. From your description your SIL is going overboard. She should never offer prescription meds to another person for multiple reasons. She doesn't knowing if any meds she gives you have interactions. As for her daughter you don't know the full situation it sounds like the daughter is in being over medicate because a child having energy is normal. Hopefully your son's evaluation goes well. If I had been diagnosed as kid or even in high school my whole life would be be different. The meds certainly helping me and you don't seem against using medication when needed.", "SIL is an AH for pushing drugs onto you.  OP, you are an AH for not pushing to get your son evaluated immediately.  \n\nDrugs are not always the answer.  My grandson is currently under evaluation because he is showing signs of being on the spectrum or maybe even ADHD.  His therapist prefers to teach him techniques to manage himself, so he can be successful in the classroom and in the real world.  She also works with his parents so they can assist him in managing himself.\n\nThis is such a difference from 20 years ago.  My son's kindergarten teacher begged me to medicate him.  Of the 26 kids in his class, 20 were on some kind of medication.  He was partially deaf from having several ear infections as a baby and we had finally gotten speech therapy when he started school.  His teacher had him using every available assistance from the school system, and he still acted up in her class.  By 2nd grade, I admit I was starting to think I was wrong and maybe he needed medication.  I had been told he wouldn't graduate high school, would never go to college, never live on his own, etc.  \n\nHis 2nd grade teacher called me in the 1st week of school.  He asked to take my son out of all the extra assistance classes and keep him in the classroom. He felt he could be successful as long as my son knew he what he was expected to do.  To my shock, he became a model student that year.  He ended up graduating, going to college and now is a network engineer for a major hospital.  All because of that teacher.\n\nI am so glad I stood my ground and didn't medicate him.  I am so thankful my daughter and SIL are working with my grandson's therapist and taking my grandson's \"oddities\" seriously.  I am also very grateful that there are ways to manage without mind-numbing medications.\n\nOP - push hard to get your son's evaluation done sooner rather than later.  And, seriously consider what needs to be done so your son can be successful in life - not what makes your life easier.  Good luck!", "NTA. Wow. So many things wrong here. First, tramadol is a pain med, not anxiety medication. Second, though it is not actually a narcotic, it works similarly in the body and is classified as a controlled substance. She should NOT be just handing those out. Not to mention, most doctors are so strict with Tramadol scripts since they\u2019re trying to avoid a repeat of the opioid crisis I\u2019m surprised she has extras to spare if she really needs the script. \n\nThird, ADHD, if that\u2019s what your kid has, needs way more than just medication to treat. Many kids do far better with just behavioral treatments, like letting them \u201cget the crazies out\u201d (what my ADHDer called her energy release breaks) and other accommodations to help focus. As a parent of an ADHD kid, I\u2019ve met a lot of other kids with it. It\u2019s hella rare for meds alone to help. Also, rare for behavioral treatments alone, btw. It\u2019s got to be both combined. If SIL is just medicating kid, kid is never going to learn to self regulate her symptoms and is going to have issues her whole life. Let your boy be until the eval and follow his doctors\u2019 advice. \n\nAnd good luck to you with him. I hope you can find a good balance that works for him so he can be his best wildling self.", "Tramadol is not for everyone.  It's too good, and addicting.  I would probably take one right now if I had it ,and I am not in pain or anxiety. Actually, maybe a little. anybody got a Trammy ?", "ESH. You for not getting your son assessed and just waiting all summer, and her for pushing pills. You both sound like poor parents in this case.", "I mean. \n\nShe's not wrong on this one. You even had the school asking for an evaluation. And then you kept putting it off.\n\nSo yeah. ESH. Although in this particular context I think your hole is a bit larger. \n\nShe's too much of a helicopter parent and you're being the opposite and neglecting the medical needs of your kid.", ">Most of these comments are made following my son screaming through the yards while the kids are playing tag or when he randomly stops what he's doing to start dancing.\n\nGotta comment on this, what a chad.\n\nI was kind of thinking maybe you should have gotten the evaluation finished regardless of the school year finishing but if it wasn't possible it wasn't possible.\n\nYou didn't tell them how to raise their kids, they don't tell you how to raise yours. Simple as.\n\nI honestly cannot give a verdict as I am not an expert in behavioural issues with children, but I know many people with ADHD. Not all of them take meds and all of them have been pleasant people. \n\nOver prescribing medication is not good also.", "ESH The SIL may indeed be overmedicating her kids, though I assume they are prescribed by the kids doctor so the dr is involved. If not, that's time to call protective services. HOWEVER, you describe your own child as displaying stim behaviors which seems like maybe you shouldn't be so lax about getting this evaluation done and can step it up more for him. Neither of you sound great here.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a pill pusher, no doubt about it, and that's extremely unhealthy. Over time, the effectiveness of pills diminishes, which requires people to up their dose, and ultimately causes addiction. Your SIL is setting her daughter up for having a miserable life.\n\nBUT, you're not without fault in this entire situation. Kids with ADHD, ASD, and other neurospicy conditions may not be able to tolerate the situations presented in front of them, but there are methods to circumventing that kind of behaviour without the need of an assessment. Maybe it's because I worked with neurospicy kids, but I'd have your son calm in about 10 minutes.", "NTA-Medication is a good thing but no one should be blindly popping pills or giving them to children without research at the very least. You and your spouse are going about it the right way. SIL sounds like a my way or the highway asshole.", "YTA \n\nYou're literally postponing medical evaluations that could improve the quality of your child's life and education? (things don't just get pushed back for weeks, and now months, for no reason). Your sister is completely irrelevant to this conversation.", "NTA\n\nThere have been a lot of great points made.  \n\nI will just add that sharing prescription medication is illegal and can even be a felony in some circumstances.  You SIL is not only an AH, but one that could find herself in deep trouble if she is not careful.", "NTA.  Your sis & MIL are fucking AH's.  You know what's going on with your child & you are getting him evaluated.  Even if the doc gives him meds, they recommend that you only give them meds during the school year.  Most docs recommend that they take the summer off from the meds.  In the summer kids are loud & FREE!!  They are celebrating the summer.  It doesn't mean he needs meds.  It would suit your SIL if she would just let kids be kids & not try to medicate everybody.", "NTA, she just wants to medicate your kids so she doesnt feel bad about how she failed her own kid", "NTA. You have a right as a parent to take your parenting into your own hands. For me, 5 years old, is too young to be medicating behavior. Getting your son tested is a good step which you said you agreed to do. It\u2019s what you\u2019re comfortable doing, not what your SIL wants. He\u2019s not her child", "NTA...Your SIL is in no way qualified to medically assess your son.  She needs to mind her own business and hopefully your remarks will help in setting some boundaries.", "NTA. Your SIL's kid is going to have so many substance abuse problems when they grow up. If she can't handle kids being loud then she shouldn't have had kids.", "You could have said a lot worse things to her and your MIL needs to handle her own kid. Everyone has an opinion but to constantly push their opinion on you is just annoying and rude. NTA for saying what you did, good job!", "NTA.  It amazes me how many parents medicate their kids for just being kids these days.  Well guess what people, children run, play, scream, and yes stim, as part of normal childhood behavior.  One of my favorite things to do as a child was twirling around in circles until I became so dizzy I fell down.  All 3 of my siblings, and all of the neighborhood children did the same thing. None of us had ADHD, autism, or any other disorder.", "People think OTC meds cannot do harm because they are OTC but many of them can cause serious problems if you take too much. It's important to follow the directions of ANY medication and not just pop them like candy. \n\nNTA - MIL is enabling SIL's crazy. While words could have been better chosen, you're doing the right thing by having your kid evaluated and treated by professionals. Young boys have a lot of energy - maybe he's autistic, maybe not but it requires a highly trained professional to make those decisions and medicate correctly.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your SIL is a massive piece of work but, with a mother with a nasty mouth like that, it's no wonder! There's no such thing as tough love. That's a term to cover up abuse by saying you're loving someone else. SIL wasn't loving you or your son. She was forcing her opinions on you and then berating you for disagreeing. You clearly love your son and doing what needs to be done. In your own timeline. Good for you!", "I would have a huge talk with your husband about cutting his family out of y\u2019all\u2019s lives. Nobody needs that kind of negative energy. Doing this shows your child(ren) that you don\u2019t let people walk all over y\u2019all, and so he may follow that advice. I would have probably ended up blurting out the same thing at that point. You as your son\u2019s parents are allowed to choose what\u2019s right for him. You are not the asshole, your in-laws are.\n\nEdit: I guess those of you who downvoted me like to be called c***s.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I personally see no problem with my sons behavior during the summer. He can be loud, sure, and he definitely has **a lot** of energy but he's not a bad kid. He's just loud. He's never mean. He never harms others. He truly is just having fun.

Oh, right, they haven't seen a doctor yet.", "One method I've used in the past is to find out what a child's interests are, and to present activities that cater to their interests. One kid loved Pokemon, so we printed out Pokemon colouring sheets and gave them to the kid. At first the kid would just be scribbling on the paper, but eventually slowed down and started to really pay attention to the lines and using different colour crayons. Another method is to play videos that are stimulating to the senses. Search up \"dancing vegetables\" on YouTube and play it (by Hey Bear Sensory). It's 20 minutes of just veggies dancing around, and several neurospicy kids loved it.\n\nNo one should be accusing your kid of being a bad kid, because he's not. He just needs avenues to channel his sensory overloads, and vibrant colours, sounds and other sight-based feedback are known to help neurospicy kids cope with their overloads."]}
