This ranges from OTC meds to narcotics. The type who tries giving you her prescribed tramadol if you say you have high anxiety that day and gets offended if you say no because she \"would never give you anything that would hurt you\". I've gotten in to it with her so many times because she thinks I'm ignorant for refusing to take meds if I don't need to. So, needless to say, she's had her kid heavily medicated since she was 5 (she's now 12) for her ADHD and if her kid so much as exhibits a single sign of energy, she's calling the doctor to up the dose because it's \"not working anymore\". \n\nNow, since our son started school he has been off the walls and getting in to trouble for not sitting still and disrupting class. The school pushed for an evaluation and we agreed to it no issue. But where it was so close to the end of the school year and they kept pushing it out, the evaluation was never completed. We just pushed it out of our heads at this point because it's summer and made the decision to have him evaluated a month or two prior to returning to school so next year he will be all set to go with no issues. But where it is summer, our kids have been hanging out with SILs kid a lot, since the yard is conjoined. SIL has mentioned to me several times that I need to get my son medicated because he's \"too much of a handful\" and he \"needs help\". Most of these comments are made following my son screaming through the yards while the kids are playing tag or when he randomly stops what he's doing to start dancing. He does stim a lot so he squawks and randomly starts singing made up songs but it's in no way being over the top disruptive for a mid summer afternoon and it in no way affects anyone other than my SIL. He's just playing. \n\nWell, SIL came here yesterday and said she needed to express a some \"tough love\" and basically flew off about how we weren't helping our kid because we \"refuse\" to medicate him and help him regulate his emotions. I simply got up from the table and said \"we are done here, you can leave\". She kept pushing and she wasn't listening to my husband, who kept telling her to mind her business. So I said \"just because you are a medication queen who would rather see your kid doped up rather than handle her does not mean we are those parents. Leave.\" My MIL called and said I was a \"fucking cunt\" for bashing my SIL for \"doing right by her kid and is trying her best\".", "created_utc": 1687878981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kgh8e/aita_for_calling_my_sil_a_medication_queen_and/", "score": 1178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should\u2019ve pushed harder and with more urgency for evaluations. Long before school age. (Note, I understand that therapies, medication, and other treatment doesn\u2019t stop stimming. But stimming is often used to reduce stress.)\n\nAnd your SIL is a major AH. There\u2019s lots of different ways to manage various conditions, medication is not always the only solution.", "ESH. Seems like you both harshly judge each other while only maintaining pleasantries for as long as it suits you aka you are in-laws.", "I assume he\u2019s getting evaluated for something like ADHD. Go over to r/ADHD and read some stories. NTA for your comment to your SIL.", "Erm ESH. Your son clearly needs intervention and she\u2019s not wrong so you massively overreacted. Also she\u2019s not wrong for medicating her kids but she should not be pushy re yours or giving you drugs.", "NTA because you are getting your son evaluated. From your description your SIL is going overboard. She should never offer prescription meds to another person for multiple reasons. She doesn't knowing if any meds she gives you have interactions. As for her daughter you don't know the full situation it sounds like the daughter is in being over medicate because a child having energy is normal. Hopefully your son's evaluation goes well. If I had been diagnosed as kid or even in high school my whole life would be be different. The meds certainly helping me and you don't seem against using medication when needed.", "SIL is an AH for pushing drugs onto you.  OP, you are an AH for not pushing to get your son evaluated immediately.  \n\nDrugs are not always the answer.  My grandson is currently under evaluation because he is showing signs of being on the spectrum or maybe even ADHD.  His therapist prefers to teach him techniques to manage himself, so he can be successful in the classroom and in the real world.  She also works with his parents so they can assist him in managing himself.\n\nThis is such a difference from 20 years ago.  My son's kindergarten teacher begged me to medicate him.  Of the 26 kids in his class, 20 were on some kind of medication.  He was partially deaf from having several ear infections as a baby and we had finally gotten speech therapy when he started school.  His teacher had him using every available assistance from the school system, and he still acted up in her class.  By 2nd grade, I admit I was starting to think I was wrong and maybe he needed medication.  I had been told he wouldn't graduate high school, would never go to college, never live on his own, etc.  \n\nHis 2nd grade teacher called me in the 1st week of school.  He asked to take my son out of all the extra assistance classes and keep him in the classroom. He felt he could be successful as long as my son knew he what he was expected to do.  To my shock, he became a model student that year.  He ended up graduating, going to college and now is a network engineer for a major hospital.  All because of that teacher.\n\nI am so glad I stood my ground and didn't medicate him.  I am so thankful my daughter and SIL are working with my grandson's therapist and taking my grandson's \"oddities\" seriously.  I am also very grateful that there are ways to manage without mind-numbing medications.\n\nOP - push hard to get your son's evaluation done sooner rather than later.  And, seriously consider what needs to be done so your son can be successful in life - not what makes your life easier.  Good luck!", "NTA. Wow. So many things wrong here. First, tramadol is a pain med, not anxiety medication. Second, though it is not actually a narcotic, it works similarly in the body and is classified as a controlled substance. She should NOT be just handing those out. Not to mention, most doctors are so strict with Tramadol scripts since they\u2019re trying to avoid a repeat of the opioid crisis I\u2019m surprised she has extras to spare if she really needs the script. \n\nThird, ADHD, if that\u2019s what your kid has, needs way more than just medication to treat. Many kids do far better with just behavioral treatments, like letting them \u201cget the crazies out\u201d (what my ADHDer called her energy release breaks) and other accommodations to help focus. As a parent of an ADHD kid, I\u2019ve met a lot of other kids with it. It\u2019s hella rare for meds alone to help. Also, rare for behavioral treatments alone, btw. It\u2019s got to be both combined. If SIL is just medicating kid, kid is never going to learn to self regulate her symptoms and is going to have issues her whole life. Let your boy be until the eval and follow his doctors\u2019 advice. \n\nAnd good luck to you with him. I hope you can find a good balance that works for him so he can be his best wildling self.", "Tramadol is not for everyone.  It's too good, and addicting.  I would probably take one right now if I had it ,and I am not in pain or anxiety. Actually, maybe a little. anybody got a Trammy ?", "ESH. You for not getting your son assessed and just waiting all summer, and her for pushing pills. You both sound like poor parents in this case.", "I mean. \n\nShe's not wrong on this one. You even had the school asking for an evaluation. And then you kept putting it off.\n\nSo yeah. ESH. Although in this particular context I think your hole is a bit larger. \n\nShe's too much of a helicopter parent and you're being the opposite and neglecting the medical needs of your kid.", ">Most of these comments are made following my son screaming through the yards while the kids are playing tag or when he randomly stops what he's doing to start dancing.\n\nGotta comment on this, what a chad.\n\nI was kind of thinking maybe you should have gotten the evaluation finished regardless of the school year finishing but if it wasn't possible it wasn't possible.\n\nYou didn't tell them how to raise their kids, they don't tell you how to raise yours. Simple as.\n\nI honestly cannot give a verdict as I am not an expert in behavioural issues with children, but I know many people with ADHD. Not all of them take meds and all of them have been pleasant people. \n\nOver prescribing medication is not good also.", "ESH The SIL may indeed be overmedicating her kids, though I assume they are prescribed by the kids doctor so the dr is involved. If not, that's time to call protective services. HOWEVER, you describe your own child as displaying stim behaviors which seems like maybe you shouldn't be so lax about getting this evaluation done and can step it up more for him. Neither of you sound great here.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a pill pusher, no doubt about it, and that's extremely unhealthy. Over time, the effectiveness of pills diminishes, which requires people to up their dose, and ultimately causes addiction. Your SIL is setting her daughter up for having a miserable life.\n\nBUT, you're not without fault in this entire situation. Kids with ADHD, ASD, and other neurospicy conditions may not be able to tolerate the situations presented in front of them, but there are methods to circumventing that kind of behaviour without the need of an assessment. Maybe it's because I worked with neurospicy kids, but I'd have your son calm in about 10 minutes.", "NTA-Medication is a good thing but no one should be blindly popping pills or giving them to children without research at the very least. You and your spouse are going about it the right way. SIL sounds like a my way or the highway asshole.", "YTA \n\nYou're literally postponing medical evaluations that could improve the quality of your child's life and education?

Your sister is completely irrelevant to this conversation.", "NTA\n\nThere have been a lot of great points made.  \n\nI will just add that sharing prescription medication is illegal and can even be a felony in some circumstances.  You SIL is not only an AH, but one that could find herself in deep trouble if she is not careful.", "NTA.  Your sis & MIL are fucking AH's.  You know what's going on with your child & you are getting him evaluated.  Even if the doc gives him meds, they recommend that you only give them meds during the school year.  Most docs recommend that they take the summer off from the meds.  In the summer kids are loud & FREE!!  They are celebrating the summer.  It doesn't mean he needs meds.  It would suit your SIL if she would just let kids be kids & not try to medicate everybody.", "NTA, she just wants to medicate your kids so she doesnt feel bad about how she failed her own kid", "NTA. You have a right as a parent to take your parenting into your own hands. For me, 5 years old, is too young to be medicating behavior.

If she can't handle kids being loud then she shouldn't have had kids.", "You could have said a lot worse things to her and your MIL needs to handle her own kid. Everyone has an opinion but to constantly push their opinion on you is just annoying and rude. NTA for saying what you did, good job!", "NTA.  It amazes me how many parents medicate their kids for just being kids these days.  Well guess what people, children run, play, scream, and yes stim, as part of normal childhood behavior.  One of my favorite things to do as a child was twirling around in circles until I became so dizzy I fell down.  All 3 of my siblings, and all of the neighborhood children did the same thing. None of us had ADHD, autism, or any other disorder.", "People think OTC meds cannot do harm because they are OTC but many of them can cause serious problems if you take too much. It's important to follow the directions of ANY medication and not just pop them like candy. \n\nNTA - MIL is enabling SIL's crazy. While words could have been better chosen, you're doing the right thing by having your kid evaluated and treated by professionals. Young boys have a lot of energy - maybe he's autistic, maybe not but it requires a highly trained professional to make those decisions and medicate correctly.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your SIL is a massive piece of work but, with a mother with a nasty mouth like that, it's no wonder! There's no such thing as tough love. That's a term to cover up abuse by saying you're loving someone else. SIL wasn't loving you or your son. She was forcing her opinions on you and then berating you for disagreeing.

One kid loved Pokemon, so we printed out Pokemon colouring sheets and gave them to the kid. At first the kid would just be scribbling on the paper, but eventually slowed down and started to really pay attention to the lines and using different colour crayons. Another method is to play videos that are stimulating to the senses. Search up \"dancing vegetables\" on YouTube and play it (by Hey Bear Sensory).

You can\u2019t even reliably compare boys and girls\u2019 behavior even if they are exactly the same age. Boys typically need more physical activity and can be louder and more energetic and unpredictable when compared with girls, and they tend to develop things like communication and self-Regulation later than horns. Behavior that is a big red flag for a slightly older girl may only be mildly atypical for a younger boy. That being said, your SIL may be legitimately seeing telltale signs that are pretty universal regardless of gender, and may indicate a need for intervention. Do not discount that perspective bc she is conditioned to notice things by her experience and access to parental education from her daughter\u2019s care providers in a way that you are not. My son has autism, developmental delays, had behavioral problems and has attention/focus issues. He\u2019s 12 now, and I have 2 other sons, one who we suspected had a developmental delay, and both of them exhibited problems with attention and focus that had me expressing concerns with his teachers and pediatrician.

I have struggled most of my adult life bc only a few years ago did I know I needed help. Don\u2019t downplay your child\u2019s need for evaluation and intervention or your need for support and parental education.

You don\u2019t even have to go the meds route, but your kid is showing signs that he may need additional support, and you keep pushing it off. There\u2019s tons of ways to manage ADHD, but most should have professional input from therapists to psychiatrists. \n\nI hope you know that your child having ADHD or needing additional help (even in the form of meds) isn\u2019t a reflection on your parenting. You can be a good parent and have a child with ADHD, it shouldn\u2019t be a badge of shame. Needing medication shouldn\u2019t be a badge of shame either. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to keep giving the kids higher dosages so they stay calm, and I think children should have a space to be rambunctious and explore and live their lives. However, there should also be an understanding of what behavior is appropriate for what environment.\n\nESH.", "As someone who wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until college, your kid needs that evaluation, OP. If he's stimming and not able to focus on things he needs help. I was more on the side of daydreaming and not able to handle a lot of noise without getting overstimulated, and that was bad enough!\n\nAnd your sister could get into a lot of trouble for sharing prescription drugs. Tramadol is controlled now, and has been for about a decade I believe. I'm sure on the controlled part, just not how long. It wasn't when I was younger, then I didn't have health insurance but when I did again it was. Also it sounds like she could be over medicating her child. But what she's doing shouldn't affect how you raise your kid. \n\nLastly, if your child is diagnosed you can get help with giving them coping skills. It doesn't mean drug them until they can't function or lose their personality. It means help them cope with a world that doesn't cater to the way their brain works.", "Agreed. Even if OP wants to take a different approach to medication it still doesn't excuse blowing off recommended evaluations just so that they can put off supporting him until the very last possible moment. Summer is one of the best times for working out what works and what doesn't with medication (if they choose to go that route), coping mechanisms, etc. Even if they decide not to medicate they should at least understand what they're choosing not to medicate FOR, and the risks/benefits of both.", "i agree this 100% ESH", "i came here to say this too. as a licensed therapist (not able to prescribe meds) parents on both ends of the spectrum suck to deal with.", "I can't agree with this more my son exhibits those same tendencies and he also has can't take 90% of the medication available for ADHD because he exhibits the bad side effects it took years to figure that out and months of insomnia and self harming in-between each medication.", "I don\u2019t trust OPs explanation of their sister at all.

Similarly to how benzodiazepines can work as a rescue med for panic attacks, the calming effect of tramadol can reduce anxiety symptoms.", "\n> Third, ADHD, if that\u2019s what your kid has, needs way more than just medication to treat. Many kids do far better with just behavioral treatments, like letting them \u201cget the crazies out\u201d (what my ADHDer called her energy release breaks) and other accommodations to help focus. As a parent of an ADHD kid, I\u2019ve met a lot of other kids with it. It\u2019s hella rare for meds alone to help. Also, rare for behavioral treatments alone, btw. It\u2019s got to be both combined. If SIL is just medicating kid, kid is never going to learn to self regulate her symptoms and is going to have issues her whole life. Let your boy be until the eval and follow his doctors\u2019 advice.\n\nSeconding this, as someone who has been medicated since they were a kid I can tell you 1. When I was a kid I fucking hated my medication and the way it made me feel ( and yes I tried more than 1 kind of ADD medication) 2. Being on this medication is exhausting and I need frequent breaks even as an adult 3. The side effects and impact on mood/happiness (not just while on the drug but when it wears off) can be pretty overwhelming \n\nI would always default first to non-amphetamine solutions first, behavioral therapy, alternative and more engaging methods of learning, etc. if medication is still needed after this, then at least you know you actually need the medication and the juice really is worth the squeeze. But parents who immediately stick their kids on amphetamines thinking it\u2019s an easy solution make me facepalm, the method with the most drawbacks shouldn\u2019t be the first thing you turn to, nor is it even going to work on its own without behavioral methods to supplement it.", "Exactly what I was thinking. I know a lot of people with ADHD and though I understand the ADHDers in the comments have had good experiences with medication, that's simply not the answer for everyone.\n\nAll my siblings and I had some similar behavioral traits to OP's LO, and we ended up all different diagnoses. Outside factors held us back from these diagnoses--our schools didn't help at all, sometimes evals take time and that's no one's fault--so we were all older when diagnosed and all contributed to decisions over medicating ourselves. One of us chose meds, one of us got on one medication but keeps a low dose and relies more on other things to help, and one of us opted for no meds whatsoever and has found other ways to manage. All are perfectly fine choices and we are all doing well. We should not push anybody to go on medication or put their children on medication when we aren't there to understand the environment, available alternatives, possible effects or clashes in medication, etc.", "To be fair, it sounds like they mean starting kindergarten. Most teachers will take a wait and see approach for the first bit because some children in kindergarten have never been away from their parents all day, and anxiety can mimic some symptoms of ADHD (and vice versa ime).

Someone having a good career as an adult doesn't inherently mean their treatment plan as a kid was the best one for them. Sometimes we succeed despite how our parents handled things, not because of it.", "I got diagnosed late because of my parents\u2019 fear of ADHD medication, and while I appreciate your worries about medication as well as your early diagnosis of your son, I want to correct the misconception about medication.

This is a HUGE problem for people with ADHD.

When I took Adderall I would frequently split my pills into halves or even quarters because I found it to be too much. Same could probably be done for saffron supplements- however, it does appear that it may be difficult to get actual saffron.\n\nRosemary and lavender I grow myself. :) I've only started this recently, however, so I can't really report anything on it unfortunately. Rosemary of course has plenty of other benefits elsewhere so I'd recommend growing it regardless.", "What other way is there other than the prescribed way?", "Preach.

Downplaying your child's need for support doesn't do anyone any favours, especially not the child.", "The brain is very plastic until around 26 years of age. In the 80s, many kids were getting diagnosed who did not actually have ADHD and put on medication that harmed them. \n\nSure, assess the kid, but there are many reasons a kid may have unusual behaviour patterns, and professionals often don\u2019t rule those out before prescribing meds. If the kid is on summer vacation and not hurting anyone, there should be no rush to medicate.\n\nI have ADHD, and my partner was also diagnosed with ADHD as a child. He displayed symptoms OP mentions, and I did not display any of them. He does not take drugs and has never taken drugs, and as and adult he is super organized, had little trouble focusing or getting tasks done, and is excellent at planning. I, on the other hand, struggle with all of these to this day\u2014even with medication. \n\nExcept in the most extreme cases, parenting makes the most difference. For some, meds will work, for others it will nuke their creativity and zest for life. I do not think \u201cthe sooner the better\u201d is good advice when it comes to medicating a kid for non-destructive behaviours. If they become self-destructive in school, then look at solutions. Medication is only one option, and it often only works in tandem with other behavioural supports. \n\nOP\u2019s SIL sounds like someone who doesn\u2019t want to do the work of parenting and that\u2019s why her kid is medicated.

They're not medical professionals. When I was diagnosed with adhd it was because my parents took it upon themselves to take me to a doctor for an evaluation.

When I took my ADHD meds, I wasn't just not hungry: the sight and smell of food actively made me nauseous. I'd go 8.5 hrs every school day having only eaten breakfast and a granola bar or ice cream sandwich for lunch. They also gave me horrendous burnout when they wore off, so I'd be in a nasty mood, pass tf out immediately after school for 2-3 hours, and then wake up feeling fine. When I was a teen I didn't need the meds to function outside of school, so my therapist and psychiatrist suggested that I simply not take them on weekends or breaks. \n\nHOWEVER, as I said, this was carefully considered and regulated *by licensed professionals* who knew  me, my disorder, my medication, and my reactions/side effects to that medication personally. This wasn't something my parents or I had just arbitrarily decided on our own, and imo that's the key here. I was also receiving professional support for my disorder *outside* of just medication, so I was actively being taught how to recognize, take responsibility for, and cope with my own behavioral issues and symptoms. \n\nMy point being that far too many people believe that adequate treatment of ADHD starts and ends with medication. It doesn't.

Even some of the innocuous ones like hand flapping or rocking are considered \u201cdistracting.\u201d Vocal stims, similar to how OP described, are not uncommon.

I was a classroom management case whose doctor believed I would \"grow out of it\".  After 5th grade I was offered no further support.

I was just 'lazy' at that point.", ">Also: doctors who suggest a \u201cmedication vacation\u201d are also doing a disservice. For one, a lot of drugs that work on the brain just don\u2019t work as well after a hiatus. \n\nI agree with most of your comment (especially that ADHD isn't only worth treating for the classroom) but when it comes to Adderall this isn't the case. It's not like a lot of drugs for mental health. It doesn't have to build up in the body over time. You pop it and it works. You don't HAVE to take it at perfect intervals, you can take it if you feel like you're going to need it. Lots of people take it every day, but many people only take it during the week and then have a break over the weekend, or only take it for specific tasks that they can't focus on by themselves. \n\nTaking a break from the medication can help you keep your doses low so you don't build a high tolerance. It works for some people just fine. Again, this is strictly speaking about Adderall.\n\nAll that being said, OP definitely shouldn't wait for the next school year to get the evaluation.", "Yep, I was diagnosed with ADHD at 35.

Work shouldn't be the only place that benefits from you having full use/control of your brain and your limited ability to function.\n\nYou have chores and projects and errands and fun stuff to do when you're not at work too, and if your executive dysfunction prevents you from doing them, you're the one who loses out.\n\nIt's like, part of my brain is locked behind a paywall. Why would I pay the price (for the doctors and prescription) and then only use it to make money for other people?

There is no telling how your life would be different. My life would have been different if I **wasn't** on it because simulants has caused permanent heart problems for me.

So they could have a kid with ADHD, or autism, or even poor eyesight and think \"there's nothing wrong, that's just how my kid is.\" \n\nIt's one of the reasons I believe in public school vs. homeschooling. Being in the school system means better access to people who are trained to notice those differences and let you know when it's time to have an evaluation. \n\nAlso I think if you go through the school, those evaluations are free and provided by the district.

Op mentioned that they pushed the thought out of their head because it was summer, evaluations take a while but pushing the thought out of your head doesn\u2019t make it go quicker, and honestly just shows a lack of caring for her son and his possible struggles", "Agreed on the frame of reference for normal (for ND), though eyesight should be really apparent unless it\u2019s just lightly fuzzy.\n\nSpeaking as someone who didn\u2019t get diagnosed with ADHD until 23, sometimes it really is a matter of having no frame of reference. My dad is undiagnosed ADHD, my sister is unofficially diagnosed, and it turned out that all of the shared personality traits we just thought we inherited from my dad were all ADHD. My dad likely didn\u2019t get diagnosed because his older sister has it but hers was much more apparent, so by comparison, my dad seemed \u2018normal.\u2019\n\nMedication has been a godsend though, holy shit.", "It's easier for them to let it get so bad that a teacher finally stepped in you mean. Schools are stretched very thin in most places. If it's bad enough the school is stepping in it's usually full on neglect. Especially for something like poor eyesight. \n\nIf you pay attention to your child at all you'll notice squinting, moving closer to observe things, failure to immediately notice as you approach ECT. Same with lack of hearing too. Neurodivergences are a bit more difficult....but if you're regularly checking in and doing parenting research or hanging out with any other kids and parents it tends to start being very obvious that your kid might be a bit different.", "OP does not sound like a reliable narrator.", "Yes, exactly. This is the internet.", "Ugh i feel this with my whole heart. Also- the beautiful thing about ADHD meds are you actually DON'T have to take them every day-- so OP can just let her son be a wild, hyper kid on the weekends, summers, etc. and just give him what he needs for school and certain playdates.", "Thank you <3 you as well", "Right-- I'm not saying that it never happens or is never necessary. I'm saying that, in the context of everything else OP has described regarding their SIL, it's not really an encouraging sign of SIL's overall approach to her parenting style or her daughter's disorder. \n\nMy point is that all we have to go off of is OP's description. Whether that description is reliable or comprehensive or not, it's still all that we have to judge off of. And by that description, SIL is, at the very least, treading a fine line of medicating her daughter for her own convience as a parent as opposed to her daughter's actual overall health and need for that level of medication.", "Exactly. In addition, most doctors are relatively strict with prescribing ADHD medications (usually stimulants), especially to children, since higher doses greatly increase the risk of adverse effects. There is little chance that the doctor doesn\u2019t assess and monitor the child\u2019s current condition before increasing the dosage of their medication.", "I can't take credit for it, I yoinked it from someone else on reddit lol", "She\u2019s going to need a Princess Spice crown. \ud83d\udc51", "Omg. Please give me all your ondensetron. lol And yeah, I\u2019ve offered my tramacet to family members when they have a migraine or something. Like\u2026 it\u2019s not that big a deal. \n\nOP seems similar to my ex, whom I actually had to TAKE TO COURT to even get her to agree to get an ADHD/ODD assessment for them. And it didn\u2019t even happen until grade 7, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to push just as hard about the medication and I\u2019ll have to take her to court AGAIN. Thing is that ODD can be avoided entirely if they\u2019re medicated already by this age. So that\u2019s a big piss-off.", "\"It's my job as a diligent parent to be a keen observer of my child. And if something seems challenging for her, I need to support her and get her the tools she needs so she can manage her possible spice and be happy. My parents didn't notice my learning disability, I wasn't diagnosed until my mid-30s, I want better for my kid.\"\n\nFuck yeah, mama (or other gendered parental term of choice)! You're doing exactly what a good parent should, and your kid will have a better life because of it.", "Balance? What\u2019s that? \ud83e\uddd0", "I swear, so many people hop on here with their asinine opinions yet we can tell they severely lack reading comprehension when they spout off nonsense like this....", "Different doesn't equal neurodivergent. \n\nAnd yes, schools are stretched thin. But that's not because parents are neglectful, it's because our government refuses to fund them. \n\nAnd I'm sorry but parents are busy. They have to raise their kids, go to work, maintain a house, maintain their relationships, and a bunch of other shit just to get through the day. Not all of them have the time or energy to do research on the side. \n\nAnd by the way, stepping in is what teachers do. It's part of the job. An important one in fact. \n\nAs long as you're taking the teacher's recommendations seriously, which the OP is, then you're doing fine in my book.", "I literally hide bottles of ondanestron in people's bags as they leave my house lmao.\n\nUgh I'm sorry about your ex. My husband can be foot-draggy about things, either because of denial or because he's not very observant (like, dude, do you not see how all the other kids sat and watched the cute little puppet show while our kid faffed about and rolled on the floor?). But I just make the appointments and he gets with the program. I don't have to take him to court.", "haha considering I am manically cycling through reddit twitter and my work responsibilities, in an effort to self soothe through chasing the dopamine... your guess is as good as mine. :P", "Ikr, it boggles my mind", "What is the literal definition of divergent?\n\nAnd parents still need to parent. \n\nAnd stepping in is the job of the teacher. But if they're stepping in for something medical that the parents didn't even notice then the parents also failed. And parents are going to fail. But shitting on someone else instead of recognizing that is where OP really went wrong. \n\nAnd I say this as someone with multiple divergencies.\n\nBut either way I appreciate the discourse and wish you a lovely afternoon as I won't be continuing this conversation further."]}
