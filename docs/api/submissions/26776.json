And you're the one complaining that she isn't back at 100% after two weeks?\n\nBut even let's say you're right (you're not) and your wife is being unreasonable complaining about her pain a massive 2 weeks after giving birth, insulting her and hanging up on her was absolutely an asshole way of handling this.\n\nMaybe she's depressed (please look up PPD it's very serious), maybe she's feeling lonely, maybe she's overwhelmed and scared.

Get her to her dr ASAP. And make sure you\u2019re doing EVERYTHING for her. \n\nGiving birth is like the most intense workout ever times 100.

And because you are clueless obviously, I will try to spell out why:\n\n1. \"this situation continued for a full two weeks\" - it can take months to get rid of all the physical consequences of a pregnancy and a delivery, some might take years, some changes can stay for life. This includes hormonal imbalances, tears, sutures, and what not. \n2. Many women experience post-natal depression that can get very serious and life-treatening in some cases. Having a supporting partner is not always prevention but it definitely can help if that is the case.\n3. She is staying at home and carrying for YOUR baby the entire day, while also recovering from this physically and psychologically traumatic event. When will you start handing your responsibility for the situation? \n4. Partner communication is important for every relationship. You basically told your wife \"Don't complain to me\" and what the result of this will be - she does not want to communicate with you anymore. Where is the surprise? You wanna hear only the good things, let her carry the bad things on her own? What sort of partner are you then? What sort of emotional support are you providing?", "YTA. A cold, rude, insensitive asshole. \n\n\"Full two weeks\" ... seriously?... be prepared...   it will take a lot longer still. Support her!", "YTA. Big time.\n\n*What newborn actually whines, though? This makes no sense to me.* Your wife's symptoms aren't trivial. Pain is the body's way of announcing something is wrong. Trivial? Are you kidding. Giving birth is no walk in the park? Its the hardest and most dangerous work most human bodies ever endure. And headache and abdominal pain can indicate the body isn't responding to recovery. Her emotional well being also seems indicative of a medical problem, with post partem depression being but one potential problem that can arise.\n\nYour wife needs to be encouraged to seek out her medical team for answers. She isn't whining. She's suffering.", "YTA and I would not have been there when you got home. These are common postpartum symptoms and she was looking to you for support. \n\nYou\u2019re a lot worse then just an AH", "YTA. Have you ever heard of PPD? Your job as her husband is to care for her and support her. She just went through the most life changing 9 months of her life, and when she is down you choose to make her feel worse instead of trying to support her? This is a transition for both of you, but you need to act together and not against one another. Do better OP.", "YTA.\n\nI'm not even going to bother to explain why, if you are unable to figure it out yourself.", "YTA your wife just gave birth TWO WEEKS AGO, you're already back at work trying to ignore her, and she's on her own, in physical pain, and caring for a newborn.  JFC man.", "YTA. Your wife isn\u2019t being whiny. She\u2019s going through one of the most difficult things a woman goes through physically, mentally, emotionally, and hormonally.

Regardless, I was looking for an easy one this morning and sir, you did not disappoint.\n\nWhat are you like when you're sick?  Are you a big strong dude?  Or are you whiney as hell and incapable of doing anything?  I'm just curious because if you ever want to have her care for you in the future when you're sick or do ANYTHING for you at all, you'll call her and apologize. You'll also thank her for putting up with you and having your child in the first place.  Post-partum depression is a real thing and your wife is calling out to you for help.  Instead of reassuring her, you're validating her fears.  This is what leads people in bad places to act on their feelings and off themselves and sometimes their kids. \n\nALL she's asking you to do is buy her chocolates on the way home.  Are you telling her that you're so busy that you can't manage that?  Or is it that you're too incompetent?  She just pushed a baby out of her body two weeks ago and is managing YOUR household by herself while you're at work.  There are new skills that she's had to learn, new challenges every single damn day that show themselves, and meanwhile you went back to work like it was nothing.  Oh no, you had a task to do at work?  Definitely sounds more important than your wife's mental health.\n\nAnd I know you're going to say that you love her and that yes, she's important to her (maybe you'll say this?).  But if that's true, then you wouldn't have posted here in the first place.\n\nHer symptoms are nothing \"trivial.\"  For 9 months she grew a damn baby.  What the fuck did you do during that time?\n\nGet her a sitter for a day so she can go to her doctor and talk to them about getting some mental help.  Post-partum depression is serious as fuck.\n\nOtherwise, I hope you get the divorce you deserve.\n\nAnd also: \n\n>even our newborn isn\u2019t as whiner as her \n\nDo you resent your newborn for being whiny?\n\nEDIT to add my judgment and to ask an additional question.", "YTA the woman you supposedly love pushed that blessing of yours out of her body only 14 days ago.", "Yta\n\n\nYou do realize she could be suffering from postpartum?\n\n\nOr a less severe case of just adjusting after giving birth.\n\n\nYou sound uncaring and dismissive.", "YTA\n\nEducate yourself on what a woman's body goes through for 9 months GROWING A LITTLE HUMAN, then giving birth to a HUMAN, the hormonal system and the actual healing of HER BODY!!!!\n\nAs a husband you're not supporting her.\nAs a father... who knows.\n\nDo better\n\nApologize for your words & for your ignorance.", "She likely has post partum depression!!

I had a spinal anaesthetic with my other babies. The pain relief wasn't even close to the epidural. It was not at all pleasant, but on the bright side... no itching...so yay?\ud83d\ude10"]}
