We were both very confused emotionally, and what we had was very unhealthy. We were both physically attracted to each other, but he said all he wanted out of our relationship was something casual. I reluctantly agreed, and our relationship went on for several months. After a while I kind of snapped back to reality and saw how toxic what we had was. I have nothing against FWB relationships, but what we had wasn't healthy and wasn't a good coping mechanism, so I told him we need to go out separate ways and he said okay. I haven't talked to him since.\n\nNow we're in the present. Since then, I took a break from dating for a until I met my now boyfriend. We're both very happy.\nI have a best friend, we'll call her Jamie. We've been friends since sophomore year of highschool. Jamie and I are the kind of friends that we can spend weeks or even months apart, but get together and catch up right where we left off previously. I appreciate her friendship more than anything.\nWe had a little date with her recently, and she told me she's been \"talking\" to someone, and she pulls up a picture.\n\nI think you know where this is going... It was Mark. I never told Jamie the details about Mark and I's \"relationship\" and the fighting and toxicity it had, I was really embarrassed during that period of time. She just knew I was \"seeing\" him.\n\nAnyways, I was speechless. My knee jerk reaction was to just leave. I talked to her briefly later that I was in shock and I just had to go and process this.\n\nSince then, she's been asking me a lot to go on double dates and do stuff with the two of them, which is something we did with our highschool sweethearts and both really enjoyed, but I always decline.\n\nIdk what mark has told her, but she's telling me it's time to move on. She says we need to make amends and find a common ground so she can be happy, but I told her idk if I could ever do that. We've mutually stopped texting each other less, and idk if I should apologize and try to make amends with Mark to save what I have with Jamie.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit for clarification:\n\n-Mark would emotionally manipulate me or verbally abuse/harass me if I didn't do the \"benefits\" part. That was the toxic part of our relationship. Idk if that was just his personality or part of the fact that we were at our lowest, that's partially why I'm on the fence of hearing him and Jamie out.\n\n-I didn't just leave Jamie out on our date. She told me about 15-20 minutes in to our conversation, I tried to continue to converse with her, but I couldn't. I wrapped up what we were talking about and told her I had to go after about 30 minutes.\n\nEdit 2: TY for all the helpful and diverse takes on my dilemma. It's really helped me process what I want to do. This is what I plan to do later:\n\n- I'm going to facetime Jamie (how we like to talk when we don't do dates), tell her about my experience with Mark in detail, tell her how I feel, but also have her explain her experience in detail and how SHE feels. This isn't just about me, it's about her, too. That's part of the reason I feel so overwhelmed.\n\n- if and when I feel comfortable, I will accept a double date. Not only will I have Jamie there, but I'll also have my boyfriend. I need to focus less on Mark being there and more on the two of them being there, as well.", "created_utc": 1682530956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zrifq/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_after_seeing_who_her/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one sucks in this scenario.", "info: Are you saying that you just left whatever venue y'all were at, mid-conversation, because you realized she was dating your ex-FWB? Like, did you at least say bye or something?", "Curious as to why your friend knew you were seeing Mark at one point in time and now she\u2019s not only telling you she\u2019s been talking to someone, but is also enthusiastically suggesting you all hangout together. \n\nI don\u2019t mean that in like a dumb girl code ownership over people way, but when she started talking to him I imagine she\u2019d text and mention it versus doing a weird reveal. \n\nSecondly, this guy emotionally abused you as a means to coerce you into sex and then continued to abuse you when you didn\u2019t want to. Why are we focusing on making your friend happy instead of, oh idk warning her about this dude? Why would you want your best friend to fall victim to the same things you did? I highly doubt Mark has transformed into a saintly gentleman in the last three years. \n\nHave an honestly conversation with your best friend and tell her about your experience with this guy.

No drama. \n\nThat's what happens in FWB situations, they aren't long term and they are supposed to end at some point. \n\nYou guys never made a comment to each other, it just wasn't a good thing for you. So why is it so difficult for you to accept socializing with a past FWB?", "NTA, it\u2019s a weird expectation on her part that you\u2019d be going on double dates with this guy. One thing to say she\u2019s enjoying your sloppy seconds but another to want you to enjoy them with her \ud83e\udd2e", "op=NTA\n\nBasically, Mark used abuse to pressure you(force you?) into continuing a sexual relationship.  Depending on how things went down, this could be defined as sexual assault.  \n\nI can see why you don't want to be anywhere near this guy.  You know that Mark is good at manipulation--why would you allow him to try to manipulate you again?\n\nI think you should write out your experience with him.  Go over it a couple times(try to make it factual not emotion/inflammatory) and then present it to her to read.  Tell her that you cannot/will not be comfortable around him.  That as much as you treasure your friendship with her, your mental health MUST take priority.  \n\nYou will gladly continue your friendship with her, but physically you refuse to spend time around Mark.  Do not Let him near you.  Your safety takes priority.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's no one's fault. Your friend had no context on the details of your relationship with Mark. And she's being honest about dating him.   \nAlso, kinda weird of her to expect to go on double dates with you. Lol.", "Ultimately, NTA.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t try to force this situation on you.

Because if this is what makes Jamie happy, I'm not going to stop her. Her and her happiness mean everything to me. But like I said, it's going to take a lot to make amends with this guy.", "This. Nah", "Yeah I wrapped up the conversation and told her I have to go. I wouldn't *actually* just get up and run away.\nWe usually go out for 2-3 hours but I left after 30 minutes.", "Also she showed me a picture of both of them with a silly Snapchat filter. It wasn't just like a weird reveal or something XD", "I really glossed over their relationship bc I don't know TOO much but this is what I do know.\n\nIt's basically been the polar opposite of my experience with him. He treats her very well, takes her out on public dates often, they waited a little while to be physically intimate, etc.\n\nIt shows a lot of green flags of character development for me. That's why I've been hesitant to mention my past experiences with him, because we were both emotionally broken, and at a low point in our lives. That's why I've been debating accepting a double date, so I can 1.) See their interactions and hear this dude out and 2.) Have *my* boyfriend present in case anything happens that I'm uncomfortable with.", "We'd be really mellow and happy for a while, and then he'd be really manipulative and and verbally abusive if I didn't want to meet up for... Ya know.\n\nHe'd also ghost me/block me if I did something he didn't like, he wouldn't really communicate with me. But I guess sometimes I wouldn't communicate either out of fear and doubt.\n\nLike I said, we were both really emotionally confused and broken. If he's changed and is better, I'd honestly be willing to hear the dude out. It's just hard to move on past the image you have in your mind of someone, ya know?", "And OP's current bf is dating the \"sloppy seconds\" of Mark. \ud83d\ude44\n\nYou and those who also go by this idea of (non-porn) \"sloppy seconds\" share the same basic thinking as those who demand that their partner be a virgin/have never been with anyone else before. The more sexual partners in a person's past the ickier/tainted that person is in your minds.", "Like I said, we used to do it all the time. It was the majority of the dates we would go on. So I think she wants that again.", "This is such a weird take! OP says she didn't give her friend the details at the time, and if one of my closest friends is hooking up with somebody but not telling me anything about it then I assume *they're* not that serious about the FWB. I'd def not think it was an issue if I started seeing them years later, and I can totally see waiting till we meet up in person to tell them. Obviously the friend should drop the double date thing after OP says no, but it *still* sounds like she's not telling her friend why she doesn't want to hang with Mark", "It sounds like they just started seeing each other so he could just be waving face. If you warn her and he doesn\u2019t seem to be the same great, but if he does then what? There\u2019s no harm in saying \u201chey I\u2019m not saying I know Mark now but when I was seeing him\u2026\u201d", "Ok, so it sounds like you were thinking FWB he was thinking, \"booty call.\" \n\nBoth of you were unable to communicate appropriately. \n\nDid he stalk or otherwise harass you after you broke it off with him? \n\nHave you changed and grown? Why do you doubt he has? \n\nIf your friendship is important to you, and you are emotionally capable of seeing him, then maybe you could try a double date. That way you have support for yourself and you can see how they interact. That's the only way you are going to know if he has changed. \n\nYou are also entitled to make this a hard boundary for you and continue to distance yourself from your friend. \n\nOnly you know how this has the possibility to affect you.", "I agree, I don't really like the term 'sloppy seconds'.\n\nThat's why I've kind of been shying away from comments that use the whole \"girl code\" logic.\n\nIf she and Mark have a connection that we weren't able to, that's literally nobody's fault. And I'm not going to tell her she can't like/love somebody because I've dated/been intimate with them, that's selfish.", "Yes, I agree to an extent. But her friend should not be forcing it on her or telling her it is \u2018time to move on.\u2019 That\u2019s what pushes her friend to AH status for me.\n\nEdit: also her friend saying that OP should make amends so that the friend can be happy is frankly rude and not something I would appreciate my friend saying to me. She doesn\u2019t know Mark and OPs entire history together, she\u2019s not entitled to it (if she is, how is it okay that she kept her new relationship from OP?) and she 100% should be giving OP space because she kind of sprang something on her.", "No, he didn't harass me or stalk me afterwards, at least not to my knowledge (I blocked him on SM to move on from the experience)\n\nAnd I don't doubt he's grown. I feel I've grown from both that experience and just life over the past few years. Again, that's why I'm on the fence of going on a date and hearing the whole situation and their relationship out.\n\nReiterating my point from before, I just don't know if what I saw in my experience with him was his personality or emotional damage he was indirectly taking out on me. I think my number 1 fear is Jamie's health and safety in all of this, I'd never want her to be manipulated or harassed. Nobody deserves it, especially not her.", "Given your comment partly describing how bad the relationship with Mark was at times, I can see why you're reluctant to have to associate with him again even if he has supposedly changed for the better. The other commenter implying that you still have ownership of Mark is sickening in that context (I very much doubt an abusive ex would be referred to as \"sloppy seconds\").\n\nAnyway, NAH. You'll likely have to tell your friend your side of things (including that you do not want her to breakup just because of you, and that you want to still be friends with her) if you want her to understand your response. Hopefully the extra info will help you two maintain your friendship by navigating ways to either not have you have to be near/interact with Mark, you very slowly get used to Mark (who has hopefully changed for the better)'s existence (no double dates for the near future, that's for sure), or friend recognizes the same warning signs and breaks up with Mark.\n\nHoping your friend will understand and not try to impatiently push for a physical meeting between you and Mark. You can listen to your friend mention Mark in her life and get to know what he's probably like now through her. Best of luck!", "It was 3 years ago. You don't know what has happened in those last three years. You were a rebound after a long term relationship ended where you admit both of you were in a messy place.\n\nYou don't have to be best buddies with them and you don't have to go on couples dates with them. What you should do is not project your experiences onto your friend. Sit down and hear her out, if she's your best friend you should be able to have an honest conversation about it. NAH.", ">, I just don't know if what I saw in my experience with him was his personality or emotional damage he was indirectly taking out on me\n\nWell, was what he saw, in his experience with you, your true personality or a reaction to the emotional turmoil you had just been through?"]}
