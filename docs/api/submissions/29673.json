His mother moved from Africa 2 years ago and has lived with him ever since. She works full time and is in great health. She is now sponsoring 5 of his siblings to come to America. The catch is she lives with him and has ever since she came to the US. I know in some cultures parents living with you is normal. I asked him that and he said it is not normal for a mother to live with her son. Maybe the daughter but she is not to live with the son. Well he wants her to move in with us to the new home and allow the other siblings to come in as well to our newly purchased home. Let me add we have 4 kids of our own to take care of.  She is really a nice woman granted but she serves him and does everything for him including cooking. I feel it\u2019s a conflict of interest only because I can not be this fianc\u00e9 or wife if his mother is doing all of my duties. He will eat her cooking before he eats mine due to it being more authentic. She has no motivation to get her own place for his siblings. She enjoys living off of him rent free. I tried to tell him it\u2019s getting to the point where they are using him because he pays all the bills. She is bringing more siblings here and sadly to say doesn\u2019t even have her own place.   I spoke with him about not allowing them to move in and he felt like I was trying to put them out or I disliked them. I am picking up the slack of his parenting due to him trying to take care of them. I won\u2019t be able to have adult time comfortably with him with his mother in the next room or walk around my home comfortably seeing someone is always in our home. A lot of people at that. I don\u2019t want to start off my marriage living with his mother & 5 siblings. (3 adults 2 children) I don\u2019t want to seem rude or hateful.

You already have 4 kids but you didn\u2019t say whose they are so that is hard to have an opinion on. \n\nIt certainly is not fair for him to expect you to contribute financially for all those other people.

If you're not okay with this, you should end the engagement.

Does your fiance know that there's a minimum amount he has to make in order for the family to be sponsored? If his mother has applied for them, it's doubtful she makes enough due to her household size already, and will need a co-sponsor, which sounds like it would be your husband.

Your fianc\u00e9 should be putting a stop to this, but I\u2019m sure he is struggling with a sense of responsibility to his siblings. But regardless, he has to understand that your marriage is going to be doomed before it even begins if he is prioritizing everyone else over you.

If that is a hang up you are better to just call it a quits now before you guilt yourself into a situation that is going to start breading resentment and cause issues later down the line. You my even have to give him an ultimatum and go from there. But seriously don\u2019t force yourself into situation unless you are 100% comfortable with the outcome. If you have doubts it better to pause and serious think that to ignore your gut and regret it later.", "Tbd. I\u2019m curious what part of Africa his remaining siblings are trying immigrate from?

What is the family\u2019s motivation to move out of a rent free house with meals. Perhaps if it is sold as part of the divorce and their gravy train dries up. I\u2019m not trying to scare you; it\u2019s just concerning how he\u2019s completely ignoring your wants.", "NTA for how you feel, but I\u2019d put the brakes on this deal. His mom isn\u2019t going anywhere and his entire extended family will be living with him.", "NTA. You definitely have enough on your plate without having to be concerned with his mother living with you and your family. She\u2019s sounds overbearing and if it comes down to it, he may not bend on living with her and since she\u2019s adding more family to the mix, he\u2019s already on board .", "I would be out of my mind if I had 6 other people living in my house.  I would certainly reconsider buying a house with your boyfriend.  You should have a talk with your SO and ask him to make plans for his mother to move out as she has overstayed her welcome.  And then let her take care of the others, if that's even possible.", "NTA. But now you have to decide if you can continue to be 2nd class citizen in your own home. The first step is to file for child support, then once you\u2019ve got the ball rolling you will have to find somewhere else for you and your children to live. Don\u2019t have any more children with this man. Have you considered that you have effectively become his nanny/ bangmaid? Take a step back and look at your life from the outside. What would you say to someone in your situation? Wake up and get a life for yourself. Come on Girl!!", "If his mother is sponsoring 5 siblings she must be well off financially, or is your fianc\u00e9 a cosponsor for your mother?", "Absolutely not, protect your peace", "NTA. It's not fair to you to be a single parent because he is too busy with his family. And unless you have a mansion, I don't see how a house would be big enough to comfortably accommodate 12 people!", "NTA. It's entirely reasonable for you to have concerns about your fiance's mother and five siblings moving into your newly purchased home, especially when you already have four children to take care of. This is a complex situation that requires open and honest communication between you and your fiance.  \nYour concerns about the potential strain on your marriage, your privacy, and your ability to enjoy your new home are valid. It's essential to maintain boundaries and create a living situation that is comfortable for both of you. It's not about disliking his family but about ensuring that your family's dynamics are healthy and sustainable.  \nHave a calm and respectful conversation with your fiance to express your worries and feelings. Try to find a compromise that takes into account both your needs and his family's situation. It's important to make decisions together that work for your family unit, and this might involve finding alternative housing solutions for his mother and siblings that don't place an undue burden on you and your children.", "NTA.\n\nI  would nooot marry a guy who does not respect my wishes regarding who gets to live in my home.\n\nAt the same time, i understand that starting out in a new country can be difficult. And they need somewhere to start out. Even if the mother got a place of her own, she couldn't afford feeding 5 extra people most likely, until someone else gets a job.\n\nSo i would probably suggest you set a \"Move in and move out date\" for them - like 6 months.

It may be normal for them but it would significantly cramp your living situation and add power dynamics that you will not enjoy. You will no longer be the co-captain of your own house, he will defer to her and expect by proxy that you are too. I dont know how you didn't know this was coming but its not a sustainable situation. If you want to keep your relationship you will have to accept it and the unfortunate impacts it will have on you. He apparently is OK with it and is ready to put you at a disadvantage in order to support his larger family as he believes he is expected to do. It truly sounds like a great time when it's going good, but potentially a nightmare many other times. This sounds royally fuct. Tell him to man up, go make that crazy good money and support this plan elsewhere. Not saying kick him out but there needs to be boundaries or you're just delaying the inevitable disaster crisis. So very sorry :(", "NTA... he wants his mom and his wife because he wants all the work to be done for him. You will definitely be lower on the priority list and it will eventually ruin your relationship.  This should be your hill to fight on. Say no", "Nta. \n\nMaybe explain this way.\n\nI love mil but I need my home to be mine. If she is living here, then it's hers, and you have shown you choose her over me every time. I can't cook or clean, I can not make my home mine as she is the one you are letting run the house. I get no time to myself. I am taling on more parenting duty because you spend all your free time for her. \n\nI understand you wish to help your family, but I and our children are the family you CHOSE to have. We are not even first in your thoughts. We are not put first in our needs. \n\nI did not marry you to be a bedwarmer. To be a guest in my OWN home. And this is how it is. And now you want to add more people to our home. What of your children then? Less time as you help everyone else. \n\nI am sorry, but you are not listening to me and my feelings. Instead, you turn it to I don't like them. You need to listen that I need this from you. If you can not give me this, then it's time for a break from our relationship. It's time for therapy while I and the children get our own place. Because I refuse to not have them put before all others. I refuse to be a guest in my own home. I refuse to be pressured and guilted into letting more family move in. \n\nSo you need to think long and hard. Are my and the children's needs more important than you supporting extended family? Do you love us enough to give us what we need? Or will you continue to have your mother as your wife in all but the bedroom and expect me to accept that?\n\n\nHun it's time for the serious talk. It's time to make him decide if you and the kids' needs are going to be put first. It's time to be ready and willing to walk away with the kids if he refuses. Because all this is teaching your kids is MIL comes before everyone else. That their aunts/uncles will be more important. That they get whatever scraps are left of attention. And that is what will happen. His focus will be to help them adjust and whatever else and your kids will suffer. They will see they are not important. Not loved by their dad. They will grow up thinking this is ok and they deserve it. Unless you become a mama bear and show that this is not acceptable. You and the kids are important. That you refuse to let others make them feel less. From even their father. \n\nSo it's time for you to think and decide. What are you willing to put up with and accept. What line are you willing to draw and follow through on. If you are not willing to walk away, then honestly, he has shown his mom is first in his life, and you should give in and try and shield the kids as best you can. If you are willing to walk away you need to make sure he knows that you will do so and make sure he knows that you will take him to court for everything you can because mommas boy needs to grow up. That you will find a true man to love and support you and the kids both emotionally and mentally.

You are not in agreement that a nuclear family of you, him, and your children IS the ideal situation. You both have strong reasons for feeling the way you do.\n\nI don't think expecting him to shift his perception of immediate family from what it is to matching yours is realistic. There's a significant incompatibility here. Neither of you will be happy if you give up your position and align your life with your partner's. You would be overwhelmed, overcrowded and have no privacy or real control over your household's routines and boundaries. He would feel selfish and cruel, abandoning his mom and sibs to live his own comfortable life with you and the kids while the rest of his family struggles.\n\nI think it was unwise to buy a house together when this glaring incompatibility has been there all along.

Don't proceed with either until you know exactly what you want from the life your fiance is inflicting upon you, what you'll actually get and how much you can tolerate the difference between the two. If you have any doubts, you need to address them and make your decision before marriage and home ownership make things even harder.", "Paragraphs", "NTAH but you\u2019re not gonna win this one either. He may love you but everything that\u2019s important to him is tied into his mother and his \u201cother\u201d family. He sees himself as the successful man of the family who receives ego stroking from his mother for providing the family a good life.

If you are a part owner in the new property then stick your foot down and say NO.  You are not accommodation outlet for his family.  You are under no obligation to provide somewhere for them to stay.  His mother is an adult who can sort out her own accommodation.  His family can also get their own accommodation and pay three own way if they are trying to move to your country.  Stick your foot down on this and a big line in the sand.  Otherwise you may wish to reconsider both buying a place together and getting married.", "Nta but very naive. You got honey dicked by a black mamba straight out of Africa.

His family is coming to live with you but will not be permanent. They will get job, established and move out and his mom will most likely go with the family who needs her assistance.  You have to pick and choose your battles.  You didn\u2019t marry a family, you married a community, everyone will have a role; laundry, cooking, cleaning, school, transportation\u2026.

Stop purchasing a home with him don\u2019t get married to him\u2026 We have the culture where he\u2019s expected to support his family which is fine, but if that\u2019s not what you want then you\u2019re not compatible", "NTA.

If not, you need to carefully consider what a cross cultural relationship with this man would look like.\n\nYes, you are expected to live with the mother and/or the siblings. Depending on his culture. it's not even a question about not doing this. You need to find out what other cultural expectations there are and if you can live comfortably with them.  You need to have some serious talks before committing to marriage. Are the 4 kids both yours? Did you not talk about cultural expectations before you had them?", "Do not purchase a home with him. You two do not have the same needs and expectations. He wants to have *12* people in the house? That's definitely way too much to accept if you don't want it. And you don't. You're better off getting child support for your 4 children and letting him come visit when he wants to. If you put your money into buying a house for his family, they will never need to leave, because he doesn'twant them to. And if anything happens that changes his ability to earn, you'll be financially responsible for everyone, plus the mortgage and home maintenance. Don't do it.

NTA", "NTA because you don't want her to move in, but why is he still your fianc\u00e9? This is not going to change and will be a sore spot for you or him going forward.

Were there not any clues that he would do this?", "NTA, I\u2019m curious as to how they can afford the costs involved in this. Not just housing the sibs, but legal costs and all that, PLUS the costs of children. Is it financially feasible? Is getting a second place for mom an option?", "Break up with this man and sue him for child support.\n\nRight now you are signing up for living in hell. MIL and all those siblings will never move out. Husband will prioritize them rather than you and your kids. You will resent them all. You will hate your life.

This is a recipe for disaster and you will be the odd one out in all situations in your own home.\n\nReconsider this whole relationship and consider keeping this man as a fiancee and not a husband.  Speaking for myself, there is no way in hell I would commingle my finances or assets with this man.

I've also recently learned that if you sponsor someone to come to the US, you are responsible for all they do, and that includes financially. Does your fianc\u00e9e know this?
