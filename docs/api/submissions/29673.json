His mother moved from Africa 2 years ago and has lived with him ever since. She works full time and is in great health. She is now sponsoring 5 of his siblings to come to America. The catch is she lives with him and has ever since she came to the US. I know in some cultures parents living with you is normal. I asked him that and he said it is not normal for a mother to live with her son. Maybe the daughter but she is not to live with the son. Well he wants her to move in with us to the new home and allow the other siblings to come in as well to our newly purchased home. Let me add we have 4 kids of our own to take care of.  She is really a nice woman granted but she serves him and does everything for him including cooking. I feel it\u2019s a conflict of interest only because I can not be this fianc\u00e9 or wife if his mother is doing all of my duties. He will eat her cooking before he eats mine due to it being more authentic. She has no motivation to get her own place for his siblings. She enjoys living off of him rent free. I tried to tell him it\u2019s getting to the point where they are using him because he pays all the bills. She is bringing more siblings here and sadly to say doesn\u2019t even have her own place.   I spoke with him about not allowing them to move in and he felt like I was trying to put them out or I disliked them. I am picking up the slack of his parenting due to him trying to take care of them. I won\u2019t be able to have adult time comfortably with him with his mother in the next room or walk around my home comfortably seeing someone is always in our home. A lot of people at that. I don\u2019t want to start off my marriage living with his mother & 5 siblings. (3 adults 2 children) I don\u2019t want to seem rude or hateful.

You already have 4 kids but you didn\u2019t say whose they are so that is hard to have an opinion on. \n\nIt certainly is not fair for him to expect you to contribute financially for all those other people.

If you're not okay with this, you should end the engagement.

Does your fiance know that there's a minimum amount he has to make in order for the family to be sponsored? If his mother has applied for them, it's doubtful she makes enough due to her household size already, and will need a co-sponsor, which sounds like it would be your husband.

Your fianc\u00e9 should be putting a stop to this, but I\u2019m sure he is struggling with a sense of responsibility to his siblings. But regardless, he has to understand that your marriage is going to be doomed before it even begins if he is prioritizing everyone else over you.

If that is a hang up you are better to just call it a quits now before you guilt yourself into a situation that is going to start breading resentment and cause issues later down the line. You my even have to give him an ultimatum and go from there. But seriously don\u2019t force yourself into situation unless you are 100% comfortable with the outcome. If you have doubts it better to pause and serious think that to ignore your gut and regret it later.", "Tbd. I\u2019m curious what part of Africa his remaining siblings are trying immigrate from?

What is the family\u2019s motivation to move out of a rent free house with meals. Perhaps if it is sold as part of the divorce and their gravy train dries up. I\u2019m not trying to scare you; it\u2019s just concerning how he\u2019s completely ignoring your wants.", "NTA for how you feel, but I\u2019d put the brakes on this deal. His mom isn\u2019t going anywhere and his entire extended family will be living with him.", "NTA. You definitely have enough on your plate without having to be concerned with his mother living with you and your family. She\u2019s sounds overbearing and if it comes down to it, he may not bend on living with her and since she\u2019s adding more family to the mix, he\u2019s already on board .", "I would be out of my mind if I had 6 other people living in my house.  I would certainly reconsider buying a house with your boyfriend.  You should have a talk with your SO and ask him to make plans for his mother to move out as she has overstayed her welcome.  And then let her take care of the others, if that's even possible.", "NTA. But now you have to decide if you can continue to be 2nd class citizen in your own home. The first step is to file for child support, then once you\u2019ve got the ball rolling you will have to find somewhere else for you and your children to live. Don\u2019t have any more children with this man. Have you considered that you have effectively become his nanny/ bangmaid? Take a step back and look at your life from the outside. What would you say to someone in your situation? Wake up and get a life for yourself. Come on Girl!!", "If his mother is sponsoring 5 siblings she must be well off financially, or is your fianc\u00e9 a cosponsor for your mother?", "Absolutely not, protect your peace", "NTA. It's not fair to you to be a single parent because he is too busy with his family. And unless you have a mansion, I don't see how a house would be big enough to comfortably accommodate 12 people!", "NTA. It's entirely reasonable for you to have concerns about your fiance's mother and five siblings moving into your newly purchased home, especially when you already have four children to take care of. This is a complex situation that requires open and honest communication between you and your fiance.  \nYour concerns about the potential strain on your marriage, your privacy, and your ability to enjoy your new home are valid. It's essential to maintain boundaries and create a living situation that is comfortable for both of you. It's not about disliking his family but about ensuring that your family's dynamics are healthy and sustainable.  \nHave a calm and respectful conversation with your fiance to express your worries and feelings. Try to find a compromise that takes into account both your needs and his family's situation. It's important to make decisions together that work for your family unit, and this might involve finding alternative housing solutions for his mother and siblings that don't place an undue burden on you and your children.", "NTA.\n\nI  would nooot marry a guy who does not respect my wishes regarding who gets to live in my home.\n\nAt the same time, i understand that starting out in a new country can be difficult. And they need somewhere to start out. Even if the mother got a place of her own, she couldn't afford feeding 5 extra people most likely, until someone else gets a job.\n\nSo i would probably suggest you set a \"Move in and move out date\" for them - like 6 months.

It may be normal for them but it would significantly cramp your living situation and add power dynamics that you will not enjoy. You will no longer be the co-captain of your own house, he will defer to her and expect by proxy that you are too. I dont know how you didn't know this was coming but its not a sustainable situation. If you want to keep your relationship you will have to accept it and the unfortunate impacts it will have on you. He apparently is OK with it and is ready to put you at a disadvantage in order to support his larger family as he believes he is expected to do. It truly sounds like a great time when it's going good, but potentially a nightmare many other times. This sounds royally fuct. Tell him to man up, go make that crazy good money and support this plan elsewhere. Not saying kick him out but there needs to be boundaries or you're just delaying the inevitable disaster crisis. So very sorry :(", "NTA... he wants his mom and his wife because he wants all the work to be done for him. You will definitely be lower on the priority list and it will eventually ruin your relationship.  This should be your hill to fight on. Say no", "Nta. \n\nMaybe explain this way.\n\nI love mil but I need my home to be mine. If she is living here, then it's hers, and you have shown you choose her over me every time. I can't cook or clean, I can not make my home mine as she is the one you are letting run the house. I get no time to myself. I am taling on more parenting duty because you spend all your free time for her. \n\nI understand you wish to help your family, but I and our children are the family you CHOSE to have. We are not even first in your thoughts. We are not put first in our needs. \n\nI did not marry you to be a bedwarmer. To be a guest in my OWN home. And this is how it is. And now you want to add more people to our home. What of your children then? Less time as you help everyone else. \n\nI am sorry, but you are not listening to me and my feelings. Instead, you turn it to I don't like them. You need to listen that I need this from you. If you can not give me this, then it's time for a break from our relationship. It's time for therapy while I and the children get our own place. Because I refuse to not have them put before all others. I refuse to be a guest in my own home. I refuse to be pressured and guilted into letting more family move in. \n\nSo you need to think long and hard. Are my and the children's needs more important than you supporting extended family? Do you love us enough to give us what we need? Or will you continue to have your mother as your wife in all but the bedroom and expect me to accept that?\n\n\nHun it's time for the serious talk. It's time to make him decide if you and the kids' needs are going to be put first. It's time to be ready and willing to walk away with the kids if he refuses. Because all this is teaching your kids is MIL comes before everyone else. That their aunts/uncles will be more important. That they get whatever scraps are left of attention. And that is what will happen. His focus will be to help them adjust and whatever else and your kids will suffer. They will see they are not important. Not loved by their dad. They will grow up thinking this is ok and they deserve it. Unless you become a mama bear and show that this is not acceptable. You and the kids are important. That you refuse to let others make them feel less. From even their father. \n\nSo it's time for you to think and decide. What are you willing to put up with and accept. What line are you willing to draw and follow through on. If you are not willing to walk away, then honestly, he has shown his mom is first in his life, and you should give in and try and shield the kids as best you can. If you are willing to walk away you need to make sure he knows that you will do so and make sure he knows that you will take him to court for everything you can because mommas boy needs to grow up. That you will find a true man to love and support you and the kids both emotionally and mentally.

You are not in agreement that a nuclear family of you, him, and your children IS the ideal situation. You both have strong reasons for feeling the way you do.\n\nI don't think expecting him to shift his perception of immediate family from what it is to matching yours is realistic. There's a significant incompatibility here. Neither of you will be happy if you give up your position and align your life with your partner's. You would be overwhelmed, overcrowded and have no privacy or real control over your household's routines and boundaries. He would feel selfish and cruel, abandoning his mom and sibs to live his own comfortable life with you and the kids while the rest of his family struggles.\n\nI think it was unwise to buy a house together when this glaring incompatibility has been there all along.

When will your family of You, Him, and Your kids, be the focus? \n\nIf he sidesteps or doesnt want to answer or thinks your not being fair, while you are communicating in a healthy loving manner, then I feel bad for you and I hope it all works out.\n\n\nEDIT: Also you shouldnt say his family is using him unless you are sure that its negative like that. Supporting your family is life fulfilling.", "YTA It sounds as if this is a necessity.  You can't pay rent and sponsor 5 kids so you are asking your husband to not support his family and leave his siblings behind.  I think in this case you accepted a package deal.\n\nI think it's reasonable to set limits such as that they move out when 2 or 3 of them are financially independent, what alone time you do get etc  and set a goal in terms of years but it is unreasonable to ask him to basically abandon his family when they need him.\n\nOn the plus side I would think that you would be an integral part of the family if you did this with grace and accepted it is a 2-3 year period.  But I think it sounds like you aren't communicating openly with each other about this so I'm not sure how that is going to work out.", "NTA for not wanting to live with his extended family, you don\u2019t seem like his priority & neither are your children. I definitely wouldn\u2019t tie myself to a mortgage or marriage until you figure this out. Stop having anymore kids with him!", "NTA, first:don't buy a house until this is resolved. If you end up ending the relationship it will be much easier if you don't have a house together. It sounds like you will never be a priority in his life, his mom is. You have to decide if you're OK with that or not.", "NTA, it is totally unreasonable and unfair to expect you to be ok with that.", "NTA but this is probably a conversation that should have been had prior to the \u201cshall we buy a house\u201d one\u2026 maybe backtrack slightly\u2026", "I am confused that you said you have 4 kids together but you live separately and it sounds like he is financially supporting his mother and soon will support 4 siblings. \n\nIs he the father of your kids? If so, he probably can\u2019t support 10 people. You are going to be very poor if he is responsible for this many people. Do you work and support your kids now? \n\nIf he is going to support his mother and 4 siblings and all live with him, no way would I live with all of those people and support them. \n\nNTA. \n\nI personally would not be ok with this situation.", "Remember you marry him, you marry his family.  A house is cramped enough with 4 kids. I'm sorry, but what he's asking of you is ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA - the saying goes \"if he could, he would\" and in your case he is doing that for his mother, not you. He has priorities but you aren't included. \n\nReconsider your relationship because it's not going to change.", "NTA\nYou have a major culture clash. You need to decide if you want to live in a multi generation, extended family home forever as it appears that's what your husband expects. Don't buy a house together until you decide.", "You are so screwed.", "NTA- she has no plans of leaving\u2026.\nShe plans to mooch as long as possible she\u2019s even bringing more family to take over your house", "You\u2019re the meal ticket OP. \nThink hard about what you are getting into.", "HUGE RED FLAG, my advice to you is please do not purchase a home with him. Since he wants to house his entire family, he and his mum should purchase the property together, while if are able to afford it, get your own home and live there . How do you expect to live with 5 siblings in your new home? You need to put yourself and your kids first and also establish healthy boundaries with your partner, it's better for you to do all this now before you get married!", "Not easy being the 3rd person in a a marriage, based on what you have described your future fianc\u00e9 has not grown up, this is the time to reconsider staying with him or moving on your own. I suggest you consider seeking professional family therapy to help you make an educated decision .\nVery good luck to you", "Nta. But this is a bigger issue. You have different views on what your married life will be. Is this waht you want, because cancelling a wedding is cheaper than divorce. I know it's easy to say leave than do it, but do you want you and your kids lives to be secondary to his mums and siblings? I understand your fiance doesn't want to turn away from his family, but your views on family life are different and may simply be incompatible", "It is clear you two have different priorities. It sounds as if neither of you wants to live by the others preferred lifestyle. It also sounds like a large % of his income is leaving the nuclear family to support his extended family. At a minimum, I would not sign a loan with him as you may be stuck with the payments when he decides to spend on the extended family. Also, keep you bank accounts and credit card accounts separate. Personally I would grow very resentful of the situation and the marriage would not survive. You have to decide if you can live his way and your wants don\u2019t matter. If not, you should end this now and not move forward with purchasing a house together and marrying. NTA", "NTA.\nBut first this:\nIf you married him and he is (co) sponsoring his siblings then you are financially liable for them too, and will be for a long time. You can\u2019t just sponsor for them to come to the US and not provide for them.. and if they make debts then you are also liable.. so ask yourself if you want this financial burden having 4 kids already. It can bankrupt you and make your life financial hell!!\nAlso I don\u2019t think your fianc\u00e9 is ever going to be ok with not living with him mom and not sponsoring his siblings.. so you need to make a difficult choice", "Run, how old are these siblings sounds like you are going to be stuck with a load of leaches taking all your money. I am guessing they are all adults. Who\u2019s financially sponsoring all these siblings. Not to be unkind but I assume your an American citizen and he wasn\u2019t.", "Why did you have one let alone TWO kids with him?!\n\nPull the brakes on EVERYTHING & get out. Pretty sure he\u2019s only sleeping with you because most societies frown on sons & mothers sleeping together. \n\nIt\u2019s Oedipus Rex in the flesh!", "Good grief!!!!   It sounds like you didn\u2019t set boundaries in the beginning of this relationship.   It may be very hard to live in a new home with so many extended family members moving in with you.  Only you know what you can live with.    However. I will say if this actually happens you need to accept that you won\u2019t have personal time, either with your partner or even alone time?", "Nta but it sounds like your not compatible, he isn\u2019t going to change. It\u2019s up to you if you can accept it or not", "\"I don\u2019t want to start off my marriage living with his mother & 5 siblings.\"\n\n\"we have 4 kids of our own to take care of.\"\n\nIt sounds like for all practical purposes you already started off your marriage some time ago.", "NTA in any capacity, but I am willing to guess that both he and his mom are sponsoring the siblings as they\u2019re financially responsible for a set number of years so that they don\u2019t become of burden on the US (public assistance etc). \nThey may have to live with you for this and based on the wording of your post, you\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t know it. I\u2019m an American born child of immigrants who was married to an immigrant so I have seen this play out firsthand. \nYou need to sit down with your partner and find out how involved he is in the process and you can go forward from there. Good luck", "NTA but this is also not the man for you. He has clearly indicated that his birth family will always come before any family you have together. Call off this marriage before it's too late. It will never change.", "NTA Good luck, I really have no advice. But I sympathize with you. I don't see this relationship lasting. Are any of these other people going to work. I'm getting claustrophobic just thinking how crowded it will be", "Simple do not buy a house with him. Move out with your kids. He can choose to live with you and marry you or choose to live with his mummy and siblings. NTA  but stop talking and act.\n\nYou are a mother of 4, 2 of the kids are from a prior marriage. Its your duty to protect them and give them a good upbringing - and not be crammed in a home with 6 other people fighting for attention from their dad/step dad.  Your first two kids will get even more lost in all this.  Move out or kick him out - absolutely do not buy a house with him or marry him.", "NTA- it\u2019s not hateful to want your home for you, him and the kids. He was figuring that having children and then marrying you would trap you into supporting his entire extended family. Do not allow this, eventually, you will be pushed out of your own home and they will completely take over. They\u2019ll make your life a living hell. He won\u2019t care because his objective will be complete. I\u2019ve seen it many times and if the woman complains, she is made out to be some sort of racist to make her back down or she gets kicked out/alienated till she leaves.  Magically, he and his family have the house you worked for.\n\nTell him you are not willing to get married or buy a home together if this is the path his choosing. I\u2019m guessing being married, immigration will also take your finances into account. This is a hill to die on !!! Once here, it\u2019ll be impossible to undo.", "NTA but he\u2019s already told you basically what your life is gonna be like if you stay with him. He WILL choose his family .", "NTA but this marriage was clearly a mistake on your part.There should have been boundaries set right from the start OP.Leave and buy a house with ONLY your name on it.Stop funding this thankless family", "NTA. Do not marry this man. You will be responsible for ENTIRE family. They will consider you their servant and will be financially responsible for the expenses in their sponsorship and living while they are in this country.\n\nYou definately need to discuss this with your fiance and have him choose. Either you and your nuclear family or his family without you.\n\nThis is an invasion. You don't want you and your children to be collateral damage during the siege.", "NTA. Don\u2019t buy the house with him , it\u2019s a big mistake. He is a momma\u2019s boy. Kids or no kids you will always come last . Think long and hard if you could truly live like this .", "My sister has a house with a guest house.  Dad and Mom lived there for years, and each had their privacy.  Is it possible to create a guest house or cottage  on a part of your property? It would separate the family units, and give you more privacy in your home.", "NTA is nope that too. dump mummy\u2019s boy and get child support", "NTA how big is this house? It's you and your fianc\u00e9 with 4 kids plus his mother and they want another 5 siblings coming? so that's 12 ppl and he's supposed to support them all? That feels like a cramped house. 4 kids plus you and he make s full house. That's a min of a 4 bed already where all those siblings supposed to go? 3 are adults right do they have jobs there them plus the mother should move into s place with 2 non adults. And your right with so many of them your children would get neglected I feel. I would sit down and talk long and hard", "NTA but I fear that you have arrived at a dead end. You won't be able to get mommy out of the house, same with the rest of his family. That's basically a given. You need to decide if you want to spend the rest of your life with his family around. Other than that I would strongly advise against buying a house together with him. That would have disaster written all over it.", "NTA.  Don't buy the house. Even if you put money towards it and you're on the deed, it will never be your house because his family will be moving in no matter what you say.  I would seriously reconsider the marriage also", "NTA but I see both sides\n\nYou guys are just not compatible. Your MIL cooking traditional food for him doesn't diminish you as a wife. See that as the blessing that it is. Sponsoring takes a long time so they are likely not going to move in next month.\n\nAre the 4 children bio kids of both you and him? Maybe it is time to walk away from this relationship as you are not culturally compatible", "NTA.  You may have to rethink this relationship.  His priority is his family and that family is not you and your children.  He's obviously not hearing you or just doesn't care.  You say you are \"purchasing\" a home.  It this process is not complete, then PLEASE stop, drop and roll.  You'll be locked into a house that you have no say in who lives there, no privacy and you'll be run ragged.  You and your fiance need to resolve his family issues before they just get bigger in the form of an additional 5 people living with you.  Good luck.", "Yes, this is what I wondered - who is on the immigration paperwork to sponsor all of these siblings? Is it Mom (with what money?) or husband? \n\nIf husband is the one who signed as sponsor, did he discuss it with OP or just do it on his own? That is a massive commitment and potential risk to their marital finances, and should definitely have been discussed with OP.", "He is the cosponsor and did this without speaking to me", "Maybe she wants permission to be angry?", "The thing is though, it\u2019s not likely that they\u2019ll move out. OP will never be the woman of the house. She\u2019ll have no authority.", "Can you afford to buy a house by yourself? For just you and your 4kids? I don't think this man is ever gonna choose you. So you have to choose yourself and your kids. Don't buy a house with him.\n\nYTA to yourself if you continue with this relationship.\n\nEdit: After the siblings, it's gonna be extended family. Aunties, cousins, etc. You will never truly have the house to yourself.", "Please don\u2019t buy a house with him and that arrangement will definitely impact your kids negatively.", "Don't buy anything with him until you solve this issue. Though I see an entire Forrest od red flags and can't imagine you didn't see any until now.\n\n\nNTA but make this a Hill to die on cause otherwise you will never have free reign in your own home", "Get a hobby. Jeez.", "It is not acceptable to put your kids through this chaos. Can you afford to live alone? Look into it. He\u2019s telling you- you can handle his actual responsibilities while he takes care of adults who can care for themselves.", "Regarding \u201cwith what money?\u201d: OP mentioned that she works full time, but pays no rent.", "So he lives with his mother not you? How does it work?", "Please do not buy a house with your fianc\u00e9. One of the requirements to sponsor an alien relative is having a place to live. If you buy that house your mother in-law and family will not leave for at least 10 years. The truth is she will never leave. Save yourself the headaches, heart aches, fights and stressful life that is ahead for your and your children. You and your children come first.", "It doesn't even feel like an ask to me, he seems like it's going to happen whether she wants it or not", "You are marrying into a family, and this is the culture of their family. If you don\u2019t like it you will likely have to part ways.", "When you sponsor someone you have to prove you can support them financially for like 10 years or something. OPs mom would have to make like 6x what it costs to support someone (as defined by USCIS). So it's possible but unlikely", "Leave you mean?"]}
