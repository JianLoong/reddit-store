His mother moved from Africa 2 years ago and has lived with him ever since. She works full time and is in great health. She is now sponsoring 5 of his siblings to come to America. The catch is she lives with him and has ever since she came to the US. I know in some cultures parents living with you is normal. I asked him that and he said it is not normal for a mother to live with her son. Maybe the daughter but she is not to live with the son. Well he wants her to move in with us to the new home and allow the other siblings to come in as well to our newly purchased home. Let me add we have 4 kids of our own to take care of.  She is really a nice woman granted but she serves him and does everything for him including cooking. I feel it\u2019s a conflict of interest only because I can not be this fianc\u00e9 or wife if his mother is doing all of my duties. He will eat her cooking before he eats mine due to it being more authentic. She has no motivation to get her own place for his siblings. She enjoys living off of him rent free. I tried to tell him it\u2019s getting to the point where they are using him because he pays all the bills. She is bringing more siblings here and sadly to say doesn\u2019t even have her own place.   I spoke with him about not allowing them to move in and he felt like I was trying to put them out or I disliked them. I am picking up the slack of his parenting due to him trying to take care of them. I won\u2019t be able to have adult time comfortably with him with his mother in the next room or walk around my home comfortably seeing someone is always in our home. A lot of people at that. I don\u2019t want to start off my marriage living with his mother & 5 siblings. (3 adults 2 children) I don\u2019t want to seem rude or hateful. I just want to enjoy my home & family without 6 extra people we are responsible for taking care of.

He is happy having his mother be his mother.  You will never cook as good, not that you aren\u2019t able but no one cooks like mom.  You already have 4 kids but you didn\u2019t say whose they are so that is hard to have an opinion on. \n\nIt certainly is not fair for him to expect you to contribute financially for all those other people.  Mommy needs to find another house or you need a new fianc\u00e9?", "NTA, but this is almost certainly a make or break point with your fianc\u00e9. If you're not okay with this, you should end the engagement. There is absolutely no chance that a mother planning to move five of her kids to the US is going to be okay with you saying she needs to support herself and those are all your fianc\u00e9s siblings.", "INFO: who's footing the bill for the other family members to immigrate to the US? Does your fiance know that there's a minimum amount he has to make in order for the family to be sponsored? If his mother has applied for them, it's doubtful she makes enough due to her household size already, and will need a co-sponsor, which sounds like it would be your husband. Does he know he would be responsible for them for 10 years? Are you ok with this?", "NTA but I'd question marriage under these circumstances.", "Walk him through the numbers about what happens if you divorce him and get child support.  NTA", "NTA. Set your boundaries now, and enforce them, because once they move in, it seems like they have no intention of moving on.", "You are definitely NTA. I do worry for you though. Your fianc\u00e9 should be putting a stop to this, but I\u2019m sure he is struggling with a sense of responsibility to his siblings. But regardless, he has to understand that your marriage is going to be doomed before it even begins if he is prioritizing everyone else over you. If he can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to do that, he shouldn\u2019t be getting married.", "info:\n\nHis mom has always lived with him.  Did your fiancee say that would ever change?\n\nHow long have you two been engaged?\n\nDoes hi mom help with your 4 kids?\n\nDid your fiance explain when You met him, that his and his mother's plans was to sponsor his siblings?\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "NTA\u2026 definitely hold off on purchasing that home if you can and you are going to have to sit down and have a serious conversation with him and tell him you are not comfortable with and do not want his family to move in with you guys. If that is a hang up you are better to just call it a quits now before you guilt yourself into a situation that is going to start breading resentment and cause issues later down the line. You my even have to give him an ultimatum and go from there. But seriously don\u2019t force yourself into situation unless you are 100% comfortable with the outcome. If you have doubts it better to pause and serious think that to ignore your gut and regret it later.", "Tbd. I\u2019m curious what part of Africa his remaining siblings are trying immigrate from? Is it a dangerous place?", "Absolutely NTA. But do not get married until your boundaries with your future husband are established.", "NTA if your husband does not stand up for you he never will and his family will never leave; while your kids will suffer loss of his attention, affection and loss of finances.\n\nI would give him an ultimatum and stick to it. What is the family\u2019s motivation to move out of a rent free house with meals. Perhaps if it is sold as part of the divorce and their gravy train dries up. I\u2019m not trying to scare you; it\u2019s just concerning how he\u2019s completely ignoring your wants.", "NTA for how you feel, but I\u2019d put the brakes on this deal. His mom isn\u2019t going anywhere and his entire extended family will be living with him.", "NTA. You definitely have enough on your plate without having to be concerned with his mother living with you and your family. She\u2019s sounds overbearing and if it comes down to it, he may not bend on living with her and since she\u2019s adding more family to the mix, he\u2019s already on board .", "I would be out of my mind if I had 6 other people living in my house.  I would certainly reconsider buying a house with your boyfriend.  You should have a talk with your SO and ask him to make plans for his mother to move out as she has overstayed her welcome.  And then let her take care of the others, if that's even possible.", "NTA. But now you have to decide if you can continue to be 2nd class citizen in your own home. The first step is to file for child support, then once you\u2019ve got the ball rolling you will have to find somewhere else for you and your children to live. Don\u2019t have any more children with this man. Have you considered that you have effectively become his nanny/ bangmaid? Take a step back and look at your life from the outside. What would you say to someone in your situation? Wake up and get a life for yourself. Come on Girl!!", "If his mother is sponsoring 5 siblings she must be well off financially, or is your fianc\u00e9 a cosponsor for your mother?", "Absolutely not, protect your peace", "NTA. It's not fair to you to be a single parent because he is too busy with his family. And unless you have a mansion, I don't see how a house would be big enough to comfortably accommodate 12 people!", "NTA. It's entirely reasonable for you to have concerns about your fiance's mother and five siblings moving into your newly purchased home, especially when you already have four children to take care of. This is a complex situation that requires open and honest communication between you and your fiance.  \nYour concerns about the potential strain on your marriage, your privacy, and your ability to enjoy your new home are valid. It's essential to maintain boundaries and create a living situation that is comfortable for both of you. It's not about disliking his family but about ensuring that your family's dynamics are healthy and sustainable.  \nHave a calm and respectful conversation with your fiance to express your worries and feelings. Try to find a compromise that takes into account both your needs and his family's situation. It's important to make decisions together that work for your family unit, and this might involve finding alternative housing solutions for his mother and siblings that don't place an undue burden on you and your children.", "NTA.\n\nI  would nooot marry a guy who does not respect my wishes regarding who gets to live in my home.\n\nAt the same time, i understand that starting out in a new country can be difficult. And they need somewhere to start out. Even if the mother got a place of her own, she couldn't afford feeding 5 extra people most likely, until someone else gets a job.\n\nSo i would probably suggest you set a \"Move in and move out date\" for them - like 6 months. And say that if they dont move out, you will.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

It may be normal for them but it would significantly cramp your living situation and add power dynamics that you will not enjoy. You will no longer be the co-captain of your own house, he will defer to her and expect by proxy that you are too. I dont know how you didn't know this was coming but its not a sustainable situation. If you want to keep your relationship you will have to accept it and the unfortunate impacts it will have on you. He apparently is OK with it and is ready to put you at a disadvantage in order to support his larger family as he believes he is expected to do. It truly sounds like a great time when it's going good, but potentially a nightmare many other times. This sounds royally fuct. Tell him to man up, go make that crazy good money and support this plan elsewhere. Not saying kick him out but there needs to be boundaries or you're just delaying the inevitable disaster crisis. So very sorry :(", "NTA... he wants his mom and his wife because he wants all the work to be done for him. You will definitely be lower on the priority list and it will eventually ruin your relationship.  This should be your hill to fight on. Say no", "Nta. \n\nMaybe explain this way.\n\nI love mil but I need my home to be mine. If she is living here, then it's hers, and you have shown you choose her over me every time. I can't cook or clean, I can not make my home mine as she is the one you are letting run the house. I get no time to myself. I am taling on more parenting duty because you spend all your free time for her. \n\nI understand you wish to help your family, but I and our children are the family you CHOSE to have. We are not even first in your thoughts. We are not put first in our needs. \n\nI did not marry you to be a bedwarmer. To be a guest in my OWN home. And this is how it is. And now you want to add more people to our home. What of your children then? Less time as you help everyone else. \n\nI am sorry, but you are not listening to me and my feelings. Instead, you turn it to I don't like them. You need to listen that I need this from you. If you can not give me this, then it's time for a break from our relationship. It's time for therapy while I and the children get our own place. Because I refuse to not have them put before all others. I refuse to be a guest in my own home. I refuse to be pressured and guilted into letting more family move in. \n\nSo you need to think long and hard. Are my and the children's needs more important than you supporting extended family? Do you love us enough to give us what we need? Or will you continue to have your mother as your wife in all but the bedroom and expect me to accept that?\n\n\nHun it's time for the serious talk. It's time to make him decide if you and the kids' needs are going to be put first. It's time to be ready and willing to walk away with the kids if he refuses. Because all this is teaching your kids is MIL comes before everyone else. That their aunts/uncles will be more important. That they get whatever scraps are left of attention. And that is what will happen. His focus will be to help them adjust and whatever else and your kids will suffer. They will see they are not important. Not loved by their dad. They will grow up thinking this is ok and they deserve it. Unless you become a mama bear and show that this is not acceptable. You and the kids are important. That you refuse to let others make them feel less. From even their father. \n\nSo it's time for you to think and decide. What are you willing to put up with and accept. What line are you willing to draw and follow through on. If you are not willing to walk away, then honestly, he has shown his mom is first in his life, and you should give in and try and shield the kids as best you can. If you are willing to walk away you need to make sure he knows that you will do so and make sure he knows that you will take him to court for everything you can because mommas boy needs to grow up. That you will find a true man to love and support you and the kids both emotionally and mentally. Because you deserve that.", "You knew about his relationship with his mum before you married him and had kids.  \nWhy did you choose to have kids and buy a house with him ?", "YTA if you purchase a home with him and marry him.  Mom is staying, he wants mom to stay.  No way to know when or if his siblings will move out.\n\nHe is showing you who he truly is and how he will treat you and the kids.  He didn\u2019t consult you before telling his mom she can move in to your new joint home, nor before he told her to bring his siblings.  A real partner would recognize he must discuss these matters with you. He neglects his children to attend to his mom.  His money goes first to his mom and siblings.  He doesn\u2019t treat you with respect or love BEFORE you buy the house and move in and get married.  This will only get worse AFTER you buy the house.  He prioritizes his mom and siblings over you and his own children.\n He isn\u2019t a good partner or a good dad, and you know you want both qualities in a man.", "NTA! Heeellll no. Unfortunately this might be a very difficult fight with both your husband and his mom.", "NTA", "NTA. You need to put yourself your kids and your sanity before your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family.

Of course, he wants mom to live with him since she does everything.

If that's what you really want, hit the pause button.  Now.\n\nDo not continue with the purchase of a new home, and don't proceed with marrying until you sit down with your fiance, hash things out, and get on the same page. Going forward before the situation is resolved is not a smart idea.\n\nYour fiance's mom has made it clear she has no intention of living on her own, and he's fine with that. Buying a house now is just going to leave you stuck.", "NTA. You need to decide for yourself if you really want to stay with him or not. Your fianc\u00e9 seems that he will always put his mother above you so you have a lot of thinking to do.", "NAH\nThis could be a cultural difference. He prioritizes family, your extended family if you marry him. This is his mom and his siblings. His mom has lived with him since she came to this country. What made you think he would change with marriage? In a sense, THEY are his immediate family while you are potential family. You are not in agreement that a nuclear family of you, him, and your children IS the ideal situation. You both have strong reasons for feeling the way you do.\n\nI don't think expecting him to shift his perception of immediate family from what it is to matching yours is realistic. There's a significant incompatibility here. Neither of you will be happy if you give up your position and align your life with your partner's. You would be overwhelmed, overcrowded and have no privacy or real control over your household's routines and boundaries. He would feel selfish and cruel, abandoning his mom and sibs to live his own comfortable life with you and the kids while the rest of his family struggles.\n\nI think it was unwise to buy a house together when this glaring incompatibility has been there all along. Were you expecting him to change so drastically? Did you think you'd force him to your preference using the house or marriage as your leverage?", "NTA but you should set it with him long time a go.", "NTA. If you haven\u2019t purchased a home together yet I would have a very serious conversation with your fianc\u00e9 about this. Your at a point where you can explain that you aren\u2019t willing to living with his mother and siblings. You don\u2019t really have to have a reason you just don\u2019t want to do to it so the choice would appear that he buys a house with you or stays where he is. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s is one to make any concessions over.", "NTA\n\nBut do you truly want to marry someone far more beholden to his family than his future wife. And it will only get worse and be more demanding and entitled after marriage.\n\nGranted, the is from a US/western perspective, but the path you\u2019re following now feels unbearable to most of us. \n\nI don\u2019t mean that as judgmental - only that I greatly sympathize with your situation if you really don\u2019t have a choice per made up \u201ccustoms\u201d.

How is his mother able to sponsor all these folks?  Also, these days that can take YEARS.  Are you sure they're not just coming to \"visit\" and plan to overstay their visas?

Am I misunderstanding this?\n\nIf this is, indeed, true, then your BF's commitment is to his mother, and now to his siblings, far exceeds his commitment to you and the children you've created together.  \n\nThe notion that you're supposed to have six people in addition to your FH and the 4 children is when you don't want that is ridiculous.  This level of disrespect of your desires is pretty far over the top.\n\nIf your BF wanted to live with you and have that intimacy, he would already live with you, not his mother.  \n\nGet out.

You have to be sure that this arrangement won\u2019t impact your children\u2019s lives in a negative ways.  Just two new siblings will be a big adjustment for all four kids.  Then for more to trickle into the mix?  Five more siblings (who\u2019s siblings, grown or kids, ages, genders). That is 12 people living in a house.  How many rooms and who will have to share?  Do you know any of these things?  These are essentially strangers to you and your kids.  Moving to where you are, are they culturally aware of the changes or how things work?  How much support are you going to be expected to provide for these people? \n\nMaybe move inwith them for a while before buying a house to see how it goes, before the others arrive.
