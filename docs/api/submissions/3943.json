What you have isn\u2019t classic insomnia. You\u2019re able to sleep 6-7 hours on a regular schedule. My type of insomnia is 2-3 hours for nights at a time. Have you been seen by a doctor? With chronic insomnia you can get a multitude of side effects that negatively affect your life. \n\nBtw when I have big events like that come up, I follow routines and my medication properly. I make sure I\u2019m sticking to the same exercise and diet to ensure sleeping. I avoid alcohol and caffeine. What are your habits with diet and sleep?", "Check out delayed sleep phase syndrome, it\u2019s an actual medical condition where your sleep phase is delayed and instead of sleeping from, let\u2019s say 9-5, you sleep from 4 - 12. I\u2019ve heard people with delayed sleep phase syndrome talk about how they cannot function during their sleep time and being awake during their sleep time isn\u2019t an easy option for them. It\u2019s not like waking up at 2 for a flight and getting a cup of coffee, they\u2019ve talked about how they literally can\u2019t drive or do basic tasks during their sleep time. You should really speak to a doctor about your condition because it is truly negatively affecting your life.\n\nYTA but I also think you have an undiagnosed medical condition and your family should make an effort to accommodate that.", "YTA\n\nYou're a night owl, not an insomniac. You yourself just said that you get plenty of sleep when you sleep on your preferred schedule. \n\nThat's not a medical condition. That's a personal preference. \n\nSo your title really should be, 'I don't want to adjust my chosen sleep schedule to attend my sister's wedding. AITA?' \n\nAnd the answer is yeah. We all have our priorities, and you just made yours very clear to your family.", "I have INSANE insomnia (longest stretch awake was ~70hrs). A) This is not what you are describing B) Just be tired C) Get over yourself YTA", "Sounds like you have delayed sleep phase disorder - not insomnia \n\nEven though I sympathise with the disorder, YTA in this situation. In the 30 years I was undiagnosed I still managed to attend several weddings and other important early events. Yes I was exhausted a lot of the time especially as I worked a day job, it's like having permanent jetlag, but for a single day you can make the effort to fit with everyone else's bodyclock. If its that much of an issue to wake up you can just stay awake and treat the wedding like an evening event and try and fit in a power nap. Its totally doable, I've done it on multiple occasions. \n\nIts been hard work but I've managed to get my circadian rhythm pretty much under control using melatonin, a sad lamp and restructuring my eating times. But it's on me to manage my condition, not for the rest of the world to change their plans. I get that it's difficult to to fit with others circadian rhythms everyday when you have DSPD, but you are only having to do this for one day.", "YTA\n\nAs someone who has suffered from insomnia (1-3 hrs a night, sometimes going 24+ hours of no sleep) I can tell u it doesn't take much to chug a few redbulls and be there for such an important day. But ig it's not that important to u if u prefer ur 8 hr full rest.", "YTA \n\nIf my sister invited me to a wedding at 2am I would drink some coffee and show up with bells on. You\u2019re kind of a jerk.", "NTA. It's an invitation, not a summons, even if it IS your sister. I would not say she should plan her wedding around your unconventional sleep schedule, it's her day. That being said, if it's that important that you be there, so much that she's flying off the handle when you tell her you can't make it, maybe she should have. This is not a new thing for you, though it sounds like she's never respected you enough regarding your biologically demanded sleep cycle. If she wasn't so combative about it, and you have a good relationship, maybe tough it out. But that is not a requirement. If you can deal with the familial guilt, drama, and other fallout, do what you want.", "YTA\n\nMostly because you expect others to plan life events around your sleep schedule. People suffer from insomnia or work night shifts and still manage to make it for events. There would be no harm to try and have a more early wake up time for a week to go to the event. It won't wreck your lifestyle", "Ive worked night shift for a majority of my career. Im talking 12 hour night shifts that turn into 14-15 hour sometimes, not including drive home. My family always went on as usual and I would MAKE time to attend important family functions. When my brother got married I was working 2 FT jobs and going to school full time. I made it. I was dead tired and left early, but I made all parts of their celebration. \n\nYTA. \n\nAdapt and get over yourself. I know its hard, but you either have to suck it up or finally go to a doctor and get it taken care of. Either way this is YOUR responsibility.", "Yta .. the world doesn't revolve around u or your sleep schedule nor should she have to adjust her time ... Kinda crappy u don't wanna go for that reason... I wouldn't talk to u either of I was her especially after laughing at her", "You have a month to figure out your sleep schedule. My dad has really really (ad infinitum) bad insomnia. You don't. You get 6-7 hours of sleep lol. With sleeping pills, you can easily shift the hours around whilst being grateful you actually get to sleep. \n\nFigure out your sleep schedule and apologize to your sister. This is one of those things where if you don't grow up and figure out the world (and her WEDDING, no less!) does not revolve around you then your relationship will likely never fully recover.\n\nYTA", "I also have severe insomnia and generally sleep around 5am. \n\nThis is your sisters wedding. Missing one sleep cycle won't kill you.", "Either this is a joke or you are.", "NTA\n\nIf your difficulty sleeping at night was severe enough to complete high school online, it should be a given if your sister wants you at her wedding she needs to make accommodations.\n\nAll the YTA voters are acting like you just chose to not sleep the night before the wedding whereas this a chronic problem. \n\nInsomnia problems have a large variety from having difficulty falling asleep to waking up too early. Sounds like you can manage your insomnia long term because you get 8 hours sleep daily.\n\nI too have difficulty falling asleep when I am going through hard times but I wake up after 8 hours no matter when I fall asleep. It is torture trying and failing to fall asleep the night before important events.\n\nJust because OP laughed at the inconsiderate expectations of her sister doesn\u2019t make her an asshole.", "NTA. I had a housemate who had similar issues and it was painful. I would say to skip the brunch and attend the ceremony, but it\u2019s a medical issue.", "YTA \n\nAs someone who worked nights for 7 years, sometimes I had to miss a little sleep to be there for the ones I love. Life is just a little bit harder when you\u2019re not on a \u201cday shift\u201d schedule but it is your job to navigate that not your sister\u2019s.", "Im going with NAH.\n\nYou aren\u2019t required to attend her wedding, but as her sister I can see why she she\u2019d want you there. It wasn\u2019t great to laugh at her, but if this is something that\u2019s been going on for a decade, seems like she\u2019d know you\u2019d be sleeping. \nAlso, starting the wedding festivities at 10am seems really early. Are they needing to travel the same day as the wedding or something? Why is it so early? \n\nAlso repeating what others have said about seeing a doctor. Maybe have a sleep study done. Usually insomnia means difficulty sleeping, period, not difficulty sleeping during \u201cregular\u201d sleep hours", "YTA here. I struggled with insomnia my whole life. I just couldn\u2019t sleep. I would lie awake all night. I went to tons of doctors and \u201ctried everything\u201d. In my opinion, the truth is that you don\u2019t really have insomnia, your sleep schedule is just fucked up. It takes actually work and effort to fix it. If you can\u2019t put in effort to made it to a 10am wedding brunch, you aren\u2019t going to put in the effort to fix this.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s ONE day. One! And it\u2019s your sisters wedding. Of course she\u2019s not speaking to you. You\u2019re being selfish and inflexible. \n\nDrink an espresso, put on your brunch attire and get over yourself. You can sleep your regular schedule the next day.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t goin to die if you\u2019re sleepy for a day. The world isn\u2019t going to end. You\u2019re just extremely selfish and def have main character syndrome. The world does not revolve around your inability to get on a normal schedule.", "YTA\n\nI'm sure you've been told over and over again that you need to seriously look at working on this. But that's because you do. Right now you're facing permanently damaging your relationship with your sister over it and while you say this is the first time you've had an issue like this i can guarantee it won't be the last. There's going to be more weddings, events, anniversaries, births, deaths etc. And they're not going to comform to your schedule. \n\nI know it'll probably suck for a day but Right now what it looks like to your sister is that you're choosing a day of being tired over one of the most important days of her life. It'll look like you just don't care enough about her.\n\nI don't understand some of these comments, your sister isn't the asshole. She planned a wedding at the time most weddings happen, when most people are awake and available and you laughed at her and demanded she change it for you? \n\nApologise, do everything you can to be there because you will regret it if you don't. And hey, it's her wedding she's also going to be exhausted.", "I\u2019d N A H if she\u2019d had been upset you couldn\u2019t be there without being angry at you, but as a lifelong insomniac you\u2019re getting a NTA.  \n\nWhy she\u2019s the AH, is based on her dismissive of your insomnia prior to the wedding. A lot of people without chronic insomnia don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d. They think you\u2019re being lazy or if you just did xyz you\u2019d be fine; but chronic insomnia is trying everything and it not working so you cling to those precious hours of sleep you can get because without them you are a non-functional adult. That isn\u2019t hyperbole, people literally can\u2019t function if they don\u2019t get enough sleep. I\u2019ve had to stop driving when I\u2019ve had some long stretches of extreme insomnia because it is too complex a task to think through.", "YTA. If I take your comparison of your sister's ask being like asking a regular sleeper to come to an event at 2:30 AM, it honestly makes you look worse. If my sister had a wedding at 2:30 AM, I'd wake my ass up to be at my SISTER'S WEDDING. No way would I miss that. It's a day of sleepiness, you'll survive. Your entitlement is shocking", "YTA and a crappy sibling. What do you do for work? What about if you\u2019re in a relationship and they want to make daytime plans. God forbid you have kids. \nGrow up and get on a regular sleep schedule.", "NAH", "YTA. I have insomnia, but I still show up to work when I fall asleep at 5:30 and wake up at 8:00. You sometimes have to deal with feeling like shit, because that's just how life is sometimes. Don't miss your sisters wedding for 1 day of sleep. Be tired, but be there, and take the next day off if you need a recovery day after.", "YTA as an insomniac myself, I would never think about missing something that important with that poor excuse. I would rather not sleep and try to at least be there for her even if I look/desperately am tired than just miss it completely (and I hate my sister so it tells you).", "YTA. This is your sister's wedding. If you don't want a relationship with your sister, do whatever you want, but it's not crazy to ask an immediate family member to find a way to attend your wedding. If you cannot get up for an event at 10 am one time in your life, you need to see a doctor for your sleeping issues.", "Plain and simple YTA", "YTA.\n\nI also suffer from terrible insomnia. Recently, I had a terrifying experience in which, even with medication, I couldn\u2019t sleep for two nights and three days. It\u2019s accompanied by atrocious depression and anxiety. I mention this to convey that I know how debilitating it can be.\n\nThat said, you should be able to get yourself somewhere by noon for a special occasion.\n\nFrankly, you need to grow up and take control of your health. If your condition is that debilitating, you are in dire need of serious, probably in-patient, medical, including psychiatric, help.\n\nAlso, your attitude sucks. Not everything is about you, and your laughter was crude and misplaced.", "YTA and a bit self centered. You can be tired and still be there for your sister. Why not try skipping your sleep one day and fight it until the evening to see if it helps. You have time to experiment beforehand to try and reset your circadian rhythm. Maybe try some sleep aids, cutting out caffeine after 2 pm, and adjusting your diet. You also do not have insomnia, you just have an unhealthy sleep schedule.", "Yta- I work a 9-5 and if my sister was getting married at 2:00am I\u2019d be there. Have you ever been to a Doctor?", "YTA. \ud83d\ude02. Plenty of people who work 3rd shift are able to attend family weddings. You have plenty of time to plan and adjust for naps.

You sound absolutely insufferable. \n\nWhat you\u2019re describing doesn\u2019t sound like insomnia at all! It sounds like you stay up all night then sleep most of the day, like a baby you have your days and nights confused. Regardless, ONE DAY out of your oh so delicate life can manage to attend your sister\u2019s wedding. \n\nHanna doesn\u2019t you an apology at all, ffs! YOU owe her one. Honestly, she should just rescind her bridesmaid invitation because you definitely seem the type to cause drama when things don\u2019t go your way. Her wedding isn\u2019t about you and your sleep schedule. If you cared about her you\u2019d suck it up and deal for one day.", "YTA - I understand about your insomnia, but have you gone to a doctor? Also that is no excuse. I worked a third shift schedule so I slept just like you all the time. I had so many family events during the day and my time sleeping that I had to stay awake for and be there for. I did it because family is very important. So stop acting like a child and being entitled. Do what you need to to be there for your sister and go to the doctor.", "If my sister was getting married at 2am I\u2019d go\u2026 And I work a 9-5. YTA.", "YTA \n\nIf my sister planned a wedding at 2am, I'd see that as an odd choice, but absolutely would attend and do everything I can sonI wouldn't have to leave early, because it doesn't fit my sleep patterns. \n\nI get how getting shit for your schedule makes you hardened against criticizm, but you overshot here.", "Your sleep schedule for ONE day is more important than your sisters\u2026 wedding? OP the world isn\u2019t going yo change the way it works for YOU and to expect it to is??? YTA ofc", "YTA. You don't have insomnia just a weird sleeping pattern?", "YTA\n\nIt's your sister's wedding. I would apologize if I was in your place and buy as many coffees as I needed. You need to be there.", "I\u2019ve been a second/third shift worker for five years, and reading your post made me legitimately upset. \n\nYou\u2019re claiming a condition that you have literally never lived, and having truly suffered because of serious sleep issues myself, you\u2019re coming off as a major brat. \n\nPeople I work with do this constantly. I and MANY coworkers have suffered from night-shift syndrome at various points. which is a diagnosed, debilitating condition that impacts your quality of life.\n\nYou don\u2019t have that or a medical condition of any kind. Calling your sleep-schedule insomnia is immature, IMHO. Full stop. \n\n\n\nps for context\u2026.\n\nMy schedule is T 4:30p-6A, W 7:30-7A, F&S 10:30-10:30 (sometimes later) and even I can adjust my schedule. It takes about a week of planning. Sometimes it involves pulling an almost all-nighter. For example, in your case after I wake up at 9P for work Friday, I would have to go straight to the wedding from work. Then take off Saturday night or alternately take off Friday, do a light turnaround Thursday into Friday, and get up right before the wedding or get a light sleep around 3A-8:30A before the 10A events \n\nI am not a superhero. I really like my job so I willingly and gladly make the sacrifice because loving my job makes life easy. If I can do it\u2026 you can definitely do it. \n\nPS\u2026. If I were the sister I would be incredibly upset that you didn\u2019t go for this reason. However, I don\u2019t think I would miss you since you sound unpleasant. Good luck!", "Yta, it's one day. Sounds like you have other reasons for not wanting to go. If I was your sister and this was the excuse you gave me for not going, I'd be pissed too. It sounds like you don't care about others. It's not like she is asking for a week trip or something. As a 9-5er, if someone invited be to a wedding at 2am I'd go. I'd be annoyed cause huh? But I'd go cause it's one day.", "YTA. I was leaning to no one was, but you saying she needs to plan things around your schedule... her own wedding, at that, is absolutely ludicrous. Its her wedding. You said you were excited for her, I imagine you would WANT to be there but you've kind of given up on ever addressing your insomnia so you've resigned yourself to missing  this important event. \n\nits absolutely not impossible for you to make it. You take melatonin or something to help go to sleep earlier, you set an alarm on your phone every 2 minutes and put the phone on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed. I used to work overnight in a hotel, I kept a very similar schedule. I was still there when my nephew was born, I was there for birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, etc. I'm not saying I made every single one, I missed Thanksgiving one year because I did work the night before and would be working the next night but i made what I knew would be feasible. With a freelance schedule it seems like you can adjust your work time to what you need it to be.", "YTA. You also don\u2019t have insomnia. You have an unusual sleep schedule.", "YTA. This is a big event in your sister\u2019s life and you need to adjust your schedule to make it work. You accommodate her not the other way around. You\u2019re acting entitled and selfish here.", "YTA - Stop making excuses for your choices. I know first hand that your condition is treatable. I know for a fact that even though your tired you can still get on with it. Part of insomnia is just being tired all the time anyways.", "YTA\nI have insomnia too guess what i got medications so that i could fall asleep at a normal time and not be an almighty bitch to everyone around me like you are.\nIf you have insomnia you should very well be able to deal with one day with subpar sleep, like do you not do anything in your life?? You think it\u2019s acceptable to just wake up at 2pm everyday?", "You don't have \"insomnia.\" Based on your times, you are getting a full (albeit a little short) night's sleep.  You just sleep different times than most of the rest of the world. You are essentially working a \"night shift.\"\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that. Plenty of people work night shifts. But you know what? They also suck it up and make whatever arrangements are needed for THEIR SISTER'S WEDDING.\n\nThe world doesn't revolve around you and your self-imposed sleep schedule.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nYou can wake up early and be tired for a day. People who have \"normal\" sleep schedules do this all the time. I just had to drop a friend at the airport at 5am, meaning I had to be up at 3am. I was tired for a day and then got over it.", "How strongly I feel depends on how you react to getting up early. When I was at my worst, my vision got blurry and I could barely walk when I was tired, so I wouldn\u2019t blame you for not going in that state.

Also if you're a Bridesmaid that's plenty more hours before 10 that you'll be awake for. \n\nAll these people saying to see a doctor about the day or just be tired are frankly putting a wedding before your wellbeing.

The research and treatment is unfortunately decades behind other medical problems but there is some stuff out there.", "Have you tried using melatonin? Not sure what country you're in and the rules around it. I'm in Australia and it's prescribed but many people buy it online.

OP can be tired for one day to support her sister's wedding.", "Why have you never seen a doctor for this? \n\nBottom line, this is an extremely important day for your sister. If you care about that and your relationship with her, you need to find a way to attend the entire time.  Talk to a doctor and see what can be done. Even if you adjust your schedule by a few hours and sleep by 3 you should be able to power through ONE DAY on adrenaline and perhaps some caffeine. At least show her that you're willing to try. You can't take back the laugh and your unfortunate response in the moment, which was insensitive and self centered, so if you want to repair this relationship with your sister you need to apologize AND put in some effort.\n\nBut seriously- also do this for yourself too. Living a life on the exact opposite schedule of 99% of the world around you is going to prevent you from experiencing a lot.", "What does being bullied in hs have to do with your sister's wedding?\n\nTaking classes and working are daily occurrences so it makes sense to adjust your schedule to accommodate your sleep habits.

Be tired for a day!", "Hey OP, I have no advice on your situation other than to tell you you should get your cortisol levels tested. It's a really simple test, but it could explain why your body reverses days and nights, and its really easy to control with medication. It could be a game-changer if that's what's causing your sleep issues.", ">The thing is that I just can't think when I'm so tired in the mornings\n\nWell, I've got some good news for you then:\n\n1. She said skipping brunch was fine, she just wanted you at the ceremony (not in the morning).\n2.

I had a screwed up schedule until mid-twenties. I  made it work for me. I'd teach the 5-8, 8-11 pm classes, grab a midnight lunch, work in my lab until the cleaners came in at 5 and appreciate that I could use all the equipment without having to schedule or wait on it, chat with the handful of other building night owls, go home around dawn, eat supper, and get about 8-9 hours of sleep, wake up, and repeat. Sometimes I had to proctor tests at 9 am, or noon, or early afternoon. Guess what? I DID IT. And THAT is nothing like as important as a wedding.", "You don't have insomnia.

When I have really important things to do/attend when i\u2019m in one of my really bad lack of sleep episodes is happening, a day or two before the event is when I pull the all nighter (during the day realistically) so I crash early that night. That usually helps me for a few days after, and since it\u2019s before the event you won\u2019t be as much of a zombie during it. I\u2019m not sure if you take sleep meds, but that can be really helpful too. instead of trying to go to bed at like 10-11 right away, you can also just try to do it half and hour to an hour each night", "Love this! Good luck. And don't struggle alone with the sleep challenges- get help and support.", "I mean in the very specific situation you describe, sure. Most weddings are later in the day for a lot of good reasons.", "Right! My dentist is super over-scheduled, like next available is in May. I missed my cleaning in September because I had the plague.

We don't do rehearsal dinners either.", "They don't work for everyone sadly, I have bad insomnia and there's only one type of pill that actually works, the rest do nothing. The one that does they won't prescribe long term so it's only a temp solution, and my doctors at least once you've had it once they won't prescribe it again. Not disagreeing that op is the AH though, when it's a part of your life you accept that sometimes you suck it up and are tired during an event!", "To be perfectly fair, given OP\u2019s age, doctors are usually pretty avoidant of prescribing sleeping pills especially to someone young. I say this as someone who\u2019s had insomnia since they were a young teen. That being said there are lots of things that OP can do.", "Totally agree, or that parents wouldn't have sought treatment at a much younger age. As others have noted, this isn't even insomnia, its a sleep schedule and behavioral disorder. And OP is too old to think it's insomnia at this point.", "Sleeping pills tend to be pretty serious medications with a lot of side effects that don't get prescribed lightly. \n\nI have a sleep disorder and see a sleep specialist and let me tell you I have honestly given up hope on getting regular healthy sleep.

Pills aren't always a perfect solution. \n\n(Please note I am NOT agreeing with OP's point of view at all; I just want to point out that prescription sleep medicine is NOT a solution for everyone and it's not a personal failing when popping a pill doesn't work)", "They found a way to make life work for them without medication.\n\nI applaud that.
