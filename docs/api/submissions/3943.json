My mom wants me to change my RSVP but honestly the wedding isn't going to be possible for me to attend and based on how my sister is acting I don't want to go anymore.\n\nEver since I hit puberty I've had really really (really really really) bad insomnia. I usually go to bed around 6am, 7am, and wake up around 1pm, 2pm. I've tried to change my sleep style and I just can't, it's like dealing with international jet lag. Hanna knows this, but always \"forgets\" and tries to wake me up for family things whenever she visits home and I have to lock my bedroom door and really work to keep her out.\n\nWhen I got the invitation for Hanna's wedding I was super excited for her, because she has always wanted a big wedding, and it looks like she is going to get it, and that might not be what I want/would want, but she does and that is exciting, and I can aknowledge that. But then I saw the timeline and there's a wedding brunch at 10am, the ceremony is at noon, and then there's an afternoon party. I asked Hanna if I could just come to the afternoon party (since I will be sleeping at 10am) and she got furious and started yelling over the phone about how since I'm her sister, I need to be there for the ceremony.\n\nI laughed and told her there was no way I could be there on time, because it would basically be like trying to get someone on a 9-5 work schedule to attend an event at 2am. I probably shouldn't have laughed but it just felt so ridiculous. If she wanted me to be there for the whole thing, she needed to plan for a time when I could actually attend. I work a full time job as a freelancer, just not normal hours because of my insomnia, so it really bugs me when people act like my time is worth less than theirs.\n\nBut now wedding preparations are happening at the house (the brunch is going to be here) and my mom is really upset with me for not coming to the wedding. She wants me to apologize to Hanna and be one of her bridesmaids. Hanna isn't speaking to me at all but she is speaking to our mom so maybe that is what she also wants, but I just feel like she owes me the apology, not the other way around? But I might be wrong because this is the first big fancy wedding in our family and maybe I need to suck it up because it's a tradition to have a morning breakfast or something.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Okay that was universal, AITA. I will apologize to Hanna and ask if I can still attend the wedding. I think it is probably best if I'm not a bridesmaid but I can still put on a dress and show up even if I am tired. Thank you to everyone that sent in medical tips - I am realizing that I need to get a second opinion that isn't our family doctor, because she is actually kind of dismissive about my sleep issues and I used to like that because she made my mom calm down and she supported me with a doctors note for online high school but some of you mentioned high blood pressure and delayed sleep phase disorder and I want to talk to someone who is at least willing to investigate that with me.\n\nEDIT 2: Sorry I meant \"I am the Asshole\" is universal and I get it", "created_utc": 1670173902, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcf9fk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_26f_sisters_29f/", "score": 2370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not like waking up at 2 for a flight and getting a cup of coffee, they\u2019ve talked about how they literally can\u2019t drive or do basic tasks during their sleep time.

Are they needing to travel the same day as the wedding or something? Why is it so early? \n\nAlso repeating what others have said about seeing a doctor. Maybe have a sleep study done.

There's going to be more weddings, events, anniversaries, births, deaths etc. And they're not going to comform to your schedule. \n\nI know it'll probably suck for a day but Right now what it looks like to your sister is that you're choosing a day of being tired over one of the most important days of her life. It'll look like you just don't care enough about her.\n\nI don't understand some of these comments, your sister isn't the asshole. She planned a wedding at the time most weddings happen, when most people are awake and available and you laughed at her and demanded she change it for you? \n\nApologise, do everything you can to be there because you will regret it if you don't.

Why not try skipping your sleep one day and fight it until the evening to see if it helps. You have time to experiment beforehand to try and reset your circadian rhythm.

I and MANY coworkers have suffered from night-shift syndrome at various points. which is a diagnosed, debilitating condition that impacts your quality of life.\n\nYou don\u2019t have that or a medical condition of any kind.

Sometimes it involves pulling an almost all-nighter. For example, in your case after I wake up at 9P for work Friday, I would have to go straight to the wedding from work. Then take off Saturday night or alternately take off Friday, do a light turnaround Thursday into Friday, and get up right before the wedding or get a light sleep around 3A-8:30A before the 10A events \n\nI am not a superhero. I really like my job so I willingly and gladly make the sacrifice because loving my job makes life easy. If I can do it\u2026 you can definitely do it. \n\nPS\u2026.

Sounds like you have other reasons for not wanting to go. If I was your sister and this was the excuse you gave me for not going, I'd be pissed too. It sounds like you don't care about others.

I was leaning to no one was, but you saying she needs to plan things around your schedule... her own wedding, at that, is absolutely ludicrous. Its her wedding. You said you were excited for her, I imagine you would WANT to be there but you've kind of given up on ever addressing your insomnia so you've resigned yourself to missing  this important event. \n\nits absolutely not impossible for you to make it. You take melatonin or something to help go to sleep earlier, you set an alarm on your phone every 2 minutes and put the phone on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed. I used to work overnight in a hotel, I kept a very similar schedule. I was still there when my nephew was born, I was there for birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, etc. I'm not saying I made every single one, I missed Thanksgiving one year because I did work the night before and would be working the next night but i made what I knew would be feasible.

I ended up figuring it out on my own, I still very rarely sleep properly but it\u2019s way better than it was and I\u2019ve figured out what helps and what triggers it to get really bad.", "It's working for OP.\n\nMay not be working for OP's family, but it works for OP.\n\nOP was fine just going to the afternoon but they want more from them than that.", "YTA.

Spent my childhood going to sleep at 2-3 am and getting up at 7. I know how bad that it is. I can tell you, see a sleep specialist. With meds, and a really strict sleep schedule I actually sleep like a normal person now. I go to bed at 9 pm and sleep through almost every night. I still can't sleep without medication, but I am on nonaddictive meds that are usually used for depression or PTSD. Not being exhausted and being able to function with the rest of the world will make you happier.", "I know you already know that you\u2019re the asshole here, but as a person with sleep issues, I just wanted to share a bit of information to see if it can help. \n\nIt sounds like you have Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), not Insomnia. Insomnia is characterised by the inability to fall and stay asleep. DSPS is more like having permanent jet lag, your clock is just off. \n\nAs someone with DSPS (and a family history of it as it\u2019s hereditary), it\u2019s a pain in the ass, but also completely possible to manage and live a normal life with natural day-walkers. It just takes a LOT of will power. It\u2019ll also take a lot of time considering how delayed your cycle is. (I\u2019ll add that I definitely still have nights where I\u2019m just not tired until way too late, and the occasional lie-in is deliciously decadent. It doesn\u2019t \u201cgo away\u201d but it gets easier for sure. I\u2019ll also add, I am not a doctor, but this process was given to me by a doctor when my DSPS was at the absolute worst in 2014.)\n\nIf you want to adjust your cycle, you can do so with \u201clight therapy\u201d (put in quotes because it sounds like you need to buy fancy shit but you really don\u2019t, you can do it all with blue light blocking glasses and natural sunlight, though if you live in an area of the world without natural sunlight at specific times of the year (I mean the Arctic Circle, not Portland, OR), then you may need some other morning light source). The basic idea is to use light to slowly move your sleep cycle backwards.\n\nDetermine a sleep/wake time that is in line with your current cycle, accounting for a slightly shortened night of sleep. You want to put yourself in a slight sleep deficit. For a week, stick to this schedule, using blue light blocking glasses in the 2-3 hours before bedtime (blue light from screens inhibits natural melatonin production in the brain) and going outside and exposing yourself to natural light within 30 minutes of waking up for about 15 minutes. Walking a dog, a walk around the block, even just sitting in front of a window if it\u2019s cold/rainy will do it. It\u2019s okay if it\u2019s overcast. The amount of light outside on an overcast day is still more than most fluorescent light bulbs. The morning light exposure is the most important part of the process. This is what actually adjusts your cycle. \n\nAfter a week, you want to start pushing this cycle back 15 minutes at a time every other day. After 8 days, you\u2019ll have pushed your cycle back an hour. Keep going until you\u2019re at your desired wake up time and then continue to put your bedtime back to get to a full nights sleep and get you out of the deficit. \n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t fool proof and it isn\u2019t permanent (like I said, I still have nights of awful sleep), but it\u2019ll help. Even if it gets you to a point where you can comfortably wake up at 10-11am and waking up a bit earlier to go to your sister\u2019s wedding is just a small nuisance rather than a day of complete exhaustion. \n\nFrom one clinically diagnosed night owl to another, good luck!", "Ok.. let me start by saying.. both parties are aholes.  The sister chose that time not because of tradition,but because it is probably the least expensive option for what she wanted.  If your sister knows you have this insomnia problem, then she should have known that you saying no would be a reality.

They always invite me so I don't ever feel left out, but they will reach out to communicate to me if the event is especially important to them and they want me there. \n \nUnfortunately it seems you don't have a great routine or system of in place  for taking care of the problems you have admitted to being aware of for some time, and now that responsibility has fallen on everyone else. \n\nI hope you get some  help and on the right track managing this,  and I also hope your family is more understanding and kind in the future. Sleep disorders are grossly under diagnosed and no frickin joke.  We require our entire support network to be on board at all times. \n\nI sincerely and wholeheartedly wish you and your family all the best and I hope you guys can all come together after this. \nI really hope this reaches you OP \ud83d\udda4\u2764\ufe0f sending you so so so much love.\n My lil brother's GF  has very severe Insomnia as well, it took her until the past few years to find a routine that works for her.", "YTA\n\nI have always been an insomniac.

Constant mental stimulation, no breaks or else you\u2019ll nap and lose. Also no naps or it\u2019ll get worse. Worst case you just get up early and deal with it for one special day.

There isn't a lot that can be done immediately but with very very small changes, you can usually get an extra couple of hours at a more normal time.

You'll likely need to complete a sleep study and then follow all suggestions and recommendations... Try everything until you find the right approach. \n\nHowever, YTA...

It felt like insomnia because just as I started to fall asleep, when my throat relaxed, I would start to have trouble breathing and would immediately fully wake up. It happened so fast that I didn't even realize I had started to fall asleep. And this was happening 50 times an hour. Considering there's only 60 minutes in an hour, you can see how little sleep I was getting. Out of an 8 hour sleep study, I only got 2 hours and 15 minutes of sleep, and that was mostly stage 1 and stage 2. Stage 1 is where you're just starting to fall asleep but are still aware of things going on around you. And stage 2 is very light where you're easily awoken. I got a grand total of 9 minutes of REM, and that was broken up to a minute here and a minute there. So NOT refreshing sleep. So this all felt like insomnia to me, but wasn't.

The NHS trial people on this, they make you fight for it, they make you jump through hoops and hoops and if it doesn't work well they take it away so who knows how many people it would actually work for if they got to give it a go.\n\nDon't poo poo this.
