(More in background below.)\n\nRecently all the senior women were been asked to participate in a Women's Mentorship Program. The program coordinator is in HR, and knows the story with Lucy. I made it clear to her that I would be happy to mentor one of the many other junior women, but not Lucy. The Mentor/Mentee pairs were announced this week (timed for Women's Day), and I was paired with Lucy. I immediately reminded Coordinator that Lucy was not an option, but apparently Lucy requested me specifically. I don't know what her game is, but I was very clear that either they found her another Mentor, or I would withdraw from the program. \n\nI am being subjected to a pretty hard press to just \"get over it\", and \"be the bigger person\". I strongly believe I am right, but the number of people who are telling me IATA at work, people I respect in general, is making me question my sanity. We are expected to have monthly mentoring sessions for a whole year with our Mentees. I just can't do it, my head has been spinning since Wednesday. I've been given the weekend to \"think about it\". \n\n**Background**: More than a decade ago, I worked for a small company that was very dysfunctional and toxic, where I met Lucy. She had worked at ToxicCo a while, and the day I walked in the door she subjected me to vicious sustained harassment and bullying. Lucy was not the only toxic person, and I was not the only person Lucy treated badly. In the 6 months I worked there, 4 staff left because of her bullying, 2 of those threatening to sue. \n\nBefore she came to NewCo, the last time I saw Lucy was in the ToxicCo President's office when I came into shaking to tell President that another staff member had threatened to \"f\\*ck me up\\* with a wrench. Lucy laughed and told me I probably deserved it, and she'd been tempted to do the same. I walked out of that office and never went back. \n\nThe situation really rocked my sense of self, I would have said previously I was strong and confident and could not be bullied, and ToxicCo, with Lucy in particular, proved me wrong.\n\n2 years ago  Lucy started at NewCo, in another department. I thought I was over it, but experienced pretty close to a full on panic attack when I heard. I wrote up my concerns, particularly about her treatment of her staff, and brought them to her new boss and HR. They agreed to watch her carefully. She is a level below me, her boss and I are close, boss knows the story, but I have been very careful not to share it widely. Lucy and I have never had a conversation about ToxicCo or the bullying since she started at NewCo. No idea why she would ask for me specifically. \n\nIs going out of my way to mentor my bully a reasonable thing to ask of me?

Turn the tables and don't let on get away with it. Be the victim you are and complain loads and above all don't loose sleep over it. Its time to pour out your story and get HR to intervene. What they are asking you to do is insane and I am sure you can use justifications around mental health to make your case.", "NTA what possible reason would Lucy have for specifically requesting you other than to continue her torment? Did you explain to HR about her bullying you?  If you did, do they have that hard of a time connecting the dots as to why she asked for you?  \n\nIf the change is not made I would not continue in the mentoring program submitting your reasons in writing as a matter of record.

Seriously this is f\u2019d up. You should NOT have to leave the program, they need to fix their mistakes.", "NTA Lucy can bug off", "NTA.  So obviously this is an attempt for Lucy to bully you AGAIN, since she specifically requested you and you specifically requested to be a mentor but not her mentor.  Do not do it.  You outlined your participation request in writing and it was denied.  There is no reason for you to be the bigger person.  Three years in the program, perhaps it is time to step aside and allow someone else to do it.  Please report what happens on Monday.", "NTA. \n\nAnd the HR department sucks!!\n\n\nIf it affects your wellbeing, how can they expect that proper mentoring will happen in the first place??

Copy HR on that email.  Put in writing that you feel pressured and are not comfortable with the feeling that there will be repercussions if you refuse and this is creating a hostile work environment.\n\nI\u2019m surprised that HR is good with this so far. Put an undeniable paper trail on this and see how they react.", "NTA. \n\nYou are doing your company and the program coordinator a *favor* by agreeing to mentor someone. Lucy, in getting mentored, is having a favor done for her. Your request to not mentor her > her request to have you as her mentor. Additionally, an employee requesting not to mentor a person who previously bullied them > an employee's request to have that specific person as a mentor just because they want to. The program coordinator should have just told Lucy \"we can't guarantee a specific person as your mentor\" and fulfilled your very reasonable request to mentor *literally anyone else , as you told her when you agreed to do it.* \n\nAlso if she is in HR she must be terrible at her job--from both a protecting employees and protecting the company standpoint, what the hell is she on pairing you with someone you specifically requested not to be with when you are VOLUNTEERING, and with someone who once told you you probably deserved to be physically assaulted with a weapon in the workplace? \n\nI'd go to the program coordinator's boss in HR and Lucy's boss. Absolutely do not mentor her.

For heaven's sake, she *THREATENED* you by saying she'd thought of beating you with a wrench at her last job! And you quit to protect yourself! \n\nIf you have been masking her real actions behind the nonspecific word \"bully\" at your current job (which means different things to different people, and clearly doesn't mean much to your HR) you need to go back to them and TELL THEM what she has done to you in the past.  \n\nI also think this is one of those times where you just don't go along with this. If mentoring is in your employment performance plan, carefully track other instances of you mentoring colleagues and tracking the success of those efforts to demonstrate that you are mentoring people, but you were clear with HR that you will not be alone with this woman because threatened your safety at your last job and you see her insistence that she be assigned to you is a continuation of that threatening behavior. \n\nPlan B if you can't get out of this: Always require a witness be present or on the line when you meet with her or talk to her on the phone.\n\nNTA, bur considering summoning a little AH in yourself to just refuse to participate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would chat with your own boss and make sure they have your back, and I would then withdraw from the company mentoring program via email.  Don't leave the door open to working with other mentees in this program -- HR has proven themselves incompetent, and you can do mentoring without their help.  IDK who is in charge of this program, but if they're not hearing your concerns, I'd seriously debate talking with their manager, since you're in a senior role yourself.\n\nDisrespecting the boundaries placed by women is an interesting take on how to go about organizing a mentorship program for women.  Don't make your decision to withdraw about how awful Lucy was years ago.  Make it about HR disrespecting your clear boundary.  \n\nIf Lucy requested you she's clearly also still a problem, but what happened in the past will feel very she said/she said to current coworkers.  Focus on the HR person who assigned this pairing being bad at their job, because they are, and you being unwilling to work with a voluntary program that's unwilling to respect your boundaries.", "NTA.

Why are they prioritising her needs at the risk of creating a hostile workplace for you when they have so many other options? And copy in Head of HR.\n\nIf no luck, do it, document every negative interaction and send to email so time stamped and don't respond negatively to anything Lucy says. Have meetings where you can be observed or ask to record them to help you later. Then if she does raise a grievance, it is all on record as to what and when happened.", "> A mentor should give hard feedback to the mentee and it sounds like Lucy has some hard feedback coming.\n\nThat might be productive but I would make absolutely sure to never be alone with her and always have a legally permitted hidden camera running. I would assume it highly likely that Lucy has not reformed and is trying to force OP into a compromising position or force her out. \n\nOP, it is up to you and there is no reason that you have to deal with Lucy. If someone else is assigned to mentor her and you trust them to use the information appropriately, perhaps warn them so they know to protect themselves.", "Also the persons in the HR department here are completely unsuitable for this role", "I will take something to HR more formally on Monday, I'm hoping this exercise will help me figure out what to say. \n\nI really don't want to look for a new job though. I love NewCo, they love me. I've been given great assignments, been promoted once, and am in an executive-track program, with extra coaching and development. Only a handful of us are in this program. \n\nThis is my biggest issue, is that I want to be seen as strong, capable and professional. Hell, I AM strong, capable and professional. I really don't want to deal with all this.", "I'm just really worried about changing how NewCo peers and executive see me. I've been really successful and I'm well respected. I've delivered under high pressure  previously.  I really don't want anything to change that perception of me, which is maybe what she's trying to do with this action.", "I did explain to HR about the bullying, and reminded them about the report I made previously. The answer was that no one at NewCo has complained about her, so therefore she must have 'reformed'. \n\nI haven't shared the details widely, because I don't think it's appropriate, but I have told other peers that she and I worked together previously, and that her behaviour was very unprofessional. I'm tempted to go scorched earth with the details, but that's not really me, it's not how I want people to see me.\n\nI've done the mentoring program 3 years in a row now, and see a lot of value in it. I want to continue, just not with Lucy.", "I don't care how \"reformed\" they think she is. I'd ask why they dismissed your clear statement of boundaries,  and chose instead to privilege her request? \n\nAsk why they're also now choosing to pressure you into a situation that you specifically stated would make you uncomfortable? \n\nThis is inappropriate. Be sure that you put ALL if that in writing on an email, and cc your boss, and their boss. \n\nGood luck. I don't trust Lucy for a second. If she tries to guilt you and say she's changed, just smile politely (if coldly) and respond that you're glad to hear it. And that, while it doesn't change your firm decision, you wish her well. \n\nAlways remain polite and professional, and don't give them any traction to make you out to be the bad person here.", "Since Lucy has arrived I've been very careful never to have a 1:1 meeting with her. Cameras are probably not OK, but I won't go to meet with her alone. \n\nI'm not tempted to mess with her, that's just not me. It would require too much energy and focus, and I want to give that to my actual work. \n\nThat's an idea about her eventual mentor though. I may share more details with her.", "When they tell you to be the bigger person, ask why the victim has to accommodate their bully. \n\nLucy should be the bigger person and realize that she cannot have you as a mentor.", "With your entry into the executive track program, do you have the additional time to mentor this year?

It doesn't matter whether you have a lawyer. I found out that the word has a magic effect in similar situations.", "You're not being respected *right now*. What do you think the executives could be seeing that they will drop you from the program just because Lucy asked?\n\nI don't think you're really seeing what's happening.\n\nYou are allowing her to dominate you again. It's not right that she's allowed to demand you be her mentor. A junior is allowed to control the program and control what a senior does? You need to have a serious talk with your boss about why this is being allowed to happen. Why she's allowed to single you out, and why they're insisting it happen.\n\nThis is a respect issue and your office is **not** respecting you.", "In my view you can only improve how others view you by stating the issue and admitting to the past and by making your story heard. You have built your worth over the years and the execs would more likely listen to someone they trust and respect compared to someone junior who has a bad past and is most likely trying to get you to look bad. Don't get stressed about this and just be yourself as I am sure your colleagues do see your worth and if you avoid overthinking this, it would ease with your stress. Do reach out if you want to have a chat as you seems pretty stressed about this. Look after yourself and take it easy. You deserve it.", "It shouldn\u2019t change their perspective.  You did everything right.  You politely set boundaries.  They stomped on them.", "Your last paragraph states your reasoning beautifully.   You explained your reasons for not wanting Lucy so I would ask them what her reasons were for requesting you and why her reasons matter more.  Document, document, document!!  No matter what your decision everything going forward should be in writing.", "Absolutely this. You're the senior here, with a proven track record in this program, and you've already made it clear that you have issues with Lucy that preclude you working together. Definitely ask them why Lucy has been prioritized over you in this case, and make it clear that you won't be working with her either way. If you need to, ask them why they think you would work with someone who thought you deserved to be attacked with a wrench (WTAF).", "I feel like she choose you cause she thinks she can bully you into giving her an easy mentorship, that's my take on this at least, NTA either way.", "This is the way", "Just do this.", "That is...a really good point. I pride myself on my professionalism, and try to stay out of game playing, something I thought was valued at NewCo. \n\nI honestly hadn't seen her actions a power play, I was mostly mystified. But maybe I need to be engaging in a more active defense here.", "It's easy to win a game against someone who won't make a move.\n\nThinking yourself \"above\" office politics is a huge mistake. You don't have to revel in it, just don't be a patsy.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter whether *her* choice was intended as a show of power. Your office has given her power over you and your career."]}
