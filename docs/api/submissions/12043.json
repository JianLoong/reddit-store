IDK who is in charge of this program, but if they're not hearing your concerns, I'd seriously debate talking with their manager, since you're in a senior role yourself.\n\nDisrespecting the boundaries placed by women is an interesting take on how to go about organizing a mentorship program for women.  Don't make your decision to withdraw about how awful Lucy was years ago.  Make it about HR disrespecting your clear boundary.  \n\nIf Lucy requested you she's clearly also still a problem, but what happened in the past will feel very she said/she said to current coworkers.

Since I assume you aren't the one spreading it around, the coordinator has some pretty fast explaining to do\n\nDo not in any way seek to justify your actions. With bullies like this I find a one sentence response works \"I informed HR it was not possible for me to mentor Lucy. I fail to understand why we are still having this conversation\" or something like it should be your ONLY response to anyone, even if you have to repeat it 5 times. You can add an icy \"As I said\" at the start on the third repetition.\n\nAs for HR, you need to go in the polite attack. Get the higher ups involved. They have behaved atrociously and they need to be hell accountable for it.\n\nSo not apologise for anything, ever, in this situation.\n\nI would bet a thousand dollars that Lucy hasn't changed. Of course there are complaints. But it seems her best friend is in HR, doesn't it? Hmmmm...", "NTA,\n\nTalk to whoever in HR is a superior to the mentor coordinator. Explain that one of the reasons you left old company was a hostile work environment in a large part due to Lucy. Explain what you have said here and that the mentor coordinator is not taking you seriously and has told you to \"suck it up\".\n\nThen  if they don't agree to change the mentor assignment, I would warn them that you would be documenting the results of your meeting and any interactions you have with Lucy in writing to act as a paper trail for any future legal action, should it prove necessary. \n\nIf you haven't already done so, be specific in your accusations about Lucy's past bullying when talking to the HR manager. I think Lucy has made up some story that makes her look better and you may have been too vague for them to take it seriously. \n\nDoes your state allow recording with one way consent? I would use my cell phone to record and meetings you have with Lucy.\n\nBetween now and any meeting with HR, please review the [EEOC webpage about harassment and a hostile work environment.](https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment)\n\nETA: Is there any chance that Lucy is a chum to the HR coordinator who told you to suck it up? Because IMO that person ought to be fired.\n\nHR often does a crappy job of protecting individual employees but they really don't like the prospect of being accused of creating a hostile work environment and getting sued. By forcing you to work closely with a known tormentor that is exactly what they are setting themselves up for. You need to make sure that they know it.", "NTA. I suspect that the reason everyone else is telling you to get over it is because they don\u2019t want the teams shuffled around and end up with her themselves.", "NTA. Send a written letter to the head of the mentoring program and the HR Director.\n\n\"Unfortunately, [program] has been unwilling to accommodate my terms with respect to the mentorship program; namely that I not be paired with an individual who has harassed me and encouraged my physical harm previously. \n\nAs I am not going to put myself in the position to withstand further abuse, nor do I wish to open up [current company] to legal liability this person could potentially cause, I respectfully withdraw from the program.\"", "NTA-- Completely refuse to do the Mentorship Program for this round.\n\nAnd write a letter to your boss and head of HR complaining about this process. You told the Coordinator your sole restriction and they ignored it. And their actions resulted in other people in the program pressuring you, creating a negative work environment. \n\nThis Coordinator has put you in a horrible position. Either your reputation takes a hit for refusing to mentor Lucy or you disclose your reason, which hurts Lucy's reputation.", "NTA  ... Refuse ... \"I will not subject myself to another opportunity to be bullied and harassed. Her request is irrelevant as YOU knew my boundary and CHOSE to ignore it; doing so honestly is also violating my professional boundary. I raised my concern a 2nd time when i was ignored and you literally told me to \"think about it\" which is insulting and disrespectful, as such I am withdrawing from the program and making a formal complaint\"\n\nThen call corporate HR and do so immediately. Tell then you don't necessarily want a negative mark or corrective action per say; you simply want it recorded that you started your professional boundary and HR ignored your attempt \"to maintain a cohesive and positive work environment for everyone\".\n\nTo prevent their retaliation.", "NTA and you are being set up. Hold your ground and back out of the program if they cannot accommodate the ask.", "NTA - \u2018be the bigger person\u2019 is one the stupidest comments.      \nIdiots say that when they know they have no valid reason to get what they want.      \nWhen they know the other person is in the wrong.     \nWhen they know they won\u2019t be able to get the AH to behave so they try to make the non ah to suck it up.", "Start shouting louder.Us3 whatever you can.They support bullies,they neglect your mental health oner Lucy's. Whatever you can think off.Do not back off.Unfortunalely,a lit of this is power play,and this Lucy seems to like to play dirty.Start fighting back.Hugs", "NTA. **Please take note OP, she is trying to cause you harm in your new workplace.** By requesting to be your mentee, she's attempting to set up scenarios where 1) she can claim that when alone, you bullied her and should either be fired or taken out of positions of authority in your new workplace (to undermine your career) or 2) she can make you look bad by not doing well as a mentee, thereby showing that you have poor leadership/teaching skills or 3) she can get closer to you to mess up your mental health and slyly bully you again. \n\nMy advice (sorry it's long):\n\nStep 1 - Email HR and CC your boss, maybe even your boss's boss, and whoever else is in leadership over the Women's Mentorship Program with a request to meet on Monday to discuss this issue in length, as you are concerned about how a lack of professional consideration from HR will impact the Women's Mentorship Program going forward. Phrase this in terms of looking out for the company's best interests. You are genuinely concerned that they are not pairing mentors and mentees well and that the program will not only suffer for it, but open the doors for a lawsuit when someone is paired to work closely with another employee who has threatened them with physical harm in the past.\n\nStep 2 - Write up recommended work-arounds that show your professionalism in this situation. (i.e. Have a list of other mentors in the program that would be better suited to mentor this woman, because of the department she's in or personality or whatever.)\n\nStep 3 - If HR won't budge in the meeting, begin escalating things. Request that all email correspondence between you and this woman would have to have your boss and HR cc'd on every communication. Then request that your monthly mentoring meetings would have to take place with others present (i.e. boss, HR employee who won't let this go, etc) for the company's and your safety.\n\nStep 4 - **For if they're still not taking your concerns seriously:** Take this weekend to write out as verbatim as possible all threats and bullying behaviors done by this woman at your last job. Bonus if you can get statements from the 4 who left your last workplace because of this and especially the 2 who were close to suing your last company. If this has impacted your health and you're comfortable providing supporting documentation to that degree, then you can include that. **This will be your information of last resort if they won't listen to you.** And someone else said it, but when all else fails say \"lawyer\". It'll get HR to back off faster than anything.\n\nPart of a Women's Mentorship Program in a workforce is to assist women in knowing when they should speak up for themselves, for their safety and job security, even if it's another woman threatening you. This women has bullied you in the past in a professional capacity, and yeah maybe she's turned over a new leaf and gotten better, but you haven't seen any evidence of this. You can state that you believe in redemption and growth overtime, but relationships to facilitate growth cannot be forced, and that is what HR is attempting to do without listening to your list of potential compromises to the detriment of the company, yourself, and the woman in question.", "NTA.\n\nDO NOT BE HER MENTOR. PULL OUT.\n\nTell HR that you have considered their offer and you would keep it strictly professional as in talk to her when your official duties require you to do so. You can also state that you feel that she should have a clean slate and let others mentor her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Stating how you feel in a diplomatic way is ok. Don\u2019t break down and get personal with the past . Just remember HR played you. So there\u2019s something fishy with that situation.\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon\u2019t mention what your complaints about her again to any of your colleagues, her boss included. Do not speak of her to her boss again unless asked (but give diplomatic answers), no matter how close you are  because what you reported, Lucy or someone can use it to flip on you.\n\nKeep a polite distance from her.\n\nIf she approaches you, make a polite excuse to get away. At all times, be firm and polite.\n\nIf she greets you, greet her back and distance yourself.\n\nDo not talk to her unless it concerns work and always make sure that someone has your back when you speak to her.\n\nI\u2019ve been played out once by a former colleague in a new place although my situation wasn\u2019t so severe, and good people backed me up. I might sound paranoid but those were the steps I took. I was never impolite to the former colleague and I answered her in a very professional way, sticking to work related issues (like sorting out financials without pulling in names of other colleagues in the conversation ),and nothing more.", "I'm sure someone in HR is one of those idiots who thinks that the only thing people who don't get along well need to overcome their differences is by making them work together to \"work it out\".", ">Are you using the word \"bully\" with HR? For heaven's sake, she   \n>  \n>THREATENED  \n>  \n> you by saying she'd thought of beating you with a wrench at her last job! And you quit to protect yourself!\n\nNot specifically, I reminded the coordinator and the HR manager of the Lucy's specific actions I had documented with them, but apparently I'm being too polite. Which honestly is not the first time I've been told that.", "Yes! Bullying sounds like maybe you just don't get along, which is why they want OP to be the bigger person and all that jazz  But Lucy did way more than that!", "Lucy has not apologized, we have not spoken about that time. I did get a lawyer then, and as part of the settlement ToxicCo agreed to the facts of my statement, I could potentially reach out to that lawyer again. \n\nI'm realizing now that the others in the women's group sponsoring the program (outside the coordinator) have not been given my reasons for not wanting to mentor Lucy. Some of those participants, as well as others in her department, are the ones pressuring me to agree to mentor her. I suspect all they know is that I don't like her for unspecified reasons. HR meanwhile is using the fact that no one has made a complaint about her at NewCo as evidence that she has changed. She may have, I honestly don't care.", "Yes, the she said/she said debate is what I've been hoping to avoid. Mind you, the facts in question are not in dispute. ToxicCo agreed to them as part of my settlement with them. \n\nI agree that disrespecting the boundaries of women doesn't seem to be in the spirit of what they say they want to achieve. That's a good angle, thank you.", "I got help in the aftermath of the ToxicCo debacle, but my partner agrees with you and some other commenters that I am clearly not finished dealing with it.", "I'm realizing that allowing her to control the narrative was not a good idea. I think HR really doesn't want a mess on their hands, and they are hoping I will just go along. \n\nI can't transfer, I could almost certainly get as good a job elsewhere, but as I've stated elsewhere I really love my team and the work I'm doing. I also don't want to let her push me out.", "Actually no, I got a feeling something is fishy with HR.\n\nThere\u2019s a possibility that her old bully could have said something.   \nI had been in that situation before.", "You show how strong you are by calmly reiterating your refusal. \u201cAs I told you, I am happy to mentor anyone but this person. It is bizarre that she asked for me. Please assign me to mentor someone else.\u201d If they won\u2019t, just withdraw. Calmly. Do not allow yourself to be bullied, which is what is what seems to be happening. Don\u2019t discuss. There is nothing to discuss. This is a volunteer program. You are free to withdraw. Good luck. You can do this. NTA.", "\u201cIn the past, Lucy has approved of threats of physical violence against me.\u201d\n\nThat should end it.", "Maybe it will change how they see Lucy.", "I don't see the value in giving all the details. You've already explained a lot more than necessary. Any more will seem like you are trying to convince them to see your point of view, and this will be perceived as a weakness/personality conflict. Do not engage in a lot of talks or explaining to those who are telling you to buck up. Stay in your own power and reiterate the boundary. If not respected, withdraw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEditing to add that I agree with the advice to ask them what her reasons were for requesting you and why her reasons matter more. This puts them on the defensive instead of you being on the defensive trying to explain yourself. \n\nAfter that, no more engaging to explain yourself.", "I\u2019d be asking HR why they thought it was appropriate and not a legal liability to prioritize someone with a history of harassment and threats of violence\u2019s request to be paired with someone they have previously harassed and threatened, instead of prioritizing the safety and non-hostile work environment of another employee.\n\nEven if you drop out of the mentorship program, whoever thought that was appropriate needs some serious retraining.", "Even if you do not want to leave, sometimes it is necessary to let your employer know it is a possibility. They think you will roll over, that it will be easier to appease her and you will sit back and take it. You say you have a fantastic track record with your company - companies take care of their rock stars. The fact that they are so obviously favoring her over you tells me that either she is protected by someone in leadership, or that your company does not value your work as much as you think they do. Either way, these are both completely valid reasons to leave. I know you like your job, but if you don\u2019t take a stand here then you will continue to be overlooked and under prioritized. Your company thinks you are someone who can be pushed around and believe that you will tolerate mistreatment by not leaving. As long as they believe there is no danger of losing you, you will continue to be the lowest priority. And honestly, reading your comments, they are right. You are not okay with the situation but keep looking for solutions other than the only real leverage you have, which is leaving. You have tried everything short of threatening to leave, now it is time to play hard ball. Talk to your direct boss. Do not involve HR in the conversation, they are not on your side. Tell your boss you love your job and coworkers, but do not foresee yourself being able to stay in a role where you are forced into a hostile work environment. If your boss values you as much as you say, they will go to bat for you with HR and leadership to keep you. If they don\u2019t go to bat for you, then you seriously overestimated how much they value you and are better off looking for a better opportunity either way", "This whole thing really doesn't make sense.  Changing mentor pairs at the beginning of a program should be so simple.  Why is it so important to whoever is running the program that OP *has* to be with Lucy?  There has to be something more going on here.  Either Lucy has a really close relationship with someone high up enough that her opinion is being given *way* more weight than it should be or someone at the company wants to slow down OP's trajectory in the company or harm her reputation and this was a way to do it.", "ToxicDisabler"]}
