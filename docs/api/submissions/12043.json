In the 6 months I worked there, 4 staff left because of her bullying, 2 of those threatening to sue. \n\nBefore she came to NewCo, the last time I saw Lucy was in the ToxicCo President's office when I came into shaking to tell President that another staff member had threatened to \"f\\*ck me up\\* with a wrench.

I walked out of that office and never went back. \n\nThe situation really rocked my sense of self, I would have said previously I was strong and confident and could not be bullied, and ToxicCo, with Lucy in particular, proved me wrong.\n\n2 years ago  Lucy started at NewCo, in another department. I thought I was over it, but experienced pretty close to a full on panic attack when I heard. I wrote up my concerns, particularly about her treatment of her staff, and brought them to her new boss and HR. They agreed to watch her carefully. She is a level below me, her boss and I are close, boss knows the story, but I have been very careful not to share it widely.

IDK who is in charge of this program, but if they're not hearing your concerns, I'd seriously debate talking with their manager, since you're in a senior role yourself.\n\nDisrespecting the boundaries placed by women is an interesting take on how to go about organizing a mentorship program for women.  Don't make your decision to withdraw about how awful Lucy was years ago.  Make it about HR disrespecting your clear boundary.  \n\nIf Lucy requested you she's clearly also still a problem, but what happened in the past will feel very she said/she said to current coworkers.

With bullies like this I find a one sentence response works \"I informed HR it was not possible for me to mentor Lucy. I fail to understand why we are still having this conversation\" or something like it should be your ONLY response to anyone, even if you have to repeat it 5 times. You can add an icy \"As I said\" at the start on the third repetition.\n\nAs for HR, you need to go in the polite attack. Get the higher ups involved. They have behaved atrociously and they need to be hell accountable for it.\n\nSo not apologise for anything, ever, in this situation.\n\nI would bet a thousand dollars that Lucy hasn't changed.

Because IMO that person ought to be fired.\n\nHR often does a crappy job of protecting individual employees but they really don't like the prospect of being accused of creating a hostile work environment and getting sued.

Phrase this in terms of looking out for the company's best interests. You are genuinely concerned that they are not pairing mentors and mentees well and that the program will not only suffer for it, but open the doors for a lawsuit when someone is paired to work closely with another employee who has threatened them with physical harm in the past.\n\nStep 2 - Write up recommended work-arounds that show your professionalism in this situation. (i.e. Have a list of other mentors in the program that would be better suited to mentor this woman, because of the department she's in or personality or whatever.)\n\nStep 3 - If HR won't budge in the meeting, begin escalating things. Request that all email correspondence between you and this woman would have to have your boss and HR cc'd on every communication. Then request that your monthly mentoring meetings would have to take place with others present (i.e. boss, HR employee who won't let this go, etc) for the company's and your safety.\n\nStep 4 - **For if they're still not taking your concerns seriously:** Take this weekend to write out as verbatim as possible all threats and bullying behaviors done by this woman at your last job. Bonus if you can get statements from the 4 who left your last workplace because of this and especially the 2 who were close to suing your last company. If this has impacted your health and you're comfortable providing supporting documentation to that degree, then you can include that. **This will be your information of last resort if they won't listen to you.** And someone else said it, but when all else fails say \"lawyer\". It'll get HR to back off faster than anything.\n\nPart of a Women's Mentorship Program in a workforce is to assist women in knowing when they should speak up for themselves, for their safety and job security, even if it's another woman threatening you. This women has bullied you in the past in a professional capacity, and yeah maybe she's turned over a new leaf and gotten better, but you haven't seen any evidence of this.

The fact that they are so obviously favoring her over you tells me that either she is protected by someone in leadership, or that your company does not value your work as much as you think they do.

You know from personal experience what she\u2019s like, and if she went out of her way to request you, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s changed. I don\u2019t believe for a second that she chose u because she wants to apologize. She\u2019s probably going to try to make you look bad, so do whatever you have to do to avoid mentoring her. She doesn\u2019t deserve any of your time, and you deserve to feel and be safe at your place of work. I would email your boss, hers, and HR all together, and remind them of the situation and all of the problems she caused you. I would reiterate that you are enthused to participate in the mentoring program and think it\u2019s a wonderful idea (butter up HR lady) and that you would be more than happy to mentor anyone else. Try not to use any negatives when writing or speaking about it bc people tend to respond better to positive action oriented comments. \n\nSo I\u2019d say something like:\n\u201cDear X, Y, & Z, \nI\u2019m thrilled to be part of the mentorship program and realize how wonderful and beneficial this will be for all employees involved. As you might be aware, I reported issues with a coworker from the past who happens to work here now. She threatened me with physical harm on multiple occasions, and consistently went out of her way to bully me to the point that I had to leave my company and find a new place of work. One where I didn\u2019t have to fear for my physical safety. As I mentioned, I\u2019m thrilled to be involved in the mentorship program, and believe I have a lot of experience to share with my mentee. However, for me to mentor most effectively, I am letting you know that I will not be able to take Lucy on for any amount of time, as I\u2019m not willing to be put back in a similar position. There are many other mentors who would suit her well; and given her history of harassment & unprofessionalism towards me, I strongly believe working together would do us both a major disservice. It is everyone\u2019s right to be safe and secure from threats of bodily harm, and mentoring Lucy will surely be a threat to me. When I signed on to be a mentor in this program, I did so with the stated condition that I would not work with Lucy. It is a cause of great concern that this serious matter isn\u2019t being taken as seriously as it needs to be, especially considering that I\u2019ve diligently notified you of this at every relevant turn. I\u2019ve never had any issues with any other coworker at any time, and after years at this company, I trust that you will make the right call and rectify this issue. Please let me know who you will re-assign me to, otherwise feel free to remove me from the mentorship program.\u201d\n\nI hope some of what I wrote is helpful to you, but I would also really suggest getting out of there and finding a better position somewhere else. This place sounds pretty toxic as well. They\u2019re telling you to \u201cget over it\u201d and \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d which is just bizarre considering threats of harm and bullying to the point of panic attacks isn\u2019t something you should ever just glaze over and \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d about. Idk if you have any documentation from the incidents at the last job saved somewhere, but if you do, I\u2019d highly recommend breaking those bad boys out and attaching them to the email. If you are ever forced to be around her, I\u2019d at the very least, record the convo on your phone and save it. I know you said you didn\u2019t think you could use cameras, but if no one is going to protect you, you\u2019re going to have to do it yourself and you need to make sure you have solid proof of what she\u2019s doing so they can\u2019t gaslight you to get over it anymore. And never under any circumstance, should you be alone with her. These people need to know that this is a consistent pattern with her over years, and I would definitely speak to her eventual mentor and let them in on what kind of person she is. \n\nOut of curiosity, do you live in a small town? Or just work in very similar fields? I just think it\u2019s a little weird that she got a job where you work all of a sudden, after leaving your last job explicitly bc of her heinous behavior. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re experiencing this but hold your ground and don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad about it. This is not something to get over and if they really don\u2019t seem to understand, it\u2019s gonna be time to find a new work place. Preferably one where she can\u2019t just show up and one where they will make sure to keep you safe no questions asked. It exists and you deserve that. Best of luck to you!

No matter what work says.\nThat being said, you always can.  For more money", "NTA. Bullies can be clever and this is a clever way for Lucy to make you look bad and intimidate you. Technically she isn't really \"doing\" anything, so she knows other people will not view your unwillingness as not reasonable. \n\nIf you're going to fight back you have to be equally clever. That means get it in writing from your HR/bosses that this is a requirement of your job despite your wishes and despite informing them that Lucky has harassed you in the past. Once its in writing and they're names are signed on it, go mentor Lucy. Be nice, give her a chance. If Lucy does nothing bad, then that's a win, right? No problem. If Lucy starts to harass you again, take notes, record all examples.\n\nThen takes that to your HR/bosses boss and show them  that not only is Lucy harrassing you, but your HR/boss knew it was an issue and still forced you to do i. They are now complicit in the harassment. Once your Bosses job is on the line, he/she will turn against Lucy super fast.", "nta I am worried that  Lucy requested you specifically so she can say *you* are bully her, and will use this as an excuse for any piss poor performance on her part; she'll say it's your fault because you purposely didn't  do your job as her \"mentor\"", "NTA. She wants to manipulate your, your coworkers, or set you up to lose your reputation and be fired. You wouldn\u2019t even make a good mentor to her if you feel resentful and distrustful of her. It interesting that she specifically requested you and paired you over your objections and are refusing to reassign. Protect yourself and don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. Everyone has already explained it well here. Good luck, and know this is not you that is being unreasonable.\n\nI'd go over hr at this point, but also brush up your resume.", "NTA, but I wouldn\u2019t accept the assignment. She\u2019s looking for a way to undermine you, I wouldn\u2019t doubt.", "NTA. It seems like Lucy is trying to find a way to bully you at your new work too and is using your mentorship team in HR. I agree with others on here to email HR (upper level HR too) as a CYA. The email should sound very level headed, succinct and state you should not feel pressured to mentor someone given her past threatening behaviour to you, and especially when you\u2019ve given options to mentor other people. I hope it works out and seriously hate that you have to work with Lucy.", "Just withdraw, like you said you would.\n\nAnd start looking elsewhere", "NTA", "NTA. This letter, I suggest you submit it to Alison Green's blog \"Ask a Manager\" for advice also. If you can't wait, post on Friday morning to get feedback from the group. \n\nIt is completely insane for HR to have someone who implied a physical threat on your life, matched with you as your \"mentee\".\n\nSounds like Lucy wants to continue her bad behavior.  Totally unacceptable.  And now you know the caliber of people you work with, who think that Lucy's physical threat is NBD. \n\nI want to address also something else. You ARE a strong, confident person who could not be bullied. You walked out.  You moved on.   Bullies target competent, well-liked, successful people.  Many, many people get targeted.  I suggest reading Robert I Sutton's book \"The No Asshole Rule\" and anything by Gary Namie to reiterate that this does happen to good, competent people who work hard.  \n\nDon't be afraid to leave NewCo if they are disrespectful. No matter how good the work is, it's nothing if you don't work with people you like and trust. There's plenty of workforce development research to back this up, too. Almost all workers enjoy better mental health in dead-end, lower-paid jobs with people they like, than earning more with tyrants.", "Tell them you don\u2019t need a week. Her request doesn\u2019t get to override your firmly stated boundary which was clear to all parties before the pairings were assigned. The answer is no and unless they want a bigger problem (restraining orders, law suits, etc) you won\u2019t tolerate anybody pressuring or harassing you about it.\n\nStay firm. You have a known history documented regarding your relationship with this woman. You owe her nothing- least of all your mentoring.\n\nNTA", "NTA.   \nYou are well within your rights to want to mentor someone else.   \nI would withdraw from the mentoring program and decline to participate this year.", "NTA Your boundaries should have been respected by HR.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure Lucy has some ugly trick up her sleeve in requesting you. \n\nDon\u2019t give in.

Do all the people giving you a hard time about this know all the gory details? It might be time to go full disclosure so that people can make an informed decision about whether or not they think this is a good idea before they give you bad advice.\n\nMake it clear that this woman not only bullied and harassed you, she made veiled threats of physical violence against you.

The HR lady's disregard for your feelings is concerning. Good luck and please update when you can.", "I disagree, they had their chance and i think this would be a gross underreaction.\n\nI would go as far over HRs head as i could. You made a clear reasoned and reasonable request of them at HR, and they disregarded  you and your position. In fact kind of threw it in your face. They should be writen up, sanctioned or dealt with in some way that shows how unreasonable the position they put you in is. \nFrankly ,someone should loose a job over this. Had she been a man HR would have been too afraid to do this, but your experience has been belittled and dismissed. Frankly , i would go scorched earth, but thats up to you. \n\nWithdraw from the program, and make sure everyone above HR you can reach knows why. \n\nNTA, and good luck", "How do you magically get someone to stop harassing you ?", "Or Lucy is \u201ccharming\u201d and had perfectly reasonable sounding excuses. \n\nHer type always does.", "I\u2019d add \u2018including verbal sexual harassment\u2019 after harassment. Lucy did say she thought OP should be SAd with a wrench, after all.", "Please update this after you escalate it with HR. I am very curious as to what they come back with.

The writer usually has constructive ideas.", "Be \"strong, capable, and professional\" enough to firmly enforce your stated boundaries with your employer, and to know better than to put yourself in a situation like this where the stress and anxiety might negatively affect your work in other areas.

I've trained executives and was one for 30 years. \n\nTell them this isn't about being the bigger person. That she has threatened you with violence in the past, (document this all in an email) and that you want to **avoid opening the company up to any liability** by having a 1-1 relationship especially after having made your concerns known to management and HR.  \"Even if I was open to working with someone who threatened me, I think it would be best for the company if I didn't\"\n\nfor future reference ... ensure that everything you do is in the best interest of the company....you know, be a company woman :-)  That is always your go to...it isn't about you, it is about the company.", "I think you could frame it as you are worried about your safety after all she did said she would wrench you and any sane person would stay away from someone who made that kind of threat.  She could say that was a joke, sure, but who in the right mind would say that to a colleague or subordinate in a work place.   This implies she is mentally unstable and it's not because you can't do your job.  It's because you don't want to ended up in Dateline.\n\nI don't think Lucy has good intentions to be your mentee.  She probably gonna sabtoge you by performing badly because you told her to do it like this and make you look super bad.  I would think setting a boundary now will actually protect you because she might say you didn't put an effort in her due to past grudges.  So, withdrawing is probably better for you in the long run.   Also document every interaction with her from now on.  \n\n\nIf she was this malicious in her 30s, she is gonna be worse in her 40s unless she was struck by lightning and had an epiphany and wanted to be good human being but this is very unlikely.\nSo yeah, watch your 6.
