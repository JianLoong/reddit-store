IDK who is in charge of this program, but if they're not hearing your concerns, I'd seriously debate talking with their manager, since you're in a senior role yourself.\n\nDisrespecting the boundaries placed by women is an interesting take on how to go about organizing a mentorship program for women.  Don't make your decision to withdraw about how awful Lucy was years ago.  Make it about HR disrespecting your clear boundary.  \n\nIf Lucy requested you she's clearly also still a problem, but what happened in the past will feel very she said/she said to current coworkers.

With bullies like this I find a one sentence response works \"I informed HR it was not possible for me to mentor Lucy. I fail to understand why we are still having this conversation\" or something like it should be your ONLY response to anyone, even if you have to repeat it 5 times. You can add an icy \"As I said\" at the start on the third repetition.\n\nAs for HR, you need to go in the polite attack. Get the higher ups involved. They have behaved atrociously and they need to be hell accountable for it.\n\nSo not apologise for anything, ever, in this situation.\n\nI would bet a thousand dollars that Lucy hasn't changed.

Because IMO that person ought to be fired.\n\nHR often does a crappy job of protecting individual employees but they really don't like the prospect of being accused of creating a hostile work environment and getting sued.

Phrase this in terms of looking out for the company's best interests. You are genuinely concerned that they are not pairing mentors and mentees well and that the program will not only suffer for it, but open the doors for a lawsuit when someone is paired to work closely with another employee who has threatened them with physical harm in the past.\n\nStep 2 - Write up recommended work-arounds that show your professionalism in this situation. (i.e. Have a list of other mentors in the program that would be better suited to mentor this woman, because of the department she's in or personality or whatever.)\n\nStep 3 - If HR won't budge in the meeting, begin escalating things. Request that all email correspondence between you and this woman would have to have your boss and HR cc'd on every communication. Then request that your monthly mentoring meetings would have to take place with others present (i.e. boss, HR employee who won't let this go, etc) for the company's and your safety.\n\nStep 4 - **For if they're still not taking your concerns seriously:** Take this weekend to write out as verbatim as possible all threats and bullying behaviors done by this woman at your last job. Bonus if you can get statements from the 4 who left your last workplace because of this and especially the 2 who were close to suing your last company. If this has impacted your health and you're comfortable providing supporting documentation to that degree, then you can include that. **This will be your information of last resort if they won't listen to you.** And someone else said it, but when all else fails say \"lawyer\". It'll get HR to back off faster than anything.\n\nPart of a Women's Mentorship Program in a workforce is to assist women in knowing when they should speak up for themselves, for their safety and job security, even if it's another woman threatening you. This women has bullied you in the past in a professional capacity, and yeah maybe she's turned over a new leaf and gotten better, but you haven't seen any evidence of this.

The fact that they are so obviously favoring her over you tells me that either she is protected by someone in leadership, or that your company does not value your work as much as you think they do.

Her contact information is here: https://www.askamanager.org/follow", "Yeah, I would stop using the word bully and start describing her as \u201csomeone who threatened me with violence in the past\u201d", "I forgot to mention, there are three magic words that makes any HR rep sit up straight in their chair and stop fucking around.\nHostile. Work. Environment.", "Lots of folks are suggesting you mention lawyers, suing, etc but I don't think that's going to make them like you or want to help you. I'd say after giving it more thought this weekend, I realized I wasn't being clear with you about how bad her behavior was in the past, and how harmful it would be for you to force me to mentor her here. Explain her worst offenses in detail at the old place, LEADING with the threat to beat you, even though it happened last chronologically.  State you should not be put together with someone who threatened you with violence in the past.  I hope they come to their senses.", "Absolutely agree it's time to go scorched-earth here. Good luck on Monday.", "Yes. Escalate above the coordinator. It's past time to do so.", "OK, settlement level where your prior employer *agreed with the facts* rather than a squirmy 'we're not saying this is true but we're settling'? It's holy shit time.\n\nContact your lawyer: if *Lucy* was a party in the settlement, *she* may be in violation of the settlement (my assumption is the settlement was with the company, tho- this may be a nonstarter). Your lawyer can advise you what you can and cannot say to your new employer, but some permissible under the bounds of the agreement permuation of \"Lucy's behavior at my prior employer was so egregious that they *agreed with our statement of facts as part of the agreement*.\" should light a serious fire. Have a meeting with your boss and hr coordinator's manager's replacement and lay this shit out for them in whatever terminology your lawyer gives you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now, some personal words. I know this is hard, and retraumatizing. Lucy is *counting* on you not wanting to rock the boat in order to continue to harass you. She 100% asked for you purposefully and maliciously. You have the right to be free from harassment in your workplace. Go on the offensive here and it will not hurt your career. \"Lucy cannot possibly, in any world, think that this would be welcome on my part given I left prior employer where she harassed me to the point I sought legal recourse *and won*. I deeply enjoy working here and see a long, happy, healthy, and productive future for myself as part of X team. X company's faith and trust in me, as shown by the opportunities the company has afforded me to develop on the executive track are not things I take lightly. I would expect the company to respect the incredibly painful position Lucy and, more importantly, HR person has put me in by *not taking this situation seriously despite my best efforts*. My notifications, well-documented, as to the issue should have been enough to keep this from ever happening. and Lucy having another opportunity to harass me.\"", "Sorry I have no empathy for adults who can't stand up for themselves. All I have for them is pity.", "Document everything.", "Please listen to these people.  The fact is you apparently still work for someone that just as much deserves the name ToxicCo as your old job, if someone said \"hey I know this person said you deserved to be physically threatened and they were tempted to assault you to, but could you spend multiple hours around them?\"  would you consider the person asking a decent person to be around or someone you should Absolutely get away from?", "I would escalate, go above the HR lady and to her boss, alert my own boss, and go from there.   \nI would also look into what unions I have available to me as well, just in case it blows up and I need backup for wrongful termination or a toxic workplace (of course this depends on country). \n\nThen, I would update my resume and start looking for other positions elsewhere.", "This doesn\u2019t meet the legal definition of a hostile work environment in the USA (not sure where OP is located). That term only applies to abuse based on a protected class like race, gender, religion, or disability. Otherwise, bosses and co-workers can be as awful to you as they want. It sucks, but it isn\u2019t illegal.", "Management speak them one further.\n\n\"I'm being the bigger person by recognising that Lucy will be better mentored by someone with whom there is no previous associations. This is for the benefit of us both and the company as a whole.\"", "Email this!", "Actually, the fact that the HR person is prioritizing Lucy\u2019s wants above OP\u2019s is suspicious.  Was this HR person involved with originally hiring Lucy?  Could they be friends from before Lucy worked there?  Or have become friends since?  Scour any social media of both of them.  See if they follow each other or have posts that show them together outside of work.", "Good idea, but won't be in time to address this at her workplace on Monday.", "I would formally request documentation on your protest, tell HR that if they are not willing to change assignment and continue to insist on this, then you will go through other channels. If your work speaks for itself and you are valued, have your boss take your side and approach the owner/CEO. Something tells me that Lucy has been playing \"the game\" and getting in the good graces of HR and sweet talking the people you've been talking to about it seeing as they are not taking your side. Your reservations previously were documented and IDGAF if this is some \"reformed\" bullshit, it's likely not. If this doesn't work, then it's time to start looking.", "This is definitely the best course of action. OP doesn\u2019t look weak, but the company knows she means business.", "Disgusting behavior. It isn't for lack of trying, some people will beat you down no matter what. People who have been abused before are far more likely to be victim to it again. This isn't a choice. Get over yourself and your shit \"bootstraps\" mentality. It gets us nowhere. Some people never got taught the skills to handle these situations, and don't have the mental capacity. God forbid somebody have mental illness near you.\n\nYou may end up in an old folks home someday, maybe a shitty one with abusive staff. Hope you think of this conversation then when you can't help yourself. I'll pity you.", "This is not correct.  Hostile work environment does not depend on being a protected class.  There are additional avenues for recourse if you are a protected class, but that has more to do with discrimination than hostile work environment.", "That may be, but it's a good brushback pitch, so to speak. Some places don't like to have to loop the lawyers in because it costs money. At the very least it should pause things and likely buy OP some time. And also signal that OP is not playing around.", "Further, if OP \\*does\\* agree on those terms, then she must state the conversation--with the bully's agreement--must happen that day, in front of two witnesses, who must both document that they saw it and all parties involved agreed. The witnesses can be members of HR, since they've already been alerted, which would protect both OP's and bully's reputation. But frankly, since OP just doesn't want to, she shouldn't. This is the 'refusing would hurt my career' option.", "OP is exhibiting signs of PTSD due to her treatment from Lucy.

Always. No ifs or buts. No matter the level of trust.", "\"To clarify, I will have no involvement at any time with Lucy. Not wanting to ruins someone else's career I appear to have understated my position. While I was working with her, when I complained that I was threatened with physical violence she said I deserved it and and she's thought the same. I will not work with someone who has wished physical violence upon me now or ever. This is final.\"", "How vindictive of you. After reading your messages, it makes sense to me why you reacted the way you did. You are a bully yourself and bullies hate when you stand up to them.", "I'm simply turning your logic back upon you. I truly don't wish that on folks, but I want you to think about how your rhetoric stated is harmful. I said it because I want you to think about the impact. What I said hurt, no? You reacted strongly, rightfully so. This is what your rhetoric leads to.\n\nBut nice try turning it around on me, you obviously are the bully type since you commented on the post of a distressed woman just to call her pathetic. How pathetic of you is that? It's truly an awful thing to do to somebody who is hurting.\n\nPlease take what I've said and ruminate on it. You really need to rethink your way of thinking, because not everybody can be \"strong\" like you. People have different life experiences and mental illnesses and neurodivergence. \n\nIt's unlikely that you are a bad person, but what you said really hurts people who are already in pain. Please reconsider."]}
