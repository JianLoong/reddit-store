Good for you for your weight loss progress so far!! As someone who has also lost a lot of weight, people are unfortunately going to have SO MUCH commentary regarding what you\u2019re eating, exercise, etc. There\u2019s a difference between your family privately having conversations with you regarding health concerns with your weight vs publicly shaming you.

I\u2019m a silent attritioner - I might have stayed for dinner, not eaten anything, and never gone back. Kudos to you for leaving that terrible environment. You don\u2019t need to apologize - you deserve the apology. And even then, I\u2019d think very strongly about Christmas.", "NTA.  \nFirst, congrats on your progress!!

It\u2019s perfectly ok to have a treat while trying to get healthy. \n\nYour parents are well out of order. That is not the way to support you.

There is no shaming out of \"love.\" They don't know better about your own body than you, and a hershey kiss isn't going to literally anything to your body or your weight loss plan. \n\nThey were rude and even admit they were that way on purpose.

I hope you are proud of yourself and remember to have those cheat meals or a sweet or two to treat yourself. It's so important because if it is all or nothing, you will absolutely fall off the diet because it is so depressing to never indulge at all.", "NTA. Congratulations on your weight loss.  As a doctor, you're doing it in a sustainable way which is far better for you.

You get to tell abusive fuckwads exactly what you think and it reduces future fuckery.

I'm proud of you!", "NTA. Their behavior is not \"for your benefit.\" Things that benefit you are kindness, support and prolly noticing your health improvements.\n\nHeck, a Hershey's kiss is about 25 calories! Geez! I firmly believe it is better to eat one kiss (or cookie, or whatever) rather than deny yourself and then eat 1/2 lb of chocolate at home alone.\n\nYou sound terrific!

I'm not sure what your family's damage is, but these are not nice people. Noone wants to start a family dinner as the target of uncalled for derision.

Who the hell brings wine to someone who is trying to get sober? That's just 9 kinds of mean. I also hate the 'but we're worried so being mean is fine! It's tough love!'. Like...no one has ever overcome anything with that kind of 'excused cruelty'. Ever. Plus I have had a few friends and a sibling deal with eating disorders and it's a miserable existence that I wouldn't wish on anyone. (My brother got hit especially hard by it because so many people don't think men can have disordered eating issues. At least not where we lived at the time.) \n\nBut damn, you're getting sober AND losing  weight! That's incredible! (4 years sober myself) You're doing very difficult work, I know.

Tell them that you have a professional medical team that is working with you and you are following the guidelines and recommendations of PROFESSIONAL people with experience in this matter. Their comments, opinions, suggestions, or whatever need to be kept to themselves full stop. One word about your diet, weight, what you put on your plate/in your mouth, and you will up and leave period. Zero second chances. If they continue to push, and you want to see your family, consider stopping by AFTER food/desert to say hi. You do not have to subject yourself to this type of behavior. Does not matter where they are coming from. You are doing amazing and you have the results to show for it. Continue to do what you are doing with the help of your doctor. Slow and steady will win this for you. Making meaningful changes is the key. Try to not let them get in your head.", "NTA.

They had no right to berate you like they did and if you felt uncomfortable then good on you for removing yourself from the situation. You seem to be doing well, losing 30 lbs in 4 months, keep it up and if they are like this, it makes me wonder if they did this growing up and maybe thats how you ended up overweight to begin with... have they always bullied you like this?", "Definitely NTA. My mother does this to me all the time. I too have lost some weight over the last couple of months, and put my diabetes 2 into remission, but all she does is tell me I still need to lose weight and that I am still diabetic and in danger of losing my sight - tests have proved that to be untrue.\n\nLosing weight is such a hard thing to do - I have an ED - I am an emotional eater and definitely eat my feelings, but when food is your addiction, you cannot just cut it out as we need to eat. I don't understand her attitude - I have lost weight, quit smoking and quit drinking, and yet, because I am still overweight, she somehow seems to think she is just showing her concern for me by commenting on my size.\n\nThis is not about showing how concerned they are for your health, this is about being  bullies who get pleasure out of hurting you.  You did not sour the evening, they did!\n\nMy mother often asks my sister why I never ring her and rarely see her, and when she is told why, she will spend hours showing how she is right and I am just being oversensitive because I don't like to hear the truth.\n\nCongratulations on your weight loss - you are doing so well and I'm sorry your family sucks.", "NTA\n\nHow dare they! You\u2019ve done a bloody excellent job & people shouldn\u2019t comment on others weight regardless of who they are, related or not.  \nIve been the recipient of some \u2019interesting\u2019 behaviour since loosing weight. I had gastric sleeve surgery in April. I\u2019m 54 & due to a complex set of health issues was unable to loose weight without surgery. I\u2019m so glad I did, it\u2019s the best investment I ever made in myself, but peoples reactions are\u2026. Weird?\n\nSome of my family are so invested they ask every single time I see them how much weight I\u2019ve lost and have spoken to me more in the last 6 months than in the last 6 years.

When I was a teen and into my early thirties i was skinny, and sometimes too skinny due to mental health issues. People don\u2019t mind telling you when they think you\u2019re too skinny either.   \nWriting this has made me realise how much emphasis has been put on the way I look not the person I am throughout my life.   \n\n\nPlease continue to be the best you you can be & don\u2019t listen to anyone else.

You are doing brilliantly and just keep on doing what your doing", "NTA. One of the reasons so many people gain all the weight back they lose dieting is following a diet so strict that it is not manageable long term.   Allowing yourself a small treat here and there prevents binging on treats in the long run. In many cases if the original diet is too calorie deficit your metabolism is permanently altered, meaning that if you do have a pit stop along your journey to get to a healthy weight, getting back on track is going to be harder and harder. \n\nYou are taking the approach your doctor recommended, and have amazing results to show for it. Just getting into the non obese category on the BMI scale with statistical significance adds years to the average person life expectancy. Congratulations, you are awesome, keep up the amazing work! \n\nYou owe no one an apology, you are owed one. They are being a crappy support system. You were not shoving a pie in your face, just eating one small treat when presented with the option to gouge at a thanksgiving feast is a victory in itself.", "NTA. Your parents are though. The best and healthiest way to lose weight is going slow and steady, just like you're doing. Drastic weight loss is very bad for you, and you'd just gain it back again after a while.

Good for you for the 30 lb weight loss.  It's not easy to do.  And of course what's easier to do is to tell your mom, step father and sister to keep their opinions to themselves and to mind their own business.  And leave like you did.  No one needs criticizing and judgmental  people in their lives.  Go low contact and good luck to you.", "NTA.\n\nNo one should mention the weight of anyone else unless that conversation is invited by that person.", "First, HECK YES, FRIEND! Congratulations, what you\u2019ve already accomplished is incredible and you should be so proud of yourself!\n\nAnd straight up, NTA. The only reason your sister is getting on your case is because she chose to stay while your parents lamented being treated like the unsupportive lamp-stands they chose to be. Thats on her. And as for them? Pffft. Love never breeds shame, it\u2019s an excuse to be cruel.\n\nYou are never TA for protecting yourself. And the self-respect you showed is also a huge deal. Good for you!\n\nOne more time, congrats on the massive success!!!", "NTA  shaming you like that is horrible, especially during a holiday and after you\u2019ve been working so hard.  Stay strong and keep getting healthier the right way.  You deserve it", "NTA - and fuck them.", "NTA, they are not supporting you in any way.   You owe no one an apology.   Your parents soured the evening.", "NTA and never go back!", "Nta, it's thanksgivings, everyone knows thanksgivings is about the food coma we're about to enter.

Great job on your weight loss. And great job on protecting yourself and removing yourself from a bad situation.", "NTA. I know that most people are no contact, but you really need to ask yourself, what do they add or nourish in your life? Just because they're family doesn't mean you have to set yourself on fire to keep them warm! Do what's best for you, if that means cutting them, and anyone who supports their harmful views, out of your life, so be it. That includes your sister and any family or friends who stand with them!

You\u2019re doing great.", "Congratulations on your progress! As a fellow overweight person I know the struggles of losing and it is incredibly hard.

My mother would then cause a massive scene about how calm she is and how irrational I am.  Just leaving was my best choice.", "Yeah, they love pointing out how worried they are for me because all of the fat on my body is in my belly, around my organs.

My sister is the golden child in the family here.  I was born with autism, so they felt the need to not take what I say seriously and really hammer in what they want me to do with my life.  My mother once even had a restraining order placed against her by my therapist when I was an adult and living alone, just because she did not like how my therapist was encouraging me to change jobs when I was unhappy with the job I had.  I still do not know how she found out which clinic I was going to, and that scares me.", "My mother keeps on telling me she is worried I am diabetic even though I told her my doctor tested for it.  The doctor pulled a whole bunch of tests on me.  My cholesterol is normal.  My blood sugar is normal.  My heart rate is normal.  Everything is working quite well except for the excess weight on my belly.  And then my mother says she is worried because all of my fat is around my organs, and that is extremely unhealthy, and that if I do not get serious about losing weight by doing all of the fad diet shit she pushes on me, that proves to her that I do not want to live.\n\nI wish I was not making this up.", "You might want to switch your N A H TO NTA. I think, if I understand your comment correctly, you think the parents are wrong.", "They are hyper focused on the fact that I still have a beer belly.  It has been shrinking, but they claim I still have a very long way to go.  And my mother telling me that if I really wanted to lose weight, I would keep myself under 1000 calories a day - that helped convince me that I am not dealing with reasonable people here.", "Well, my mother did once have a hissy fit when I told her she could not bring wine to my house after I just joined AA a couple of months earlier, so I doubt I am dealing with reasonable people.  Still, the rest of the family wanted to spend time with me.", "Yeah, I pretty much had no appetite for dinner after I got home from that.

Good on you, for listening to your doctor instead of this nonsense. I\u2019ve been working on my own slow but healthy weight loss and I\u2019ve had to listen to my mom encourage me to take these \u201cvery safe\u201d weight loss gummies that will make me lose 40 pounds in a month. My mom has always been obsessed with weight loss gimmicks instead of a healthy diet and exercise. I tried to explain that these trends are why she can never keep the weight off but she won\u2019t hear of it. \n\nYou are definitely NTA for both sticking up for yourself and leaving someplace you were no longer comfortable.", "Good for you, for sticking to the advice of your doctor.", "No one should have under 1000 calories ever to lose weight.

Both my sister and I have told her repeatedly to stop mentioning my weight, but I personally feel that she delights in tormenting me. TBH, I would prefer to go NC with her, but my kids love her, so involve her in their lives, but I spent most of last Christmas in tears with the abuse I got, and this year, we are having Christmas with my daughters in their place, so I have said my mother can stay with my elder daughter in the larger house where all the celebrations will take place, and I will stay in my younger daughter's flat, so at least I can get some reprieve from her.\n\nAs a mother, I cannot imagine ever hurting my children the way she hurts me, and I do not understand how she doesn't see what she is doing to me - she is an intelligent woman.

Meanwhile my partner who is in her 40s and myself in my 30s are scraping the bottom of the barrell, both working 3 jobs, and both making over 26$/hr because where we love the cost of living is simply too much, and we're desperately trying to hold on to our condo because the housing crisis is REAL bad.\n\nIt all started because my partner mentioned the fact our strata issued a special levy for fixing the not up to code balconies, so we had to make an extra 13k this year somehow to pay for it. The new wife unhelpfully suggested we remortgage the place. Which requires getting approved for a mortgage. We don't meet the requirements for this with how bad the market has gotten. We told her as much, and cue the \"just work harder\", \"you'll get there\", \"just find a job that pays more\".\n\nLong story short, the privilege and generation gap was WILD, and his wife even said \"I think you're perceiving a different reality\". Yunno. Saying I'm imagining things because that isn't her experience. Classy.\n\nAnyways, we looked up the bus schedule. There was one in 20 mins. We got up and left and thanked them for dinner. \n\nMy partner is still fuming over it, and it was that straw that broke the camel's back as far as her dad is concerned. Years of not taking an genuine interest in her, not listening to her, not even remembering basic things like allergies and calling her a picky eater that just needs to \"expand her culinary tastes\".\n\nSometime you have to be your own advocate and stand up for yourself and set those boundaries.

First of all congratulations for losing all that weight.  Keep up the good work!  Your parents seem to have problems with boundaries, and they were totally in the wrong for treating you so unkindly.  It would have been bad had they said these things even if you all were alone, but the public shaming in front of others was over the top.  Since you are an adult, they should be treating you the same way they would treat a friend.  It's none of their business what you eat, and fat shaming is a weird way of showing \"love.\"  They owe you an apology.  Because you asked if you were the AH, it makes me wonder if you don't realize how very dysfunctional your family dynamic is.

If you forced yourself to stay under 1000 calories, you'd lose a lot of weight, but the second you started eating a more normal diet, you'd put a lot back on, because your body on 1000 calories looks very different than your body on 2200 calories. Same with if you started a crazy exercise regime that you could only keep up for a few months.\n\nIf you can make moderate changes to your habits and keep up with those changes, you'll be much more likely to stick with them, and to keep this fitness level as your 'new normal.'
