Good for you for your weight loss progress so far!! As someone who has also lost a lot of weight, people are unfortunately going to have SO MUCH commentary regarding what you\u2019re eating, exercise, etc. There\u2019s a difference between your family privately having conversations with you regarding health concerns with your weight vs publicly shaming you.

I\u2019m a silent attritioner - I might have stayed for dinner, not eaten anything, and never gone back. Kudos to you for leaving that terrible environment. You don\u2019t need to apologize - you deserve the apology. And even then, I\u2019d think very strongly about Christmas.", "NTA.  \nFirst, congrats on your progress!!

It\u2019s perfectly ok to have a treat while trying to get healthy. \n\nYour parents are well out of order. That is not the way to support you.

There is no shaming out of \"love.\" They don't know better about your own body than you, and a hershey kiss isn't going to literally anything to your body or your weight loss plan. \n\nThey were rude and even admit they were that way on purpose.

I hope you are proud of yourself and remember to have those cheat meals or a sweet or two to treat yourself. It's so important because if it is all or nothing, you will absolutely fall off the diet because it is so depressing to never indulge at all.", "NTA. Congratulations on your weight loss.  As a doctor, you're doing it in a sustainable way which is far better for you.

You get to tell abusive fuckwads exactly what you think and it reduces future fuckery.

I'm proud of you!", "NTA. Their behavior is not \"for your benefit.\" Things that benefit you are kindness, support and prolly noticing your health improvements.\n\nHeck, a Hershey's kiss is about 25 calories! Geez! I firmly believe it is better to eat one kiss (or cookie, or whatever) rather than deny yourself and then eat 1/2 lb of chocolate at home alone.\n\nYou sound terrific!

I'm not sure what your family's damage is, but these are not nice people. Noone wants to start a family dinner as the target of uncalled for derision.

Who the hell brings wine to someone who is trying to get sober? That's just 9 kinds of mean. I also hate the 'but we're worried so being mean is fine! It's tough love!'. Like...no one has ever overcome anything with that kind of 'excused cruelty'. Ever. Plus I have had a few friends and a sibling deal with eating disorders and it's a miserable existence that I wouldn't wish on anyone. (My brother got hit especially hard by it because so many people don't think men can have disordered eating issues. At least not where we lived at the time.) \n\nBut damn, you're getting sober AND losing  weight! That's incredible! (4 years sober myself) You're doing very difficult work, I know.

Tell them that you have a professional medical team that is working with you and you are following the guidelines and recommendations of PROFESSIONAL people with experience in this matter. Their comments, opinions, suggestions, or whatever need to be kept to themselves full stop. One word about your diet, weight, what you put on your plate/in your mouth, and you will up and leave period. Zero second chances. If they continue to push, and you want to see your family, consider stopping by AFTER food/desert to say hi. You do not have to subject yourself to this type of behavior. Does not matter where they are coming from. You are doing amazing and you have the results to show for it. Continue to do what you are doing with the help of your doctor. Slow and steady will win this for you. Making meaningful changes is the key. Try to not let them get in your head.", "NTA.

They had no right to berate you like they did and if you felt uncomfortable then good on you for removing yourself from the situation. You seem to be doing well, losing 30 lbs in 4 months, keep it up and if they are like this, it makes me wonder if they did this growing up and maybe thats how you ended up overweight to begin with... have they always bullied you like this?", "Definitely NTA. My mother does this to me all the time. I too have lost some weight over the last couple of months, and put my diabetes 2 into remission, but all she does is tell me I still need to lose weight and that I am still diabetic and in danger of losing my sight - tests have proved that to be untrue.\n\nLosing weight is such a hard thing to do - I have an ED - I am an emotional eater and definitely eat my feelings, but when food is your addiction, you cannot just cut it out as we need to eat. I don't understand her attitude - I have lost weight, quit smoking and quit drinking, and yet, because I am still overweight, she somehow seems to think she is just showing her concern for me by commenting on my size.\n\nThis is not about showing how concerned they are for your health, this is about being  bullies who get pleasure out of hurting you.  You did not sour the evening, they did!\n\nMy mother often asks my sister why I never ring her and rarely see her, and when she is told why, she will spend hours showing how she is right and I am just being oversensitive because I don't like to hear the truth.\n\nCongratulations on your weight loss - you are doing so well and I'm sorry your family sucks.", "NTA\n\nHow dare they! You\u2019ve done a bloody excellent job & people shouldn\u2019t comment on others weight regardless of who they are, related or not.  \nIve been the recipient of some \u2019interesting\u2019 behaviour since loosing weight. I had gastric sleeve surgery in April. I\u2019m 54 & due to a complex set of health issues was unable to loose weight without surgery. I\u2019m so glad I did, it\u2019s the best investment I ever made in myself, but peoples reactions are\u2026. Weird?\n\nSome of my family are so invested they ask every single time I see them how much weight I\u2019ve lost and have spoken to me more in the last 6 months than in the last 6 years.

When I was a teen and into my early thirties i was skinny, and sometimes too skinny due to mental health issues. People don\u2019t mind telling you when they think you\u2019re too skinny either.   \nWriting this has made me realise how much emphasis has been put on the way I look not the person I am throughout my life.   \n\n\nPlease continue to be the best you you can be & don\u2019t listen to anyone else.

You are doing brilliantly and just keep on doing what your doing", "NTA. One of the reasons so many people gain all the weight back they lose dieting is following a diet so strict that it is not manageable long term.   Allowing yourself a small treat here and there prevents binging on treats in the long run. In many cases if the original diet is too calorie deficit your metabolism is permanently altered, meaning that if you do have a pit stop along your journey to get to a healthy weight, getting back on track is going to be harder and harder. \n\nYou are taking the approach your doctor recommended, and have amazing results to show for it. Just getting into the non obese category on the BMI scale with statistical significance adds years to the average person life expectancy. Congratulations, you are awesome, keep up the amazing work! \n\nYou owe no one an apology, you are owed one. They are being a crappy support system. You were not shoving a pie in your face, just eating one small treat when presented with the option to gouge at a thanksgiving feast is a victory in itself.", "NTA. Your parents are though. The best and healthiest way to lose weight is going slow and steady, just like you're doing. Drastic weight loss is very bad for you, and you'd just gain it back again after a while.

Please go to friends' or non- toxic relatives for other upcoming holidays and avoid the Thanksgiving bunch.", "Your mother and stepfather behaved like assholes. If that had happened to me, I would have left immediately.", "NTA.  Your diet, your business.  They don\u2019t get to yell at an adult over the food being consumed.", "NTA.  Good for you for the 30 lb weight loss.  It's not easy to do.  And of course what's easier to do is to tell your mom, step father and sister to keep their opinions to themselves and to mind their own business.  And leave like you did.  No one needs criticizing and judgmental  people in their lives.  Go low contact and good luck to you.", "NTA.\n\nNo one should mention the weight of anyone else unless that conversation is invited by that person.", "First, HECK YES, FRIEND! Congratulations, what you\u2019ve already accomplished is incredible and you should be so proud of yourself!\n\nAnd straight up, NTA. The only reason your sister is getting on your case is because she chose to stay while your parents lamented being treated like the unsupportive lamp-stands they chose to be. Thats on her. And as for them? Pffft. Love never breeds shame, it\u2019s an excuse to be cruel.\n\nYou are never TA for protecting yourself. And the self-respect you showed is also a huge deal. Good for you!\n\nOne more time, congrats on the massive success!!!", "NTA  shaming you like that is horrible, especially during a holiday and after you\u2019ve been working so hard.  Stay strong and keep getting healthier the right way.  You deserve it", "NTA - and fuck them.", "NTA, they are not supporting you in any way.   You owe no one an apology.   Your parents soured the evening.", "NTA and never go back!", "Nta, it's thanksgivings, everyone knows thanksgivings is about the food coma we're about to enter. It's not for respecting diets or thinking about weight loss, massively hypocritical of them to jump on you like they weren't about to dive face first into pumpkin pie with whip cream.", "NTA OP. Great job on your weight loss. And great job on protecting yourself and removing yourself from a bad situation.", "NTA. I know that most people are no contact, but you really need to ask yourself, what do they add or nourish in your life? Just because they're family doesn't mean you have to set yourself on fire to keep them warm! Do what's best for you, if that means cutting them, and anyone who supports their harmful views, out of your life, so be it. That includes your sister and any family or friends who stand with them! You are listening to your doctor. You are losing weight safely. Thats what matters. The fact that they feel, they did nothing wrong, says alot.", "NTA - this would have been a miserable evening with them monitoring every bite you put in your mouth. You didn't \"sour\" things - they did.", "NTA and a quick answer to your sister... \"F- Off!!\"", "No, they need to apologize to u for shaming u.", "NTA of course and great job on your healthier lifestyle. You\u2019re doing great.", "Congratulations on your progress! As a fellow overweight person I know the struggles of losing and it is incredibly hard. Shaming is not the same as encouraging and you should not be made to feel bad about anything. You are definitely NTA and your family should be ashamed of themselves.", "NTA. Your former family sucks. Congrats on the progress and good luck as you continue the journey!", "Yeah, a part of me thinks my mother might want me to develop an ED.  When I told her my doctor recommended a diet of 2200 calories a day (I am over 6\u2019 tall and I just started walking most places), my mother replied by saying if I really wanted to lose weight, I would keep myself under 1000 calories a day.  I listened to my doctor, and I still lost a lot of weight.", "Adding on to this, make plans for Christmas and New Year\u2019s which do not include them.", "I know, right.  Honestly, I skipped dinner that night, which was foolish on afterthought but I really did not feel like eating at all at that moment.", "Christmas I will make myself a stir fry and see if any of my AA friends are available as some of them were AHs in their addiction, lost their families but they are in recovery now.", "The thing is my biggest problem wasn\u2019t even sweets.  My biggest problem was salty snacks.  I cut those out of my life allowing them only on holidays and special occasions.  Doritos are my Kryptonite.\n\nI also lost a fair amount of weight a while ago without even trying when I stopped drinking alcohol and joined AA.", "That won\u2019t work with my parents.  My mother would then cause a massive scene about how calm she is and how irrational I am.  Just leaving was my best choice.", "Yeah, they love pointing out how worried they are for me because all of the fat on my body is in my belly, around my organs.  They claim that is the most unhealthy way for a body to store fat, and even though I now need to wear a belt with every pair of pants I own, they still love to point out I still need to lose another 30 lbs.", "I know.  I had a one day relapse a few months after I first joined AA.  My mother found out about that and then demanded an apology from me for not letting her have her wine at my house since apparently I was drinking again.\n\nI think I need a different family.", "They have always bullied me like this, actually.  My sister is the golden child in the family here.  I was born with autism, so they felt the need to not take what I say seriously and really hammer in what they want me to do with my life.  My mother once even had a restraining order placed against her by my therapist when I was an adult and living alone, just because she did not like how my therapist was encouraging me to change jobs when I was unhappy with the job I had.  I still do not know how she found out which clinic I was going to, and that scares me.", "My mother keeps on telling me she is worried I am diabetic even though I told her my doctor tested for it.  The doctor pulled a whole bunch of tests on me.  My cholesterol is normal.  My blood sugar is normal.  My heart rate is normal.  Everything is working quite well except for the excess weight on my belly.  And then my mother says she is worried because all of my fat is around my organs, and that is extremely unhealthy, and that if I do not get serious about losing weight by doing all of the fad diet shit she pushes on me, that proves to her that I do not want to live.\n\nI wish I was not making this up.", "You might want to switch your N A H TO NTA. I think, if I understand your comment correctly, you think the parents are wrong.", "They are hyper focused on the fact that I still have a beer belly.  It has been shrinking, but they claim I still have a very long way to go.  And my mother telling me that if I really wanted to lose weight, I would keep myself under 1000 calories a day - that helped convince me that I am not dealing with reasonable people here.", "Well, my mother did once have a hissy fit when I told her she could not bring wine to my house after I just joined AA a couple of months earlier, so I doubt I am dealing with reasonable people.  Still, the rest of the family wanted to spend time with me.", "Yeah, I pretty much had no appetite for dinner after I got home from that.  If I had stayed, they would have called me a drama queen over having no appetite.", "I had the cab pick me up in front of a Starbucks that was a mile away.  I did not want to give my mother the satisfaction of a scene.", "My parents were hosting this at their house.  They were the ones who chastised me.  If it were somewhere else I might have stayed.", "Oh fuck that noise. Did anyone else stick up for OP? No? They\u2019re just as guilty.", "Two people too many.  The rest of the family didn\u2019t stick up for OP and call out the parents on their nastiness did they? \n\nOP was right to leave. NTA. OP has the right to defend themselves and leave if they are being treated poorly.", "No the parents are the ones that ruined Thanksgiving and all their guests holiday experience.  Had the parents acted as respectful adults and kept their mouth shut the whole episode would have never happened", "Under 1000 calories a day? That\u2019s not just ignorant, it\u2019s dangerous! Good on you, for listening to your doctor instead of this nonsense. I\u2019ve been working on my own slow but healthy weight loss and I\u2019ve had to listen to my mom encourage me to take these \u201cvery safe\u201d weight loss gummies that will make me lose 40 pounds in a month. My mom has always been obsessed with weight loss gimmicks instead of a healthy diet and exercise. I tried to explain that these trends are why she can never keep the weight off but she won\u2019t hear of it. \n\nYou are definitely NTA for both sticking up for yourself and leaving someplace you were no longer comfortable.", "Good for you, for sticking to the advice of your doctor.", "No one should have under 1000 calories ever to lose weight. Minimum 1500 for men and 1200 for women to not end up with life threatening nutrition deficiencies typically. Unless you're a child or like 4 foot tall then maybe I could understand a little less but nah, listen to your doctor and congrats on the weight loss. Idk how you're tracking your calories and nutrients but I highly suggest the app myfitnesspal if you're looking for something to help keep track of your progress.", "1,000 calories is insane for an adult of any size, but where a lot of people fuck up is if you're larger you actually have a higher level of maintenance calories as well. So what you can safely cut back to is different than it would be for a thinner person. I think this leads to a lot of misunderstanding and a lot of bad health decisions sometimes. Good for you for sticking with your doctor's advice.", "And I'm proud of you op. Listen to your doctor. I bet you'd feel a lot more weight lifted off  if you limit the toxicity in your life too. Here's to 30+ more!!", "I'm a 5'6\" woman who eats 1750 calories a day to maintain a weight of 125 pounds. 1000 calories a day for you would be absolutely insane.", "Your mother has no idea how healthy and sustained weight loss works. Ignore her. It was frickin Thanksgiving fgs. You're doing great, well done you!", "Under 1000 calories your body will likely go into survival mode and start storing fat. So unhealthy. Definitely go with your doctor.", "Yikes! I'm 5'2\" and eating 1000/day would be too little for, never mind someone over 6'.", "Good for you OP! I'm glad you walked out.  I deal with my dad watching every piece of food I put in my mouth and rationing what he's offering to  me.", "And who could blame you? I'd lose my appetite, too.", "Rock on!", "Sounds like you made a lot of positive changes in your life! You\u2019re doing ever so well, and you deserve supportive people in your life. Sadly, your parents/sister are not those people. \n\nMake some awesome Christmas plans without them unless they apologise.", "You sure didn't make it sound like she was calm.", "I know you're not making it up - sounds like we have the same mother! She even commented on my nephew's weight last year, telling him he was gross and fat!\n\nMy mother does not know how to be pleasant to me - I did use to think maybe I was being over sensitive about it, but I was talking to my son-in-law the other day, and he assured me I was not over-reacting, and that she constantly insulted and berated me.\n\nMy brother is an alcoholic and is very thin, and she will often compare the two of us size wise - I have said that she sounds like she would be happier if I was an alcoholic rather than a fatty, but apparently I was being ridiculous. Both my sister and I have told her repeatedly to stop mentioning my weight, but I personally feel that she delights in tormenting me. TBH, I would prefer to go NC with her, but my kids love her, so involve her in their lives, but I spent most of last Christmas in tears with the abuse I got, and this year, we are having Christmas with my daughters in their place, so I have said my mother can stay with my elder daughter in the larger house where all the celebrations will take place, and I will stay in my younger daughter's flat, so at least I can get some reprieve from her.\n\nAs a mother, I cannot imagine ever hurting my children the way she hurts me, and I do not understand how she doesn't see what she is doing to me - she is an intelligent woman. I guess her power play is more important to her than I am, so I have as little to do with her as I possibly can because otherwise I think I might explode.", "Whoops, yep that was probs a typo!", "It takes time, healthy eating, and exercise, ALL OF WHICH YOU ARE DOING. One piece of candy isn't going to make a difference.\nIf they're so concerned, then why didn't they put out a veggie tray, or some fruit, or a nut bowl?????? This for everyone.", "I am sorry your mum is so crazy it sounds like a pain in the ass. Do you think that maybe she's deflecting? Like maybe she has her own insecurities and she's taking it out on you? It just doesn't sound like it's even about you since you're obviously doing so great.", "I wouldn't have had an appetite after that either.    \nIf it were me , I just wouldn't go to any more family functions at all.", "Also, I salute you for not taking the diet gummy pills.  I have an aunt who is a fiend for diet pills, it really screws with her head big time as those pills are essentially legalized meth.", "Yeah, I thought that too when my mother made that statement.", "Just eat Haribo gummy bears instant weight loss", "It's also futile because nobody can keep up a 1000 calorie diet forever. It's great (/s) if you want to \"lose a dress size by Saturday\" to \"catch that hot guy\" as  80s women's magazines would have it, but it's utterly useless if you want a long term sustainable healthy diet.", "OP, good on you for taking the safe and steady route - especially the walking.  \n\n\nRise and grind!", "MyFitnessPal is what I use, actually.", "I lost mine just reading about it, poor OP.", ">If they're so concerned, then why didn't they put out a veggie tray, or some fruit, or a nut bowl?????\n\nOooh, I didn't even think of that.\n\nNow that we know what kind of people they are, and seeing how quickly they pounced on him... doesn't seem too far fetched that the candy bowl was placed *deliberately* to instigate the confrontation.", "I have no doubt that my mother is a functional alcoholic.  I also have no doubt that she is addicted to food - she is full of unhealthy advice on how to lose weight but she is not losing any herself.  I could shame her over that if I wanted to, but that would be an AH move.  I\u2019d rather just avoid her.", "I have a friend who took some sort of diet pills. They gave her serious and irreversible heart problems.", "fuck pills mate, slow and steady you ll get where you want to be", "You mean sugar free gummy bears? Because I\u2019ve been down that road and it is ugly. Lol", "That's the app my husband used several years ago to eventually lose 105lbs. He did it over the course of about 9 or 10 months.\n\n\n\nGood luck in your journey to better health! You're NTA.", "Me too! It\u2019s so great. I had no idea how much I was overeating until I started tracking my calories in that app. \n\nReally amazing to see how the calories add up. \n\nYour parents acted like jerks, and you were NTA to refuse to tolerate it. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s Thanksgiving. It\u2019s about eating. A cheat day here and there doesn\u2019t set back weight loss. It\u2019s the CONSTANT overeating that does it. \n\nYou\u2019re doing great and I wish you the best of luck on your continued journey.", "One wonders.", "Thank you for the guffaw remembering the Amazon reviews!"]}
