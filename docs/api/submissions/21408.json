You don\u2019t own your high school boyfriends future relationships in any way- and if you\u2019re not close enough to your cousin to tell her you\u2019d dated him you have no claim to any sort of feelings as to them dating now. \nHer petty jealous behavior crosses the line too. She should not have asked for or accepted any help from you if she wasn\u2019t going to invite you. Especially if she already knew about your past dating history. This changes slightly if you had already helped her BEFORE she found out you\u2019d dated her fianc\u00e9.", "ESH (you and the husband) you both should have told the bride/cousin as soon as you realized.", "Tbh you could have told your cousin sooner. In fact it would have been the best thing for you to do, because then you could have explained how and why things ended and she would have known there was no lingering feelings. That makes you an arsehole but hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nShe's clearly threatened by the joke made and the fact that he's previously dated you, but she's marrying him & providing there's been no indication of anything happening between you and her husband/your ex since they got together, she should be more confident in her relationship and not feel threatened in a way that bans you from her wedding in case you still want him. \n\nHe is a huge arsehole, he should have told her out of respect for her as soon as he realised you were her cousin. He should have given her opportunity to think on whether she wanted a relationship with someone who has previously been in a relationship with her own family member. \n\nYour family shouldn't be threatening not to go. All it's going to do is fester more resentment towards you (you will certainly be blamed) and hurt those who miss the wedding and hurt the bride whose loved ones are missing the wedding. \n\nThe rest? The petty revenge? Yeah that was arseholeish too but I can understand you feeling really hurt. Especially after financially contributing to the wedding. You've made your point clear now & whilst I do believe asking for your contribution back is fair, it isn't a hill I would personally die on. I'd tell her it's a wedding gift and wish her luck but I'd also explain that you didn't tell her because you were that over him but you realise now that you should have and you didn't ever mean for her to be hurt. I'd also remind her that you're absolutely not in love with him, if nothing else it might help her anxiety a little. \n\nSo all in all: everyone sucks \n\nBUT I can imagine you're still really hurt, especially over the damage to your relationship with your cousin.
