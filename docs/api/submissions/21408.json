You don\u2019t own your high school boyfriends future relationships in any way- and if you\u2019re not close enough to your cousin to tell her you\u2019d dated him you have no claim to any sort of feelings as to them dating now. \nHer petty jealous behavior crosses the line too. She should not have asked for or accepted any help from you if she wasn\u2019t going to invite you. Especially if she already knew about your past dating history. This changes slightly if you had already helped her BEFORE she found out you\u2019d dated her fianc\u00e9.", "ESH (you and the husband) you both should have told the bride/cousin as soon as you realized.", "Tbh you could have told your cousin sooner. In fact it would have been the best thing for you to do, because then you could have explained how and why things ended and she would have known there was no lingering feelings.

He should have given her opportunity to think on whether she wanted a relationship with someone who has previously been in a relationship with her own family member. \n\nYour family shouldn't be threatening not to go. All it's going to do is fester more resentment towards you (you will certainly be blamed) and hurt those who miss the wedding and hurt the bride whose loved ones are missing the wedding. \n\nThe rest? The petty revenge? Yeah that was arseholeish too but I can understand you feeling really hurt. Especially after financially contributing to the wedding. You've made your point clear now & whilst I do believe asking for your contribution back is fair, it isn't a hill I would personally die on. I'd tell her it's a wedding gift and wish her luck but I'd also explain that you didn't tell her because you were that over him but you realise now that you should have and you didn't ever mean for her to be hurt. I'd also remind her that you're absolutely not in love with him, if nothing else it might help her anxiety a little. \n\nSo all in all: everyone sucks \n\nBUT I can imagine you're still really hurt, especially over the damage to your relationship with your cousin.

Is that great? No. Does it still happen? Yes. \n\nRe: the fianc\u00e9. \nHe didn\u2019t know they were related until they were already dating, so who cares about the past. And he probably didn\u2019t ask the op if it was ok he was dating her cousin, he probably just talked to her to make sure she didn\u2019t cause a scene, like some ex\u2019s would do, and clearly she didn\u2019t.", "And you would describe your relationship with this family member as \"not very close,\" as in I didn't notice that you were engaged to my ex, but I'm not going to mention it because we don't really talk.", "It's more of a courteous heads up, \n\n\"Hey, I knew your cousin in high school, and we dated for a bit. It was nothing serious, and we grew apart and realised it wasn't love.\" \n\nOr something like that so that if it ever comes up, your current partner isn't blindsided, it's not about the ex or the past relationship but more about accepting that there is a chance of bumping into this person regularly and on holidays and that some partners might not be ok with that and letting them decide for themselves. \n\nAlso, if this is kept a secret, and no one knows and gets OP and the ex to run an errand together or something without the wife, and then the wife finds out later, she might start questioning every moment they were in eachothers vicinity (no matter how innocent their interactions were). \n\nIt's just a lot cleaner, to be honest upfront.", "Spoke to them once 5 years prior, and maybe a couple of times since 2010."]}
