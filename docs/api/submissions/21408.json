You're only also an AH for saying you \"let her\" date your ex as if either of them ever needed your permission. Which they didn't. But otherwise mostly she is the bigger AH.", "ESH, but I approve of your level of petty. Wasn\u2019t a fan of the wording \u201cI let my cousin date\u201d but the whole thing got your point across \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "ESH. Your cousin should have found out from you or her fianc\u00e9 that you\u2019d dated whenever the two of you realized the connection. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her because we weren\u2019t that close\u201d is a horrible excuse\u2026 same with whatever excuse the fianc\u00e9 had. You 1) you didn\u2019t \u201clet\u201d anyone date and 2) nobody cares if you were \u201cfine\u201d with them being together. You don\u2019t own your high school boyfriends future relationships in any way- and if you\u2019re not close enough to your cousin to tell her you\u2019d dated him you have no claim to any sort of feelings as to them dating now. \nHer petty jealous behavior crosses the line too. She should not have asked for or accepted any help from you if she wasn\u2019t going to invite you. Especially if she already knew about your past dating history. This changes slightly if you had already helped her BEFORE she found out you\u2019d dated her fianc\u00e9.", "ESH (you and the husband) you both should have told the bride/cousin as soon as you realized.", "Tbh you could have told your cousin sooner. In fact it would have been the best thing for you to do, because then you could have explained how and why things ended and she would have known there was no lingering feelings. That makes you an arsehole but hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nShe's clearly threatened by the joke made and the fact that he's previously dated you, but she's marrying him & providing there's been no indication of anything happening between you and her husband/your ex since they got together, she should be more confident in her relationship and not feel threatened in a way that bans you from her wedding in case you still want him. \n\nHe is a huge arsehole, he should have told her out of respect for her as soon as he realised you were her cousin. He should have given her opportunity to think on whether she wanted a relationship with someone who has previously been in a relationship with her own family member. \n\nYour family shouldn't be threatening not to go. All it's going to do is fester more resentment towards you (you will certainly be blamed) and hurt those who miss the wedding and hurt the bride whose loved ones are missing the wedding. \n\nThe rest? The petty revenge? Yeah that was arseholeish too but I can understand you feeling really hurt. Especially after financially contributing to the wedding. You've made your point clear now & whilst I do believe asking for your contribution back is fair, it isn't a hill I would personally die on. I'd tell her it's a wedding gift and wish her luck but I'd also explain that you didn't tell her because you were that over him but you realise now that you should have and you didn't ever mean for her to be hurt. I'd also remind her that you're absolutely not in love with him, if nothing else it might help her anxiety a little. \n\nSo all in all: everyone sucks \n\nBUT I can imagine you're still really hurt, especially over the damage to your relationship with your cousin. Are you doing okay?", "ESH but post this on r/pettyrevenge and maybe people will like it better. \n\nHonestly, 90% of the posts in this sub are either ESH or painfully oblivious.", "ESH, your insta post of \u201cletting her date your ex\u201d is just plain weird because neither of you own him, and she for taking help from you without compensating for it.", "I think I might be the asshole because she was really excited about the wedding and posting that wasn\u2019t good i know but I don\u2019t meant for people to drop out of the wedding and they aren\u2019t even sure if they will do the wedding anymore. \ud83d\ude41", "ESH . You and the Bride are as immature as each other.", "ESH. If you didn't get a formal invitation, you're not invited. I feel like there's some missing information if your cousin thinks you still like her husband. You're making it sound like you didn't talk to your cousin much, if at all, then you're suddenly spending money on her wedding and care so much. She was an AH for allowing you to help with no intention of having you there, but you're a massive AH for posting something so disgusting on social media where you knew your family would see. Also, saying you \"let\" your cousin date your ex shows that you still have some sort of feeling toward him.", "ESH.   Y'all both have some maturing to do.", "ESH, that's vindictive as hell, you both are acting petty and childish. Obviously not cool for her to both not have you at the wedding AND not give you your money back, and pretty clear she's not mature enough to be married *to anyone* if she thinks every single person her fiance has ever dated is trying to steal him away if they ever interact, but yeah again your reaction was quite vindictive.\n\nEsp. since you literally lied? \"I let my cousin date my ex\" that's...not at all what happened according to how you tell the story? So you're just lying to make her look as bad as possible. It's petty and childish beavhior, just like her behavior is also petty and childish.", "NTA\n\nVote changed due to advocacy of u/Ok_Path1734\n\nI am the asshole for my poor reading comprehension.", "The boyfriend/husband is the asshole for dating 2 women from the same family. Your cousin should blame him for people dropping out of the wedding.", "You both are kinda assholes. I don\u2019t completely side with her actions (especially telling you very last minute about not being invited and then not paying you back for the money you contributed) but the way you responded to all of that made you an asshole too.", "Info: How long has it been since she found out you two dated? How long had they been dating by then? What has the vibe been like when you\u2019ve hung out since she\u2019s known - you say you\u2019ve been helping her with the wedding, has she been friendly and talked like you would be attending? What did you spend money on, and was it money she asked you to spend?\n\nI have way too many questions. This post makes no sense.", "NTA you could have handled that better. But it\u2019s a hard situation to be in. It feels like she used you and then once you were not useful anymore informed you that your not coming. Had she had the stance from the beginning this would be a different story. Idk it\u2019s kind of petty to burn \ud83d\udd25 down her whole weddings because you got your feelings hurt.", "ESH, She just found out about your prior relationship with her fiance, so she was probably shocked and feeling jealous. She still should have spoken to you told you how she was feeling before retracting the invitation. \n\nHer fiance is mainly the one to blame. 2 years is a big deal, even if you were very young. He should have told her from the very beginning about your previous relationship. \n\nYou should have said something to her far before the wedding when it was clear he hadn't said anything. Although uninviting you was a childish overreaction, you going nuclear and posting that on Instagram was also a huge overreaction, and super tacky. You arenall a big mess and need to grow up.", "She refuses to say what she spent money on. \n\nIf it's something like a dress or new shoes then the bride is right to pay for it.", "Your cousin should blame him for people dropping out of the wedding.", "All she had to do was give her the money she spent on the wedding.

I find it a little unbelievable that her cousin never met OP's bf in 2 years of dating.", "it was on both of them to tell her, they dated one another, it takes two people in that scenario. so yes, he\u2019s just as much at fault for not telling the cousin. the ultimatum shouldn\u2019t have happened to begin with, the other option was childish and petty, especially since op blasted it online. \n\nthe cousin should\u2019ve given herself time to process it and think it over, but op handled the situation poorly.", "The groom dated Op for two years and then his bride for two years. We are to believe the groom never was invited to a family event in four years. I don\u2019t think OP is a reliable narrator.", "No, it was on her husband to tell her. The cousin doesn't have to disclose her past relationships. But a future spouse should mention that they dated a family member before."]}
