Mainly due to your lack of communication early on.  You pretended to be ok with the dog sleeping on the bed and now all of a sudden its \"non-negotiable\" and gross. You can't just spring this on her and give ultimatums. I have a feeling this will not go your way.", "YTA\n\nYou went along with a dog\u2019s behavior for several years, kept quiet, and now that you\u2019re moving in, you call the behavior a deal breaker? If it was a deal breaker, you should have let her know before this so she could decide whether time spent on you was worth it.\n\nYou betrayed your GF\u2019s trust here. Known deal breakers aren\u2019t something you hide for 2 and a half years.", "YTA for this reason only: you waited until you were at the MOVING IN TOGETHER STAGE before discussing your non-negotiables. \n\nThis is like\u2026 third date material. Waiting until you have someone \u201ctrapped\u201d to reveal you aren\u2019t all that compatible is shitty, and a big waste of everyone\u2019s time. \n\nThe fact that this was a non-negotiable but you \u201cput up with it\u201d until you were closer is even shittier. Just tell the truth.", "YTA. That dog is already grandfathered in as far as sleeping on the bed goes. Sadly he's probably toward the end of his days so there is no reason to change it. This is a take it or leave it deal for you.\n\nIn the future if you two end up getting another dog this can be renegotiated. But this is already a done deal.", "NAH. The dog is old and accustomed to this. 9 is pretty senior and you already have him not on the bed when you\u2019re in it. Get a dog blanket for the bed if it bothers you this much.", "NAH...

You said it yourself, the dog is a big part of her life.\n\nI think you\u2019ll need to learn to adjust having 4-legged company near you while you sleep. If it\u2019s a sanitary issue, get baby wipes. Wipe the toosh free of dingleberries and wipe the paws every night before the dog gets into bed. And trust me when I say in the 5 or so years when that dog passes, you\u2019re going to want their company and regret not letting him/her up on the bed at night.

That's basically telling her \"kick your old beloved dog out of bed or we can't live together\" which is a pretty crappy move.\n\nYou should have shared your opinions before this point and now you've basically given her an ultimatum that personally???

Not fuckin cool\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had my oldest dog about the same time she\u2019s had hers. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep soundly kicking him out of the bed like that all of a sudden.

I actually think it\u2019s a great compromise that the dog doesn\u2019t sleep on the bed at night but can hop up in the morning.  You knew what you were getting into.  Going into the discussion telling her it\u2019s a non negotiable (when it\u2019s such a minor thing) isn\u2019t the way you communicate and resolve differences in a relationship. \n\nNAH for disagreeing about whether dogs should sleep on the bed or not in general.", "Yta. I hate sleeping in bed with my husband's puggo. Puggo is great puggo is awesome. Puggo also has this super power where he can increase his gravitational pull if you need him to move so you can shift your body. I have arthritis and need to shift often in my sleep. My dog feels my toe twitch and will get off the bed or couch and is 5x the size of puggo. Puggo turns from 20lbs of dead weight to 300 if you need to move. But puggo also came before me and I refuse to kick him out of the bed even if that means waking up 4-6x in a night to move the little asshole from where he wedged between my legs in the most uncomfortable position.", "YTA\n\nYou should have spoken up way up front. You get to have your boundaries but the ship sailed on this one. \n\nFor me, this would be a relationship ending thing. My dog prefers to be near us while sleeping and I prefer him close too.

Hope she leaves you", "YTA - not for having that boundary, but for choosing not to voice it until now. You've been dating for 2 years, and never mentioned this? This is clearly part of her dog's routine and is pretty normal for them, it will be quite hard for her to train him out of it. But suddenly now, when you start to think about moving in, it becomes a non-negotiable rule? Dude, I'd be mad if I were her. Regardless of intent, it comes off as you being needlessly controlling. \n\nRethink if this is actually non-negotiable for you here.  Your GF has lived with her dog for years, she's just now starting to consider living with you.", "YTA the dog has a routine and you want to break that.

Dogs can be trained to sleep on a dog bed beside the bed, but it takes work. I googled the lifespan of the breed it says 8-10 years usually. You said this was not negotiable. It is up to you of course, but I would maybe let it slide for this dog only, No other pets will sleep in the bed ever.\n\nI would hate to share a bed with a dog too.

I've owned cats since I was a teenager and none of the above has ever made a dent in how much I love having a pet cuddled up next to me each night. Someone coming along and telling me after 2+ years that I need to change that because they aren't a fan of pets on a bed hasn't got a hope in hell!", "When I started staying at my bf\u2019s with my dog (little chihuahua mix) he said he didn\u2019t want my dog to sleep on the bed. Throughout the time of me coming over with dog and me trying to keep dog off, he realized it was really hard to teach a dog that was accustomed to sleeping on them to no to. As our relationship got stronger so did his with my dog. He now invites her onto his lap when he\u2019s gaming and makes a little pocket under the sheets for her. I\u2019ve also woken up to times of her snuggling with him more than me cause I move a lot. 1 year ago we got a puppy that would be our dog, but gonna be referred to as his dog. BF did not shy from introducing his dog to sleeping on the bed and now sleeps with both dogs on the bed cuddling up to him even though his dog is now a medium sized. \n\nMy point being is that it\u2019s insane to me that OP has never brought this up before or with the time of spending time and putting up with dog on bed, hasn\u2019t changed his stance. Bringing this up as they are talking of moving into together 2 years later is an asshole move. YTA.", "not even iranian yogurt", "You are absolutely right on the money. Any man who wants to share my bed with me can expect to also share it with my hundred-pound dog.

She probably would've told him to hit the road, but instead, he wanted to not say anything until he felt more secure about it. Not cool. \n\nI have to vote YTA for OP.

Simple conversations such \"Hey, when I'm over, would it be cool if your dog doesn't sleep in the bed with us? I'm not comfortable with that\" and that's perfectly fine. That's communicating with your partner and asking instead of demanding. It truly depends on the tone.\n\nHe states himself it's non-negiotable, especially because he doesn't even wanna discuss it, why didn't he mention it from the very beginning? He says so himself he never liked the idea of dogs sleeping in beds with their owners. From the sounds of it, he also moved into her place, so making the discussion not even possible is what makes him YTA in my book.\n\nHe had plenty of time to bring up the disucssion and have a civil conversation with her and not just throw it in her face when they discussed moving together. \n\nIt is possible you might be right that most of reddit might have said red flag, etc., but I don't think that would be accurate if he had tried to bring it up early enough to talk and discuss it with her. It's setting healthy boundaries, but if those also involve something your partner has done or does, it needs to be done in a discussion with them. Especially if you consider, **English bulldogs average lifespan is only 8-10 years**. The dog is **very old** and one of the reasons why it might jump up in the morning that it might think it's possibly the only time where he won't get told to go off right away. Realistically speaking, if the dog perceives it as a too much drastic change eventually, it could cause serious stress levels.", "I basically got the same ultimatum - it did not go in the ex\u2019s favor.", "Yeah, withholding information like that is honestly kind of manipulative.

This is the part that confuses me. Like, if the dog had always slept in the bed, at what point did it transition to OP\u2019s gf buying a dog bed and the dog sleeping there? Like, what made the gf decide to buy a dog bed in the first place and have it start sleeping on it?\n\nAlso, I know you guys are gonna downvote the hell out of this, but I have all vets in my family and in a past life I trained dogs. Dogs are crazy adaptable and easy to train, so keeping the dog off the bed is not like the end of the world. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to go into severe depression because he can\u2019t come up on the bed in the mornings. So, imo, this is a non issue. Dogs jumping up on bass actually causes a LOT of hip and joint issues and animals do carry fleas, worms, dandruff, dirt, etc. I have a cat and I let the cat sleep in my bed because 1) cats are very clean animals and 2) my cat\u2019s hips aren\u2019t in jeopardy from jumping. In other words, OP is well within his rights to not want a dog in the bed. \n\nWhat IS the issue is that the dog was here first and humans (rightfully so!) become very attached to their animals.

I am gonna be pretty certain this might end up in a break up, whilst I wish for the two of you that it won't, I'm pretty sure it might though. For future relationships, please bring those things up right away. This is very important and there are ways how you can word it in a way to be able to allow your partner to have a discussion with you, e.g. *\"Hey, when I'm over, would it be cool if your dog doesn't sleep in the bed with us? I'm not comfortable with that\".* Then, after a few months or years, you both wanna move together, mention it again, but allow an open discussion. Do not shut out your partner right away. Example: *\"I'd like to discuss about the dog sleeping in the bed. For me, I'm not comfortable with the dog sleeping on the bed and I'd like to find a compromise\",*\n\nI hope it's easy to see what difference this makes. One of the main reasons why I'm saying YTA is the dogs age. The dog has slept in her bed for 9 years and he is a English Bulldog. That is very important, the age and the breed. You may ask why... **The average lifespan of a English Bulldog is 8 to 10 years old.** You're dealing with a very old day who still has the possibility to one day just go \"click\" and be in lots of distress due to the change. Sometimes there can be a delay until the dog reacts to it and for older dogs, too much stress can tip them over the edge.\n\nAnother reason is that you said it's not negiotable which imo is pretty bad considering it's a mutual relationship, you both need to talk. If your \"non-negiotable\" affects your partner more than you, it needs to be a discussion as mentioned above and not a \"I'm not going to discuss this with you, this is how it will be\". It's her dog, her place that she lives in you want to move in, so imo it needs to be discussion and not blatant \"No discussion allowed\".\n\nI urge you, please talk to your GF and explain to her why it makes you uncomfortable - don't resort to the \"In my opinion dogs shouldn't be in beds\", because I can tell you that she's not gonna take that well. Try to find reasons why you don't feel comfortable it, it's much better if you're able to say \"It makes me uncomfortable, because of...\" instead of \"Your dog can't sleep in the bed anymore\".\n\nHave an open discussion with her, try to find a middleground, don't just shut her out completely. This discussion should have happened already when you both started dating and getting serious, not only 2 years later when you want to move in. My dog sleeps in my bed and if I had a partner wait 2 years into our relationship to tell me this (my dog would then be 10+yrs), I'd break up, because for me it'd be important that it was mentioned in the beginning and allowed to have a proper discussion.\n\nEdit: And I do think her breaking up might be a real potential. So please talk to her, properly. Voice your concerns, genuine concerns and listen to hers. Be willing to find a middleground.", "NTA.  This is your 'hill to die on.' Stay firm and just say 'No.'  If you don't, you will grow to resent both the dog and your gf.  Explain how you feel in clear terms and let her decide if you are worth the compromise.  No, it won't hurt her dog.  In fact, it is probably getting really hard for him to get on the bed at his age.  Bulldogs can easily break their legs coming down from heights.", "YTA. LOL if you think the GF is going to pick you over the dog.  You never get between a dog person and their fur baby. Find yourself a partner that is compatible with you.", "NAH. Either you like or don't care if the dog sleeps in your bed or you hate it. Personally I don't care. If you make this your hill be prepared to rot on it though.", "YTA.", "YTA because you've been dating for a long time and you bring it up after years of being seemingly OK with it. You should've made your boundaries clear from the beginning.", "NTA but should have been honest along time ago", "The dog has offered a reasonable compromise of climbing into their bed only in the morning! OP would it help to get a heavy duty blanket to pull up each morning over what you actually sleep in so the bed itself stays clean of dog?", "YTA\nYou can sleep on the hard floor and the  elderly dog can have your spot in the bed. Win win for everyone.", "YTA you set the standard by allowing it and to suddenly change your mind no. also dogs are with us for their entire lives and only part of ours stop being an asshole and wash your damn sheets and dog. you knew the dog was there when you started dating your partner so", "Nta some people can get pretty annoying with dogs stand your ground trust me", "It\u2019s a dog\u2026. Why is that the bill you\u2019re wanting to die on here. If she\u2019s the one, her dog comes with her. You have to make compromises when moving in. And if her bed time routine includes a snuggle from piglet, welp.", "YTA. The dog has seniority.", "YTA, if this is trully a deal breaker for you then you'd have said it from the start. Now that you two are serious you want to make her choose between you and her dog? My dogs sleep in my bed and a guy that doesn't want it is a deal breaker for me, so I'd want to know if my bf has a problem with it before we are way too deep in our relationship.", "YTA  You are a con man.  Just sucker her in and let her think you agree to have her dog on the bed, but now that wasted the last two years with someone who is unwilling to reveal his true self.  What else haven't you told her?", "Everyone in the comments is once again delusional. You\u2019re not abusing an animal, you\u2019re suggestion that we put your human needs first. The dog learn to not sleep on the bed and will be perfectly fine.\n\nNTA.", "YTA. The dog should be allowed in the bed. Future animals after this one can be barred but it\u2019s not fair to the animal.", "NTA for having that boundary but she\u2019s going to pick the dog over you. Any reasonable dog owner would.", "YTA- and you probably made it a you or the dog situation since you said a dog in the bed was non-negotiable for you. I\u2019m willing to bet serious dating past the first time you slept over wouldn\u2019t have happened (let alone the convo of moving in) if she\u2019d know your view of dogs from the get go. Don\u2019t be surprised if your faced with the ultimatum of either the dog sleeps in the bed or you don\u2019t move in (possibly even break up).", "Let the dog sleep on the bed", "the dog lover in me is YTA lol. I half joke with my wife about us getting a dog and letting him sleep with us. She's the opposite and like no. Will see how that goes. to be honest though NTA/YTA each person feels differently.", "YTA.   \n\n\nMassive YTA for springing this onto your gf now instead of early in the relationship. Did you really so arrogant that you think you'd make your gf so blindly in love with you that you then can persuade your gf to kowtow to your not letting her dog sleeping in the dog? What an arrogant AH.   \nI hope your gf opens her eyes to your AH personality and dump you as she deserves a partner who love her and her dog, instead of a sneaky arrogant bastard like you.", "You know what happens when one partner wants the dog on the bed and the other doesn\u2019t? The dog gets in the bed. Because it\u2019s a dog.", "Yup. My 12 year old shih tzu has always slept on the bed, and that\u2019s not going to ever change", "Dog owner and dog lover here. OP is totally not wrong here. A dog can be just as happy on a.dog bed. And whereas humans shower every day and have pretty good hygiene... My dogs like to roll.in some pretty questionable things outdoors sometimes. As much as I try to clean them up, the don't bathe super often because that would strip their coat. For that reason only, dogs don't belong in a bed.\n\nStick to your guns OP.", "I was just going to say this. The pup is near the end of its lifespan, OP's dealt with this for 2.5 years, they can deal with it for a little longer.", "Which is fine, with a puppy raised that way. Introducing that to a 9 year old dog while technically doable will be confusing. And my dogs can sleep in my bed until the day they pass over the rainbow bridge. Your way isn't the only way.", "Agreed same thing happened to me. Moved in with bf who had a dog for several years that slept on the bed. Fast forward a couple years we move to a new place together and I made it clear dog on bed was not okay with me and non negotiable. \n\nAnd you know what, bf understood and dog has her own bed which is next to my bf\u2019s side of the bed that she sleeps on. Dog is living just fine not being on the bed. I don\u2019t understand the. Y T A", "Probably just skimmed milk at this point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s water lying about being milk\u201d", "It wouldn't be cruel. An old dog can indeed learn new tricks. Having a dog bed on the ground works just fine .it takes about a week to get used to and the pup will be fine. Dogs are smart and adaptable. They are made of porcelain", "When someone moves in you have to have a conversation redefining rules because you are bringing in another person and making it their space. So him bringing it up even if it's him moving in with her is valid since it's not her space any more it's their space. \n\nStill the dog is also a member of the house hold and elderly one at that. They aren't going to retrain him to not sleep in the bed and it be a certain level of cruel to attempt to do so."]}
