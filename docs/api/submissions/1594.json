Mainly due to your lack of communication early on.  You pretended to be ok with the dog sleeping on the bed and now all of a sudden its \"non-negotiable\" and gross. You can't just spring this on her and give ultimatums. I have a feeling this will not go your way.", "YTA\n\nYou went along with a dog\u2019s behavior for several years, kept quiet, and now that you\u2019re moving in, you call the behavior a deal breaker? If it was a deal breaker, you should have let her know before this so she could decide whether time spent on you was worth it.\n\nYou betrayed your GF\u2019s trust here. Known deal breakers aren\u2019t something you hide for 2 and a half years.", "YTA for this reason only: you waited until you were at the MOVING IN TOGETHER STAGE before discussing your non-negotiables. \n\nThis is like\u2026 third date material. Waiting until you have someone \u201ctrapped\u201d to reveal you aren\u2019t all that compatible is shitty, and a big waste of everyone\u2019s time. \n\nThe fact that this was a non-negotiable but you \u201cput up with it\u201d until you were closer is even shittier. Just tell the truth.", "YTA. That dog is already grandfathered in as far as sleeping on the bed goes. Sadly he's probably toward the end of his days so there is no reason to change it. This is a take it or leave it deal for you.\n\nIn the future if you two end up getting another dog this can be renegotiated. But this is already a done deal.", "NAH. The dog is old and accustomed to this. 9 is pretty senior and you already have him not on the bed when you\u2019re in it. Get a dog blanket for the bed if it bothers you this much.", "NAH...

You said it yourself, the dog is a big part of her life.\n\nI think you\u2019ll need to learn to adjust having 4-legged company near you while you sleep. If it\u2019s a sanitary issue, get baby wipes. Wipe the toosh free of dingleberries and wipe the paws every night before the dog gets into bed. And trust me when I say in the 5 or so years when that dog passes, you\u2019re going to want their company and regret not letting him/her up on the bed at night.

That's basically telling her \"kick your old beloved dog out of bed or we can't live together\" which is a pretty crappy move.\n\nYou should have shared your opinions before this point and now you've basically given her an ultimatum that personally???

Not fuckin cool\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had my oldest dog about the same time she\u2019s had hers. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep soundly kicking him out of the bed like that all of a sudden. If I was with someone who didn\u2019t want him in the bed, I\u2019d want to dump them pretty quickly before feelings started.

I actually think it\u2019s a great compromise that the dog doesn\u2019t sleep on the bed at night but can hop up in the morning.  You knew what you were getting into.  Going into the discussion telling her it\u2019s a non negotiable (when it\u2019s such a minor thing) isn\u2019t the way you communicate and resolve differences in a relationship. \n\nNAH for disagreeing about whether dogs should sleep on the bed or not in general.", "Yta. I hate sleeping in bed with my husband's puggo. Puggo is great puggo is awesome. Puggo also has this super power where he can increase his gravitational pull if you need him to move so you can shift your body. I have arthritis and need to shift often in my sleep. My dog feels my toe twitch and will get off the bed or couch and is 5x the size of puggo. Puggo turns from 20lbs of dead weight to 300 if you need to move. But puggo also came before me and I refuse to kick him out of the bed even if that means waking up 4-6x in a night to move the little asshole from where he wedged between my legs in the most uncomfortable position.", "YTA\n\nYou should have spoken up way up front. You get to have your boundaries but the ship sailed on this one. \n\nFor me, this would be a relationship ending thing. My dog prefers to be near us while sleeping and I prefer him close too.

Hope she leaves you", "YTA - not for having that boundary, but for choosing not to voice it until now. You've been dating for 2 years, and never mentioned this? This is clearly part of her dog's routine and is pretty normal for them, it will be quite hard for her to train him out of it. But suddenly now, when you start to think about moving in, it becomes a non-negotiable rule? Dude, I'd be mad if I were her. Regardless of intent, it comes off as you being needlessly controlling. \n\nRethink if this is actually non-negotiable for you here.  Your GF has lived with her dog for years, she's just now starting to consider living with you.", "YTA the dog has a routine and you want to break that.

Dogs can be trained to sleep on a dog bed beside the bed, but it takes work. I googled the lifespan of the breed it says 8-10 years usually. You said this was not negotiable. It is up to you of course, but I would maybe let it slide for this dog only, No other pets will sleep in the bed ever.\n\nI would hate to share a bed with a dog too.

I've owned cats since I was a teenager and none of the above has ever made a dent in how much I love having a pet cuddled up next to me each night. Someone coming along and telling me after 2+ years that I need to change that because they aren't a fan of pets on a bed hasn't got a hope in hell!", "When I started staying at my bf\u2019s with my dog (little chihuahua mix) he said he didn\u2019t want my dog to sleep on the bed. Throughout the time of me coming over with dog and me trying to keep dog off, he realized it was really hard to teach a dog that was accustomed to sleeping on them to no to. As our relationship got stronger so did his with my dog. He now invites her onto his lap when he\u2019s gaming and makes a little pocket under the sheets for her. I\u2019ve also woken up to times of her snuggling with him more than me cause I move a lot. 1 year ago we got a puppy that would be our dog, but gonna be referred to as his dog. BF did not shy from introducing his dog to sleeping on the bed and now sleeps with both dogs on the bed cuddling up to him even though his dog is now a medium sized. \n\nMy point being is that it\u2019s insane to me that OP has never brought this up before or with the time of spending time and putting up with dog on bed, hasn\u2019t changed his stance. Bringing this up as they are talking of moving into together 2 years later is an asshole move. YTA.", "not even iranian yogurt", "You are absolutely right on the money. Any man who wants to share my bed with me can expect to also share it with my hundred-pound dog. If he doesn't like it, there's the couch. \n\nShe's been sleeping with me since she was a tiny puppy and that's not going to change. \n\nHe should've definitely told his girlfriend about his feelings sooner. She probably would've told him to hit the road, but instead, he wanted to not say anything until he felt more secure about it. Not cool. \n\nI have to vote YTA for OP. This whole mess could've been avoided for everyone involved if he discussed this with her much sooner.", "Iranian yogurt strikes again!!\ud83d\ude02", "YTA for trying to trap this girl. Makes me think you\u2019ve tried to change girls to please yourself before and have learned to wait until later to do this.", "YTA.   Your so-called deal breaker should have been an immediate end to this 2.5 yrs ago.   Why lead her on for this long and then try and enforce this?", "YTA, because the dog was in the bed first. If you don\u2019t like the arrangement she has with her dog then maybe you should find a different girlfriend", "YTA\n\nYou missed an opportunity to point out that you don't like it a long time ago. After 2.5 years you will find it very hard to change it, honestly your girlfriend is more likely to change/replace you than her dog's habit. And it's your fault, not your girlfriend and her dog. (Edit: typo)", "The fact that you lied for years about something that is a deal breaker for you and decide to bring it up now that you've developed a serious relationship with ur partner makes you TA. So YTA. You should be honest about your standards since the start so both you and your partner could either find a compromise about it EARLY ON or understand you're probably not going to agree on this and eventually decide if you wanna go your seperate ways. But waiting for years to speak about this and making it a problem all of a sudden is a huge AH move.", "YTA - not because you don\u2019t want the dog in the bed but because you make it a \u201cnon negotiable\u201d. After 9 years it is difficult to get the dog used to a different behaviour. She might also think that he doesn\u2019t have so much more time left and she doesn\u2019t want to break a strong bond with her dog. If you were ok with it before which makes it even more confusing for the dog. You should start to communicate with her and try together if you could train her dog to stay down. A dog can be trained to stay down but it isn\u2019t easy and it will require her to stay firm on that with her dog which is the most difficult part.\nEdit: you can try to get a new bed - makes it easier for the dog understand that this is a different situation.", "NAH. But if it\u2019s a dealbreaker you better both be sure you are on the same page or move on.", "YTA", "YTA. Dogs are the best!", "Get a bigger bed", "YTA and a shitty fucking person", "Soft YTA. If this was so important to you, you should have voiced your opinion much earlier. Also, and I don\u2019t mean this to be harsh I couldn\u2019t think of a better way to phrase it, you need to adjust your attitude. Referring to the dog as \u201cit\u201d speaks volumes. Pets are family, not things.", "The dog has 7 years worth of seniority over you, my dude, you won't win this one nor should you. YTA.", "YTA for waiting this long to lay that out. Also, the dog was there first :)", "NAH. It's a dealbreaker for you and it's most likely a dealbreaker for her, so the solution is waiting a few years to move in together.", "NAH. I wouldn\u2019t want to sleep with the dog either. But since it\u2019s 9 years old I\u2019m not sure that can be changed at this point.", "My husband really doesn't like animals in bed. The solution? I have a king size bed and all 3 dogs sleep with me. Husband has his own room. Everybody is happy...and I'm a little jealous because I think he gets a better night's sleep lol. NAH, but you may want to discuss getting a 2 bedroom and have your own space. Having differing views doesn't have to mean the end of the relationship...just may have to do things differently.", "Nta, it\u2019s your flat, your rules about hygene expectations... You should have mentioned the issue before, for sure, but as you were in her house you were practically just following her rules.", "NAH that\u2019s nasty", "NTA for your opinion and feelings on the issue but you are TA for not broaching the subject earlier in your relationship. Also in regards to your request, I'd just go find a different gf since you're not going to win over her dog.", "When I was single my dog slept in the bed with me, but when my now husband and I started dating there simply wasn\u2019t enough room for two humans and a large dog, so he sleeps on a bed next to ours, but, like your GFs dog, he still comes up for morning cuddles. If the dog is regularly bathed, I feel like this is a really good compromise.", "NTA but the best part of having a dog is the in bed heater and snuggles.  I made is 2 weeks kicking my dog out of the bed before I missed him to much and let him back in.", "He went along with it because that\u2019s her place. You can\u2019t tell someone what to do in their place you accept it", "Agreed. My dogs rank higher than most people lol", "No but you can tell them how you feel and that while you\u2019re ok with it for this dog, in the long term it\u2019s a deal breaker. Deal breakers should never be kept secret. That only pushes the issues down the road until you have a much bigger commitment to each other and you realize you aren\u2019t actually compatible", "He very easily could've said he wasn't comfortable with dogs in the bed early on. Don't say it's a deal breaker, just say you're uncomfortable with it and go from there.", "I think we would all expect him to have the self-awareness to realize that they aren't compatible. He admits that he's \"never been a fan\" of allowing dogs onto the bed, but she clearly enjoys having her dog close. He decided to pretend to be okay with it for two years, then try to enforce new rules once they were talking about moving in together. The time to bring this up was *way* before now.", "What else has he been lying about?", "I interpreted it as him not saying anything previously because it was her space. now since its a shared space (that is also his) it seems like an appropriate time to bring it up", "Why is he an asshole to discuss it when they are moving in together?  I don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t say something right away but since he doesn\u2019t want it happening, why should he have kept silent about it?  This is a big issue that needs to be worked out. They may not be compatible enough and better to find out before they try living together.", "They already have a dog bed. And the dig is 9 years old. He's been getting on the bed his entire life, it would be cruel to now suddenly tell him he can't. The dog wouldn't understand.", "He\u2019s an asshole for waiting 2.5 years to have this conversation. He\u2019s known this was going to be an issue for a very long time and didn\u2019t have the maturity to address it until now. It\u2019s a lot easier to end a relationship after 6 months when you realize your animal preferences aren\u2019t compatible compared to 2.5 years."]}
