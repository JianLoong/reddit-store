But this isn\u2019t a fight you\u2019re going to win. Someone who told me my 9 year old dog can\u2019t sleep in my bed anymore is someone who wouldn\u2019t find themselves in my bed anymore.", "YTA my man. Mainly due to your lack of communication early on.  You pretended to be ok with the dog sleeping on the bed and now all of a sudden its \"non-negotiable\" and gross. You can't just spring this on her and give ultimatums. I have a feeling this will not go your way.", "YTA\n\nYou went along with a dog\u2019s behavior for several years, kept quiet, and now that you\u2019re moving in, you call the behavior a deal breaker? If it was a deal breaker, you should have let her know before this so she could decide whether time spent on you was worth it.\n\nYou betrayed your GF\u2019s trust here. Known deal breakers aren\u2019t something you hide for 2 and a half years.", "YTA for this reason only: you waited until you were at the MOVING IN TOGETHER STAGE before discussing your non-negotiables. \n\nThis is like\u2026 third date material. Waiting until you have someone \u201ctrapped\u201d to reveal you aren\u2019t all that compatible is shitty, and a big waste of everyone\u2019s time. \n\nThe fact that this was a non-negotiable but you \u201cput up with it\u201d until you were closer is even shittier. Just tell the truth.", "YTA. That dog is already grandfathered in as far as sleeping on the bed goes. Sadly he's probably toward the end of his days so there is no reason to change it. This is a take it or leave it deal for you.\n\nIn the future if you two end up getting another dog this can be renegotiated. But this is already a done deal.", "NAH. The dog is old and accustomed to this. 9 is pretty senior and you already have him not on the bed when you\u2019re in it. Get a dog blanket for the bed if it bothers you this much.", "NAH...  It's a package deal... Take it or leave it..", "YTA.  Also, I'd be very cautious delivering ultimatums about the dog.  You may find you don't rate quite as highly as you'd like.", "YTA for this part: \"I\u2019ve never been a fan of dogs sleeping on the bed, but decided to not bring it up since it was a new relationship and I didn\u2019t want that to ruin anything early on.\" You lied by omission. You were dishonest. Ask yourself what else you're hiding and planning on springing after you've moved in and have your gf \"trapped\"? You sound like a big red flag.", "No assholes but she would be stupid to move in with you or to let you move in with her.", "YTA, that dog has been there for her longer than you have. Referring to the puppy as \u201cit\u201d, tells me what kind of human you are. The Make or break of this relationship is *dog wants to sleep with owner as it has the past 9 yrs, but I\u2019ve pretended it\u2019s ok for 2.5yrs* pathetic dude.", "YTA. This dog has been in your girl\u2019s bed for the past 9 years (assuming she got him as a puppy) and now you want to come and change that? No, dude. You can\u2019t mess with that dynamic. You said it yourself, the dog is a big part of her life.\n\nI think you\u2019ll need to learn to adjust having 4-legged company near you while you sleep. If it\u2019s a sanitary issue, get baby wipes. Wipe the toosh free of dingleberries and wipe the paws every night before the dog gets into bed. And trust me when I say in the 5 or so years when that dog passes, you\u2019re going to want their company and regret not letting him/her up on the bed at night. Don\u2019t let this little thing bother you. Dogs aren\u2019t here forever so enjoy the lil dude or dudette\u2019s company while you can.", "NAH. However, if you\u2019re both set in your ways (I know my current dog will forever be allowed in my bed) then maybe moving in right now isn\u2019t the best idea.", "NAH but you\u2019re not going to win this battle.

Sorry but you can't just give an ultimatum unless you're ready to lose. Ask yourself this: Is she worth it or not? Therein lies your answer.", "YTA. I understand you don't like it, but you could always train your next dog to not sleep on the bed, but this one is going to be confused when all of a sudden he's not allowed to. My ex-boyfriend did the same thing to my dog and my dog is still wary about jumping up on my bed because of him.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to wait until the moving in together stage of a relationship to make her choose you over her routine with a dog that completely predates you. That's basically telling her \"kick your old beloved dog out of bed or we can't live together\" which is a pretty crappy move.\n\nYou should have shared your opinions before this point and now you've basically given her an ultimatum that personally??? I'd choose my dog. Sorry not sorry.", "A 9 year old British bulldog is near the end of their lifespan, what's happening now regarding him/her getting on the bed in the morning  is a good compromise. Don't choose this hill to die on, because if you do, you may find yourself uninvited to move in. YTA if you continue along with this", "YTA first of all for calling the dog, \u201cit\u201d. Doesn\u2019t sound like you like the dog very much if you\u2019re talking that way.\n\nSecondly, as far as she knows, you\u2019ve been totally fine with the dog in the bed for two years and now all of a sudden it\u2019s a deal-breaker? Not fuckin cool\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had my oldest dog about the same time she\u2019s had hers. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep soundly kicking him out of the bed like that all of a sudden. If I was with someone who didn\u2019t want him in the bed, I\u2019d want to dump them pretty quickly before feelings started. To wait until 2 years into the relationship to make that revelation is just really fucking shitty.", "Well, start sleeping alone OP. YTA for not saying anything immediately. She would\u2019ve moved on from you and found a dog lover instead she might have to be miserable because you don\u2019t want the dog on the bed.", "YTA. I actually think it\u2019s a great compromise that the dog doesn\u2019t sleep on the bed at night but can hop up in the morning.  You knew what you were getting into.  Going into the discussion telling her it\u2019s a non negotiable (when it\u2019s such a minor thing) isn\u2019t the way you communicate and resolve differences in a relationship. \n\nNAH for disagreeing about whether dogs should sleep on the bed or not in general.", "Yta. I hate sleeping in bed with my husband's puggo. Puggo is great puggo is awesome. Puggo also has this super power where he can increase his gravitational pull if you need him to move so you can shift your body. I have arthritis and need to shift often in my sleep. My dog feels my toe twitch and will get off the bed or couch and is 5x the size of puggo. Puggo turns from 20lbs of dead weight to 300 if you need to move. But puggo also came before me and I refuse to kick him out of the bed even if that means waking up 4-6x in a night to move the little asshole from where he wedged between my legs in the most uncomfortable position.", "YTA\n\nYou should have spoken up way up front. You get to have your boundaries but the ship sailed on this one. \n\nFor me, this would be a relationship ending thing. My dog prefers to be near us while sleeping and I prefer him close too. It\u2019s a comfort. \n\nI literally would not think of being in a relationship with someone who had a problem with my doggo.", "YTA for all the reasons already mentioned.", "INFO: Why does it bother you so much?", "Yta for having this be a deal breaker and acting like it\u2019s not for TWO YEARS and then springing this on her when you guys want to live together.", "YTA not because you don\u2019t want the dog on the bed but because you waited two and a half years to bring it up. Maybe if she\u2019d known at the start that was non-negotiable for you, she would have chosen a different path. When your dog is really important to you, this type of thing can be a deal breaker.", "YTA", "NTA. But be careful, she is the dog\u2019s mother right now and you\u2019d be drawing a line in the sand about bigger things. I suggest you lose this one (even if gross) and learn to sleep in a slobbery bed.", "YTA you\u2019re an asshole. Dogs don\u2019t live long enough. Hope she leaves you", "YTA - not for having that boundary, but for choosing not to voice it until now. You've been dating for 2 years, and never mentioned this? This is clearly part of her dog's routine and is pretty normal for them, it will be quite hard for her to train him out of it. But suddenly now, when you start to think about moving in, it becomes a non-negotiable rule? Dude, I'd be mad if I were her. Regardless of intent, it comes off as you being needlessly controlling. \n\nRethink if this is actually non-negotiable for you here.  Your GF has lived with her dog for years, she's just now starting to consider living with you.", "YTA the dog has a routine and you want to break that. Don\u2019t be surprised when the dog chews your shoes or otherwise gets his revenge because you are changing his routine. \nGet over it dog has always slept in the bed, if you change that when you move in YTA.", "I would say no assholes here if this was the start of a new relationship and you two were just discovering this deal-breaker, but you've known for two years that you don't want the dog in the bed and that it was a deal breaker for you and you waited for 2 years to tell her that means YTA.", "YTA. This idea that pets don\u2019t \u201cbelong\u201d on furniture is outdated. Your GF and her dog are a package deal, so make your choice.", "YTA but just a little bit. Let her have her dog when she wakes up.", "YTA. A good compromise is exactly what\u2019s happening. The dog gets up on the bed in the morning but not when sleeping. Although it would be good to make clear that any future dogs are not allowed on the bed.", "INFO-\n\n>Now that we are talking about moving in,\n\nMoving into her place, or your place, or another place?", "NTA I am sure the dog would rather sleep on the bed though. Dogs can be trained to sleep on a dog bed beside the bed, but it takes work. I googled the lifespan of the breed it says 8-10 years usually. You said this was not negotiable. It is up to you of course, but I would maybe let it slide for this dog only, No other pets will sleep in the bed ever.\n\nI would hate to share a bed with a dog too. It is such an old dog though seems sad to change things now.", "NAH but maybe she should get her own bed and you can visit in the morning", "NAH.\n\nThe dog is getting older now, it won\u2019t be long and it won\u2019t be able to get up on the bed without assistance.\n\nThe dog has a bed of its own and is using it by choice.\n\nI think you need to come to a compromise.", "This is going to be tough.\n\n>a betrayal of the dog\u2019s trust.\n\nI wouldn't put it like that, but it is what dogs do, naturally. They sleep in a room together, with body contact.\n\nMaybe she feels betrayed, because you had accepted the dog at first, and now you are refusing it.\n\nYou have a right to your own bed, and to set boundaries regarding who can sleep in it.\n\nSo, in my book, you are NTA.\n\nBut she may feel differently.", "NAH. It sounds like a non-negotiable for both of you. One of you has to cave. \n\nFWIW, it\u2019s weird to me to call it a betrayal of a dog\u2019s trust not to let it on the bed in the morning.

However, I think it\u2019s safe to assume your girlfriend will want more pets in the future. You both need to start discussing what you want that to look like now. Personally, I don\u2019t think there is a right or wrong answer on this one, but you both will need to decide. Our dogs are allowed both on the couch and in bed, but sometimes I like more personal space, so I tell them off.
