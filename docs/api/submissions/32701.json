She learned to go to authorities first, and when nothing is done, you put the heat on high and let the pot boil over.", "NTA. Fuck that kid.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nIf your neighbor steals your lawn chair, and you respond by going over and punching him in the fact, you're at least as much of a criminal as he is. \n\nYour shitty life lessons are making it more likely your daughter will end up in jail.", "YTA\n\nYou're teaching a 3 year old it's okay to resort to violence... let that sink in. \n\nYour kid comes home with a bruise on their temple. Tell me you don't see red. Very dangerous place to get hit and you either don't understand that or don't care.", "I'm all about teaching my daughters to defend themselves if they need to. \n\nBut not over a toy. Come on man. Violence is NOT the correct answer to another (probably troubled) child taking toys.\n\nYTA here. You should read some books on parenting.", "NTA. I always went to a teacher \u2026. For 6 years before I got into a fight because clearly no one else was going to do anything about it. You should however tell her that she should try non violent manes of getting it back first. Like asking the child.", "YTA, sticking up for yourself does NOT mean physically assaulting someone. If she\u2019d just taken the toy back fine but damn lady, just no. What you\u2019re teaching you kid is going to wind up with her behind bars.", "YTA buddy\n\nYou're teaching her to go from 0 to 100 in a split second. Where was the deescalation? Ideally, you should be teaching her to assert herself and advocate for herself verbally instead of lashing out physically.\n\nA \"That's mine, give it back,\" would have been a good place to start at. Appealing to the system, even if the system didn't work, should be next, if for nothing than as a CYA. Presenting a united front with the others whom this kid has been mean to to prevent her from gaining the upper hand in a one-on-one interaction might also be an idea. Bringing you in as the person who knows what strings to pull with and whom to approach at which part of the system is what you should be encouraging. \n\nPhysical violence needs to be the last resort and only for defending oneself or others from someone being violent towards them.", "YTA - She didn't defend herself, she hit another kid hard enough to bruise for taking a toy. There are situations that require self-defense, this isn't anywhere near any of them, doesn't matter how many times the toy is taken. It's a toy! It's a child's play thing! What you're actually doing is setting the precedent that violence is an acceptable solution to problems. That's the kind of seed that grows into something ugly and you seem determined to keep watering it.", "YTA.  You're teaching your daughter to hit other children.  That may come back to haunt you later.", "YTA is this rage bait? Three year olds take things from other kids - all the time - and three year olds hit - not infrequently - and then they learn not to hit and other methods that are better for solving problems. The learn not to take things without asking and how to not hit because adults TEACH them. No, you shouldn\u2019t yell at your daughter - how is that the only other option? \n\nWatch out or soon your kid will be labeled the \u201cmean\u201d one by other parents - which side not wtf they are THREE. That\u2019s so gross that parents would gossip and label them like that.", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH. What I would do is sit down with your daughter and explain that teachers and parents usually don\u2019t like it when you resort to violence, and while it may seem justified, she\u2019s very likely to get in trouble from it. If you can help her understand that if she keeps going to the teacher about it, if the girl keeps doing it the teacher will talk to her parents and try to stop the issue entirely.", "YTA\n\nthis is not how you deal with problems. If you have a problem then speak to the teacher about your concerns, but encouraging toddlers to fight is not the right way to go about it. They are toddlers, and they are learning so their behaviour will not be perfect, and i'm not saying ignore the behaviour. There needs to be consequences, but telling your daughter to fight another toddler is not how you deal with problems and the fact you are a grown adult getting fixated on getting back at a toddler is innapropriate and a little bit unsettling", "A little bit AH.\n\nCorrect, your daughter should always stand up for herself when the system fails. In the first case, the system did not fail. In the second case, **the system did not get a chance to act**. What she learned is less about justice and more about vigilantism.\n\nI wouldn't yell at my kid for this either, but I'd have a discussion with them about escalation, and how to properly go about it.\n\nI'm sure the temple clap was great, but I would have liked to see it come out only if she first approached a teacher and the teacher failed to help.\n\nNo apologies should be made to the parents. You don't need to make them your enemies or best friends, either.", "YTA.  You are teetering in the blink of teaching your daughter that violence is an acceptable first resort for situations like this, rather than a last resort.", "NTA Good for you and your kid! She did the right thing to go to the teacher first. The other girl should have been removed from the school permanently since this seems to be an ongoing situation.", "I'm fine with your daughter defending herself, but YTA.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies here: \"I\u2019m also glad my daughter figured out at a young age that authority/teachers won\u2019t help. You need to take control of the situation on your own.\"\n\nYou didn't even give the teacher a chance to resolve the situation. The first time this happened, the teacher got her toy back and warned the other girl.\n\nSo, the next day, your daughter doesn't even bother to go to the teacher, and you're saying that \"authority/teachers won't help.\"\n\nHow do you know? The teacher gave the other girl a warning. So, give the teacher a chance to follow through with the promised consequences.", "NTA\n\nThere will always be a kid meaner, stronger and more potent. Your daughter figured out that if the other child won't listen to the teacher then she will face up with your child. \n\nAlso - everyone saying that she must've hit hard enough to leave a bruise, your temple area is very delicate anyway - a toy hitting that area will make it bruise. Also- we have no idea if this child easily bruises. \n\nShe learned that she shouldn't yank toys from others. Sucks for the other kid but I'm teaching my kids that they will defend themselves.", "NTA.\n\nIn nursery school, children's job is to learn how to interact with other children, playing, sharing, self-defending, choosing when to go to teachers or not, and so on. And the parents' job is mostly to step back and watch unless serious damage is being done.", "YTA this is exactly the reason most daycares/preschools discourage taking toys. These are 3 year old toddlers, they don't understand the  nuances of sharing and ownership well. You are lucky your daughter didn't get kicked out.", "YTA. She\u2019s 3. She doesn\u2019t understand nuance between standing up for herself, and thinking it\u2019s ok to just whack people in the temple. \n\nShe stood up for herself the first time by going to the teacher. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think your daughter needs to be punished per se, and definitely not yelled at\u2026but you, as her parent, have an obligation to teach her that throwing hands is unacceptable.", "Something WAS done the first time. This was the correct way to go about it.\n\nThe second time, she didn't go to the authorities. So your \"go to authorities first, and when nothing is done, you put the heat on high\" is invalid.", "Unfortunately in many cases like this, the kid who defended themselves gets kicked out of the pre school, because usually the other kid ends up getting more hurt.", "My daughter tried everything already. The second time the teacher spoke to the parents, but this situation still happened. It could be very possible that the other kid found my daughters reaction amusing when she got her toy taken.\n\nObviously I wouldn\u2019t encourage my daughter to use violence right off the bat, but in this situation there seemed to be no other options.", "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking. I updated my post, but basically this is the third time this situation happened. My son went to the teacher multiple times but it resolved nothing.", "not to mention the girls were 3. There is no reason op should have such intense feelings over a toddler. I would be quite concerned if someone felt so strongly about my child that way and I had a child that age to.", "not to mention the toddlers are 3. There is no reason to feel such anger over a  3 year old at his age. I'm not trying to be rude to op. I just think it is a little bit concerning that op is getting this invested in getting back at a toddler over stealing a toy once. If op was mad at the situation and this was a repeated behaviour that was nothing done about it then his anger should be placed at the staff and the parents, not a toddler. I am also very concerned if he seriously encourages violence towards small children aswell. The fact that he felt this level of anger towards a 3 year old concerned me a little bit.", "Haunt how exactly?", "This is the third time the situation happened. The adults clearly weren\u2019t helping. I updated my post, and my wife is the one who told me all this, since she picks her up most of the time.", "I edited my post to clarify some comments.", "I honestly have no way to tell if anything happened in between. The first time the situation happened was exactly a week ago. I heard about this happening today, but I\u2019m unsure if the same situation happened multiple times. \n\nI guess I let it slide because my son (6M) went through something similar, except he went to the teacher multiple times. I just assumed the same thing happened this time.", "the fact that a grown adult in their 30s is getting upset and fixated on a 3 year old is a bit unsettling aswell. I had to look over at the ages twice because I was shocked that op was having such feelings over a 3 year old.", "Why would I discourage my daughter from taking her toy just so that other kids don\u2019t feel left out? That\u2019s something which needs to be fixed between that child and their parent.", "This. You're teaching your THREE YEAR OLD that violence is an appropriate reaction to a situation.", "Going to the teacher isn\u2019t standing up for yourself. Standing up is directly confronting the person. I also don\u2019t think three year olds can do that much damage, so I\u2019m not concerned.\n\nThis is the same attitude that conditions children to constantly seek out teachers, and the teachers usually don\u2019t help at all. Later on, in elementary school, the kid becomes an easier target because they didn\u2019t defend themselves.", "I edited my post to clarify if I was unsure whether something happened in between, since the first situation happened a week ago.", "Yeah, but at least this baby child took the appropriate action before escalating. Most children don't have even the slightest comprehension other than attack or whine", "Ejected from school, criminal charges...  She left a bruise on a child's temple?  That's insanely dangerous.", "Thanks for the update. I wouldn't change my vote much, but it would be worth understanding more of the situation. At this age they are sorting out their morality.\n\nAs adults, we can only legally attack in grave situations, and only as a last resort.\n\nI'd love to break into my neighbor's place and take a bat to his Dolby Digital surround sound. Alas, I can only file noise complaints with management - if nothing happens, maybe I can sue the management or move out.\n\nIts an extreme scenario, but I'm trying to amplify the nuances of escalation and means-of-last resorts.\n\nFor me, I couldn't care less about the other parents - but I'd want my child to have a sophisticated view of morality and justice :)", "You clearly decided that you had been in the right. Why did you even come here to ask?", "She\u2019s THREE. \n\nHer toy was taken, and your daughter hit a kid so hard she bruised.", "Your daughter will eventually be able to do damage. If you're thinking about this in future tense, which you are, think about your child getting into a fight in grade 6, or 10, or in college. \n\nThis is why you need to teach children these things about violence now. Doesn't seem like you want to take advice though, and just want to defend lazy parenting.", "MaInly for advice. I\u2019ve heard nasty stories from relatives and friends about bullying and what not, so I\u2019m just setting my kids in a position where they don\u2019t get bullied in the first place.\n\nMost people say use words, go to a teacher, etc. Many times that just makes it worst for the kid. To deter bullies, violence is the best solution. It\u2019s even better if people know that one is capable of violence, so that they don\u2019t go at them in the first place.", "So if my daughter is in middle school and someone tries to pick on her, she should go to the teacher or use her words? It\u2019s not unknown that bullies don\u2019t stop unless you physically hit back, and that 90% of the time the teachers or adults don\u2019t do anything. That\u2019s why I told my daughter it\u2019s fine considering this is the third time this happened.\n\nIn the off chance thay they actually do intervene, now the kid has earned the reputation of being \u201cweak\u201d and a tattle tale.", "Yes. Your daughter should use her words. \n\nHow about at work? Do you get into physical altercations much? I don't know what world you live in, but if you start hitting people you're gonna go to jail.", "Work and kids on a playground are too different things. The goal is to set up my kids to be in a situation where they don\u2019t get picked on in the first place. If you have the reputation of someone who doesn\u2019t hit back, then life will be hell for you.\n\nMy daughter reacting to a situation after 3 times with violence isn\u2019t setting herself up to end up in jail. She learned the proper way to respond to bullies.", "You're setting your daughter up to respond later on in life with violence. If this is how she continues to do things, it'll become a pattern. The same way that children who are constantly yelled at, learn to only respond to yelling.\n\nEdit: not only this, but children who get into fights or physical altercations are usually treated differently in schools. Have an educational assistant around them, and are under a microscope. Half the time children that behave that way, get in trouble before they actually do something wrong. \n\nAs someone who has worked with children from 0-18 years old for his whole professional career, I'm telling you, this isn't something to celebrate."]}
