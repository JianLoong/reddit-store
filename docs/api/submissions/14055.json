{"id": 14055, "submission_id": "12clbpl", "title": "AITA for being upset with my friend for choosing her son\u2019s baptism instead of my wedding?", "selftext": "I (F32) have a lifelong \u201cBFF\u201d (F32) - she and I have gone through all of life\u2019s ups and downs and still remained dear friends.\n\nAlmost three years ago I got engaged to my fianc\u00e9 (M34) - we wanted to have a big party and because of Covid (my fianc\u00e9 is an expat) we decided to wait to get married until 2023. We settled on a date in April \u201822.\n\nBFF since met her amazing boyfriend & she\u2019s just given birth to their beautiful son here in February. He is healthy and an amazing little guy-  I love him to bits.\n\nLast week BFF invited me to his baptism and told me some news - they\u2019ve chosen to have their son baptised the day before my wedding (so the baptism is on a Friday, my wedding on a Saturday) and she was \u201cpretty sure that she wasn\u2019t going to make it to my wedding because she will be too tired.\u201d\n\nIn the moment I could only focus on telling her that I was looking forward to the baptism, so I didn\u2019t mention anything about her not coming to my wedding. Since then I have stewed it over a bit and the more I think about it, the more I realise that I\u2019m actually very hurt by what I feel is a belittling of my \u201clife event\u201d. \n\nI am not a parent myself, so I am sure that there are some unwritten rules for parenthood that take precedence over friendship & I understand that they could have chosen that particular date for sentimental reasons. However, I feel like she could have made arrangements with her boyfriend for the day after & that they could have planned better. I feel like she views my wedding as insignificant compared to their baptism, even though both events are important happenings in our respective lives. I feel like she\u2019s using her son\u2019s baptism as a bad excuse or she\u2019s struggling with something and isn\u2019t telling me about it - and it sucks that she hasn\u2019t thought of this.\n\nI have asked for advice from some of my friends, on whether or not I should bring this up to her and most have outright told me that it\u2019s wrong of me to even want to bring up to my friend that I would like to see her on my wedding day even if she is tired.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting to bring it up to her that I\u2019m disappointed that she\u2019s dropping out of my wedding, because her son\u2019s baptism is the day before? That I\u2019m hurt that it feels like I am supporting/showing up to her life and her major events, but she doesn\u2019t support/showing up to mine?\n\nTL;DR:\nMy best friend since childhood scheduled her son\u2019s baptism the day before my wedding and is now pulling out of said wedding because she\u2019ll be too tired after the baptism. I am hurt because she\u2019s known about the wedding longer than she\u2019s been pregnant. AITA for wanting to tell her that I\u2019ll be hurt and disappointed if she doesn\u2019t show up?\n\nEdit: Just to add, I have already been called an asshole by my other friends, for even thinking about bringing it up which is why I don\u2019t know if I even should be mad/upset about this.\n\nSecond edit: \nI think I should have added that the wedding isn\u2019t until first weekend of July - I would not expect her to be ready for a baptism this fast, much less a whole day event like a wedding (which I don\u2019t expect her to attend the entirety of). \n\nWe have also gone to great lengths to make the first part of our wedding child-friendly (the ceremony and the reception) since we are in our early 30\u2019s and have many friends that are either pregnant, parents to newborns and toddlers or people who just have children. Our friends have been encouraged to bring their children so they don\u2019t have to worry about finding a sitter.", "created_utc": 1680703221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12clbpl/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_friend_for_choosing/", "score": 1515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which she planned after already knowing your wedding was the next day. Sounds like she is using her child as an excuse to getting out of your wedding.", "NTA. I don't think it's too much to ask for a lifelong friend to attend your wedding. Further, you scheduled your wedding well in advance of her child's baptism. It seems like she's using it as an excuse to not attend your wedding but still wants you to attend her kid's baptism?\n\nShe sounds super selfish. I know for a damn fact that baptisms have a lot more flexibility in scheduling than weddings. She could have chosen a different date.\n\nUltimately, it's her right to not attend your wedding, but that doesn't mean you can't have hurt feelings. I would tell her your feelings and see if she'll change her mind. If not, she definitely sucks.", "NTA.  I cant quite understand being so exhausted from a baptism that she couldn\u2019t attend your wedding.  I can see her not staying long but to not come at all seems strange to me.  In the end, her scheduling is her decision and her not coming to your wedding is her decision also.  But I can understand your being hurt.", "Honestly I wouldn't go. Just tell her with your wedding the next day you will be too busy and want to be well rested for your event. Wish her well and tell her she will be missed on your big day and then just let it all go. People change. Priorities change. No one has to be as excited as you for your own life events. The timing is definitely suspicious but like I said before I would just let it go. And definitely don't go to the baptism.", "NTA- she\u2019s not even busy the day of just the day before. Don\u2019t go to the baptism and drop the rope with this friend. A best friend shows up with bells on a friend shows up. She\u2019s doing neither. She\u2019s not even acting like a friend. Motherhood is tiring but that\u2019s no excuse to miss your best friends wedding when it\u2019s the next day. She\u2019s not even actually tired she\u2019s planning on it. Planning on being tired is just code for not wanting to do something. It\u2019s selfish on her part plain and simple. I\u2019d voice your feelings to your friend and then drop the rope. If she comes around great if not don\u2019t go to the baptism. Enjoy your wedding and be around people who actually love and support you enough to show up.", "This has only been posted for 15 minutes, and I already don't understand all of the Y T A.  If it was the same day, then yes, you would be the AH.  But, I really don't understand what they are doing at a baptism that would make them \"too tired\" to attend a wedding *the next day.*  I think your friend is showing you how important your friendship actually is to her. NTA.", "NTA. Too tired from a baptism is an excuse she concocted when she planned the baptism a day before your wedding. She just doesn\u2019t want to go to the wedding. No need to bring it up.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a schedule conflict which I\u2019d understand.  It\u2019s her saying she\u2019ll be too tired?!? \n\nFor a good friend I\u2019d have some strong coffee and at least go for part of it, letting you know in advance how much you can commit to.  \n\nI\u2019d not go to the baptism because of some sudden \u201cwedding obligations\u201d.  She may not bat an eye because maybe she\u2019s not a good friend that really cares.  But if you go to the Baptism & she doesn\u2019t come to the wedding I\u2019d guess you\u2019ll forever feel resentful? \n\nSometimes people show us how little we really mean to them.  Take notice & don\u2019t fight it.  Just accept it and move on.", "Bringing it up? There are lots of ways that you can bring it up. There's the \"I can't beleive you counter scheduled\" way. There's the \"its a shame you can't be there. I'll miss you.\" way. There's the \"I hope that you aren't as tired as you anticipate. If that's the case and it turns out that you can attend, I'll leave a seat for you at the head table.\" way.\n\nSome of them are asshole ways, some aren't. But not expressing your regard for her, not expressing that you'll miss her would be an asshole move.\n\nNTA", "Obviously NTA. They could\u2019ve chosen a different date for the baptism. This just feels like the first example of you being tossed aside because there is a baby.", "NTA \\~ I **assume** you settled the wedding on a date before your friend decided to plan her religious day on a day earlier. Cause this will certainly set the *intention* of that friend.  \nShe wont be tired from the baptism, its just an excuse, and a manipulative way to seek attention, this makes her feel more superior and less insecure.  \nBy the way, you are way to busy with your wedding, even the day(s) before the big day.  \nDon't give her the validation and admiration she's begging for, she is manipulative and has malicious intent.", "NTA because I can\u2019t imagine how a kid\u2019s baptism would makes it\u2019s parents \u201ctoo tired\u201d to do anything the next day. Even if you have a party, it\u2019s the kind of occasion where you might have a cake & a nice meal, not a huge late night drink fest. You\u2019re probably right that something else is going on. That \u201csomething else\u201d might be being the parent of a 2 month old who doesn\u2019t sleep through the night or it might be something else.", "NTA. Weddings are expensive, and deposits were probaly made to prevent you from shifting the date. Baptism on the other hand, you can\u00b4t prepare more them 9 months in advanced, and if shes just telling you about this now, sorry, but she didn\u00b4t want to attend this wedding. Consedering the fact that you guys are this clse, she was probaly standing in your wedding, and plannintg to stand in someone wedding for 3 years before backing out for something that may be rescheduled, is a total ashhole move. But, if this is her choice, you should respect that. YWBTA if you get mad though, because again, it\u00b4s her choice.", "NTA she isn't choosing the baptism over your wedding, she is choosing to have a rest day because she *might* be tired over your wedding.  WAY different", "NTA\n\nYour friend clearly doesn't care that much about your wedding if she isn't even going to go because she is tired. If she did care she could have just had the baptism on the next weekend or something.\n\nDon't go to the baptism, accept that you guys aren't really that good friends.", "Info: is there a particular reason they chose that day? How long have you had your specific date planned?\nIs there any travel involved?", "NTA for wanting the conversation. If my BFF arranged for an important event the day before my already established wedding (and subsequently said she would not attend my wedding), I would definitely be curious as to why. I would at least want to have to conversation to see if there was anything that could be done... There's a reason here...I don't think it's a coincidence.", "NTA, it's a clear slight. She may be your BFF but it's pretty apparent you are not her's, Sorry.", "NTA -- There's nothing wrong with wanting your friend to know how you feel about this situation. The important part is what she does with that information and how you respond", "NTA I thought they were on the same day and she was forced to choose. She actually CAN attend both but just\u2026 doesn\u2019t wanna? She isn\u2019t your friend.", "NTA. Firstly, you are entitled to feel any way you feel. It's what you do about those feelings that matter. But, secondly, you can tell your friend how your feeling and how upset you are by her decision. Maybe she has no control over the date of the baptism, maybe she did. But, as your friend, she could have considered your feelings when choosing. As your friend, she could offer to attend your ceremony if not the reception or some compromise in an effort to support you in your life event. Is this relationship one-sided?", "NAH. You are not an AH to be hurt. It seems like something else is going on with your friend and she was looking for a good reason not to go because she didn\u2019t want to just say no to going to the wedding. Maybe she has PPD. Maybe she is just exhausted from taking care of a baby. Or maybe there is something else going on. Confronting her is unlikely to be productive. Let her know that you will really miss her and wait until you are both in a better headspace to talk about it.", "NTA: even if the baptism was the SAME DAY as the wedding, supposed BFF could at least show up to your reception.  She could hire a sitter.", "It kind of kills the friendship. Was your friend supposed to be in your wedding party? Was she angry you didn\u2019t include her?\n\nIf she\u2019s skipping the wedding, you\u2019re too busy and skip the baptism. Let her know and ask why she didn\u2019t choose a different date that didn\u2019t conflict.", "Was the friend part of the wedding party? I would be upset if a bridesmaid did this so close to the wedding - if it was just a close friend, I would be annoyed; but she\u2019s not ruining anything if she is just a guess", "NTA. It\u2019s not the baptism your friend prioritizes. But it\u2019s the recovery/aftermath of it that she can\u2019t handle. \n\nWhen you\u2019re going to bring that up, preferably don\u2019t use  disappointed. Being disappointed is only a result of your own expectations. Just tell her that you are going to miss her on that day and you think it\u2019s sad that she won\u2019t be joining.", "NTA. \nYou set a date for your wedding in April 2022, so even before she knew about the baby. She could\u2019ve set the date for the baptism a weekend before or after your wedding. So it was done on purpose. \n\nYou can either let it go and just tell her you can\u2019t make it to the baptism because of wedding preparations and accept her not coming to yours. \n\nBut you say she\u2019s your bff so maybe just ask her.", "NTA. I think she\u2019s telling you how she feels about you and I would listen. People move on and things change when you have kids. Personally, I don\u2019t think having kids should automatically make you an asshole. However, that seems to be the case with your friend. If you want to try and save the friendship, you will have to talk this out with her. I just don\u2019t know how you reason with someone who is for whatever reason, extremely selfish.", "NTA. Real friends communicate their feelings. Bad advice from your \u201cfriends.\u201d Does she not understand you will be tired Friday? Preparing for wedding the day before is usually crazy, and you are carving out time for her event. I\u2019d be hurt if my friend refused to come to.", "NTA\n\nComing from a culture where weddings are several days of back to back events, I don't really buy being tired from the day before as a legit excuse. Baptisms are during the day. Is she planning to be hungover from this religious event? It's confusing to me and you have every right to be upset. If it's something you care about you make an effort. She's already decided it's not worth her energy. \n\nI'd say let her do what she wants and distance yourself going forward. People's true colors come up when you need them", "NAH. You being upset is a natural reaction, but I don't blame a new Mother for not being able to go to a wedding a couple of months after birth. She's likely exhausted.", "NTA I have kids, who are baptized, I would never schedule something that would make me miss my BFFs wedding. Most churches have multiple dates for sacraments. She's not your BFF, sorry.", "NTA\n\nThe schedule chosen was intentional\u2014if they were under pressure to take it as it was the only slot left in the *entire* calendar of *all* churches within city radius (lol) she would have added that to her explanation to assure you that it wasn't by choice;\n\nThe weirdass \"I will be tired\" reason is lame, the \"pretty sure\" makes it absurd\u2014how long is a typical baptismal event in Denmark, the whole day?? She doesn't even have to stay during your entire wedding+reception. I hope she doesn't have any role assigned to her that she's quitting as well.\n\nAnd her telling you was more an FYI rather than an extremely remorseful apology and with regret that she'll miss out on your special day.\n\nYou're not as close as you think you are. Honestly, I don't think I'd be enthused to go to the baptism and have bad feelings ferment the whole time which may affect my mood for the following day. I'd rather rest and be mentally supercharged for the excitement on Saturday.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think this is probably just about a baptism. Your friend may also feel overwhelmed by motherhood, new babies drain you in ways that overwork does not. It\u2019s a shock to the system. Your friend may also feel overwhelmed about either bringing baby to the wedding or uncomfortable about having another person watch the baby while they go to the wedding. If I were you, I would schedule a time to go visit my friends house. While you are there, just love on them. Do her dishes or fold some laundry. Hold the baby for an hour so she can go nap. Drop off a casserole so she doesn\u2019t have to cook that night. Show her that you see how hard things are right now. Acknowledge how tired she is right now and how hard is working. Tell her she\u2019s doing a great job. And perhaps lower your expectations. Don\u2019t force this friend to be in the bridal party or stand and pose for pics for hours. Let her know you support her fully - if she is planning to bring baby, do you have a room set aside for nursing and a place she can rest? Let her know it\u2019s fine if she can only stop by for either the ceremony or part of the reception. Let her know it\u2019s fine for her to show up in whatever clothes she is comfortable in. In my experience, for some cultures, baptism is treated like a wedding. With a long ceremony, followed by a reception with music, food, and dancing. Baptisms and weddings are both considered very serious events in the eyes of many churches. But yes, it\u2019s weird the only time the church could have baby\u2019s baptism was literally the day before your wedding. Probably something else going on. Best wishes on your happy day! I know this bothers you, but I hope you will not let it detract from this joyous occasion of being joined together with your fianc\u00e9!!", "I would not bring it up to her. She has clearly made up her mind. I understand that you are hurt, and losing such a close friend when you need her support the most is painful. But hopefully your life will take you in a direction where you will make new friendships and be able to have these connections with people that can reciprocate what you bring to the relationship. As for me, I would not attend her child\u2019s baptism either. You will be incredibly busy with your wedding stuff to worry about her needs. She\u2019s known about your wedding for over a year, and she chose the date of her child\u2019s baptism. It sounds like she is moving on from your friendship, so you should do the same. Seeing her the day before knowing she won\u2019t attend your wedding will only serve to upset you further, and will more than likely ruin your wedding day. Keep your wedding day for you, let go of that hurt and look forward to a hopeful and promising future with your husband instead.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA, but also I\u2019d send a text saying something like \u201cI looked at my schedule for wedding prep and unfortunately will be too busy doing {some vaguely wedding related thing, get a massage, get your nails done, etc.} to be able to attend a baptism the day before my wedding. Hope it\u2019s everything you want it to be\u201d and then just focus on yourself and having fun. Don\u2019t make it about her not coming to your wedding, because it\u2019s not really about that. It\u2019s about her choosing to schedule life things without any regard to your life things. And that sucks from a bff! So maybe she should be demoted from bff status.", "NTA\n\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d is a narcissist.  They can\u2019t do the baptism the weekend before?  It absolutely has to be the day before?  That was really rude of her to pick that day.  It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t know when your wedding is when picking the date for the baptism.  She is being super selfish.  The world doesn\u2019t revolve around her and her new baby.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, you shouldn\u2019t go the baptism.  You have a full day the next day and should be able to spend the day before preparing.", "Is your friend okay? If you really where besties this wouldntve happened. Methinks your friends boyfriend is telling her she cant/shouldnt go. Her baptism excuse is just that. I hope its bad faith rather than bad situation. NTA tho", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry that you feel this way but I agree and would think the same way you\u2019re feeling. And if she\u2019s as good as a friend as you say she is then she should understand and appreciate you bringing it up to her. I think your friends that are saying it\u2019s an issue are shitty friends. I would 100 out of 100 times rather my friend question something that may be going on with me. And to be to tired to go to your wedding is just bs to me. Good luck and if she doesn\u2019t go to your wedding than just do your best to enjoy yourself", "NTA the whole thing reeks of someone trying to belittle your life events. You sure she's a friend? \n\nAlso how are you going to go to a baptism the day before your wedding? From memory that day was one of the most stressful days ever.", "NTA - it\u2019s okay to express to her how you\u2019re feeling, as long as you don\u2019t get mad at her for how she responds. Your feelings are valid regardless of if they are \u201crational\u201d or not. I suggest talking to your friend, telling her you understand her position but feel personally hurt. I hope you guys can have a good conversation and find some kind of compromise", "NTA, but, she might have ppd. Or doesn\u2019t feel like she could handle a full day of wedding festivities. I would say it\u2019s not personal.", ">I feel like she views my wedding as insignificant compared to their baptism, even though both events are important happenings in our respective lives.\n\nAnd you view her baptism as insigificant compared to your wedding. That's okay, you live separate lives.\n\nAn invitiation to your wedding is an offer, not a summons. If someone can come, great. If they can't, that's no problem either.\n\nFor you, her baptism seems a smaller event, not that far away. But for her, it may be a hugely more significant event and a lot more draining. Perhaps they've got family coming from far away, people staying, lots to arrange and see to. \n\nAs a new mother, things can be absolutely exhausting, let alone without a huge public event to organise and attend. She probably doesn't want to commit to two events back to back, especially if she can't give both the attention she'd want to. \n\nDon't become a bride-zilla about this. You invited her, she said she doesn't think she can make it. That's life. NAH.", "NAH. Depending on the denomination, churches are blocked literally 12+ months out, and it sounds like she\u2019s struggling with potential PPD and the guilt/stigma around PPD. She may also be doing the baptism at a church where it is a full affair with parental classes etc. beforehand. \n\nI\u2019ve had PPD twice and it took 2 years for me to feel even close to normal with my oldest.", "She's a new mother and doesn't want to leave her baby. It is not a slight to you. It's very common to be extremely hard to leave a new baby.", "NTA. She may very well be tired the day after, but I'm stuck on why she would schedule the baptism the day before your wedding when she knew the date far in advance. I've never held a baptism so I don't know what all goes into planning/scheduling it, but it can't be anything close to planning a wedding. Why couldn't she have it the weekend before or after the wedding? She's not a very good friend.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your best friend if she is willing to miss a big event like you getting married.", "NTA \n\nShe could have planned the baptism any other day but she literally told you that they choose the day before the wedding . So why didn't she just choose the week after ? \n\nIf she can't come to your wedding it kinda kills your long friendship because that's a major life event. \nSo i completely understand you being angry about it.", "NAH:\n\nYour friend gave birth in February. It is likely that she is exhausted EVERY day. My guess is that when the baptism was scheduled, your wedding date was the last thing on her mind. This was not intended to dis you. It was the reality of having a major medical event, coming home with a newborn, dealing with her own relatives, scheduling with her place of worship for the baptism. I don't think it was her intention to slight you.\n\nThat said, you have every right to be disappointed that your friend will not be able to attend your wedding. Try to be understanding. Even IF the baptism were not the day before your wedding, the chances that she would not be able to attend would be high. She may not want to bring an unvaccinated newborn to a large, public event. She may not be ready to leave her newborn with somebody else, especially if she is breastfeeding. She is also feeding her newborn every 2-3 hours, changing diapers, EVERYTHING that entails having a newborn.\n\nIn summery, you have the right to be disappointed that your friend will miss your wedding. You also need to understand that she has a tiny human being who is completely dependent on her. That little person now is her priority. Attend the baptism if you can. Let her know you would love it if she can attend your wedding but accept if she is not able to do so. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming Wedding.", "Nta, um what kind of baptism are they doing that they need a day to recover from? They're on different days.  She should be able to do both.", "NTA  having had many newborns myself I can tell you they are exhausting but if your friends really cares about you she would make the effort to be there if she can't it really shows how little she values you and you have to adjust your friendship and what it means accordingly", "NTA. I would take this as a comment on the friendship.", "This may be unpopular, but NAH.\n\nIt sucks that she wasn't able to schedule the baptism on a different day (although I'm not sure how much leeway there is in different churches ) It sucks that she either can't or doesn't want to go to your wedding. This must feel incredibly hurtful and it makes sense that you would be upset.\n\nHowever, I can also see from her perspective that it sounds like she's probably going through a tough time. I don't know how big of an event a baptism is in her faith (like, is there a big family party? Or just an appointment with the priest?) but I would not think it's something that would ordinarily make her too tired to go to a wedding the next day. If she's anticipating being that tired, there's a good chance she's exhausted from having a newborn. She might be too tired to go to a wedding but doesn't know how to talk about it. She might not be able to afford a babysitter or feel uncomfortable with one. Babies are exhausting. I feel for her.\n\nMaybe find a way to reach out to her if it's a friendship worth keeping.", "INFO: when is the baptism/wedding? I ask because I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s more to it. \n\nShe had her baby in February so it\u2019s at most 2 months old. Depending when the wedding and baptism are, baby could still be quite young. With that in mind, a few things to consider. Baby is probably not sleeping through the night yet and if she\u2019s breast feeding, night wakings are solely on her. Add the baptism to that and her being exhausted is understandable.

I think you would be a major AH if you approached your friend from the perspective of expecting her to justify why she is not willing to be there for you when you are there for her, i.e. from a self-centered perspective. If, however, you approach her from the perspective a concerned friend, who views this situation as unusual and wonders if she has something she needs to talk about (depression, anxiety, health issues following the birth; complicated feelings related to the wedding she hasn't been able to articulate; something you may have said or done to distance her that you are unaware of; complicated feelinfs related to her own relationship she hasnt been able to articulate), then no, you wouldn't be.\n\nRight now I'm going with NAH, because your feelings are understandable (and you haven't actually done anything yet), and because we dont have enough information about why your friend isnt going to the wedding (I doubt very seriously it's as simple as \"I'llbe tired\").

I get the impression it would probably help you a lot to have clarity/closure on that, and I think that's probably the important thing to focus on. I think you'd be okay to bring it up to her - like you said you've weathered life's ups and downs together - but my advice would be: take a breath first. Try to make it about communicating that love and need for understanding instead of the anger. Something like 'Hey \\[friend\\], I've been feeling a bit sad about not seeing you on my wedding day. I totally hear you about being super tired! But I suppose I've been worrying that something about it means you don't want to be there. Could I be vulnerable for a sec and ask why you decided on \\[baptism date\\] for the baptism? I've reckoned it's probably an important date for you guys or something, but like I said, I've just been in my head about it'. But like, in your style of speaking obviously.  \n\n\nI reckon something like that - seeking clarity and just communicating that you're feeling a bit down and worried about it - will get you the answers you need instead of feeling all tangled up and worried about this. You guys sound like you have a really deep friendship and I'm genuinely really confident you have the communication and the bonds to work through this. Having some vulnerable conversation might even open the door to something really positive, like maybe she's really locked into that date for the baptism but she was feeling sad about the wedding too and you guys can do something else to celebrate together around the same time or something, or like you said, maybe she is going through stuff and you will be able to be there for her.", "NTA ... But ...\n\nI've been at baptisms that would probably be a bigger event than your wedding.

I can predict when I'm going to be absolutely out of commission the next day. Sometimes two days, depending upon the event.\n\nAnd I said this because, as someone who has had a best girlfriend for almost 50 years ... We each had stages and phases in our lives when we couldn't connect on the same level.  Pre-technology, we could go a few months without talking.  Thankfully, we navigated these times with grace, never forgetting that we loved each other more than our biological sisters.  And although our lives led us in directions we never saw coming, we never gave up on each other. We are GOOD for each other, and that meant neither of us surrendered.  We paused, occasionally, but never gave up.\n\nSometimes we don't, and can't, understand.  We change and grow.  I know you're hurt. I don't blame you. But if she is good for you, and you are good for her, don't give up entirely.  It just may be a season, in your lives, when there needs to be more space. And it's honestly okay.  You do get to tell her that you're hurt. You don't need to be a doormat.  But i hope that you both will give energy for healing.\n\nWe're now even closer than ever, despite a 3 hour drive between us.

You are justified in being upset. This isn\u2019t just a college roommate, or a work bestie, this is a lifelong best friend. Practically family.

Could she be suffering with post-partum depression? If so, have you been there for her and supportive of her? \n\nHave you been accommodating of her transition into motherhood?", "NAH. Obviously you\u2019re N T A, but neither is the mother, nor are the friends for being over-sensitive to the mother\u2019s feelings.  \n\nMy reasons have already been mentioned by other N A H verdicts, I just wanted to add my vote. Hopefully OP and the BFF can have a productive conversation.", "If the friend is from a background like some people are describing, where baptisms are a huge big deal involving a family party, then she may be very sure that she'll be exhausted.\n\nIt would have been nice if the friend could have planned the baptism a different date, but she may have been trying to accomodate a lot of grandparents, aunts and uncles, godparents, dates that the priest was available, etc. Scheduling can be a real nighmare! There could also be other restrictions, such as needing to have it done by a certain age, or while the baby is still young enough to fit in a family heirloom gown. I've definitely known families where that is the case! She may be between a rock and hard place: she can offend her friend, or she can offend her parents, her in-laws, and basically her whole family. Which would you choose? It may be a compliment to OP, that OP's friend thought OP would be more understanding and reasonable than the friend's MIL.\n\nWhen I got married, the mutual friend who introduced me to my husband could not attend, because it turned out that his sister was getting married on the exact same day. I was sad, but I understood. I certainly didn't want to put him in a position of, Who do you love more, two of your best friends, or your sister?", "NTA.\n\nSo I\u2019m on the other side of this\u2014one of my best friends is getting married later this year, I\u2019m currently pregnant and due about 4 months before her wedding.\n\nI have been planning, since the day I found out I was pregnant, how I am going to make it happen because god dammit it\u2019s *going* to happen. And I\u2019m not just attending as a guest\u2014I\u2019m a bridesmaid.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve been very upfront with her the entire time, and we\u2019ve been very open with communication from the get-go. She\u2019s aware I can\u2019t go to her bachelorette party, that I might not be able to be at the rehearsal dinner, and that there\u2019s going to be a couple months immediately after birth where I\u2019m not going to be much help to her. BUT she also knows I am doing everything in my power to make sure I am there, fully present, on the day of; that I\u2019m doing whatever I can to help and support her before I no longer can; and that she\u2019s important to me. Because she is, and though I\u2019m stressing (first kid, so postpartum period is definitely a big scary unknown), there\u2019s very little that would make me not be there at all.\n\nI completely understand why you\u2019re hurt, and am a little confused why your friends are saying it\u2019s so inappropriate for you to talk to her about it. New babies obviously require leeway and flexibility and adjustment to what\u2019s reasonable to ask of the new parents, but I don\u2019t think her attending as a guest, 5 months postpartum and as one of your best friends, is unreasonable to talk about with her.", "YTA to yourself and your friend if you don't address this with her.\n\nBaptisms can be horrendously strenuous. Big Catholic family. Been there done that. Not every situation is the same, but many of the commenters are making decisions based on assumptions. A proper judgment can't be made by you or anyone else because your information isn't complete.\n\nF32 is your lifelong friend. Birth and the year after that can be terrifying or mentally draining for any number of reasons. You have enough information to deduce that your lifelong friend may be going through far more than she's mentioning.  She may have told you that she couldn't go because she has a valid reason that she can't but doesn't want to discuss it.\n\nThere are valid reasons that she might not want to discuss it.  I'll make a possible excusable example. She's getting up early to help set up because there's not enough people to help without her, she's breastfeeding, is dealing with PPD, and her In-Laws are mentally taxing. She had to deal with physical and mental strain while being around with people who don't exactly like her.\n\nIt wouldn't be wrong for you to inquire further if you're doing it from a source of concern for your friend. Don't make it about attending your wedding or an interrogation. Ask her about the baptism.\n\nFirst, say that it isn't about your wedding. 5 months is young and it'd naturally make a mother exhausted. If she's tired enough to be unable to attend your wedding, then it must be hard. You've never had children before, so ask her what it's all like. What's the day going to be for her? Is there a lot of preparation? Etc.\n\nLet her tell her story if she feels like doing so. You'll get your answers as she communicates.", "Sorry all of your friends suck.", "NAH. Each event is important to each of you, but at different levels. Your wedding is a life event for you, but so is her child's baptism to her. \n\nShe's a new mom, so she's likely already tired on a normal day. Add to that a baptism which for some can be an all day event, not just the ceremony.  A wedding ceremony could also take as little as 5 minutes, but with the ceremony (especially if it's religious one), pictures, then reception, she might not be up to 2 days of events.\n\nIn regards to her choosing a different day, the church only has certain days they can have baptisms. Just like a wedding venue, churches can be booked out well ahead of time. \n\nOP could've also not chosen July 4th holiday weekend to have her wedding.", "NTA\n\nSit down for a coffee and touch base with your friend. You even brought up she might be struggling a bit and not want to share. \"Super mommy\" and all that. Let her know you want her there even if it's just for the ceremony and/or the reception. Then be ready for when she still says no. Or web she dumps her struggles on you.

Even if I left after the ceremony, I would be there. \n\nThe wedding date was already set, and she made the *decision* to plan something for the day before. She DECIDED to not go to the wedding. Regardless of whether or not the church could only do it on this date or whatever other excuse she gives, she's being inconsiderate and showing that OPs life events are not important to her. \n\nThe bottom line is that sometimes you have to show up for people. Sometimes you will have to put aside your own selfish tendencies and be there because it's something that is important to someone else.   \nI'm not saying to risk your own emotional wellbeing, but ALL relationships are give and take. Friendships are no exception. It has to go both ways.\n\nShe can't expect OP to go the baptism and in the same breath imply that Ops wedding isn't important enough for her to attend. She's being a bad friend, and I don't blame OP for wanting to communicate that to her. In fact, it would be healthier to explain your side and let her know that having her at your wedding is important. Especially considering the alternative is just to let her hurt you and let it stew until you break. To always be reminded when you look at wedding pictures of how you weren't important enough. \n\nIt's a crappy situation to be in. \n\nGood luck Op.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m confused about a few things here. First you say you settled on a date of April 2022. At least that\u2019s how I read it. Then you say it\u2019s in July. When did you change it? Why did you pick the 4th of July weekend? (If you aren\u2019t American then this question is moot).\n\nWere you aware that some churches set aside specific dates and times for baptisms? Could they have set the date and then you changed yours? Or you did it simultaneously? I also know that for some families the baptism is followed by a big party. My family traditionally has a big party with out of town family members coming in and a big gathering afterwords. The actual baptism wouldn\u2019t be tiring, but the gathering of family, friends, and the party after would be very tiring. That would also explain how she\u2019s know in advance. This is what one branch of my family does, so I know how it goes! \n\nIf you could just simply tell her that you hope she could make it to your wedding you would really love that, you wouldn\u2019t be a backside of a mule. There is nothing wrong with expressing that hope.

As a mother of two it\u2019s understandable to not want to do both activities in one weekend\u2026I\u2019m very much the same way and can\u2019t over book myself. That being said, the friend clearly doesn\u2019t think your wedding is important by choosing the same weekend for the baptism. I\u2019m petty and wouldn\u2019t say shit to the friend and cut ties after. I\u2019d never ask someone to not attend their baptism, move it, or not be tired from those events. But I\u2019d also take it really personally that my wedding wasn\u2019t considered when planning the baptism. The friend is telling you what matters now and it\u2019s not you. Sorry, it stinks.

You're not an asshole for being upset - friends grow apart, and the people you prioritize won't always prioritize you back as you hope they would. It sucks, but that's life. If you want to extend yourself to go to the baptism the day before your wedding, that's up to you. \n\nIf you do speak with her, express your disappointment that she won't be at your wedding, and maybe ask if she'd reconsider as her being there is really important to you and would mean a great deal given the length and depth of your friendship.

Best of luck!", "Ok everyone saying the friend is wrong is not thinking about the whole picture. There are a couple of valid reasons the friend choose this date. One reason it is date that works for everyone. Meaning family may be coming from out of town. The only time the godparents have available. The day the church had available that works for everyone involved. \n\nAlso yes she will be tired because a baptism is a big event. I was tired helping my daughter do her son birthday party. We don\u2019t know if family coming is coming on a plane which means trips to the airport picking people up. Have to get the food and decorations ready. Plus do her everyday mom stuff.

Maybe in the end she'll be able to rally... I hope you enjoy your wedding and your guests regardless.", "While I technically \"get\" all the NTA decisions here, I find there is an underlying assholery to just about everyone who sincerely believes their wedding and other largely symbolic ceremonial events should be as monumentally important to those around them as they are to themselves. People are allowed to have their own lives and to feel like things going on in their own lives preclude them from going to anything due to time or stress, health or *whatever* without it being a great disrespect or implying anything tremendous about what they think of the people holding the event and their relationship. It is quite literally not about them, and while I know the wedding industry has plied people with the addictive belief that they are entitled to everything being about them for at *least one day* (but often a whole weekend or week, and sometimes even permeating the whole time it takes to plan even if it's years)*,* but it's not true and other people's lives go on. \n\nOP is perceiving disrespect where there should be none, or at least very little--their relationship has been what it is and they *should* know the content of their friend's character and what they mean to them and the ways they likely will and won't show up for them and what sort of circumstances may interfere with that. I would think they should have perhaps a touch more empathy for their situation as new parents and how difficult that can be for some people. Their friend has already quite pointedly said they are exhausted and can't foresee not being exhausted for some time. And while their exhaustion may not reach this extent, post-partum depression is very real and it's entirely possible their friend could be struggling more than OP knows in their comparably brief and happy visits with baby and recounts of how each other is doing. It is often very hard for new parents to share how much they are struggling, lest they be perceived as ungrateful or as though they regret or resent the child.  Nevertheless, when the friend explicitly tells OP they're struggling with everything on their plate and gives them an apologetic foreshadowing of their predicted bandwidth *months in advance*, OP's compulsion is to brush over it with a belittling \"but what about me?\" underlined by an assumption that whatever their friend is going through can't possibly be that bad.\n\nI don't know.

I was extremely upset. No one informed me before hand that they wouldn't come. I never brought it up and soon after I went abroad with my husband. We do sometimes catch up. I have a child, they have kids. No one really has the time.\n\nThis is how life goes. Sometimes, our paths cross, we become great friends and then it diverges.", "NTA\n\nShe doesnt want to come and she may be your best friend but you are not hers.\n\nShe has already decided that she is too tired before the event. I hope you have better friends than her and I am sorry that she is treating you like this", "Yeah.. it's weird to schedule something like that when the wedding has been planned for a while. And a Friday? Generally they are on Sundays, although it's not required. But..", "I agree!!!!", "Yuuup. It\u2019s the \u201cI\u2019ll be tired the next day\u201d that is the dead giveaway. For something important you show up, tired or not. She wants out of attending the wedding and this is her excuse. Bring it up and see what she says. It might be a friendship ruiner but so is your best friend bailing on your wedding with barely an excuse.", "that was my thought, the date of the wedding was well set, she could just as easily have set the baptism for a week earlier or a week later. but to set it right on the same weekend? that sends a message.", "I\u2019m a parent and I find this baffling. Attended/hosted many back-to-back events when my kid was an infant. Breastfed at several weddings and a funeral. You\u2019re tired for the first ~9mos anyway. What difference does it make where you are at the time? Especially as OP has been incredibly kind in making her wedding child-friendly (which should be the default IMO but that\u2019s another matter). Or leave the kiddo with dad if s/he will take a bottle. There\u2019s something else going on here.", "This. She picked that date knowing OP was getting married the next day. She can dedicated her first born's life to a cult any day.\n\nNTA.\n\nIs she jealous OPs getting married when she just got a baby from her bf?", "Plus it's a Baptism.  If she gave a shit about the wedding she could simply do the church bit (presumably morning/afternoon) then rest and have a dinner/party another time.", "I would do the same thing but.. the pain of a lifetime best friend doing this is going to sting for a while.", "This!  It\u2019s disappointing but I\u2019d let it go because who knows, maybe baby is a horrible sleeper and friend is one of those people who feel absolutely ill without sleep and can\u2019t fathom two events in a row. Or maybe there was some family reason for the date that she\u2019s not at liberty to reveal. Or maybe she\u2019s just pulling away as a friend. Painful but could be true. Since she\u2019s not in your bridal party I\u2019d focus on your day and see where the friendship goes in the next few years.", "Getting married in a couple weeks and I would. It be attending an event the day before my wedding even if we didn\u2019t have the rehearsal dinner then.", "It's also wild to ask a bride to attend a baptism the day before her wedding. Usually the day before includes a lot of preparation including the rehearsal dinner and stuff.", ">If it was the same day, then yes, you would be the AH.\n\nI disagree with this. The wedding has likely been scheduled for months. If the friend had also scheduled the baptism for the day of the wedding, then the friend would definitely be an AH.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t understand how OP isn\u2019t too busy to attend the baptism in the first place. I\u2019d hit bestie with, \u201cSorry, I will be too busy and tired to attend the baptism since my wedding is the following day.\u201d", "Seriously. Like she knew the date. Who plans an important event the day before ? \nNot a good friend. It's not like you need to have a baptism in a certain time frame. She could have moved it a week later even", "Agreed. Some people seem to think that when you\u2019re a parent it means not prioritizing other relationships. Why a child should \u25b3\u20d2\u20d8lways be number 1, and the dynamic of relationships will change to an extent, it doesn\u2019t mean you just throw these relationships out with the baby\u2019s bath water. All relationships take some degree of effort.. even if you\u2019re tired.", "I would also consider the relationship with the other friends that called her an AH for feeling the way she did. She went to them for help and they could have supplied op  with alternative views or suggested advice, but they did neither except shame her for her feelings. Even if they completely disagree, friends validate feelings even if they disagree and should have helped her find a solution that doesn\u2019t involve bottling up how she feels.", "And still OP has every right to be upset about it.", "This is a very stoic approach; I like it and thank you for the advice and perspective! :-)", "While that is true, it\u2019s still hurtful and you can be both rational and deeply hurt by an event.", "The friends I\u2019ve asked are new parents because I thought they had the best frame of reference - they all said that they understand my feelings, but they think I\u2019m an asshole for wanting to talk to her about it, because they don\u2019t think she needs the stress (because being parent to a newborn is already stressful).\n\nOf course, my friends that don\u2019t have children feel the opposite.", "This is likely the correct take. I think the friends who are telling OP to let is go know something about the situation that the friend isn't telling her.", "Maybe it\u2019s not too clear; we settled on the date of July \u201823 (this year) back in April \u201822. So our close friends and family have known the date (first Saturday in July) for about a year by now.\n\nAlso, we\u2019re not American, so the 4th of July isn\u2019t a holiday for us. :-)", "No, we don\u2019t have that kind of wedding party constellation in Danish weddings. :-)", "I don\u2019t have a maid of honour, it isn\u2019t a normal thing to for people to officially have in Denmark. :-)\n\nSo you can easily have best friends that aren\u2019t really involved with anything in the wedding besides giving a speech and/or holding the bride\u2019s dress up when she has to go to the bathroom during the night.", "No, I am not a bridezilla. :-) And I don\u2019t know; after many of the comments mentioning PPD, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s probably deeper than avoiding my wedding and I\u2019ll be asking her about her feelings and if anything is going on with her. :-)", "In Denmark we don\u2019t really have a wedding party; so every guest is technically just \u201ca normal attendee\u201d except for the father of the bride, the mother of the groom, a best man and a toastmaster (who is usually the best man or the father of the bride).\n\nWe are definitely as close as indicated; we\u2019ve known each other literally almost our whole lives (since we were less than a year old) and even though we are very different we are as close as sisters. :-)", "We don\u2019t really have that kind of wedding party in Denmark; so the only \u201cconsequence\u201d of her not being there is me missing my best friend at my wedding. :-)", "I went to a convention last week. Purposefully scheduled to do nothing the entirety of the week after because, yes, I absolutely *knew* I would be tired that week.\n\nI have an event the end of this month to meet up with people, and am purposefully keeping the day after for rest because I *know* I will be tired after it.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to know you're going to be tired after engaging in a tiring activity.\nOP is NTA, and her friend abso-freakin'-lutely sucks, but not for knowing her own body and that she'll need a rest. It's weird you insist she can't know how her own endurance works.", "I always know I will be exhausted the day after events. People do know their own bodies. And depending on religious beliefs and scheduling, she may not have had many choices of when to schedule baby\u2019s baptism, either. It sort of sounds like a no-win situation for everyone.", "Have you ever thrown a big family event?  Or even a dinner party?  I\u2019m always exhausted the next day from everything involved in throwing an event.  Cleaning the house, cooking, entertaining, etc are all laborious and tiring.  I couldn\u2019t imagine going to a wedding the very next day.  Should she have planned her child\u2019s baptism on a different day?  Yes, so she\u2019s still TA for that.", "Well yes, parents typically anticipate being tired the day after an event for their children. Because being a parent is exhausting. I'm not a parent, but I used to be a live-in nanny. That was exhausting, and I was able to hand them back when I got too tired or when the day was over. So yes, she probably knows that she will already be too tired, because she is dealing with a baby.\nI'm not saying that she couldn't have scheduled it for a different day, she definitely could and should have if her friendship was important to her. However, anticipating that you're going to be tired the day after an event for your child, is not an outrageous thing to assume.", "I grew up Catholic, and baptisms were usually done as part of regular Sunday mass, not a separate event and not on other days of the week. Maybe that depends on the denomination, though. Always knew it was going to be an extra long mass when we saw the babies in the christening gowns \ud83d\ude29", "Yup, nail on the head. Some more traditional sects will mandate all baptisms be done on Easter, but that is few and far between. And as other comments are saying, the baptism itself is just a few minutes of ceremony (depending on the amount of children), and it's the afterparty that tends to be large, also depending on the culture", "In my (non catholic) church, you can\u2019t just pick your preferred baptism date.", "It may also be that finding a date that worked for the maximum number of people in her family just unfortunately fell the day before her friend's wedding. Planning any major family event (particularly if you have a large and/or religious family) can be a huge pain the arse and at the end of the day she may have chosen to prioritize her son's baptism on a day as many people can make it over her friend's wedding. It's a clash of the milestone moments and it does happen, however unfortunate it is. \n\nHard to judge this one for me as a consequence.", "If family is coming in from out of town, they may timing limitations.  Grandma at kid's baptism vs. someone else's wedding?  Most people are picking grandma.", "Maybe OP isn\u2019t having a bridal party? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I didn\u2019t have one when I got married.", "Ahh, that\u2019s it! She\u2019s hurt she\u2019s not in the wedding!", "I\u2019m wondering about that, too.", "Oh good point. I want to know if she\u2019s in the bridal party as well and if she is not.. why? That could explain why her friend isn\u2019t prioritizing the wedding if OP hadn\u2019t included her in the bridal party which could be similarly hurtful to those who are sentimental about things like that.", "That's the million dollar question. If they are BFFs, then the friend should be the Maid of Honor or at least in the wedding party. If she was not asked, then she's not that important to the bride.", "I wish I had an award for you. Take this: \ud83d\ude08\ud83e\udd47", "\ud83d\ude02 thank you for this", "The baby would be about 5 months old by this time, an infant who has likely in a schedule by then.", "I mean, I don't disagree that it's fair for the OP to be hurt, and I have questions about the timing of the baptism, but. I'm Greek Orthodox, and baptisms are an Event, lol. My cousin had full on receptions akin to wedding receptions for her kids--i literally wore my prom dress and we traveled for it, lmao. And like....that's more extreme even culturally but, most baptisms I've attended have had some sort of party attached. I'm not saying that's for sure happening here because we don't have that information, but it's absolutely possible for a baptism to be tiring.", "Because she's likely having family and guests over afterward. \n\n1.   Needs to clean house\n2. Make food. \n3.  Cleanup afterwards", "IDK if its cause im hispanic but right after a baptism we have a party and they usually last a while.", "That's true.  I hadn't even thought of that.  I wonder how pissed off OP's friend would be is OP told her she wasn't coming to the baptism?", "Yes!! Why is it okay for a bride to attend an event on a stressful day for her but the new mom can\u2019t return the respect? That\u2019s the issue here. Being tired is used as an excuse but it\u2019s not a great one.", "This is exactly it. It\u2019s the mutual support. OP is all about going to a baptism the day before her wedding (which will be busy and stressful to her) but her friend can\u2019t even come to her wedding for an hour or two to support her? The friendship is uneven.", "But then would OP complain that BFF didn\u2019t do enough for her wedding? BFF is dropping out of the wedding with plenty of advance notice, NAH", "I wonder of bestie is jealous of the wedding or OP somehow. Seems awfully suspicious and selfish to happen to pick the day before the wedding for no apparent reason. Might be crazy enough to think having a baptism the day before would \u201covershadow\u201d her friend\u2019s wedding and keep attention on her. I know someone like this unfortunately.", "well put! i whole heartly agree. Feels good when you filtered fake friends from real friends, leave them at the dumpster.", "I\u2019m a parent of 7 & 5 year old although agnostic. \n\nSo didn\u2019t do any religious rituals.\nI have friends and family that do.\n\nI find it super weird that she booked a date the day before yours and then said she might be too tired.\n\nYou\u2019re her friend. Even if that\u2019s the only date she could book, she could still come but just for the ceremony or even a little bit of the reception.\n\nNTA", "OP, I also suspect she's going through some emotional issues! I don't think she's trying to break off the friendship though. Some women take a full year to feel even remotely human after a normal birth, a hard birth can really take a toll. My daughter struggled for a year and a half after her son was born! \n\nIt may be that there are family dynamics that had her choose the day before your wedding. I would call her, let her know that you will miss her at the wedding. And let her know, that if she feels up to coming she's more than welcome to show up. Leave the door open.\n\nYou sound like a caring friend.\n\nHave a wonderful wedding, sending happy thoughts from a Canadian grandmother \ud83d\udc9c\n\nOh yes, NTA.", "And OP stated she was attending the baptism on a very stressful day before her wedding when most people would not. That tells me she is willing to prioritize her friend and be there for her friend but it\u2019s not reciprocated.", "This is what I was thinking as well. If everyone she knows is telling her to leave it alone, maybe she should listen.", "So she's not leaving you in the lurch with a missing bridal party member.  It does seem odd that she intentionally scheduled the christening for the weekend of your wedding when she already knew your wedding date.  Is it possible that she's having some post partum issues and just doesn't feel up to the wedding but didn't know how to explain it to you?\n\nWill you be attending the christening?  Could you maybe talk to her about how sad you're feeling to not have her be part of this special event in your life and see if maybe she could just come for the ceremony-- or if she could maybe just come for the dinner part of the reception?    \n\n\nand NTA for feeling hurt/confused/upset  but talk to her and see what's going on .", "Neither in European in general. Seems an American thing", "In that case, YTA. Your friend is probably in her new mom bubble and that is where her focus should be, and putting her baby and herself first is not an AH move.", "'lo neighbour! I'm in Sweden and now I'm curious as to what important role the mother of the groom has? I've never heard about such a tradition before. \n\n(My parents were planning to marry in Skagen but the priest rejected them lol)", "Wow I managed to have all four of my kids baptized (including a set of twins) and I didn\u2019t have to take to my bed the next day.", "You don't need to wrangle a baby though. The kid was born in February, he'll be like 6 months old at the baptism.", "Depends on the church. In mine we baptize so soon I was never at the services and barely made it to my kids' baptisms because I was exhausted. But we had a few choices or could do it later which in my family wasn't done. I have no idea how other denominations do thiers but the date you want doesn't always work or in big congregations or big families you could be stuck. Nothing wrong with feeling disappointed. You can say you will miss her and enjoy your day though", "It's such a weird take imo \"what?? nobody knows themselves and their bodies enough to know when they're gonna be tired!\"\n\nLike, yeah, many people do. Sorry that person doesn't, but it's not odd at all to know yourself that well", "if it's post partem that is actually really understandable then", "That is my thought. This isn\u2019t just a regular get together like going out to dinner.. it\u2019s her wedding which is an important milestone event. It seems a genuine friend would make the wedding unless something else happened like an illness or something similar to that. Being tired isn\u2019t entirely a useable excuse.. since, she\u2019s a parent and she\u2019s going to pretty much be tired for the rest of her life. What she is inadvertently saying is that her friend just isn\u2019t that important to prioritize.. and I don\u2019t mean over her own baby, just in general. This isn\u2019t a casual friendship but her best friend who has been her best friend her whole life. To me, this would be a big deal, as well.. and I don\u2019t even like weddings. But replace it with someone else that is important and it\u2019s hurtful.", "Exactly. She had the baby in Feb and baptism is not till July. That\u2019s 5 months apart. And once you become a parent, tired is part of the deal. You don\u2019t diss a friend because you\u2019re tired.", "We don't know her, though. Maybe she has some chronic illness, maybe she's not recovered from giving birth. Possibly the baptism is exhausting enough, so then she'll basically have to pull through two different events instead of resting.", "Yeah, my friend's son Catholic Baptism was scheduled on Sunday morning (which I know to be mass) in 2 weeks, until they had to move it, because the birth certificate hasn't come in yet.", "For Catholics in Ireland the rule of thumb is to be baptised within the first three months of birth. They can be scheduled easily enough and some priests will baptise more than one child during a baptism service. \n\nOP is NTA for being upset her friend can\u2019t make her wedding.", "Most of the people I know who are not Catholic are from denominations who don't baptise babies (they might baptise kids or teenagers) and they don't tend to invite non-church goers.

I also sometimes have trouble pinpointing those days, but when I have something planned in advance and I know that those activities usually exhaust me, I'm going to assume that I'm going to be too tired to do much of anything else the next day.

I know how that is when my long time best friend had a child and she no longer prioritized me at ALL. Meanwhile I had two kids years before her and I still made the effort to see her and speak with her and still drove up 13 hours where she lived to meet her baby. I made that effort because I loved her and she meant the world to me. People make the effort for people they care about. After 5 years of excuses not to see me, even when it was me going out of my way to come visit her, I realized that we weren\u2019t friends and I haven\u2019t talked to her in two years.

It certainly seems like the choice of date for the baptism could\u2019ve been different. But as a new first time mom myself I\u2019ll say this: it\u2019s so stressful. For the first few months, even thinking about an outing with baby to see family for dinner 35 minutes away would give me severe anxiety.

I've served at countless Baptisms and other sacraments, as well as attending the post-celebrations of each. I'm quite well versed in what a Baptism entails in the traditional, Novus Ordo, and extraordinary rites, thank you. Per CANON LAW 856, Baptisms do not have to happen on Sundays or during any Mass Liturgy. It is also preferable per the rubrics that the baptism does NOT happen during the Mass itself, but actually right before. Although many current parishes will celebrate it during the Mass after the Gospel. That does not change the fact that the Baptism itself is only a few minutes per child. Furthermore, this Baptism is on a Friday, meaning it almost certainly will NOT be held during a Mass, as it is against Canon Law to hold a full Sunday observance on a weekday, and Daily Masses are quite short and typically held in the early mornings.\n\n\"Baptism is incredibly important to some people.

The actual *act* of baptism may only take a few minutes, but \u201cbaptizing the baby\u201d requires the frantic getting ready beforehand, smooshing all the relatives together to get them to the church on time, realizing you\u2019re at the wrong door, changing the baby (twice), putting on the baptismal outfit as they wriggle and scream at all the lace and satin, the actual baptism, which, yes, is relatively fast, but is also fraught with anxiety because YOU ARE STANDING UP IN FRONT OF A WHOLE CHURCH FULL OF PEOPLE WITH A SCREAMING BABY, who you realize is hungry even though you just fed him. You\u2019ve got to hand him over to his godparents for the actual baptism (in the Orthodox Church) and boy he doesn\u2019t like that and egads he doesn\u2019t like his entire body being submerged under water (again, Orthodox Church, but I\u2019ve seen Catholic babies equally as furious at being poured). In the Orthodox Church we do baptism and Chrismation all at once so we then go to Liturgy where baby will receive his first communion. He\u2019s been grumpy the whole time. Now Liturgy is over, it only lasted an hour and a half. Time for a trek to the social building where we have lunch. We have to wait for the Priest to bless the other meal. The other kids are DONE.

Just church is four hours including driving. \n\nAnd I received my marriage license and signed my marriage certificate the day of my wedding.

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with saying that you are disappointed with how the timing worked out, that she wouldn\u2019t be able to come to the wedding. This makes it a little less accusatory but keeps resentment from building up by ignoring it. Could they be working on a religious timeline (baby needs to be baptized within so many weeks of birth sort of thing)? Or maybe scheduling around family traveling into town for the event? There could be an innocent reason at play that you just aren\u2019t aware of.", "NTA as long as you communicate it well, don't hold her responsible for your feelings, and dont make assumptions about her of her motivations, you should be fine to revisit this.", "NTA. It sounds like your lifelong bff is beginning the process to end the friendship.", "NTA. Your friend is choosing to not attend your wedding. It hurts and you are justified.  If you are close, you should be able to ask why she chose the dame weekend as the wedding. She should be able to calmly tell you why. \n\nBe honest with her and expect the same from her. \nI'm  a parent of 4. There is a lot to juggle, especially when they are little, but we all make time for and accommodate the things and people we value.", "She planned her event, months in advance, to conflict with your event that she has known about for a long time.

Yeah, she is devaluing your big life event. NTA, and take this as an opportunity to see your friend for who she really is \u2014 not your friend.", "NTA you can literally get baptized any day with any pool of water. Weddings require the logistics of sometimes hundreds of people along with thousands of dollars.", "NTA. I would be hurt that she set the date so close to my wedding that she already knew about - let alone her lame ass excuse for not coming the day after.", "NTA. Too tired? Last I heard, they don't baptize babies as part of any triathlon. Your \"BFF\" sounds ridiculously selfish and flaky as fuck.", "NTA here. That sucks. I hope your friend sees she's being dumb and just comes to your celebration.", "NTA. Of course you should be upset. If my best friend knowingly scheduled an event the day before my wedding and then said she would no longer be able to attend my wedding then I would  be very hurt and would definitely make it known.  I get the feeling that this is about something else and maybe the friend is being passive aggressive?", "NTA, you're allowed to feel hurt.\n\nBut the decision has been made, and you need to accept it.\n\nIf it were me, I would very simply say, \"I'm disappointed you won't be there\" - note the Won't and not Can't (because they certainly could be there if they wanted). Then I would invite someone else to the wedding in their place. Don't let them sit on the fence about coming and then be a last minute show or no show.\n\nBTW, their excuse is lame, if anything I think you have a better reason to not go to the baptism since you are likely to be busy the day before your wedding.", "NTA. Unless there is some reason the baptism could only be held on that exact date, she\u2019s TA for planning it the same weekend as your wedding.", "NTA\n\nWho knows what\u2019s really up with her thought process. But I think you should focus on who does come. You asked, you got an answer, now move on. There is plenty of things to focus on during your celebration and a single guest isn\u2019t one of them.", "NTA\n\nMy dear she is not your friend, she literally choose the day before your wedding... she does not care about your day the least bit. You should do the same, tell her you didn't like how she treated your day as disposable and cut her off.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your friend. A baptism is not stressful full day event. It\u2019s nice and lovely but not do much test you can\u2019t a wedding the next day.

Idk how she'll be \"too tired\" to attend your wedding when it's literally the next day.", "NTA why would she not plan for the day after your wedding or another day entirely? Like she knew your plans and like youve been discussing it at length and even had an engagement party or something. She had time to pick a different day imo. You\u2019re allowed to be disappointed and upset.\n\nI know baptism for some of us can be a whole wedding like event but its a bit much to schedule it near a big event you committed being a part of.", "NTA. It sounds like she's using her son's baptism as an excuse not to go to your wedding. She'll be wrangling her kid for the baptism and I guess doesn't want to do it again the next day but that's on her she could have planned the baptism the week before or the week after your wedding but I'd say she doesn't want to attend even though you have a child friendly. She could get a babysitter for a couple hours so she can attend without the child. Even if she's breastfeeding she could pump and leave a bottle behind. I don't know if I would bring it up but I would definitely lower your expectations when it comes to her especially since she has a baby now.", "NTA - she knew your wedding's date before she scheduled the baptism. A baptism isn't like a wedding, it's not like something where you have to lock in one of a few scarce availabilities months in advance. She could have scheduled it on any other time. Also, Friday for a baptism? Every baptism I've been to has taken place during a regular church service on Sunday. Finally, she expects to be too tired out by a baptism to attend a wedding the next day?  Even with a Catholic baptism, the ceremony only takes a few minutes. Unless she's doing it as part of Friday evening Vespers instead of a standalone ceremony and she expects to stay for all of Vespers, but still, her being at Vespers would be about the same time as your rehearsal dinner, and so she'd be no more tired than if she had gone to your rehearsal dinner. Your friend is lame. Wait until she really gets experience as a parent, dance recitals on Friday night, then all day baseball tournaments on Saturday. She needs to learn to suck it up.", "Tricky one...you can be NTA and still not want to rock the boat.\n\nThat said, I'm inclined to say NTA because your *lifelong BFF* planned her kid's baptism for the day before your wedding? Like...what? Why not the week after? Why not the week before?\n\nCould there be constraints with their SO's family you aren't aware of? Like maybe the paternal grand parents could *only* come that weekend, or something?\n\nThat just seems weird to me, to not consider your best friend's wedding in planning something of your own. Like...that weekend would be \"blocked off\" for most BFFs once they knew your date.\n\nIt doesn't sound like she is in your wedding party, though? No wedding party, or she didn't crack the lineup for being a bridesmaid or maid of honour, despite BFF status? If there IS a wedding party, and she was excluded...could her planning the baptism so close be a way for her to avoid the wedding, since she felt she should be in the wedding party?\n\nVery curious about that aspect. Most \"BFFs\" are in their BFFs wedding party, especially lifelong BFF, unless there (a) is no wedding party or (b) it's siblings only (rare, but it happens).", "NTA. Honestly, it infuriates me when people don't make an effort to go to the \"big\" stuff. Like in todays society we are all so, so busy with working and school and kids and maintaining a home, it's overwhelming! But I always try to go to the \"big\" thing whenever I possibly can. Weddings, baby showers, graduations. Or when things are really bad I try to be there too. \n\nWe don't really have a society where we are going to get together weekly for tea anymore but we can show up when we are really needed and when it really counts.\n\nWill she be tired? Yeah probably. Can she suck it up and sit through a one hour ceremony and congratulate and celebrate you? Also yes. Like when did we all become so selfish? Typically I would give a new mom with a baby a pass, but you've made it a child friendly wedding and it's not because she's sleep deprived or PPD/PPA or doesn't want to find childcare, she's just...tired (in the future, maybe). \n\nI'm sorry OP because it seems like you really care about this person and she is not being a good friend to you right now at all.", "NTA\nJust seems like she doesn't want to go. It's sucks because you also took children into consideration. I would distance myself and congratulate her and focus on your wedding. Its definitely not a tiring event nor is it an all day thing unless you make it. Attend or not. She should understand your focus on your life event as she is focused on hers. You planned yours far in advance and understandably want everything to go right so yeah you need to focus.", "NTA. A true friend will attend your wedding no matter how tired.She could have scheduled the baptism on a different day, being as it appears you scheduled your wedding first.\nSome people want to continue friendships even though there are obvious signals that the friendship is not being reciprocated. It has happened to me. We ignore things because we want to keep the friendship until something is so big, we cannot ignore it any longer. A \u201c friend\u201d who refuses to attend your wedding is a huge signal. \nI would re evaluate this friendship.", "NTA does she not like your partner or something? Cause the only reason I can think of for her to plan the baptism for the day before your wedding when your wedding date was planned well in advance feels like she is using it to get out of your wedding. Especially considering baptisms are generally a short ceremony and I've never heard of someone being tired from having a baptism.\n\n So is there a reason she wouldn't be happy for you getting married?", "NTA - your friend is full of sh*t. That's absolutely not the reason she's choosing not to attend. She might be going out of her way to try to make you feel like your wedding is unimportant.

I wouldn\u2019t call her out on it because these types just become defensive and she\u2019ll probably try to turn it on you.

WHAT?? Something more might be going on that you haven\u2019t been privy to", "Yea I\u2019m going with NTA she definitely could have planned around it better. Sorry OP.", "NTA\n\nBaptisms are nothing more than mass or church where they dip the kid's head in water. Takes all of 5 minutes either during or after mass. Her excuse is lame but I'd take it as gospel to your relationship with her now. And consider the cherry on top when she doesn't send a gift, card, or money for your big day. I wouldn't tell her the excuse sucks, because both parties know that. I'd just put your friendship aside due to her weak excuse. I wouldn't give her the time of day anymore. \n\nAre you invited to the baptism?", "At the baptism: \" Thank you so much for including me in your special day.  Love you and hope to see you tomorrow - feel free to just come to the ceremony and skip all the hoopla if you're not up to it!\". Leave it at that.

No matter the reason, you are not an AH for being upset about this.", "NTA - She doesn't want to go to your wedding and needed an out.", "NTA.  There has to be something else going on here.

It's also strange that she expects you to come to her event *the day before your wedding* when you certainly have a million things to do, but she can't be bothered to show up for even just your ceremony because she'll be \"too tired\" after listening to some prayers and having a nice lunch the day before. Maybe it's time to consider whether this friend shares your opinion on how close you two are.", "Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but a baby baptism is like 30min??? Go in sprinkle sprinkle leave?

Maybe she's jealous you are getting married, while she has just had a baby with her bf and they aren't even engaged", "NTA, but you do need to realize that your friend has entered into a new phase of her life that may not include as much of you and attending your events in it. Speaking as a parent, we are terrible friends. We will forget important dates/events, we will cancel plans last minute because we're too tired to change the shirt we've had on for two days (let alone shower or go anywhere), and we will prioritize our children and the things we have going on with them over everything else. You and your friend are at different points in your life right now. She may not be a great friend to you in the same way she was before, but it's probably not because she doesn't love you.

They need a reality check, communication is key! Failing to speak to her will make the problem worse in your mind and would be kind of passive aggressive.", "NTA. This is bizarre behavior from your friend and also\u2026 it is a big deal that you are making the time to go to her son\u2019s baptism the DAY BEFORE YOUR WEDDING! What a nice gesture of friendship. For most people the day before their wedding is full of last-minute prep. Does she not see that? That to me is a much bigger deal than being a guest at a wedding the day after a big event.

Sus she scheduled the baptism right before.", "NTA, and she is not BFF. \n\nIt's ok to be disappointed in her choice.

Honestly,  the baptism is probably an attempt at a polite excuse.  Her baby will be what... five months old?  At that age,  if she's lucky,  he's sleeping most of the night,  but no guarantees there.  Baby care is time consuming,  on top of her regular life,  and even if you want to go,  it's hard to muster energy for a party,  or a wedding.  If she did go,  it's a pretty sure bet baby's going to get hungry, cranky, or stinky,  probably all three.   She will likely need to tote the kid,  diaper bag, and possibly bottles in a cooler.  Add risk of catching a bug,  especially if people still ask to hold the baby (very common when I was a new mom. I called it the Pass the Baby game.)\n\nAll of this assumes she's able to get places on time.  I used to joke I was on Baby Standard Time:  we get there when baby says it's time,  we go when baby says it's time.  \n\nI'm sure she wants to be there.   I've done weddings with a babe in arms.  It CAN be done if kiddo cooperates.  But even with an easy baby,  it's hard work. I can understand if she feels it's not a good idea with her infant and her energy.  This is a disappointment,  but I don't think she's slighting you or your wedding.  She's just got another obligation to consider.", " NTA and I would question your friends", "NTA.

One of my best friends/bridesmaids got pregnant and was due like a week after my wedding.  I 100% expected her to bow out but that girl showed up, 9 goddamn months pregnant and having braxton hicks all weekend.  She was there because that's what friends do.  You're right to feel hurt because your friend is being the AH here.", "It sounds like your BFF is upset about something, and using the baptism to get out of going to your wedding. Has she been acting differently lately?", "NTA\n\nAnd I have some questions for your friends telling you to just be quiet. I'm sorry but you sound like you're surrounded by AHs. Really you should have brought it up when she said she scheduled it the day before but... Time to burn some bridges, sadly.", "NTA\n\nI think it's a good impulse that you want to clear the air between you. Why *not* bring it up? It will always be there if you don't. You sound like a sweet person, so I'm sure that you will be able to be tactful about it. \n\nMaybe suggest that she not attend the entire wedding.

I was happy to see her get married, but I knew that I didn't have the stamina to attend the entire event.", "NTA.

What a crazy thing to tell someone LOL If you can't calmly discuss how your friend has hurt you with their actions/words, then maybe that friendship has come to an end. I don't think that's what's happening here but here's what I'll say...\n\nWrite out everything you wanna say to her, really let it rip. Get it ALLLLLL out. Then toss that letter or delete that draft. Then the next day, write it out again. That 2nd draft is probably closer to what you want to discuss with your friend.\n\nLife gets crazy & sometimes obligations make us neglect relationships. It's okay to go to your friend and say \"Can we talk about this? I'm hurt & want to resolve this.\" Don't throw accusions or anything. Go in with the goal of coming out on the other side with a stronger bond as friends. Conflict is normal, especially around major life events such as weddings & parenthood. Strong & healthy conflict resolution skills are a rarity in this world, as made clear by your friends & family telling you that this can't even be discussed.\n\nI would go in with, \"I totally get where you're coming from.

But I do think it would be fine to have a conversation with her about the fact that you're sad she won't be there since she's your best friend and you wanted her with you for this important day in your life, and maybe ask why she chose that day for the baptism. Not in a confrontational way, not to imply she did it for some bad reason, but so you'll understand and not have any lingering resentment because you don't know why she did it. Hopefully as lifelong best friends you'll be able to discuss it earnestly and openly with understanding and kindness on both sides.", "as a new mother of 2, If I was in this situation with my lifelong BFF. I would 100% make time to be there even if i was tired (which sounds like an excuse anyway) moments like this only happen once in a lifetime. so yes I know I'd be exhausted for maybe a week or so following both events but Its worth it.

It sucks she scheduled the baptism the day before the wedding when she knew the date, but with church schedules and family schedules her hands may have been tied, then between the ceremony and post-baptism family party with a small baby, I can even understand her saying she'll be super tired the next day. But with all of that in mind, I still don't think you wouldn't be out of line talking to her about it. If she's such a close friend of yours I think you can approach her with a calm, adult conversation and express your disappointment that she won't be there and genuinely asked what made her pick that day. The end result may still be that she won't be able to go, but clearing the air will definitely make you feel better about the situation. The woman has fresh baby brain, she may not be seeing things further than 10 feet in front of her and didn't take the whole situation into account.

Baptism isn't some party where you can't go to an event the next day. If someone is making it into some huge party, it's a glorified bath, not a baptism. Sacraments should be celebrated, but I can't ever see how this can get to the point of not being able to go to a wedding the next day.\n2. Friday is just weird for a baptism, normally Christians do it before/after the service on the Lords Day (Sunday). Why didn't she plan it for the sunday *after your wedding?*\n3. Why chose the day on the same weekend as a major event?\n4. Baptisms oftentimes do take place fairly soon after the birth (if the parents are both paedobaptists). However you totally have the ability to ask the pastor to wait a week since you have a conflicting event if you thought it would be a big deal.\n\nYou have every right to be annoyed at her given the info you gave.\n\nEDIT: Actually other commenters have noted, probably correctly, that since your BFF just gave birth not too long ago, she was exhausted, and probably wasn't thinking about any of this. I think the right thing for her to do is move the baptism off by a week (and do it on the Lord's Day). \n\nAlso, super weird how pushy she's being about baptism when she's having child out of wedlock.

Stupid cult.", "Info: wonder if she has post partum depression?", "NTA.   \nBaptisms are still a thing?   \nHow 10th century.", "Your friend may have something else going on which she doesn\u2019t feel like sharing. Maybe she\u2019s losing hair, can\u2019t afford to buy a dress and can\u2019t fit in her old ones, with the baby weight, maybe she doesn\u2019t feel able to leave her newborn (he will be only a few weeks old!!!) for the day, she may be struggling with breastfeeding and have fissures and blisters on her nipples, she may still have piles and pain from birth\u2026 and maybe she doesn\u2019t want to tell you when you may be having a child soon enough yourself. She may have postnatal depression or just be utterly shattered and drained.?Maybe your friend is just being considerate and taking (and leaving you) some space without giving you all the details. Graciously accept and don\u2019t take it personally\nNAH if you stop being upset.", "OP is NTA, but the friend is. She could have picked any other day. But it's for a weird religious cult thing that makes no sense, so that loses points for me as well.", "And, the \"BFF\" is also expecting OP to be at the baptism the day before OP's own wedding.  I mean, WTF?!  I don't know what OP's plans are for that day, but the day before is usually the day of the wedding rehearsal/rehearsal dinner, among other last-minute prep things.\n\nOP, has your friendship always been this one-sided?  Either way, you are NTA and sadly, I don't see this friendship continuing.", "Some times, baptism dates are scheduled by the church.  Catholic Church has them scheduled on a certain day of the week (often a Saturday or Sunday) and baptizes only on those days.  This could have been the case with BFF, and I don't know what kind of shindig BFF is planning after the baptism.  Some families it's a big deal.\n\nNew baby - yeah, I bet new Mom will be tired.  I don't know her situation.  Maybe she could have planned it better.  It happens.  New bride - yeah - she can be irritated that her BFF is opting out of her day but come on.  Is BFF the ONLY person that's going to be at the wedding/reception?  Will ALL OPs focus be on BFF?  Will BFF not being there absolutely RUIN her life?  Get a grip.  No.\n\nNow the question was - WOPBTA for \"wanting\" to tell her BFF she's disappointed?  Certainly not.  WOPBTA for actually berating BFF for not planning better?  Yes.  \n\nOP can tell BFF she is disappointed but understands and she loves her.  And then OP should focus on her wedding, her husband and her day and enjoy it and not get wound up over one person not being able to attend.  It's not like her fiance is saying he can't make it.  THEN I could see all the fuss.", "I don't think it matters if it's the same day. The friend knew when the wedding is and chose to schedule an event that would make it so she wouldn't be able to attend OP's wedding. It's the choice to schedule the baptism on a week/weekend that was already booked, which means the choice to not attend the wedding had to be made in order to choose that specific baptism day.\n\nSo OP is NTA. Her friend didn't value the importance of attending the wedding because her friend recently scheduled a personal event too close to the wedding date to be able to attend.", "agreed that the friend is showing how unimportant OP is to her. not so much about the whole being tired thing, but more so about the whole scheduling thing. the being tired business could be legit for a variety of reasons. disagreed that anything would make OP the ahole. the wedding had been scheduled for longer than the baptism.  also, it's ridiculous if OP's friend truly expects OP to attend an event the day before her own wedding.", "I don\u2019t even see how OP would be the AH if the baptism was the same day. The friend has known about this wedding since before she got pregnant. It\u2019s pretty dumb to schedule your kid\u2019s baptism the day before your friends wedding. The friend could have scheduled it a week or more before or after the wedding.", "This is a very kind approach. Definitely seems like there's more to the story with the new mom.", "My guess is it\u2019s less about feeling insecure and trying to get attention and more like OP values the relationship waaaaaaay more than the friend does and this is the first time OP has noticed.", ">Every event in their lives is precious and important but it\u2019s not reciprocated.\n\nI can't upvote this enough. People like this are exhausting and heartbreaking. The way I have showed up to so many things falling asleep or anxious I was missing study time or about how I was going to get all my own shit done, but I showed up! and when I realized other people weren't doing the same I just put a lot of space in that relationship. People like this will drain the life out of you if you let em.", "Yes, same! If my best friend or someone I loved was getting married, then I would schedule the baptism another day.", ">Or maybe she\u2019s just pulling away as a friend\n\nThat's my suspicion. I've got a lot of childhood friends who I'm still in touch with but no longer close with who've gotten married over the last few years, and there have been a handful where I could have made it if it had been a priority for me, but it would have involved a lot of travel or rescheduling something, and I realized that we just aren't that close anymore, and making it to their wedding just isn't as important to me as it would have been ten years ago", "She is two months into motherhood, she is exhausted now. She will be exhausted the day of baptism but she dosen't have much choice there its her kid and her religion. She will be exhausted the day after and the day after that. \n\nI suspect the baptism is an excuse but just the thought of a wedding seems extreme.", "Her baby is at most two months.

Usually the day before the wedding is full of last minute prep, seeing friends and family that traveled from out of town, and the rehearsal dinner. \n\nI eloped and had a group of 10 friends with us when we got married and with basically 0 plans/decor we still were super busy the day before!\n\nOP, NTA. And your friend is telling you in a roundabout way that the friendship is over or isn't important anymore. Time to listen.", "Yeah fr I think we\u2019ve all had a friend who we\u2019ve been there for but and it\u2019s not reciprocated. Maybe because you\u2019ve guys have been friends for so long you don\u2019t wanna move on or don\u2019t wanna accept that she hasn\u2019t showed up the same way you would show up for her, but it\u2019s definitely time to reconsider this friendship because as it\u2019s fair that she will be tired after the baptism. The fact that she had zero issue with planning it the day before and then doesn\u2019t wanna even attempt to show up for your event saids a lot about your place in her life. It\u2019s okay not be friends with someone who\u2019ve know for years. Don\u2019t let her walk all over you and use you when it\u2019s convenient for her.", "Because the kid's baptism _is_ important to the kid's immediate family.", "Thanks for clarifying!\n\nI hope you have a joyous day!", "A baptism isn't a \"kiddo wrangling event,\" it's about 7 minutes of an infant being dunked in water and chanted over by a guy in a dress. Hardly taxing at all.", "Baptizing a 5 month old is not really a child wrangling event.", "Yeah, it's hard to tell if OP is leaving out any further explanations from the friend regarding \"why that day\" -- and OP may not even know, because as OP said, in the moment she didn't think to ask.  What she's wondering NOW is \"why that day?\", and it's more awkward to ask about it.  If she did manage to ask, though, she might get an explanation like this.\n\nAt least based on OP's write-up, though, I'm not thinking much of the friend for not offering up the explanation and apology at the time of telling OP about the baptism date and having to bow out of attending the wedding.  Like... that seems only natural to do?  Shouldn't you know that your friend's wedding is a big deal to them?  If you said you would go, and now have to bow out, an apology and an explanation seem like a natural step?\n\nI don't think OP is an asshole for being very disappointed and not feeling valued by her friend over this.  At least, without explanation of the extenuating circumstances forcing the choice of that date for the baptism.", "I have now seen the brides comments that wedding parties aren\u2019t really a thing but I really thought this might be a factor at play here so had to Google! I\u2019m no expert, obviously, but it seems like the custom is no big wedding parties but maybe one bridesmaid so I\u2019m thinking this still could be a thing\u2026 \nI mean  - BFF goes out of her way to choose that precise date - when surely she didn\u2019t have to - and then uses tired from own event as an excuse \ud83e\udd14", "yeah exactly. I'm surprised to read through so many comments and this is the first thread that anyone has mentioned this. why the hell would OP's friend expect OP to attend?? in fact, i think OP should decline the invitation. not *only* out of petty spite, of course, but also because the day before one's wedding is often just as hectic as the day of. \n\nOP, NTA. your friend is a huge butthole. don't go to the baptism.", "Probably not at all. My guess is that she was hoping for that so then she could say they were even.", "Then the friend should have said so, and it appears she did not. As it is, OP has said she heard 'I scheduled a thing the day before YOUR big day so I'm not going to YOUR thing, but you'll be at MY thing, right?' And of course that makes OP feel like she's not valued. So maybe that's the answer, to state \"I feel like you don't value me enough to not schedule this event the day before my wedding.\" and see the response.", "Heeeey I eloped as well! We didn\u2019t tell or bring anyone but yeah we still ran errands the day before and got everything ready to go. No way I\u2019d go to someone else\u2019s event the day before. I didn\u2019t even think about a rehearsal dinner. Even more reason not to go \ud83d\ude02", "Not saying that it isn't.. but OP is supposedly someone who, after a lifetime of friendship, is likely considered family as well. The point is the \"friend\" is fine with getting support for important events that matter to her, but not equally providing the same courtesy.", "Definitely doesn\u2019t feel good at the time. \ud83d\ude05 But there are definitely friends out there that are willing to put forth the effort that OP needs in a friend. But it still totally sucks.", "It's a full mass/church service (about an hour) then the Baptism (sometimes several Baptisms), then photos, then a party with friends and family, usually including a meal. It takes days to prepare for everything, especially if the party is at their home. Plus there may be out-of-town guests.", "You have to get kiddo there and back. Kiddo will be in unfamiliar clothes, handed to someone they aren't comfortable with, and then dunked. Usually you also have to sit through mass as well, it's typically not a separate event. Also, most families celebrate immediately afterwards.\n\nSo no, that is not seven minutes.", "Why does having ppd make it understandable for the friend to knowingly plan this the day before a close friend's wedding? If she's got her wits about her enough to out together a baptism, she is lucid enough to consult a calender. Baptism/wedding isnt till july - there are no other dates for the baptism available over the course of 4-6 months???\n\nSeems like plain old selfishness/spotlight stealing.

I have an autoimmune disorder. I know what my limits are, and they\u2019re not much. I get tired EASILY and I get tired HARD.

That\u2019s two weeks of recovery right there IF I don\u2019t have another obligation also. \n\nIt\u2019s lonely, it sucks majorly.

I have been to many Catholic baptisms (contraception bad = large extended family) and most times there's been more than one child being baptised. \n\nSome priests will do the christening service after Sunday mass but they will still share with any other child due to be brought into the church.\n\nI doubt that OP's friend is Catholic though as Catholic baptisms are on Sunday except in exceptional circumstances.", "There\u2019s this magical thing called a restaurant where someone fixes the food and cleans up for you.

She did schedule it, and OP gives no indication that she offered an apology or explanation (like \"I'm so sorry, it's the only date that will work\" for XYZ reasons).\n\nOP is NTA for feeling like her friend does not value her wedding, because of intentionally counter-scheduling this other event such that it prevents her from attending the wedding that she previously said she could be at.\n\nThere are plenty of things that might come up that might prevent you from attending your BFF's wedding, that everyone just has to accept as life getting in the way.
