{"id": 14055, "submission_id": "12clbpl", "title": "AITA for being upset with my friend for choosing her son\u2019s baptism instead of my wedding?", "selftext": "I (F32) have a lifelong \u201cBFF\u201d (F32) - she and I have gone through all of life\u2019s ups and downs and still remained dear friends.\n\nAlmost three years ago I got engaged to my fianc\u00e9 (M34) - we wanted to have a big party and because of Covid (my fianc\u00e9 is an expat) we decided to wait to get married until 2023. We settled on a date in April \u201822.\n\nBFF since met her amazing boyfriend & she\u2019s just given birth to their beautiful son here in February. He is healthy and an amazing little guy-  I love him to bits.\n\nLast week BFF invited me to his baptism and told me some news - they\u2019ve chosen to have their son baptised the day before my wedding (so the baptism is on a Friday, my wedding on a Saturday) and she was \u201cpretty sure that she wasn\u2019t going to make it to my wedding because she will be too tired.\u201d\n\nIn the moment I could only focus on telling her that I was looking forward to the baptism, so I didn\u2019t mention anything about her not coming to my wedding. Since then I have stewed it over a bit and the more I think about it, the more I realise that I\u2019m actually very hurt by what I feel is a belittling of my \u201clife event\u201d. \n\nI am not a parent myself, so I am sure that there are some unwritten rules for parenthood that take precedence over friendship & I understand that they could have chosen that particular date for sentimental reasons. However, I feel like she could have made arrangements with her boyfriend for the day after & that they could have planned better. I feel like she views my wedding as insignificant compared to their baptism, even though both events are important happenings in our respective lives. I feel like she\u2019s using her son\u2019s baptism as a bad excuse or she\u2019s struggling with something and isn\u2019t telling me about it - and it sucks that she hasn\u2019t thought of this.\n\nI have asked for advice from some of my friends, on whether or not I should bring this up to her and most have outright told me that it\u2019s wrong of me to even want to bring up to my friend that I would like to see her on my wedding day even if she is tired.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting to bring it up to her that I\u2019m disappointed that she\u2019s dropping out of my wedding, because her son\u2019s baptism is the day before? That I\u2019m hurt that it feels like I am supporting/showing up to her life and her major events, but she doesn\u2019t support/showing up to mine?\n\nTL;DR:\nMy best friend since childhood scheduled her son\u2019s baptism the day before my wedding and is now pulling out of said wedding because she\u2019ll be too tired after the baptism. I am hurt because she\u2019s known about the wedding longer than she\u2019s been pregnant. AITA for wanting to tell her that I\u2019ll be hurt and disappointed if she doesn\u2019t show up?\n\nEdit: Just to add, I have already been called an asshole by my other friends, for even thinking about bringing it up which is why I don\u2019t know if I even should be mad/upset about this.\n\nSecond edit: \nI think I should have added that the wedding isn\u2019t until first weekend of July - I would not expect her to be ready for a baptism this fast, much less a whole day event like a wedding (which I don\u2019t expect her to attend the entirety of). \n\nWe have also gone to great lengths to make the first part of our wedding child-friendly (the ceremony and the reception) since we are in our early 30\u2019s and have many friends that are either pregnant, parents to newborns and toddlers or people who just have children. Our friends have been encouraged to bring their children so they don\u2019t have to worry about finding a sitter.", "created_utc": 1680703221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12clbpl/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_friend_for_choosing/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which she planned after already knowing your wedding was the next day. Sounds like she is using her child as an excuse to getting out of your wedding.", "NTA. I don't think it's too much to ask for a lifelong friend to attend your wedding. Further, you scheduled your wedding well in advance of her child's baptism. It seems like she's using it as an excuse to not attend your wedding but still wants you to attend her kid's baptism?\n\nShe sounds super selfish. I know for a damn fact that baptisms have a lot more flexibility in scheduling than weddings. She could have chosen a different date.\n\nUltimately, it's her right to not attend your wedding, but that doesn't mean you can't have hurt feelings. I would tell her your feelings and see if she'll change her mind. If not, she definitely sucks.", "NTA.  I cant quite understand being so exhausted from a baptism that she couldn\u2019t attend your wedding.  I can see her not staying long but to not come at all seems strange to me.  In the end, her scheduling is her decision and her not coming to your wedding is her decision also.  But I can understand your being hurt.", "Honestly I wouldn't go. Just tell her with your wedding the next day you will be too busy and want to be well rested for your event. Wish her well and tell her she will be missed on your big day and then just let it all go. People change. Priorities change. No one has to be as excited as you for your own life events. The timing is definitely suspicious but like I said before I would just let it go. And definitely don't go to the baptism.", "NTA- she\u2019s not even busy the day of just the day before. Don\u2019t go to the baptism and drop the rope with this friend. A best friend shows up with bells on a friend shows up. She\u2019s doing neither. She\u2019s not even acting like a friend. Motherhood is tiring but that\u2019s no excuse to miss your best friends wedding when it\u2019s the next day. She\u2019s not even actually tired she\u2019s planning on it. Planning on being tired is just code for not wanting to do something. It\u2019s selfish on her part plain and simple. I\u2019d voice your feelings to your friend and then drop the rope. If she comes around great if not don\u2019t go to the baptism. Enjoy your wedding and be around people who actually love and support you enough to show up.", "This has only been posted for 15 minutes, and I already don't understand all of the Y T A.  If it was the same day, then yes, you would be the AH.  But, I really don't understand what they are doing at a baptism that would make them \"too tired\" to attend a wedding *the next day.*  I think your friend is showing you how important your friendship actually is to her. NTA.", "NTA. Too tired from a baptism is an excuse she concocted when she planned the baptism a day before your wedding. She just doesn\u2019t want to go to the wedding. No need to bring it up.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a schedule conflict which I\u2019d understand.  It\u2019s her saying she\u2019ll be too tired?!? \n\nFor a good friend I\u2019d have some strong coffee and at least go for part of it, letting you know in advance how much you can commit to.  \n\nI\u2019d not go to the baptism because of some sudden \u201cwedding obligations\u201d.  She may not bat an eye because maybe she\u2019s not a good friend that really cares.  But if you go to the Baptism & she doesn\u2019t come to the wedding I\u2019d guess you\u2019ll forever feel resentful? \n\nSometimes people show us how little we really mean to them.  Take notice & don\u2019t fight it.  Just accept it and move on.", "Bringing it up? There are lots of ways that you can bring it up. There's the \"I can't beleive you counter scheduled\" way. There's the \"its a shame you can't be there. I'll miss you.\" way. There's the \"I hope that you aren't as tired as you anticipate. If that's the case and it turns out that you can attend, I'll leave a seat for you at the head table.\" way.\n\nSome of them are asshole ways, some aren't. But not expressing your regard for her, not expressing that you'll miss her would be an asshole move.\n\nNTA", "Obviously NTA. They could\u2019ve chosen a different date for the baptism. This just feels like the first example of you being tossed aside because there is a baby.", "NTA \\~ I **assume** you settled the wedding on a date before your friend decided to plan her religious day on a day earlier. Cause this will certainly set the *intention* of that friend.  \nShe wont be tired from the baptism, its just an excuse, and a manipulative way to seek attention, this makes her feel more superior and less insecure.  \nBy the way, you are way to busy with your wedding, even the day(s) before the big day.  \nDon't give her the validation and admiration she's begging for, she is manipulative and has malicious intent.", "NTA because I can\u2019t imagine how a kid\u2019s baptism would makes it\u2019s parents \u201ctoo tired\u201d to do anything the next day. Even if you have a party, it\u2019s the kind of occasion where you might have a cake & a nice meal, not a huge late night drink fest. You\u2019re probably right that something else is going on. That \u201csomething else\u201d might be being the parent of a 2 month old who doesn\u2019t sleep through the night or it might be something else.", "NTA. Weddings are expensive, and deposits were probaly made to prevent you from shifting the date. Baptism on the other hand, you can\u00b4t prepare more them 9 months in advanced, and if shes just telling you about this now, sorry, but she didn\u00b4t want to attend this wedding. Consedering the fact that you guys are this clse, she was probaly standing in your wedding, and plannintg to stand in someone wedding for 3 years before backing out for something that may be rescheduled, is a total ashhole move. But, if this is her choice, you should respect that. YWBTA if you get mad though, because again, it\u00b4s her choice.", "NTA she isn't choosing the baptism over your wedding, she is choosing to have a rest day because she *might* be tired over your wedding.  WAY different", "NTA\n\nYour friend clearly doesn't care that much about your wedding if she isn't even going to go because she is tired. If she did care she could have just had the baptism on the next weekend or something.\n\nDon't go to the baptism, accept that you guys aren't really that good friends.", "Info: is there a particular reason they chose that day? How long have you had your specific date planned?\nIs there any travel involved?", "NTA for wanting the conversation. If my BFF arranged for an important event the day before my already established wedding (and subsequently said she would not attend my wedding), I would definitely be curious as to why. I would at least want to have to conversation to see if there was anything that could be done... There's a reason here...I don't think it's a coincidence.", "NTA, it's a clear slight. She may be your BFF but it's pretty apparent you are not her's, Sorry.", "NTA -- There's nothing wrong with wanting your friend to know how you feel about this situation. The important part is what she does with that information and how you respond", "NTA I thought they were on the same day and she was forced to choose. She actually CAN attend both but just\u2026 doesn\u2019t wanna? She isn\u2019t your friend.", "NTA. Firstly, you are entitled to feel any way you feel. It's what you do about those feelings that matter. But, secondly, you can tell your friend how your feeling and how upset you are by her decision. Maybe she has no control over the date of the baptism, maybe she did. But, as your friend, she could have considered your feelings when choosing. As your friend, she could offer to attend your ceremony if not the reception or some compromise in an effort to support you in your life event. Is this relationship one-sided?", "NAH. You are not an AH to be hurt. It seems like something else is going on with your friend and she was looking for a good reason not to go because she didn\u2019t want to just say no to going to the wedding. Maybe she has PPD. Maybe she is just exhausted from taking care of a baby. Or maybe there is something else going on. Confronting her is unlikely to be productive. Let her know that you will really miss her and wait until you are both in a better headspace to talk about it.", "NTA: even if the baptism was the SAME DAY as the wedding, supposed BFF could at least show up to your reception.  She could hire a sitter.", "It kind of kills the friendship. Was your friend supposed to be in your wedding party? Was she angry you didn\u2019t include her?\n\nIf she\u2019s skipping the wedding, you\u2019re too busy and skip the baptism. Let her know and ask why she didn\u2019t choose a different date that didn\u2019t conflict.", "Was the friend part of the wedding party? I would be upset if a bridesmaid did this so close to the wedding - if it was just a close friend, I would be annoyed; but she\u2019s not ruining anything if she is just a guess", "NTA. It\u2019s not the baptism your friend prioritizes. But it\u2019s the recovery/aftermath of it that she can\u2019t handle. \n\nWhen you\u2019re going to bring that up, preferably don\u2019t use  disappointed. Being disappointed is only a result of your own expectations. Just tell her that you are going to miss her on that day and you think it\u2019s sad that she won\u2019t be joining.", "NTA. \nYou set a date for your wedding in April 2022, so even before she knew about the baby. She could\u2019ve set the date for the baptism a weekend before or after your wedding. So it was done on purpose. \n\nYou can either let it go and just tell her you can\u2019t make it to the baptism because of wedding preparations and accept her not coming to yours. \n\nBut you say she\u2019s your bff so maybe just ask her.", "NTA. I think she\u2019s telling you how she feels about you and I would listen. People move on and things change when you have kids. Personally, I don\u2019t think having kids should automatically make you an asshole. However, that seems to be the case with your friend. If you want to try and save the friendship, you will have to talk this out with her. I just don\u2019t know how you reason with someone who is for whatever reason, extremely selfish.", "NTA. Real friends communicate their feelings. Bad advice from your \u201cfriends.\u201d Does she not understand you will be tired Friday? Preparing for wedding the day before is usually crazy, and you are carving out time for her event. I\u2019d be hurt if my friend refused to come to.", "NTA\n\nComing from a culture where weddings are several days of back to back events, I don't really buy being tired from the day before as a legit excuse. Baptisms are during the day. Is she planning to be hungover from this religious event? It's confusing to me and you have every right to be upset. If it's something you care about you make an effort. She's already decided it's not worth her energy. \n\nI'd say let her do what she wants and distance yourself going forward. People's true colors come up when you need them", "NAH. You being upset is a natural reaction, but I don't blame a new Mother for not being able to go to a wedding a couple of months after birth. She's likely exhausted.", "NTA I have kids, who are baptized, I would never schedule something that would make me miss my BFFs wedding. Most churches have multiple dates for sacraments. She's not your BFF, sorry.", "NTA\n\nThe schedule chosen was intentional\u2014if they were under pressure to take it as it was the only slot left in the *entire* calendar of *all* churches within city radius (lol) she would have added that to her explanation to assure you that it wasn't by choice;\n\nThe weirdass \"I will be tired\" reason is lame, the \"pretty sure\" makes it absurd\u2014how long is a typical baptismal event in Denmark, the whole day?? She doesn't even have to stay during your entire wedding+reception. I hope she doesn't have any role assigned to her that she's quitting as well.\n\nAnd her telling you was more an FYI rather than an extremely remorseful apology and with regret that she'll miss out on your special day.\n\nYou're not as close as you think you are. Honestly, I don't think I'd be enthused to go to the baptism and have bad feelings ferment the whole time which may affect my mood for the following day. I'd rather rest and be mentally supercharged for the excitement on Saturday.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think this is probably just about a baptism. Your friend may also feel overwhelmed by motherhood, new babies drain you in ways that overwork does not. It\u2019s a shock to the system. Your friend may also feel overwhelmed about either bringing baby to the wedding or uncomfortable about having another person watch the baby while they go to the wedding. If I were you, I would schedule a time to go visit my friends house. While you are there, just love on them. Do her dishes or fold some laundry. Hold the baby for an hour so she can go nap. Drop off a casserole so she doesn\u2019t have to cook that night. Show her that you see how hard things are right now. Acknowledge how tired she is right now and how hard is working. Tell her she\u2019s doing a great job. And perhaps lower your expectations. Don\u2019t force this friend to be in the bridal party or stand and pose for pics for hours. Let her know you support her fully - if she is planning to bring baby, do you have a room set aside for nursing and a place she can rest? Let her know it\u2019s fine if she can only stop by for either the ceremony or part of the reception. Let her know it\u2019s fine for her to show up in whatever clothes she is comfortable in. In my experience, for some cultures, baptism is treated like a wedding. With a long ceremony, followed by a reception with music, food, and dancing. Baptisms and weddings are both considered very serious events in the eyes of many churches. But yes, it\u2019s weird the only time the church could have baby\u2019s baptism was literally the day before your wedding. Probably something else going on. Best wishes on your happy day! I know this bothers you, but I hope you will not let it detract from this joyous occasion of being joined together with your fianc\u00e9!!", "I would not bring it up to her. She has clearly made up her mind. I understand that you are hurt, and losing such a close friend when you need her support the most is painful. But hopefully your life will take you in a direction where you will make new friendships and be able to have these connections with people that can reciprocate what you bring to the relationship. As for me, I would not attend her child\u2019s baptism either. You will be incredibly busy with your wedding stuff to worry about her needs. She\u2019s known about your wedding for over a year, and she chose the date of her child\u2019s baptism. It sounds like she is moving on from your friendship, so you should do the same. Seeing her the day before knowing she won\u2019t attend your wedding will only serve to upset you further, and will more than likely ruin your wedding day. Keep your wedding day for you, let go of that hurt and look forward to a hopeful and promising future with your husband instead.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA, but also I\u2019d send a text saying something like \u201cI looked at my schedule for wedding prep and unfortunately will be too busy doing {some vaguely wedding related thing, get a massage, get your nails done, etc.} to be able to attend a baptism the day before my wedding. Hope it\u2019s everything you want it to be\u201d and then just focus on yourself and having fun. Don\u2019t make it about her not coming to your wedding, because it\u2019s not really about that. It\u2019s about her choosing to schedule life things without any regard to your life things. And that sucks from a bff! So maybe she should be demoted from bff status.", "NTA\n\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d is a narcissist.  They can\u2019t do the baptism the weekend before?  It absolutely has to be the day before?  That was really rude of her to pick that day.  It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t know when your wedding is when picking the date for the baptism.  She is being super selfish.  The world doesn\u2019t revolve around her and her new baby.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, you shouldn\u2019t go the baptism.  You have a full day the next day and should be able to spend the day before preparing.", "Is your friend okay? If you really where besties this wouldntve happened. Methinks your friends boyfriend is telling her she cant/shouldnt go. Her baptism excuse is just that. I hope its bad faith rather than bad situation. NTA tho", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry that you feel this way but I agree and would think the same way you\u2019re feeling. And if she\u2019s as good as a friend as you say she is then she should understand and appreciate you bringing it up to her. I think your friends that are saying it\u2019s an issue are shitty friends. I would 100 out of 100 times rather my friend question something that may be going on with me. And to be to tired to go to your wedding is just bs to me. Good luck and if she doesn\u2019t go to your wedding than just do your best to enjoy yourself", "NTA the whole thing reeks of someone trying to belittle your life events. You sure she's a friend? \n\nAlso how are you going to go to a baptism the day before your wedding? From memory that day was one of the most stressful days ever.", "NTA - it\u2019s okay to express to her how you\u2019re feeling, as long as you don\u2019t get mad at her for how she responds. Your feelings are valid regardless of if they are \u201crational\u201d or not. I suggest talking to your friend, telling her you understand her position but feel personally hurt. I hope you guys can have a good conversation and find some kind of compromise", "NTA, but, she might have ppd. Or doesn\u2019t feel like she could handle a full day of wedding festivities. I would say it\u2019s not personal.", ">I feel like she views my wedding as insignificant compared to their baptism, even though both events are important happenings in our respective lives.\n\nAnd you view her baptism as insigificant compared to your wedding. That's okay, you live separate lives.\n\nAn invitiation to your wedding is an offer, not a summons. If someone can come, great. If they can't, that's no problem either.\n\nFor you, her baptism seems a smaller event, not that far away. But for her, it may be a hugely more significant event and a lot more draining. Perhaps they've got family coming from far away, people staying, lots to arrange and see to. \n\nAs a new mother, things can be absolutely exhausting, let alone without a huge public event to organise and attend. She probably doesn't want to commit to two events back to back, especially if she can't give both the attention she'd want to. \n\nDon't become a bride-zilla about this. You invited her, she said she doesn't think she can make it. That's life. NAH.", "NAH. Depending on the denomination, churches are blocked literally 12+ months out, and it sounds like she\u2019s struggling with potential PPD and the guilt/stigma around PPD. She may also be doing the baptism at a church where it is a full affair with parental classes etc. beforehand. \n\nI\u2019ve had PPD twice and it took 2 years for me to feel even close to normal with my oldest.", "She's a new mother and doesn't want to leave her baby. It is not a slight to you. It's very common to be extremely hard to leave a new baby.", "NTA. She may very well be tired the day after, but I'm stuck on why she would schedule the baptism the day before your wedding when she knew the date far in advance. I've never held a baptism so I don't know what all goes into planning/scheduling it, but it can't be anything close to planning a wedding. Why couldn't she have it the weekend before or after the wedding? She's not a very good friend.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your best friend if she is willing to miss a big event like you getting married.", "NTA \n\nShe could have planned the baptism any other day but she literally told you that they choose the day before the wedding . So why didn't she just choose the week after ? \n\nIf she can't come to your wedding it kinda kills your long friendship because that's a major life event. \nSo i completely understand you being angry about it.", "NAH:\n\nYour friend gave birth in February. It is likely that she is exhausted EVERY day. My guess is that when the baptism was scheduled, your wedding date was the last thing on her mind. This was not intended to dis you. It was the reality of having a major medical event, coming home with a newborn, dealing with her own relatives, scheduling with her place of worship for the baptism. I don't think it was her intention to slight you.\n\nThat said, you have every right to be disappointed that your friend will not be able to attend your wedding. Try to be understanding. Even IF the baptism were not the day before your wedding, the chances that she would not be able to attend would be high. She may not want to bring an unvaccinated newborn to a large, public event. She may not be ready to leave her newborn with somebody else, especially if she is breastfeeding. She is also feeding her newborn every 2-3 hours, changing diapers, EVERYTHING that entails having a newborn.\n\nIn summery, you have the right to be disappointed that your friend will miss your wedding. You also need to understand that she has a tiny human being who is completely dependent on her. That little person now is her priority. Attend the baptism if you can. Let her know you would love it if she can attend your wedding but accept if she is not able to do so. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming Wedding.", "Nta, um what kind of baptism are they doing that they need a day to recover from? They're on different days.  She should be able to do both.", "NTA  having had many newborns myself I can tell you they are exhausting but if your friends really cares about you she would make the effort to be there if she can't it really shows how little she values you and you have to adjust your friendship and what it means accordingly", "NTA. I would take this as a comment on the friendship.", "This may be unpopular, but NAH.\n\nIt sucks that she wasn't able to schedule the baptism on a different day (although I'm not sure how much leeway there is in different churches ) It sucks that she either can't or doesn't want to go to your wedding. This must feel incredibly hurtful and it makes sense that you would be upset.\n\nHowever, I can also see from her perspective that it sounds like she's probably going through a tough time. I don't know how big of an event a baptism is in her faith (like, is there a big family party? Or just an appointment with the priest?) but I would not think it's something that would ordinarily make her too tired to go to a wedding the next day. If she's anticipating being that tired, there's a good chance she's exhausted from having a newborn. She might be too tired to go to a wedding but doesn't know how to talk about it. She might not be able to afford a babysitter or feel uncomfortable with one. Babies are exhausting. I feel for her.\n\nMaybe find a way to reach out to her if it's a friendship worth keeping.", "INFO: when is the baptism/wedding? I ask because I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s more to it. \n\nShe had her baby in February so it\u2019s at most 2 months old. Depending when the wedding and baptism are, baby could still be quite young. With that in mind, a few things to consider. Baby is probably not sleeping through the night yet and if she\u2019s breast feeding, night wakings are solely on her. Add the baptism to that and her being exhausted is understandable.

Kiddo wrangling events always are, especially if you add in family on top of that. \n\nBuuuut. She knew the date of the wedding and could have made plans on a different day so she could still rest.\n\nNTA.", "OP said in a comment that the friend had a difficult delivery and may have ppd. This could explain how she would know she'd be tired.", "Doesn't really matter. What adult hasn't pulled through while exhausted for one reason or another? So her not doing it, and making excuses a month before the fact, just means it's not important enough.", "Yeah, it's so incredibly selfish and disrespectful that I can't believe some people are calling OP the asshole.", "Where I am from (Italy), the day of baptism is a celebration almost as big as a \"not excessively elaborate\" wedding. Big cake, relatives from different Italian regions, multiple food options in a nice restaurant, there is a long mass in the morning (or afternoon, it depends) and then the lunch/dinner is genuinely very big. Also very expensive gifts, usually golden religious jewelry and money (a lot of young people have as savings the \"baptism money\" still).\n\nRegardless, I think the \"\"\"friend\"\"\" planning shows that she just doesn't care about OP.", "In that case waiting so long is highly irresponsible.", "Oh, I'm sure she will be tired.  But, barring an actual illness or something, to me, that's not a good enough excuse.  New parents power through exhaustion every day, they have no choice.  And this isn't just a house party that OP is throwing and is upset that her friend can't attend.  This is the *wedding* of a life long friend.  A wedding that's been planned for over a year.  This should be something that her friend powers through her exhaustion for, even if it's just really briefly.", "To be fair, if we\u2019re going with tradition, they\u2019re usually not on Fridays.", "I come from a very religious family. Baptism means everyone shows up at church, some stand around the font while the baby gets water put on them, and then we all go out to lunch. She would have the whole afternoon to rest after that.", "We don't know that. The scheduling of the baptism could have everything to do with extended family schedules, church availability or just the fact that a mother who has a difficult birth and has a newborn isn't capable of taking other people into consideration when making her plans, especially if she's suffering from ppd. You're making a rash judgemental call in her motives", "Agre", "It's April, which, this year, is Easter. Many days are blocked off.

Talk to your friend and figure out if there is something else. Maybe she's just tired as a new mom and this is a convenient excuse.  How you deliver the conversation will determine the AH.", "OP, she probably has a lot of guilt about potential PPD and trying to manage it. PPD is often called a silent killer among parents because of the stigma around it and the high suicide rates in moms.", "Curious if you asked her to be in the wedding party or not?", "Right, she's CHOOSING not to do something over the possibility of something happening.  \n\nWhat an awful friend.  A good friend would be open to hearing how OP feels affected by her actions.  But instead, here we are.", "She can't pump?  At all?\n\nEdit to add that in other comments, OP mentions that she has told said friend that she can bring the baby.", "My wife breastfeeds but made it to her BFF wedding after 3 weeks of giving birth.

No big deal.", "She's already invited you to the baptism, is hers the all day and night type?", "I wanted understanding and the space to be exhausted without hurting feelings. I had **one** friend who had PPD on the same scale I did, and it almost broke her the same way it broke me. \n\nIf you have the mental and physical capability for it, I would also recommend asking if she needs a sitter so she can go do something by herself - or offer to find a sitter she can trust. I completely lost myself in being a mom the first 3-4 years I was a parent and it was only getting to do things alone that helped me realize I was in over my head trying to push aside my own needs.", "She\u2019s a bridezilla bc she wants her best friend to be at her wedding that she\u2019s been planning for for 3 years? Yeah ok (Insert eye roll here).", "Your are correct in pointing that out, but I went with her wording of the situation which includes the word \"choose\" which means that she decided on that date out of a range of available dates. \n\nIf that is not the case then my point would change but for that OP would need to write the post different or add an extra explanation to it. Because again from the wording it does nor sound like a \"only time available\" or similar problem.", "I think a (gentle) conversation is what\u2019s needed. Your feelings are valid, but I suspect there\u2019s more to it than just \u201cI\u2019ll be too tired.\u201d No assholes here, imo. Just two friends each trying to navigate big life events.", "Then what\u2019s the problem? She\u2019s just going to be a normal guest with no responsibilities.

At this point, the kid will be 5-ish months old,  you're not asking her to come to a wedding 2 months after giving birth.  You're definitely NTA.", "I did think it was in April, so that changes thinks slightly. But also, she might not be in a place where she feels like she can rsvp right now. She's probably so tired right now she can't imagine being able to attend the wedding. Why not just say something like \"I understand if you can't commit to coming. Hopefully you'll have the energy to come to the ceremony.\"", "It makes me laugh a bit how there seems to be a cultural tinge to this situation and how you interact with each other. Blunt, chilled out almost unsentimental Danes... \n\n\"FYI I won't be attending your wedding.\" \n\n\"If you ask you're an AH.\" \n\n\"Ok she's not going :-)\"\n\nIt feels funny that I feel more offended for you loll but you seem sweet and chill about it all. Your friend's lucky (deserved or not).", "Awww I really hope it works out for you, because you seem like a great friend to her!", "True they could have taken the next date.  They didn't though.  When we got my daughter baptized she was already 6 months old, if we didn't take that date the next available she would have been almost 10 months old lol. \n\nThen also depending on the family sometimes there is alot of pressure from family to get it done as soon as possible. Which is super weird to me but it happens.  My wife is Italian, her family was pretty much asking us when the baptism would be within a week of our kid being born haha.", "Yeah because having a baby is fucking tiring", "It's not super easy to schedule a baptism. She's probably tired because she just had a literal baby", "I see. In that case, I\u2019ll give bestie the benefit of the doubt and say NAH. As you said in the comments she had a hard birth, plus it\u2019s only been about 2 months so I\u2019m sure she\u2019s still adjusting to being a new mom. You\u2019re absolutely not wrong for wanting her at your wedding, and I understand being a little hurt that she couldn\u2019t come. She\u2019s also not wrong for wanting a little time to rest. I\u2019d send her best wishes, tell her she will be missed and that you hope she can try to make an appearance if possible. Congrats newlyweds!", "Maybe she will be tired, maybe not. The thing is she won\u2019t know until day of. \n\nHad she told OP \u201chey I have this baptism the day before, if I am too tired from everything I may have to miss the wedding, or only come for the ceremony\u201d is at least trying instead of making the pre planned idea of already being tired.", "A baptism of a baby isn\u2019t a kid wrangling event. It\u2019s about 5 minutes of standing there while the baby has water put on them.

I got that mixed up first too.", "That was what I thinking as well - I was honestly just very surprised that my other friends thought I was an asshole for even wanting to bring up the fact that I\u2019ll miss her at the wedding and that I don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t even attend for the ceremony and/or the reception for an hour or so (and where all ages are welcome because a lot of my friends are new parents and don\u2019t want to/can\u2019t find sitters).", "Now I feel like crying; I think I\u2019ll call her tonight and check in with her. \n\nI\u2019m worried about all my friends who are new parents, especially for this reason. :-(", "Some of her family will probably be there all night (they love keeping the party going), but she will likely dip out after a few hours if she feels like it. :-)", "I have no idea why I a man have more empathy for this brand new mother but yes she\u2019s a bridezilla because she\u2019s making her friends health a well-being about her.

Why can't she show up to support her friend the day after her own event? I don't understand at all how OP is supposedly asking her friend to choose between her and the child. The excuse that she will be too tired? Give me a break. She could show up and at least be there for the ceremony to support her supposed BFF.", "I thought the wedding was in April. So yes, she definitely might feel differently in three months.", "Good advice, thank you! :-) \n\nI can totally understand that it would be overwhelming and decisions can be insanely exhausting because as a new parent you would already be exhausted - given everybody\u2019s responses I think I\u2019ll definitely talk to her and see if something more is going on/if I can help her with some of her own baptism planning and lighten her burden a bit and also let her know that I\u2019ll be sad that she\u2019s not there because she means a lot to me, but I also understand if it\u2019s overwhelming.", "Some people are not willing to wait a few months for the singular wedding of their life long friend. Others are good friends.", "I don't know...I feel like if this friendship was important to her, she would make a point to be there for OP.  If it was the same day, or if the wedding was child-free and she didn't have someone to watch her child, then it would be a different story.  I just feel like the friend is showing OP how little she actually cares for OP by not even saying, \"I will do my absolute best to be there\".  She just straight up is saying that she will be too tired.", "Thank you, both for the advice and for the wishes! :-)", "Do you have kids?\n\nCause my partner does, I don't.

It's usually an event with family. Usually with multiple kids there watching too, and typically a potluck or some such for the family after too. \n\nI'm not even Catholic and I know that it's more than five minutes. You have to get them there and home, and it's a whole ceremony with them in clothes they aren't familiar with. \n\nI'm still saying OP is NTA.

It\u2019s loud it\u2019s bright it\u2019s chaotic. She\u2019s taking care of herself and her family you as her supposed BFF should support her. Your wedding is not your marriage.

Or dealt with a baptism? It\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like a wedding with less fun and more work. All I had to do was raise my niece when I was 13-18 and she was a fresh newborn and lemme tell you the work involved is exhausting. I can only imagine what a mom who gave birth must feel like. Weak body, PPD, emotional irregularities. Y\u2019all think having a baby is the same as getting a puppy.", ">She just straight up is saying that she will be too tired.\n\nBecause she will be. She just had a baby. She's doing a whole event with the baby AND with family - hosting is also tiring af. Girl is probs running on 3 hours of sleep as is. I don't think she's not going because she doesn't care about OP. She's choosing herself which is totally reasonable.", "Yes, we have gone to great lengths to make the first part of our wedding child-friendly, since we have many friends who have newborns, are pregnant or have toddlers. :-)", "I truly don\u2019t understand why you think I\u2019m making her choose between me and her son; I would never make her do that.", "Just a difference of opinion I guess.  I personally understand OP's feelings.  I would feel hurt too.", "Then why can\u2019t you understand she can\u2019t make it to your wedding because of him? Why do your other friends thin your an AH for this? And if I, a stranger, feel this way I\u2019m pretty sure your purported BFF would feel this way too. Your alleged friend is a new mom I dunno her situation but I do know breast feeding is exhausting carrying around a 6-20 lbs person who flails around like a sack of potatoes is exhausting. Not to mention doing that in heels. Even if she didn\u2019t have a baptism the day before, all of what I just described is grounds to say \u201csorry boo I just can\u2019t make it. I thought I could but I don\u2019t have the capacity. Being a mom is harder than I thought I love you and I\u2019ll be rooting for you.\u201d Just stop looking at it from the perspective of \u201ciTs My DaY!\u201d Because it\u2019s her whole ass life.
