You don't get to claim a patch of water, the jetskiers had every right to be there. You were in public (I'm not going to debate public nudity, since that isn't the issue at hand)\n\nYour daughter was embarrassed, and you could easily have covered yourself. You ruined the day.", "You're a bit of an asshole to embarrass your kids like that tbf the sea isn't your personal space either YTA", "YTA. Its not personal space, its public space.

YTA.", "YTA - I get enjoying some clothing-optional time, as I frequently do the same, but there's a line, and that's where you're pushing it onto someone else. You were out in the middle of nowhere, but you weren't in a distinctly private space, so you should've known there was a chance that other people might come by, and been ready to cover up briefly when they did so.", "I understand nudist beaches are where pretty much where everyone goes nude. This was not a nudist beach therefore other people recreating there certainly wouldn't reasonably expect to see your naked body on full display. There is no such thing as personal space in a public setting. If you can be charged with indecent exposure standing on your own porch or in the window naked then you certainly can be charged for being naked out in open in a public setting. All it takes is someone willing to press charges.\n\nAlso, the concept of no one getting naked except mom feels odd to me. This feels like some form of exhibitionism.\n\nYour children are well into the age where this might make them feel uncomfortable. The fact that they objected to others seeing your naked body but not themselves doesn't mean they don't mind. It means they don't feel comfortable setting boundaries with the woman who refused to cover herself for total strangers. What hope would they have you respecting their wishes? None. You got mad because your daughter was embarrassed by your absurd behavior and claimed it spoiled your day. Your behavior is teaching them they don't have a choice.\n\nYou sound like a boundary stomper. Not only did your child ask you to cover up but your husband was giving you ongoing feedback about how close they were and that there was a child present because he thought you should want to cover up as well.\n\nWhat you did was technically a crime. You don't get to expose your naked body to someone else's child and the ask if you're the AH. No one else's child should have to look at that because you want to strut around naked in a public setting. If the parent wanted to, they could have filed charges against you.\n\nIs pushing your naked body on family members and strangers alike worth serving 30 days in jail and/or being placed on the sexual offender's registry? If so, you want to explore why this is such an issue for you.\n\nQuick question, are your husband and children permitted to go naked in public or just you?

Put some clothes on.  Why you'd even be skinny dipping in the first place boggles the mind!  Why the hell would you be doing that randomly in the day, just wear a swimsuit like a normal person.
