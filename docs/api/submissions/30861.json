My dad remarried, and even though it was to the person he cheated on my mom with, and I was the best man at my dad\u2019s wedding and never cast judgement on him for what he did. \n\nSince my parents\u2019 divorce, I lived with my mom (who doesn\u2019t speak to my dad) and recently moved into my own place. But I always kept things cool with my dad. He lives about an hour away with my stepmom and her two kids. \n\nRecently, I\u2019ve become more insistent on knowing what my dad\u2019s estate plan looks like. The reason for this is I\u2019m hoping to buy a house one day and maybe go to law school. I want to understand my family\u2019s financial position before taking those risks.\n\nMy stepmom is much younger than my dad and will almost certainly outlive him. It became clear after many infuriating conversations with my dad that there was, in fact, no plan. He lied to me repeatedly about there being a plan years ago, and when he finally fessed up and went to an estate planner at my insistence, he won\u2019t send me the documents he allegedly signed.\n\nHis \u201cplan\u201d now is to ask my stepmom, who hates me, to divide her assets by 4 when she dies to be split evenly among me, my brother, and her two kids. But she can change it after my dad dies and my dad is OK with that. \n\nObviously I am not, as it means my brother and I will get nothing. I told my dad I would not spend time with him or my stepmom and stepbrothers if he intends to leave them everything. He said he actually is leaving me and my brother some money through his retirement accounts, and I was being greedy and inconsiderate of his reasons for wanting to leave the majority of his assets to his wife. He is extremely angry that I won\u2019t come to Thanksgiving and won\u2019t speak to my grandparents either who are coming to California for the first time in 20 years. \n\nIf it matters, my stepmom has no education income other than alimony from a previous marriage. She is from another country. And my stepbrothers have a dad who is independently wealthy.\n\n\nEDIT: I also told my dad if he dies penniless and leaves nobody anything that would be fine with me. But if he has money, and gives it all to her, I\u2019ll be fucking pissed. I live in CA so no matter what, the real estate pretty much guarantees that will not happen. I think it\u2019s reasonable to factor that into my own financial planning. YMMV. \n\nAlso, I paid for my own college. I\u2019ve never gotten money from my dad and don\u2019t expect to until he\u2019s dead, which I hope is a long time from now. Everyone else: my brother, my stepbrothers, his parents and brother, all take thousands if dollars from him a month. I\u2019m the only person in the family other than him who is financially independent.

Nobody is, except his wife. People get to leave their money to who they want, and the only exception is actual spousal shares. In other words, even if he tried to write his current spouse out of his will (which is apparently what you want), she would still be entitled to a share anyway under spousal share laws. The absolute entitlement of not talking to someone because they aren\u2019t leaving you money is absurd.", ">He said he actually is leaving me and my brother some money through his retirement accounts, and I was being greedy and inconsiderate of his reasons for wanting to leave the majority of his assets to his wife.   \n  \nFunny thing about this statement is that the retirement account disbursement was likely set up well before you had these conversations with him, and now that you\u2019ve told him you\u2019re not going to talk to him, he\u2019s likely to remove you from that as well.

At retirement age, there is so much uncertainty because neither know how long they will live, how much care they will need, and, in many cases, if their money will last as long as they do. \n\nUsually, each spouse wants to make sure the other will be cared for and that their children won't have to pay to take care of them. So if Dad dies first, while he probably wants his sons to inherit, there's no way for him to predict how much of the estate to give to his wife for her needs and what portion can be given to his sons. If he guesses wrong, then his wife won't have enough to take care of her and this son probably wouldn't help her out. So he's trusting that if he dies first, his wife will share with his sons in her will. And she will have to do the same, if she dies first.", "What does esh mean", "Some of the assests, yes.

If he chooses to give you a portion of his estate, he can. He is not obligated to do so from any legal standpoint. You've got two parents. Are you also badgering your mother about her will? Many who marry later in life, say in their 70s-80s, keep their finances separate so that each spouse's own children inherit their estate. Some don't. Most couples discuss what they want to do and leave everything to the surviving spouse, trusting that if things remain the same, the other will carry out the plans they discussed. The surviving spouse is not legally bound to do so, and I'd think would be highly unlikely to give anything to someone who treated them or their family poorly. **The point is, people can leave their possessions to anyone they want. Or to nobody.
