My dad remarried, and even though it was to the person he cheated on my mom with, and I was the best man at my dad\u2019s wedding and never cast judgement on him for what he did. \n\nSince my parents\u2019 divorce, I lived with my mom (who doesn\u2019t speak to my dad) and recently moved into my own place. But I always kept things cool with my dad. He lives about an hour away with my stepmom and her two kids. \n\nRecently, I\u2019ve become more insistent on knowing what my dad\u2019s estate plan looks like. The reason for this is I\u2019m hoping to buy a house one day and maybe go to law school. I want to understand my family\u2019s financial position before taking those risks.\n\nMy stepmom is much younger than my dad and will almost certainly outlive him. It became clear after many infuriating conversations with my dad that there was, in fact, no plan. He lied to me repeatedly about there being a plan years ago, and when he finally fessed up and went to an estate planner at my insistence, he won\u2019t send me the documents he allegedly signed.\n\nHis \u201cplan\u201d now is to ask my stepmom, who hates me, to divide her assets by 4 when she dies to be split evenly among me, my brother, and her two kids. But she can change it after my dad dies and my dad is OK with that. \n\nObviously I am not, as it means my brother and I will get nothing. I told my dad I would not spend time with him or my stepmom and stepbrothers if he intends to leave them everything. He said he actually is leaving me and my brother some money through his retirement accounts, and I was being greedy and inconsiderate of his reasons for wanting to leave the majority of his assets to his wife. He is extremely angry that I won\u2019t come to Thanksgiving and won\u2019t speak to my grandparents either who are coming to California for the first time in 20 years. \n\nIf it matters, my stepmom has no education income other than alimony from a previous marriage. She is from another country. And my stepbrothers have a dad who is independently wealthy.\n\n\nEDIT: I also told my dad if he dies penniless and leaves nobody anything that would be fine with me. But if he has money, and gives it all to her, I\u2019ll be fucking pissed. I live in CA so no matter what, the real estate pretty much guarantees that will not happen. I think it\u2019s reasonable to factor that into my own financial planning. YMMV. \n\nAlso, I paid for my own college. I\u2019ve never gotten money from my dad and don\u2019t expect to until he\u2019s dead, which I hope is a long time from now. Everyone else: my brother, my stepbrothers, his parents and brother, all take thousands if dollars from him a month. I\u2019m the only person in the family other than him who is financially independent.

Some countries and religions remove such discretion and there does seem to be upsides (as well as downsides) to that. \n\nOne upside (which seems relevant in your case) is providing some degree of certainty and clarity that helps people get on with ordinary life. It can also avoid poisoning relationships caused by people jockeying for more money. It can reduce the scope of parental manipulation of the next generation using money. \n\nWhile many people are arguing you can get on with your life pretending your father has no money to avoid getting sucked into negative dynamics, I disagree with them in suggesting that you not taking this perspective makes you the AH. \n\nFirstly, lying to yourself isn\u2019t usually healthy, as the reality is that there is money, it is being divided, and the way it is being divided is revealing about what your father really thinks about his relationship with you. Dealing with this aspect of reality is separate from dealing with the practical financial planning aspect of this reality. Both need to be dealt with. \n\nSecondly, a sense of justice is no bad thing. By taking a stand for fair treatment, you indicate both your expectations of others and what others should expect from you. If you remain silent, it would be reasonable for others to expect you to also be untrustworthy and to divide your own money unfairly when you pass away. \n\nThirdly, you are making an appropriate boundary for how to treat people whose words you cannot trust: just don\u2019t talk to them. You are not necessarily using it as any kind of revenge. He may not like it that you are not speaking to him, and you may be reacting like this because you are mad at him, not because you have a philosophical rationale. But in my reckoning, as an outsider, it is still an honorable way of protecting yourself from manipulation by someone you no longer trust. It does not put any pressure on him to change his will. Quite the opposite. It just reflects your values in a peaceful, non confrontational manner. It also seems to align reasonably well with his values that you are disposable or that his relationship with you is one where there can be no expectations on one another to communicate, regardless of how important the other party may feel such communication is. \n\nFourthly, if people think your father is NTA because your dad is free to do what he likes with his money, it would also mean you are NTA because you are equally free to associate with whoever you want to. \n\nFinally, you are coming here to try to straighten out how you feel and are opening yourself up to judgment about how to handle this situation. This suggests a desire to improve a situation you feel exasperated by. It may be you are giving a very partial account that misrepresents the real dynamics.  But taking what you say as an attempt to be honest, I would argue you are probably overwhelmed by a mixture of thoughts and feelings around betrayal, devaluation, confusion, sadness, anger, injustice, jealousy, disappointment and so on. It is unlikely communicating this in an unfiltered way with your father would be productive, especially when past communication with him has been unproductive. It seems like a better strategy to take stock, get opinions from others, deal with your complex thoughts and feelings in a safe place, work out a new way to look at things taking in the new information about what you now believe your father intends. It may be wise to get some space before you decide whether there is a new kind of relationship you can have with your father that would suit you and be more in line with what you now know you can expect from him than your past relationship.", "YTA obviously", "NTA.

Work, save money, etc.\n\nWhen your dad dies, if it\u2019s before your stepmom it goes to her. Then when she dies, it\u2019s up to her. Such is life and how it falls. It\u2019s exactly why you canNOT rely on some unknown future inheritance to live your life.\n\nThis whole thing is just gross.", "Apparently I am super lucky for being raised without a mom and dad because I don\u2019t have the luxury of feeling entitled to any kind of estate or inheritance.  Just hope I can do right by my own kids.", "YTA.", "I hope he doesnt leave you anything", "YTA\n\nYou are not entitled to any of his money.  \n\nPushing him to make arrangements just shows you to me money grubbing and will alienate you from both of them.", "You will be pissed if step mother gets money from your father? Life isn't always fair, dude. YTA", "NTA. Your Dad should have a prenuptial agreement and you should know his Estate Planning. What happens if he gets sick? Who has Power of Attorney? Medical Power?  Who pays for a nursing home? I cut contact with my mother, and my grandmother cut contact with her too.  She remarried,  no prenuptial agreement.  No Planning. The way her husband spends money, I'm not paying for a nursing home when she pissed away her sizeable inheritance.", "NTA, but it\u2019s your father\u2019s money and you can\u2019t control what he does with it. I completely understand how you feel and if it were me I wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with him either.\n\nHe\u2019s free to take that action and your free to take yours. I have boomer in-laws that are pikachu face that there\u2019s consequences to their actions, but that\u2019s how it rolls.", "ESH. Take it from someone who has done the executor thing for a parent who didn't make solid plans and had a lot of blind faith in what would happen after their death: nothing is reliable.\n\n1. You should not ever make plans that rely on inheritance, whether that's buying a home or taking on other debt. Besides the fact you'd be relying on a potentially long wait (you even hope for one!), you're relying on an invisible number. Estate plans are changeable and so are laws, taxes, all those fun things. Your dad or siblings may have health issues in the future that drain his funds dry; he could cheat, divorce again, and have to pay alimony. The estate that is there today may *not* be there tomorrow, even with good funds and planning.\n\nWhat's more, handling and closing an estate, especially if he doesn't have a will and relies on intestate law to pass his estate and assets to his current spouse, is timely, costly, and sometimes volatile. My mother's probate estate is going on a year+ and we still can't close it because of the myriad of things that need attended. I've put 10K of my own money into maintaining her assets and it's starting to look like I won't see any of that back. We've had surprise creditors, improperly registered businesses, arguments about benefactor distribution, unexpected construction fees associated with preparing the house to be sold, estate taxes that can't be submitted yet thanks to a state revenue dept issue... look, it isn't always that bad but you don't know what your parents have or haven't got in a row, okay? What looks like a healthy estate from the outside can very easily empty out just to get to the point where you *can* distribute it to heirs.\n\nDo not count on money that's not in your hands, ever. Also? Making plans for that money before your dad is gone makes you a tacky AH. It is important to include the family in your estate planning so no one is surprised, but you're coming at it from a place of self interest, it seems.\n\n2. People lose their damn minds when it comes to estates, even the tiny ones. It is crazy. Your dad is being a naive fool to think your stepmother is ever gonna prioritize you in her own estate planning. If he wants certain things to happen, he has to put the paperwork in place to guarantee them or he's as good as saying he doesn't care if those plans change. This is a conversation you do need to have with him -- that if he does intend to leave you something, then he needs to safeguard it and not leave it to someone else to enact his wishes.\n\nLastly, if he chooses not to leave you any money, that's that. You've said you are financially secure but his wife and children are not. To him, it may make more sense to provide security for the ones who need it. You can still feel hurt about that, and it's still a good idea to express your emotions in a healthy way, to communicate why this upsets you -- it sucks to feel like you aren't being supported or prioritized just because you've actually got your act together. I get it, cuz I was also that child. But for some people, they look at dividing their assets as \"who needs this the most to put everyone on an equal playing field\" instead of \"I need to give equal amounts to all no matter what\". If that's what he is doing, this isn't a division of his love... it's just money, filling in where he thinks the biggest gaps will be in his absence.\n\nTldr; you're both AHs, talk it out, and even if you do make the will, do NOT make financial decisions  based on something that's always gonna be in flux.", "Your dad may very well end up cheating on your stepmom and moving on to wife number 3, so don\u2019t count on any money.", "YTA, love your dad and stop looking at him like a fucking future piggy bank.", "I see your side. But you have to understand yoyr dad doesn't give a shit. Nta", "YTA. Your Dad is still among the living. His estate is none of your business. Period.\n\nAll anyone needs to know is that he has made a will and named an executor. The details are his to know and yours to find out after he passes.\n\nPlan your life as if you will receive nothing from anyone, ever. Then anything that you recieve - IF you receive anything with that attitude of yours - it will be a pleasant surprise. And hopefully you will have a little gratitude for it.", "YTA. You need to expect nothing from your dad's estate - esp bc he has a wife and she has children. Maybe you grieve that, I don't know. Separately, you need to decide if you want a relationship with your dad. Making inheritance a condition of the relationship is pretty AH-y.", "YTA. It's his money and he can leave it to whomever he choses. He can cash everything and set it on fire if he wants to.", "ESH.  I have no respect for a parent who lets their second marriage spouse handle the inheritance, enabling that spouse to shut out the parent\u2019s children.  Your dad and stepmom are AHs.  However, you are also the AH for hounding him. You basically told him loud and clear that he\u2019s nothing but a savings account to you. I\u2019d be hurt if I was him. If you come across as greedy as you sound then he might have written you out of the will intentionally. You should make your school and home purchase decisions as if you will get no money, like most other people on the planet. Succeed on your own and if you do end up getting money, then it\u2019s bonus.", "Yeah, the estate stuff is always a bear cat for \u201cblended\u201d families. Your dad needs to talk to a lawyer for real: he can establish a trust to take care of your stepmom, with the remainder to be split among surviving offspring when she dies. No reason it can\u2019t be split between you and your brother, and the remaining third divided up between her kids.\nYou\u2019ll be happier if you think of it as money that will supplement your retirement rather than putting off going to law school or buying a house. You can find the way to afford both those things and not be a \u201cwaiter\u201d for your dad to pass away.\nKeep in mind that in the US, you are not entitled to an inheritance. Different elsewhere, but not here. Dad\u2019s money, as long as he is mentally competent, is his to spend. And if your step mom married him when she had little $$$ of her own, he might think it only generous snd right that her kids get part of his $$$ when he passes. After all, he presumably took care of you and your sib and your schooling and so on, and they may not have had nearly the same. You don\u2019t  have to like it; that\u2019s how it is. He doesn\u2019t have to show you anything, although it would be ideal if everybody knew what the arrangements were. But he needs a will. He needs some good estate planning  advice from an attorney. \nApologize to him, go to jaw school, but your own house, and if you get an inheritance, be glad and grateful. It\u2019s a lot more than a lot of people will ever get.", "YTA. What he does with his money, including giving it away to charity or spending it on ladies of the night, has nothing to do with you.

Your dad has the right to do what he wants. You have the right to do what you want and remove him from your life.", "Hope u realize \"his estate\" will most likely go the surviving spouse.\nHowever,Having a similar situation with siblings getting all they want and myself getting nothing I understand you feeling entitled to know, but if he hasn't divulged it to you it's most likely unfair and your better off depending on yourself", "YTA. You proudly claim to be independent financially yet you\u2019re holding your relationship with him hostage over being entitled to his money \u201cwhen he\u2019s dead\u201d.

You just don't like the answer. Further, you make the point that you're OK without receiving any money as long as no one else does. Sounds like you are already doing the planning to finance your house and education in the event he dies sooner than later and that there would be a payoff worth throwing your relationship away for. The awful thing is that the longer he lives, the longer you will avoid him, AND the less you'll receive. What's the winning scenario? That he die soon?\n\nEnjoy your financial independence.

If he doesn't there's not much you can do about it.", "NTA. I completely understand. It's not about the money. It's what the money represents. The money is a show of love. Maybe you feel that him not considering you in the inheritance represents him not loving you. Maybe you feel like you're coming in second best behind your step mom. That makes total sense. Sometimes people just don't understand how complicated feelings get around inheritance issues. I think your Dad doesn't understand that.  If your feelings are hurt (and that makes you pissed off at him), could you try and explain this to your father? He may never understand. It's such a delicate situation.  But I think you are correct. His estate plan is pathetic. And it doesn't consider your feelings.", "ESH. You because your dad owes you nothing after he dies. He could spend all his cash or get buried with it because it's his money. You need to make your own life plans independent of whether you get an inheritance from it or not. Your dad sucks for lying all these years about having an estate plan when he did not. He also sucks for actually thinking once he's gone his wife will leave you and your sibling an equal share of what's left of his estate to the 2 of you. Once he's gone she can do whatever she wants with the estate because it'll be legally all hers. Inform your dad there are too many stories on reddit of a step-parent cutting off the older kids after their parents death or spending all the cash before they could collect and it's all been legal.", "NTA - you can be angry but you also can\u2019t decide what he ultimately does what he wants with his money. What you do get to decide is how you want to treat your relationship with him, just like how he has decided to give your stepmother his assets.", "Uhhh so you hope that your dad doesn\u2019t die for a long time but you plan to treat him as if he was dead by not spending time with him because he doesn\u2019t plan to leave you his estate. That makes a lot of sense. You aren\u2019t entitled to his money and things change (eg maybe he will need really expense dementia care that will use up his entire estate and the wife will inherit only funeral bills). You should never factor expected inheritance into your financial planning. If you get one, great. Otherwise plan as if you won\u2019t get one. \n\nTo demand an inheritance at all makes YTA", "Here's a suggestion:  Just let it go.\n\nYou don't deserve anything, you're not entitled to anything.  Statistically, this isn't a question that's going to need an answer for at least 30-40 more years.  So why are you getting all bent out of shape about it?  Just assume you're getting nothing, and move on with your life.  Don't worry about anyone else.  Just worry about yourself.  Don't make your own long term financial decisions based on the financial result of someone else's death.  Save yourself the ulcer.\n\nBesides, even if he agreed to leave you percentage of the estate, there's a decent chance that between retirement, late-life medical expenses, and possibly another divorce or two, he will burn through everything he has before he dies.  The last thing you want to do is be pushing retirement age yourself, dependent on some lump sum that fails to materialize.", "YTA.

It seems he\u2019s helping everyone else while you are financially independent. Maybe it makes sense for him to share now- maybe calculate everything he\u2019s been sharing with everyone else, and share with you now, while he\u2019s alive. Take that money and invest it in what you think is best (house, school, etc) and then not count on anything once he\u2019s passed. Is unfortunate that he\u2019s making these decisions, but ultimately he\u2019s showing you who he is. I feel like you have a few options here- 1. Continue the path you\u2019re on, which will likely blow up the relationship which will result in low to no relationship and nothing while he\u2019s alive or dead. 2. Accept his shitty choices and go low contact and deal with your resentment (completely valid, btw). 3. Communicate and ask for him to be generous with you while he\u2019s alive and share with you equally, if not more, knowing you\u2019ll get nothing when he\u2019s dead. Possibly salvage relationship 4. Forgive and move on knowing he\u2019s selfish and that you will get nothing while he\u2019s alive or dead and plan accordingly. There\u2019s probably other options as well, but unfortunately it seems you both have come to an impasse. It kind of looks like more communication or little to no contact are the next paths. So, I would ask yourself what your priorities are- you cannot change him, but you can choose your path forward. Is your priority relationships (with someone who has shown many times where you are in his priority), or financial security (either through inheritance or through self making and sacrificing time in other areas of your life). Either choice is fine- it really boils down to what\u2019s important to you. He\u2019s shown you who he is and where you are not a priority for him, now you get to decide how he fits in your life. I know for our financial well-being for our family, we\u2019ve had to sacrifice time with family to be financially secure- if we knew family valued and prioritized us (alive and dead), we would also put them at a high priority. If they don\u2019t, we don\u2019t as our nuclear family and inheritance for our children is more important.

You going to yell at him in his coffin about the economy???? \n\n\nIf you\u2019re so \u201cbootstraps\u201d about life compared to your brother and step-sibs then pull them bootstraps up, take many other well written redditors\u2019 advice, and plan for NOTHING and be a grateful human being. \n\nSome of us will see NOTHING from anyone without re-marrying. Some of us are subtly but not blatantly disowned for being gay. Some of us are disowned for getting pregnant too early because we weren\u2019t given proper sex ed. Some of us grew up in foster care or orphaned. Some of us got accepted to law or medical programs and had to give that up because of x, y, and z.

Your father might retire and live in an expensive retirement home. Or worse, your father might need long-term medical care that will drain everything he owns.\n\nIt is a good son who wants his parents to have estate plans to make sure their wishes are written down and followed.

You are entitled to absolutely nothing and should view anything you do get with gratitude. \n\nYou are wildly out of line to harass him and insist on knowing his private financial information and plans. It makes sense that his wife would get most, if not all, of his estate. You are not an underaged minor child who is dependent on him for your support. Anything he leaves you is simply a gift. Besides, he might surprise you and live to be 100, so you'd be waiting a very long time to collect.\n\nYTA, and you owe him an apology. Trying to profit from someone's death is gross.

What your parents have and what they choose to share with you (and how) is entirely up to them. They don\u2019t owe you a thing past keeping you healthy and safe until such time that you are able to do the same for yourself.\n\nFor context, my parents are rather well off. They have a primary home, a vacation home, several rental properties, along with investments and retirement accounts. My mom hasn\u2019t worked in 30 years, and my dad has been fully remote. They have helped me greatly in their own ways at their own time, and on respectful terms. \n\nI recently got married and we had put an offer in on a house (that my wife and I could afford on our own). However, just before approval I got laid off. I called my dad, explained the situation and asked what advice and options he could provide as I didn\u2019t want to proceed and promise my wife anything that I (personally) couldn\u2019t deliver on. My parents jumped at the opportunity to help and held the mortgage for us. I insisted that ai pay them interest, but they gave us a rate much lower than the market rate.\n\nThe key difference here is the approach. If you present yourself as telling them what they should do instead of asking them to assist in your risk management, you come off as a disrespectful brat instead of an appreciative kid (you\u2019re always their kid regardless of age). If your dad wants to leave it to his wife, or up to his wife that is his call. If he offers you assurances to help and legally documents those assurances that is a different story. \n\nHow you pose the question matters both in their willingness to assist and how they will back up promises made. Deciding that you aren\u2019t going to speak to someone because they won\u2019t pay you out down the road is emotional manipulation and extortion.

I could get it if you were his step son, that his only obligation is his bio kids, but you're all his bio kids. Ngl though, what did you expect from him when he has already shown that his desires/wants come before his family, he could have chose to leave your mom rather than cheat bc the divorce/separation happened anyways. \n\nBut you also sound callous and calculating of money too. Another user made a going point about you making plans about your inheritance from your dad which is strange and likely wouldn't work unless you're not going to law school for 10+ years from now and/or if you're waiting to do it then for the long con. NTA? ESH a bit?", "Otherwise I would agree with the two of you, but OP is literally planning his life decision based on his father's death. \n\nWho the fuck calls their dad asking :\" he yo, what's yo real estate plan like?

My mom disinherited me. Money was her love language, so did it hurt? Yes, but I still helped her in her dying days because in the end, *it's her money*.\n\nOP's actions are showing his priorities. Money is his priority.", "Honestly, OP 's dad wants to enjoy the perks of having a son without having to give anything back in return.\n\nLike having a son to attend his wedding. A son to keep him company during Thanksgiving. A grandson for his parents to be proud of. A son to call him dad and care for him. \n\nBut god forbid his son expects fairness from him. Then it is entitlement. It is his money.\n\nWell, then he can demands his Dad privileges from his step-children.", "This completely ignores any inheritance from the mother. It also ignores any arrangement made in the divorce.

My dad wants my sis and I to have some insurance payouts, but his wife hates us and will just get it all with no thoughts to us. It\u2019s not that we want money, we want what HE WANTS us to get. Pretty sure we\u2019ll get $0.00", "He\u2019s never gotten money from his Dad, paid for his own college, and is fine if his Dad spends all his assets before he dies.

You don\u2019t judge him for leaving your mom and marrying his affair partner, but you want to get paid. That\u2019s a bad place to be in. Your inheritance went away when your dad remarried, so accept it the way you accept that your dad left your mom. It\u2019s the same act, it\u2019s just that the money impacts you.", "Because your question is regarding to being upset with his estate planning.  \n\nAs much as you don\u2019t want to hear it - what your dad does with HIS estate is HIS choice.

Did she have a therapist?", "> I was living in another state working 80 hours a week\n\nBS, you weren't working 80 hours a week, period. You are purposely exaggerating this, and the rest of the story, to make you appear to not be a giant gold-digger and an AH.", "That doesn't change anything. If money is more important than your relationship with your dad then so be it. But it makes YTA - it is his money to do with as he sees fit. He can leave it to an animal charity and still not be an AH. Far better to have a relationship with a parent when they are alive then money from a dead man. \n\nAs to this nonsense about needing to know this to make decisions about property or education - good grief, making decisions on the basis of an inheritance of unknown size that may not come to you for 20-30 years is ridiculous. In that time you should have more than reaped the benefits of your employment, and paid off a mortgage if you have bought within your means.", "I get that, and I'm not necessarily on OP's side, but that statement always hits me strangely. It's not a choice. In most cases, we would obviously prefer to keep our loved ones, but it's not a trade. My best friend and I both lost parents. We both wish they were still here. She got a home and quite a bit of money, I did not. Her getting that inheritance doesn't mean she misses her parent less than I miss mine, but it does mean she could take time off to grieve. It means she has a home and stability for her family (which her mom would have wanted). Appreciating, or even needing, your inheritance doesn't negate your grief. If she could trade the money for her mom, she would, but that's not reality.", "Right.  If his Dad lives into his 90s, OP will likely be in (or close to) his 70s.  How the fuck is an inheritance going to make a meaningful difference in his life at that point?", "he says that but wont talk to him unless he gets money. dads better off without him around", "He planning to leave him money via retirement accounts.  This guy sounds resentful and is requiring his dad to use money to purchase time with him.", "Her only income is alimony pretty much says it all.", ">The reason for this is ***I\u2019m hoping to buy a house one day and maybe go to law school.***\n\nThat's no being financially independent if you're expecting money from someone else to get something for yourself.\n\nWho is everyone else? Dad's wife? She is the man's wife and is very much entitled to at least half and the only other family member with a blood connection to dad is OP's brother and OP has made any mention on how they're dependent on dad if he is.", "Honestly I deserve that. I so regret doing that and fortunately my mom forgave me.", "He was doing it for the money!", "I doubt he cares. Besides, he was never really someone I felt I could depend on. He's helped out occasionally, like when he and my stepmom watched my daughter while I gave birth, because my grandparents were too old to be solely responsible for a special needs toddler. I viewed his mom and dad more like my parents. \n\nI can't take petty revenge, for all his faults as a father, he was a damn good son and looked after my beloved grandparents very well. When a bad hurricane came through and knocked out the power and I saw how hard it was for my grandpa to get their tiny little generator to go, one that barely powered my grandma's machines (oxygen machine, c-pap, and nebulizer), I bought one soon after that could power their whole house minus the dryer and hot water heater, and my dad wired it up directly to the breaker box and bought an electric starter to go with it so my grandpa could simply turn off the power input to the house from the city from the breaker box and press a button to turn on the generator. \n\nWhen my grandparents' central heat and air went out, I bought them a huge window unit that could cool their entire home, and my dad installed not only the extremely heavy unit and made sure it was beyond secure, he installed the special plug-in it needed run all the way under the house to the breaker box. \n\nWhen the transmission went out on my grandpa's car, my dad and I both gave him money to get it fixed. My dad helped him find a shop and transported it. \n\nMy grandparents had 6 kids, one died in infancy, one married and moved a few hours away and saw them once or twice a month, one lived 30 minutes away and saw them sporadically, one worked right across the street and saw them never, one is a garbage human I'm ashamed to share DNA with and doesn't deserve to be mentioned, and my dad lived right down the street and saw them multiple times a week. I lived with them until I was 20, then moved across town and saw them at least twice a week for long visits until I developed agoraphobia, but still chatted with them often and came for those long visits (like 8 hours at a time) on my less anxious days, usually with dinner. \n\nMy dad cared for them more than any of us, I couldn't even tell you how much, because he doesn't mention that kind of thing, the only reason I know about the things I do is because I was directly involved in them. I do know that when they died, he handled everything to do with the life insurance and estate. And I know he did it fairly and while dealing with some very dramatic, trashy individuals. \n\nSo, I can't take revenge. I love my children the most, but my grandparents right after. I can't truly resent him because he was good to them.", "Sometimes there's just no sense in beating around the bush.", "Some people are just less eloquent with words .\n\nI feel that OP perhaps have trouble understanding his own feelings.\nLike dad is helping everyone else financially, OP is the only one getting nothing and struggling.", "nah your actions show you're a doormat for someone who purposely hurt you...her own child", "Yep it\u2019s sad and ridiculous.\n\nImo people have got this wrong, the kid should get the money regardless of which parent he is from and normally would but with a second wife/ husband in play they always divert it to their kids with zero fucks given..", "Yes zero fucking dollars.  From time immemorial - it's in a Heironymous Bosch painting.\n\nI want to have MY house assets get divided between my husband and our three kids if I die first because I don't want some bimbo taking money from my kids but dems da breaks, my husband doesn't want the kids owning his house.\n\nSUCKS!!!", "Why not take out a life insurance policy on your father? Morbid as it might seem you can take out life insurance policies on anyone you want (and statistically, if you work a white collar job then your employer probably has a policy with your name on it).", "He isn't entitled to a share. \n\nHe literally wrote he is refusing to see his grandparents until his dad puts him in the will. His edit is him trying to lessen how awful his actions are.", "Maybe, if there's enough money. And it's of benefit to do that. Depends on the state. And how it's set up.", "Ok so why is he not the AH? You didn\u2019t answer my question.", "Yes and yes.", "Ok irdc if you believe me but yeah I was. I dropped out of school to work on a political campaign and I froze my flipping tail off canvassing in a place that towards the end was colder than a witch\u2019s tit. Why does it even matter where I was or how much I worked? \n\nThe point is I made career decisions my parents didn\u2019t support, and I felt badly about it, and I was unwilling to lecture them about their choices at the time.

Their actions will be judged in the afterlife.", "It doesn't cost a lot to set up a trust. You set it up when you get the will done. Plus it sounds like, at least at this time, there is enough money. \n\nThe trust can be set up to pay housing & medical expenses for the wife and the balance, if any, be distributed to the kids after her death.\n\nUltimately, it is the father's choice, but IF the father is worried about making sure the ex was covered but also wanted his kids get something after she died, it would be the only way to do it. If dad doesn't care to bother to protect his kids, then OP has a right to feel the way he wants to feel about it.", "It's because of what you called your stepmom. \n\nAnd I'd argue you're the one who is acting more like a gold digger right now.", "Of course he\u2019s an asshole, but not for refusing to commit to a distribution of his assets after his death. What he does with his money isn\u2019t any of your business. It\u2019s just some cognitive dissonance.

Why do you need to help her?

I've not heard of trusts being used except in cases of extreme wealth. Good to know they are an option.", "That speaks to your entitlement. He is NOT obligated to leave you anything.
