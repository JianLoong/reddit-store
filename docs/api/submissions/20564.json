You\u2019re showing that difference is positive. I feel bad for kids that are shoved into scratchy dresses or sweaters, tight hair bows etc all for aesthetic.", "At Disney there used to be an entire store that sold mis-matched socks.

Your SO needs to calm tf down and live a little lol\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSo long as it is weather appropriate, clean, and situation appropriate who cares? I could understand if they were choosing to wear sweaters in summer or a bathing suit to a restaurant, but for fucks sake, your child is 3 and it's just mismatched socks, \n\nI'm curious if you SO does the same thing to you?", "Rule #1 in parenting a 3YO (or any toddler). Pick your battles. Even if they were going to daycare or nursery school, you're right, this is self expression. My oldest started dressing herself at 2 and change. She was an adamently autonomous person (even today all grown) even at that young age. Perhaps they like being silly. Perhaps they like both socks to much and could not choose. Win-win-win! They now have another pair in the drawer!\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nThere\u2019s a time & place to dictate what your child wears once they are old enough to pick things out themself \n\nOur toddler just turned 2 & is starting to pick her own clothes. Some of the outfits she picks are so silly looking but she loves it! \n\nMismatched socks is such a minor thing for your SO to get upset over. Who cares if it\u2019s silly? Your toddler is THREE! They\u2019re supposed to be silly!", "My kids wear mismatched socks all the time. Your partner would blow a fuse.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Toddlers are supposed to be silly! It is totally appropriate and developmentally healthy to allow your child to make decisions like this. I would understand wanting them to look put together if it was a special event of some kind, but mismatched socks on a regular day is totally fine.\n\nDepending on where you live, I can imagine your SO might be worried that other parents will look down on them for sending their child to school in mismatched clothing. So I would be empathetic on that point, while standing firm that it\u2019s not worth limiting your child\u2019s self expression over.", "NTA. My kids wear what they want. They\u2019re kids. The rule is it has to be weather appropriate and you have to wear pants when there is company or we are going into public. Otherwise, have at it.", "Silly is great, especially if you are three years old! At that age, being silly, curious and expressive is literally like. Your whole purpose. Definitely NTA.", "NTA- your SO lectures a 3 year old about being silly... what a waste of time and effort for them to complain about that. \n\n- functional adult who wears mismatched socks sometimes", "NTA.  My mom let me wear a whole clown costume to my preschool picnic.  Wasn't til we were sorting through old pics in my 20s that I was like... wait why am I the only one in a costume?  She goes, \"you wanted to wear it, I chose to pick my battles\".  I have not been stunted or shunned because of what I wore as a child.  Tell your SO to grow up and let your kid be a kid.  Its great that they're already dressing themselves at 3 years old!", "Toddlers have absolutely zero control over anything in their lives. Somebody else decides when they go to bed, when they get up, where they go, what they eat, what they do. Three years old is a good age to start letting them make decisions that don't have any life-shaking consequences, like socks. You might want to explain to them that sometimes when they do special things they have to wear special clothes, but on the daily? it's probably a good place to start handing over some of the parental decision-making power. And maybe - just maybe - that's where your SO is feeling a little uncomfy - it's hard to start letting go of being 100% in charge, and start accepting that your small person is growing and changing and forming their own opinions. You start letting them wear mis-matched socks, next thing you know they're driving a fast car and dating and moving out and now you're facing your own mortality. Parenting means sometimes you have to sit with your own big mixed-up feels for a while and figure out where they're coming from.", "I have two kids under 10, and they both still choose their own clothes and dress themselves. They often wear absolutely cringeworthy outfits, but hey, if that\u2019s their style, who cares?? As long as kids are dressed appropriately for the weather, (ex: no shorts/sandals in the snow) I fail to see a problem.", "My 20 somethings are still wearing mismatched socks. It\u2019s been years now. \nIt\u2019s really not all that important is it? \n\nMe, I don\u2019t do it, but it\u2019s not my feet and not my socks. \n\nYour so is making problems when there are none. Why?", "As long as it doesn't look like neglect, I'm all for children being independent and creative!", "NTA, as long as it covers everything that needs to be covered and is weather/dresscode appropriate, I have always let my daughter dress herself.

Is gonna be a controlling jerk , you can already tell", "NTA\n\nA child is meant to be silly. The world would be a much better place if self-expression and creativity were celebrated instead of stifled. \n\nTalk about a completely over the top controlling action by your wife! Gracious. \n\nPlease help her see how she\u2019s being unnecessarily controlling when she should be helping your child express themselves and have autonomy over as many innocuous decisions as possible to foster self esteem and confidence.", "I personally can't stand wearing two different socks. But like, if my 3yo was happily dressing themselves then absolutely let them do whatever they'd like. Let them be silly! NTA.", "Your toddler is expressing themselves. They are a toddler. Your SO is being ridiculous and should behave like an adult i.e. being proud of the toddler for dressing themselves not berating them for wearing odd socks. Seriously most people won\u2019t even notice.", "NTA there is nothing wrong with letting a child express themselves with clothing. I often wear mismatched socks because I do not have time for all that.", "NTA. That\u2019s great the kid dresses themselves and great they are creative.", "In what order does your toddler dress? \n\none sock, the other sock, one shoe, the other shoe \n\none sock, matching shoe, the other sock, the other shoe\n\nNAH, you are pleased that your kid can dress themselves. Your wife wants a more fashioned approach to dressing, plus teaching/emphasizing the concepts of \"same\" and \"different\" that are needed to select matching socks. (I'd be curious if the kid is aware that the socks they choose are different or if they mentally organize socks into \"paired\" \"mismatched\")", "The reverse is also true though. There's nothing wrong with telling a kid they have to be dressed appropriately with matching socks. Children don't begin behaving according expectation by osmosis, you have to enforce it. If it actually doesn't matter, like you're claiming, then you should have no problem just letting him parent how he sees fit. You just are prioritizing not dealing with the upset over teaching the kid proper behavior.", "NAH\n\nI did exactly what you did with my kids.  Let them dress themselves and have fun, start making choices and be the \"big person\" making big person decisions.\n\nBUT, there is a difference in them doing this for a trip to the store, outside to play or just around the house.  Remember, you are training the child to make decent decisions, unless you go to work looking like a 3 yo you are setting them up for emotional letdowns.\n\nI get it, they are 3 and are cute as can be doing cute stuff but you have to let them know there are also social boundaries and help them see them as well.  School, social events like a christening or wedding or even a long trip on a plane or train is not where they \"do their own thing\".  \n\nIts all fun and games until they come home from school crying because all the kids are making fun of them for having a goofy outfit.  Then what?  You are going to rationalize with a toddler the explanation of self expression or will it take a situation like that to make you realize you set your child up for failure?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is a 'what will people think' type of argument that has multiple sides as well.  It's also 'how will the child fit in with peers\" argument as well.   Why not just meet in the middle and teach the kid that it's okay to be silly sometimes and sometimes you need to make an impression (the whole dress for success nonsense).

Mismatched socks is what my girls liked doing too.", "My boys were famous for grabbing two random socks and wearing them. All I asked of them was to make them the same LENGTH of sock. It drove me bonkers for them to wear a crew sock with an ankle sock. Other than that, they were free to do as they pleased. \n\nWhen my daughter was 3, she had some WILD outfits. And I let her.

They want to dress for themselves to go to the store and wear a spiderman outfit, no problem.  They want to attend a wedding with me wearing that same spiderman outfit, now thats a problem.  \n\nAgain, what I have said is there is not a problem with the child doing this, just not for school or certain other events.", "Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\n\nI\u2019m glad you see the value in allowing children to make their own choices, because this is what the real world is like.  If the only thing stopping a person from wearing mismatch socks is their parent; then, the second they are out of the house, they are going to go back to wearing mismatch socks. \n\nBut if they are allowed to have bodily autonomy, they will have the opportunity to decide whether or not they want to continue wearing mismatch socks, depending on how strongly they are attached to that form of the expression, as well as how they treated by their peers (as they get older and more conscious of fashion choices).\n\nAgain, I\u2019m so glad that we are on the same page!\ud83d\udc4d", "Life is too short to worry about matching socks lol", "I'm glad you read everything I wrote, as you have in past exchanges between us.  \n\nI'm glad you saw that I said there is nothing wrong with them choosing what they want to wear regardless of it matching within social bounds or events.\n\nI do my best to give my children the opportunity to make their choices, how else are they going to learn.  BUT, its my job as their parent to guide them in the direction of good choices.  \n\nIts OBVIOUS you do NOT have children as ONE of the biggest deals with being a parent is trying to keep your child happy and care free.  This would include keeping them from being made fun of at school or something along those lines.  And you most certainly DO NOT let them go anywhere with an obvious possibility of them coming home crying because you thought it looked cute.\n\nAs a parent children are allowed a certain autonomy, within reason.  They dont decide what they are eating every day, they dont decide if they should bathe or not, they dont decide if they want to brush their teeth every day.\n\nIf/when you ever have children this will become natural to you.", "I\u2019m glad you are OK with making speculative assumptions as well as being condescending, just because someone doesn\u2019t agree with your particular parenting style.  \n\nI agree that it\u2019s your job to GUIDE your children to make goos choices. But \u201cguide\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cmandate.\u201d\n\nPersonally, I would advise my children of what current fashion trends are, as well as possible consequences (from their peers) for bucking those trends After that, I\u2019m going to allow the child to make his or her choice.  Personally, I believe that experience is the best teacher.\n\nWhat\u2019s ironic, is the fact that mismatch socks are pretty trendy right now.  \n\nYeah, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the best person to be giving parenting advice when you can\u2019t even communicate with a stranger without becoming hostile."]}
