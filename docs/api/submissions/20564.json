Somebody else decides when they go to bed, when they get up, where they go, what they eat, what they do. Three years old is a good age to start letting them make decisions that don't have any life-shaking consequences, like socks. You might want to explain to them that sometimes when they do special things they have to wear special clothes, but on the daily? it's probably a good place to start handing over some of the parental decision-making power. And maybe - just maybe - that's where your SO is feeling a little uncomfy - it's hard to start letting go of being 100% in charge, and start accepting that your small person is growing and changing and forming their own opinions. You start letting them wear mis-matched socks, next thing you know they're driving a fast car and dating and moving out and now you're facing your own mortality.

But like, if my 3yo was happily dressing themselves then absolutely let them do whatever they'd like. Let them be silly! NTA.", "Your toddler is expressing themselves. They are a toddler. Your SO is being ridiculous and should behave like an adult i.e. being proud of the toddler for dressing themselves not berating them for wearing odd socks.

Your wife wants a more fashioned approach to dressing, plus teaching/emphasizing the concepts of \"same\" and \"different\" that are needed to select matching socks. (I'd be curious if the kid is aware that the socks they choose are different or if they mentally organize socks into \"paired\" \"mismatched\")", "The reverse is also true though. There's nothing wrong with telling a kid they have to be dressed appropriately with matching socks. Children don't begin behaving according expectation by osmosis, you have to enforce it. If it actually doesn't matter, like you're claiming, then you should have no problem just letting him parent how he sees fit. You just are prioritizing not dealing with the upset over teaching the kid proper behavior.", "NAH\n\nI did exactly what you did with my kids.  Let them dress themselves and have fun, start making choices and be the \"big person\" making big person decisions.\n\nBUT, there is a difference in them doing this for a trip to the store, outside to play or just around the house.  Remember, you are training the child to make decent decisions, unless you go to work looking like a 3 yo you are setting them up for emotional letdowns.\n\nI get it, they are 3 and are cute as can be doing cute stuff but you have to let them know there are also social boundaries and help them see them as well.  School, social events like a christening or wedding or even a long trip on a plane or train is not where they \"do their own thing\".  \n\nIts all fun and games until they come home from school crying because all the kids are making fun of them for having a goofy outfit.
