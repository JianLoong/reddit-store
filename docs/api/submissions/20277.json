I know it's somewhat childish, but birthdays mean a lot to me. Always has, and my husband known this. We have been together for 16 years, of which almost 4 years married.\n\nI have a lot of mental health issues (autism, depression, adhd, anxiety, etc). We also had a rough year with a couple of deaths in the family. I was really looking forward to have a day where I got to feel celebrated - I kind of needed it even more today than recent years.\n\nMy husband got home from work and we had to pick up our 3yo from school and have an evaluation for him. Because it was pretty late after, I decided that we could just eat mcdonalds for my birthday. It's easy, we all like it, and our son was very excited.\n\nWhen we got home, my husband hadn't ordered anything for himself (I was busy with my son during the order so hadn't noticed), and he was planning on cooking for himself when our boy was in bed.\n\nThis upset me. For years we have a tradition that the birthdayperson decides what we eat, and we eat as a family. Instead, he didn't even want to sit near us until I told him to at least eat a few bites and sit down with us - he was sitting on the other side of the room until then.\n\nIt also upset me, because our free time is limited and he chose to spend the evening rather in the kitchen instead of with me on my birthday.\n\nI also didn't get any card, and he hadn't even made something with my kid that he could give me. While fathersday was last Sunday and we got him a cute card, a few gifts and some special project me and my son had made on together.\n\nHe then told me to go upstairs (I was teary eyed) because our boy said he wanted to make me something. He always gives something on birthdays so it must have confused him too.\n\nHe made me something beautiful, but the damage of my husband was already done. I shouldn't have to ask for things on my birthday. I literally got nothing if I hadn't asked.\n\nSo when our child went to bed, I got angry. And I cried. Then he got angry, said it was a workday and he just didn't want to spend his few hours before bed with me because then he shouldn't have any free time then. I said 1 hour would have been fine, but I shouldn't have to ask.\n\nWe argued and he said I would have gotten a gift tomorrow, but as I am ungrateful I can  just send it back when it arrives. \n\nHis other reasons were that he just didn't think about it, his effort was ordering a gift a week ago and it should be enough, he didn't want to eat mcdonalds, and I shouldn't be mad.\n\nIn the end he didn't cook dinner for himself and just sat in his room playing games all evening while I cried downstairs. Me being angry didn't made him want to be near me.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1687383173, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fk48t/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_husband_m34_for_doing/", "score": 486, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If/when I have planned a gift for someone, and it's going to be a day late, I don't withhold knowledge of that gift to avoid \"ruining the surprise\" or whatever OP's husband will claim to be doing. I wish the person a happy birthday, I do my best to make their day special in other ways, and I promise that we can celebrate \"properly\" very soon. That is not what was going on here. I highly doubt that OP's husband had ordered her a gift at all; it's just a cover for the fact that he needs to run out and get her something tomorrow. Another possibility is that if husband is feeling totally burned out and just can't get in the birthday spirit on the day, he could just ask for the postponement in advance. But he would still need to do so nicely, not grump about as he does in OP's retelling. We all have times when we're just not in a party mood, but we need to communicate that like grown-ups and not act resentful because a loved one has dared to have a birthday at an inconvenient moment for us.", "I also HAD one.", "I had to cut some parts as my post was too long to be accepted, but as I get this comment a lot I'd like to specify. \n\nMy husband does most of the cooking in our household. Usually, after a busy day he suggests takeout instead of cooking. We were in the car when I suggested mcdonalds, partly so we didn't have to cook and could just relax the rest of the evening.\n\nHe could have mentioned he didn't want to eat mcdonalds, but he didn't. He agreed with eating mcdonalds and we went to get it.\n\nI'm not upset at the fact he didn't want to eat mcdonalds, I'm upset that he didn't mention it and just planned the little time we could spend together in the evening when LO is in bed watching a movie orso, to spend it cooking for himself (we have a small and currently very hot kitchen which is not suited to fit 2 people for happy chitchat while cooking) and then eating it upstairs behind his computer (which he does more often). And I was upset that he just sat behind a desk on his phone on the other side of the room, while me and LO were seated with our mcdonalds on the couch by ourselves.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The gall.", "NAH, from what you've said, it sounds like he's burned out and struggling a lot. \n\nBut also I completely understand why you'd expect to be treated on your birthday and why you felt disappointed. \n\nEmotions are what they are and they can be hard to control. Discuss this together and let both people say what needs to be said, communication is key in every relationship. Be mindful of what you say in the moment. Take a minute to respond if you need to. And going forward, if you have an expectation or wish for an event, communicate in advance and plan together.", "NTA but it doesn\u2019t look like he loves you\u2026", "Bless your heart, I can feel how much this hurt you and I\u2019ll say NTA but I\u2019ll also say there is a LOT more going on than this one time and I very much encourage you to get some counseling and work through these issues as a couple.", "NTA. I doubt you have a gift coming otherwise a \u201cit\u2019s on the way love!\u201d Would have been said. \n\n\nI can see not celebrating on a work day but then generally that should be communicated.", "There\u2019s definitely more to this than is being let on", "Never met a woman who didn\u2019t think that her birthday was the most important day in the history of the universe. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.\n\nYou're husband doesn't care about you.

Believe him and establish consequences.", "bro all she wanted was to eat mcdonalds with her husband. like in what world is that too big of an ask.", "I like this comment", "She\u2019s an asshole because he absolutely disregarded her on her birthday? What? If he was having issues he can communicate with her like an adult. It\u2019s not the job of the person who\u2019s been let down to have to put the work in to see why her partner has done this. In fact this sort of explaining away bad behaviour is actually why people stay in abusive relationships - he didn\u2019t mean it he\u2019s just stressed. Asking her to investigate what\u2019s going on with him is fine but actively blaming her to the point of saying he\u2019s not at fault while she is for his behaviour is messed up.", "NTA. Everything else aside, refusing to eat dinner with the family is always rude if you don't actually have something you need to be doing.", "So whats the full story? It sounds like this is the first time,", "But how otherwise he would have time to game for 5 hours, that's more important than spending time with your wife on her birthday /s", "Me three.\n\nImagine buying a guy a $250 watch for Valentine's day and he gives you a mug that looks like he got from the local shop because \"I know you like tea.\" \n\nI have a purple mug for tea. I have 3. All people. Purple is my favorite color -- I've got purple nails, clothes, etc etc. and this is a blue mug. Not even dark blue, it's baby fucking blue. \n\nI just took the watch back to Macy's. Covid hit and my relationship sank hard", "Same here.  I had a big milestone birthday, and while I didn't like big celebrations, was hoping for something special (keepsake sort of thing) as a gift. Then-husband gave me an oven mitt/apron set. Still in the bag it came in.   \n\n\nYeah. Now he's the ex-husband.", "McDonalds is disgusting, he went with her, he is not required to eat that junk.", "It's normal to be upset about what happened. I would be, too, and I bet a lot of other people, from all walks of life, would feel at least a bit disappointed. Your feelings are ok.", "He\u2019s actively gaslighting you and minimizing your feelings. That\u2019s emotional abuse.", "Your husband is gaslighting you and it seems to be a long term habit. I don't think only you need help, I think you need to explore this as a couple. I really do not like the sounds of anything your husband said or did in the post and I'm liking it even less from your replies. \n\nYou are valid. Your feelings are valid and I hope that the responses you got here gave you a little more confidence in knowing that your requests were entirely reasonable. Do not allow yourself to be manipulated anymore.", "he sounds like a gaslighting manipulator", "It\u2019s common sense that if your partner exhibits behaviour that is out of the ordinary, then you would look deeper than surface level. She also could have expressed her disappointment in a healthy way instead of crying, getting angry and demanding. I understand she was upset, but she did not appropriately handle one year he forgot out of sixteen years of marriage. If this is the straw that broke them, their foundation was not as strong as either of them think.", "I mean she could also be having a rough patch seeing as how she got upset that he didn't want to eat McDonalds (which I really don't blame him haha). That just seems super odd to get upset over. Hence why I said they both suck here.", "The bar is on the floor and yet he still manages to be under it.

And your partner should support you through it, if you make effort to make yourself work. You deserve a relationship that is loving and supportive. \nI have similar issues plus endometriosis and other fun health issues on top, and I get where people come from saying that it\u2019s a lot and may cause your partner to feel overwhelmed and yada yada whatever excuse people try to find for being an asshole. I get it. But you found the strength to seek the diagnosis, you seem to be pretty well put together (work and kid??? \ud83d\ude05I barely manage myself xD), so trying to blame you for what you are is just stupid and missing the point. Don\u2019t let anyone pressure you to believe that it\u2019s other way. \nNTA obviously. I\u2019d send you a birthday card \ud83d\udc96"]}
