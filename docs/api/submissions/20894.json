They do not like it when the car is out of your possession, and if the fix is done before the days are up then they will expect it back pronto. I can easily see how the idea of leaving the loaner at the airport stresses her out. It is not the solution you think it is.\n\nI suppose she also sucks for asking you to agree before knowing the details\u2026but honestly she does not suck for expressing her expectations to you. \n\nPerhaps you ARE being selfish by using your kids as a shield.

So own that. You don\u2019t want to have to help her out. \n\nPrioritizing your own wants sometimes is fine, but not when your spouse has a legitimate need. Her comments suggest the balance is out of whack. She feels unsupported. \n\nI am curious why she is traveling; is it to help her family? Is she in a situation where she is going to be working/helping for four days and doesn\u2019t need the extra financial stress of getting home? And why don\u2019t you want to prioritize getting her so the whole family can go to the celebrations, even if you have to miss a few? Why is this the hill you are trying to die on?\n\nThere is missing info, but you seem to be the biggest AH, OP.", "NTA. I travel for work and drive myself to the airport all the time. It sounds like something else is going on here. Does she dread visiting her parents? Has she expressed frustration that you are not attentive enough to her in other situations? Does she feel that you don\u2019t care if she is leaving?", "NTA. With the price of gas it would be way more expensive to drive there and back twice than just pay for the parking. Kids would be miserable, money and gas would be wasted. Sounds like a horrible idea.", "NTA - not fair for her to expect you to ruin the day you planned for you and the kids. She could always see if she can reschedule the return flight so you can drive her back after 3pm if it\u2019s such an issue for her", "I get the not wanting to miss the parade and not wanting to do the 4 hour trip x2.

I'm going ESH you for just telling her to drive and her for demanding you take her and pick her up. If your town is anything like ours the parade starts at 10:00 am and is over around 11:00 so you will miss the parade if you pick her up, but you can do the other activities. Can your wife changer her departure to later or earlier so you can do more of the festivities.", "NTA. You and your kids will miss the festivities. Get your wife to drive herself home. It\u2019s $8 a day and she\u2019s away for 4 days. Not a lot IMO. But having fun with your kids at the festivities? Priceless.", "NTA the math doesn\u2019t add up.

I don\u2019t think ~$40 for parking is an unreasonable exchange for your kids to fully enjoy the festivities without having to worry about leaving early and missing something or trying to cram too much into one day and ending up with exhausted, cranky kids plus a parent who just arrived back home from traveling. \n\nBut you could probably work out a compromise. Did you compare the cost of an Uber to bring your wife home to the coat of parking? Personally, if the costs were about the same and I were your wife, I\u2019d much rather take an Uber home rather than schelp all my luggage out to the parking lot while sweating buckets in the July heat and then get into a hot car.", "NTA. Even without activities planned, I can't imagine anyone thinking putting kids in the car for a total of over 4 hours is worth it when there's an alternative. If she can drive and won't be coming off an unreasonably long and exhausting flight, she should be grateful for the peaceful drive home before getting back into mom mode. \n\nI know that some people ascribe very important social value to airport rides. Maybe that's where to start with her. Does it have meaning for her beyond practical logistics i.e. does she believe this is a fundamental marker of a successful marriage, does she believe only pathetic losers have no one to pick them up from the airport, etc. It's one of those things that some people just hold as deeply entrenched values, sometimes without ever really being conscious of it.", "Uber is a thing", "NTA, I have a kid and dude that\u2019s not feasible.", "NTA is Uber or train an option? Why didn\u2019t she consider this when booking the flight?", "NTA.  Dropping her off and picking her up from the flight would take about 4 hours.  I\u2019m totally at a loss for why she needs a personal 4 hour chauffeur and is making this some kind of relationship test.

How old are your kids? You state this event is something you want to do. What else is at the fair that is pulling you so hard bc as you state there was something you missed last year that you want to make this year? Are you going to be walking around with two kids for four days without a car? Or how will you get around?\nEdit: YTA.

She's being selfish. Go make memories with your kids.", "ESH - frankly, I think both of you are being a little dramatic and one of you just has to compromise. \n\nThe kids can come with you to drop mom off. 9-3 should leave some time for you to take them to the festivities afterwards, granted it's fair that you might miss some stuff you had originally intended to go to. \n\nOn the other hand, she's being over the top about the idea of just driving herself, you have fair reasoning to request that, parking isn't going to break the bank, and the loaner will likely be fine. \n\nThis sounds like a larger problem than this instance in a vacuum. The quip about her Dad not hesitating and you being selfish tells me that arguments about who is going to compromise their ideal scenario in order to help the other person are probably frequent. It sounds like she feels under-prioritized and is lashing out because she feels this should be an easy thing for you to help out with. It sounds like you feel that your desires are equally undervalued. In this instance, I don't think it matters who is \"right\" or who would have an easier time compromising - you both could compromise, it's just about who is actually going to be the bigger person to do it.", "Info: do you only have one vehicle?

How d are your kids?\n\nEither way yta, I know driving 2 hours and being gone 9:30-11:30 is during prime time, but it doesn't sound like you tried to figure something out beside her doing everything herself.

Could you drive her, then have the kids stay with a friend or babysitter to go to the festival for the 2 hours, then come back and take over the rest of the day?", "Nta especially with all these flights being canceled lately.

I enjoy doing things with him and the kids. I would be waiting to hear how the trip went. I don't know enough to say if anyone is the AH, but I can't imagine choosing a parade over time with my spouse who had been off. He may need to decompress from the family time or be anxious to tell me about the fun he had. Time is precious. Kids grow up and move away. People pass away or grow apart.

You could easily go pick her up from the airport and still be able to participate in the festivities, with your children *and* wife.

That says a lot more about your personality than it does hers. She tried to communicate with you and asked you to support her, and you couldn\u2019t even be bothered.

Also, do you guys have no friends who could pick her up? Normally if you\u2019re parking in an 8$ lot it\u2019s not even close to the airport.

Not doing so is kind of manipulative", "Then start later. You can still play with your precious water guns in the afternoon. And fireworks are like the main point of this holiday", "Dude, your wife is flying home to say goodbye to a dying love one. What she needs for support right now is for her husband to be there for her when she gets back (which isn\u2019t something you don\u2019t even have to guess at - she told you as much). Instead, you\u2019re more worried about trying out the new water guns you bought and posting on Reddit for validation. On top of that, after what will be an extremely emotionally trying experience, she wants to come home and watch the fireworks with her family, and you\u2019re like \u201cnah, will be too tired by then because of all the fun we are going to have without you.\u201d You\u2019re being a massive a-hole. Given the fact you\u2019ve also said you\u2019re having marital issues, take a close look at what you\u2019re doing here and the message you\u2019re sending your wife. It\u2019s definitely not the message of someone who loves and supports her during an incredibly tough time.", ">So rather than driving her to and from the airport, he\u2019d rather play with the new water guns. \n\nYou're kind of shitty for twisting the situation like this. He's taking his kids to a holiday event that they're excited to go to, not kicking back with his buddies and playing with toys. His wife is a grown ass woman, and she can handle driving herself to and from a funeral.", "He didn\u2019t say anything about \u201cterminally Ill\u201d for all we know, this could just be a really old person. Either way, it\u2019s manipulative to pull that card.", "Generally speaking (but I also live in a city, not in the boonies) cabs will have a set airport price. I obviously can't guarantee this would be the case in your situation.", "I live in a place with a rural airport and we still have ride share busses and Ubers that specifically target the airport (especially since we don\u2019t have a lot of available rental cars).", "Yeah all the airports near me offer shuttle/ bus services. Not sure where they live but i assume they offer one. Even if op has to drive 15 min to get her it\u2019s better than the hour + it\u2019ll take to get her from the airport", "tbh, felt purposely omitted.", "Of course he\u2019s not going to edit it \ud83d\ude02 he left it out on purpose to get more sympathy", "Yes, in this case YTA because you should be supporting your wife in any way in which she needs it at this time, especially since you say there are other marital problems. She's probably upset you can't go with her and at least in this way you could provide some support. Also, it would teach your children a valuable lesson that family comes before parties.", "I hope others see this to get the whole picture YTA", "Ok thank god I scrolled down and saw OP being called out. They are a fucking asshole", "OP is stepping up BIG TIME. You think its easy to solo parent multiple kids for 4 days?", "But, this doesn't really change the underlying logistical truth. Him picking her up will mean the kids miss the parade, with the family stuck in a car 2 hours over lunch. The kids will be cranky all the way there and all the way back. They've already missed the parade last year, and I bet the plague shut the parade down before that. \n\nShe is demanding that her husband and kids support her in this *very specific way*, which is not convenient for them, and lashing out as a result. \n\nI feel for her, and get that her headspace is not exactly clear. But fighting to the death for this ride isn't helping anyone and setting everyone up for frustration.", "I don't understand why they can't have a 4th of July celebration the following weekend. I'm sure that after his wife gets home she'll need some time to decompress, and while it won't be the parade, I've NEVER heard of kids getting upset about going outside to have water play. Is 4th of July the only day they are allowed to play with water guns? Can he not take the kids for a late celebration? I truly don't understand. Why can't he model to his kids how to delay gratification to love their mother?", "Dude is worried about *water guns* more than supporting his wife. It\u2019s not about the Iranian yogurt indeed", "The 'my dad would help my mom\" comment was what tipped me off someone was dying. it's out of nowhere, which means its a projection of feelings shes struggling with. dono which one or if its them, but ppl get weird when grieving. the introduction of new instability, a reality where that person is gone or will be soon, fucks with ppl and their ability to be direct when communicating.", "You're right that its the surfacing of other issues.  Im going to end up driving her, because sometimes thats how things go.", "Yeah, I wasn't going to make a judgement but there's a lot of context missing from the original OP as written too.", "He\u2019s leaving his wife alone to grieve and offering no support. Yeah, the kids should have fun, but he needs to be there for his wife", "Oh wow, I'm the one twisting things?

I took the \"not \\[here\\] for much longer\" as someone who doesn't have much time due to an illness, but old age could also very much be it.", "Definitely was. If it was added then a good portion of the N T A comments would be changed.

She\u2019s upset about him being completely unsupportive", "It absolutely was. Before I started reading the comments, I was reading it out loud to my husband and when I got to that part, I paused and told him this smells like \u201cmissing missing reasons\u201d.

He doesn\u2019t get ass pats for that.", "Oh wow, parenting his own kids? For 4 whole days? Let me call the engravers, see how OPs father of the century trophy is coming", "They\u2019re his own kids - he should be able to parent them for four days.\n\nMarriage is a partnership.  Right now she needs emotional support and she isn\u2019t getting it.", "4 days? *FOUR DAYS?!?* Military spouses seem to manage for months at a time.", "Lots of people do. But that\u2019s not \u201cstepping up\u201d\u2026 that\u2019s just being a parent. He has to step up his game as a parent. He should also step up his game as a spouss. He admits to being an AH many yimes in the past - so maybe not when her family member is dying soon?", "Family is more important than a parade. Would be a great thing to explain why we put down a parade to support our grieving moms. Js.\n\nIf my family member was mourning, i\u2019d drop a parade so fast. Diff values i guess", "Dude, the obvious answer is they don't go and he supports his wife.\n\nWho gives a shit if kids are cranky/unhappy, they are fucking toddlers and can have that rectified with a trip to micky D after the wife is picked up. The fact that he is prioritizing alleviating his kids boredom over supporting his grieving wife is objectively asshole-ish behavior.\n\nThe underlying logistical truth doesn't matter because the stakes are so low that you just cancel the parade trip and support your fucking wife.\n\nThis dude sucks.", "That\u2019s life. Sometimes, we don\u2019t always get what we want. I\u2019ve wanted to go to my college homecoming for a couple years and something always happens with a loved one that prevents me from going. I don\u2019t dig my heels in and pout, I prioritize people I love who need me. \n\nIf they have family or friends nearby, the kids can go to the wet parade with them so he can go support her. If they don\u2019t, that sucks for them. Kids do get cranky, and that\u2019s another part of life. Even kids don\u2019t always get to do what they want. That\u2019s an important life lesson. \n\nHere\u2019s what he could\u2019ve done differently: ask his wife how he can support her. She may not feel comfortable driving or getting a ride share while deep in grief. That\u2019s understandable. Maybe there are other ways he can support her if a ride isn\u2019t on the table. But based on how he hid the info from his post and admitted their marriage is strained because he\u2019s a self admitted asshole in other scenarios, it doesn\u2019t seem like he cares about the support she needs, he just doesn\u2019t want to drive and wants to play with his water gun.", "I don\u2019t think you or many other people in this thread understand how stressful and expensive it is to get rides from the airport. Especially if it\u2019s with a rental car-are you kidding me?", "Parades are not important events.\n\nKids don't get to do everything always. Do you have any idea how many events and kids activities there are? There are a million and one events they're going to miss out on because it's just not convenient. This being one of them *does not matter*.\n\nThere are fun things you can do the day before, the day after, and even when you get home from the airport. Kids are not that hard to entertain.", "I agree. I'm not really convinced that the reason for her flight is a reason he has to pick her up. He can support her without driving an hour each way to pick her up.", "True, he OP does seem a bit unempathetic. The wife's response does seem to allude to him not being supportive in other aspects. There's just a ton of information that we need still. \n\nIs she being needy? or is he truly not being supportive in their marriage? Tough judgement to make without more info about their life.", "What was the father comment? Looks like there was a lot omitted.", "I hate when people start assuming things that you don\u2019t really know. Getting a ride to the airport has nothing to do with being supported. You are over reaching here. It\u2019s should be about the kids and I don\u2019t know any kid that wants to be stuck in a car for over 2 hours on a day, so mom doesn\u2019t have to drive herself.", "More like a participation trophy.", "Military spouses also choose to marry members of the military and people considering singing up.\n\n\nBut, hey, since you want to make it a competition: They also parent even when a family member is dying- lots of people do because they have no choice.
