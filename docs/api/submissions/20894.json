Anyone with children knows that a 2 hour round trip on google maps doesn't equate to a 2 hour round trip in reality. OP needs to leave at 9 or before (the beginning of the 4th of July event) and then once they get back from the airport (which, will certainly not be at 11:30, even if the flight lands at 10:30 (if you've flown post covid you know how often flights are being delayed) there's still deplaning and getting through the airport, kids having to pee so getting out of the car, etc, so you're lucky if everyone is home by 12:30, then kids are hungry, then they have to get ready to go to the event, they're lucky to catch the last hour of it. Let's face it folks (I'm guessing a lot of people concluding it really only is 2 hours are reddit teenagers and the chronically online who are generally childless) picking the wife up totally prevents the kids from enjoying the parade.\n\nLet's also consider this: OP isn't some deadbeat dad wanting to hang with his buddies on the fourth. He wants to take THE KIDS to a kid centric event. The wife wants him to sacrifice that so she doesn't have to drive. Seems like this family can spare $32 so money isn't an issue.\n\nAlso, the judgement that he's TA, or even an E-S-H, because he originally said he would do it is such a playground ethic. As people, especially parents, learn more details and consider how these factors affect their children, they need to be able to shift what they're doing.\n\nThis a father who wants to take his kids to a very fun event on a major holiday they've known about all year instead of sticking them in the car for the day so they can pick up their mother. OP's wife benefit? She saves $32 and doesn't have to drive herself for 2 hours, and is willing to take this over the incredible joy of her children. Let's ask this question, why is this mother willing to return to her disappointed children for a bit of comfort instead of her incredibly happy children?", "NTA for putting your kids first when she is fully capable of driving an hour home herself and then joining the festivities if she chooses to. It seems selfish of her imo.", "NTA She is making the decision to visit her family by flying. The other factor you didn't mention in this is the possibility of flight delays or cancelations. Are you supposed to sit at the airport with your kids in the car for an indeterminate amount of time if her flight gets delayed from holiday weekend chaos? Her plan would have you and the kids miss out on enjoying the holiday so that she can can have fun with her family. If she drives herself, gets a friend to drive her, or uses a car service these problems are entirely eliminated. Just be sure to check how the loaner car would be covered if it's stolen. She is not thinking logically on this or taking your kids' enjoyment of the holiday into account. She is TA for trying to use guilt and comparing you to her dad.", "NTA\nDo the activities with the kids and let her either drive or do a ride share. This really isn\u2019t that serious", "NTA - airport pickup and dropoff is a luxury and a PITA. Either my wife or I offer the other if the stars align just right - otherwise we hire a cab.\n\nLoaners don't \"sell\" while they're being loaned - that's not how that process works.\n\nParking wouldn't be $100s. It would be $32.\n\nHaving said that - you could pick her up at 11, be home by noon, and still attend the festivities for 3 hours.\\*\n\n\\*in ideal conditions.", "NTA, but if she drove herself would you just not have a car for those four days? You probably need to sell your argument better to her though and make it more about the kids. Perhaps she can take an Uber/Lyft home?", "NTA!  I travel for work, sometimes pleasure.  I take my car, leave it at a park/ride and take the shuttle, whether that's INTL or Domestic.\n\nI've had my husband take me once, it's just not necessary.  I don't understand her guilt trip at all....and what about her kids? Stuck in the car over 2 hours so the dad can 'support' her trip?  In what world does that make any sense?", "NTA.  That's actually four hours all told (drop off and pick up) in the car.  And it would cost her about $40 bucks to park.  Driving herself is a no-brainer for me without even considering missing the event.", "NTA. You should drive her to and have her Uber home.  If she lands at 10:30 you still have to get baggage and then it\u2019s an hour away. What if her flight is delayed.  \nHow old are the kids? Old enough to be really bummed about missing the festivities?  \nImo she is looking at it wrong by saying it\u2019s you supporting her vs. not supporting her. You could easily be an AH by saying how about you supporting your children and their social emotional needs?!  Do you have any mutual friends you could ask for a favor?", ">why can't you just support me through this and not be selfish?\n\nINFO:\n\nDoes \"this\" refer to the drive to and from the airport situation or is the reason why she leaves over the weekend something she would like to have your support with (at least in the form of being driven to the airport and picked up four days later)?", "NTA. She can Uber, it\u2019s really not a big deal. However\u2026\n\n\u201cMy dad wouldn\u2019t hesitate to support his wife.\u201d \n\nThe fact that that comment isn\u2019t scaring you is insane to me. That\u2019s something that someone says typically when they have been met with multiple instances of you not prioritizing them. I highly doubt her anger is just about this instance. She\u2019s comparing you to her father, saying you aren\u2019t doing something she knows her father would do for her mother. That is not good.", "NTA - the culture of upper class women (and middle class women pretending to be upper class) feigning complete helplessness outside of the home and requiring father or husband to deal with everything fell out of favour a few generations ago. Just like men are capable of cooking a meal, cleaning the house and looking after children, women can drive themselves to the airport.", "Info how would you get to activities if you don't have a car?", "NTA - I hate airport runs with a passion. It doesn't actually save money as you need some snacks, gas, TIME, TIME, TIMe, TIME... and then you probably will just grab some fast food along the way.  \n\nAn hour is a long ways. Thats 4 hours total driving, plus not being able to go anywhere, plus etc etc etc.  \n\nYes hunny, it does cost more. I know you want to be dropped off. But I want to spend the day with the kids at these events. Nromally, I would do it no problem. So lets just spend the extra cash to make sure the kids have a great day.  \n\nOr find a friend to drive her... my SO would not go for this and it would be a fight... so it is what it is.

That\u2019s telling me something else is going on.\n\n3. You said \u201cYOU\u201d wanted to do these festivities. Do the kids want to do this?

Seems like an easy compromise.", "What\u2019s public transport like in your area? There\u2019s usually trains or buses near airports. Get her use one of those. Does she really want your kids going on a 2 hour car journey when they could be at home having fun with their dad?", "NTA. Long term parking exists for this reason. No one should be obligated to drive to an airport because someone else is flying (twice even as she will return).", "ESH  You can't drop her off and then have her Uber or Lyft home?  Seems like there are alternatives that neither of you want to consider and are just making this a big issue.", "NTA - if you pick her up, that's two hours out of your day WITH KIDS IN THE CAR. I don't know about you, but my kids would not love just sitting in the car for two hours while waiting to do something super exciting. She can drive herself or take a cab. I would never ask my husband to drive me to the airport", "NTA. She planned her trip for a holiday and should prioritize her kids' experience over her own convenience. If she doesn't want to drive, is there an airport shuttle or rideshare service she can take to/from the airport in your area?", "NTA can't your wife get a taxi? Feels like the wife is being selfish preferring her being the priority over the kids enjoying time with their father. My husband and myself have often travelled solo leaving the kids home with the parent staying home. We always took taxis to and from the airport to make it easier for the parent remaining home with the kids.", "No. She has other ways to get to the airport that won't spoil the day for the rest of the family.

She\u2019s going on vacation to see family and have fun, so this is even more unfair. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you drop her off and then she gets an Uber or taxi home?", "NTA: There's this little app called Uber. Tell her to use it.", "NTA\n\nI'm surprised your wife just brush it off that she will ruin the parade for the kids just bc she is too lazy to drive herself. \n\nIf you want to be petty, tell her \"maybe your dad would do this for his wife, but MY mom would have never ruined an event for us kids just bc it was more convinient for her\" - but then you will have WWIII at home. The good thing is, if you do this i bet she wouldn't want a ride from you anymore (but is maybe also not coming back again from her visit). But honestly, she would deserve this back comment, her comment about her father was a low blow.\n\nBut its wild your wife is choosing this as her hill to die on.

Ok, cool.\" Thats how this conversation would have gone in normal families....", "NTA enjoy your day with your children.

Kids first in this case especially since they had to miss out some last year.", "Nta its rude to monopolize someone elses time like that especially when parking is only $8 damn dollars a day. You will spend more than that driving and extra two hours since it is round trip. She is being selfish here.", "NTA, I travel without my husband and on those trips I NEVER ask or expect him to provide my transportation to / from the airport. If she doesn't want to drive, OP's wife should book a car service.", "NTA. I'd def drive myself rather than Subject my husband to potential torture with my toddler when they could be having w bunch of fun. I was wondering about the cost but 8 a day isn't much at all lol", "NTA. Your wife is an adult, she can drive herself.

I have traveled extensively solo (even pregnant), and I would have never, ever asked anyone (husband included) to drive me to the airport. WTF is with people who make it sound like driving themselves to the airport & parking is a huge deal? Enjoy your day. You are absolutely not the a-hole. I can't imagine asking my kids to spend hours in the car and missing FUN things.", "NTA.  I would have loved it if my husband ever planned and took our children to an activity for them to enjoy.  It was only me doing g it alone for 20 years.  Plus, you and your kids will miss the whole thing if you pick her up.  Tell her to put her big girl panties on and drive herself.", "NTA.  She's being selfish by wanting the chauffeur treatment, thus depriving you & the children especially of the opportunity to enjoy the 4th of July festivities.  She should care about her spouse & kids enjoyment, not selfishly hog three other people's time.", "NTA .  Honestly, I'd be saying the same to my husband.  OPs wife has the ability to drive so she should. When you have kids 1) If you promise them something you should do it. 2) no trip is \"only\" set amount of time. You can easily make 3 stops on the way THERE. And then that's not counting the wait to get in, fight who is sitting where, are seat belts on? Well we can't go until seat belts are on. Then please stop touching your brother, no I saw him kick you but that doesn't mean we hit back. Blah blah blah. Anything with kids is an all day thing. No matter what. Car rides are miserable.  So no OP , you're NTA", "NTA, I recently had to travel and I left the car in long term parking. It can be cheaper than a taxi or the Airporter.

And more than a bit selfish. She should just Uber home. Then she doesn't have to drive, and when she gets home she can have a bit of quiet to unpack, do her laundry, and enjoy the silence before the chaos resumes.", "Give her $32 or tell her to call her dad. Why demanding the entire family sacrifice 4-5 hours out of a special day because she doesn\u2019t want to drive makes you selfish is a mystery. What is this 4 day trip for?

You drop her off for her departure and then have her Uber/Lyft home. This way kids can have a fun Independence Day and your wife gets home when she arrives.  Considering it\u2019s a holiday travel time chances are her flight could be delayed due to weather &/or airlines being short staffed.  Going with \u201cbetter communication is needed\u201d here.", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t a 1 hour trip to the airport, this is a four hour odyssey with the kids.  Mom can take an Uber.", "INFO: How old are the kids? You state that *you* are looking forward the 4th activities, what about your kids?", "What happened to Uber, Lyft or a taxi?", "NTA. Wife is an adult, she can find other travel plans.", "NTA, but I don't see why you couldn't pick her up and drive home.

She\u2019s being a little ridiculous.", "INFO Does your city not have transit to and from the airport?", "Yeah, and how much gas will it cost to drive 2 extra hours? NTA but there must be something else your wife is worried about. You're not being unreasonable but she is.", "Why can't you drive her there and have someone else pick her up or have a driving service pick her up?", "ESH she\u2019s returning at 10:30am. Not 10:30pm. You\u2019ll be back home at most by 1:30. Save the money and just take her to and from the airport. It also makes less of a chance that the car (loaner or not) will be broken into.\n\nETA: I saw I really good suggestion. Drive her there and Uber home. It\u2019s an expensive Uber ride, but it sounds like you only have one car and aren\u2019t fully thinking it through.", "NTA. \n\nGiven a moment though, did your wife realize that what you said makes sense? Especially after finding out how inexpensive parking is? You\u2019d pay the same amount in gas. I know I can sometimes respond negatively but given time can realize, duh, makes sense or I understand the why.", "ESH, but mostly you OP. \n\nHer concerns for taking the loaner car are legit, and the response \u201cI guess they wait\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense. They do not like it when the car is out of your possession, and if the fix is done before the days are up then they will expect it back pronto. I can easily see how the idea of leaving the loaner at the airport stresses her out. It is not the solution you think it is.\n\nI suppose she also sucks for asking you to agree before knowing the details\u2026but honestly she does not suck for expressing her expectations to you. \n\nPerhaps you ARE being selfish by using your kids as a shield. Your words were:\n\n>We didn\u2019t make part of last year\u2019s celebration and I was looking forward to this year\u2019s.\n\nYOU want to go to the \u201cwet parade\u201d, not necessarily your kids. So own that. You don\u2019t want to have to help her out. \n\nPrioritizing your own wants sometimes is fine, but not when your spouse has a legitimate need. Her comments suggest the balance is out of whack. She feels unsupported. \n\nI am curious why she is traveling; is it to help her family? Is she in a situation where she is going to be working/helping for four days and doesn\u2019t need the extra financial stress of getting home? And why don\u2019t you want to prioritize getting her so the whole family can go to the celebrations, even if you have to miss a few? Why is this the hill you are trying to die on?\n\nThere is missing info, but you seem to be the biggest AH, OP.", "NTA. I travel for work and drive myself to the airport all the time. It sounds like something else is going on here. Does she dread visiting her parents? Has she expressed frustration that you are not attentive enough to her in other situations? Does she feel that you don\u2019t care if she is leaving?", "NTA. With the price of gas it would be way more expensive to drive there and back twice than just pay for the parking. Kids would be miserable, money and gas would be wasted. Sounds like a horrible idea.", "NTA - not fair for her to expect you to ruin the day you planned for you and the kids. She could always see if she can reschedule the return flight so you can drive her back after 3pm if it\u2019s such an issue for her", "I get the not wanting to miss the parade and not wanting to do the 4 hour trip x2. But what are you going to do without a car for 4 days?", "So you'll have no car for 4 days, that will suck. I'm going ESH you for just telling her to drive and her for demanding you take her and pick her up. If your town is anything like ours the parade starts at 10:00 am and is over around 11:00 so you will miss the parade if you pick her up, but you can do the other activities. Can your wife changer her departure to later or earlier so you can do more of the festivities.", "NTA. You and your kids will miss the festivities. Get your wife to drive herself home. It\u2019s $8 a day and she\u2019s away for 4 days. Not a lot IMO. But having fun with your kids at the festivities? Priceless.", "NTA the math doesn\u2019t add up. And if you\u2019re that pressed for money, she should cancel that non-need of a trip.", "NTA. The airport will be crazy busy.", "NTA\n\nYou want to do a activity with the kids that only has certain hours.

There's absolutely no reason anyone from my family needs to be sitting in bumper to bumper traffic with me on 580.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think ~$40 for parking is an unreasonable exchange for your kids to fully enjoy the festivities without having to worry about leaving early and missing something or trying to cram too much into one day and ending up with exhausted, cranky kids plus a parent who just arrived back home from traveling. \n\nBut you could probably work out a compromise. Did you compare the cost of an Uber to bring your wife home to the coat of parking? Personally, if the costs were about the same and I were your wife, I\u2019d much rather take an Uber home rather than schelp all my luggage out to the parking lot while sweating buckets in the July heat and then get into a hot car.", "NTA. Even without activities planned, I can't imagine anyone thinking putting kids in the car for a total of over 4 hours is worth it when there's an alternative. If she can drive and won't be coming off an unreasonably long and exhausting flight, she should be grateful for the peaceful drive home before getting back into mom mode. \n\nI know that some people ascribe very important social value to airport rides. Maybe that's where to start with her. Does it have meaning for her beyond practical logistics i.e. does she believe this is a fundamental marker of a successful marriage, does she believe only pathetic losers have no one to pick them up from the airport, etc. It's one of those things that some people just hold as deeply entrenched values, sometimes without ever really being conscious of it.", "Uber is a thing", "NTA, I have a kid and dude that\u2019s not feasible.", "NTA is Uber or train an option? Why didn\u2019t she consider this when booking the flight?", "NTA.  Dropping her off and picking her up from the flight would take about 4 hours.  I\u2019m totally at a loss for why she needs a personal 4 hour chauffeur and is making this some kind of relationship test. Also, not really sure what a wet parade is all about, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s way more fun than driving to the airport.", "I think your wife is being selfish.", "NTA so she wants you and your kids to all be miserable so she can be lazy and not drive herself nope not a chance", "INFO \n\nIs your wife a nervous or inexperienced flyer?", "NTA. Enjoy your Independence Day with your kids! Your wife can handle a drive to the airport. Have fun!", "NTA That amount of protest feels like she\u2019d rather sabotage everyone\u2019s day cause she can\u2019t be a part of it rather than miss out.", "Is there a point to her trip or did she just plan it spur of the moment? How old are your kids? You state this event is something you want to do. What else is at the fair that is pulling you so hard bc as you state there was something you missed last year that you want to make this year? Are you going to be walking around with two kids for four days without a car? Or how will you get around?", "NTA. She's being selfish. Go make memories with your kids.", "ESH - frankly, I think both of you are being a little dramatic and one of you just has to compromise. \n\nThe kids can come with you to drop mom off. 9-3 should leave some time for you to take them to the festivities afterwards, granted it's fair that you might miss some stuff you had originally intended to go to. \n\nOn the other hand, she's being over the top about the idea of just driving herself, you have fair reasoning to request that, parking isn't going to break the bank, and the loaner will likely be fine. \n\nThis sounds like a larger problem than this instance in a vacuum. The quip about her Dad not hesitating and you being selfish tells me that arguments about who is going to compromise their ideal scenario in order to help the other person are probably frequent. It sounds like she feels under-prioritized and is lashing out because she feels this should be an easy thing for you to help out with. It sounds like you feel that your desires are equally undervalued. In this instance, I don't think it matters who is \"right\" or who would have an easier time compromising - you both could compromise, it's just about who is actually going to be the bigger person to do it.", "Info: do you only have one vehicle?

How d are your kids?\n\nEither way yta, I know driving 2 hours and being gone 9:30-11:30 is during prime time, but it doesn't sound like you tried to figure something out beside her doing everything herself. Parking at an airport easily adds an extra hour. Could you drive her and a friend pick her up? Could you drive her, then have the kids stay with a friend or babysitter to go to the festival for the 2 hours, then come back and take over the rest of the day?", "Nta especially with all these flights being canceled lately.

The other factor you didn't mention in this is the possibility of flight delays or cancelations.

Her plan would have you and the kids miss out on enjoying the holiday so that she can can have fun with her family.

If someone was returning from like 3 months abroad, maybe it would be a bigger deal, but 4 days away? It is so so easy to just drive yourself or grab an uber/taxi and not make someone else take hours out of their day to be your chauffeur.\n\nAnd that's not even taking into account that there are morning activities OP has been looking forward to doing with his kids.\n\n(I understand that this is generally the unpopular view, but it's something I just really don't understand. I always transit myself home from the airport, if someone wanted to drive me I would consider that going way above and beyond.

This isn't about support, it's about her insisting that her insignificant inconvenience of paying $32 so she can enjoy some family time is more important than preventing her husband and children from enjoying some family time. She's immature and selfish and knows it, which is why she's trying this line. This is everything about her winning and nothing about support.", "If they are in a standard suburban town all of the parades and such are walkable.", "Maybe they live close?", "Isn't it crazy how walking is a thing?", "Possible it is in biking distance as well. My parents had a trailer for the smallest 2 to ride in, we older 2 on our own bikes.", "In all honesty, if the airport is one hour away, it is 100% cheaper to park there for $8/day and pay $32 total than to take an uber back.

So OP's suggestion is actually the most optimal option.", "Totally this, he can drop her off, then they can find a way for her to come home.

Its just so unnecessary.", "Lol what? An Uber for an hour drive is gonna be hella expensive. Her exaggerated cost would be real at that point.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t they just pay for parking at that point and follow the plan that the husband mentioned? It legit accommodates everyone, whereas the wife is only thinking of herself. \n\nNTA, OP.", "Thank you! There is a middle ground here that saves money. Drop her off, then have her arrange pickup.

The expected delays this weekend are already bad. The earlier you fly the more likely you are to get out.", "Uuuh I haven't thought of that, OP, are you really okay with not having a car for 4 days? If anything, regarding kids, isn't it better to have a car available in case of emergencies?", "I\u2019m sure the kids would love to spend 3+ hours in a car instead of spending a day with their dad at a a parade.

Kids are only little for so long, he can hear about my trip when he gets home.", "Well you could say the same about choosing putting the kids in the car for 2 hours over enjoying the parade with them. I don't know how old his kids are but that is not nice for them when they could be having fun and quality time with their dad.", "Haha, yes, bc kids are famous for being very cooperative if you are under time pressure. And flights on holiday weekends are famous for being on time. And also traffic is usualy very low on these weekends ;)\n\nYou can easily double the 2 hours to 4 and maybe even a little more and then they are still only at home and not at the parade. The kids will be frustrated and fussy by this time from having to sit around in the car and having to wait at the airport (worst case for hours). The kids will see the last hour of the parade max. And the last hour of such festivities is when ppl start going home, the organizer starts cleaning up etc. \n\nSo instead of the kids enjoying the parade and wife joining them later if her flight is on time, they all would be frustrated and tired when they finally get to the festivities, the mood will be very bad and all in all it will be a miserable experience for the whole family - and everything bc mommy priorized her comfort over every other member of the family. Not really fair.", "She is getting to enjoy an extend weekend away from her kids and the only thing her husband has asked is her to drive herself so he does not have to spend 2+ hours in the car with their children picking her up.
