After 10 minutes of putting them to bed we hear giggling, from them so I got up to check while my girlfriend stayed in bed. They were painting on the white walls. I was livid. They also got it on the sheets and the floor. I yelled at them and they started crying. My girlfriend tried to make me calm down but I didn\u2019t want them in my house so I called their dad telling him to pick them up now. He came in his dressing gown telling what time do you call this. I showed him the mess and he put the blame on me.\n\nI told him if he controlled his kids once in a while none of this would happen.

I don't think it warranted throwing them out of your home at 10pm unless there is more to the story (like if you didn't invite them and they were foisted upon you).", "ESH\n\nThe brother should **not** have brought paint over with the kids.  Toys, yes.  Paint, no. He is older and has more experience with kids and should have known better.\n\nOP left the paint where the kids would have access.  The 6 year old knows better but kids will be kids.  OP should **not** have yelled at the kids for acting like kids. \n\nBoth adults need to apologize to each other.", "ESH - who sends their kids with paints to someone else\u2019s place?  I would not have let them use the paints at all.  But having let them use the paints, it was on you to secure the paints when the kids were in bed. As far as yelling at the kids, pretty sure most people would be shocked enough to yell.", "Esh honestly he shouldn\u2019t have even packed the paint with them you, should\u2019ve put the pain away but why would someone send their kids off knowing how they are with paint I would honestly not wanna watch his kids after this.", "He said 10 mins after putting them to bed, he heard giggling and went to check on them. That\u2019s not the kids in danger.", "NTA. Who sends their kids to someone else's home with paints. I find it crazy that so many people think this is normal though. I have 6 kids and none of them painted or colored on our walls. It's ok to teach your children lol.", "I mean, did you put the paints away and try to stop the excited kids from getting at them? Either way YTA for yelling at kids over something so easily fixed.", "INFO\n\n> clear wrapping paper\n\nWhat?", "He was supposed to control his kids from his house? How about you supervising the kids in your care? \nKids are going to be kids, especially kids that age. You blowing up and overreacting won't teach them anything. If you had handled the situation better it would have been a great bonding opportunity with you setting the example of how to treat people when they make a mistake.", "Nta.", "Yta. You shouted at a 6 and 3 year old... If you didn't want them to do that, take them off them before bed! Or not let them have them at all \nIt was irresponsible thinking a 3 year old would understand.\nWalls can be painted. You've scarred them children from you.", "NTA: Your brother is a DH for bringing the paints\n over to your house.", "Nobody will like me for this, but NTA. Good parenting move on your part? HARD NOPE. But then again... YOU'RE NOT A PARENT! Putting kids to bed should be it, that's why it's called bedtime? Yes they will try to subvert it, mine certainly do, but that's not excusable. You overreacted a little bit, but your brother is definitely overreacting as well. What does he think will happen when they're 15 and 18, breaking into buildings and just generally raising hell? Pretty sure the cops won't accept 'they're just kids'... Bottom line, you probably shouldn't have kids at this point in your life, but you didn't abuse your nephews and this should be a simple conversation about boundaries and expectations between your brother and you.\n\nAs an aside, *dressing gown*?!?! As in fancy bathrobe meant for sitting around and smoking cigars in? Who DOES that these days?", "INFO: Where were the paints? If you put the paints in the room with them, yeah, then you were asking for it. Still very bad behavior on their part. If they were just left out on the table or put on the counter or something to take home the next day, then N T A. \n\n6 and 3 are more than old enough to know not to paint on the walls!!! My 3 year old has access all the time to her crayons and has only once colored on something other than paper. And she was not even 2. So yeah... good parents will have taught their children not to paint or color on walls or anything besides paper. And a 6 year old really, really knows this. They got it all over the wall, sheets, and floor. Natural reaction to yell at them pissed off. Don't blame you for that OP. I think 99 percent of people would have automatically yelled, even if they calmed down and moderated their tone after initially yelling. And a good consequence for wrecking your home is having to go home. Honestly, they would have been cleaning the walls at my house until their dad came. I don't think you should have yelled at your brother though. It was not his fault. It was not your fault either. Kids were in bed supposed to be asleep. If my 3 year old did that I would have immediately had them apologize and start cleaning! I would not demand someone apologize to them for the natural reaction of yelling at them. I DO however think you should talk to the niblings and tell them how angry it made you that they painted your walls and that they were very naughty and knew better, but that you are sorry you yelled. That you were very mad when they destroyed your stuff. Ask them how they would feel if you wrecked their rooms or painted on their toys or something. I would ask for an apology and then reiterate that you are sorry you yelled. Then I would tell your brother you are ready for them to come scrub your walls clean. (Natural consequence) \n\nAlso, to all the people saying nbd and the paints are probably washable. Washable paints are a frickin joke. Especially if you have flat paint on your walls so just the washing will make them look dirty. But yeah, I do have some paint markings on my walls where my daughter's grubby fingers accidentally touched as she was climbing off the bench to go wash her hands. The floor if carpet, yikes. Hope OP has immediate access to a carpet shampooer or that sh*t ain't ever coming out.", "YTA.\n\n3 and 6 year olds with paint do kid things. What did you expect?\n\nYou're old enough to know that you shouldn't have left the paint with the kids. Then yell at them until they cried? And refused to apologize to the kids for your terrible behavior? Oof. \n\nI can understand being mad, but you should have reserved the anger for your brother, and asked for him to pay for cleaning + new sheets. Then you would be NTA, although a little silly in the head for not knowing how to properly supervise kids. Even if they snuck the paints into the extra room, you're still an AH for yelling at very small kids.", "NTA...I think I would have lost it a little, too.  You probably went off the rails a bit more than I would have...BUT...we all feel how we feel about people disrespecting our personal spaces.   \nI hope you and your brother both calm down enough to work this out.  Now, you probably know that a boundary is not having them stay the night at your house anymore.", "INFO: 30 yro in a dressing gown? Is that the Scrooge pajamas? A 30 yro is wearing that?", "NTA,\n\nyour house your rules", "Not sure if yta or just an immature 20 something that doesn't know kids do kid shit. \n\nI guess your brother should have told you not to give a 3 year old unsupervised access to paint. \n\nHopefully your brother recognizes this isn't worth not talking to you again and one day you'll probably grow up.  Certainly will be a long time until you can see his kids again and definitely not without supervision. \n\nOr maybe, you could collect any grain a maturity in your body that might be there, man up, apologize and try to move on with your life. Hopefully not having kids any time soon.", "YTA. You left them with access to paint what did you think would happen.", "YTA  for agreeing to look after children then not doing it. \nThey acted their age.    \n\nThey could have been hurt because you  did not watch them. children so  young need a lot of supervision. Thank heavens they did not try to run a bath or something.  \n\nYour brother cannot be expected to teach his little children not to act like little children.  You can be expected to do the bare minimum of supervision for little children in your care. \n   \nYou had his children for less than one night and  did not bother to control them.", "INFO:\nSooo you didn't apologize to the kids?", ">I yelled at them and they started crying\n\nYTA -  Kids do shit and whilst it's bad you need to teach them why it's wrong not yell. Your approach sucked. You yelled at them and then chucked them out of your house. You will absolutely NOT be their favorite Uncle so at least you got that out of the way whilst they are young.", "YTA your brother should have cleared the paint with you first. You should have put the paint up. A 6 year old should realize not to paint on walls. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s all washable paint so some soap and water should clean it up and wash the sheets. I get you were upset but your anger is over the top. Sounds like some brotherly issues going on and the kids got the raw end of the deal.", "You agree to watch your brother\u2019s kids & then flip out when they act like kids? What were you expecting from a 3 & 6 yr old? \n\nYTA", "YTA. The children acted like children. As an adult, it's your responsibility to keep things like this out of their reach. And it's never the right response to yell at a child.\n\nYou should definitely not be taking care of children. And hopefully never have children, ever.", "YTA I mean, calling him to come get them wasn\u2019t a bad move - natural consequences for the kids - but raging and blaming HIM? Yeah, AH. Also, like it or not, you were in charge. What they got up to while you weren\u2019t paying attention is on you.", "YTA - 99% sure it's washable paint. It's not easy to get permanent paint for kids these days. (Like for painting rocks)\n\nYou didn't put the paints away. You are mad at yourself and your brother but took it out on little kids. The moment you scared them enough that they started crying, you should have realized how much of an AH you were being and stopped yelling, got down on their level and talked to them.", "YTA. Parenting 101 for ya, always hide the art supplies. Your brother is right, they are 3 and 6 which means you as the adult are responsible for being aware and keeping things that kids that age shouldn't have out of reach. If you didn't want that responsibility, you shouldn't have had them over. Mistakes of course happen, especially as you are young but what makes you an asshole is not only blaming the kids but yelling at them and refusing to apologize.", "YTA- if you don\u2019t want paint in your home don\u2019t let them bring it or put it where they cannot get it. It\u2019s pretty easy to hide things from a 6 and 3 year old. \nI\u2019m not surprised you got upset but you made the mistake of allowing it in your home in their reach. My 6 year old knows to put things where her siblings can\u2019t get it and knows it\u2019s her fault for not putting things away but mistakes happen and I\u2019ll help her through.", "YTA. You left a 3 and 6 your own alone with in a room with the paints, that\u2019s on you. Should the 6 year old know better, yes but it is still borderline.

Get the children a huge pack of sharpies and a drum each to make up for yelling at them.", "NTA.   Why in the world did he send kids that small to someone else's house with PAINTS?  Yikes!   This was never going to end well.", "ESH except the kids", "YTA. First, for thinking your instructions were going to be enough to keep kids that young from touching the paints instead of putting the paint out of reach. Second, for yelling at the kids. Third, for the comment on \u201cif he controlled his kids\u2026\u201d As if controlling a 3 and 6 year old is possible.", "YTA yelling at a 3 and 6 year old makes you a bully.

OP is doing their brother a favor by watching his kids. Brother brings paint with him.  PAINT. After the kids are in bed,  they sneak into the paint and start vandalising the walls. A 6 year old knows that's wrong. If they don't it IS the brothers fault for not teaching respect for belongings,  or for bringing paint when he knows they aren't to be trusted with it.  Shouting might not be the best response but you can bet your butt I'd shout at anyone destroying my house -kids, animals, you, whatever. I probably wouldn't have called bro to pick them up but I'd be fuming about it all night. \nAnd to anyone that is saying OP should have been watching them more closely,  do you sit in your kid's room all night with your eyes peeled open watching them? No you do not. You put them to bed and leave. That's normal and expected. OP checked in upon hearing a noise.

OP hasn't answered my question yet.\n\nThough, yelling at kids at their age would probably result in them immediately crying, which will most likely overpower any inclination of a child to apologize for whatever mistakes he/she makes.\n\nMy kid at 2 years old knows how to say sorry too but he will say sorry on his own if he got called out without the yelling part. Yell at him and he'll most likely sob and cry. The sorry comes later when he's calmer.\n\nMy vote would most probably be that OP and the father of the kids are buttholes.
