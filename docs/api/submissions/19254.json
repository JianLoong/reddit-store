Worrying about who should apologize to who seems like the wrong focus! \n\n\nDIL's behavior seems unhinged. You don't mention any pre-existing problems in your relationship with your DIL. If this is new behavior, why aren't you and your son questioning what is happening here?\n\nIt sounds like you are assuming no comments have been made to your DIL about her appearance because no one specifically told you that happened.

She couldn\u2019t gain weight to save her life. When she went to the gym she could only do weights, no cardio because she lost weight too quickly.

She needs to talk to a doctor and she needs support from her family.", "Agreed. I think the way through this mess would be to apologize to DIL, NOT about what was said, but about how what she said caused her distress. You don\u2019t want to hurt her, you want to support her.

OP could say I want to make sure my son isn\u2019t criticizing your post baby body, or that you aren\u2019t comparing our pregnancy experiences because everyone\u2019s body reacts to pregnancy very differently.
