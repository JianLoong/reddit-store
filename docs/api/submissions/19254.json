Worrying about who should apologize to who seems like the wrong focus! \n\n\nDIL's behavior seems unhinged. You don't mention any pre-existing problems in your relationship with your DIL. If this is new behavior, why aren't you and your son questioning what is happening here?\n\nIt sounds like you are assuming no comments have been made to your DIL about her appearance because no one specifically told you that happened.

Within a couple of weeks, sure but most people leave the hospital in 1-2 days and at that point aside from pregnancy weight gain the uterus is still enlarged and most people are much bigger around the middle just from that.

She barely gained weight and she wears make up at home. Which btw, I think is fine, lots of people like wearing make up all the time.\n\nI think the mom of DIL is totally out of line, like it is not helping the situation. But I also think the DIL is an extreme reaction, why does she care that OP was so skinny? Because she feels inadequate, why does she feel that way? There could be tons of reasons, but if a person in your family is in so much distress over something so silly, you need to help them. OP is obviously right for telling the truth, not only that lying would have caused more issues, there is not a lie that would have solved this situation. The problem is that at no point OP is describing any concern for her DIL, or showing she wants to understand what the hell is going on that she is so mad that her son is not with his wife right now when she has recently given birth. Do you realize how crazy is to have soo many problems because a stupid picture? And do you realize how crazy is that OP is more worried about being right than her DIL? If her DIL was never like this and all of the sudden is acting hysterical for no real reason, it is actually something people should worry about and instead of focusing on \"am I right?\".\n\nAt no point OP mentions telling her DIL not to worry about those things because everyone is different, or talking about it with her son. They only talk about how crazy is that DIL is mad about it. I mean it could be that OP is doing herself a total disservice in the way she tells the story, but here she doesn't know if her son has made any comments regarding her DIL weight, and again she doesn't say if she asked or anything.\n\nSo for me what makes her an ah is that at no point I feel any concern for her DIL from OP. I would be worried that someone was so distressed about something so minor.", "OP said \"we decided it was best to leave\"", ">So anyway, my DIL asked me how long it took to lose my weight and to get back to \" normal\". I said that I wore my normal clothes home\n\nThat clearly means \"home from the hospital\". She's asking about how long, she's not just saying \"I wore my normal clothes at home\", that's not an answer to that question, and the grammar doesn't make sense to interpret it that way. \n\n>Then she asked if I really wore make up home\n\nSame deal. Not \"at home\", and based on its relationship to the previous question, it's clear she's asking about the same context. Home from the hospital.\n\n>I asked my son WTF was going on and he said she saw some pictures and didn't believe it was him as a baby, it must be a niece because it was impossible.\n\nGiven this context, it's entirely reasonable to assume the information she had came entirely from the picture. Both weight and makeup can be discerned in a picture. No reason to get info from anywhere else. Doesn't mean her husband didn't say anything, but it's not necessary to explain anything. The picture explains it. \n\n>Do you realize how crazy is to have soo many problems because a stupid picture?\n\nAbsolutely, everyone does, that's why OP posted here in the first place.\n\n>And do you realize how crazy is that OP is more worried about being right than her DIL?\n\nThat's not what I see. I see someone trying to figure out how to handle this situation and having no real clue what to do. She's asking if she should apologize, despite knowing she did nothing wrong! She wants to help, she doesn't know what to do. And I'm not really sure she can do anything but support her son and tell him to get back in there. I'm pretty sure any attempt to get more involved than that is going to blow up in her face. \n\n>At no point OP mentions telling her DIL not to worry about those things because everyone is different\n\nIt barely sounds like she had a chance - DIL ran off crying, she thought it best to leave, it's not clear she's had a chance to talk with her since. With DIL accusing her of using drugs, I'm pretty sure she can't say anything that would not exacerbate the issue right now, she's right to stay away and not try to comfort her. \n\n>They only talk about how crazy is that DIL is mad about that.\n\nFrom what I can tell, they're barely a day into this saga. I think they're coming to terms with the fact that this isn't a normal situation. Taking a day to figure stuff out doesn't really seem like they're neglecting anything - it's a crazy, unexpected situation. Easy to give advice on the sidelines, harder and slower to actually *do* what needs to be done in real life, especially if you just don't know. \n\n>So for me what makes her an ah is that at no point I feel any concern for her DIL.\n\nShe's being accused and harassed, it's totally normal to take a minute to deal with her own emotions around that before keying in on why someone is doing that to you.\n\nShe's here to figure it out because she's struggling.

Obviously she is feeling insecure and dealing with a lot of emotions and physical changes that come with and after a pregnancy. You may not want to apologize because you think you didn't do anything wrong but sometimes an apology is just acknowledging how you made someone feel...whether it was intentional or not. You have to set aside the ego and being \"right\" and mend this relationship. Meet with her and talk and assure her that you weren't trying to put her down. Tell her you're there for her and you understand what she's going through. This is so simple. Then have a talk with your son. A long one. Make sure he isn't being manipulative showing her those photos, that he isn't making comments about her weight and that he is being supportive and an equal parent as far as helping with the baby.

Her husband didn't even show her the picture it was a picture in a scrapbook.  For DIL to try to accuse you of taking drugs is just unforgivable.   That is a stretch and reaching because she has envy over no weight gain.  I wonder if DIL is having PPD?   There is something going on with her emotionally.  This is an extreme overreaction.

It's in your best interest to support this new family, even if what they need (maybe a conversation between you and your DIL where you tell her you're very grateful for her, you are here to help her, and you never meant to suggest that she should have a different body than she does right now, and you're sorry your words hurt her) isn't necessarily what you think is most satisfying for you (have her admit that she overreacted and apologise to you for what her mother said).\n\nThe other mother doesn't have hormones and possible PPD to excuse her shit-stirring.

It's perfectly normal to never return to the weight/shape the body was, it's undergone too many permanent changes (it's not abnormal to get back there either though).  Obviously your DIL has been stressing about her body and your son's actions have been extremely unhelpful at best.  Given that she's kicked him out of the house it wouldn't surprise me for a moment to learn that he's been actively bothering her about why she isn't skinny again, holding you up as the example etc.  Then you reinforced this and made her feel terrible, she's upset and worried and you're now getting a lot of information second hand, as are your in laws.\n\nTalk to your son about exactly what he's said and how he's said it.

Surely you must know that for most women it is not common to just be \u201cback to normal\u201d so quickly and that weight gain is  normal part of pregnancy.

She just needs someone to tell her husband (and herself) that she\u2019s actually within Normal and that it\u2019s ok. \n\nHonestly you don\u2019t owe her anything, let alone an apology, but maybe you could give her some compassion and find a way to sit and chat with her about what she\u2019s going through. If that\u2019s not within the scope of your relationship, she would likely appreciate it if you told your son that whilst you and your daughters had similar experiences, that hormones and pregnancies and genetics play a part and that your DIL is well within Normal expectations, even if not the same, and maybe just needs a hug or some emotional support from him.", "NTA.

That and there are plenty of people who will tell a pregnant woman that she needs to lose pregnancy weight instantly, it doesn't need to be her husband that's coming from.", "My first two births, I was like you. Little pain and just got on with it. Was in Tesco with my second when he was barely 24hrs old. \n\nMy next two were c sections, the last being 8 months ago. He was 11lb 3oz and the last 6 weeks carrying him were exhausting. I had a much harder recovery and looked like crap 95% of the time (still do to be honest he\u2019s a really difficult baby). I don\u2019t usually gain weight during pregnancy, i actually loose it, but after this monster I\u2019ve put on weight post delivery and have had a few meltdowns about looking awful in pictures with him (I\u2019m really not photogenic at the best of times). It\u2019s normal to feel like that and sometimes fly off the handle. Doesn\u2019t mean my husband has ever said anything to me, other than I\u2019m beautiful.", "Sad but true. It doesn\u2019t make the wife an AH by accepting that she is feeling insecure about her body and maybe over reacted a little. She\u2019s a new mom and her whole life and body has changed, lord knows I had a few meltdowns after mine were born.", "I gained 40+ lbs each time I breastfed. I was STARVING the whole time. \n\nIt took me 2 full years to lose it each time. \n\nIn time long ago, I would have survived famines as would my babies I was nursing. But that\u2019s not helpful in current civilizations.", "Welcome to reddit, where if reaching for conclusions was an Olympic sport some of them would take home the gold.", "Unfortunately there seems to be a trend of explaining away someone\u2019s behavior by blaming *the husband/boyfriend*, instead of reading what is actually there.\n\nFixed it for you.", "I think its more funny the post doesn't even say he was being snotty it says she was being snotty about it, they litterally changed the words in the post to make him an AH.", "Ugh. So tiresome. Like every post by a female OP doesn\u2019t have dudes doing the same kind of thing. This is a people problem, not another fucking battle in your never ending gender bias war.", "Then claimed op was on drugs at the time."]}
