I told her I honestly thought it was really forceful to put that on parents and make them pretty much force buy your child gifts. She told me I was an asshole for saying this.

Years ago one of my best friends was a young single mother and the YMCA daycare was the only one where she could afford to send her son locally. \n\nAs a former daycare/early childhood teacher, I would heavily encourage you to reach out to the daycare director and inform them about what happened and tell them that you were very uncomfortable both with the gift request and the aggressive followup from the parent. That you have no problem with parents choosing to bring cupcakes or similar treats if they want their child to celebrate at school in general, but that making it an official \"party\" and expecting gifts from the other students puts you and the other parents in an awkward and unfair position, since just taking your child to daycare as usual (which working parents rely on for childcare) is perceived as \"accepting the invitation\". \n\nI genuinely have to wonder if this was okayed by a teacher or someone without supervisory oversight, or if they were unaware that the parent sent out a demand for gifts. This is SO deeply inappropriate. For sure you should say something to whoever is in charge. None of this is okay, and at the very least they owe you an apology and assurances that it won't continue to happen. You are definitely NTA.", "I've never heard of such a thing. When I was a kid, my mother had me bring in cupcakes or other treats for the class--and that was it. There certainly wasn't any expectation that my classmate's parents buy me a birthday present. \n\nMy own kids' birthdays were during the summer when school wasn't in session, but I would have done the same otherwise. It sounds as if this parent is in for a gift grab and is making up some nonsense in order to carry it out. NTA.", "NTA - My kids attended several daycares over the years (including a couple YMCA ones) and this NEVER would have flown at any of them.  What wild entitlement! \n\nI wonder if this mother bullied the daycare staff into doing this and, if you haven't already, I would speak to the daycare director because none of this is remotely acceptable.", "I\u2019m guessing that the daycare didn\u2019t know that the entitled mom was \u201cforcing\u201d other parents to buy gifts. Maybe entitled mom asked the daycare if she could bring in cupcakes for her child\u2019s birthday (like a reg school party) and the daycare didn\u2019t know that entitled mom sent out invitations with a gift requirement. I can absolutely see how this could have been done where the daycare had no idea and thought it was a typical \u201cbringing in cupcakes for the class\u201d kind of situation. \n\nIf I was OP I would mention this to the daycare manager to clarify if she knew about it (and can then decide whether or not to lodge a complaint about how inappropriate it was)  or if this was indeed a sneaky gift grab by the entitled mom- in which case the daycare should know about it anyway.", "This - there were often \"parties\" at the daycare, but it was bringing in cupcakes for the kids and sometimes a little party favor (pencils, crayons, a small toy). A gift was NEVER expected (or demanded for that matter).", "What? My kids were in YMCA care for years and yes, it was regional, but each individual center had its own childcare/day camp director who was always accessible by phone or text", "NTA and this is not ok.    You need to bring this up with the director of the YMCA childcare facility.", "Gift: a thing given willingly to someone without payment.

They also had cupcakes. Nobody treated it like a party. Nobody gave the birthday child gifts. There were no invitations. The daycare did reach out to all parents to make sure there were no children with a fear of clowns!\n\nAnother time, when I was an assistant at a preschool, we had a parent ask if she could bring in McDonalds happy meals at lunch time for all the kids as her son's birthday treat. We checked with all the parents and asked what their child would like. We did not allow soda. They all had milk with their meals and we offered fruit and carrots on the side. Again, wasn't a party. No invitations. No expectation for gifts \n\nBoth these parents told me they did these things because they wanted their child to celebrate with friends, but didn't need - or want - a bunch of gifts. It was also a good way to teach their kids that it was okay to not always receive gifts from everyone at every celebration.\n\nOP is NTA", "This is the way.\n\nMy kids' preschool allowed a celebration, but it was to let the kids have fun and lessons were worked into it (Earth goes around the sun in a year, etc.) The idea of allowing gifts at something like this is just bizarre."]}
