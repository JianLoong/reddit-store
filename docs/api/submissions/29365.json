Your gf is acting like her life is over and she won\u2018t ever experience anything ever, therefore everyone else who dares talking about their life is an Asshole rubbing her ,failed, life into her face.\nNormally I\u2018d say beeing petty instead of open communication is never the solution, but this person probably needs tons of therapy before anything you could say to her actually reaches her.", "That disrespect will continue.

Her response to being triggered about missing out is to tell you to shut up instead of -I don\u2019t know, maybe making plans to do the thing and fill in that gap in her experience with you?\n\n4.

Plus, it's incredibly egocentric to frame an individual's past history as a blow due to it being missed details.
