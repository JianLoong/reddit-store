Are you the asshole for throwing her bs back in her face? No. Her reaction is that of a self-centered asshole. \n\nShe tells you to hush any time you try to relate to things? sounds extremely toxic.", "Honestly man, anyone who uses \u201cbeing triggered\u201d to explain being an asshole, is a walking red flag.", "That's an easy NTA.  I can't imagine a healthy relationship where one partner wouldn't want to know about the other.  Sounds toxic tbh and I would be questioning the whole relationship personally.", "NTA. Share your stories with someone who actually wants to get to know you.", "Her brain sounds rotten", "Run away! This sounds like an awful relationship.\n\n\nAnd tell her that egocentrism and selfishness are serious triggers for you. And, you know, for any member of the human race. \n\n NTA", "Wow, NTA, it's just a paintball story, if that was my partner I would have kept the film paused for as long as he wanted to talk. Sounds like she has some issues that she needs to sort out on her own. Maybe talk about it when your both calmer and suggest going paintballing together so no one is \"missing out\".", "NTA \nSo she is basically punishing you because she didn\u2018t manage to experience certain things in life. \nAn Adult would want to get to know their SO properly and show interest in their lifes and would enjoy hearing small stories about the past. Also and adult knows that instead of beeing butthurt and making everyone else miserable, they could just start doing some stuff now, they feel they missed out on. Your gf is acting like her life is over and she won\u2018t ever experience anything ever, therefore everyone else who dares talking about their life is an Asshole rubbing her ,failed, life into her face.\nNormally I\u2018d say beeing petty instead of open communication is never the solution, but this person probably needs tons of therapy before anything you could say to her actually reaches her.", "That disrespect will continue. I\u2019d walk and find someone better.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds awful\n\nSeriously - she is not triggered by this. She's just an arsehole, and doesn't respect you at all\n\nThe next steps are up to you", "NTA. \n\n1. She has manifested an ongoing course of rude and dismissive conduct toward you.\n\n2. You trigger her because you have had more life experiences than her.\n\n3. Her response to being triggered about missing out is to tell you to shut up instead of -I don\u2019t know, maybe making plans to do the thing and fill in that gap in her experience with you?\n\n4. She responds badly to being treated the way she treats you.\n\nBin the whole girlfriend. She wants an audience member, not a partner. And she\u2019s making you unhappy.", "Yea nta", "She's an immature idiot, time to move on", "It's cool that you're dating the main character.", "ESH\n\nShe's being rude to you, but she didn't get that in the moment. It took her a few minutes to understand and then tried to explain it to you. That doesn't absolve her.\n\nYou knew it was rude, but you wanted to give her a taste of her own medicine and were intentionally rude to her. You could have made the same point by asking her if you did that to her right then, how would she feel, and she would have likely realized how bad that would make her feel. Instead you decided to just do the same thing, which didn't help you at all. Right?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
