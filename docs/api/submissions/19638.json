If it were just your podcast or your interview then fine, but it's something you're all involved in and by not discussing it with your colleagues you've decided only your wants matter. Discuss it amongst your team next time.", "YTA it was the work of three people, not only you, si you should have discussed it with them before, you have to get the agreement from everyone participating in a project to publish it", "YTA\n\nThat interview was the work effort and intellectual property of your group podcast.  Despite crediting your \"friends\", I'd like to point out the following:  \n\n1. you had no right to write/publish that without their consent  \n2. you monetized their work for your own benefit and at their expense\n3. your act devalued the podcast episode\n4. it sounds like you took all the credit UNTIL you got caught\n\nHad you approached your friends about writing an article, it may have been more equitable for all if it were done as a freelance piece.  One of your colleagues may have wanted or needed to write about it as well - and deciding who, if anyone, writes a piece on it should have been negotiated between the three of you.\n\nYou also exposed your company to some legal liabilities as the interview was not 100% of your own work. If I were your boss, I would probably fire you over this; I would definitely have an HR writeup on your file and fire you if you messed up again.   This is the sort of stuff journalists get fired over.", "Low key YTA. I understand your reasoning and motivation for publishing the interview in the magazine but you mentioned you do the podcast with 2 other friends who are essentially your partners. Considering one of your partners recently quit writing for the magazine, you should have had a conversation about publishing the interview. Maybe there would have been the option to publish the interview in a neutral magazine where your partner doesn't have a history with the boss and coworkers you mentioned.", "YTA.  If 3 people worked on it - all 3 people should be told and agree to publish.   Come on.  Your buddy just quit and you thought he\u2019d be fine with you publishing it?  No.  You didn\u2019t ask because you knew the answer and wanted to publish it anyway.", "YTA The interview is not your exclusive intellectual property. You had no right to publish it without their consent. You\u2019re even more at fault because you knew that your friend would oppose.

They seem like partners in this venture, you need to treat them that way and include them in decisions before they are implemented.
