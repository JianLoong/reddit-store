I haven\u2019t seen her in 4 years, and here\u2019s why.\n\nIn college, I met the girl of my dreams. She was everything I\u2019d ever wanted. Beautiful, smart, funny, and we had so much in common. We clicked immediately and started dating freshman year. Everything was perfect. I introduced her to my family and my parents loved her. She also became close friends with my sister, and they would hang out often. Her getting along with my family was important to me, and the final cherry on top that made me really think I\u2019d found the one. I was planning on proposing after graduation.\n\nThat was, until one day my friend sent me a picture of her kissing my sister. Apparently, someone had taken the picture at a party.\n\nI confronted her and she tried everything, saying that she was drunk, that it doesn\u2019t mean anything because that\u2019s \u201cjust what girls do\u201d. I was young and in love, so I accepted it and we stayed together.\n\nAbout a month later, her roommate texts me that she walked in on my ex and my sister in a compromising position. We had a big blow up fight that night where she admitted to me that she was a lesbian and in love with my sister. She begged me not to tell anyone, saying that her family would disown her and she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for the last semester of college without their help.\n\nI cut her and my sister out of my life, but I didn\u2019t out her. When my parents asked what happened to the girl they liked so much, I told them that she had cheated on me, but I never said that it was with my sister. This has caused strain on my relationship with my parents, since they don\u2019t understand why I no longer have a relationship with my sister.\n\nBeing told that what I thought was the love of my life was all a lie threw me into a deep depression, and I had to go through years of therapy to get back to where I am today. I\u2019m proud of where I am today, and I\u2019ve been seeing someone new for about a year now. I\u2019ve moved on.\n\nMy sister and my ex are still together. For all my parents knew, they had started dating after my ex graduated and we had been broken up for months. A few days ago, my mom called to let me know that my sister and my ex were getting married. She begged me to come to the wedding, saying that we could finally reconcile and she would get to \u201csee her family happy together again\u201d.   \nFor some reason, I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I finally told her everything.\n\nYesterday, I got another call from my mom who let me know that she and my dad had disowned my sister and would not be attending her wedding. For a second, I felt vindicated, but the more I think about it, the more I feel like I\u2019m dredging up the past. I\u2019ve ruined my sister\u2019s new marriage before it even began, and even though I hated them both for a long time, I can truly say that I don\u2019t anymore.\n\nReddit, AITA for ruining my sister\u2019s wedding?", "created_utc": 1681104077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h86lu/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 592, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
