I haven\u2019t seen her in 4 years, and here\u2019s why.\n\nIn college, I met the girl of my dreams. She was everything I\u2019d ever wanted. Beautiful, smart, funny, and we had so much in common. We clicked immediately and started dating freshman year. Everything was perfect. I introduced her to my family and my parents loved her. She also became close friends with my sister, and they would hang out often. Her getting along with my family was important to me, and the final cherry on top that made me really think I\u2019d found the one. I was planning on proposing after graduation.\n\nThat was, until one day my friend sent me a picture of her kissing my sister. Apparently, someone had taken the picture at a party.\n\nI confronted her and she tried everything, saying that she was drunk, that it doesn\u2019t mean anything because that\u2019s \u201cjust what girls do\u201d. I was young and in love, so I accepted it and we stayed together.\n\nAbout a month later, her roommate texts me that she walked in on my ex and my sister in a compromising position. We had a big blow up fight that night where she admitted to me that she was a lesbian and in love with my sister. She begged me not to tell anyone, saying that her family would disown her and she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for the last semester of college without their help.\n\nI cut her and my sister out of my life, but I didn\u2019t out her. When my parents asked what happened to the girl they liked so much, I told them that she had cheated on me, but I never said that it was with my sister. This has caused strain on my relationship with my parents, since they don\u2019t understand why I no longer have a relationship with my sister.\n\nBeing told that what I thought was the love of my life was all a lie threw me into a deep depression, and I had to go through years of therapy to get back to where I am today. I\u2019m proud of where I am today, and I\u2019ve been seeing someone new for about a year now. I\u2019ve moved on.\n\nMy sister and my ex are still together. For all my parents knew, they had started dating after my ex graduated and we had been broken up for months. A few days ago, my mom called to let me know that my sister and my ex were getting married. She begged me to come to the wedding, saying that we could finally reconcile and she would get to \u201csee her family happy together again\u201d.   \nFor some reason, I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I finally told her everything.\n\nYesterday, I got another call from my mom who let me know that she and my dad had disowned my sister and would not be attending her wedding. For a second, I felt vindicated, but the more I think about it, the more I feel like I\u2019m dredging up the past. I\u2019ve ruined my sister\u2019s new marriage before it even began, and even though I hated them both for a long time, I can truly say that I don\u2019t anymore.\n\nReddit, AITA for ruining my sister\u2019s wedding?", "created_utc": 1681104077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h86lu/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Revenge doesn't do no good and I can promise it won't make you happy.\n\nI don't think YTA, because you didn't do anything to ruin the actual wedding, you just said the truth and your parents decided to stop talking to her.\n\nBut please think about things for a second. Was it worth it?", "NTA for being honest with your parents. They are TA on overreacting on the disowning part. Time will resolve everything I\u2019m sure.", "NTA . you don't have to protect cheaters and users. They didn't care about you. You should you care about them.", "You can\u2019t control your parent\u2019s response and sharing the truth with your mom isn\u2019t wrong. You aren\u2019t required to hide the poor behaviors of others. \n\nNTA", "NTA- You didn't ruin anything... your sister and your ex did. The only thing that happened, is the that the truth was now out. They need to deal with the consequences of their behavior and what they *both* did to you. Keep moving forward, they don't deserve a second thought because they didn't give you one to begin with.", "Maybe not the asshole for getting revenge many years later. The one truly hurt by it all is your mother, when she came to you trying to pull her family together, and instead it effectively ripped it apart permanently. Your sister did you dirty, but if it wasn't her, it would have been the next girl, the relationship was already destined to end. The only thing that matters is if you feel you did the right thing, not what anyone on the internet thinks.", "NTA. You told the truth, and your parents made their own decision on how they reacted to it.", "NTA. You weren't being spiteful by telling your parents about it. You seem to have gone to a lot of trouble to not make this situation worse, and I think you're behaving quite maturely about it", "NTA\nYou didn't ruin her wedding, your parents did. What your sister and ex did wasn't OK, even with the added circumstances of having to remain closseted. But given that you are now feeling bad about what your parents did, they absolutely didn't do you a favour.", "NTA The gall of your ex and your ex sister. Seriously. They showed absolutely no remorse for what they did. Your parents didn't ruin anything, they just didn't support the cheating.", "NTA. Truth always comes out eventually.", "NTA-OP, please hear me. You DID NOT ruin your sister\u2019s wedding, life, or marriage. This is NOT on you. Your ex and sister made very bad decisions that hurt a lot of people, AND your parents make their own decisions. You didn\u2019t lie to them or tell them what to do. You simply informed them as to why you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to attend, and you have the right to discuss that with anyone you choose to. \n\nYou should not be feeling guilty. Please keep the therapy running to help you through this.", "NTA\n\nThis would be in bad taste if she'd banged a friend or roommate or something, but with your SISTER? \n\nThen to think you'd just go to the wedding and pretend nothing happened? Hells no!  If this was your sister's idea, then she got everything she had coming.  If she didn't know about mom asking, then it's just unfortunate, but still not your fault in any way.", "NTA. It\u2019s a bummer that your parents disowned your sister but you didn\u2019t ask them to do that. You just finally told the truth. It\u2019s hard to say what your sister does and doesn\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d, but none of its on you.", "I still haven't read the part where you ruined your sister's wedding.\n\nNTA", "Damn, that's quite a fix. First of all: YNTA.\n\nYour sister should have told your parents that her relation with your ex caused the break-up between you and your ex. Your sister not telling your parents put you in a complicated situation, whereby you were supposed to keep their relation a secret, whilst you were simultaneously severely hurt by their relation - it caused the break-up.\n\nYour parents disowning your sister is a huge and painful step. Possibly they refuse to take same-sex relations seriously, and/or are homophobic? That would explain why both your sister and your ex were shy to divulge the whole truth to your family...", "NTA. Your parents ruined their wedding. Your mom pressed and you gave her the truth", "NTA you kept it to yourself while your ex got her degree, you owe them nothing.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t tell them sooner.", "Nah you're definitely NTA..... But bro yo sister and yo ex they're the AH's. If they're actions towards bring consequences to them its on them. Glad you're doing better man and even happier you've been able to move on. Godspeed warrior", "NTA. You didn't ruin their wedding.  You told your parents the truth about something in the past, your parents likely spoke to your sister and then made their own decision about the present. \n\nIf you're doing bad about it though.   You could tell your mom that they have your blessing to go to the wedding, not that they need it. Maybe she feels guilty if she were to go, and this way she knows you won't be upset with her?", "The timing may not be great, but NTA. It's understandable to not want a relationship with your sister or your ex, but if you're okay with your parents having a relationship with them, you should tell them that they should talk to the sister and fianc\u00e9e and go to the wedding", "yta\n\nyou *clearly* did not \"move on\" and \"still hate them\". stop lying to yourself.\n\nhope it was worth it to you to cause even more drama after all this time. i mean, whats the point after holding it back for so long?\n\nimo you would have not been the asshole if you had told them right away but this? this sucks.", "You are \"dredging up the past\" only in the sense that a big shark has gotten stuck in your fishing nets and if you don't bring it to the surface to untangle it, you and it can never move on and it might come up and bite you in the ass some day.\n\nYou may rationalize to yourself that this is just an isolated incident, and not indicative of your sister and your ex's characters, but you'd be wrong. It's pretty telling that as soon as the truth was known, your parents could see how much of a betrayal it was for your sister to get together with your ex. You don't need to protect them.\n\nNTA", "NTA. The only reason you shared the truth is because your mom was pushing you to attend the wedding.
