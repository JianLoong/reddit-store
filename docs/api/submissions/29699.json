{"id": 29699, "submission_id": "17grlt0", "title": "AITA for leaving my room mate after she just saved me from homelessness.", "selftext": "So here\u2019s the whole story. This going to be long.\n\nI used to live with my parents and my brother. When my Dad passed away, my mom and my brother decided to move to another state. They left me a last minute notice and didn\u2019t offer or invite me to go with them.\n\nHaving no other option, I had to look for my own place. I can\u2019t pay the rent all by myself and I only had a week left at my current place so I asked my best friend to be my roommate. She was renting a room from an old lady who would knock on her door in the middle of the night to tell her to turn off the lights. In short, a landlord from hell.\n\nWithout any hesitation she agreed and we got our apartment. I had to do the hunting, the cleaning, decorations and stocking food and house supplies. All she had to do was to move in. \n\nI felt like I owe her from saving me from being homeless so I didn\u2019t even argue with her when she told me she wanted the bigger room. Almost twice as big as my room. Her only concern was the rent. She was previously paying $800 for her room for 3 years and she said it was affordable. I agreed that since the rent was $2200, she will pay $1000 and I will pay $1,200 even if I got the smaller room. So that it wouldn\u2019t be overwhelming for her.\n\nWe also agreed to paying half-n-half for all the bills. We only have one designated parking spot and I even agreed to have her park over there while I park 3 blocks away.\n\nNot a week into this, she\u2019s already complaining about how low class the apartment looks like. I didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nMonths go by and this keeps getting worse. She would never wash her dishes, never takes out the trash, never cleans the house but have the audacity to insult and complain about our apartment. She would always make fun of our place to our friends even when she didn\u2019t bought a single furniture, never decorated nor cleaned. I don\u2019t like confrontation so I kept my mouth shut.\n\nShe also ended up not paying half for our bills because in her defense she is already paying for our cable and wifi, which is like $70/month. I\u2019m left with paying $320/month for our utility bills.\n\nBut this is where I said \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d She bought a brand new luxury car, she asked me if we could carpool since our work is literally across the street from each other. I didn\u2019t want to agree to that so I told her I would think about it. I do a lot of stuff before going to work and I wouldn\u2019t want that time for myself to be taken away because I would have to be considerate of her schedule.\n\nThe day after she brought that up, she told me that she left her car at her job because she didn\u2019t want to damage and add miles to it and that she\u2019ll just take it home every weekend. She automatically assumed that I\u2019ll take her to work. Me, not trying to be an asshole, drove her to work. Being a people pleaser, I couldn\u2019t say no and this became an everyday thing. \n\nAlso, she told me that she would drive my car as being a passenger makes her sleepy. She drives my car so recklessly and would always insult my car. At first, I didn\u2019t say anything about it but after having to pay for bunch of repairs on it I told her to be more careful with my car the nicest way I could.\n\nI even brought up the fact that the car is very sentimental to me as my Dad gifted it to me months before he died. It was the last thing and only thing my Dad left me.\n\nCouple of days ago, she told me that we have to leave early because she has a nail appointment before we go to work. I told her to just bring her car home and she declined. I told her I have something to do with my girlfriend that morning and I can\u2019t go with her. She still declined and I just compromised like I always do. I didn\u2019t know that it was gonna take hella long for her to be done. We came to work an hour late and I voiced to her that I would stay at work an hour later than usual to complete my hours. Later that night, she messaged me asking where I was to which I replied \n\n\u201cI\u2019m completing my 8hrs.\u201d \n\nand to which she replied \n\n\u201cYou do like making things harder for me.\u201d \n\nJust like before, I didn\u2019t say anything back.\n\nAs we\u2019re driving home that night, I can sense that she was pissed. She was driving my car way recklessly than usual and she intentionally drove over a huge pot hole causing to break my car\u2019s exhaust. She just laughed it off. This was my breaking point.\n\nI kept quiet, messaged some of my friends, gave them the key to my apartment and told them to help me haul my stuff while me and my roommate were at work. That same day, I quit my job and left early without letting her know about my plans. Blocked her number and moved in with my other friends.\n\nI know a lot of you will tell me that I let her bossed me around and I wouldn\u2019t deny it. I didn\u2019t want to confront her as I felt like she did me a big favor but yeah\u2026 I realized how unfair it was down the road.\n\nSo please tell me, am I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1698308110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17grlt0/aita_for_leaving_my_room_mate_after_she_just/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I left my room mate without any notice.\n\n2. Because then she would struggle to find another room mate in a short amount of time and if she couldn\u2019t, she will financially struggle with paying everything by herself and/or will have to move out and go through that stressful process of finding a new place.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
