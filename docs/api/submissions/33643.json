Rules still apply.\n\nAfter some internal deliberating, we have decided to do something different this year. Basically, the mods would like to enjoy some holiday time with their families too! (I know, I know\u2026we\u2019re not supposed to have families - no spouses, children, etc. Also, no jobs, homes, etc. If it helps anyone maintain the illusion, we\u2019re taking a week to do laundry in mom\u2019s basement, because it\u2019s been awhile, and we are *ripe*!)\n\nThe sub will see some changes over the next week. We want to stress - this is **NOT** permanent! We will be restricting the sub at midnight, EST on the following days:\n\n* Christmas Eve\n* Christmas Day\n* New Year\u2019s Eve\n* New Year\u2019s Day\n\n**\u201dWhat does this mean?\u201d** Since the mods will be enjoying some holiday cheer away from Reddit, we will restrict the sub so that posts and comments can be viewed, but nothing new can be added. We realize this may be frustrating for some, but again, this is not a permanent thing!\n\nIn between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, we will have POO Mode active on all posts. That means December 26 - December 30th.  [You can read more about POO MOde here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023/)\n\nThis is being done as our Mod team is rather small for a sub this large and this active. Many of us are traveling to and fro, and tending to family matters (that Cheeto dust doesn\u2019t wash out of sheets easily!). \n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject, [We're currently accepting new mod applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/), so please take a look if you\u2019re interested! We review all applications, and while any help is great, those outside the US are most welcome! The more mods we have, the less likely we\u2019ll be to need to do this again next year.\n\nOn behalf of all the assholes roaming the halls of AITA World Headquarters, have a happy and safe holiday week! We\u2019ll see you in 2024!!", "created_utc": 1703365753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pf4gu/aita_holiday_break/", "score": 23, "replies": ["You're violating my right to craft a defensive narrative about my outrageous behavior, all designed to validate me in my righteousness. I mean, I might have to decide right from wrong *on my own* and, like many here, I'll be quickly in over my head. \n\nYou folks, please, take some well deserved rest and turn off the part of your brain devoted to AITA. Distance like that can do wonders. Enjoy the holidays, touch the grass or the snow or whatever, And forget about this place. What possibly could go wrong?", "Seems fair. Enjoy your holidays, mods and everyone else!", "Enjoy your holidays, mods! \ud83c\udf89", "Thank you, mods, for all of your hard work doing a thankless job! This is the best sub on Reddit, thanks to your efforts.\n\nHappy holidays!", "NTA, happy holidays!", "Do you guys have a go fund me for laundry detergent?   I'd contribute.  You guys earned it!  (JK!)", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 NTA .... This time. \ud83e\udd23. Enjoy your time with family and friends.", "Is it possible for the posts on the days themselves just be put into POO mode as well? I kind of like that idea better than having the sub entirely shut, sometimes people post here while in the middle of a drama and actually get helpful advice in the moment. \n\nI hope the mod team has a great holiday season?", ">You're violating my right to craft a defensive narrative about my outrageous behavior\n\nI think you have got the wrong end of the stick. The reason for this isnt YOUR outrageous behaviour - its ours. \n\nI think I can speak for the entire mod team when I say that we are all planning to commit acts so vile that they would have the Marquis De Sade throwing open the window and shouting for the police.\n\n After all, what is the festive season for, if not for bitterness, recrimination and wild, baseless accusations? \n\nAtrocities of the kind we have in mind neither happen spontaneously nor commit themselves.", "I gotta admit...this made me laugh.", "We debated about that a bit. But in the end, we decided that we really would like to have some family as well. POO Mode does a lot to help, but we stlil see rule-violating comments in those posts too. Rather than try to balance checking the sub with whatever we may be doing in our regular lives, we opted for this approach. \n\nI'll tell you it was a pretty quick and easy decision to go for POO Mode during the week, between the holidays though. None of us were comfortable leaving the sub restricted that long, so this is where we landed.", "Ohhh I didn't realize that you do still check those posts, I kinda thought it was a free-for-all, lol. That makes sense!! \n\nThank you again, I know it's a lot of work and a bit thankless at times!"]}
