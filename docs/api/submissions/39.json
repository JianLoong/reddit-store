When my husband was 3 years old, his mother married someone else and she had 3 daughters from that man. The man she married is much older than my MIL. Step FIL has olive tree groves. He harvests olives 4 months a year and spends the money he earn there all year. \n\nMy husband took care of every need of the house until he married me. He helped with the olive harvest. He took care of house repairs etc. After we got married, his SF got a mental illness because of his old age, thinking my husband did something even though he didn't do anything, and cut all ties. I did everything I could to reconcile them, but Step FIL didn't let my husband in the house. He even threatened to divorce my mother-in-law if she continued to see my husband. \n\nFIL's health has deteriorated further this year. He was hospitalized several times and suffered a partial paralysis. But since we all know that he will not be able to harvest olives this year due to his health, my husband made an offer to his family. My husband would harvest the olives and give ALL the money to his mother. All we wanted was the gas money we spent and a wage for our time. My husband works a normal 9 to 5 job, but would take his annual leave just to harvest their olives.\n\nHis eldest sister and mother said that they didn't want this, that they would rent the olive trees to someone else to harvest them and get a lump sum in return. They said that they would divide the money they received equally into 4, that it was more appropriate. If you couldn't do the math, let me explain; Sister number 1 (28), sister number 2 (22),sister number 3 (15) and my MIL. that's 4. My husband was suddenly ostracized from the family and we were shocked.\n\nYet we didn't say anything.\n\nWe just said, \"okay.\"\n\nSome time passed, then we decided to rent someone else's olives. We made a deal with someone and started doing this as a side job this year. Btw this is all because we have an 1 and a half year old and times are rough. We didn't have enough savings so we decided to make some money. \n\nSister number 1 called today and said that they couldn't find anyone to rent their olives, they were afraid of going broke, and that their elder brother, he should come and collect the olives.\n\nI said it would never happen.\n\n Because first, if they had rented the olives, they wouldn't have included us. They officially branded my husband as a half-brother. They did that, they went there. They knew we had a little baby and we were struggling, yet they didn't gave a shit. Second, we tried to help at first but they refused. We didn't even want anything anyway.\n\nMy husband said that he would not be comfortable if he did not help his family in such a situation, and that I was an asshole for thinking like that.\n\nNow I'm asking you; AITA because I don't want him to help my in laws?\n\nEdit: Sorry for putting \"not letting him\" in the title. I know he's an adult and I have no way of letting or not letting him to do something. I just don't want him to be abused by his family anymore.", "created_utc": 1667245977, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yimwyk/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_help_my_in_laws/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Yes I understand your husband was more than a son to that old fart but it has to end somewhere.) The way I see it - you and your husband have a sideline harvesting fitted into your lives and around his regular job. I don\u2019t knowhow your husband could take that much annual leave but if he again plans to just gift his mom his sister his labor when they wouldn\u2019t even pay his gas fare before, then he\u2019d be a AH to offer them that deal again and an AH to shortchange his wife and child. IF he does the harvest he should get the same share that any other harvester would get. Personally, I\u2019d suspect that other harvesters are wanting a larger percentage than the mum and sisters want to pay. Maybe you and DH could look around and find out what the truth is.\n\nps - get any agreements in writing, preferably notarized.", "YTA for sure. \n\nThe way you bringing this story across already seems very dodge. \n\nYour husband wants to step up for his mother and sisters knowing that this is their livelihood, knowing that because his SF is hospitalised and cannot provide for his family. \n\nThats being a man and you not allowing it because you want to be vindictive. \n\nYou should be proud of your husband for not allowing their actions to define who he is, his a man and what to provide for his family which includes you and your new baby. \n\nPut yourself in the position of his mother and ask yourself if you son had a wife that would not want him to help you put food on the table- what would you think of her? \n\nI say- accept, respect and support your husband decision to be himself and help his mother and sisters and despite it all.

He shouldn\u2019t have called you an asshole because it\u2019s understandable that you would feel protective of him and not want him to subject himself to that. They are definitely AH\u2019s and I would suggest to your husband that he make a deal that he will rent the grove and they will get a fair rental fee and you and your husband will keep all the profit. Make sure it is a fair deal business wise and get it in writing. He helps his family not go broke your family gets the profit for doing the work.

Orchard owners usually rent much more people daily to do the harvesting fast and quick. It's expensive too. So we hired one man and there's me and my husband. We could hire more people but like I said it's expensive to hire daily and we're trying to save money. My husband and the other man we hired they're shaking the olive branches with long sticks and I'm picking the olives from their leaves and branches. It's hard work and it consumes time so much. My in laws can't do it because strong men  has to do this job, they have to hit the branches with their big sticks and drop the olives with force.

He may or may not be ready to cut them off, and at the end of the day, that\u2019s his decision. Asking him for his end goal will help him open up about the situation and what he hopes to achieve. It may help him realize on his own that they\u2019re toxic and helping would be a waste of his time.
