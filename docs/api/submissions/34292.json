{"id": 34292, "submission_id": "18y2o08", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my car to my family, along with other personal belongings", "selftext": "Me (17m) am leaving for college in the summertime, I got into a huge private university in a big city due to scholarships for academics and tennis. Anyways my family doesn\u2019t have much money my dad passed and my mom is single providing for me(kinda) and 14f sister. When I was 15 I got a high paying job and saved my money, which I used to buy myself everything I ever wanted. This included a gym membership, a 20k car I bought and is in MY NAME, a 2k dollar gaming computer, PS5, and some other things. \n\nRecently talks in my family arose about how nice life will be for my Mom 39f and sister when I leave for college since they will get a new car(my car) and the gaming devices my sister wants. I informed them that I will be taking all those things with me to college and they are not theirs to divide amongst themselves. \n\nMy mom was furious because she was expecting a new car, for reference she drives a 2008 focus with 250k miles on it and I bought a 2019 jeep that has 45k miles on it. I informed my mom that if she stopped spending so much money on alcohol which she claims she needs from work stress and spoiling my sister with materialistic expensive crap, she could buy a new one and that it wasn\u2019t my job to provide her with over 30k worth of things I bought. \n\nShe responds if we are playing that game you need to give me back all the things I bought you, because besides basic necessities like housing, clothes, and food, she owes me nothing. I told her sure and gave her back my iPhone, then drove to Verizon and purchased a brand new one. When I came home with it she called me \u201cunbearable\u201d I told me once I leave for college, I\u2019m not welcome back, to which my sister agreed.\nAITA\n\nEdit: for some questions being asked she believes she is entitled to those things because she is a single mother and worked hard to provide me with what I needed. I also received many phone calls from family trying to guilt me into giving her the car because she needs it more than I do. I offered her a discounted price of 15k when I bought it for 20 and pay for the insurance, if she gave me the money I would give her the title. She scowled and I said she owes me nothing and will not be speaking to me until I give her my keys and title. I told her that will not be happening and now have taken back my original discount and want full price.\n\nAnother edit for some that have doubts: For context I was always the outcast of the family, my family believes in the church, and I was an accident(my mom doesn\u2019t even know the father) the \u201cdad\u201d I referred to was my sisters dad. He adopted me when I was 3. He was great and kept my mom in check, then he passed. \nAND FOR CONTEXT ON THE JOB- My uncle kinda took me under his wing, he felt bad for the way my family treated me sometimes. He is the manager of a restaurant on the water that caters towards yacht owners, sports teams, business men ect. He gave me a job there and allowed me to work similar hours to him(a lot) in reference to my \u201chigh paying job\u201d that means about 20-25k a year depending on business, which in my oppinion is high paying for a highschool student\n\nUPDATE: So against the advice of some I sat my mom down this morning and told her I wanted to amend our relationship. I offered to finance her a new car as she can\u2019t afford it and I would pay for the car payments but not insurance(I thought this was fair) \n\nShe was estatic and I told her to send me a list of cars while I was running some errands. Well\u2026 she wanted Camaros, electric vehicles, mustangs ect. I told her I do not have that kinda of money. I have used car money NOT new/nice car money. She got upset and asked why I would promise her something I couldn\u2019t no follow through on.\n\nThis hurt me because I was offering her a car that was nicer than her current one and instead of being grateful she was upset I couldn\u2019t provide her with a sports car with my HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL money. This finally opened my eyes to how truly bad she has become and I will be moving in with my uncle.

The county I live in prohibited homework during Covid and still has not yet taking this restriction off so I have never had any homework during my highschool experience. I just payed attention in class, did my work, and did well on my test due to paying attention in class. \nEDIT: also bulk of scholarships are coming from tennis but I did get some for academics as well. I\u2019m a pretty good little tennis player I fell in love with the sport because I have GHD(Growth Hormone defenciency) this means I\u2019m not very tall or big roughly 5\u20197 and about 130 pounds.

To add insult to injury, she had already attempted to manipulate you when she said you\u2019re not welcome if you don\u2019t give her money or property. You\u2019re 17.

A parent should be ashamed if they demand things from their kids due to desire.  That's what a child does.
