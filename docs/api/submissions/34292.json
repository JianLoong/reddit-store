Anyways my family doesn\u2019t have much money my dad passed and my mom is single providing for me(kinda) and 14f sister. When I was 15 I got a high paying job and saved my money, which I used to buy myself everything I ever wanted. This included a gym membership, a 20k car I bought and is in MY NAME, a 2k dollar gaming computer, PS5, and some other things. \n\nRecently talks in my family arose about how nice life will be for my Mom 39f and sister when I leave for college since they will get a new car(my car) and the gaming devices my sister wants. I informed them that I will be taking all those things with me to college and they are not theirs to divide amongst themselves. \n\nMy mom was furious because she was expecting a new car, for reference she drives a 2008 focus with 250k miles on it and I bought a 2019 jeep that has 45k miles on it. I informed my mom that if she stopped spending so much money on alcohol which she claims she needs from work stress and spoiling my sister with materialistic expensive crap, she could buy a new one and that it wasn\u2019t my job to provide her with over 30k worth of things I bought. \n\nShe responds if we are playing that game you need to give me back all the things I bought you, because besides basic necessities like housing, clothes, and food, she owes me nothing. I told her sure and gave her back my iPhone, then drove to Verizon and purchased a brand new one. When I came home with it she called me \u201cunbearable\u201d I told me once I leave for college, I\u2019m not welcome back, to which my sister agreed.\nAITA\n\nEdit: for some questions being asked she believes she is entitled to those things because she is a single mother and worked hard to provide me with what I needed. I also received many phone calls from family trying to guilt me into giving her the car because she needs it more than I do. I offered her a discounted price of 15k when I bought it for 20 and pay for the insurance, if she gave me the money I would give her the title. She scowled and I said she owes me nothing and will not be speaking to me until I give her my keys and title. I told her that will not be happening and now have taken back my original discount and want full price.\n\nAnother edit for some that have doubts: For context I was always the outcast of the family, my family believes in the church, and I was an accident(my mom doesn\u2019t even know the father) the \u201cdad\u201d I referred to was my sisters dad. He adopted me when I was 3. He was great and kept my mom in check, then he passed. \nAND FOR CONTEXT ON THE JOB- My uncle kinda took me under his wing, he felt bad for the way my family treated me sometimes. He is the manager of a restaurant on the water that caters towards yacht owners, sports teams, business men ect. He gave me a job there and allowed me to work similar hours to him(a lot) in reference to my \u201chigh paying job\u201d that means about 20-25k a year depending on business, which in my oppinion is high paying for a highschool student", "created_utc": 1704337880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18y2o08/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_car_to_my_family/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Spending a lot on car, gaming computer, and phones, when you could have got cheaper ones that did the job fine, is something I think you will need to reconsider if you are now going to be covering your living expenses rather than just the extras.\n\nIf you move away you will no longer have access to this job either.\n\nNTA, and I do think that your mother was TA to assume she would get your stuff, but perhaps you could try to look at things from her side. Perhaps she has sacrificed some things for you. I could be wrong, but these things are not usually clear cut.", "No worries at all, you seem very mature and hardworking. Is there a social worker at your HS? Maybe your uncle can help you take some of the advice in the thread.", "Doesn't make you sound like an ah at all.  You already offered to sell it to her and she refused.  If you can't find a place to keep it, sell it and put the money in a savings account for when you are able to buy a car again.", "It would be in your best interest to sell the car then place the money into multi year Certificate of Desposit at a bank/credit union with good interest rates then after college buy another car with the invested money.\n\nThen take the money you would be paying in gas and insurance and place that into an emergency fund.", "What is the high paying job that you got at 15 and how did you get it?  How many hour per week did you average and what was your pay per hour?  What were your daily responsibilities?  You have an unusual story, I think that people will be interested in these details.", "Understandably fond! :)   \n\n\nOffer it up, not as a negotiation, but as a gift (so you can\u2019t claim it back later, ever). \u201cHey sis, I\u2019m not really using this one, and won\u2019t have room to take it. Would you like it? If you\u2019d like to take it you can have it, otherwise I\u2019ll just leave it in my room I guess for holidays.\u201d \u2026 low key!", "She feels entitled to your stuff while you're in high school. Imagine how she'll feel when you're working ft.\n\nI would definitely stay with your uncle when you're home. \n\nYou might want to move your consoles to his house and keep your keys secure before letting your mom know you're moving. Give her key back.", "He definitely can and he has offered many times to allow me to live with him, I never took it up because I didn\u2019t think my mom would stoop this low, but she did. As for school there probably is a social worker but I\u2019ll have to check it out, I\u2019ve never needed one and currently I\u2019m a senior that doesn\u2019t go to school anymore. I have all my credits so I just do dual enrollment and stay home.", "I put that in the edit on original post but I can explain again I don\u2019t know much about how reddit works. My uncle once again helped with that he kinda became my parental figure because I\u2019m the black sheep due to my mom\u2019s poor sexual relationships.He is the manager for a restaurant on the water that caters towards yacht owners, business men, pro sports teams ect. When I was 15 he offered me a job as long as I worked similar hours to him(for transportation reasons) which was a lot. I spent literally all my time working, training for tennis, and school work. I especially worked many and long hours during the summer. The job isn\u2019t actually \u201chigh paying\u201d in the real world but it nets me around 20-25k a year depending on business, which is a decent amount for a highschool student in my oppinion. But I can see where my comment about it being \u201chigh paying\u201d could sound misleading and for that I apologize", "It\u2019s worth going in to see a social worker, especially because you are currently under 18. A social worker will know the specific laws in your area, and might be able to get fees waived, etc. If not a social worker, then a nonprofit or Legal aid, especially if you suspect identity theft. A good social worker (they are often totally overworked) can direct you to more resources. \n\nYou may also get some advice from the university you\u2019re going to, even if you\u2019re not yet a student. This unfortunately happens to a nonzero number of students.", "I have decided that I mostly believe your story.  Like all high school students, there are parts that are not 100% accurate, but it is close enough.  \n\nI would ask your uncle how to handle it, he is an important resource for you.  Not a bridge to burn.", ">around 20-25k a year\n\nAnd you spent a year's wages on a car and still had money left over to buy 'everything you ever wanted'??\n\nNot only are your fiction writing skills poor, your basic maths skills are lacking, too.", "Thanks for the support! I have no issues with my uncle he has taken no part in my families actions towards the car and the other things. I don\u2019t want to mislead or lie to people so if you are struggling to believe my story I live in the DMV, who do state online that there are not laws that prohibit minors from owning the title to a vehicle."]}
