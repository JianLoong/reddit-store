I didn\u2019t tell my parents what was happening for a lot of reasons. Here\u2019s why I think you should consider telling everyone now - it\u2019s rare that they do it to just one person. So there may be others that were hurt and also need support. You sharing might be what they need to share as well and for all of you to get the help you need. That might not be from your family. They may react badly. So find a therapist or community member that you can work with to take care of yourself.", "NTA\nI would suggest telling them, but preparing yourself for either reaction. Sometimes parents have a really really hard time accepting that their children were abused because it makes them feel guilty. It isn\u2019t necessarily a bad parent reaction, it is just a human reaction. Parents feel guilty if they failed to protect their kids. It is not your job to protect them from these feelings, but it is good to be prepared for the possibility of them. \nThere is a website called 1in6 that could be extremely helpful for you. \nI am sorry that this happened to you.

Aren\u2019t they your parents who care for and about you?? \n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t they believe you?", "To start with, you're NTA either way. But, by way of advice: the fact that your parents trust you and heard you enough to not push it & go without you is a hopeful sign to me. If they really didn't care about your feelings, they would have pushed you to go or tried to force the issue in some way. But, they didn't do that.\n\nSo, I think there is grounds for trusting them in return. Also, keeping something like that in will eat you up from the inside. You don't have to carry that burden alone.", "NTA You won't be ruining your family if you tell your parents. Let them sort it out. But here's the thing, he might be abusing other family members who might also not tell. Something to think about. \n\nTalk to your parents and tell them what he did to you and how you feel about it. You will have some relief then. Also, ask for help getting a therapist to work out your fears and anxiety. You won't be sorry. Take care OP.", "Yta", "Oh boy.\n\nFirst of all, you're NTA.\n\nSecondly, though, saying silent is not helping the family. If you feel up to telling them what happened, then you should do so \"for your family's sake\". They need to know about your cousin so they can protect other vulnerable family members from him. \n\nI understand if you find it difficult to tell your family, and if telling them would harm you in some way (for example, if your parents would stop supporting you before you leave college) then of course you must do what's best for yourself. But I urge you to consider telling them.", "NTA but you should tell them.  Your cousin may find someone else to do these things to. He needs to be confronted.", "NTA. You were the victim of this cousin and rightfully should not put yourself in danger by being around him ever again. Tell your parents why though. You may not be his only victim.", "NTA\n\nbut, bud, you need to tell somebody about what has happened over the years.  Trust me.  Keeping it a secret is only going to cause you more pain.   Doesn't have to be family that knows, but you need to unload this so you can move on emotionally.\n\nI kept my SA a secret for 40 years, and then the fucker showed up at my parent's 50th anniversary party, and tried to strike up a conversation with me.\n\nTook another few years, but, I ended up telling Mom, after making her swear that Dad never, ever, finds out.  She took that name to her grave.", " \nI didn't tell my parents what was going on for many reasons.", "I\u2019m not comfortable sharing the whole story as it does bring back memories I wish not to remember but if you need a little more information I can tell you a little", "Any extra information here won't help with the verdict... You're NTA obviously, there's no reason to traumatize yourself just to satisfy the internet's curiosity when we're probably already imagining something in the ballpark anyway.\n\nBut, for your own sake, if you're feeling like you can't keep your silence anymore, you should make sure that you share your experience for the first time in a healthy, supportive environment. That doesn't mean here, and that definitely doesn't mean with family if you have any doubts about how they'll react. Trauma like this is really, really serious and it's important to make sure you get what you need to heal and move on.\n\nI'm not sure what your cultural background is, but I'm 36M, and I've spent quite a bit of time with a therapist. Even just to help with through humble things like feelings during depression or anxiety around work, it's helpful to have someone to talk with. My mentor/cousin had a lot more trauma he grew up with, more like you... He's the one that normalized the idea of therapy for me. If it's not something you've seen others around you do you might not think it's for you, but it's just as important to see a trained mental health professional about these kinds of psychic injuries as it is to see a doctor about a physical injury. Healing alone and in secret is way harder than having a guide. I'd highly, highly encourage you to find someone with a background in helping people through childhood abuse, and starting to see them. Eventually, after a lot of work, you might decide you're at a place where you'd like to share with your family regardless of how they react, but you don't need to start there. There's help available. I'd be an absolute train wreck without all the support I've gotten (chronic depression and undiagnosed ADHD probably would have had me dead or homeless by now, instead of having a great job and a good relationship with my partner and kid) and you deserve to have a good life too. I really strongly suggest you look into getting help. If you're worried about money, there's often options for that too... You can imagine a lot of people who've suffered trauma like you aren't always able to get stable in life without getting help and support first. Hopefully in your country/city, there's good options available, and I bet a local subreddit might even be able to help you find those options.\n\nGood luck. I'm sorry you've had such a brutal burden to start your life off with, but at the very least, don't lose any sleep at all over doing what you need to do to live your life without crashing.", "I would think, yes.", "Not in this sub, and those sorts of workarounds really do make it harder for certain users", "NTA. Tell us first what did he do. We need more info before we Can advice you well.  All is strictly confidential. At Reddit, we are a nice family of strangers. Please, share how he hurt you..", "NTA. First, I'm so sorry that your cousin did awful things to you when you were young and vulnerable. Always know that you did not deserve any of it. He did bad things. He knew that they were bad at the time, that was why he did then secretly then and why he relies on your silence now. He should feel ashamed of himself and his actions every day, you deserve no shame and no blame. And you're not a 13 year old anymore. You are now an adult man in an adult body with adult resources. You're not alone, either. There are people in this world who will help you get and stay safe and heal into the best version of yourself.\n\nThe fact that your parents are concerned about you and why you don't want to go is a cautiously good sign. Ultimately you should decide whether to tell them or not. If you do decide to tell, I would suggest that you take the time that they are gone to write a letter to them that explains what happened and how it made you feel. Letters are good because sometimes it's easier to write difficult things than to say them, because you can refine your words to make the best possible point, and because you can speak your truth without being interrupted or questioned. When your parents come back, maybe you read the letter out loud, maybe you can give it to them to read. Or maybe keep the letter to yourself.\n\nI don't recommend calling them and telling them over the phone when they are with your family in a rushed way. The less you say now, when they are at the family gathering, the better. I feel like it would be right for them to feel slightly uneasy when they see your family, so they keep an open mind and they can look out for odd behavior.", "I had a \"funny uncle\" as a small child, I never could stand being around him and I never told anyone until later in life and of course, of course...nobody believes me. I don't know if you should tell or not. Will they believe you?", "The time to tell them was when it happened.

(Nothing like what you're probably dealing with; my issues stem from my military service) Look into counseling.  It helps, trust me.  I was stubborn and for years I refused.  I bought into that whole stigma thing that the military is famous for.  I had to hit rock bottom before I started going to therapy.
