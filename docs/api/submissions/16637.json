His girlfriend at the time got pregnant right after they graduated high school and I practically raised their baby girl up until they both graduated college and got jobs. During this time I had my full focus on my grandchild which caused me to very stupidly not pay enough attention to my daughter. We\u2019ve made up since and I\u2019ve been making up for lost time with her. \n\nThe issue is I\u2019m paying for her wedding but I never paid anything for my sons. I felt like I\u2019d already done and spent more than enough for their family that there was no reason for me to. I got them a good gift and a chunk of change and deemed it enough. He\u2019s been causing issues with me and his sister about this and has been slandering us on facebook saying it\u2019s unfair how I\u2019m paying for her wedding but not his. \n\nI understand feeling a bit bitter but I\u2019ve spent way more money keeping his family and him afloat than I have on my daughters wedding. Honestly paying for her wedding doesn\u2019t even seem enough for what I did.

Your son sounds ungrateful brat for you practically raising his child.", "NTA.\n\nYour son is extremely ungrateful.

But he is taking everything you gave him above and beyond that (years of parenting that you were absolutely not bargaining for until his surprise baby) completely for granted.\n\nYou really came through for him, and it's amazingly ungrateful for him to be bad-mouthing you like this.", "NTA\n\n Tell him you'll give him the money he spent for his wedding if he pays you back for raising his kid", "NTA.  Sit your son down and explain how his negligence as a father caused issues that go further than a price tag.  Ask if he realizes how ungrateful and entitled he is coming across.    If he wants to talk dollars and cents (or currency equivalent) then explain how raising a child for years is infinitely more expensive than paying for a wedding.  If he wants to continue then tell him he is about to find out how expensive losing contact with a parent is about to be.", "NTA. Like you said, you gave him financial support when he needed the most. You were there when it was important, because yes, I'm sorry but a wedding is not even an obligation. He should be thanking you, not causing issues for getting more money.

You provided much more support than most teen parents receive from their families. You raised your grandchild allowing him the opportunity to go to college, receive an education and presumably be in a better position to provide a good life for his daughter. Again, this is a luxury that many teen parents never get to realize.\n\nIt is time for your son to start adulting. He is a father with responsibilities and that starts with paying for his own wedding. Time to let him make it on his own and start giving time back to your own daughter.", "NTA. You raised their kid for years and now he\u2019s whinging you didn\u2019t pay for his wedding wow that is some level of ungrateful. Sorry he can\u2019t see the value in what you did for him.", "NTA you have done more than enough", "NTA: Your son is entitled and spoiled.  He needs to grow up; it's time he became a man!", "NTA.

It\u2019s time for your son to grow up.", "NTA some people are never satisfied. You could give him what he wants and there will always be something more you could have done.
