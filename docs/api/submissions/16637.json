First, if you go by tradition (which is dated, but still socially acceptable) it's customary that you pay for your daughters wedding and not your son's (you pay for the son's rehearsal dinner).  \n\nBut, more timely and more important, you have more than done your duty for your son and his wife (I assume they're already married?) by raising their son.  You gave them a generous gift for their wedding ON TOP OF raising their son.  You've done your job, and then some.\n\nYour son is acting very entitled and that's his problem, not yours.  You've done more than right by him.", "NTA... I think based on what you've described you've been handling this as best you can.  \n\nYour son is a brat though... using facebook to get at you.... just say what you said here.... you raised your grandkid while your son got on his feet, and if he isn't grateful for that then there's nothing you can do.", "NTA\n\nWhen parenting you give each child what they need. Your son didn\u2019t need a wedding.", "NTA\n\nIt went to childcare.

Explain that he alrdy blew through his share & that it isnt fair or healthy to publicly share half the details & allow ppl to judge you without giving them all the facts. That taking care of their daughter while they had time to get their shyt together & grow up is beyond priceless. Yet he still demands more?! I couldn't imagine putting something person", "Heck, traditionally NTA too. Traditionally, in the US, the bride's family pays for the wedding, not the groom's. At most the groom's family pays for the rehearsal dinner and maybe the honeymoon if they are feeling generous.", "I would say NTA given your specific situation.

Additionally, I believe tradition dictates that the parents help pay for their daughters' weddings but not their sons'.

You are a good parent for everything you have already done. I learned in my toddler\u2019s parent discussion that not all kids should be treated fairly or equally because each kid has very different needs and wants. It is simply not a matter of he she got this i get to have that too. Nope. Your son needed your time and money for a baby they did not have time and money for.

You think the son and his girlfriend would have been able to manage college and a newborn all by themselves?\n\nRaising a baby isn't cheap.

And a second, off-topic thought too: Could son be feeling jealous of daughter somehow? That she\u2019s marrying at a more \u2018appropriate\u2019 age, and without having spent her last teenage years as a parent?
