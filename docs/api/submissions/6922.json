Your coworker shouldn't be coming in late, but is it really necessary to make that many complaints about her? You're putting a target on your back and playing dirty because you think you deserve the promotion over her. I would tread very carefully because you are setting yourself up to be the person in the office that nobody likes nor can trust which may affect you negatively in the future.", "YTA - not your job or responsibility to manage the team. The only exception to this would be if they were impacting your ability to get your work accomplished, and the only information at that point would be to point out their input is lacking in your work. \n\nSet start times for work for sales roles as BS.", "YTA - You snitched on someone because you thought it would benefit yourself. No one likes that sort of behavior, and I would not expect to have a positive relationship with your coworkers going forward.", "Here is the issue to me. She is a single mom, and that stuff does happen. A little consideration should be taken for that. \n\nAlso, some people do have issues getting to places on time. And, it's not out of laziness or disrespect to the company. I tend to always run late due to my ADHD which makes getting anywhere SUPER frustrating. I have worked at being much better at this, but sometimes it does kick my ass. \n\nThat being said, I do clear it up with my supervisors when I have them (I'm mostly a gig worker, not 9-5, and this helps a lot), before hand and let them know that I have a tendency to be a few minutes late anywhere between 0-15 minutes. Now, it's gotten better than it has been in the past,  now is usually within the first 5 minutes. I always make sure my work gets done, I work super hard, and I tend to stay later to make up for the time when I am. Usually managers in the past have mostly been understanding. In case of emergencies, I call in to let them know anything beyond 15 minutes, because those are extenuating circumstances. \n\nAll that being said, my point being is, you don't know what her and upper management have talked about, she's obviously been there longer than you which means her being late someone hasn't caused a big problem.  And if she works hard, I don't see the issue of her being late because she has a kid, and those are, extenuating circumstances. I do see it as an issue with a scheduling if anything. Perhaps she should be scheduled to come in a little later so it doesn't cause issues?\n\nAnyways, my point is, you tattled on her to make yourself look better in the eyes of management when you don't even know if they already talked it out. How can you be trusted to be team oriented when you're just looking out for yourself?\n\nYTA in this circumstance. If she was also causing problems at work other than just latency, and if this wasn't just a competitive move to get that position, I wouldn't take as much of an issue with it.", "YTA. \n\nHer being late doesn't seem to impact your work day or duties at all, and by tattling on her the way you did, you're going to get marked as the office busybody who is willing to step on other people to get what they want. \n\nHR had already opened a complaint against her, and it seems like it was only a matter of time before they noticed another late arrival on her part. You didn't need to step in, especially since you admit in the comments you only did it since you're both up for the same promotion - that's just petty.", "YTA don't snitch, if it's actually impacting your work directly that's different, but if you're just reporting her in general that's an asshole move", "Well, it sounds like your intentions were to remove an obstacle out of your way so you have better chances for the promotion. No mention how her lateness affects your current job in any particular way because you keep mentioning it relates to the step up the corporate ladder. So, yeah.. YTA", "YTA\n\nIf she is doing a better job than you she deserves the promotion. Her bosses get to decide how important the time late are to them. \n\nSomething your missing that is really important is how well you get along with the team and your work environment is usually very important in most places.\n\nIf your on time for work, doing what's asked but your coworkers find you difficult to work with that's worse to many over being late.\n\nIf the other girl is late, doing what's asked and getting along well with her peers that may count for alot more.", "Well... Life is competitive, especially at work. You didn't lie or invented a story to get that promotion, you simply refused to cover her fault. She's chronically late and she should take it more seriously because 30 minutes delay 3 times a week is a lot. 1:30 per week x 4 is 6 paid hours a month to drive her kid to day care... It would be my company I would give her the choice to change her work schedule and be on time or seek job elsewhere...\n\nThat said snitching isn't the best. Would you have snitched for someone else who you wouldn't be competing for the promotion with? If yes, you're NTA because not covering for someone's mistakes is a policy. If no, YTA because it's kinda petty.", "YTA. Why are you snitching? You\u2019re sales people, so I would assume her coming in late doesn\u2019t impact you or your other clients. Also what happens if she\u2019s coming in late but staying later? There\u2019s so many alternatives. Also I can tell you don\u2019t have kids or you\u2019re rich because your \u201cI think she should hire a nanny\u201d is laughable. They usually cost 20-25 an hour on the low end. So if she hires a nanny that gets rid of a bunch of her exposable Income if she even has any as a single mom.", "YTA but I don't think you really care. You know you are, you are taking a calculated risk that by making her look bad, you make yourself look good. You are not a supervisor and this is not your business. I once had an agreement with a manager that for personal reasons my clock in time had a 15 minute window. A co-worker decided to rat me out because I was \"late\" once a week or soand instead of me being in trouble she got a dressing down for sticking her nose in where it didn't belong and for not being a team player, when word got around about (because she told a bunch of people she was doing it) and some people in the office stopped making small chat with her. Not to punish her but they didn't want something said to her ending up being told to our manager. (Noone besides me knows that she got in trouble and I didnt) I know because manager brought  me in to ensure she wasnt doing other things to make me uncomfortable and to warn me that she might be upset with me because she still doesn't know about the agreement, she was just told to mind her own business.", "Yta. You are so high up on ur horse I'm surprised you could reach a keyboard to post this.", "ESH. Reporting her for being late is a conflict of interest on your part due to the possible promotion, but she should be making proper arrangements if she ends up being that late so frequently. Don't instigate anything additional with her, you've already done enough. If the boss goes to you and asks whether she was late or not, don't lie, but don't bring it up without prompting. If the \"harassment\" is just minor and verbal, nothing extreme or physical, then I would say you shouldn't make a report unless it gets worse.", "YTA, focus on doing your job better than anyone to get the promotion. If you burn all your bridges putting people down to get there, you won't succeed anyway.", "YTA. Snitching on someone to get ahead is typically more of a hiring and promotion flag than being chronically late. It shows you can't be trusted to be objective in positions where you may be supervising others, that you will throw people under the bus to benefit yourself, that your judgment skills are lacking, and more.\n\nThey were aware of the issue. It was under investigation. You only accomplished showing your true colors.", "YTA \n\nYou reported her to be petty and remove her as competition for the promotion.\n\nAnything past that would definitely be seen as further retaliation", "YTA.  Mind your own business and stop keeping tabs on your coworkers.  Thats not your job.", "Question: Did you tell on her knowing it would increase your chances of getting promoted over her?", "YTA. You are legitimately just continuing to be a tattle to screw her out of a position you want. Child care, let me be specific, quality child care is not easy to find or cheap. Not to mention the limitations. You are already aware of the fact she is a single mom, in case you don't fully understand what that means, it means that she is doing the work of two people to care for a kid (how she got in that position is irrelevant). Her being a bit late is NOT effecting your ability to do your job. (Btw, snitching on her is not part of your job.) You are incredibly selfish, you saw her being late as your opportunity to screw her out of a position. Had HR noticed and reprimanded her on their own, then it's entirely on her, but you stuck your nose in it. Then you even have the audacity to want to go tell on her again because she was upset at you and told you about it. She's been with the company longer than you despite any issues she's had. The new position might even give her enough of a financial boost to afford someone else dropping her kid off at school. Since you obviously aren't aware, as I mentioned earlier, CHILD CARE IS EXPENSIVE! Mind your own business, I personally hope she gets the position you want.", "I'm going to say ESH because it sounds like you snitched on her primarily to take her out of the running for a promotion you want.  That being said, I had a co-worker at one point who was constantly late, constantly taking random time off and constantly taking longer lunch breaks than we were allotted always using her kids an an excuse.  It's unfair to the people who are at work on time doing what needs to be done.  My hope would have been that the person/people making the decision on the promotion would know she is regularly late and factored that in, but you can't change things now.", "Well, you snitched so that you could have a better chance at the promotion so yeah, you were being selfish. But, it's also her fault for being constantly late. I'm sure that being a single mother is tough but it also isn't an excuse you can keep using. I feel like at some point you should be able to figure out a routine in which you can make it to work on time but I don't have kids so what do I know. ESH.", "I was going to vote one way, but then reading your comments about \"she should've thought about that before having kids\" or saying she should just hire a nanny have changed my mind. YTA. And I hope you get karma for being a self-serving jerk with no cares for other people.", "YTA. Sales people can't afford nannies. You stabbed her in the back to get a job.", "YTA. They were right to call you a bee. It\u2019s not just as easy as finding someone else to drive her kid - maybe she doesn\u2019t have anyone to ask.

Do you have more work because she is late?", "YWBTA, if you go to management over your coworker. I'm sure they are already aware of her constant tardiness.

It's another to use it as a weapon to keep her from getting the promotion.  \n\nShould she be on time?  Maybe, maybe not.  That's up to her and her bosses.  Should you have used this as a way to keep her from getting the promotion?  Absolutely not.", "YTA Children are very time consuming, so taking 30 minutes to drop off her kid sounds reasonable. Does it really make a big difference that she gets to work a half hour later than you? The fact that your boss didn't even know until you told him suggests to me that it doesn't really matter. You're throwing her under the bus for your benefit. Major AH move.", "I don't think you are an asshole, but it was extremely petty and not a good idea, especially if HR were already aware of the issue.

I do think it\u2019s not a nice thing to do, but it\u2019s a pretty mild YTA.

And you\u2019re a little fussy about it, really I think your job should let people flex a little to drop their kids off if it\u2019s not hindering anyone else (like keeping them on shift etc.) but you don\u2019t work somewhere like that because HR was looking into this. Where I work, no one would care (we are remote but also flexible with start time etc though) and even many less flexible in person places will allow later starts or time shifting to pick up or drop off kids or do whatever these days. Sounds like you don\u2019t work at a great place if her being late/coming in at a different time doesn\u2019t impact the work but somehow is a problem. \n\nShe\u2019s right about you: You don\u2019t understand her situation or care to, but you\u2019re also not friends, AND you\u2019re competing, so why would you unless you were a nicer person than probably Is average.

Having to spend time doing the work of your coworker because they aren't there as much as they're supposed to be absolutely affects OP.  \n\n> No, it doesn't affect me personally most of the time.

Not a great way to start out in a new position.", "Yeah, I think OP is drastically underestimating how much they're torpedoing their own career here. Does they really think HR/Management are going to get together and ask \"So who here has leadership potential?\", \"Oh, that Simple Subject, they've been great about reporting every little transgression their teammates make, they'd make a great leader!\"", "Exactly.

You know you aren't qualified either that's why you're single handedly trying to knock out your competition. Nobody in the office, including HR, is gonna trust you from here on out.
