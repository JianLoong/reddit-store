We\u2019re not very close since we were both raised with our respective mothers but he has always gone out of his way to help me with anything I\u2019ve needed. Enzo married his wife \u201cSteph\u201d (33f) two years ago. Steph has a daughter, \u201cAlice\u201d (4) with her ex but has sole custody, and Enzo and Steph have a 7mo son \u201cTeddy\u201d. I also have a 3 year old daughter. \n\nEnzo and Steph moved to the city I live in when Steph got pregnant, and since then, Steph developed a habit of showing up at my apartment building unannounced. It became a problem and I talked to both her and Enzo about it and she stopped, until she gave birth. \n\nNow, she regularly drops by unannounced to leave Alice at my building for \u201cbabysitting\u201d while she has to run errands or something. She\u2019s had her carpool drop Alice off at my apartment before. My poor housekeeper is a wonderful woman who has had to deal with Alice arriving unexpectedly while I\u2019m out and I feel terrible about it. I\u2019ve told the concierge not to let her up and to say no one is in but then I\u2019ll arrive to Alice waiting in the lobby which is not safe and the concierge has told me I can\u2019t make them responsible for a child. Steph keeps saying she only does it when she\u2019s desperate but I don\u2019t see how she can be that desperate to run errands at least twice a week and frankly I\u2019m not a nanny if she\u2019s desperate she needs to hire some help. I\u2019ve spoken to Enzo and he is always extremely apologetic and says he will talk to her and I believe he does, but he also works during the day and can\u2019t police where she is at all hours. \n\nI reached my breaking point a couple of days ago when I returned from lunch to find Alice at home, having been dropped off since she had a half day at school. I apologised profusely to my housekeeper who had spent time playing babysitter and called Steph, no answer. I called her several times, and then Enzo, who was on a business trip and distraught over the situation. \n\nSteph eventually turned up a couple of hours later and I went ballistic. I said if she ever leaves Alice at my building again I will call social services and I will call them every single time she drops Alice off with me until they do something, because this is not my job and she is an irresponsible and neglectful parent. She burst into tears and begged me to help out with Alice but I said no and reminded her I\u2019d never said yes in the first place, she just kept dumping her kid here. Steph kept trying to guilt trip me but I was too exhausted and upset about the situation to be receptive and eventually my husband had to tell her to leave. \n\nI feel bad because as I said, Enzo has never been anything but the most accommodating person where I\u2019m concerned and maybe treating his wife like that was harsh, but at the same time I chose to have one kid because I don\u2019t want another one, Steph can\u2019t use my house as a daycare.

Explain to him what happened and that his wife clearly needs some kind of help- whether that\u2019s childcare or mental health.

Cause that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. \n\nTell your brother that next time she gets dropped when nobody\u2019s home is to call the cops.

She probably feels overwhelmed by motherhood and in her desperation she selfishly dumps her older child onto you, as I\u2019m sure the baby might still be breastfeeding. Regardless, she has no right to dump her child on you, especially unannounced or unasked. Poor Alice, her mother can\u2019t handle having a 4 year old and a 7 month old. You did the right thing.", "No, you were not too harsh. Something is going on and the problem needs to be identified and addressed, not avoided by dumping her child on you. This has the feel of PPD or Alice having behavioral challenges with the baby\u2019s arrival or one of the parents resenting Alice for being the odd one out in the happy little family.

A repeated pattern is not allowed.  \n\nShe was fine with her daughter when she was younger in the baby stage.  Now that she is 4 it\u2019s too much for her and she passes the buck off to others.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with daycares and Nannies mind you.  In these cases parents at least are providing for child in some capacity.", "NTA. She will continue to take advantage of you for as long as you allow her to.", "Nta.. if she\u2019s really running errands, she can take her child. \n\nCall away, that child needs to be taken care of properly.", "NTA, she\u2019s obviously not coping but they need to find practical long term solutions like hiring help, or getting her into daycare etc. Dumping their child on you and leaving her in potentially unsafe situations isn\u2019t ok.", "You're definitely NTA. Dropping a kiddo off without a heads up is not on, especially when you've already made it clear as crystal that this isn't something you're up for. You've tried to set boundaries, but it seems your sister-in-law just keeps taking the Mickey out of you. It's fair dinkum that you reached your boiling point.\n\nRegarding going ballistic, well, it's a bit of a grey area. If you just raised your voice, that's understandable given the circumstances. But if it crossed into cursing or really losing your rag, that's a bit more complicated. While it's never ideal to lose your cool, sometimes situations get the better of us, especially when it feels like we're being taken for a ride.\n\nIt's a tough situation with your brother being a top bloke and all, but at the end of the day, this is about setting healthy boundaries. You're not a drop-in daycare, and your sister-in-law needs to cop that on the chin. Hopefully, things will simmer down, and you can all find a way to move forward without any hard feelings. Wishing you all the best, and hoping this situation normalises sooner rather than later.", "Info. Was Alice within hearing distance for any of this?

To be honest I would be even more positive it was an affair if she wasn\u2019t taking her son.", "Absolutely NTA. \"Steph's\" poor planning does not constitute a responsibility for you. And  \"Enzo\" may have \"talked to\" her, but apparently has not effectively communicated.", "NTA. Please call CPS next time. Otherwise they will roll over you.", "NTA. Call CPS now. Why wait. It's not like they'll just roll up at a moment's notice when you call.", "Is her son a handful or a good kid? Do you think she is cheating on him?

I guess the problem I\u2019m having here is why not just talk to Steph? You were relying on your brother to do that but you could have sat her down and had a civil conversation. \n\nNow I know people will argue that she wasn\u2019t being respectful of you so why should you be respectful of her, but maybe if you had this nonsense would have stopped. Or maybe she would have explained why she was doing this. And then you could have told her to stop, or come up with a solution together or something.

No water bottle, no snack, no toy, and no way to find the potty. OP, straighten this out NOW.", "NTA. \nIf she wants help with Alice, she needs to go to the dad (unless he is unstable or anything like that). \nYou are right though, she is neglectful. You can\u2019t take your toddler and just leave them in a lobby. I\u2019m surprised someone working there hadn\u2019t already called on her.", "NTA. Do it!", "NTA. Sounds like she needed a stern talking to in order to get it through her head that you\u2019re not her kid\u2019s babysitter. Maybe things would have gone differently if she asked you upfront about watching her kid and you could have made a set schedule for those times if you agreed. But the way she has handled it is awful.", "NTA.\n\nshe is:\n\n1. being inconsiderate of you by not respecting you boundaries\n2. being irresponsible by not checking with you if you are available\n3. actually neglecting her child, knowingly leaving her in your house when you are not there.\n4. showing favouritism towards the new baby - she is always with him while she keeps throwing her older daughter at you.\n\nMaybe CPS getting involved is the wake up call Steph needs to become a better mother to her children", "NTA", "She\u2019s leaving her with your concierge, a stranger to her, and expecting them to watch her daughter? That is so so scary\u2026 for everyone. Concierge included.", "She doesn't call and ask first????? That's insane \ud83d\ude33", "Your reaction was warranted. Steph needed a reality check about respecting your space and boundaries.", "NTA\n\nIt honestly isn't really safe or legal for you to knowingly let her regularly abandon her kid \"with you\" when no one is really there to take care of the small child. It is possible that someone might also find that you, too, were guilty of neglect. When she figures out that CPS will be called every time she abandons her kid in the lobby she will probably very quickly stop doing that.", "Definitely NTA", "NTA. Not harsh at all. Steph has been very irresponsible here. This seems to be a constant issue so it needs sorting out.", "NTA. I suggest you ask your housekeeper to not open the door if it is Steph.   And if Steph just leave Alice at the doorstep, then housekeeper or you can call the police.", "NTA. Does she not have a cell phone? If she made sure you were always home I would still think you did the right thing but there would be some wiggle room for guilt, but she didn\u2019t. There have been times she has left her child in your lobby or at your door when you weren\u2019t there. That is abandoning a child. She isn\u2019t leaving her with you for babysitting, she is leaving her in a building in hopes of maybe you being there and babysitting. That is not safe. \n\nReach out to Enzo and ask him to make her MAKE her go through rigorous testing for post partum depression just to see if she is actually overwhelmed and if so get help for both children, and her. But it sounds like she is having some girls time or mommy and me baby classes and needs some consequences for those actions. Poor Alice, she has to feel like her mommy doesn\u2019t want her around.", "NTA - And let the building manager know they can call the cops to have her trespassed if she shows her face again.  They will pull in CPS for the child abandonment.", "You did what was necessary to protect your boundaries. Steph's actions were unacceptable, and you needed to stand your ground.", "Are Alice and your daughter not friends? What do they do with their son?", "NTA.  She left you only 2 choices: continue making your housekeeper or deal with her like this.\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t so bad, I\u2019d ask if you could do something like offer to pay for a sitter once every week or two if the issue on her side is finances (since you\u2019re well off enough to apparently have a full time housekeeper), but I think she\u2019d start doing the same thing to the sitter.", "NTA\n\nLong overdue.\n\nAnd send them a bill for whatever you paid to your housekeeper during the hours she was babysitting and not housekeeping.", "NTA but something is really wrong here between these two children and their treatment by their mother.\n\nYour brother needs to get a handle on his household. Children are in danger and something is going on.", "Nta\n\nI'm surprised the concierge didn't call the police for an abandoned child", "NTA for saying that to your SIL, but YTA for saying all that in the presence of Alice.", "NTA\n\nYou said your sil said she only drops alice over if she is desperate.  But you recently returned home to find alice there because she had 1/2 day of school.  Your SIL had to have known in advance it was a 1/2 day at school, so it wasn't an emergency and not a desperate need for a babysitter.  she also had to have had alice with her to get her to your place, so why not just take her home?\n\nI think your SIL is doing something sketchy that she doesnt want a child who can talk to be with her.  On the 1/2 day Alice was dropped off hrs before you returned from lunch and your sister didnt show up until several hrs later.  Thats 4 or 5 hrs and i cant imagine what would take that much time that is an emergency (since sil said she only drops alice off when shes desperate).\n\nDid you ask her what she was doing that required 4-5 hrs without her child?  The fact that she doesn't say where she is is another \ud83d\udea9.\n\nMaybe you need to share how frequently this happens with Enzo.", "NTA you should have called a Long Time ago", "YTA- try being a better person", "NTA. Do it! Steph is not entitled to your free services as a day care. I also think it is kind of sus. Where is the other child during this, and why does she feel the need to get rid of Alice so often?", "NTA. She may also flat out need to be told that you did not hire your housekeeper to watch her child. How unfair for her to be infringed on like that. Have you told her directly she is free to tell SIL that she is not babysitting/it's not what she's hired to do?", "NTA. And she is not even leaving her with you sometime s, she is leaving her with your housekeeper and with the building concierge, unattended in the lobby...", "NTA.

I think the threat of calling social services should make her understand you\u2019re serious. Your brother must put a stop to this. What a mess. I also hope it never comes to calling. Once they\u2019re involved things can easily snowball.", "> Enzo has never been anything but the most accommodating person\n\nYeah, uh, no. He apologises and says he's 'talked to her'. Sounds very wishy-washy and much like an excuse for him to stay on your good side enough that you'll keep taking care of Alice because _he_ at least is just _so nice._ He's basically doing the equivalent of throwing his hands up in the air and saying \"welp, I tried! Not my fault!\" then dusting his hands of the situation and leaving. If he actually wanted to help you, he'd discuss such options with her such as getting their own nanny or sitter, and be more pro-active about giving her consequences for her actions.\n\nIf she does drop Alice off, call the police on the non-emergency number. Or have the concierge or housekeeper do it if you're not home. NTA", "Absolutely not too harsh. Your home is not a daycare, and Steph needed to understand and respect your boundaries", "NTA. You have warned her that you will call social services, so do it. People can only take advantage of you if you let them.", "NTA. Unsafe situation for the child.", "Maybe I've been on reddit too long, but I get the feeling that her \"errands\" are a cover for male company.\n\nNTA. I work in a public library and parents often drop their young children off and leave to run errands and even go to work. You would not believe the types of people that come through our doors, and staff are not equipped to keep an eye on every minor in the building. It is basically the equivalent of leaving your child in a public park.\n\nWe call the cops if the parent doesn't come back to pick up their kid or answer the phone, because the safety of the child is always first. You have said yourself that you are often not at home when Alice is dropped off. What if your housekeeper had an emergency and had to leave early? What if the concierge was back-filled by someone else that day, and was a stickler for rules and had no experience with kids, and instead made her stay in the foyer while they helped someone else instead of watching her?\n\nThese might seem like far-fetched scenarios, but if no one has agreed to take responsibility for a child, then <i>no one has taken responsibility for the child.</i> Kids always come first.

I loved going with my dad too! It\u2019s very normal for kids to come.\n\nAlso OP NTA", "Same here. SAHM with three kids and no family.  When they were little, they went wherever I did.

She is up to something for sure", "I was a single mum with dad in a different province. If my son wasn't at daycare or on a playdate, he was with me, full stop.

I can't believe I didn't consider that here! But you make a valid point, albeit a gross one. OP is right that Steph can't possibly be \"desperate\" so often (at least not to run errands) and I can't think of any errands where she could take the baby with her and not Alice. You're very possibly right about an affair but the idea of someone taking their baby with them to cheat on their spouse is just...

It's unbelievable that someone would do less for a child.", "That's a good question. Post partum depression, mental illness and even abuse can alter your brain in such a way that the decisions you make do not make sense to others. Steph is acting selfishly. The question is why? Is this who she is as a person? Or is this behavior relatively new? What is going in with her that she's behaving in this way. It may be more than her her being a careless jerk.", "This is what I was wondering as well. Considering Steph doesn't work and Alice goes to preschool, I don't understand why Steph can't do her errands while Alice is at school, she can't possibly have that many errands that she can't do with Alice around? If she really needs someone to watch Alice more often than that, they should be hiring a babysitter or putting her in daycare so the fact that they aren't makes me wonder if they are financially struggling and don't want to admit it. \n\nBut I still keep coming back to the fact that someone who doesn't work can't possibly have that many errands, especially when Alice is in preschool, and that makes me wonder if she's just trying to offload Alice because she's mentally struggling to take care of 2 kids under 5, and since she has an infant, I wonder if maybe PPD is a possibility. I know this was happening before the baby was born, but it stopped when the OP complained.\n\nStill NTA... obviously, none of that excuses neglectfully dropping your kid off without permission with people Steph doesn't know well (doorman, housekeeper, etc) and aren't responsible for her child. It has happened enough times that at least threating to call CPS is warranted. But maybe have a talk with her/Enzo about whether they are struggling financially and whether Steph is suffering from PPD before actually calling CPS. I mean, if either/both these things are factors, I would want to help them out, but I would arrange reasonable, scheduled times I could babysit for them and stress that she has to stick to those times, she can't just randomly drop her off.", "Is it not totally transparent what was going on when they moved to town as soon as she popped preggers?", ">I am baffled by Enzo's lack of action in this thing.\n\nThe levels of weaponized incompetence some fathers will go to regarding their own children are pretty intense, let alone their step kid.

Why should OP accept that all this past babysitting is water under the bridge?", "No it won\u2019t, you can both halt services and bill for services rendered at the same time", "Make the price ridiculous.  \nOP pays housekeeper X/hour, charge 5X/hour for the babysitting", "Sounds like she doesn't have the money to pay back the housekeeper for services rendered. Tthe point would be made if OP specifies \"no owesies.\"", "Where are you seeing any line in the sand?\n\nOP is just rolling over while claiming to support the housekeeper if the housekeeper turns the SIL away? \n\nOP needs to get a babysitter on speeddial and uber that child to them when it gets left.\n\nWhen SIL turns up for the child give her the address and let her go pay and collect her child.", "I agree with all that, plus it's petty and she seems to love her brother, and Enzo has been there for her any time she's needed him, I think the money part is pointless and won't help with maintaining any family ties", "When my son was little he was in nursery 3 days a week. They struggled with people picking up their kids late, so they instituted a fine for late pickup.\n\nTurned out parents saw that as a fee for if they wanted to pick up later than usual so the number of late pickups *increased* instead of decreasing, as they felt they were paying the advertised price for the \"service\".\n\nUnintended consequences!\n\nThey switched to a guilt tactic - they'd send all staff home apart from the manager, and the late parent would arrive to the place in darkness and deserted apart from the manager's office, where they'd find their little darling sitting on the manager's lap.

Also since this started when Alice's mom was pregnant Alice probably thinks it has something to do with the baby. \n\nHonestly to me it sounds like it does. Alice's mom should have been a one child parent who decided to have a baby for Enzo and now all she has energy and effort for is Teddy. If reddit has taught me anything it's that there are a lot of parents out there that have more than 1 kid for whatever reason and THEN realize they should have stuck with 1. And for some reason a lot of them still have more after that \ud83e\udd26", "The baby can't speak but a 4 year old can and maybe the mother is doing something that she does t want the hubs to know about.", "Sounds like she's a one child mom that had two and is now regretting it.

Didn't have my third until 9 years later \ud83e\udd23", "I'm guessing she's got the baby. Babies are relatively easy to take to run errands, especially if you use a carrier. Preschoolers (like Alice) are not.  Babies stay where you put them. They don't say embarrassing things about the people around, they don't beg for everything they see.  Half the time they'll just get bored and fall asleep.\n\nPreschoolers want in the cart one minute and out the next, they run around, they get in the way, they comment about the world around them, including people (\"Hey mom, why's that lady so fat/old/in a wheelchair?\"), they beg for every toy/candy/even pretty outfit they see, they touch everything, they may have enough brainpower to sneak things they want into the cart when you aren't looking.\n\nIf SIL is driving it adds a whole slew more effort getting them in car seats. Again babies are basically dolls with no agency compared to a 4yo. Preschoolers even if they aren't trying to fight you can make it take forever. \"Ooh what's that thing on the floor?\" And climb down to check it out while you're untangling the straps. Take their shoes off in between every single store and you have to spend 5 minutes standing in the cold trying to get them back on.  \"I do it myself!\" Putting jackets on (which takes 4 times as long as a grown up doing it) meanwhile you and the baby are standing out in the cold waiting.", "To be fair, I have a 7 month old and an almost 3 year old. Since the baby was born I have been to 3 funerals, a celebration of life, a gala, a pub night reunion, and a couple of mom/baby play dates all of which I have taken my toddler to his grandparents' house for, but brought the baby with me. The baby is exclusively breastfed, and basically an appendage at this point, lol. My toddler has a lot more fun hanging out with his Nan and Papa than being made to sit still in a place not made for toddlers. This particular situation is vile and horrible, but it's not totally insane to think a mom might have a lot easier time doing things with a baby strapped to her chest than with a toddler who wants to run around and play and do all the things (with a baby strapped to her chest).", "Exactly my thought.  I'd find it more difficult to do errands with an infant than with 4 year old.  And Alice is definitely feeling like she's been shunted to the side for the new baby--plus the new baby's dad isn't Alice's so I'm sure there's a lot of sadness and anger on the part of Alice that's going to pop out at some point soon.  OP is NTA but Enzo needs to take care of the situation much better than he has been doing.", "OP said they don't because they know she's trying to handle this. They probably don't want it on their conscience either since it's not their problem, it's a family situation. \n\nThey will HAVE to at some point though for liability issues.", "This is the right way. They will call CPS if they deem it necessary.\n\nUsually getting a call from the cops about your abandoned child is a wakeup call for people who do this.", "It did! It worked wonders, and only our wealthiest of families (our area serves a very wide range of incomes from poverty level to multi-millionaires) would end up paying the fees. Most our families were regulars, so when it was one of our poorer families I usually just stopped the counter at the 15 minute mark and gave them unofficial verbal warnings. \n\nSince we were a city-run facility, all money went back into the general recreation fund for the city, and so was used on everything from daycare centers, to the overhead for Rec centers and playgrounds, to general landscaping, etc\u2014 really anything that came out of that portion of the city budget\n\n\nETA: the reason we did it at $10/minute was based on calculations of the overhead cost of keeping staff late and the building open. Our facility was connected to a school, which meant if one child\u2019s parents were late, we were required to keep the AC and lights for the whole building on and the school security had to stay late in addition to our own staff (not just our facility since the systems were connected). The city then just added a profit margin on top to make it an even $10 since our register systems were ancient and 10 is an easy number to multiply by", "The plot thickens\u2026", "You lil drama stirrer.

Perhaps even the idea that the newborn is someone else\u2019s and the SIL and even a clued in husband wanting to lessen the chances of running into an AP that might ask questions about who their little one looks like. \n\nI could see them moving for more standard reasons like better job opportunities, and SIL simply not knowing how to cope without a family infrastructure. Many, especially those raised without the money for outside childcare, are brought up to think of it as wasteful or untrustworthy and that could be driving her hesitance. Or she moved and with the new job, problems in the marriage are now popping up and she wants the toddler out of the house to conduct her affair. Or she could be struggling with some form of depression and addiction. Could be she drops Alice off and then mindlessly plays the slots for four hours. Could be that she\u2019s not depressed but simply exhausted by being with two small children for most of the day and is desperate to only have them one at a time when hubby isn\u2019t home.

SHE needs to be the first person to call the police.  If the doorman did it, the police would presumably show up at some point, the doorman would tell them the child was the niece of someone who lived there, the police would then attempt to contact OP while also trying to contact the parents, and OP would have to come give some statement anyway (because the mother would say \"I told OP I was dropping kiddo off, she said it was fine\" and then OP would have to say \"no it's not fine\").  OP calling herself, especially the first time, would expedite the whole process, as then the police would know she was on record as saying not to drop the kid off, and then if the doorman called in future, everything would be on record for the police to pick up the kiddo.\n\nI also doubt the building wants the circus of police standing around in their lobby with an abandoned child for hours, waiting for OP to show up and deny agreeing to watch kiddo.\n\nThis just isn't something you leave to your doorman, you deal with it yourself."]}
