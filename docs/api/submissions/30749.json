We\u2019re not very close since we were both raised with our respective mothers but he has always gone out of his way to help me with anything I\u2019ve needed. Enzo married his wife \u201cSteph\u201d (33f) two years ago. Steph has a daughter, \u201cAlice\u201d (4) with her ex but has sole custody, and Enzo and Steph have a 7mo son \u201cTeddy\u201d. I also have a 3 year old daughter. \n\nEnzo and Steph moved to the city I live in when Steph got pregnant, and since then, Steph developed a habit of showing up at my apartment building unannounced. It became a problem and I talked to both her and Enzo about it and she stopped, until she gave birth. \n\nNow, she regularly drops by unannounced to leave Alice at my building for \u201cbabysitting\u201d while she has to run errands or something. She\u2019s had her carpool drop Alice off at my apartment before. My poor housekeeper is a wonderful woman who has had to deal with Alice arriving unexpectedly while I\u2019m out and I feel terrible about it. I\u2019ve told the concierge not to let her up and to say no one is in but then I\u2019ll arrive to Alice waiting in the lobby which is not safe and the concierge has told me I can\u2019t make them responsible for a child. Steph keeps saying she only does it when she\u2019s desperate but I don\u2019t see how she can be that desperate to run errands at least twice a week and frankly I\u2019m not a nanny if she\u2019s desperate she needs to hire some help. I\u2019ve spoken to Enzo and he is always extremely apologetic and says he will talk to her and I believe he does, but he also works during the day and can\u2019t police where she is at all hours. \n\nI reached my breaking point a couple of days ago when I returned from lunch to find Alice at home, having been dropped off since she had a half day at school. I apologised profusely to my housekeeper who had spent time playing babysitter and called Steph, no answer. I called her several times, and then Enzo, who was on a business trip and distraught over the situation. \n\nSteph eventually turned up a couple of hours later and I went ballistic. I said if she ever leaves Alice at my building again I will call social services and I will call them every single time she drops Alice off with me until they do something, because this is not my job and she is an irresponsible and neglectful parent. She burst into tears and begged me to help out with Alice but I said no and reminded her I\u2019d never said yes in the first place, she just kept dumping her kid here. Steph kept trying to guilt trip me but I was too exhausted and upset about the situation to be receptive and eventually my husband had to tell her to leave. \n\nI feel bad because as I said, Enzo has never been anything but the most accommodating person where I\u2019m concerned and maybe treating his wife like that was harsh, but at the same time I chose to have one kid because I don\u2019t want another one, Steph can\u2019t use my house as a daycare.

Explain to him what happened and that his wife clearly needs some kind of help- whether that\u2019s childcare or mental health.

Cause that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. \n\nTell your brother that next time she gets dropped when nobody\u2019s home is to call the cops.

She probably feels overwhelmed by motherhood and in her desperation she selfishly dumps her older child onto you, as I\u2019m sure the baby might still be breastfeeding. Regardless, she has no right to dump her child on you, especially unannounced or unasked. Poor Alice, her mother can\u2019t handle having a 4 year old and a 7 month old. You did the right thing.", "No, you were not too harsh. Something is going on and the problem needs to be identified and addressed, not avoided by dumping her child on you. This has the feel of PPD or Alice having behavioral challenges with the baby\u2019s arrival or one of the parents resenting Alice for being the odd one out in the happy little family.

A repeated pattern is not allowed.  \n\nShe was fine with her daughter when she was younger in the baby stage.  Now that she is 4 it\u2019s too much for her and she passes the buck off to others.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with daycares and Nannies mind you.  In these cases parents at least are providing for child in some capacity.", "NTA. She will continue to take advantage of you for as long as you allow her to.", "Nta.. if she\u2019s really running errands, she can take her child. \n\nCall away, that child needs to be taken care of properly.", "NTA, she\u2019s obviously not coping but they need to find practical long term solutions like hiring help, or getting her into daycare etc. Dumping their child on you and leaving her in potentially unsafe situations isn\u2019t ok.", "You're definitely NTA. Dropping a kiddo off without a heads up is not on, especially when you've already made it clear as crystal that this isn't something you're up for. You've tried to set boundaries, but it seems your sister-in-law just keeps taking the Mickey out of you. It's fair dinkum that you reached your boiling point.\n\nRegarding going ballistic, well, it's a bit of a grey area. If you just raised your voice, that's understandable given the circumstances. But if it crossed into cursing or really losing your rag, that's a bit more complicated. While it's never ideal to lose your cool, sometimes situations get the better of us, especially when it feels like we're being taken for a ride.\n\nIt's a tough situation with your brother being a top bloke and all, but at the end of the day, this is about setting healthy boundaries. You're not a drop-in daycare, and your sister-in-law needs to cop that on the chin. Hopefully, things will simmer down, and you can all find a way to move forward without any hard feelings. Wishing you all the best, and hoping this situation normalises sooner rather than later.", "Info. Was Alice within hearing distance for any of this?

To be honest I would be even more positive it was an affair if she wasn\u2019t taking her son.", "Absolutely NTA. \"Steph's\" poor planning does not constitute a responsibility for you. And  \"Enzo\" may have \"talked to\" her, but apparently has not effectively communicated.", "NTA. Please call CPS next time. Otherwise they will roll over you.", "NTA. Call CPS now. Why wait. It's not like they'll just roll up at a moment's notice when you call.", "Is her son a handful or a good kid? Do you think she is cheating on him?

Baby can't leak the secret but a 4 year old would have difficulty hiding that.", "It\u2019s an ESH for me\n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from because that\u2019s got to be really really annoying. I guess the problem I\u2019m having here is why not just talk to Steph? You were relying on your brother to do that but you could have sat her down and had a civil conversation. \n\nNow I know people will argue that she wasn\u2019t being respectful of you so why should you be respectful of her, but maybe if you had this nonsense would have stopped. Or maybe she would have explained why she was doing this. And then you could have told her to stop, or come up with a solution together or something.

No water bottle, no snack, no toy, and no way to find the potty. OP, straighten this out NOW.", "NTA. \nIf she wants help with Alice, she needs to go to the dad (unless he is unstable or anything like that). \nYou are right though, she is neglectful. You can\u2019t take your toddler and just leave them in a lobby. I\u2019m surprised someone working there hadn\u2019t already called on her.", "NTA. Do it!", "NTA. Sounds like she needed a stern talking to in order to get it through her head that you\u2019re not her kid\u2019s babysitter. Maybe things would have gone divergent if she asked you upfront about watching her kid and you could have made a set schedule for those times if you agreed. But the way she has handled it is awful.", "NTA.\n\nshe is:\n\n1. being inconsiderate of you by not respecting you boundaries\n2. being irresponsible by not checking with you if you are available\n3. actually neglecting her child, knowingly leaving her in your house when you are not there.\n4. showing favouritism towards the new baby - she is always with him while she keeps throwing her older daughter at you.\n\nMaybe CPS getting involved is the wake up call Steph needs to become a better mother to her children", "NTA", "She\u2019s leaving her with your concierge, a stranger to her, and expecting them to watch her daughter? That is so so scary\u2026 for everyone. Concierge included.", "She doesn't call and ask first????? That's insane \ud83d\ude33", "Your reaction was warranted. Steph needed a reality check about respecting your space and boundaries.", "NTA\n\nIt honestly isn't really safe or legal for you to knowingly let her regularly abandon her kid \"with you\" when no one is really there to take care of the small child. It is possible that someone might also find that you, too, were guilty of neglect. When she figures out that CPS will be called every time she abandons her kid in the lobby she will probably very quickly stop doing that.", "Definitely NTA", "NTA. Not harsh at all. Steph has been very irresponsible here. This seems to be a constant issue so it needs sorting out.", "NTA. I suggest you ask your housekeeper to not open the door if it is Steph.   And if Steph just leave Alice at the doorstep, then housekeeper or you can call the police.", "NTA. Does she not have a cell phone? If she made sure you were always home I would still think you did the right thing but there would be some wiggle room for guilt, but she didn\u2019t. There have been times she has left her child in your lobby or at your door when you weren\u2019t there. That is abandoning a child. She isn\u2019t leaving her with you for babysitting, she is leaving her in a building in hopes of maybe you being there and babysitting. That is not safe. \n\nReach out to Enzo and ask him to make her MAKE her go through rigorous testing for post partum depression just to see if she is actually overwhelmed and if so get help for both children, and her. But it sounds like she is having some girls time or mommy and me baby classes and needs some consequences for those actions. Poor Alice, she has to feel like her mommy doesn\u2019t want her around.", "NTA - And let the building manager know they can call the cops to have her trespassed if she shows her face again.  They will pull in CPS for the child abandonment.", "You did what was necessary to protect your boundaries. Steph's actions were unacceptable, and you needed to stand your ground.", "Are Alice and your daughter not friends? What do they do with their son?", "NTA.  She left you only 2 choices: continue making your housekeeper or deal with her like this.\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t so bad, I\u2019d ask if you could do something like offer to pay for a sitter once every week or two if the issue on her side is finances (since you\u2019re well off enough to apparently have a full time housekeeper), but I think she\u2019d start doing the same thing to the sitter.", "NTA\n\nLong overdue.\n\nAnd send them a bill for whatever you paid to your housekeeper during the hours she was babysitting and not housekeeping.", "NTA but something is really wrong here between these two children and their treatment by their mother.\n\nYour brother needs to get a handle on his household. Children are in danger and something is going on.", "Nta\n\nI'm surprised the concierge didn't call the police for an abandoned child", "NTA for saying that to your SIL, but YTA for saying all that in the presence of Alice.", "NTA\n\nYou said your sil said she only drops alice over if she is desperate.  But you recently returned home to find alice there because she had 1/2 day of school.  Your SIL had to have known in advance it was a 1/2 day at school, so it wasn't an emergency and not a desperate need for a babysitter.  she also had to have had alice with her to get her to your place, so why not just take her home?\n\nI think your SIL is doing something sketchy that she doesnt want a child who can talk to be with her.  On the 1/2 day Alice was dropped off hrs before you returned from lunch and your sister didnt show up until several hrs later.  Thats 4 or 5 hrs and i cant imagine what would take that much time that is an emergency (since sil said she only drops alice off when shes desperate).\n\nDid you ask her what she was doing that required 4-5 hrs without her child?  The fact that she doesn't say where she is is another \ud83d\udea9.\n\nMaybe you need to share how frequently this happens with Enzo.", "NTA you should have called a Long Time ago", "YTA- try being a better person", "NTA. Do it! Steph is not entitled to your free services as a day care. I also think it is kind of sus. Where is the other child during this, and why does she feel the need to get rid of Alice so often?", "NTA. She may also flat out need to be told that you did not hire your housekeeper to watch her child. How unfair for her to be infringed on like that. Have you told her directly she is free to tell SIL that she is not babysitting/it's not what she's hired to do?", "NTA. And she is not even leaving her with you sometime s, she is leaving her with your housekeeper and with the building concierge, unattended in the lobby...", "NTA. Steph is either cheating or into some shady stuff", "I hope she isnt trying to get rid of the older child, now that she has a shiny new baby and a partner who is sticking arou d/capable of caring for her and the kid. \n\nSomeone needs to talk to the kid and make sure she isnt being neglected now that the mom has a new baby she prefers.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL is making her poor planning your problem. I think the threat of calling social services should make her understand you\u2019re serious. Your brother must put a stop to this. What a mess. I also hope it never comes to calling. Once they\u2019re involved things can easily snowball.", "> Enzo has never been anything but the most accommodating person\n\nYeah, uh, no. He apologises and says he's 'talked to her'. Sounds very wishy-washy and much like an excuse for him to stay on your good side enough that you'll keep taking care of Alice because _he_ at least is just _so nice._ He's basically doing the equivalent of throwing his hands up in the air and saying \"welp, I tried! Not my fault!\" then dusting his hands of the situation and leaving. If he actually wanted to help you, he'd discuss such options with her such as getting their own nanny or sitter, and be more pro-active about giving her consequences for her actions.\n\nIf she does drop Alice off, call the police on the non-emergency number. Or have the concierge or housekeeper do it if you're not home. NTA", "Absolutely not too harsh. Your home is not a daycare, and Steph needed to understand and respect your boundaries", "NTA. You have warned her that you will call social services, so do it. People can only take advantage of you if you let them.", "NTA. Unsafe situation for the child.", "Maybe I've been on reddit too long, but I get the feeling that her \"errands\" are a cover for male company.\n\nNTA. I work in a public library and parents often drop their young children off and leave to run errands and even go to work. You would not believe the types of people that come through our doors, and staff are not equipped to keep an eye on every minor in the building. It is basically the equivalent of leaving your child in a public park.\n\nWe call the cops if the parent doesn't come back to pick up their kid or answer the phone, because the safety of the child is always first. You have said yourself that you are often not at home when Alice is dropped off. What if your housekeeper had an emergency and had to leave early? What if the concierge was back-filled by someone else that day, and was a stickler for rules and had no experience with kids, and instead made her stay in the foyer while they helped someone else instead of watching her?\n\nThese might seem like far-fetched scenarios, but if no one has agreed to take responsibility for a child, then <i>no one has taken responsibility for the child.</i> Kids always come first.

They know we are trying to deal with it", "steph can try being a better damn mom. you don't just dump your kid on someone else, especially someone you never once even asked to look after said kid!", "For what? Being worried that a preschool-aged child is repeatedly getting abandoned to sit alone in an apartment complex lobby until a family member who doesn\u2019t have the time or energy to care for them can come get the child?", "She takes Teddy everywhere with her. At least I presume she does because she always has him when she collects Alice", "Who is Alice screwing?", "It's because you can just carry a baby around, making occasional noises at it and change it, but you have to actually interact and engage with a 4 year old and pay attention to them.", "I have many times, but she\u2019s just the sweetest woman. She sees a child at the door she doesn\u2019t have the heart to just leave her outside or call social services. She knows we\u2019d support her if she just straight up refused to take Alice but she\u2019s too nice", "Well I know he is talking to her, because Steph has previously made comments about me \u201cgetting her in trouble\u201d with him over it. Clearly he isn\u2019t doing enough but then, I get where he\u2019s coming from because all of us have told her to stop doing this. Idc whether he hires her help, that\u2019s not the point the point is that my household isn\u2019t the help.", "Honestly, it\u2019s a bit more obvious than that. My husband often runs his business from home and we have many men going in and out of the house on those days. All of whom I\u2019ve known a long time, whom I trust and I trust my husband\u2019s judgement, and there is a schedule and rules around them being around our daughter. But Steph doesn\u2019t know these men. She just leaves her kid there knowing there\u2019s adult men going in and out of the house with no concern for who these people are. It\u2019s bizarre to me.", "I think calling CPS is extreme. They could lose the child", "You should seriously call CPS. What happens when she finds another \"free babysitter\" and they start letting the wrong people into her home while Alice is there?", "Now that i think about it, what does she do with the baby if she leave her daughter with you ?!", "Oh no..", "You cannot worry about that. Alice has bigger problems, and it\u2019s her mother\u2019s job to protect from scenarios like this. Not yours.", "I know.", "So it sounds like she either doesn't like Alice or is really very tired. Regardless, it's not your responsibility, nor anyone else's in your building. Tell her you may agree to babysit Alice *sometimes* but only if it's arranged beforehand and you know when to expect her.", "Hire a private investigator!", "Does she say why she can\u2019t manage?", "Tell them to call police", "Um, Alice is the child.", "Hopefully nobody.  She's four years old.  Steph, on the other hand, probably has a parade of men coming in her place, so she needs to warehouse Alice somewhere because while the baby can't rat her out, a toddler can.", "There\u2019s this thing called \u201creading comprehension\u201d\n\nYou should give it a try", "Imagine having to interact with your child. Horrendous!", "Have you sent Steph the invoice for what she owes the housekeeper yet?", "What kind of \"trouble\" has she been in with Enzo? It can't be too much if she keeps doing it.\n\nTell Enzo how often this happens, and let him know that if this happens again you'll have no other option than to go to CPS over this. What she is doing is illegal and unsafe for the child, and it literally IS child abandonment. \n\nLet me ask you an important question: What if your housekeeper or the concierge ended up not being good people?? What would happen if someone walked into lobby claiming to be your friend?? \n\nYou've gotten lucky so far, but honestly Alice could very easily run away or get hurt trying to stay at your place. If you're not home because you don't know she's even there, what happens to Alice when something bad happens?? \n\nReporting her to CPS isn't to stop her from dropping off Alice. You're doing it to keep Alice safe, which Steph seems to not really care about.", "> Idc whether he hires her help, that\u2019s not the point the point is that my household isn\u2019t the help.\n\nI realise that. And I agree. It's their issue to work out without involving you.", "That is...even worse than when the two adults in the scenario (besides you) were just the housekeeper and the concierge. Absolutely NTA. I can't even with that scenario! Does she have no maternal protective instincts at all??", "Then maybe, just fuckin maybe, Alice\u2019s mother should stop abandoning the kid. \n\nThis isn\u2019t rocket surgery. If Alice\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t want to lose her kids she needs to step up and do her job as parent", "Their responsibility. And they neglect the child, so\u2026", "Well I don\u2019t know where she\u2019d leave Alice if not with us. She doesn\u2019t seem to know anyone in the area. Maybe she\u2019d leave Alice at a school friend\u2019s house, but I do wonder if that\u2019s not what she\u2019s doing on the days Alice doesn\u2019t end up with us", "I presume she takes him with her because he\u2019s always with her when she arrives to collect Alice. And he\u2019s still breastfeeding so idk where she could leave him", "I\u2019m not spending money on a relationship that\u2019s not mine. If Enzo has suspicions she\u2019s having an affair he needs to sort that out himself", "She has \u201cso much to do\u201d, \u201cTeddy is colicky and she hasn\u2019t slept and she just can\u2019t handle both kids right now\u201d, she hasn\u2019t \u201chad a break in a week\u201d, she\u2019s exhausted, she had a doctor\u2019s appointment and Alice can\u2019t deal with the waiting around. There\u2019s always some excuse and while I try not to judge because I\u2019ve only got the one kid, it really does sound like she\u2019s just saying \u201cI can\u2019t parent right now because I\u2019ve been parenting and I\u2019m tired\u201d", "Ohh good idea", "No one except the affair partner. Alice can talk, the infant can't.", "She is being completely irresponsible and you shouldn't have to deal with this. Put a tile tracker on her car?", "Well she doesn\u2019t work so you would think if she was having an affair she\u2019d conduct those activities while Alice is at school to prevent this nonsense", "I\u2019m pretty sure Enzo has trackers on their cars, given our father was a security paranoid person and we both take after him. But I will check with him", "There's nothing here suggesting that this woman thinks at all.", "Fair point"]}
