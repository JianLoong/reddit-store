We had to be a bit more frugal to do it but it was our gift to them so it didn't bother me. Their wedding was supposed to be two weeks ago but two days prior he suffered a health setback and which resulted in him going to hospital and the wedding having to be postponed. That mean everything had to be canceled- most of which wasn't refundable. Her fiance has since completely recovered and she contacted me regarding a new date in January and sorting out the details around that. I don't think it has to be said but to be clear I completely understand that this was unforseen and a very stressful time for the both of them. I'm very happy that he has recovered and do want them to have the wedding they dreamed of because they do deserve it. However the amount of money that went down the drain after the postponement is insane especially in this financial climate. Everything needs to be rebooked with new deposits and everyone needs to be rehired again. Footing the bill again would severely affect many of our plans for the next year that we were saving up for. I told her this and she's not too happy to say the least. She's very disappointed and things have been icy because they would have to put off getting a house together if they were to pay for the wedding and they still wouldn't be able to afford the wedding that they want. \n\nThis has been on my head for the past while so I wanted to know am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1670449488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfeygl/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_daughters_wedding/", "score": 964, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She didn\u2019t have to have an expensive wedding to begin with. It blows my mind that she\u2019s complaining about not getting the wedding she wanted knowing that you were already stretching things as it was and that you\u2019ve lost a lot of money because of the setback. She should be grateful that you paid for what you did and that her fianc\u00e9 is healthy and just go for a simple ceremony and keep the rest for the house.", "NTA.  She should have gotten wedding insurance . It\u2019s awful that he had a health problem but you simply can\u2019t afford to pay for two weddings, especially back to back like this.  She is going to have to make concessions", "NTA\n\nThe situation sucks but it is what it is. \n\nTell your daughter to start reaching out to the vendors. They will generally work with you on a ppostponed wedding especially for a medical emergency, such as giving her half the value as credit towards future services. She might have to have a more modest wedding and/or shell out a bit more herself, but I\u2019m certain she can get partway there with some of most of the vendors.", "NTA. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the wedding had to be postponed, but I would have hoped that a health scare would highlight that the important thing is the marriage, not the wedding. Its understandable that she would be disappointed that she didn\u2019t get her dream day, but it\u2019s not reasonable for her to ask you to pay for everything all over again and get annoyed that you aren\u2019t able to. \n\nI guess this might be the kind of situation that wedding insurance was intended for.", "NTA. You already paid for one wedding. It is not anyone's fault it had to be postponed due to a health situation. They can not reasonably expect you to pay for another one.", "Obviously NTA.\n\nJust be honest with your daughter and say you can't afford to essentially pay for 2 weddings. You are happy to put any money you got back from the deposits you could collect though. She is gonna have to get comfortable with a cheaper wedding. That's life, shit happens.\n\nIf she is still mad, she's an asshole, which sucks for you but you don't need to feel any guilt over the wedding costs. You already were insanely generous to pay for it to begin with.", "nah, the postponing was no ones fault, i understand she still wants the wedding, but you can't pay it twice ( i am asuming you are not a multi miljonair, if you are jeff bezos, just pay) \n\nFair would be giving her all you could get refunded, maybe check if aditional refunds can be had ( or if cancalled vendors are willing to offer a huge discount) and give her that.

You can pitch in how you are comfortable, they cand downsize their wedding dreams?\n\nWeddings are one day. \n\nI was a wedding photographer for about 5 years.

The weddings I got paid $500 we're more memorable and amazing than the weddings I was paid $5,000. \n\nThey can still have a beautiful wedding without such a hefty price.", "NTA. You mustn't put yourself into financial distress for your daughter's wedding.", "NTA. You can't be expected to pay twice.", "NTA.

But I agree that throwing more deposits and costs would be prohibitive.\n\nMaybe offer to provide a cash gift towards a home deposit instead? Personally, weddings tend to be a lot of money for a single day, versus investing for the future.", "NTA - that sucks really bad, but money doesn't grow on trees and you can't magically make more appear.  That said, has anyone tried working with the vendors yet on reusing deposits?  Have you looked at any of your contracts to see what your cancellation/refund clauses look like?  That was a serious medical emergency and many folks may work with you.", "NTA. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. I\u2019m surprised most of the vendors djdnt work with her  to rebook instead of straight cancel. Regardless, paying for a wedding twice isn\u2019t financially feasible.

It\u2019s unfortunate that they can\u2019t afford both, but being an adult is making realistic and responsible choices.", "NAH. You paid once, the money wasn't recoverable. It wasn't his fault that he got sick. Sometimes life just sucks. You can only pay what you can afford to and doubling your expenditure on their wedding is understandably not something you budgeted for, and not something they did either.", "NAH.

It isn't anybody's fault.", "NTA you've already paid once.\nBUT \nYou seem to be such a loving parent and your daughter seems nice it's okay for her to feel disappointed that her dream wedding is not gonna happen especially when it was ruined and postponed for such reason, i think you would make her beyond happy if you helped her again even with a small amount, i would honestly give my whole entire world for the sake of my kid's happiness and I believe you would do the same.\nAny vacation/plan whatever you wanted to do with the money wouldn't be as important as the happiness of your kid as long as your kid is grateful and appreciative ofc.", "OP, You shouldn't have to pay for the wedding twice.

You should give them the money for the wedding in cash minus whatever you lost due to the postponement. Let them figure it out from there. \n\nI think expensive weddings are ridiculous. Half the time, people don\u2019t even know what a marriage is and wind up divorcing in five or 10 years.\n\nSorry to say; but your daughter sounds like she will be in that group, given her entitled and immature attitude.", "NTA: They will be disappointed, but in time they will understand.", "NTA they need to realize the situation has now changed and you can not put all that money into it again. I\u2019d subtract what was lost and give her the amount left over from original amount. It was an unfortunate thing that happened but sounds like a lot of money was lost. I\u2019d tell her again how much was lost. They need to scale back wedding or come up with more funds themselves. To expect the same amount again to start over is a little crazy.", "NAH\n\nIf any of your budget for the wedding remains, offer to pay that.", "NTA - as long as you and your daughter are communicating here. If you allocated and were expecting to spend X, thats fine. But you cant afford to pay for two weddings.", "NTA\n\nYou're not refusing to pay for the wedding - you're refusing to pay twice.

Not your responsibility to pay in the first place, absolutely not your responsibility to pay twice. \n\nSo now they should act like adults and have a cheap and easy wedding or accept that it will put them back on their other finances.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately that\u2019s life! You don\u2019t have an endless pit of money to spend on the wedding. They\u2019ll just have to make do I\u2019m afraid!", "NTA but neither is your daughter for being disappointed.

It wasn't your fault her fiance got sick right before the day and all the money was lost. Not their fault either. But life happens and she needs to roll with the punches. Your offer was followed through and the money is gone. It's completely entitled for her to expect you to pay again when you never had to pay to begin with and when it will be incredibly difficult (and silly) to afford it for a second chance.

Y'all are acting like she threw a tantrum, she didn't, she's disappointed as anyone would be in this situation, that doesn't make her an asshole, that makes her human. And yeah things are a little icy after your disappointed, that's just how it goes. \n\nThis was a situation that happened, and with the current environment it makes sense that you can't pay what you did before.

You mention this would affect your plans for the next *year*, not five years or ten years, or your retirement.  One year only.

There's nothing good in spending lavishly on a party that gives you one day of happiness and years of misery. People don't see it because they don't look more than a day ahead of their nose.\n\nMarrying the love of your life should be enough and celebrating it with your nearest and dearest should be a bonus. Any extra extravagances should be considered a luxury.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you can't afford it, you can't afford it. Food, housing and heating are more important than a party. We're no longer living in easy times and our expectations regarding luxuries need to adjust with those times.\n\nPlenty of people have managed to have wonderful, memorable weddings that didn't cost the Earth.

She was also a very anxious bride (and person in general), so most of that very expensive day was spent stressing about everything being 'perfect'. Money well spent /s.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband and I opted for a registry office wedding and a buffet dinner at our local Indonesian restaurant for 40 guests. All in all, our day would've cost us less than \u00a33k, but COVID had other plans.

The way OP phrased it, it sounds like they'd have to cancel or scale back a vacation or something, and note that it would only affect their saving for a year.   That's not an ordinary position to be in, with the cost of weddings. \n\nPut it this way, if the daughter's wedding cost $5k total, that would wipe out *years* of savings for me, and put me in a tight bind for something like half a decade at my wages.  Yet according to OP, this would only affect his plans for one year, not beyond that.  Very unusual. \n\n\nIt's highly unlikely her entire wedding is anywhere close to $5k.  So either this wedding is extraordinarily cheap, or OP has an extremely high amount of disposable income each year.   Therefore spending on a second wedding wouldn't hurt them the way it would someone with regular finances.", "The hassle of changing identification info definitely solidified my decision not to change my name when I got married.

You kept your word and paid for their wedding. The extreme waste of money of doing it again is ridiculous and the hardship it would place on your financial position means it should not be undertaken. That your daughter thinks she is mature enough to get married means that she should also be mature enough to take responsibility for herself. She is certainly conscious of the cost as she does not want to undertake it because it would disrupt her own financial position of getting herself a house. But she is okay with your finances taking the hit. Nice daughter you have there.
