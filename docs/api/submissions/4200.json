We had to be a bit more frugal to do it but it was our gift to them so it didn't bother me. Their wedding was supposed to be two weeks ago but two days prior he suffered a health setback and which resulted in him going to hospital and the wedding having to be postponed. That mean everything had to be canceled- most of which wasn't refundable. Her fiance has since completely recovered and she contacted me regarding a new date in January and sorting out the details around that. I don't think it has to be said but to be clear I completely understand that this was unforseen and a very stressful time for the both of them. I'm very happy that he has recovered and do want them to have the wedding they dreamed of because they do deserve it. However the amount of money that went down the drain after the postponement is insane especially in this financial climate. Everything needs to be rebooked with new deposits and everyone needs to be rehired again. Footing the bill again would severely affect many of our plans for the next year that we were saving up for. I told her this and she's not too happy to say the least. She's very disappointed and things have been icy because they would have to put off getting a house together if they were to pay for the wedding and they still wouldn't be able to afford the wedding that they want. \n\nThis has been on my head for the past while so I wanted to know am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1670449488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfeygl/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_daughters_wedding/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She didn\u2019t have to have an expensive wedding to begin with. It blows my mind that she\u2019s complaining about not getting the wedding she wanted knowing that you were already stretching things as it was and that you\u2019ve lost a lot of money because of the setback. She should be grateful that you paid for what you did and that her fianc\u00e9 is healthy and just go for a simple ceremony and keep the rest for the house.", "NTA.  She should have gotten wedding insurance . It\u2019s awful that he had a health problem but you simply can\u2019t afford to pay for two weddings, especially back to back like this.  She is going to have to make concessions", "NTA\n\nThe situation sucks but it is what it is. \n\nTell your daughter to start reaching out to the vendors. They will generally work with you on a ppostponed wedding especially for a medical emergency, such as giving her half the value as credit towards future services. She might have to have a more modest wedding and/or shell out a bit more herself, but I\u2019m certain she can get partway there with some of most of the vendors.", "NTA. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the wedding had to be postponed, but I would have hoped that a health scare would highlight that the important thing is the marriage, not the wedding. Its understandable that she would be disappointed that she didn\u2019t get her dream day, but it\u2019s not reasonable for her to ask you to pay for everything all over again and get annoyed that you aren\u2019t able to. \n\nI guess this might be the kind of situation that wedding insurance was intended for.", "NTA. You already paid for one wedding. It is not anyone's fault it had to be postponed due to a health situation. They can not reasonably expect you to pay for another one.", "Obviously NTA.\n\nJust be honest with your daughter and say you can't afford to essentially pay for 2 weddings. You are happy to put any money you got back from the deposits you could collect though. She is gonna have to get comfortable with a cheaper wedding. That's life, shit happens.\n\nIf she is still mad, she's an asshole, which sucks for you but you don't need to feel any guilt over the wedding costs. You already were insanely generous to pay for it to begin with.", "nah, the postponing was no ones fault, i understand she still wants the wedding, but you can't pay it twice ( i am asuming you are not a multi miljonair, if you are jeff bezos, just pay) \n\nFair would be giving her all you could get refunded, maybe check if aditional refunds can be had ( or if cancalled vendors are willing to offer a huge discount) and give her that. Small weddings can be great too, she can try to work with what she has.", "NTA. \n\nThere must be some middle ground? You can pitch in how you are comfortable, they cand downsize their wedding dreams?\n\nWeddings are one day. \n\nI was a wedding photographer for about 5 years. The most amazing weddings were when I was first starting and budgets were scarce. The weddings I got paid $500 we're more memorable and amazing than the weddings I was paid $5,000. \n\nThey can still have a beautiful wedding without such a hefty price.", "NTA. You mustn't put yourself into financial distress for your daughter's wedding.", "NTA. You can't be expected to pay twice.", "NTA. It's very unfortunate but at the end of the day it is your money and you are not required to pay for their wedding. It was a gift and something generous you decided to do on different circumstances. Now the situation is different and you did pay previously.", "Honestly, NTA.\n\nEmergencies happen and given the hospitalization, they couldn't plan for what happened. But I agree that throwing more deposits and costs would be prohibitive.\n\nMaybe offer to provide a cash gift towards a home deposit instead? Personally, weddings tend to be a lot of money for a single day, versus investing for the future.", "NTA - that sucks really bad, but money doesn't grow on trees and you can't magically make more appear.  That said, has anyone tried working with the vendors yet on reusing deposits?  Have you looked at any of your contracts to see what your cancellation/refund clauses look like?  That was a serious medical emergency and many folks may work with you.", "NTA. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. I\u2019m surprised most of the vendors djdnt work with her  to rebook instead of straight cancel. Regardless, paying for a wedding twice isn\u2019t financially feasible. She will be disappointed but she will get over it.", "NTA - You financially can\u2019t afford another wedding. Your daughter is a grown up who should understand your reasons. \n\nIt was an unfortunate emergency that wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault. Your daughter though should re-evaluate her decisions if a wedding is more important than owning a house. It\u2019s unfortunate that they can\u2019t afford both, but being an adult is making realistic and responsible choices.", "NAH. You paid once, the money wasn't recoverable. It wasn't his fault that he got sick. Sometimes life just sucks. You can only pay what you can afford to and doubling your expenditure on their wedding is understandably not something you budgeted for, and not something they did either.", "NAH.  Hopefully, you can still help out a bit.  It doesn't sound like the wedding will be the big event that they wanted.  It isn't anybody's fault.", "NTA you've already paid once.\nBUT \nYou seem to be such a loving parent and your daughter seems nice it's okay for her to feel disappointed that her dream wedding is not gonna happen especially when it was ruined and postponed for such reason, i think you would make her beyond happy if you helped her again even with a small amount, i would honestly give my whole entire world for the sake of my kid's happiness and I believe you would do the same.\nAny vacation/plan whatever you wanted to do with the money wouldn't be as important as the happiness of your kid as long as your kid is grateful and appreciative ofc.", "OP, You shouldn't have to pay for the wedding twice. If there is any $ you got back from the first wedding, you can offer them that. Othrwise, they will need to figure out something else. It's unfortuante, but this is not on you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You should give them the money for the wedding in cash minus whatever you lost due to the postponement. Let them figure it out from there. \n\nI think expensive weddings are ridiculous. Half the time, people don\u2019t even know what a marriage is and wind up divorcing in five or 10 years.\n\nSorry to say; but your daughter sounds like she will be in that group, given her entitled and immature attitude.", "NTA: They will be disappointed, but in time they will understand.", "NTA they need to realize the situation has now changed and you can not put all that money into it again. I\u2019d subtract what was lost and give her the amount left over from original amount. It was an unfortunate thing that happened but sounds like a lot of money was lost. I\u2019d tell her again how much was lost. They need to scale back wedding or come up with more funds themselves. To expect the same amount again to start over is a little crazy.", "NAH\n\nIf any of your budget for the wedding remains, offer to pay that.", "NTA - as long as you and your daughter are communicating here. If you allocated and were expecting to spend X, thats fine. But you cant afford to pay for two weddings.", "NTA\n\nYou're not refusing to pay for the wedding - you're refusing to pay twice. That's not the same.", "NTA - you agreed to foot the bill for one wedding, which was generous. I'd say you can tell them you'll give them any $$ you manage to recoup.", ">they would have to put off getting a house together if they were to pay for the wedding and they still wouldn't be able to afford the wedding that they want.\n\nIf they can't afford the wedding they want, then they can't have the wedding they can't afford (or the house they can't afford).  \n\nNTA.", "Nta\n\nThey had an emergency, life sucks but that\u2019s how it goes some times. Not your responsibility to pay in the first place, absolutely not your responsibility to pay twice. \n\nSo now they should act like adults and have a cheap and easy wedding or accept that it will put them back on their other finances.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately that\u2019s life! You don\u2019t have an endless pit of money to spend on the wedding. They\u2019ll just have to make do I\u2019m afraid!", "NTA but neither is your daughter for being disappointed. I really hope that this doesn't affect your future relationship with her and your FSIL.", "NTA", "NTA - I\u2019m sure she\u2019s disappointed but a wedding isn\u2019t a necessity, she can get married either way", "NTA you paid for a lot already she couldn\u2019t expect u to pay all over again that\u2019s crazy and her future husband needs to let her know that\u2019s insane. Sounds like a court house wedding would do", "NTA.  You can't afford two weddings and although she must be disappointed, you shouldn't be expected to pay for another one.", "NTA, but maybe you can pay each of them half? She must understand that you can't pay everything again, right?\nWhy were they not insured for cancellation?", "NTA. She should just do a go fund me account. Yes, this was an emergency. However, she should understand that you putting down the wedding funds again is not the right thing. You offered and paid for one wedding. She will need to downside or getting funding somewhere else.", "INFO:\n\nMy judgment is still NTA, but I want to know how you stand financially? You're not obligated to do anything (your promised to pay for 1 wedding and you paid for 1 wedding) but could you afford to help out a fraction of the price of the wedding and they cover the rest?", "NTA. OP, your daughter needs to decide if her marriage is more important than a party. If it's the latter, you might as well start saving up for her divorce because that's inevitably going to happen.", "YTA because you didn't raise her right.  I am sorry but that is the cold hard facts.  She sounds spoiled, unappreciative brat.  I had to pay for my own budgeted wedding.  If I had to do it again, I would even save money on that and put a down payment on a house.  I would just eloped in Vegas to save money.

You tried everything to give her her dream. Stuff happened and now she should downsize. It's the life she will build that matters not the wedding", "NTA. You made the effort and I understand it's disappointing, but if you don't have the funds, you don't have the funds. I certainly feel for your daughter, but no one is at fault here.", "NTA. You were paying for their wedding so that they could spend money in other areas instead. \n\nIt's no one's fault that the postponement had to happen but they will have to save up as your wedding fund has been cleared out now.", "NTA. Tell her you don't have this money. It's not about how much you love her or what you promised. You spent X amount on her wedding (tell her how much exactly!) and simply don't have that kind of money again. It's unfortunate, but that's life.

I don't know what else to tell you but I cannot afford to do it again.

Sometimes life intervenes and things don\u2019t work out. She\u2019ll need to adjust.", "NTA You were stretched far too much paying out the first time. It is wrong of her to assume you can pay out again for a second time.", "This is a great, well-thought-out answer, but daughter sounds like the kind of entitled person for whom \"a more modest wedding\" or \"shelling out a bit more (or anything at all) herself\" isn't an option.", "I was thinking this as well. I think I would just be so grateful my fianc\u00e9 is alive and well I would elope. But I\u2019ve never been one to care for a big, expensive wedding. It\u2019s just a waste to me.", "This is good information, I hope they do this.", "The proper verdict in this case is NAH.", "I'm no Elon musk (not even close) but we do live quite comfortably. I wouldn't be homeless or searching for coins to buy bread if I were to foot the bill again but it would still affect our finances and plans. \n\nEven if it was a fraction because it would have to be a substantial fraction. I hope that answers your question.", "Yep, and they could have a smaller event now and then have a redo of the dream day later on once they are able to pay for it themselves.", "I would at least cover the costs minus the initial down payment had the wedding gone through.  Any less, then you are just looking for an easy reason not to pay.  Even though she sounds like a entitled brat but this is only your story.", "Usually the remainder of the payments are made a week prior to the event so I\u2019m not sure OP lost only the deposits. At least, this is what I had to do for my wedding earlier this year. \n\nThe money for the entire wedding might already be gone and there is nothing left.", "NAH. It seems like you would pay for it if you could reasonably afford to without sacrificing your quality of life. It's also understandable that given everything that's happened, losing the ability to have their dream wedding \"a second time\" so to speak is probably going to take some time for your daughter and her partner to comfortably process.\n\nIdeally she'll take some space and sort through her feelings about everything they've been through, and once she knows what her plan for moving forward is she'll feel ready to reach out and recconnect. At that time, it would probably be a huge step in the right direction to reassure her that you love her and her partner and are so sorry (in the empathy/sympathy way rather than the blame accepting way) you weren't able to make her dream wedding happen, but you hope that she knows you would have if it were something you could reasonably afford. Maybe you could gift her a \"something old\" or \"something new\" for her wedding when it does happen to bring something meaningful representing your love/family to her new plans.", "NTA\n\nIt's unfortunate that things came up and the wedding had to be postponed. With that said, you already held up you end of the bargain. Even though the wedding hadn't happened, you had already paid for everything. \n\nThey may want a nice wedding, but having a home is more important.

This is just one of those situations that stink, but is no one's fault.", "NTA. They want an event or a house? Don't rebuy the wedding. You already paid once.", "NTA.

It isn\u2019t always possible to do over.", "NTA.\n\nI'd advise to forego wedding completely and invest in a downpayment for a house.\n\nThen 5 later they throw a big party to renew their vows and get the party they dreamed of.", "NTA\n\nShit happens.  The money is gone.  That\u2019s a loss to you all, and for her to feel like she\u2019s entitled to another wedding at your expense is a bit disgraceful.\n\nIt will be interested to see how different it will be when they are paying for it instead of you.", "NTA.

Unfortunately the wedding didn't happen", "NTA.", "Obviously NTA\n\nside note: this is why there is wedding insurance\u2026", "You already paid for the wedding and it wasn\u2019t your fault that the original one got cancelled.
