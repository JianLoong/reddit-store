Anyway my BIL's parents live 12 hours away by plane, so they haven't gotten to see them since the baby was born.\n\nI found out that they are going to be flying out to see them in a couple weeks. I thought that was insane, nobody wants to hear a crying infant (their baby cries a lot) for 12 hours on a plane. I told them that this was selfish and inconsiderate of them to subject 200 people to a crying baby for half a day. I mean that's the equivalent of 100 days of people having to be bothered by that.\n\nThey said that his parents can't really travel, and that \"babies cry, people have to deal with it\". I told them that deciding to have unprotected sex doesn't entitle them to disturb an entire plane full of people, and they should wait another few years until the kid is able to behave. I also suggested they should at least do what that Korean mom did, and make some bags with the snacks and earplugs for everyone if they have to deal with that.
