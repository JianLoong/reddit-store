{"id": 30990, "submission_id": "17vg85i", "title": "AITA for saying to my wife that I\u2019m the one who gets to make decisions about my niece?", "selftext": "My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I - it\u2019s a long story, having to do with my sister getting herself pregnant from a deadbeat and proving overall unfit to be a mother. Bottom line is, I see my niece as my daughter and love her just as much as my own biological children (11M/8M). I know my wife also loves her the same way, however I\u2019m legally my niece's sole legal guardian.\n\nMy niece has practiced gymnastics for the past 10 years, and when she was about 7 or 8 one of the coaches at her gym took notice of her potential and suggested she could really make it as a professional athlete. I personally believe my wife and my niece/daughter were taken by this promise of future glory (\u201ccan you imagine if she competes in the Olympics one day?\u201d, my wife said). I was always VERY cautious because I do realize the shots are slim; I also knew that could cost us a lot of money going forward, but the coach believed so much in her that they managed to cover some of the costs of her training on the gym\u2019s dime.\n\nAnd when I say training, I mean TRAINING \u2013 some serious hard work. I told them I was fine with the idea as long my niece was happy doing gymnastics and it didn\u2019t majorly impact her life. And then, last month, she tore her ACL during practice. We do have insurance, so the medical costs were covered. However, she\u2019s going through a painful recovery, all the while wondering when she\u2019ll be healthy enough to get back to the gym. But I told my wife I don\u2019t want her to do this anymore. Seeing her get hurt and in pain made me realize this is a dangerous sport, and the toll it's taking on her body is simply not worth it.\n\nMy wife said I couldn\u2019t make this decision without considering what my niece wants; I said I can because I\u2019m the adult here and she\u2019s still a child. So my wife said there was still the matter of her disagreeing with my view, and that we were supposed to make this parenting decisions together. I then said that's true regarding our boys, but not when it comes to my niece. All I meant is that I'm the sole guardian in the sense of being responsible for her; what my wife got is that I was undermining her as a surrogate mother. AITA here?\n\nEdit: some additional information, to be clear, I still haven't talked to my niece about this. I shared with my wife that, given the severity of her injury, I didn't want her training anymore. This discussion was between my wife and I, it didn't involve our girl so far.", "created_utc": 1700006346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vg85i/aita_for_saying_to_my_wife_that_im_the_one_who/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you pull her out against her will, she will resent you for it. You are so determined to get your own way, you\u2019ve even decided (now it suits you) you are her only parent and the only one who gets a say. Great way to disrespect your wife and disregard every effort she has made to parent her daughter.

You know all sports can be dangerous, even with the helmets right? Are you really going to prevent them from doing sports/activities they love because there is a chance they *could* get hurt? \n\nRegardless of that though I\u2019m gonna have to go with YTA because like others have said, you can\u2019t expect your wife to raise her and not get an equal say.

Also think of the message it will eventually send to your niece about not being your wife\u2019s kids. I am in a similar situation as your wife in terms of raising my partner\u2019s niece who him and his father share  custody of. At this point I have only been in her life for a year so defer to him on many decisions because he knows her better but it\u2019s always a conversation between us and have discussed when in the relationship I would/will take on more say and responsibilities for her. Including when we are married it will be equal. We want her to see herself as part of our nuclear family and make sure she feels like she belongs and is both of our kid especially when we have our own kids we want her to be treated the same as our future children and part of that means me having the same role in her life as I do in my biological children\u2019s", "Well everyone agrees, YTA. Go apologize to your wife and do better.", "YTA. Your niece is old enough to make her own decisions about how she wants to spend her time. Your wife has been by your side helping you raise you. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to just unilaterally decide what your niece does or that your wife has no input just because you\u2019re the only one who signed the papers.

Yes it is a exceptionally hard to be one of the select few that are both in peak form and peak condition (no Injuries) at the right time in the Olympic cycle. So no, she most likely won\u2019t be an Olympian. BUT, firstly, she loves the sport. Secondly, she may very well be good enough to get a college scholarship and compete at the national level. Thirdly, high level gymnasts can have great careers in theatre shows, cirque du Soleil, performing on cruise ships, etc. Depending on her future interests, this is a possible career path. She may even want to coach or open her own gymnastics school. \n\nIs injury possible? Of course. Gymnastics is very hard on the body. But loads of sports run the risk of injury. Skiing, running, cycling, cheerleading, football etc. It happens. But if you take away her sport, something she enjoys and knows she has a proper shot at doing well in, she will resent you forever. You can\u2019t wrap her in cotton wool.", "YTA. \n\n1. Your wife has helped raised your niece up to now. You don't get to pull the \"only I get a say\" card on her now! The time for that was waaaay back at the beginning. You can't pull it out now.\n2. *Your niece is fourteen*! She's old enough to have a say in how she's going to live her life. You don't get to pull the \"only I get a say\" card on *her* either.\n\nAthletes get hurt. It happens. It's not up to you whether that injury is enough for her to quit. It's up to *her*. Lots of athletes think the game is worth injuries.\n\nApologize to your wife for disrespecting your *partnership* with her. For disrespecting all the work and responsibility and care and love she's given your niece all these years.\n\nIf you've got financial concerns, fine. Bring that up in a collaborative way with your *partner* in life. Maybe it's time niece tried for sponsorships or scholarships.\n\nWork with your wife and niece's coach and her doctors to make sure she's taking the best care of herself that she can while practicing and competing. But don't yank the rug out from under her just because you're getting cold feet. Your feet aren't the only ones affected here.", "YTA. Anyone who unilaterally makes decisions without any consideration about how the child feels is an AH.\n\nHave you considered that this is her passion and that she might think the pain and injury is worth it?", "YTA. I\u2019m just imagining this unilateral conversation with a 14-year-old girl whose own thoughts matter so little that you can just \u201cdecide\u201d all the things. Those teenage years are going to be a blast if you don\u2019t rethink your approach with the women in your life.", "YTA\n\nWhile she has no legal standing, she's there everyday being a parent. Trust me, it'll go a long way to seek consensus her.", "YTA. \n\nYou can't expect your wife to raise this child and then not have a say in how she is raised or pull the \"I get to make all of the decisions\" card whenever it suits you. You were dismissive of both your wife and your niece. \n\nAnd in the end, the most important opinion is that of your niece. Does SHE want to recover and try to continue? Does she want to stop? She is 14, taking away something she loves because she might get or did get hurt is not the proper way to go about this.", "ESH, she's your wife and the mother figure for your 6 don't get to just say you're the only opinion to take into consideration put the 2 adults. Your wife too, she needs to understand that tearing an ACL is a huge injury, I had a friend who tore his during soccer and he can't bend his knee as it used to anymore, he can't play soccer anymore and not even just because of the injury but now he's scared he'll do it again and set him back another year of covery.", "YTA - \n\nTo your wife: for downplaying her importance in your daughters (niece) life. She can take care and love her, but technically you can only make important decisions, because of a legal title in name only.\n\nTo your daughter (niece): she\u2019s 14, she should make the decision. Your feelings shouldn\u2019t stop her from trying to achieve her goals (unless detrimental to her life). All sports have a risk of injury and anyone who competes know this.", "You're an absolute AH.\n\nSo your wife will raise that child, pour into this child her life, youth and resources, all the nerve-wracking regarding raising her but when it's about supporting this girl to keep working on her dreams, she's not responsible anymore and only you have a say.\n\nYou do have audacity, I'll give you that.", "AH like how is this even happening .... You and your wife care for her and it's also her life you can't just up and take it away. No you are married you are a team anything big is between you both!

This can\u2019t just be a self contained issue when you tell her, her opinion doesn\u2019t matter. Wait and talk to your niece and her doctor and coach. It sounds like you\u2019re making a snap decision because you are scared.", "YTA, don\u2019t be a dictator with a teenager, ever. It\u2019s up to her to figure out what she wants, you as the adult should support it.", "YTA. Injuries will happen in sports. Some are worse than others, but they\u2019re kind of inevitable. If your niece enjoys doing gymnastics, if that\u2019s her passion, she should have the right to choose whether she wants to continue.\n\nIf you\u2019re really THAT concerned, you and your wife can ask a doctor for their opinion, but you don\u2019t have the right to just veto both your wife and your niece without considering either of their thoughts on the matter.\n\nPersonally, I admire your nieces grit and determination. And I think you should be encouraging of whatever she chooses.", "Your wife is right - your nieces desires about her chosen sport need to be taken into account here. Does your wife help with your niece during her recovery and beforehand, getting her to and from gymnastics, or are you doing all that, seeing as you are the one making all of the decisions?\n\nPeople are injured in sports all the time - she's not some doll you can put on the shelf because she tore her ACL. She could tear her ACL falling off the footpath.", "YTA. Despite you being recognised as her sole guardian, she's raised by BOTH of you.

Or if your wife stopped doing anything for your niece/ daughter because she doesn\u2019t have \u201cofficial\u201d rights. That was a real low blow. I guess she\u2019s good enough when it\u2019s convenient for you that she act as an official mother and they don\u2019t have to call you for every little thing.

Niece gets to say what SHE wants. And your wife is right. Suck it up and apologise to both.", "yta", "You are absolutely YTA \u2026 first you are not taking your niece\u2019s wants into consideration. You say as long as she\u2019s happy and she wants to continue but your scared. Injuries happen to all athletes and that doesn\u2019t stop them. If she loves it how can you take that away from her. That makes you a bad dad since you don\u2019t actually care what your niece wants. \n\nSecond you undermine your wife who has done just as much for your niece and considers her a daughter. That makes you a jackass since you are fine having your wife help raise her but she can\u2019t make any decisions in regards to her. That\u2019s BS \n\nBe a better dad and husband", "YTA,so she\u2019s your equal partner in raising your niece until she disagrees with you.", "You seem to think your wife is also a child and not a partner.

If you expect to make all the decisions regarding your niece, then you shouldn't expect your wife to take on the responsibilities of caring for her either. I hope none of your wife's money goes toward your niece and you do 100% of the cooking, cleaning, chauffeuring and nurturing. Otherwise, you're asking your wife to take on the labor of caregiving but none of the authority.", "You're not wrong, Walter.", "YTA. Even though you are legally the guardian, you are both effectively her parents. There is no good that comes from making unilateral decisions without the other parent. Since she's a teenager, she should also have a say as to whether she wants to continue. \n\nShe enjoys gymnastics and it is a healthy outlet for teenage energy. If you take that away from her without giving her a choice, you're setting yourself up for a lot of problems - possible depression, hanging with the wrong people, having too much time on her hands to do less healthy activities, etc. No sport is without risk, but the benefits generally far outweigh them. It could even potentially get her a college scholarship if she's that good. I highly encourage you to re-think your stance. When gymnastics was taken from me without my choice, I fell into a depression and got into some pretty hard drugs to numb my feelings (which were not taken into account).", "YTA YTA YTA - You really need to make this decision with your niece, not for your niece. Injuries are a risk in ANY sport.\n\nYou take this away from her and she will resent you **forever**. This will not be something she ever forgives you for. And she would be right. This is an super important aspect to her life and you want to take it away because of how YOU *feel* and no other reason.\n\n>My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I\n\nThen she gets an effing say. You are being a HUGE jerk for picking and choosing when she is allowed to parent.

Don't be surprised when your wife steps back and your niece blames you for crushing her dreams. \n\nYou have changed your families dynamics and now you must live with the result. You really are an arse by making such demands of them both", "YTA.\n\nYou seem to be suffering from what i call king of the hill syndrome. Where you think you're the king of the castle and everyone is supposed to fall in line.", "Yta. You don't get to ask her to raise this girl and then not let her have equal say in parenting decisions. The fact that you would try suggests you suck in general.\n\nBeyond that. An ACL injury while painful can happen in literally any sport. It happens in basketball, tennis, running. It happens to people just walking down the street. Yes, gymnastics puts more strain on the joints and ligaments than some sports but injury is part of most any sport. Anyone who plays long enough will experience some. The overall health benefits are worth it for most. Your niece is old enough that if she wants to continue she should be able to do so.", "Yta I bet if this was a son with football, it'd be a different story.    And it's the exact same as your sons. Your wife is *raising* her niece.  Unless you do 100% of the parenting and use no joint money, then she has just as much input as you do.\n\n*Neither* of you, however, has as much input as the neice herself. It's *her* life, not yours.  She may not be able to do gymnastics anymore. She may have tk transition to floor routines.  It's her choice.  You can guide.  You can offer your opinion. You can bring in her coaches and former gymnastics to talk to her.", "Yep, YTA.  When your wife makes dinner do you stop her from making dinner for your niece because it is your responsibility?  When she offers to take her to practice do you stop her and tell her that you will do it since it is your sole responsibility as sole guardian?  When she needs help with homework, or relationship advice, or female hygiene issues are you prepared to tackle all of those issues on your own as sole guardian?  If not, shut your freaking mouth and give your wife the respect she deserves for taking in your niece along with you.  She deserves that much.  YTA", "Gentle YTA. I don't think 'I'm the sole legal guardian' goes all that far when, in every other circumstance, you do indeed treat your wife like your partner in raising our children (including your niece) and naturally expect her to treat your niece like her daughter. This is not a distinction you want to make if you can avoid it. What your wife is saying has merit - you should not withdraw your niece from the sport without her (your niece) being on board, as she will initially at least feel that she's being unfairly punished and will resent you.\n\nThe obvious answer here is to talk to them both. Yes, you have ultimate decision-making authority in the eyes of the law or whatnot, but the good parenting decision is to talk through your concerns with your niece and your wife. And I agree they should not be too influenced by the possibility of olympics some day - her long-term health (in my eyes at least) is more important. Maybe continuing in gymnastics WITHOUT the rigorous training associated with the goal of being an olympian is the path.", "YTA\n\nMarriage is a partnership. It is not a 'partnership when it's convenient for you'.", "If niece had Olympic potential then at 14 she would already be on her way. So that's not going to happen.\n\nYTA for what you said to your wife. I hope she stops doing all the chores involved in raising your niece for you.", "YTA.  The 14yo gets a voice.  It\u2019s got to be her choice.  Damn, this is parenting 101.  You \u201cdecide\u201d she\u2019s done and you will have destroyed the relationship forever.", "YTA. \n\nFirst sentence: my niece is being raised by my wife and I. \n\nOverall message: I am my nieces guardian and get to make all decisions on her behalf. \n\nThese two do not work together. Excluding a 14 year old from their own life choices also doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m sure you mean well, but these are not your decisions to make by yourself. Don\u2019t alienate your family to keep control", "YTA. Your wife should have just as much a say in decisions regarding the niece as you do.\n\nThat being said, time for all 3 of you to consult with sport professionals (not just some coach at some gym who sees potential): professionals who can give real insight into coming back from this type of injury, professionals who can evaluate her potential, etc. Unilaterally just deciding she can't go back to a sport she loves? AH", "YTA. If you\u2019ve been making all the decisions up until now, taking her to every practice and making every meal and packing her gym bag? Yeah, you might then have some kind of shitty right to make all of the decisions all by your ownself. But if your wife has shared equally in the parenting of that child? Well, you\u2019ve really screwed up.", "Info:  Wht doesn't your wife have any legal custody of your niece?  Whose decision was that?", "Soft YTA in that she is a surrogate mom. I do agree with you in that as adults, you get the final say. Though you should consider her wants, if you think the sport is too dangerous, it's okay to make her quit.

It really is a dangerous sport.\n\nMy child retired because of a serious injury and it was a blow, but looking back, they don't regret it one bit. It was the right time to quit.", "YTA. This is all about YOUR feelings. Not your niece\u2019s.

I've been doing it for over 10 years, with no major issues. On the other hand I know people who have hurt themselves very badly, not just lifting but also playing soccer, baseball, hockey, volleyball etc. You can't protect your kids from everything. Follow the advice from professionals on the healing process/returning to gymnastics, but if she wants to keep going she should.", "Well said on all counts and agree with everything and I especially agree on the teenage stance that when something that important is taken away the kid spirals into the bad shit, wrong crowd, defiant attitude worse than normal teenage attitude.

It is a contact sport and concussions are a regular occurrence.", "Have you ever skied? ACL tears are common at any level.", "21% of high school football players get CTE, pretty much all sports can lead to catastrophic injuries no matter what level you train at. \n\nYour whole family could die anytime you guys get into a car, are you going to let that fear dictate whether or not you guys walk everywhere instead of taking a vehicle? Then why let it dictate whether or not your niece can do something she *thrives* at? Instead of drawing a line and saying hard no she can\u2019t do it anymore, you should have opened a discussion to maybe taking it a little more easy with the training.
