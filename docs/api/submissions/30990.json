{"id": 30990, "submission_id": "17vg85i", "title": "AITA for saying to my wife that I\u2019m the one who gets to make decisions about my niece?", "selftext": "My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I - it\u2019s a long story, having to do with my sister getting herself pregnant from a deadbeat and proving overall unfit to be a mother. Bottom line is, I see my niece as my daughter and love her just as much as my own biological children (11M/8M). I know my wife also loves her the same way, however I\u2019m legally my niece's sole legal guardian.\n\nMy niece has practiced gymnastics for the past 10 years, and when she was about 7 or 8 one of the coaches at her gym took notice of her potential and suggested she could really make it as a professional athlete. I personally believe my wife and my niece/daughter were taken by this promise of future glory (\u201ccan you imagine if she competes in the Olympics one day?\u201d, my wife said). I was always VERY cautious because I do realize the shots are slim; I also knew that could cost us a lot of money going forward, but the coach believed so much in her that they managed to cover some of the costs of her training on the gym\u2019s dime.\n\nAnd when I say training, I mean TRAINING \u2013 some serious hard work. I told them I was fine with the idea as long my niece was happy doing gymnastics and it didn\u2019t majorly impact her life. And then, last month, she tore her ACL during practice. We do have insurance, so the medical costs were covered. However, she\u2019s going through a painful recovery, all the while wondering when she\u2019ll be healthy enough to get back to the gym. But I told my wife I don\u2019t want her to do this anymore. Seeing her get hurt and in pain made me realize this is a dangerous sport, and the toll it's taking on her body is simply not worth it.\n\nMy wife said I couldn\u2019t make this decision without considering what my niece wants; I said I can because I\u2019m the adult here and she\u2019s still a child. So my wife said there was still the matter of her disagreeing with my view, and that we were supposed to make this parenting decisions together. I then said that's true regarding our boys, but not when it comes to my niece. All I meant is that I'm the sole guardian in the sense of being responsible for her; what my wife got is that I was undermining her as a surrogate mother. AITA here?\n\nEdit: some additional information, to be clear, I still haven't talked to my niece about this. I shared with my wife that, given the severity of her injury, I didn't want her training anymore. This discussion was between my wife and I, it didn't involve our girl so far.", "created_utc": 1700006346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vg85i/aita_for_saying_to_my_wife_that_im_the_one_who/", "score": 1723, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you pull her out against her will, she will resent you for it. You are so determined to get your own way, you\u2019ve even decided (now it suits you) you are her only parent and the only one who gets a say.

You know all sports can be dangerous, even with the helmets right? Are you really going to prevent them from doing sports/activities they love because there is a chance they *could* get hurt? \n\nRegardless of that though I\u2019m gonna have to go with YTA because like others have said, you can\u2019t expect your wife to raise her and not get an equal say.

Also think of the message it will eventually send to your niece about not being your wife\u2019s kids. I am in a similar situation as your wife in terms of raising my partner\u2019s niece who him and his father share  custody of. At this point I have only been in her life for a year so defer to him on many decisions because he knows her better but it\u2019s always a conversation between us and have discussed when in the relationship I would/will take on more say and responsibilities for her. Including when we are married it will be equal. We want her to see herself as part of our nuclear family and make sure she feels like she belongs and is both of our kid especially when we have our own kids we want her to be treated the same as our future children and part of that means me having the same role in her life as I do in my biological children\u2019s", "Well everyone agrees, YTA.

Yes it is a exceptionally hard to be one of the select few that are both in peak form and peak condition (no Injuries) at the right time in the Olympic cycle. So no, she most likely won\u2019t be an Olympian. BUT, firstly, she loves the sport. Secondly, she may very well be good enough to get a college scholarship and compete at the national level. Thirdly, high level gymnasts can have great careers in theatre shows, cirque du Soleil, performing on cruise ships, etc. Depending on her future interests, this is a possible career path. She may even want to coach or open her own gymnastics school. \n\nIs injury possible? Of course. Gymnastics is very hard on the body. But loads of sports run the risk of injury. Skiing, running, cycling, cheerleading, football etc. It happens. But if you take away her sport, something she enjoys and knows she has a proper shot at doing well in, she will resent you forever. You can\u2019t wrap her in cotton wool.", "YTA. \n\n1. Your wife has helped raised your niece up to now. You don't get to pull the \"only I get a say\" card on her now! The time for that was waaaay back at the beginning. You can't pull it out now.\n2. *Your niece is fourteen*! She's old enough to have a say in how she's going to live her life. You don't get to pull the \"only I get a say\" card on *her* either.\n\nAthletes get hurt. It happens. It's not up to you whether that injury is enough for her to quit. It's up to *her*. Lots of athletes think the game is worth injuries.\n\nApologize to your wife for disrespecting your *partnership* with her. For disrespecting all the work and responsibility and care and love she's given your niece all these years.\n\nIf you've got financial concerns, fine. Bring that up in a collaborative way with your *partner* in life. Maybe it's time niece tried for sponsorships or scholarships.\n\nWork with your wife and niece's coach and her doctors to make sure she's taking the best care of herself that she can while practicing and competing.

Anyone who unilaterally makes decisions without any consideration about how the child feels is an AH.\n\nHave you considered that this is her passion and that she might think the pain and injury is worth it?", "YTA. I\u2019m just imagining this unilateral conversation with a 14-year-old girl whose own thoughts matter so little that you can just \u201cdecide\u201d all the things. Those teenage years are going to be a blast if you don\u2019t rethink your approach with the women in your life.", "YTA\n\nWhile she has no legal standing, she's there everyday being a parent. Trust me, it'll go a long way to seek consensus her.", "YTA. \n\nYou can't expect your wife to raise this child and then not have a say in how she is raised or pull the \"I get to make all of the decisions\" card whenever it suits you. You were dismissive of both your wife and your niece. \n\nAnd in the end, the most important opinion is that of your niece. Does SHE want to recover and try to continue? Does she want to stop?

Your wife too, she needs to understand that tearing an ACL is a huge injury, I had a friend who tore his during soccer and he can't bend his knee as it used to anymore, he can't play soccer anymore and not even just because of the injury but now he's scared he'll do it again and set him back another year of covery.", "YTA - \n\nTo your wife: for downplaying her importance in your daughters (niece) life. She can take care and love her, but technically you can only make important decisions, because of a legal title in name only.\n\nTo your daughter (niece): she\u2019s 14, she should make the decision.

This can\u2019t just be a self contained issue when you tell her, her opinion doesn\u2019t matter. Wait and talk to your niece and her doctor and coach. It sounds like you\u2019re making a snap decision because you are scared.", "YTA, don\u2019t be a dictator with a teenager, ever. It\u2019s up to her to figure out what she wants, you as the adult should support it.", "YTA. Injuries will happen in sports. Some are worse than others, but they\u2019re kind of inevitable. If your niece enjoys doing gymnastics, if that\u2019s her passion, she should have the right to choose whether she wants to continue.\n\nIf you\u2019re really THAT concerned, you and your wife can ask a doctor for their opinion, but you don\u2019t have the right to just veto both your wife and your niece without considering either of their thoughts on the matter.\n\nPersonally, I admire your nieces grit and determination. And I think you should be encouraging of whatever she chooses.", "Your wife is right - your nieces desires about her chosen sport need to be taken into account here.

Or if your wife stopped doing anything for your niece/ daughter because she doesn\u2019t have \u201cofficial\u201d rights. That was a real low blow. I guess she\u2019s good enough when it\u2019s convenient for you that she act as an official mother and they don\u2019t have to call you for every little thing.

You say as long as she\u2019s happy and she wants to continue but your scared. Injuries happen to all athletes and that doesn\u2019t stop them. If she loves it how can you take that away from her. That makes you a bad dad since you don\u2019t actually care what your niece wants. \n\nSecond you undermine your wife who has done just as much for your niece and considers her a daughter. That makes you a jackass since you are fine having your wife help raise her but she can\u2019t make any decisions in regards to her. That\u2019s BS \n\nBe a better dad and husband", "YTA,so she\u2019s your equal partner in raising your niece until she disagrees with you.", "You seem to think your wife is also a child and not a partner.

If you expect to make all the decisions regarding your niece, then you shouldn't expect your wife to take on the responsibilities of caring for her either. I hope none of your wife's money goes toward your niece and you do 100% of the cooking, cleaning, chauffeuring and nurturing. Otherwise, you're asking your wife to take on the labor of caregiving but none of the authority.", "You're not wrong, Walter.", "YTA. Even though you are legally the guardian, you are both effectively her parents. There is no good that comes from making unilateral decisions without the other parent. Since she's a teenager, she should also have a say as to whether she wants to continue. \n\nShe enjoys gymnastics and it is a healthy outlet for teenage energy. If you take that away from her without giving her a choice, you're setting yourself up for a lot of problems - possible depression, hanging with the wrong people, having too much time on her hands to do less healthy activities, etc. No sport is without risk, but the benefits generally far outweigh them. It could even potentially get her a college scholarship if she's that good. I highly encourage you to re-think your stance. When gymnastics was taken from me without my choice, I fell into a depression and got into some pretty hard drugs to numb my feelings (which were not taken into account).", "YTA YTA YTA - You really need to make this decision with your niece, not for your niece. Injuries are a risk in ANY sport.\n\nYou take this away from her and she will resent you **forever**. This will not be something she ever forgives you for. And she would be right.

Don't be surprised when your wife steps back and your niece blames you for crushing her dreams. \n\nYou have changed your families dynamics and now you must live with the result. You really are an arse by making such demands of them both", "YTA.\n\nYou seem to be suffering from what i call king of the hill syndrome. Where you think you're the king of the castle and everyone is supposed to fall in line.", "Yta. You don't get to ask her to raise this girl and then not let her have equal say in parenting decisions. The fact that you would try suggests you suck in general.\n\nBeyond that. An ACL injury while painful can happen in literally any sport. It happens in basketball, tennis, running. It happens to people just walking down the street. Yes, gymnastics puts more strain on the joints and ligaments than some sports but injury is part of most any sport. Anyone who plays long enough will experience some. The overall health benefits are worth it for most. Your niece is old enough that if she wants to continue she should be able to do so.", "Yta I bet if this was a son with football, it'd be a different story.    And it's the exact same as your sons. Your wife is *raising* her niece.  Unless you do 100% of the parenting and use no joint money, then she has just as much input as you do.\n\n*Neither* of you, however, has as much input as the neice herself. It's *her* life, not yours.  She may not be able to do gymnastics anymore. She may have tk transition to floor routines.  It's her choice.  You can guide.  You can offer your opinion. You can bring in her coaches and former gymnastics to talk to her.", "Yep, YTA.  When your wife makes dinner do you stop her from making dinner for your niece because it is your responsibility?  When she offers to take her to practice do you stop her and tell her that you will do it since it is your sole responsibility as sole guardian?  When she needs help with homework, or relationship advice, or female hygiene issues are you prepared to tackle all of those issues on your own as sole guardian?  If not, shut your freaking mouth and give your wife the respect she deserves for taking in your niece along with you.  She deserves that much.  YTA", "Gentle YTA. I don't think 'I'm the sole legal guardian' goes all that far when, in every other circumstance, you do indeed treat your wife like your partner in raising our children (including your niece) and naturally expect her to treat your niece like her daughter. This is not a distinction you want to make if you can avoid it. What your wife is saying has merit - you should not withdraw your niece from the sport without her (your niece) being on board, as she will initially at least feel that she's being unfairly punished and will resent you.\n\nThe obvious answer here is to talk to them both. Yes, you have ultimate decision-making authority in the eyes of the law or whatnot, but the good parenting decision is to talk through your concerns with your niece and your wife. And I agree they should not be too influenced by the possibility of olympics some day - her long-term health (in my eyes at least) is more important. Maybe continuing in gymnastics WITHOUT the rigorous training associated with the goal of being an olympian is the path.", "YTA\n\nMarriage is a partnership. It is not a 'partnership when it's convenient for you'.", "If niece had Olympic potential then at 14 she would already be on her way. So that's not going to happen.\n\nYTA for what you said to your wife. I hope she stops doing all the chores involved in raising your niece for you.", "YTA.  The 14yo gets a voice.  It\u2019s got to be her choice.  Damn, this is parenting 101.

Excluding a 14 year old from their own life choices also doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m sure you mean well, but these are not your decisions to make by yourself.

Well, you\u2019ve really screwed up.", "Info:  Wht doesn't your wife have any legal custody of your niece?  Whose decision was that?", "Soft YTA in that she is a surrogate mom. I do agree with you in that as adults, you get the final say. Though you should consider her wants, if you think the sport is too dangerous, it's okay to make her quit.

I've been doing it for over 10 years, with no major issues. On the other hand I know people who have hurt themselves very badly, not just lifting but also playing soccer, baseball, hockey, volleyball etc. You can't protect your kids from everything.

It is a contact sport and concussions are a regular occurrence.", "Have you ever skied?

Then why let it dictate whether or not your niece can do something she *thrives* at? Instead of drawing a line and saying hard no she can\u2019t do it anymore, you should have opened a discussion to maybe taking it a little more easy with the training.

The thing about this subject, as I mentioned in my post, is that I feel my wife has a very naive view of the chances of a professional career, so I don't trust her judgment in this particular matter.", "How do you feel if this wasn\u2019t your niece but your children with her?

YTA", "I'm not going to make a judgement but I am a level 2 FIG gymnastics coach and a qualified sport scientist who specialises in the physical/mental health of youth athletes, so hopefully I can give you my perspective. \n\nFirstly, coaches telling parents that an athlete is 'special' is an incredibly common and scummy practice. There are millions of gymnasts in the world. There are currently 1700 athletes registered with the Federation of International Gymnastics, and only about 10% of them compete at the Olympics. It is insanely difficult to achieve this level, and even if an athlete has all the hard work and talent in the world, it doesn't mean they will achieve it. I would recommend focusing less on the outcomes of her performance (results & medals, etc) and focusing more on her effort and personal goals like what skills she wants to achieve, etc. What exactly does she want to achieve in gymnastics? If her only goal is to go to the Olympics, then I would suggest sitting her down to have an open conversation and set some realistic goals.\n\nSecondly, an ACL tear that requires surgery is a major injury, and she should be prepared for a long recovery and ongoing rehabilitation to avoid chronic injury. Returning too quickly and not rehabing properly could result in the injury just getting worse or flaring up when she is older. Not returning AT ALL to sport would actually be worse as she would likely not rebuild the strength back up and it could heal incorrectly. A gymnastics coach is not an expert on this, and I would recommend following the guidance of her medical team or physiotherapist . As a coach, I would also be concerned about what caused the injury. Yes, gymnastics is a high-impact sport. However, an injury in someone so young would raise concerns of something like a muscle imbalance, or her strength isn't up to her current skill level. Has the coach discussed with you what her return to gym plan will be? Have they told you how they would mitigate the risk moving forward? \n\nLastly, you are more than in your right to be concerned about your niece and her health. However, I don't think quitting gym is the right way to go about it, especially as she wants to get back to it and will likely resent this unilateral decision you have made. She also likely will not understand that you come from a place of concern and may feel as though you don't think she is good enough. She may be a child, but she is 14 and has been in the sport for almost her entire life. Instead of making the decision yourself, I would recommend talking to her about your concerns and explaining that, while she loves the sport, you are concerned about her health in the long term and discuss how she can proceed in her sport while taking care of her health (something like a strength plan or relaxation strategies etc).\n\nMoving forward, I would say you really need to have an open discussion with your wife, your niece, and her coach. Discuss the injury (what happened and why), your concerns around her long-term health, and what the plan is moving forward. This should include her return to the club and gradual increasing of her training, how to reduce the risk of injury occurring in the future, and what exactly you all expect from your nieces gymnastics career. At the end of the day, yes, you could remove her from her sport. But, if you respect and care for your niece, I would recommend approaching the topic of her return as a discussion and come up with a realistic plan  that you all can agree on. I think this would help calm your anxieties around the dangers of her sport while allowing your niece to make an informed decision about her own sports career.\n\nMy only caveat would be if her coach is more concerned with her return to competitions than her physical/mental health, move clubs immediately. If you have any questions, my inbox is always open.", "YTA, from someone who grew up in Olympic training in a sport far more dangerous than gymnastics. Athletes who get into a sport at that level of intensity aren\u2019t just training, they\u2019re existing and being and breathing. We dream in our sport. I\u2019m in training again now (my sport doesn\u2019t have an age limit) and I\u2019ve just realized I was subconsciously doing cues with my legs. That\u2019s how deep this runs.\n\nMy chance back then was taken by injury, but if my parent had just decided that the very core of my being was now disallowed, I would be so resentful. I would have been depressed and might have turned to self-destruction. I have seen this happen to far too many Olympic hopefuls in swimming, cycling, track, equestrian, whose parents put a stop to their dreams. Injury is one thing, it happens to the best of us - but someone outside the sport deciding you can\u2019t control your destiny is quite another.\n\nDon\u2019t try to stop your niece being what she is. She is a gymnast like a fish is a swimmer. Don\u2019t make her wonder for the rest of her life what might have been if you didn\u2019t take away her chance. Don\u2019t make her blame you (appropriately, I might add) for that.", "How has your niece done in meets? At her age and with her training regimen, you should know if she is reaching the elite level.", "OP, do you not like your wife? Do you want a divorce and to split custody of your sons? Because I am here to tell you that's EXACTLY what's going to happen if you continue on like this. Your wife has been in your niece's life for at least 10 years as her practical mother, doing maternal tasks while being a wife and bearing and raising your sons as well. \n\nYou just slapped her in the face that you have all the power and she is meaningless.\n\nI really don't know how you come back from that. You trashed her trust in you as a husband and father.", "YTA. You say \u201cour girl\u201d but you mean your property, a being without agency. Your wife is good enough to feed, love, nurture, and support your niece, but she should shut up and not share in decision making when it comes to your niece? Your assholery knows no bounds, my guy. Then you should not expect her to handle any heavy lifting where the child is concerned. You\u2019ll handle all feeding, laundry, school meetings, doctors and dental appointments, all driving to friends and after school activities. Alternatively, you could hire her as your nieces nanny offering competitive salary, right? Because, otherwise she has zero rights to influence decisions for the child. I hope you get a clue before you not only damage your relationship with your niece, but your marriage.", "So I'd like to ask you: What are you going to do when she says that this is her dream and she wants to pursue this as a career? Or even just as an intense hobby? Are you going to tell her you won't support her dreams? Because that's an easy way to have your niece go no-contact when she's old enough to move out. Keeping her from doing this because 'it isn't worth it' isn't your decision: That's your nieces decision. SHE'S the one with the injury, SHE'S the one in pain. If SHE decides that this pain is worth it to her, then she's the one that knows the limits to her own body the best. She's lived in her body her whole life, and just because she's not 18 years old doesn't mean that she's incapable of making decisions for herself, even at 14. That's ONLY 4 years away from moving age. Not to mention the more she practices the less likely she'll be to injure herself.\n\nObviously if the doctors were telling you it was unsafe for her to continue, that's another thing entirely because that's a relevant medical professional getting involved. But YOU don't know the limits to her body. She's not very likely to die from what she's doing, and if she does reach that point where a doc tells her can't do this anymore, then it's better to have loved and lost than to have never have loved at all. All you're doing is hurting her and pushing her away. Ruining her dreams which will most likely give her depression or anxiety. So long as you can financially and timely afford to continue letting her do this, then you should let your niece do what SHE wants to do. This is going to impact her WHOLE life if you just pull her out: What would all of that work have been for? Why did she go through all this time working so hard for something she loved if it was just going to get pulled away from her from people who don't know what she's capable of? She might think that you don't believe in her, she might develop a fear of things getting taken from her, becoming protective and more secretive from you. \n\nI can tell you really love her, which is great, but if you tell her she can't train anymore, she's going to end up taking something away from you. Her. Please don't ruin her life because you're scared that she'll get hurt when not even SHE is scared that she'll get hurt.

YTA.", "Just in case you\u2019re not where I\u2019m from, in Australia we have the afl- Australian Football League. There was a now banned move called the specky, this was when you marked the ball while utilising the back of usually an opponent player. This fairly commonly caused a lot of back and spinal injuries. In football.\nI played field hockey as a teen, was tripped by a girl on the other team with her stick and landed square on my knee caused soft damage through the whole knee and I was off field for six weeks. Shittiest six weeks of my life at 14, I hated not being on field and barely walking. But when the six weeks was over and I went back I was happy as a lamb back doing something I loved till I chose to stop a few years later.\nSports caused injuries a wide range and as a parent you have very right to your concern. I haven\u2019t had a single hobby in my life that hadn\u2019t caused me some kind of injury, ballet, karate, hockey, basketball any number of the artistic pursuits I\u2019ve taken up, I have scars all over. And at the end of the day none of them hold me back except occasionally one. And that one is the one I gained through a job that had me sitting probably 4-5 hours a day sitting nurse side for a dentist, sitting on this seat I would always turn to the right at the waist to grab what we needed for the procedure. This continual action over a year led to me beginning to develop a bulge disc in my spine. This can lead to disabling pain and function, and I have seen people unable to walk and have to be carried as a result if it.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is you will never be able to fully defend anyone from what the world or their own bodies may give them. Never. Yes, your niece has torn her acl. It is exceedingly common to do that across all sports, it happens in afl every other week once the season starts. Some people do still retire from their sport once they make a recovery but most don\u2019t. This is your nieces life, not yours. This sport appears to bring her joy and like me in my six week break she\u2019s anticipating being able to do what she knows she can again as an athlete. She is a teen, not a small child with no sense of danger she understands more now than ever that her sport can result in injury. Your wife is completely correct you don\u2019t get to make this decision for your niece, it\u2019s her decision. \n\nI do wonder what you would say to your sons if they were 14 playing their sports with the same injury. Would you be encouraging them through their recovery period or would you be banning them from their passions also?\n\nI feel from your post and your comments you lack respect for your wife and niece, the common denominator there is they\u2019re both female, so do you just lack respect because their women?\n\nYTA. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read enough of the comments here to know why. I\u2019ve provided you examples at the start because a wide range of sports and even just things in our every day lives can lead to injuries far greater than your niece may ever experience in the pursuit of her sport. As I said, my worst injury is from sitting in a chair. Something doesn\u2019t have to be dangerous to be crippling, and just because something is dangerous doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done safely, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have things like sky diving, bungee jumping, roller coasters, snowboarding and so much more.\n\nRespect your wife as the coparent she is, respect your niece as an athlete and last of all simply respect both as people able to make decisions for themselves. You owe your wife an apology.", "YTA for a few reasons \n\nMy friend tore their ACL falling in the shower - somehow. This injury could have happened multiple ways. I appreciate that you're trying to remove/reduce the risk by removing the voluntary activity but you're not guaranteeing her anything by doing so. \n\nYou say you see her in pain and don't think the impact on her body is worth it - all the while she clearly thinks/understands that it is. Why are you dismissing her feelings about this? Injury is a very common thing for pro athletes - it's something they learn to deal with and manage. Sam Kerr missed multiple world cup soccer games with an injury, Daniel ricciardo needed surgery on his hand. It's just something that happens and you deal with it. It actually sounds like your niece/daughter and wife have a pretty good attitude to it. \n\nAlso I appreciate your concern about the impact in her body in general. Gymnastics gone hard but not done well can be a problem. You can overstretch ligaments without the supporting muscle and really stuff your body. But stopping can also stuff your body. I speak from experience, I was that kid that did 20hrs a week, but wasn't doing strength training. I stopped cold turkey and didn't replace it with anything else. As an adult now I pay for those decisions, I'm overweight, my joints hurt from the lack of support and muscle strength, i suck at nutrition because I was able to get away with eating whatever before. I would have been significantly better off if I stuck with the sport. \n\nHowever, you would not be TA if you used this as an example/reason as to why she also needs to focus on her academics and cultivate other interests. Anything might happen (including something outside of Gymnastics) that may prevent her from even attempting a career at this. \n\nKeep in mind, assuming an injury doesn't prevent her - this could help her through college, get her in somewhere that her academics might not otherwise so even if she never takes it pro beyond college it may open up other academic opportunities that will seriously help her for the rest of her life.", "YTA. Majorly. First, for telling your wife that your niece is less hers than she is yours. If you have the legal option to suggest your wife file for legal adoption or guardianship, that is the best way to ask her forgiveness and admit your mistake. \n\nSecond, your niece/daughter is old enough to weigh in on the direction her life will take. Of course you need to be available to counsel her and set boundaries, but she is certainly of the age to be able to look back on her life with regret or bitterness. If she wants to close the door on gymnastics, that\u2019s fine, but you would be twice the a-hole if you pulled the plug on this passion/sport/career for her.", "YTA. I assume you expect to your wife to care for and parent your niece, correct? But you think you can just cut her out of all decision making? Also, your niece is 14, she\u2019s not a child, and she should have a say in her future.

As someone who didn't have access to classes or lessons for things I was interested in and is now struggling due to a lack of experience, I'm begging you to PLEASE let her continue if she wants to and her doctors agree that it's safe. Any kind of education is better, and if the gyms are willing to sponsor it, then you're not really losing out on as much. Not to mention even if it doesn't turn into a career, it's exercise, it's enrichment, it keeps her in good shape for other opportunities, and again she might find herself wanting to tech gymnastics or needing to if she found herself in trouble financially. Learning ANY kind of skill comes with several different branches. She might not make it as a gymnast, but those skills she learns could help her with other kinds of careers. Dancing, coaching, judging, etc. (Also I know my response is all over the place I'm neurodivergent sorry)\n\nEdit: I think my main point here is that no one knows if what they're reaching for is going to turn into a career or not.

That\u2019s what you should have said to your wife.\n\n\u201cWife, I hear what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m glad you believe in Niece. I\u2019m afraid for her health, and I want to make sure she wants to do this. I also want her to know that we love her regardless. Let\u2019s talk with her about it together\u201d\n\nFriend, you have valid points but you approached it poorly. You Wife is your partner in life, treat her like she is.", "Talk. To. Your. Niece.", "Dude. Do you even hear yourself? She has too much AMBITION for you? It's fine for her to do the work *to save you money, but not because she thinks she can actually successful?*", "It\u2019s still her choice to make, regardless of her reasons. She needs to come to the conclusion on her own. \n\nYou are terrible at risk analysis. The risk of her getting a very serious injury is minimal. The risk that she will be extremely hurt if you force this on her is 100%.", "You\u2019re the AH because you\u2019re preoccupied with being right and commanding the respect of being in charge instead of what your niece actually needs.  \n\n\nYou are condescending and mansplaining in the comments when others make points you don\u2019t agree with.  But you\u2019re the sole legal guardian! You know what\u2019s best! Look at all the money you\u2019ve invested so far!\n\n\nIt may sound \u201ctruthful\u201d in your mind, but frankly you sound insufferable.", "Oh it was my knees that took a beating. They\u2019re perfect now, though!", "You\u2019re not forbidden from engaging in the discussion.\n\nIt\u2019s just that your responses make it sound like you\u2019re a control freak who doesn\u2019t respect the wants and opinions of your niece or your wife.", "You come across as a controlling ass.", "let me tell you as someone who lived this- if you take this away from her without talking it out and supporting her recovery fully- you will crush her. and not in a way that she will \u201ceventually get over it and realize i did the right thing\u201d your fears as a parent are normal, but they aren\u2019t her fears. she has her dreams and she seems to have proven she is willing to work and sacrifice for them and performs and competes well at a high level. an ACL tear is not necessarily a career ending injury. if you want a happy and healthy child, support her goals and dreams.\n\nwhen it comes to your wife YTA big time. if you get all the say then you should do all the work and all the things your wife has been doing. as you say \u201cour girl\u201d sees your wife as her mom, she already had one mother figure not want her and now you want to sow division into a seemingly normal loving mother/daughter relationship?? \n\nyou are creating drama and then playing victim. most people here, including me, aren\u2019t attacking you. you asked a question, answers were given. be the mature person you were when you stepped up and took in a child, the one who provided and loved that little girl. be that person again in this moment and put your fears and doubts aside and put your daughter and wife first. apologize to your wife and then support you daughter in whatever she needs.", "Have you spoken to her recently? Like, since she\u2019s been injured? Doesn\u2019t sound like it. \n\nIn your posts, she still sounds very passionate about gymnastics. Wait until she\u2019s healed, then talk to a sports medicine doctor to get their opinion on if it\u2019s safe for her to continue training. Have the talk with her *then*, okay? Don\u2019t just jump to conclusions. That\u2019ll just hurt more.\n\nAnd yes, YTA for what you said to your wife. Apologize for that. She\u2019s raising this kid just as much as you are, blood-related or not.", "Again, that is her choice to make. Hobby, professional, turn back, or keep going. Those are all up to her to learn from and figure out along her journey. \n\nAlso, soccer and gymnastics are super different. One is a team sport, one is a lot more independent. She could always do this as a hobby, whether she is the best or worst. \n\nLife is about changes. She might do this her whole life, and that'd be dope to see her in the Olympics after reading all your pessimism, or decide she genuinely wants to be done next week. You don't get to choose that because, again, you are scared of potential outcomes.", "I would suggest adoption to your wife. That the two of you would have her covered as loving caretakers. I think without that and an apology I would have a very hard time letting this go as your wife. She is raising her just as much if not more than you are and has been for many years based on your comments. I would go to her, apologize, ask if she wants to be an equal partner in her upbringing legally, and then have this conversation with your niece and your wife. Talk it through. You aren\u2019t the be all end all, you are a guiding presence in her life and you should act like it, she should have a say in her own future. If you make this choice for her now she\u2019d never be able to come back from four years without training and she might hold that against you forever. Do you want her to think of you as the person who destroyed her dreams?", "I will edit.. I made an error.. no big deal.. LOL", "Maybe it was phonetic, like \"eh..shh\"", "Lol your comments read \"You're doing it wrong! I don't know how to do it right, I'm just convinced that you are wrong.\"", "You'll notice whenever a woman is advised to just let dad handle it, people come and claim its harming or punishing the child.\n\nIt's honestly a bit misandrist but the MGTOW don't seem to agree with me on that.", "So since the results are in I should refrain from commenting any further? Honestly, if I got here and posted something like: \"Thank you everybody for this wake-up call, I now realize I behaved like a massive AH and I'll apologize to my wife and hope she'll forgive me etc\", I sense I'd still be downvoted like there's no tomorrow.\n\nAny attempts I made here to discuss or clarify some points were seen as an indication that I'm unable to \"accept\" the jury's verdict.", "My mom encouraged my sister in her \"music\" but never encouraged me with my \"art\" so I can see how much as an adult I still resent my mom for that.", "it\u2019s not too late! music is for any age.", "I have a very similar background with music, sports, and extracurriculars. Looking back, our home and my life was chaotic and I wish I had grown up with better balance. Not only that, but being unable to make decisions with the level of athletics I pursued put me in a corner and did not teach how to be independent. It was like pulling nails convincing my parents to let me quit a sport for a documented medical reason. And the control extended into college with sports and what degree I pursued. \n\nIt's great hearing from someone who has a similair experience. Our parents want the best for us, and try to compensate for their parent's failures, but will often become overburdening.", "That's really sad, I'm sorry", "Where does liability fall into any of this? The child was injured doing a sport? What the hell are you talking about?", ">I do believe they saw some true potential in her, because they\u2019re covering for most of her training and even travel expenses to competitions\n\nFrom another comment by OP.\n\nAnd knowing what I know as a big fan of NCAA gymnastics and what OP said in his post, his niece could potentially be (or on the way to being) a high-level level 10 gymnast, and that group is small enough that the scholarship likelihood is decent and the schools she would be recruited by offer pretty good NIL prospects, which isn't limited to just brand deals or sponsorships. It also includes money from the school itself when it establishes collectives that raise money and distribute it to the team. Gymnastics is also one of only 6 NCAA sports where DI schools can (and do) offer full-rides, rather than partial scholarships.", "That struck me too.  Yikes.", "Good to hear. Thanks again for sharing. If I ever have a daughter who wants to go into dressage, I\u2019ll have some ideas to work with.", "Well I ain't no expert.\n\nPunishing your child just isn't a good way to deal with things that **aren't their fault**.\n\nRather punish the husband instead. I'm sure she does **alot** for him that he takes granted.", "Your attempts to clarify and discuss haven\u2019t helped because you\u2019re engaged in wild mental gymnastics to \u201cprove\u201d that you should have unilateral power. Like, how does your wife\u2019s financial responsibility in a hypothetical divorce have *anything* to do with coparenting?\n\nThat said, I\u2019m curious whether you actually feel like you\u2019re in the wrong and owe the wife an apology, or is that just a rhetorical question meant to manipulate?", "I see I\u2019ve struck a nerve. Good.\n\nIf you\u2019ve accepted your judgment, which you should because that\u2019s the reason this sub exists in the first place, I see no harm in adding exactly that to this post. Take accountability for being TA.\n\nAnd who cares about downvotes??? This is a THROWAWAY ACCOUNT!!!", "If you said that and you got downvoted, who cares, it's a throw away. Fact is you haven't said that and are still arguing with everyone instead of self reflecting.", "Are you being deliberately obtuse, or are you genuinely incapable of understanding why you are the AH?", "If you did apologise and actually conveyed remorse in your actions it shouldn't matter if it gets downvoted, it's your wife that matters, not the internet.\nJust hope that what you said hasn't been detrimental to your relationship or to how your wife feels in her own home regarding the child she is also raising.", "As a parent, I gotta say that a parent who forces you into hobbies you don\u2019t care about doesn\u2019t care about what\u2019s best for you. They care about how to slot you into the perfect child pattern they have in their head. \n\nA parent who is actually focused on what\u2019s best for their child is led by their child\u2019s interests, because that\u2019s how you explore your talents and aptitudes.", "It's really easy for the mom to say yeah let her continue when she's not responsible for medical bills. The dad's already commented that he can't afford to go get a second opinion to ensure she's even receiving the proper medical care. If she needs medical help going forward, guess who has to pay those bills?", "As I said in the edit, this isn't about randomly punishing the niece; it is about the OP facing the consequences of their choices. He wants to be solely in charge, this is what it means - and you don't cut the kid off, you explain what the hell is going on, and why you're doing it. Kid is 14 - an explanation is almost always the best call at that age.", "I couldn't care less about karma. Fact is that some other genuine attempts I made here to further explain the situation, or to reflect over some feedback I got (seemingly in good faith), were met with a similar attitude - \"why are you still posting here, it's clear YTA\".", "You realize that they're both paying for that child since they're married?", "So you\u2019re still saying that the mom should just cut the kid off. Telling the kid why doesn\u2019t make it any better."]}
