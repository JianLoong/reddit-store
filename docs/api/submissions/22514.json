I can do basic walking but standing for a long time in heels really just hurts. The wedding starts in the afternoon and goes until midnight and there will be a standing cocktail hour and a reception with a dance floor so there will be a lot of standing and I want to be able to dance comfortably. I don\u2019t own any flats at the moment and can\u2019t really afford a new pair that I\u2019ll never wear again since I have to buy plane tickets to fly to this wedding. Also, I really don\u2019t want to have to put the time& pain into breaking in a pair of flats and potentially having them still be uncomfortable or painful at the wedding.\n\nI decided I\u2019m just going to wear my doc martens (basic black) since a) I\u2019m not in the wedding party and won\u2019t be in many pictures b) my dress is floor length so they\u2019ll barely be seen and c) they\u2019re my most comfortable shoe other than my running shoes. \n\nMy sister says that it would be incredibly disrespectful for me to wear them and that I have to figure out a more formal pair of shoes. She insists I have enough time to either learn how to walk in heels or break in a pair of flats. I just don\u2019t think I want to put myself through that pain just for one day where I\u2019m just a guest and won\u2019t be affecting photos and I have a very nice dress. AITA/am I being selfish?\n\n\nETA: thank you for all the helpful responses! I\u2019ve never been to a wedding so I didn\u2019t know that switching into comfier shoes was an option.

What you need to do is look for a comfortable alternative that suits the dress code. \n\nSimple flats work great, if you have a similar shoe size to family/friends you might be able to borrow a pair, thrift shops, cheap stores etc. There are heaps of comfortable, inexpensive options that will suit.", "Hellooooooo ballet style flats duh", "NTA.  I wore DMs under my dress at my own wedding.  No one had a clue!  I showed them off to my guests later on in the day and they all thought it was hilarious.", "Wearing doc martens under a floor length dress does not attract attention negative or otherwise. \n\nMy bridesmaid (with my permission) wore her doc martens under her full length dress and no one batted an eye. She looked amazing and most importantly was comfortable. \n\nBut we\u2019re both neurodiverse (her adhd and me autism so I guess we don\u2019t care so much for social conventions) \n\nOp is N T A for wanting to wear comfy shoes, however the sister is also N T A for suggesting a compromise on the type of shoes \n\nSo NAH", ">I wasn\u2019t sure how common it was to switch shoes/remove shoes.\n\nI've been to a couple weddings in the past few years. People keep their nice shoes on for the initial mingling, the ceremony, and the cocktail hour. Once that's over, everyone tends to get a bit comfier.\n\nAt the receptions, I think the majority of women had removed their heels. Several smart ladies had flats in their purses and a few just went barefoot. Being barefoot isn't a good idea though (especially from a safety perspective, drunk people occasionally knock their glass over and no one wants to step on that).", "Adults wear appropriate attire to events. A high schooler would wear doc Martin's with a floor length gown because they think it makes them look edgy and cool. That's the impression I get from you. Especially since you're acting like flats are made out of nails.", ">Boots are flat and mean my dress would still be floor length and hide the shoes.\n\nOnly if you never move... Since you're likely intending to dance or at least walk, the doc martins would be much, much worse than wedges or flats.\n\nBlack tie events are very formal. With a dress code like that, it's both tacky and disrespectful to dress casually (which docs are).\n\nYour new plans of either buying comfy dress shoes or wearing heels then changing into flats are both better options", "The quoted comments makes me think this person have some maturing to do.\nDresscodes will not ever go away even if one think its stupid.\nYes, adults will shame you for not dressing polite.\nYes, people do talk about screw ups for a long time and judge your character by it. What would the point of \"dresscodes\" be, if everyone just didnt care and came as they self felt like..?\nGrow up and stick to the adult social rules.", ">I\u2019m surprised myself tbh. I\u2019m no youngster but I\u2019ve becomes accustomed to the boots and dress look, and I\u2019m really surprised that people are so pissed about this. I mean, it\u2019s a legitimate style/look that I\u2019ve seen on the wedding thread on Reddit for fucks sake.\n\nI suspect that's because you missed that the wedding is black tie. That means it is a very specific and formal dress code.\n\nIn normal circumstances, you're right. Boots with a dress are a legit style and it can look very nice. I can't say I personally like docs with a dress, but I'm sure someone can pull it off. It could even look a bit fancy despite how causal docs are depending on the dress chosen.\n\nBut there is no way that look is appropriate for a black tie event."]}
