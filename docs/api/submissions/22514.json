I can do basic walking but standing for a long time in heels really just hurts. The wedding starts in the afternoon and goes until midnight and there will be a standing cocktail hour and a reception with a dance floor so there will be a lot of standing and I want to be able to dance comfortably. I don\u2019t own any flats at the moment and can\u2019t really afford a new pair that I\u2019ll never wear again since I have to buy plane tickets to fly to this wedding. Also, I really don\u2019t want to have to put the time& pain into breaking in a pair of flats and potentially having them still be uncomfortable or painful at the wedding.\n\nI decided I\u2019m just going to wear my doc martens (basic black) since a) I\u2019m not in the wedding party and won\u2019t be in many pictures b) my dress is floor length so they\u2019ll barely be seen and c) they\u2019re my most comfortable shoe other than my running shoes. \n\nMy sister says that it would be incredibly disrespectful for me to wear them and that I have to figure out a more formal pair of shoes. She insists I have enough time to either learn how to walk in heels or break in a pair of flats. I just don\u2019t think I want to put myself through that pain just for one day where I\u2019m just a guest and won\u2019t be affecting photos and I have a very nice dress. AITA/am I being selfish?\n\n\nETA: thank you for all the helpful responses! I\u2019ve never been to a wedding so I didn\u2019t know that switching into comfier shoes was an option.

I have a couple of pairs and they are my go-to when I need something quick to put on.", "You say you don\u2019t want to stick out, but the overall sentiment  in your comments you keep making is that no one *should* care about what shoes you\u2019re wearing or that you think it doesn\u2019t matter because people might not notice. If people didn\u2019t care, there wouldn\u2019t be a dress code.", "Then the family busybodies need to be put in their place. She is not parading around in a low cut mini dress it's boots covered by a long dress. I really doubt most people will even see them.", "Sorry, I wasn\u2019t trying to make it about that at all. That\u2019s why i made this post and I already said in another comment I\u2019m going to try to find a pair of thick heels or wedges and bring some sandals to change into.", "I get that, but that doesn\u2019t mean in 20 years people from the wedding will still think of me as \u201cthe girl who wore boots to a wedding\u201d. I\u2019m a fun person and I\u2019ll more likely be remembered for being one of the first on the dance floor or for starting up some nice conversations about the brides. I just can\u2019t imagine that I would go down in history for the shoes I wore to a wedding\u2026", "Funnily enough my mom and both my sisters all have the same sized feet, I\u2019m the odd one out with much smaller feet so I can\u2019t borrow \ud83d\ude05", "That\u2019s what I thought. Hence me asking for advice on here. My friend has never been very formal and I\u2019ve never been to a black tie wedding so I wasn\u2019t sure how much a guest\u2019s shoes actually mattered", "That\u2019s a good point. I\u2019m going to take some other peoples advice and look for some other options but if it comes down to being a month out and I still don\u2019t have anything then I\u2019ll ask. Thank you!", "They are busy. They already sent dress code, no they don\u2019t need to look at each guest outfit. Normal people know or can google \u201c black tie \u201c and find out it\u2019s most formal attire desired. Gowns and such.", "Oh thank you so much!!", "Of course! I think there\u2019s time/place/circumstances under which social norms abided by out of respect for the situation (don\u2019t go strapless in a synagogue, don\u2019t flash major cleavage at a funeral lol) but (in MY opinion) something like boots at a wedding isn\u2019t worth sweating over. It\u2019s all up to you of course! Good luck with your outfit \ud83e\udee1", "Where would I put the heels once I switched?", "Thank you, I was planning on cleaning them and polishing them up beforehand \ud83d\ude0a I agree, it should be a happy occasion!", "You should just go to a thrift store and buy appropriate flats or see if you can borrow some from friends or family so you are dressed appropriately.", "I think its a touch ironic that youre concerned about wedges being \"too summery\" but see no issue wearing the ol shitkickers. \n\nIf you buy shoes that fit well they shouldnt rub that bad - that may take awhile walking around in a shoe store. Sometimes, a bandaid or certain inserts can help with heel rubbing as well.\n\nYTA, not by a lot, but you should read up a little on black tie formal vs other dress codes and it might put it in to better perspective why this would matter", "I wore wedges in my own wedding, more comfortable didn't have to worry about balance", "Oo I never even thought about Toms! Thank you so much!", "The overall sentiment in my comments has been that I\u2019m going to try and find a pair of heels and then change into comfier shoes\u2026 I\u2019ve only disagreed with people saying I\u2019ll \u201cforever be known as the girl who wore boots to a wedding\u201d which just sounds ridiculous to me?", "Most won't remember it was you but someone might say remember how some girl wore boots with her dress. If it it lives on past the wedding your name will probably be divorced from it.", "Bummer. Maybe ordering online second hand or something, then. I get how it is not to be able borrow. My mom and I probably wear a similar shoe size, but she always wears heels to special occasions. My feet would be killing me and/or I would tip over if I tried to wear her shoes!", "Under your chair, under a table, or with someone sitting out.", "This is going to depend on specific details to your event. You say you\u2019re flying to this wedding, so are you renting a car? If so, stash them out there. If there\u2019s a coat check, bring a bag they can fit in and hand them off when you make the switch. Otherwise just covertly slide them off under the table, then go put on the flats. No one will care about you carrying them out at the end of the night.", "And in all honesty, you can just wear the roll up flats if you want. Your dress sounds like it\u2019s floor length more or less. From the front the roll up flats just look like regular flats, so unless you\u2019re flashing your legs out at people, no one will notice, and it will be way more appropriate than the DMs.", "Wedges are heeled and would show under my dress, that\u2019s why I was not thinking about them. Boots are flat and mean my dress would still be floor length and hide the shoes. I\u2019m new to weddings and have never been to a black tie event which is why I posted this so I appreciate the advice!", "They have a sale on right now - \u00a335/$38 for some pairs! The Alpargata metallic black linen are really cute \ud83e\udd70", "You\u2019re doing it again. Acting like people don\u2019t care or won\u2019t remember. Sure, there will be some people who do not give a flying fuck, but there will be others who do. If your hosts didn\u2019t care, there wouldn\u2019t be a dress code. \n\nJust to recap though, here are the *numerous* comments in which you have implied that people wouldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t care, so don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t say it multiple times:\n\n> I would hope it wouldn\u2019t be asked about or be a topic of conversation at all. Who cares what shoes you\u2019re wearing?  \n\n> Out of an entire fun & beautiful wedding\u2026 would that really be the thing people remembered?\n\n> I would think me being there (and wearing an appropriate dress) would be more important to my friend than my barely visible shoes\u2026\n\n> I get that, but that doesn\u2019t mean in 20 years people from the wedding will still think of me as \u201cthe girl who wore boots to a wedding\u201d. I\u2019m a fun person and I\u2019ll more likely be remembered for being one of the first on the dance floor or for starting up some nice conversations about the brides. I just can\u2019t imagine that I would go down in history for the shoes I wore to a wedding\u2026\n\n> That just seems very similar to high school and not what adults actually think/do? I just feel like if my boots under my dress affect someone else so much then maybe they need to focus more on enjoying the wedding and not judging people?", "Out of an entire fun & beautiful wedding\u2026 would that really be the thing people remembered?", "Oo thank you! I\u2019m going to check it out tonight \ud83d\ude0a", "I did say it multiple times when people suggested I should just not attend if I couldn\u2019t wear the right shoes. Everyone who actually suggested good shoe options I listened to and I\u2019m already online looking for heels and wedges. I do honestly think that if you\u2019re at a wedding and you care about the shoes another guest is wearing then that\u2019s weird as fuck, I won\u2019t back down in that (because it is a very weird thing to care about). But I am listening to suggestions and am already putting them into action. I don\u2019t want to draw attention away since apparently people do care about guest\u2019s shoes which I didn\u2019t realize. I\u2019ve never been to a wedding and genuinely didn\u2019t know.", "You\u2019re acting like people can\u2019t remember numerous things. They can remember the fun time they had and the person who didn\u2019t follow the dress code. Look, if you\u2019re so insistent that no one will care, why did you even post here? The responses here have been pretty uniform in telling you wearing the DMs is not the best option. If you aren\u2019t willing to listen, that\u2019s on you.\n\nAnd for the record, yes, I absolutely glaringly remember the time someone wasn\u2019t meeting the dress code at a wedding I attended. Do I personally care that they weren\u2019t? Nope. But everyone in our core group remembers, and it still gets brought up occasionally close to two decades later.", "Oh trust me.\nYou don\u2019t want to be \u201c that girl\u201d. \n\nPeople remember wedding was fun or cute and also remember \u201c that friend of the groom what was in white dress\u201d .", "Also, I know someone recommended donating the shoes to a thrift store afterwards, but don\u2019t. You might be in this same position in the future and regret it \ud83d\ude04", "No, by making these comments you\u2019re arguing with people telling you why it\u2019s inappropriate to not adhere to the dress code. If you don\u2019t want to hear the YTA votes, you should have just gone to a fashion sub and asked for affordable shoe options for a black tie wedding. Someone telling you it\u2019s inappropriate because or people will care because shouldn\u2019t be met with \u201cbut they shouldn\u2019t care because it\u2019s weird as fuck.\u201d Again, why do you think there is a dress code in place? Presumably your friends at least had some say in their own wedding. They could have chosen a completely laid back casual, come as you are event just as easily. They didn\u2019t, so stop arguing that people shouldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t care about these things because the reality is some people do.", "I have agreed with people who have suggested better options. I\u2019ve agreed with people saying \u201cYTA\u201d. I have decided not to wear boots and to go another route. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re projecting onto me or if you\u2019re putting me into some box of a type of person you hate but I literally made this post to get a real answer and I have gotten a real answer, which is why I will not be wearing the boots and will be doing something else.", "You asked why you were being downvoted, and I explained why. You didn\u2019t like my answer. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going back and forth about. My actual suggestion to you was to buy roll up ballet flats you can put in your handbag for the evening. This discussion we\u2019re having right now is about why you were being downvoted."]}
