But some months ago, his mom got a heart attack and died. We are still grieving because they were amazing people and they were amazing in laws to me.\n\nWhen his dad died left some inheritance and left the rest to the mom, but she didn't spend what was left, and so all what she originally got plus her own savings and life insurance got inherited to John. So he ended up with a huge amount of money. We aren't exactly Elon Musk, but compared to our previous economic situation, it is amazing. Then we realized that could go and find our dream home.\n\nWe searched for houses for a while, and then found a beautiful little 3 bedroom house, no HOA, with a nice backyard, in a nice neighborhood. We went to see it and loved it, but while we were leaving realized that there was an elementary school right nextby. There was a long queue of cars and could hear the children screening and playing. John and I dont want children, I dont hate children, but when I was little my dad's house was next to a school and it was hell, you can hear every single thing the kids do and the cars of the parents picking their kids up makes it impossible to transit.\n\nI told John that I didn't want to buy the house because of the school and he asked me if I was crazy, this is a huge opportunity and it doesn't matter if there are some kids around. But I do not want to live next to a school. He says I'm being unreasonable and we can't let this opportunity go away, but I won't feel comfortable living there.\n\nIt turned into a screaming match and he was yelling so much that I got scared of him and called my girl-friend to go out for the night. We went to a bar so I could try not to think about this whole thing and got drunk, so I ended up at her place, she, while still tipsy, told me I was crazy and my husband was right. This surprised me because she supported me when she was sober, but I think this is her true opinion.\n\nThis morning he texted me 100 times asking if I had come to my senses.

Buying something that has a feature one or the other of you know you don\u2019t like is unwise. It almost always sets you up for immediately looking for something better, which isn\u2019t what you want when you buy your home. \n\nOn another note, your husband is way wrong for getting so upset and angry he made you fearful. Not ok. That\u2019s an even bigger issue to contemplate than the house, imo.", "NTA. The back up around the elementary school when my kids were there was crazy.

That's a reasonable position to have.\n\nFor your husband, the school is basically irrelevant, and the house is ideal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I think you might be wrong. You don't want kids, so presumably you expect to have a full-time job, which means that at the times when parents are dropping off and picking up their kids from school, you aren't home. So I'd really ask yourself whether this actually affects you as much as you think.", "ESH. This has nothing to do with whether you should buy the house and everything to do with the fact that you guys don't know how to resolve marital disputes in a healthy manner. Screaming matches, running off, getting drunk and failing to come home are not the way.  And on the bright side (for Jon at least, because this is his money), if you don't buy the house and end up divorcing, he can buy it on his own.", "NTA Large purchases should be agreed upon by both.", "Nta But neither is he. \nYou might want to compromise or yiu will end up alone.", "ESH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a decades long investment.

It's also valid to not see that as a big deal. But buying a house is a two-yes, one-no situation. You both need to be on the same page or it's not going to work out.\n\nSo no one is an asshole for disagreeing on the house. Where you both are assholes is the fact that this disagreement escalated into a shouting match that led to you running off to get drunk with a friend.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, there's room for the two of you to argue and disagree without escalating to screams, shouts, threats and drinking. The two of you don't need to be in lockstep, but screaming at each other over which house to buy is frankly distressing to even think about.", "ESH\n\nIf you guys are married then getting a house should a group decision that shouldn't be a screaming match. Compromise should be a thing as well, and it looks like you aren't giving any leeway whatsoever either.", "ESH, you both clearly need to work on communication without yelling or getting drunk. You have the right not to want to live by a school. Have him read AITA, there are plenty of nightmare stories here to support you. There will be another home that meets your needs, heck build one to exactly how you all want it if you can.", "YTA for running off to a bar to get drunk.

But our area is growing.  We need more schools.  It was decided that land was being under utilized.  The farm was just big enough to fit a physical school.

From 7:30 am to 4:30 pm, school buses rumble by our bed room. We hear EVERY announcement, and because it is a Pre-k, they are more annoying than usual, just because they are sooo up beat and loud.

And of course lots of people happily live near schools.\n\nThe mature way to handle this is with a discussion of pros and cons of all the houses. Nobody ever resolved anything with a screaming match. But he should be willing to listen to you until he understands your objections. That doesn\u2019t mean your objections should override all the negatives of the other options, but he needs to consider them.
