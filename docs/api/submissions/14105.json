But some months ago, his mom got a heart attack and died.

So he ended up with a huge amount of money. We aren't exactly Elon Musk, but compared to our previous economic situation, it is amazing. Then we realized that could go and find our dream home.\n\nWe searched for houses for a while, and then found a beautiful little 3 bedroom house, no HOA, with a nice backyard, in a nice neighborhood. We went to see it and loved it, but while we were leaving realized that there was an elementary school right nextby. There was a long queue of cars and could hear the children screening and playing. John and I dont want children, I dont hate children, but when I was little my dad's house was next to a school and it was hell, you can hear every single thing the kids do and the cars of the parents picking their kids up makes it impossible to transit.\n\nI told John that I didn't want to buy the house because of the school and he asked me if I was crazy, this is a huge opportunity and it doesn't matter if there are some kids around. But I do not want to live next to a school. He says I'm being unreasonable and we can't let this opportunity go away, but I won't feel comfortable living there.\n\nIt turned into a screaming match and he was yelling so much that I got scared of him and called my girl-friend to go out for the night. We went to a bar so I could try not to think about this whole thing and got drunk, so I ended up at her place, she, while still tipsy, told me I was crazy and my husband was right. This surprised me because she supported me when she was sober, but I think this is her true opinion.\n\nThis morning he texted me 100 times asking if I had come to my senses.

It almost always sets you up for immediately looking for something better, which isn\u2019t what you want when you buy your home. \n\nOn another note, your husband is way wrong for getting so upset and angry he made you fearful. Not ok. That\u2019s an even bigger issue to contemplate than the house, imo.", "NTA. The back up around the elementary school when my kids were there was crazy.

That's a reasonable position to have.\n\nFor your husband, the school is basically irrelevant, and the house is ideal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I think you might be wrong. You don't want kids, so presumably you expect to have a full-time job, which means that at the times when parents are dropping off and picking up their kids from school, you aren't home. So I'd really ask yourself whether this actually affects you as much as you think.", "ESH. This has nothing to do with whether you should buy the house and everything to do with the fact that you guys don't know how to resolve marital disputes in a healthy manner. Screaming matches, running off, getting drunk and failing to come home are not the way.  And on the bright side (for Jon at least, because this is his money), if you don't buy the house and end up divorcing, he can buy it on his own.", "NTA Large purchases should be agreed upon by both.", "Nta But neither is he. \nYou might want to compromise or yiu will end up alone.", "ESH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a decades long investment.

It's also valid to not see that as a big deal. But buying a house is a two-yes, one-no situation. You both need to be on the same page or it's not going to work out.\n\nSo no one is an asshole for disagreeing on the house. Where you both are assholes is the fact that this disagreement escalated into a shouting match that led to you running off to get drunk with a friend.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, there's room for the two of you to argue and disagree without escalating to screams, shouts, threats and drinking. The two of you don't need to be in lockstep, but screaming at each other over which house to buy is frankly distressing to even think about.", "ESH\n\nIf you guys are married then getting a house should a group decision that shouldn't be a screaming match. Compromise should be a thing as well, and it looks like you aren't giving any leeway whatsoever either.", "ESH, you both clearly need to work on communication without yelling or getting drunk. You have the right not to want to live by a school. Have him read AITA, there are plenty of nightmare stories here to support you.

But our area is growing.  We need more schools.  It was decided that land was being under utilized.  The farm was just big enough to fit a physical school.

That doesn\u2019t mean your objections should override all the negatives of the other options, but he needs to consider them. However it sounds like it\u2019s the only house that has everything he wants, so you in turn need to understand that. \n\nThere\u2019s always another house. But if you\u2019re determined to buy now, and if you guys absolutely positively cannot come to an agreement, then he should probably buy it. Maybe he\u2019ll sell it in a few years when he gets sick of the school. It\u2019s just a house.", "And games", "I lived across from a school in Chicago for 6 years, but the school wasn\u2019t super big so it didn\u2019t cause me any issues, but a big school sounds horribly inconvenient and relentless.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be school events being held there on the off days. Here in Georgia taxpayers are allowed to use the playgrounds since it\u2019s taxpayer dollars funding the school and the upkeep. At any given time except during school hrs you see families on the school playgrounds.", "I mean she says it turned into a screaming match which implies to me that she was screaming too.  Sounds like neither of them know how to handle martial disagreements in a healthy manner.", "Oh of course.  That is why I said NTA.\n\nIt is just an extra point to consider.  None of that money is hers.", "It\u2019s ridiculous. I recognize that some parents have something to get to shortly after school lets out but it feels ridiculous to waste hours every day in the name of saving time in the line.", "Fair, but I'm not sure living next to a school is better.", "NTA Ask hubby to take 3 days off, and stand close to the house during morning dropoff, lunchtime (bells), afternoon pickup & while kids walk home - 1 hr at least each time.  If that doesn't convince him he's nuts. Just leaving to go to work through that traffic & buses would be a PITA. Oh, and kids will feel free to cut through your yard or litter.\n\nMaybe he's very excited and anxious to be in a home, but location should always be a serious consideration.", "I live by a school. The little assholes steal my deliveries sometimes. NTA", "NTA. Tell him to buy his house, but you won't be joining him. Yelling at you when he doesn't get his way is a huge red flag. And FTR, I wouldn't want to live across from any of the schools in my town. And I've had 2 kids go thru and i love my town.", "NTA I live across the street from a high school, it took me 39 minutes to turn into my own driveway. Living next to this school is a nightmare and I regret it daily. There is literally no benefits living by a school.", "NTA I live a block and a half from a middle school. I constantly hear the coaches yelling on their bullhorns. I wouldn\u2019t want to live any closer.\n\nHowever, you have a big problem in your relationship. You were so frightened of your husband that you needed to leave. Instead of continuing to search until you find a house you both like, he is attempting to bully you into buying this one.", "Yes, living right by a school sucks.\n\nBut what really concerns me is how nuclear this argument got. Keep looking at houses, you'll find one that makes both of you happy.", "I once lived on a street that had a high school, primary school AND a kinder on it. \nNo, just no.", "NTA\n\nI have kids and don't want to live next to a school.", "NTA for the incredibly simple reason that *two people buying a house together need to 100% agree on the house*. It's that simple.", "NTA. I don\u2019t have kids, but I\u2019ve been a delivery driver since 2017, and let me say\u2026. Delivering to houses near/by schools is a fucking NIGHTMARE. AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. Between kids just darting into the road at random, to asshole parents driving like, well, /assholes/, school are no bueno.\n\nNot to mention that the houses I\u2019d deliver to were always fucked with in some capacity by the kids- garbage everywhere, things stolen\u2026 Schools are just a nightmare OP.", "NTA but like others, I\u2019m concerned with his reaction. It\u2019s way over the top.  Also, did it ever occur to him that there might be a reason this \u201cdream house\u201d is so affordably priced when all the others you\u2019ve seen have less bedrooms and/or are more expensive?", "NTA- why have a dream home if you won\u2019t be able to even enjoy it?", "NTA\n\nThere have to be other homes around.  Put the money in an interest gaining acount and  keep looking. \n\nLiving next to a school would be awful.", "Plus all those fumes from idling cars, ick.", "I work in a school. I wait about half an hour after dismissal before leaving because I know I will never get out onto the main road due to the traffic from parents", "OMG -- Somehow I avoided the BLARE of the marching band. Yes, there is more trash than folks can imagine. LOL \\~ your post; it brightened my day and your validation is appreciated.", "Inheriting a fortune can actually be extremely stressful at first.  Not that it excuses his behavior.", "The kids in my neighborhood are not allowed to walk onto or off campus either alone or with parents. You have to be picked up in a car or leave on the bus and the layout was not designed for it. It\u2019s awful, especially since everything for almost a mile in 3 directions is walkable neighborhood.", "NTA\n\nBuying a house is a huge commitment, and you have every reason to not want to live next to a school. Doesn't  he know about your past experiences?", "NTA, noise aside, the traffic around the school must be a nightmare in the mornings and in the afternoons. I currently live near a school, the noise doesn't bother me because I'm at work during school hours and even if I were at home, the noise is not that noticeable having the windows closed, but there are a lot of cars on the street in the mornings and in the afternoons when school time ends.", "Suggest that you go view it again at drop off and pick up time and also at a break time so he can hear and see how annoying it is", "NTA. On top of all the things listed, how old is the school? Upgrades may be done that may affect student count, pick up, sporting, etc. which would affect your home. I grew up next to a school and we weren\u2019t close enough for drop off to be an issue for us. However, about 10 years into living there, the school ripped out their track and installed 3 new baseball fields with lighting. The baseball team would practice until 10pm and the lights shined into our bedroom window. Living next to a school is only convenient if you want/love children. I do think you both need to learn to communicate better if your expectations/wants haven\u2019t been heard by each other this far into your relationship.", "NTA this is his dream house, not yours. Doesn't matter the reasons, that's the bottom line.\n\nIf you've been looking awhile and you keep rejecting homes I'd say you had to compromise on something, but it sounds like you're at the beginning of looking. \n\nThere will be a better home out there if you're patient.", "I grew up next to a school. Don't recommend esp if you don't plan on having kids. You can probably get a nice house somewhere further away from the school. It's cheap because it's next to a school with all the issues that come with it.", "I would recommend OP and her boyfriend to visit the school for about half an hour before school starts and for an hour after school ends (if they can even get onto the street)", "Eminent domain is just evil :( I hope you have the tow truck company  on speed dial.", "I once visited a friend who lives near a school close to end of day. Kids everywhere, just wandering across the road as they pleased, the kind of traffic that would have made you think it was peak hour on the freeway. It was one half-hour experience and I remember it years later. Idk why anyone would submit themselves to that, even if they had school aged kids and it was the best school in town.", "have you ever strongly disagreed with something he wanted to do?\n\nyou say \"at least not at me\"..... who has he gotten this upset with", "HOAs aren\u2019t *great,* and I can perfectly understand why you don\u2019t want to live in a neighborhood with one. However, I think this would be a worthwhile trade-off if a similarly dream home-worthy house exists inside of an HOA, *depending on the HOA.* I live inside one, and they\u2019re generally pretty chill. I can definitely tell you it\u2019s better than living close to a school! NTA.", "I had to pick two kids up at school and then drive a half hour back home to get two kids off the bus. I was definitely one of those parents in the pick up line at 2p even though school let out at 3:10. I had to or I'd be late to the bus stop. But it was actually all right because I was taking online classes at the time and my lectures usually coincided with my driving times. I just couldn't turn the camera on the zoom", "Easy ESH.\n\nIt's a simple difference of opinion.\n\nI've lived next to school, it's really no big deal.\n\nBut you're having screaming matches over this!?\n\nSpend some money on marriage counselling first.", "NTA used to have a garden that backed onto a school. Nightmare! Your husband is crazy", "NTA my best friend lives next to a daycare and that alone is a nightmare.   Some kids just like screaming the entire time they're outside.", "NTA\n\nThis is not your dream home due to the location, end of story", "NTA.  I used to live on the road parallel to the road where the school was, kind of backing up to the school, and it was still a nightmare.  Between like 7 and 8, and then 2:30 and 4, the road was a mess, because of parents doing pickup.  I mean stopped traffic.  I would have an easier time driving through the 20 turns in the neighborhood at 5mph to get to a different exit, then driving out the main exit by my house to CROSS THE ROAD to the highway.  Literally, just across the road.  People would park and crowd the entrance to wait for their kids, it was insane.  Bad on weekends too, because of sports games, school carnivals, fundraisers.  The houses right by the school?  People were always parking directly in their driveways, standing on their lawns, tossing trash.  People are animals.  \n\nIf you had kids or were planning on having kids, I could see wanting to live so close - MAYBE - but other than that, no way, no how.", "ESH. You're NTA for not wanting to live next to a school, but you're TA for how you handle disagreements with your husband, and so is he. It seems like you both need to learn how to calmly use your words like adults. He doesn't get to unilaterally decide where you both live, but leaving an argument to go get trashed and stay out all night is not an ok way to deal with an issue. I've never understood couples that leave during disagreements or play silent treatment for days. I understand taking a break from the conversation and cooking back to it after a cool down. If you honestly felt scared of him during the argument and that's why you left, I don't see why you're married to him at all.", "NTA. Make him come with you to have a look at what pick up time looks like. And then remind him that's 80% of the year for the next 50 years. He's being ridiculous.", "NTA I have lived next door to an infant junior school and then across the road from a 16 to 18 year old 6th form with the side entrance to an infant school. We also lived in a house that the garden backed on to the school's field. My husband set off for work long before the cars arrived dropping kids off for school and the chattering of mums standing talking. But by the 5 or 10 minutes past the chattering of mums have gone. At the 6th form the teenagers walked or drove in and not that many cars dropped them off. Then all is very quiet all day until it starts again at pick up time. I tended to make sure I was out or back in again before these times to avoid some idiot blocking the driveway.  Little kids do get out the car and run onto people's front gardens. We had a brick wall and gate when we lived next door to the one school, which mitigated this. Teachers are usually intelligent, logical, especially the head teacher. They care about the safety and reputation of the school. They tend to make very good, safe neighbours outside of the arrival and departure times. They care about the neighbourhood of the school being safe for their kids. They are very community aware. We have deliberately chosen to be by schools because our first house was in a dodgy area and I was stalked there really bad. We just happened to move near a school after that to get away. Then realised actually schools are hyper aware of creeps hanging about and strange cars. We actually found schools far more predictable neighbours as to behaviour than other neighbours. So would I move that close to a school again? Yes I would for a short disruption of time that can be predicted over a nasty neighbour that cant. it this is UK and there are a lot of kids who walk over USA huge amount of cars coming in.", "NTA. Living next to a school is a noisy nightmare!", "NTA.

Absolutely awful,  your husband needs educating, sit him outside the school at home time so he can see and hear exactly what it is like.", "YTA, for one reason. This is his inheritance, not yours. He can buy whatever house he wants. Nobody says you have to live there. I hope he knows better than comingling his inheritance with his/your assets. You mention pay check to pay check... An expensive house has many expenses. Taxes, Insurance and maintenance. I sure hope that has been figured into the budget for life. If you and him were sharing a house payment, then NTA because each of you should have equal say.", "NTA! It\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to deal with every weekday. There\u2019s some roads I avoid around drop-off and pick-up time for the kids because the streets get chocked full of cars and kids. I\u2019d never want to live near a school unless I worked there", "NTA. There will be another house not near a school", "I grew up living across the road from a school and in the radius of 5 schools in 5km.\n\nThe Saturday hockey matches and fund raising walks were my killer. I don't care about the fact that the WACKY WATERMELONS scored a goal at 7:30am. I don't wanna hear it screamed over a loudspeaker.\n\nI do care about the line of parents parked IN our driveway and get out their cars to have a 15 min chinwag with the teacher and 12 parents, then their kid needs 25 books signed. Then try and do a 8 point turn across 4 lanes of traffic. All while I'm trying to leave for work.\n\nParents on a school run are the MOST inconsiderate people in the universe. I will never live near a school again.", "I live near a school that doesn't have adequate parking so a lot of the teachers park in my street, because there are no time limits.

He can do what he wants and buy a house wherever he wants with his money, but OP shouldn\u2019t go live there with him if he has such nasty reactions to genuine complaints from his wife. He sounds abusive.", "Hahaha! I\u2019m between 2 schools, a church and a baseball park.\n\nI heal all kinds of bells, yells and music and deal with traffic.\n\nSummers are heaven though.\n\nThe garbage is what pisses me off the most though.
