Run. He made his bed and no amount of your effort can save him. Maybe you giving up on him will be a wake up call, but I doubt it. Save yourself.", "NTA at all. I'd leave him hanging simply for the money thing. He's taking advantage of you and you're wondering whether getting fed up with his atrocious behavior will make you an asshole. He's not going to fail if you aren't there. He's going to fail because he's a jerk who doesn't take his education seriously. It will not be your fault at all. Do not feel guilty about this.", "NTA.  He isn't helping himself. He's perfectly ok with stealing from his mom. Why WOULD you want to help him?", "HELL NO, let that dude fail.", "You are not there to be his emotional labourer. And you\u2019re doing your own school work. I think out of respect for the friendship, you could give him 1 single heads up that you think he\u2019s an arsehole for his actions, and that you are not prepared to help him, if he doesn\u2019t see the error of his ways, but otherwise, NTA", "NTA-have respect for yourself and only associate with people who respect you.", "NTA. like they say On the airplanes, put your own mask on first before helping anyone else. \n\nIf someone is disrespecting your assistance then they don\u2019t value it. Often people who receive something for free do not value it.", "NTA- Stop wasting your time on a loser.", "NTA. You are not responsible for his school performance, you are not letting him fail if you aren't busting your butt 10 hours every day to push him.", "NTA\n\nLet that greedy idiot fail", "Nta \n\nI wouldn't mind helping a friend for free, but if they get money from their mom for u, cuz she's thankful that ur helping her son and he just spends it himself, that's selfish and he probably doesn't realise how much effort ur putting into him", "NTA  Demand 200%.  He's not in a position to negotiate and he's already stolen money that was supposed to go to you.", "WNBTA, that friend is being a greedy A-hole and you stopping the support will be a good wake-up call", "NTA. His grades are not your responsibility. You are both adults, technically\u2014after high school he will have to get a job. He won\u2019t be able to rely on friends to do all his work for him, unpaid, at a job, like you\u2019ve been doing in school. And he\u2019s not magically going to learn how to be responsible for his work after graduation; he will still be the same person with or without the diploma. He doesn\u2019t even really understand the magnitude of what you\u2019ve been doing for him because he is so insistent that you not be compensated whatsoever for full time tutoring. \n\nStop putting in all this extra work for someone who\u2019s just taking advantage of you. He\u2019s going to have to learn how to be a responsible adult someday, and it\u2019s going to be a rough transition for him because he\u2019s just been coasting so far. It\u2019s not your job to drag him across the finish line of high school just so he can fail again at working. Let him figure it out for himself.", "NTA, he's using you. He's handing you a bouquet of red flags...don't treat them like flowers. See them for what they are. ADHD isn't a reason to fail, it's a calculated excuse for him.", "Nta, tell his mom he\u2019s gonna fail and vapes with the money she gave him for you. He needs a rude awakening about how that kind of behavior is abhorrent, and possibly why he\u2019s failing class.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s a mental illness, that\u2019s once again a discussion for mom to take on, not you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
