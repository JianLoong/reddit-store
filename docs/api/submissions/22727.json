(myself included). If you're fit then you look good , if you're fat, the majority of people would not consider you attractive, or even worse you develop various health problems. Why is so difficult for people to accept the objective reality and try to fight or avoid it so much? At the end of the day is a trait of your body, if you are blonde and someone points out you're blonde, you wouldn't get offended.", "Not where I thought this was going based on the title lol. \n\nNTA tho. Obviously.", "If we eliminate the shame of weight, then conversations about weight are benign.", "NTA - accountability is kryptonite for some people.", "NTA you care for her and are trying to look after her well being.", "It's hard to say, 25 is usually a time when dietary and exercise habits start to really reflect in a woman's (and a man's) appearance.  Prior to that people can just be thin because they are young.  By 25 you start to see the people who haven't built the skills or lack the desire to take the steps to remain fit.\n\nSo it may be the munchies, but it could also just be her general lifestyle.", "YTA\u2026 it\u2019s not the weed that\u2019s making her gain weight. She is obviously using food to deal with stress. You bringing her weight up could just make the situation worse. If you\u2019re not happy with someone that gains weight easy. Then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be with her. If you actually loved her you wouldn\u2019t care if she gained a little weight. I\u2019d say it\u2019s time for you to move on and maybe think about what you actually want. Cause if you\u2019re not okay with a female gaining weight you\u2019re in for a world of misery. Everyone ends up gaining weight at some point.", "Soft YTA because there are many possible reasons for weight gain and it's not your place to act as an authority on what parts of her lifestyle are contributing to it. \n\nYou say you don't care that she smokes weed, but also that when she's high it's \"not your favourite thing\" - which one is it? \n\nIf you really wanted to help her, you could suggest going to the gym together or ordering healthier takeout options or cooking at home more, rather than throw out a judgement on her lifestyle which seems to be motivated by your own hang-ups about her smoking.", "NTA. She raised the topic, you gave an honest answer that wasn\u2019t nasty or insulting. She doesn\u2019t want to hear it.", "NTA - Your GF isn't very bright if she can't connect the dots between stuffing copious amounts of food in her face to weight gain.", "NTA. I don't know why she asked if she didn't want to hear the answer.", "NTA\n\nIt's called \"the munchies\". Food marches in formation into your mouth, there is no defence!!!! other than to not smoke weed and eat junk.\n\nStock up on carrot sticks (or just carrots and some sort of spicy dipping stuff (low to no calories). \n\nAlternatively, make icecubes with her favorite flavorings. Eating 30 spicy icecubes per day may help weight loss. It may also lead to suffering from exposure.", "ESH....While you weren't mean about what you said, you don't know why she's gaining weight. You really should have told her to speak with her doctor. The doctor likely would have told her the same thing you did, but it would have \"sounded better\" coming from a medical professional.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you were insensitive about it, she probably needs to at least hear that perspective once.", "NTA but shes got an obvious addiction prob that shes in denial about, its gonna get worse and you cant save her.", "NTA but, Smoking isn\u2019t causing her to gain weight lol. It\u2019s her inability to stop using food as a coping mechanisms. She\u2019s using the smoking as an excuse for why she\u2019s hungry when she\u2019s just in her self loathing cycle of eat, feel and about being fat, eat to feel better, feel worse from gain, repeat. She can smoke but u need to slow her consumption lol. I know a lot of thin people who smoke and don\u2019t gain weight or have eatting problems? Don\u2019t blame \u201cthe smoking\u201d for her inability to stop eatting.", "Woof, a complicated situation to be put in but definitely nta.", "NTA- You told her the truth and it was not what she wanted to hear.

As long as there is no judgement tied to it and she brings it up, why not suggest it is the food intake with weed? \n\nIf she brings it up while sober again, you can always try something like \"honey, I love you no matter what. You are beautiful right now. If you are concerned about changes in your weight, which you keep bringing up, the only change I've seen is that you tend to binge while smoking. It could also be affecting your metabolism. If there's anything I can do it you want to try, I'll help, but that's all I'm going to say.\"\n\nMy husband and sons have an insane metabolism, they can eat constantly and it makes no difference. However, I have to be very measured in what I eat both quantity and type of food. One of the reasons I don't smoke weed is because I get very hungry and my ability to control what I eat is reduced.", "NTA you were just pointing out a pattern of behavior she may not have been conscious of", "I was all ready to tear you a new one, but NTA.", "NTA. How much weed does she smoke to have no idea that she's eating a bunch of junk food? Or to have no idea that eating a bunch of junk food might ... I don't know ... cause her to get fat?", "NTA\n\nShe knew it anyway. If she would get high to a point she doesn't remember her junk food attack anymore the next day, this would be concerning.", "NTA. No one would call you out if your meth head girlfriend was asking why she's so skinny.", "nta, she just doesn't want to hear it. She can get around the munchies by eating before smoking and making better snack choices. You may also want to be more active when you are together just because you are a large chunk of her free time. Even if you're just fucking more, it's activity.", "NTA. She's clearly eating more and not as active because she's now smoking a lot. Period.", "NTA. She asked and you told her the hard truth.

Maybe your girlfriend will do the same? She's upset about her weight gain, and she likely needs to process it and why it's happening. I don't see anything wrong with what you did, if I asked someone why I thought I was gaining weight and they said I wasn't as active as I was before or was eating more, then that's probably why. They wouldn't be saying it to be mean, they'd be saying it to answer my question, which is what you did. You don't seem to have problems with her gaining weight, just smoking weed before seeing you all the time, which is a fair thing to not be happy about. *She's*  the one bringing it up, *she's*  the one who asked you, all you did was answer her question. \n\nI think you should be allowed to, and just should in general, try to talk to your girlfriend about her weed consumption and how you don't like her being high around you all the time, that's something partners should be allowed to communicate. And if that works, then she would be smoking it less, which might decrease the things she's unhappy about, like weight gain and less physical ability.\n\nUltimately it's your relationship though, so think about how you want to go about this. I don't think you were in the wrong about this, but it sounds like you two need to have a conversation or two, I'm rooting for you both dude.", "Unfortunately (weed consumer here) it actually slows down your metabolism; especially since she is less active now. Not to mention your metabolism starts to slow down at that age. I don't believe you're the AH in this situation. I had to be up front with myself when I began regularly smoking that it slowed me down if I let it and had to be on top of controlling my snacking habits and exercise. It's an easy habit to get stuck in but I had made rules for myself about eating when I'm elevated, like only fruits and veggies and I have to work out on days I smoke. She doesn't have to do anything but maybe play around with adjusting her lifestyle accordingly.", "Well yeah she's feeling insecure about her body.

You seem to be seriously overgeneralising women with this comment.", "Man, you replied *WAY*  faster than I thought you would. I swear I *just*  got off and you replied to me! Haha!", "No I think he said the right thing.... I just read a lot of reddit and have seen YTAs where guys suggest exactly that and get their heads ripped off both by the person and the comments. \n\nWhy do you think people apply \"fat shaming\" to literally everything.
