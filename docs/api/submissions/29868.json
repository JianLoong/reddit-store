To be clear, I (22f) have absolutely no training for doing hair, but within the last year or two I've gotten really into coloring/cutting my own. I tend to change it every few months and I've gotten pretty damn good at it despite being self taught. \n\nI've dyed and cut bangs for another friend of ours before and didn't think anything of saying yes.  All I ask is that they pay for materials and maybe smoke me up or get a pizza or something for the labor. That particular friend is incredibly chill and went into the process with realistic expectations. Those being that I'm ultimately winging this shit, armed with nothing but Manic Panic and the first pair of hair scissors that come up when you search them on Amazon. \n\nThe problem is, the friend I'm talking about now is...not like that. She was warned well before we got started that I'm not a professional and I'm doing this for free. While she was a little nervous, she still wanted to do it. Okay! Great!\n\nYeah, so not great. I know I'm an idiot for not saying no. I'm well aware of how high strung she can be and should have seen it coming a mile away the second she told me that she wanted to go platinum. Said friend has very dark hair naturally and going that light takes a lot. She was also told this before anything was done. Again, she still wanted me to do it. I've done platinum hair for myself in the past so she trusted me. \n\nThe bleaching went fine. No problems at all. For anybody that doesn't know, your hair usually isn't the perfect blonde you want the second you rinse. My friend's hair was predictably very brassy afterward, For fucks sake, we were going from almost black. Maybe it's a knowledge gap on my end but I don't see how it could have turned out otherwise. And that's fine! I had a toner for a platinum color and purple shampoo ready to go. \n\nWe never got to use those. She threw an absolute fit at how it looked after just the bleaching and accused me of ruining her hair. Wouldn't listen to a word I had to say about the next steps to get it to the color she wanted. We fought about it for a bit before she decided that she was going to go to a salon to have them fix it and that I was going to be the one to pay for them to do it. \n\nWhich was not going to happen and I told her so. Even if I had actually botched it, I couldn't afford to pay for her to get it fixed. There was a bit more arguing and ultimately she refused to let me apply the toner before leaving. \n\nTo be honest, it probably wouldn't have been exactly what she wanted even if we'd gotten that far. When I did that color for myself, I was working with much lighter hair. I very well could be an asshole for agreeing to do this in the first place when there wasn't 100% certain that I could. I should have also probably offered to kick in what money I could for her to go to a professional for no other reason than trying to preserve the friendship.

You have to know the % peroxide for the hair type and how long you can safely use it. I have bleached both my brown fine hair, and my boyfriends very course black hair.

Why on earth would you want to preserve the friendship?", "NTA\n\nShe sounds like she has unrealistic expectations and should go to a professional salon, and pay what they charge.", "NTA- toner will help with the brassy, so will purple shampoo/ conditioner.", "ESH - There are licensing requirements for cosmetologists for a reason. You shouldn\u2019t be doing hair. By doing not for free you weren\u2019t breaking the law (most likely) but you really should be careful. She sucks for expecting you to know what you were doing.", "NTA. I have very dark hair, and I wanted to get it entirely bleached, and it cost me about $300 to do it at a professional salon. it looked nice for a single process, but I won't be doing that again lol. I've bleached it myself since then, and after about 3 sessions, I was able to get it to look pretty close to the salon results. it took time and effort. either she's... dense/ignorant, or she was trying to pull something. there's a saying though, always assume ignorance as opposed to malice or something like that, so let's just hope she just didn't know what she was doing and freaked out. it is a big change, after all, especially for a dye noobie. don't let her make you pay for it though, you did nothing wrong. perhaps don't do this again though, unless it's someone who has any experience with the process just looking for extra helping hands. I've also got experience bleaching/dying my hair, with plenty of mistakes to learn from, but I can't imagine bleaching someone else's. too scary. I much prefer to ruin my own hair lmao, I'm fine with potentially having to buzz it all off and pretend that's what I was planning anyways. \ud83e\udd37\n\nat best, offer to help her either dye it back to original, or dye it some fun or new color. it will still look good after all, though perhaps not as vibrant.\n\nbest of luck!", "ESH - I cut and color my hair and have cut and colored other people's hair, but I know my limitations. I don't do anything that would require precision coloring or cause damage that I can't fix.\n\nThat said, you should know your limitations and just refuse to do anything unless you're willing to put in the time to learn a bit more advanced than the basics.\n\nThere is so much that could go wrong and cause actual harm. For instance, you could leave the bleach on too long and cause painful scalp burn. You could over bleach and cause the hair to break all over. \n\nThe MOST dangerous is that could cause an allergic reaction and they could be sent to the hospital. Google hair color reaction to see.\n\nI'm not saying you can't experiment and have fun with friends, but you also need to choose wisely.\n\nI only offer to bleach and color people's hair if they want some bright or vibrant Manic Panic color. If they want a platinum blonde or gray, I won't be able to deliver that without fear of fucking up their hair (again, breakage or not using the right toner).\n\n-----\nSo, here are a few tips I've learned over the years that might help you out on the future:\n\n1) Do an allergy test. On yourself if you're using new colors (you basically place a small bit on your skin and water 24 hours - but Google instructions per the brand).\n\n2) Prevent scalp burn by brushing on bleach on about 1 cm from the root. Wait about half the process time you normally would and then place the rest of the bleach at the root - the roots will not get as light as the rest of the hair, but it won't be as noticeable as no bleach.)\n\n3) To tone your hair, you need to learn the basics of the color wheel. Bluish tones knock out orange tones, while purple knocks out the yellow tones. (If you mix opposite colors on the color wheel, you get a grayish color.) Purple shampoo doesn't make blond whiter - it grays the blonde, so it looks like a light gray, which seems whiter.\n\n4) Using 30 vol to bleach hair and 10 vol to add toners that require it. Those toners will usually say, but also know there's a whole science in finding the right color. Black hair, for instance, bleaches out more orange, but everyone is different.", "In addition to this, even with salon products to get from dark brown/black your hair has to go through red first to then get to yellow then platinum.  A lot of the time hairdressers will prepare dark haired clients with the knowledge that this process could take up to 3-4 times to get to the colour they want", "Honestly, it sounds like she\u2019s trying to get her friend (OP) to help bankroll the MASSIVE expense of transitioning from dark hair (black no less!) to blonde. Sorry that she has buyer\u2019s remorse, NTA", "Totally. My boyfriend has very thick black hair and insists on basically making it white. I've been using 40% and saying we should redp in 6 weeks. Nope. He wants it right now. Yes his hair looks like shit. A 20 min development is now almost an hour", "Exactly this! It took my colorist 4 times at $150 each to get my dark hair light. Watching people bleach their own hair scares me every time!", "Exactly! Anyone who\u2019s done it (stylist or client) knows that there are no instant results, it\u2019s a transition", "I won\u2019t say you were an AH necessarily but it really was not a smart thing to do with no professional experience and this is coming from someone who has been bleaching and dying their hair since I was 12 and I just turned 43 a couple weeks ago. Going from even medium brown to platinum is something that will take months when done correctly if you don\u2019t want either horribly blotchy orange hair or hair that\u2019s so incredibly damaged it just breaks off. That was just a dumb idea all around so I guess I would say ESH.", "NTA. I don\u2019t THINK this was pre-meditated, because I\u2019ve had similar experiences where I ask for one thing (a hair color I was in the past with photos of me with said hair color) and it\u2019s nothing like it at the end. I still pay and tip, because the service was still provided, and the person (a friend) did her best. \n\nI understand her panic going from near black to brassy blonde- but if she had done any research, she\u2019d know that getting to platinum hair requires that stepping stone. \n\nI would not pay her requested salon fee, and tbh after this, the friendship would be soured to me.", "NTA  \nShe knows exactly what your qualifications are (aren't?). She then quit half way through the process and wants to blame you. Any chance that this was her plan all along? It seems odd that she didn't let you finish, she has no clue how it would have ended up and still she stormed out and wants you to pay up.   \nMaybe it wouldn't have been perfect but still OK.   \nDo you really want to preserve this relationship?", "Your friend sucks.\n\nNTA", "NTA, babe. I have Asian black hair, I\u2019ve gone platinum, white, grey, and that is a process that involves hours, if not days. I\u2019ve never bleached my own hair and every single colorist has had that momentary look of \u201cOH S#!T\u201d.", "NTA. Reddit really makes me sad because all these people want to know if they're being an asshole for completely reasonable things. Is there that much gaslighting or doubting going around?", "NTA.\n\nWhen I was 20, my best friend gave me a haircut. It was terrible: blunt, choppy, uneven and way too short. But I just laughed with her. And I laughed in the stylist chair at the cheap chain salon the next day as she gave me a bob I didn't want, but it evened out the disaster-cut. \n\nMy friend had no idea how to cut my hair, but I forgave her. I knew before we started that it could go badly.\n\nAnyways we're still friends now. She's a doctor and has made many cuts - and sewn up- many messy situations. She was in the room giving advice as I labored. And she cuts her own hair into very precise styles. I'm lucky we're still friends many years later. But I won't have her cut my hair again.\n\nYou just have to embrace learning experiences. I learned about making boundaries with friends and trusting my own intuition. She learned there are lots of hair textures, and was humbled a bit. Maybe she learned something else, I will have to ask her.\n\nAnyways. Being your age is all about learning and finding a way to balance humility with experimenting. Don't let this knock you back.", "NTA - she got what she paid for", "Never a great idea to play kitchen beautician.", "NTA. Your friend learned a valuable lesson - you get what you pay for.", "NTA. I have really coarse natural black hair and used to dye it platinum when I was younger. Holy shit, it was quite a process the first time and every time that I had to do my roots after.\n\nHad to bleach it twice, each time took 45 minutes, and then apply platinum toner and purple shampoo. My hair survived the process quite ok, but I had to use a lot of conditioner on it so it didn't look completely broken.\n\nI'm glad to go with my natural color nowadays. Dying natural black is a pain in the ass.", "ESH but mostly her.\nYou're right, you should never have agreed to do this.\nBut Friend had unrealistic expectations, even after you told her it would be hard to get her hair the color she wanted, and you don't owe her anything. \n\nI myself have very dark hair which I like to dye light blonde. As a teenager I did a few bleach jobs of my own thar never looked right. Finally I realized the value in seeing a professional. I now have an amazing hairstylist who balayages my hair so the roots look better as they grow in. Last time she was explaining why it would take several sessions to get the dimension I wanted and it really is very complicated. Not everyone can just grab a box of dye at the grocery store and have their hair come out the color on the box.", "NTA. If she goes into it knowing you're self-taught, then it's on her, especially since she didn't wait for the end product.\n\nMy friend goes from dark brown to ash blonde easily but has trouble finding someone willing to go platinum.\n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you. My cynical take is that you can't expect to remain friends with her after this because she's so irrational.", "NTA You told her you weren't a professional and then she spazzed out. That's on her.", "Agree with this, NTA"]}
