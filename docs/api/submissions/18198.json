I feel so riddled with guilt for not knowing about them and doing something so much sooner. I had (and still do) have my MIL muted on facebook. We have differing opinions politically and she's rather vocal about it in her Facebook posts so rather than deal with it I muted her. I did not think I had to babysit a 53 yr old woman's Facebook to make sure she was intelligent enough not to post naked photos and video of my at the time 1 yr old naked in the bath. We had previously agreed that she couldn't post anything in Facebook that we hadn't sent to her. My husband sent her the photo and video but presumably thought that it went without saying NOT TO POST THEM as weve told her in the past no nude or even photos of the kids in just a diaper can be posted online. Recently, I forget the circumstances that lead me to checking her Facebook page, found the photos and immediately texted her and told her they needed to be taken down immediately and that she was no longer allowed to post photos of my children online. I also mentioned that I also had found photos she had taken and posted during visits and while we were living with them without asking my husband and I. I told her I also had a problem with that. In response to my message with read about on par with a stern corporate email (we've had problem before with her thinking I am aggressive and mean and I didn't want to add fuel to the fire dispite being PISSED) she did take the images and video down. However she did turn around and complain to my husband about how rude and disrespectful I was over something that had gone without issue for over a year. I wasn't privy to the conversation but my husband is now upset with me because I should have asked her to take them down and not demanded. He wants me to now apologize to her about all of this. I was so sure of myself before he demanded I apologize regardless of whether or not a mean it. I'm now having some doubts as well as a huge feeling of betrayal from my husband. She posted nude photos and videos of out child on the internet for all her 300+ \"friends\" to see. Those photos and video are now who knows where being used in potentially horrific ways and yet I'm the asshole in this? Because I didn't politely ask for her to fix something that never should have happened in the first place? I don't understand which in the words of my husband is part of my problem.

Let them know that naked pictures and videos of small children are posted without their parents' consent, and FB will very likely take them down pretty damned fast.  \n\nMeanwhile, your husband's support of his awful mother over his reasonable wife is very troubling.

That's so dangerous and disturbing. Gah, I'm just.... That pissed me smooth the fuck off!", "NTA in any way shape or form. Your number one priority as a parent is to protect your children\u2026 she wasn\u2019t keeping your children safe by posting nude photos of them online.", "Didn't even read past the headline, NTA. Not only is it inappropriate but it's incredibly illegal despite her intentions and she could absolutely go to prison for that (assuming US)", "Nta. In fact I dare say you under reacted. She posted explicit photos and videos of a minor child....can that be call pornography ?

I don\u2019t blame you at all. It\u2019s explicit photos of a minor. But it\u2019s a weird thing that naked baby pictures are kinda normalized to some people.. it\u2019s fucked up. Would she post them naked at 8yo? What\u2019s the cut off for naked kid pictures being ok??? It should never be okay. Even a fresh out of the womb naked baby picture would be weird to post\u2026 especially in the world now a days and the stories you hear of babies that young being abused in certain ways.

That's super gross of your MIL, and if I did apologize, it would be along the lines of \"I am sorry that I didn't see the photos immediately and report you to Facebook for posting illegal, nude photos of MY CHILD.\"\n\nNo more pictures or videos for MIL.

She and your husband sound enmeshed and codependent. That means your husband will continue to take her side and enable her toxic and controlling behavior (grody). I would have a serious convo with your husband about how how he needs to stand up for you and stand WITH you when enforcing boundaries with his mother. You and him are the unit. You are the team. You are partners. You should have each others back. Just my thoughts based on your post, but forgive me if I am way off-base!", "NTA - Unfortunately those images have already been uploaded and who knows where they've been saved.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is upset you hurt his mommy for being inappropriate which is a red flag.

Eventually, they'll grow up and will probably be grateful that their private photos weren't left up online where anyone could see. Teens can be sensitive about that stuff, for example, and you're protecting their right to choose how to deal with these photos in the future, when they're old enough to make the decision about what's cute to share versus what they'd rather keep private.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA!!!!!!!!! \n\nYour kid, your rules. If she wants to see your kid again she'll follow your rules. Also, a casual mention about reporting her to Facebook might also be warranted to make sure she knows to follow your rules about your kid lest she end up banned from Facebook.\n\nYour husband however is all kinds of wrong here. If this is an agreement between the two of you about your child then he needs to stick to it too. Tell him you're not apologizing because you don't think there is anything for which you need to apologize. Then, if that doesn't make him get his head on straight, book an appointment for marriage counseling because he needs help removing his mother and her tattling from your marriage. He should be standing solidly with you on this, not demanding that you acquiesce to his mother.", "Honestly? YTA.\n\nI get it, you're paranoid as hell that someone might fap to your son's photos... but honestly? That's really, really, really, really, rare.  Odds are you've a better chance of winning the lottery than ever hearing that something like that has happened. Grandparents are the type to take a lot of photos of their grandkids... especially at times where later those photos (and even videos) may be seriously embarrassing.  Lord knows we've all had those moments when our family meet our significant others, and someone drags out that photo of us in our birthday suit, or brings up the story of \"that time\" which causes all of us to go red in the face at both the memory... and the photos.  To put it quite honestly? You are making a mountain out of a mole hill here, and need to breathe a bit, back up and really consider if this is really as 'dangerous' as you make it out to be.  I will tell you one thing, if you're seeing danger behind every picture, every tree, every door... then you're going to be afraid of your own shadow.  Bad things DO happen, yes, and bad PEOPLE are out there, but Facebook? Really?  You're over protective to no end, and need to just chill.  If you're lucky, an apology will solve things. However I don't see that patching things up. Best case, they never talk to you again. Worst case, they decide that dealing with you is too much of a hassle, and your son loses out on interaction with his grandparents.", "YTA.\n\nI mean, every right to be upset about the pictures and need them down. But even in your own story it sounded like you barked an order at her when you could have achieved the same thing with better words.\n\nThe critical part here is that by reacting the way you did, from a place of anger, you missed out on a teaching moment. From a calm place you could have explained and corrected what she did and your point of view, so she better understands what is ok and what is not on social media. The whole explanation that you set strict rules about what she is and isn\u2019t allowed to post, that she followed, but you expected her to think like you and understand and reason to the same conclusion leaves something to improve on.\n\nAs well, I see no acknowledgment that your husband took naked videos of your son and distributed to his mother, or that when you had to set firm rules about what is and isn\u2019t ok, you had her blocked and did not monitor.  You shouldn\u2019t have to but it sounds like it was always going to be something she did wrong. If you are worried about controlling what non naked pics of your kids are posted online, well you will need to police it for everyone. Setting a decree and then closing your eyes isn\u2019t the best approach. Should your husband have not expected this?\n\nIf not for being a parent to a two year old, I may have said NTA, but this shows some areas of improvement for you. Oh boy you will have parallel situations with your child as they age, so practice here. Make peace, even if just for your husband (and to have her as a backup babysitter when you need it)\n\nLastly, at the core is a grandparent who wants to boast and show off their grandchild. As much as you want control, don\u2019t mute what can be a very important and powerful relationship for your child. Take it on the chin and apologize but put some or most of the responsibility and blame on your husband where it belongs and also the ownership for his mothers actions. He took a naked video of your child and shared it without explicitly saying don\u2019t post share or show anyone (when you have had to set rules before with her)? Cmon! It should be his job to police his parent and coach her what is ok and not. If what you think is ok and what he would say is ok are not perfectly aligned, you\u2019re problem is not your MIL.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wouldn't have demanded if the boundary hadn't been crossed to begin with. Something to do with naked photos of my children isn't something I'm going to ask about. Had she ignored bed time? Yea I'd ask but not with something so serious. He knows how I am and knows that was exceedingly nice for how I would have normally handled it yet I'm still being treated like I'm the villain.

OP set some VERY reasonable boundaries about what MIL could and could not post on Facebook. Frankly I think even those rules are pretty lenient, if I had a kid I wouldn\u2019t allow their picture on the internet at all until they were old enough to understand what the internet is and genuinely consent to their pictures being posted, but I digress. OP laid out the ground rules and MIL danced all over them, completely ignoring the rules OP set out regarding HER kid. I repeat, he\u2019s *OP\u2019S* kid *NOT MIL\u2019S* kid.

Also, the kid has a right to privacy and having baby nudes out there isn\u2019t respecting that right to privacy.", "\u201cwhy is it bad to post photos of naked babies on the internet?\u201d is actually an incredibly stupid question", "Tell him that you're concerned that he doesn't seem to get how serious it is.  Sick people trawl the internet looking for pictures like these to fap off to and he's more worried about his mom's feelings?\n\nCouples therapy, I think, would be a good idea.", "NTA! Idc if her Facebook was private and only had family members, you should NEVER post pictures like that of kids on the internet because you never know who might secretly be a predator or if other people are sharing the image and possibly posting for predators to see. Plus if her profile is public (which all FB profiles are by default unless you change in settings and older people may not know) that\u2019s even more people who could\u2019ve seen them. It\u2019s insane to me that this didn\u2019t bother your MIL or your husband. \n\nI also question your husband\u2019s judgement. He probably shouldn\u2019t have sent her pictures like that in the first place and I\u2019m assuming he has his mom on FB and she isn\u2019t muted or blocked so he saw her post them and thought nothing of it. I\u2019d be making sure he understands he\u2019s not to send anything like that (or anything at all since MIL is an idiot) to his mom or they\u2019ll be hell to pay.", "you stayed civil and did your best to protect your kids. giving the benefit of the doubt here, maybe she was too shortsighted to understand the consequences of putting a photo on the internet, who can access it and what they can do with it. maybe it would help to explain that to her.\n\nregardless, i would not apologize, i see nothing to be sorry for! you and husband set rules for her as parents and now he's going back on them because she's upset about the consequences? i say he owes you an apology", "Report the photos as porn to fb. NTA at all", "NTA, Does your MIL not read the news? Is she really unaware of where these pictures will likely end up?", "NTA - Naked baby pics can be classed a child p@$nography and that's a big no no.", "Ignore your husband, it\u2019s gross he can\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong here. That\u2019s HIS problem. You\u2019re not the one with a problem.", "Whoops, my bad. That was a typo. I guess I just don't get the amount of male SO's who seem afraid to stand up to their mothers. That's never been an issue for me. But my mom is pretty chill", "You are NTA but your husband is as bad as his mother. This is how children become the prey of pedophiles. Ask your husband what he will do when your son comes home saying someone from grandma\u2019s neighborhood/church group/community center/whatever asked him to pose like in the photos. This is DEEPLY disturbing that your husband seems to not at all be worried about your son becoming the target of creeps and thinks his mom\u2019s feelings are more important. \n\nAnd for folks awareness, if you go through the accounts of those mommy blogs where they post hundreds of pics of their kids, a massive chunk of the followers are either older people with no kids, or \u201cshadow\u201d accounts. Those accounts often have hundreds of pedophiles following them. Those moms have built a following off of exposing their kids to pedophiles\u2026", "NTA.\n\nGranted, she\u2019s 53yo, so I get that she may have thought there was nothing wrong with the photos/video (there are nude/diapered baby photos in my family\u2019s photo albums, for instance, usually in a \u201chere\u2019s the baby after being born at the hospital\u201d kind of sense), but you had told her not to do that, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re coming out of nowhere with this.\n\nThe thing that is even more egregious, in my opinion, is that she took photos of your child without your knowledge or consent.  It\u2019s not just the photos and videos you sent her.  There\u2019s stuff you did not know about or approve on there too.  And, as I said, she may not realize that the internet is not the same as a physical photo album.  Anyone can see her posts (assuming she didn\u2019t set it to private or something).  And that includes online predators.\n\nCould things have been handled in a more civil way?  Probably.  But you have every right to feel angry.  You set a boundary and it was ignored.", "NTA! Contact Facebook to have them removed.", "NTA, she knew she wasn't supposed to do it and did it anyways. You should show your husband the content of the messages in case she decided to get a little dramatic about the encounter.", "NTA internet safety for children is no joke and your husband needs a reminder of that", "NTA!!!! \n\nI have a 1 year old and we don't share pictures of him on Facebook, full stop. But even if we did, the rule I've always heard is that if you wouldn't want a similar picture of yourself shared on online, don't post it! How hard is that to follow? \n\nAsk your husband if he would be just fine of pictures of him naked in the tub floating around the internet, because there is no difference imo.", "You aren\u2019t the ah but your husband and his mom sure are.", "We hope so, honestly, with fb having the ability to block posts from specific people, who knows.", "NTA report it to FB and demand she takes it down.", "May I suggest you investigate the existence of a thing called-the paragraph.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas for your MIL NTA under what conditions does she think this is correct \"I had them up for a year\" should tell her how little you pay attention to her rantings. \n\nNext time just complain to facebook directly about her unauthorized pictures and have them penalize her.", "NTA - This is the point I see if I can hack into her account and delete her entire account.  You are so in the right here that it boggles my mind anyone could think otherwise.  Your husband needs to wake up and understand how massive a problem this is.  I would also look into what you can do on Facebook to report this as a violation since they don't have permission to post your photos and those of your minor child.", "Wow NTA - no one is allowed to post any pics at all of my daughter online, even clothed. You laid down the rules and your MIL violated them in spectacular fashion", "NTA- you need to point out to your husband that social media is one of the big ways child predators find material to aid them in their malevolence. Your MIL was WAY out of line in what she did. You have no idea what kind of people she\u2019s interacting with and if her settings are public, ANYONE can see what she posted. You do NOT need to apologize to her, and your husband needs to pull his head out of his behind. This wasn\u2019t a photo in an album on a shelf that was passed around at a gathering. This was video and photos of your baby, without clothes that are now on the internet forever. You are definitely NTA, but your husband and MIL sure are.", "NTA I personally would no longer allow MIL unsupervised time with my kid. If her poor judgment led her to post naked photos of your child online, what would she think was ok next? \n\nI\u2019m not sure how much a lawyer can accomplish, but I would consider speaking with one. Deleting the photos from Facebook is not enough; she shouldn\u2019t have taken them in the first place, but I suspect you\u2019ll have a hard time getting her to delete them altogether without strong-arming her.", "Nta", "I just did exactly the same thing."]}
