I live in NYC and my dad completely cut me off emotionally and financially when I was 15. Have heard from him 2x in the last 10-15 years though I stopped caring to keep track of it.\n\nAfter my dad remarried and had his second set of children he did not give a rats ass about me or my brother. I grew up in projects and raised my younger brother who is autistic. He is great and I'm very proud of him.\n\nMy stepmother evidently passed away last year which I heard through the grapevine. Out of thin air my biological father is now literally harassing me every 2 weeks to meet my alleged half-sister. She has a trust fund and does not work and likely never will (again from what I have been told). She is approx. 17/18 years old I'm not even sure honestly. Who knows maybe one day she will work but I can't imagine we have anything in common.\n\nAITA for not wanting to meet this kid? Like I don't see how there would be anything to discuss. I have no idea why my bio father is so desperate for me to meet her... but he shipped her to NY. She is staying a hotel and I reluctantly agreed to meet her Friday. I kind of want to cancel. I just really do not see how meeting her would be positive in any way for her or me? She is also technically an adult. If she wanted to meet she could reach out to me directly, no?\n\nNot sure what the motive is here but is definitely sus.

Also she is 18 and we all know that how intelligent 18 year old are.", "NTA; who does this man think he is he abandoned you and left you to take care of your sibling. And when he has a problem out of the blue starts harassing you. He feels entitled to your time and super out of line if you ask me. You have to set boundaries with him or he will think he can waltz back in and play like nothing happened. I say listen to ur gut dude. If you don\u2019t wanna meet her don\u2019t do it.", "I'm going to go upfront with NAH, I can't tell you that how you feel is invalid - it's your feelings after all.\n\nThe kid's no asshole either, she's lost her mom and has just been parcelled off to NY by her one remaining parent, so she's probably not exactly feeling super cheery either.\n\nYou've nothing to lose by meeting her - at worst, the two of you mutually agree that you've got nothing in common but a sperm donor.\n\nAt best, you effectively 'gain' a kid sister and get to extend the small circle of people you call family.\n\nIt's worth the effort. Doesn't sound as though it would hurt her to have a good role model, either.", "Based on the information given, I\u2019m going to say NTA. \n\nI wonder if your father is hoping to \u201cunencumber\u201d himself of your stepsister.", "NTA, ask for the return flight info before you meet her (airline and reservation code.  She might be thinking that she is moving in with you.   If he cannot or will not give this to you do not meet.  Be prepared to buy her a ticket home.", "NTA for feeling like this.\n\nBUT\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if you have more in common with her than you think. Do you really think your shit dad will suddenly have become father of the year for his younger kids? Him trying to push your sister onto you feels like he's trying to abdicate emotional responsibility for her. She benefited from him financially but did she get emotional support from him?", "NTA - You have a bad relationship with your \"dad\" for sure.  I don't think it would hurt to meet with your sister once. If she seems fine you can decide if you want to continue to develop a relationship with her.

And your half-sister isn't anything to you beyond a name and some genes in common. How you handle this is entirely up to you.\n\nNTA", "\"Like I don't see how this is my problem.\" You said that twice but I don't see that anyone said it's a problem.  \n\n\nI mean...you're NTA because there's no reason to get together but on the same token, there's no reason to hate on her. She could reach out to you directly but seeing as you've never met, it's better to through a stranger. She's a technical adult. Not an adulty adult. She was very recently seen as a child and some people I'm sure still see her that way.\n\nNothing really bad can come from you meeting. I'm not sure what you're so paranoid about.", "NTA it seems weird, like there would be an anterior motive.

You have zero obligation to play along. NTA.", "Hi OP,\n\nI can understand your disinterest in meeting your half-sister. Maybe bio-dad is trying to find a surrogate mother for her. maybe he's trying to use this as a chance to reconnect with you too. \n\nI think this girl is innocent in everything and we always have room for more love in our hearts. And like you said, you also don't know how meeting her could be beneficial to you now or in the future. \n\nI think if you arrange for a structured way to meet her there's nothing to lose. Like meet for dinner. \n\nIf you find you want to have her in your life you don't need to welcome dad in too. You also have no obligation to this child, she has resources to care for her so no pressure on your end. \n\nUltimately do what your gut says. I'd be compassionate though, this young girl just lost her mom right as she's entering adulthood. You can be a nice memory for her even if you only meet once.\n\nBest of luck with whatever you decide!", "NTA , your life , your choice , you don\u2019t have to meet her.\n\nYour dad probs just wants to pawn her off on you , and go have his third round of children", "NTA and there must be a reason for him pushing her off on you, and I guarantee it won't benefit you at all. \n\nI would definitely cancel.  \n\nYou're in a good position and don\u2019t need to feel any obligation at all. \n\nYou've done great and are wonderful for caring for your brother, if you were my kid, I'd tell you that I'm proud of you.", "NTA. You are welcome to your strong emotions around your father\u2019s motives and abandonment, but please remember that your half-sister is likely feeling like you did 20 years ago with a father who is abandoning her (in this case because his babysitter/wife is not longer around to shoulder the burden of being a parent). It\u2019s not her fault any more than it was yours. You do not need to take on a parental role, but being kind to her and giving her a chance to potentially start a connection seems like the right thing to do, and a pretty low bar as long as you can come to terms with her not being responsible for your dad\u2019s choices in her life thus far.", "NTA\n\nWe have two families: the one we are born into (blood/bio/adopted), and the one we actually choose.\n\nHalf& sister might be blood family, doesn't mean she's chosen family. And that is only up to you.", "NTA. why didn\u2019t she wanna meet you before? Now that her mom passed she finally wants to meet you? Seems a bit suspicious and i\u2019m wondering why she didn\u2019t want a relationship before. But overall you aren\u2019t required to meet someone who is essentially a stranger when it would most likely just cause a negative impact in your life, because it\u2019s not just your sister, this meeting could bring on a lot of traumatic memories and there\u2019s a good possibility of seeing your father there too. Do what is best for you.", "you're nta. id be curious what's up with her. you don't have to be her \"sister\" or even develop a relationship, but your AH of a father ends with him. \n\ni'm confused about why tbh. maybe they wanna harvest some organs off ya? \ud83d\ude02 \n\nregardless of what you choose you are not responsible for anything other than  being civil with this girl. tell the dad to F off", "Info: what's the relevance of her having a trust fund being mentioned? Is that just to show you may not have things in common because you worked and she won't have to?", "Soft YTA. This kid didn't create the bad situation. She also cannot contact you directly unless she's been given your contact information. As clever as she might be (or not) she's no mind reader. She also just lost her mom. You're expecting more of her than she's likely of doing; a trust fund upbringing isn't exactly known for building character or initiative. That assumes she really is a trust fund baby, and she may not be. All you know about her is what you've been told. By your father. Who isn't exactly a reliable source.\n\nYou may as well meet her; she may be a useful ally and possibly a decent human being. You and she do have one thing in common: a sucky parent who isn't likely to reliably stay out of your hair.", "Soft YTA. You are a damn adult. Act like one.", "YMBTAH if you do not make the effort to meet her.  It is not her fault that your father has been less than he should be to you.  She must be there because *she* wants to meet you.  Surely this is not a comfortable situation for her either.  You've both been robbed of knowing each other through the years.  I'd say meet up and go from there, whatever you are comfortable with.  Find out what she is really like and make your future decisions accordingly.  Hope you circle back to let us know how it went.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That way if something Shady happens you can just peace out. Whereas if she comes here then if anything happens she might be dependent on you.", "NTA \n\nBut be careful, your dad might try to unload parenting of this kid on you.", "Dad is definitely T A. You're definitely NTA and 1/2 sister has yet to be determined. You don't know this young lady so whether you meet up with her or not you're in the clear.", "It\u2019s your decission and if you are not ready you should not meet her. Your biodad has clear intentions namely shift the burden of care towards you. On the other hand maybe in a couple of gears you should meet just for the reason that you are sisters and she cannot be blamed for her dad\u2019s behaviour", "NTA. Sometimes people feel bad when they get older and lose some people they love and face their own mortality. So they try to \u201creach out\u201d to folks they cut off before. I suspect this is a situation where it is about your dad not his kids.\n\nMy advice is just give it a try and have 0 expectations. She\u2019s your half sister and maybe it\u2019ll be a positive thing.\n\nEither way, you certainly owe nothing to either of them.", "NTA, entirely. You are under no obligation to meet this girl, it is a weird and shady situation, and because you have no relationship I guarantee this girl is not really gonna mind all that much if you cancel. Is NYC scary for a young Kansas teen? Eh, depends on the teen. But if she was already flying out and has a place to stay, chances are good that she's coming out of her own free will and your sperm donor just saw you as an opportunity through which he could get a check in that she was safe and doing fine. Knowing that you took good care of your brother, he's probably hoping to get some similar emotional oversight and labor from you for half sister.\n\nSo while crazy stuff could be afoot, it's much more likely he's just 1) totally not self-aware about what a garbage move this is and 2) only really thinking about her.\n\nSo, consider this entirely from your POV. Is there a chance for closure here? Maybe. But probably not. Still, it may be a chance you want to take while it's available to you. But certainly don't feel bad about not wasting valuable time on this if you'd rather not.\n\nYou've done a really awesome job without him.", "at eighteen, an especially in children who were sheltered and from rich parents, they don\u2019t even realize they are actually 18 and can make decisions for them selves. sister might not even want to meet OP", "I wonder if OP's dad/sperm donor is trying to pawn off the half-sister on OP, clearing his hands of all the parental duties to follow given stepmother is no more,  just like he left OP and her brother to raise after themselves alone.", "Love this answer! I think you really summarized how I am feeling. It seems that he just wants to take advantage of a situation. I think the only thing I would gain from meeting the kid is closure on all ends.", "I have to disagree on this part:\n\n>You've nothing to lose by meeting her - at worst, the two of you mutually agree that you've got nothing in common but a sperm donor.\n\nThis is nowhere near the worst possible outcome.\n\nOne worse possibility is that OP might find that she has nothing in common and wants to go separate ways but half-sister refuses to accept that and disenage. OP could quickly find herself stuck in an involuntary case of New Best Friend Syndrome.\n\nOr, as another commenter has pointed out, OP might find that half-sister was shipped to NYC with no solid plans for the returm trip home. Potentially with an intention that she'd stay with OP for an extended period of time.\n\nThe combination of dad's harrassment to meet the half-sister and the pre-emptive sending of the half-sister to NYC makes that latter a distinct possibility.\n\nOthers have made \"spare a kidney\" type comments. Dad's behavior here makes me as inclined to wonder if he's dying and expects OP to move into a full on *in loco parentis* role.\n\nLots of ways this could turn into a massive problem in OPs life.\n\nOP is NTA. Half-sister we know pretty much nothing about as a person. But dad? He sure sounds like a total kneebiter.", "Or if someone needs to have a kidney.", "Whoa this is a very solid point !!
