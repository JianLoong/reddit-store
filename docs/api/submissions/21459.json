I live in NYC and my dad completely cut me off emotionally and financially when I was 15. Have heard from him 2x in the last 10-15 years though I stopped caring to keep track of it.\n\nAfter my dad remarried and had his second set of children he did not give a rats ass about me or my brother. I grew up in projects and raised my younger brother who is autistic. He is great and I'm very proud of him.\n\nMy stepmother evidently passed away last year which I heard through the grapevine. Out of thin air my biological father is now literally harassing me every 2 weeks to meet my alleged half-sister. She has a trust fund and does not work and likely never will (again from what I have been told). She is approx. 17/18 years old I'm not even sure honestly. Who knows maybe one day she will work but I can't imagine we have anything in common.\n\nAITA for not wanting to meet this kid? Like I don't see how there would be anything to discuss. I have no idea why my bio father is so desperate for me to meet her... but he shipped her to NY. She is staying a hotel and I reluctantly agreed to meet her Friday. I kind of want to cancel. I just really do not see how meeting her would be positive in any way for her or me? She is also technically an adult.

It\u2019s not her fault any more than it was yours. You do not need to take on a parental role, but being kind to her and giving her a chance to potentially start a connection seems like the right thing to do, and a pretty low bar as long as you can come to terms with her not being responsible for your dad\u2019s choices in her life thus far.", "NTA\n\nWe have two families: the one we are born into (blood/bio/adopted), and the one we actually choose.\n\nHalf& sister might be blood family, doesn't mean she's chosen family.

She also cannot contact you directly unless she's been given your contact information. As clever as she might be (or not) she's no mind reader. She also just lost her mom. You're expecting more of her than she's likely of doing; a trust fund upbringing isn't exactly known for building character or initiative. That assumes she really is a trust fund baby, and she may not be. All you know about her is what you've been told. By your father. Who isn't exactly a reliable source.\n\nYou may as well meet her; she may be a useful ally and possibly a decent human being.

Surely this is not a comfortable situation for her either.  You've both been robbed of knowing each other through the years.  I'd say meet up and go from there, whatever you are comfortable with.

You are under no obligation to meet this girl, it is a weird and shady situation, and because you have no relationship I guarantee this girl is not really gonna mind all that much if you cancel. Is NYC scary for a young Kansas teen? Eh, depends on the teen. But if she was already flying out and has a place to stay, chances are good that she's coming out of her own free will and your sperm donor just saw you as an opportunity through which he could get a check in that she was safe and doing fine. Knowing that you took good care of your brother, he's probably hoping to get some similar emotional oversight and labor from you for half sister.\n\nSo while crazy stuff could be afoot, it's much more likely he's just 1) totally not self-aware about what a garbage move this is and 2) only really thinking about her.\n\nSo, consider this entirely from your POV. Is there a chance for closure here? Maybe. But probably not. Still, it may be a chance you want to take while it's available to you.

OP could quickly find herself stuck in an involuntary case of New Best Friend Syndrome.\n\nOr, as another commenter has pointed out, OP might find that half-sister was shipped to NYC with no solid plans for the returm trip home. Potentially with an intention that she'd stay with OP for an extended period of time.\n\nThe combination of dad's harrassment to meet the half-sister and the pre-emptive sending of the half-sister to NYC makes that latter a distinct possibility.\n\nOthers have made \"spare a kidney\" type comments. Dad's behavior here makes me as inclined to wonder if he's dying and expects OP to move into a full on *in loco parentis* role.\n\nLots of ways this could turn into a massive problem in OPs life.\n\nOP is NTA.

Make sure the reality of your dad casting you off to be her dad is evident. \n\nWho knows if she\u2019s here to plead on his behalf, ask for something, or is getting dumped by dad too- but if she\u2019s going to go fishing around in this pond, make sure she leaves knowing the reality of what happened.", "NTA", "Do you need to meet all your dads orgasms or just this one.", "NTA if you would cancel. Your feelings are valid.\n\nI would though if I were you not judge your sister for who her father is. She might be a really nice and humble person and nothing like your dad. She might have had a difficult time growing up due to her parents being assholes. Who knows?   \n\n\nMeeting her might add value to both of your lives. Maybe she has used your dad as a middleman in getting this meeting planned because she is too shy to contact you herself? Anyway soon she will be an adult and having a relationship with her does not mean you have to have a relationship with him. \n\nIf I were you I'd be curious about her and would go to the meeting.

I'm guessing stepmom did most of the heavy lifting parenting wise, and now that she's gone logically he's going to reach out to the person that already raised two of his children for him. Definitely using you what a butthole.\n\nThat being said if she's already on her way, it would be kind of rude to back out now, but wholeheartedly agree you have zero obligation to her. \n\nAlso idk if anyone else has said this but is there a chance your stepsister might also be on the spectrum and your dad is overwhelmed and doesn't know how to handle her ? Idk maybe I'm reading too much between the lines but the whole thing with a living stipend, suddenly now coming out of the woodworks now that her mom has passed and you already raising your brother (which by the way, HELL yeah you are amazing for doing that, I understand a bit of what that situation is like from my own family and it's not easy,  your a real one ). My mind just went there, that is just speculation, but maybe be prepared for that possibility.\n\nGood luck and please come back and update us!!!", "You\u2019re NTA, your dad is definitely TA - but your half sister is NTA either.\n\nOkay, she\u2019s lived with money and still has money. Fine. But from what you know of your father it\u2019s pretty unlikely she\u2019s had emotional care either. She\u2019s a kid who has just lost her mom and has been shipped off somewhere by her dad. Yes, you got through it, but can you at least pause to acknowledge that *it sucked* and someone who was even remotely kin being halfway kind to you would have really, really helped?\n\nIt isn\u2019t fair that nobody did that for you. It\u2019s understandable that your feelings are ruling the roost here. But as you\u2019ve pointed out, you are the adult in this equation. Right now, you are gearing up to blame this kid for your father\u2019s unfairness and for, in your imagination, getting the childhood you didn\u2019t. Stop and consider that money is great, it\u2019s better to be crying in a mansion than a shelter if those are the options, but it doesn\u2019t mean a happy childhood or a good parent we\u2019re things she experienced either. She is *another victim of your dad*, not an aggressor. Her existence didn\u2019t push you out of the life you could have had, your father being dreadful did. He\u2019s gearing up to abandon her the same way he abandoned you.\n\nIf you really can\u2019t set the trauma aside enough to even be kind or go in with an open mind then okay; trauma is trauma; you\u2019re NTA for not getting over it at the drop of a hat. If you can\u2019t go in with the intent to treat the child decently then it\u2019s okay to cancel and say you can\u2019t do this. In that eventuality you should cut off comms with your dad and tell him and her why, because it\u2019s only fair to her to make it clear this is an issue with him, nothing else.\n\nIf you can manage it, though, this is an example of \u201cit ran in the family until it ran into me\u201d. You have the option to break the cycle of abandonment and potentially add another supportive family relationship in spite of your father. Yeah, it\u2019ll take some processing on your part. It\u2019s up to you if you want to take that emotional risk.\n\nJust whatever you do, don\u2019t treat the kid like she\u2019s TA. She\u2019s just a grieving kid. Ease up.", "NTA. Be careful because he\u2019s definitely trying to dump this kid on you and make her \u201cyour\u201d responsibility. Her mother is gone and your father doesn\u2019t want her.

I think part of being an adult is realizing that you can make your own decisions regarding who you let into your life.", "I agree. I think the half sister might be lonely. Her mom died and if the dad is as detached and uncaring as he was the first time around, maybe she\u2019s looking for a sense of family. OP said he had another \u201cset\u201d of kids, but then only mentioned the one. I wonder if the half siblings has other siblings?", "I would at least explore the possibility that really she wants to meet you and is going through him.

All that you know is that your bio-dad wants you to meet her. Even if she is a wonderful person to hang around with I'd suggest there's too much baggage. \n\nThe mention of trust fund sounds sus. Why would your bio-dad mention the trust fund unless he's indicating that you can take her in without having to worry about costs? \n\nThere seem to be too many red flags. Consider cancelling the meet up. \n\nI've heard it been said that one must choose very carefully whom to admit into one's life.

And getting to leave Kansas to go to NYC might be part of her desire as well. It would be nice if you met her, but if you are truly uncomfortable you don\u2019t have to.

I would meet but it is me, I always want to know more people and take risks for this. This doesn't make me or you AH. Also, if your life is very good, you are very satisfied, then you would have less motivation to meet new people. In my opinion, if everything is routine, meeting new people would be very good because I get bored of routine. Doing is better than doing nothing.\n But, if you do not want to meet this girl due to your father, then you are wrong. She is not responsible for your father's sins and rejecting her because of this would be wrong.", "You should be calling CPS for child abandonment.", "Sounds like your bio Dad wants you to step in to be this kids new parent figure now her Mum has passed away.

So, there could now be two things in common."]}
