Gentle YTA.", "YTA.", "Yta", "Have you ever met a child? Of course they were going to pick the pizza. Your sister put effort into making them a homemade meal, and maybe she did so with the specific purpose of giving them something a little healthier before several days filled with rich Christmas foods and treats, or because she knew that after traveling they might be exhausted and could use something with a little more nutritional value to ground them. \n\nShe\u2019s right that if you wanted to give them the \u201cvariety\u201d of pizza because several dishes that didn\u2019t come from Dominos is more diverse, you could have suggested it to her.

Let\u2019s ditch the cooking and split the cost of getting some pizza delivered.\u201d \n\nYou also quite obviously did it behind her back since you didn\u2019t mention it and did so after she went to run ANOTHER errand.

Is the food she cooked going to waste?  How old are the kids\n\nI can see this going a lot of different ways.  Kids are almost always going to go for pizza over chicken and rice.

Of course my kids are also just kids, so when someone waltzes in with happy meals which they almost never get, they will not look at a well cooked steak or cauliflower, so she always thought she was right.
