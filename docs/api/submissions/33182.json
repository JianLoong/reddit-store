However, I think you could have worded what you were actually trying to say a whole lot better.", "Sounds like you're both assholes tbh. Her because first off she shouldn't flip out because a gift was going to be late because you shouldn't be obligated to buy anyone anything if you don't want to. Yta for taking any frustrations out on the little girl because even if you don't consider her family I'm sure that little girl considers you part of hers and if she ever heard you say something like that, it could stick with that child her whole life and not feel loved by anyone that isn't blood family. Be smarter kid and take your anger out on the right people", "ESH- there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with giving her a gift a little later, and of course you aren\u2019t obligated to give a gift at all. Your stepmother seriously overreacted. However, you just threw gas onto the flames by saying what you said. You should\u2019ve let your stepmother cool off. Pick your battles.", "NTA\n\nStep was 17 and you were 9 when your parents got together- not moved in, got together. Even if she was a bio you wouldn\u2019t have any type of relationship. She\u2019s not your sibling in any meaningful sense of the word with or without blood.", "NTA. You have little money. Buy socks for everyone and save the rest of money for yourself.", "NTA\n\nYour stepmother was nasty.  You're right, Adel isn't really family considering you barely interact with her.   You don't get on with your stepmother's daughter either, so how is this family?\n\nYour stepmother sounds abusive, how did she treat you while growing up?", "ESH.\n\nYour stepmom was being melodramatic about the gift arriving late (though c\u2019mon, you\u2019re old enough to be at least trying to get gifts ordered in time - obviously, shit happens sometimes, but getting things to arrive on time is part of the gift-giving process.  Waiting until less than 10 days before Christmas isn\u2019t good).\n\nBut why on earth did you say that your step niece isn\u2019t your family when you consider her family?  Why say the hurtful opposite of the way you actually feel?  That excuse is going nuclear.  You should have just acknowledged your mistake and promised to do better with timing next year, or acknowledged you waited too long to have something shipped and go shop in person so the gift won\u2019t be late.", "NTA stepmom sounds unhinged. You have no obligation to get anyone a gift. A gift shouldn\u2019t be expected but the thought appreciated afterwards. It\u2019s thoughtful of you to have wanted to get her a gift in the first place and atrocious stepmom yelled and lost her cool that the gift wouldn\u2019t be here on time. What the actual F?!\n\nIn my family we have several days of celebration. It\u2019s totally cool if something doesn\u2019t arrive \u201con time\u201d because life is full of uncontrollable events. I\u2019m so sick of people saying gifts should be an expectation and she raised you making your stepsisters kid family. Nope! Family is who you choose from now on. At 19 you\u2019re old enough to start thinking about who is healthy to have in your life. Who brings joy and positivity to it. Not unnecessary obligations and being made to feel guilty. You\u2019re absolutely allowed to have your own thoughts and opinions about family; what that means to you moving forward", "Yta.  How would you feel if your step mom said that about you?\n\nFamily is more than blood.  You should know that more than anyone.", "You're not wrong in your comment. No one is _ever_ obliged to give a gift. We do so either out of love, or societal pressure. \n\nI can understand you snapping at her out of frustration as she was being incredibly pushy and very insensitive. \n\nHere's what I would do if I were you (and this is just what I would do, it's not what you have to do):\n\nA) explain to your father (and possibly your SM if she's willing to listen) that you didn't mean to say you don't consider Adel family. You do. It was simply that your SM was making you stressed about something you were already upset about, and so you lashed out and pointed out how the two of you are only related by marriage and not blood, which is how most people claim their family. Tell them you love Adel and you're very sad the present you wanted to give her won't arrive by Christmas. \n\n_Don't apologise for what you said, but how you said it._ This is important, because you weren't wrong, and your SM was equally wrong for pressuring you and what she said to you. \n\n2) Call or text Adel's mom and ask if she'd be ok with you giving Adel her present a little after Christmas. She might not mind at all! Explain how the vendor messed up your original gift and now you won't be able to get it for her until after Christmas. \n\nC) [This only applies if you're all doing Christmas together] Find some small little toy or cheap silly thing that you can wrap for Adel to have on Christmas day so she doesn't feel like you forgot her. It doesn't have to be anything exciting, she's only 3 after all. It can be some chocolates or candy, or a stuffed toy, or some big sheets of paper and markers/pens/crayons (whatever), anything like that. \n\nGood luck with whatever you decide to do.\n\n(ETA: I typed this whole thing out thinking Adel was actually your step-of niece's name, and was thinking the whole time, \"wow, mom must really be a fan!\" LOL)", "NTA - when couples try to blend their families they don\u2019t like to hear this kind of thing because they want everyone to be \u201cone big happy family\u201d but this isn\u2019t the reality for a lot of people and they feel little or no attachment to the relatives of their parents new spouses.", "ESH, but YTA mainly because you went somewhere you shouldn't with what you said. Being blood related isn't the qualifier for family.", "NTA\n\nThere's absolutely no reason for stepmom to overreact like this (over just a Christmas gift, come on), then escalate this into an argument after OP tried to make peace.  \n\nI'll also point out OP never said \"Adel wasn't part of my family\" to Adel.  OP gave stepmom a fight, and it sounds like stepmom picks them pretty often.", "NTA - I think a lot of the y.t.a's are misinterpreting what you meant when you said she wasn't family. You meant she wasn't bloodrelated family, you do see her as part of the general family you're a part of as well. The thing is, that doesn't even really matter. \n\nYou tried to do something nice and for reasons beyond your control, it couldn't happen. Then your stepmom got angry and impatient because you had to look for an alternative. She acted as if nothing you did was going to be good enough, than gets mad just ebcause a gift could potentially get there late. Why doesn't she take you shopping? That way you can find a gift the same day you go, and it's in time for Christmas. \n\nYour Stepmom's attitude is the problem here, you said nothing wrong. She blew up and responded really disproportionate to the situation, which is incredibly unfair for you. I advice you to start creating some (emotional) distance from her, and start setting (and sticking to) boundaries. This means that if you feel uncomfortable with doing something, you don't do it. You don't do things for her you don't have the energy or capacity for. It means if you say no, then that means no. If she tries to guilttrip or convince you, you cut the conversation and say something like \"I already responded, I'm not changing my answer, now please drop it\". She goes on, you walk away. These are difficult to do, but it is going to help you gain perspective on how you are actually being treated, it'll help you gain confidence, it will teach you to stand up for yourself in a respectful and healthy manner and teach you to take care of your needs.", "Yta, your stepmother took the role up and became your mother from what I see here. Assuming so, it\u2019s an assumption that you see your stepsister as family when you\u2019re buying her gift, why wouldn\u2019t the family term roll down to her daughter as well? You mentioned money so I\u2019m assuming its a financial reason that you\u2019re kind of half assing on whether or not to buy your sister\u2019s daughter a gift. If so, they it could\u2019ve been worded better rather than attempting to save face about finances concerning christmas.", "NTA but your stepmother is for the way she spoke to you", "YTA what a terrible thing to say about a little girl that unfortunately thinks of you as family.", "Well, NTA here as you sincerely wanted to find a nice gift, the stepmom pushed you and you said something that is kinda true.", "YTA - Your step sister was also being an asshole, you escalated the situation by diminishing your relationship with someone who you still have to see. Telling someone you're not my family is usually done before running away and going no contact.  You pissed in the corn flakes.", "YTA. \n\nby your logic your stepmom should\u2019ve never anything for you.  Yeah she was abrupt with you and kinda annoying about the gift but it\u2019s her granddaughter so that\u2019s probably why. But for you to jump to the extreme of saying she isn\u2019t your family is actually gross", "[deleted]", "Yta, as a stepmother very much raising my stepdaughters, bc their mother won\u2019t, I\u2019d be disappointed in them not accepting me and my family as their own. I have taken a huge responsibility to physically, emotionally, and financially support them and take on the role of mom. I think all of this will sink in more once you have kids yourself and you see all the hardwork it takes to raise a child, let alone one that doesn\u2019t belong to you and you have no obligation to. Out of respect for the step mom buy the kid a present. Think of it as a gift to the stepmom who stepped up when she didn\u2019t have to.", "YTA, most definitely. I hope you grow up sooner rather than later.", "YTA. That was a mean thing to say. You were immature and nasty, and you hurt her feelings. She raised you, and it comes across as you have no gratitude.", "YTA.\n\nI panicked today because I forgot to buy a gift for my brother-in-law's son for Christmas. He and my sister just got married in October. I've only met the kid a couple of times. Regardless, he is my nephew and he is deserving of a present from me as his aunt.", "ESH. Your stepsister's daughter is definitely part of your family even if your relationships are kind of strained, and it was rude to just say outright that she wasn't. Family is more than just genetics--genetically speaking you aren't family, but you definitely have familial connections. You even said yourself that you consider Adel part of your family, so splitting hairs on not being genetically related made you sound horrible to your family. Technically, no one has an obligation to give anyone anything on Christmas, but if someone were to say that they would sound like a jerk.\n\nHowever, your stepmom massively overreacted to the original problem. Sometimes gifts don't work out and come a little late (I don't think I've ever had a Christmas where I gave every gift on time).", "YTA.", "YTA - she may not be blood related but if your stepmom raised you and considered YOU family, the little girl is your niece.", "Esh. She shouldn\u2019t have been so upsetti spaghetti about a late present and you shouldn\u2019t have said something so cruel. Imagine if adel had heard you? 3 is old enough to have some semblance of an understanding. \n\nYour step mother and you seem to have some issues that neither of you are talking about. For now you need to focus on not fueling the fire.", "YTA - you are ungrateful and rude. She raised you and this is your family. Christmas never changes each year - same date. It\u2019s really not that difficult to make sure presents are bought in time for Christmas.", "Your dad's wife did bad in rushing you to buy the present, yes, on the other side, you basically said to her \"you are only an acquaintance that happens to be married to my dad, and I'm not responsible for making you waste your time, patience, or money, since I didn't ask you to step-up\", which, fair, you didn't. \n\n\nBut anyone with a little bit of gratitude, love, or care for a person, even when angry, upset or frustrated with said person, knows that technicalities don't apply on those bonds. \n\n\nSo what happened is that you cut those bonds, by admitting to not seeing them as family, so yeah, don't bother to give them anything, besides the kid who can't understand the situation, nobody on that family would want anything from you.\n\n\nI can't say you are the TA, because you can't be forced to see them as a family bond since they aren't blood related, but your dad's wife's feelings are justified after your statement. \n\n\nSadly NAH, but I will reconsider my idea of maybe adopting a grown child in the future, since I wouldn't like to be on your dad's wife shoes.", "ESH. Your stepmother overreacted, but if you have a good relationship with your stepmother and sister, that baby is part of your family and to say she isn\u2019t is insulting to your stepmom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
