When we got married she was starting college and live in dorms ever since during school time and in summer breaks she lived with us at home (kind of but she did travel alot with her friends and also stayed some time with her mother so she stayed with us a month maximum). Later on when she was 21 she decided to live on her own even in summer breaks. My husband and I also decided to buy a new house for ourselves , it is a very small cozy house consisting of 1 bedroom which is the master bedroom. I am a professor but I mainly work from home as I give online classes not in university. My schedule goes from from 8:am to 6:pm with breaks in between. First I used to do it in house but it was just distracting for me and my husband as well so I rented studio but that wasn\u2019t ideal either as it was expensive rent and studios had almost 0 resources for me to use in breaks. So I decided to reform the house by installing an external studio that will be attached to the house (like garages basically) and my husband agreed. Mind you I paid for the whole process alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my step-daughter had to quit her job (fired) and can\u2019t pay rent now for her home or even dorms so my husband told her she could come. I talked with my husband reminding him that we have only on bedroom occupied by us. He said that his daughter can sleep in my studio if we get her a bed I told him my studio is basically my office I work there for long hours and she is a college student that\u2019s not gonna work she needs to focus and so do I plus adding a bed can\u2019t be an option because my office desk takes most of the space if I got rid of the desk I can\u2019t work.He told me that this is an emergency and I can rent a studio for myself again\u2026..now I paid my to install a permanent studio in the house just so I wouldn\u2019t pay rent for other studios. I already paid for a studio. Why should I leave the studio I paid for to rent other studios and if renting and being in other studios was practical for me I wouldn\u2019t have gone through the headache of reformation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I told him instead of asking me to leave my property and go pay rent he and her mother can kindly rent her a place until she finds a job. She can\u2019t be with her mother as she is in a different state from collage. His reasoning of not wanting to pay her rent is that he sees this as an opportunity for him to have father-daughter bonding and he wants her close.His counterclaim was that I earn more. While I do infact earn more than him I don\u2019t see this as a justification to have me pay rent for studios when I own one already just so he and her mother can save their money and not like they are poor. Idk about my husband\u2019s ex but my husband isn\u2019t poor. Now he promised his daughter a place in our home but I am not backing down .", "created_utc": 1697439235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178zw99/aita_for_not_turning_my_office_a_bedroom_for_my/", "score": 2747, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he wants more time for bonding or what not - it's on him to pay up. Plus, she is a grown up and needs to find a job. And he can't ask you to compromise your income, let them take over the room you payed for and pay for renting a new place, on top of it, just coz he wants father-daughter time.", "NTA\n\nThis is the solution ***\"I told him instead of asking me to leave my property and go pay rent he and her mother can kindly rent her a place until she finds a job.\"***\n\nYour husband promised his daughter your office you paid for. This won't fly, this is your office, and he's responsible for his daughter, you're not.", "NTA. You've gone to a lot of effort and expense to arrange a studio in which you can work. Step daughter can sleep on the couch or as you suggested, parents can help rent her a place. Husband can help her with apartment hunting and relocating as a bonding experience, no need to impact on your ability to earn an income.", "NTA- get a lock for your office or he will move her in when you\u2019re not around.", "NTA you need that room as an office. It's not like anywhere else in the house can be turned into an office. Maybe she can crash on the couch till she finds a place. If her dad wanted to have a guest bedroom he should have spoke up and looked for one more room.", "NTA. That you earn more should be a point against letting your stepdaughter into your office, not for it. If she gets in it\u2019s going to be hard to set and keep boundaries, and less likely she\u2019ll leave because she is less motivated to do so since she\u2019s not working at the moment (and you husband has motive to keep her around). A short term guest shouldn\u2019t have issue with an air mattress in the lounge room unless they have back problems.\n\nI second getting a lock for your office.", "NTA\n\nBuy a fold-out couch for the living room or something. Or if its big enough, let her sleep on the current couch.\n\nI don't want to jump to conclusions, but if the daughter gets the room, she might be there for a LONG time. Not just because of her, but also because of her father wanting that bond", "NTA. \"Do you want me to KEEP earning more? Then I need to work. That means I need my studio; which I paid for and had installed. You can either find funds to rent your daughter her own place, or you and your ex can figure out something. But I need to work, I built this space, I'm not going to screw myself over just because you want to be SuperDad too late in her life. No. You move her into my office and you're going to get divorce papers.\"\n\nBecause this would be a hill I die on.", "Nta. Your husband already agreed to your conditions when you started. He can't just expect you to compromise on your space last minute when he can already fix this situation on his own.

Really 100% NTA!!! it's his daughter! not yours! married or not. If he likes having her around, okay!, I understand that. But then he should rent you an alternative and pay for it himself and only if you agree to it. But to tell you that you're leaving your office, which you paid for, and then you're looking for a rental property, which again only you have to pay for... I don't understand how anyone comes up with this idea without feeling ashamed.", "NTA at all - worst case she can sleep on your couch! But it\u2019s your office, your place of work and how you get your income. Not to mention you paid for it. Your options to him are 100% reasonable.

That\u2019s your work space and you don\u2019t need to give it up for any reason.", "That's what the couch is for. If he's works and your in studio then she can crash on the couch for a little bit.

But you need a place with a kitchen and working appliances so that you can cook lunches and make snacks.", "Nta\n\nBonding on your dime and at the cost of your job? He has it easy.", "NTA, that's your office, where you earn your income. It would be different if you had an office at your place of employment (I.e. college) plus the at home office, but that's not the case.", "NTA. Make sure your studio stays locked & that he does not have a key. Install cameras in case he goes behind your back to try to remove your desk. They are all adults (including his daughter) and this is their problem to collectively solve.", "NTA, at all.  She can sleep on an air mattress in the living room or get a place with roommates.", "NTA, absolutely not.

That you already have, and paid for?", "Not your daughter, not your sacrifice.  He needs to go with your suggestion or tell him to leave and buy him out.", "NTA. He has no business offering his daughter this without consulting you. He doesn\u2019t want father-daughter bonding, he wants to save money.", "NTA \nI would not be surprised if he's planned this with his daughter.

You paid for it, increasing the value of the property you share, so it\u2019s yours to do with as you will.", "Your husband stinks.", "NTA\n\nAnd here is what i would do. I would tell him fine, i rent a studio. BUT, if i rent a studio, i'm gonna live there. I will NOT contribute to the house i'm not living in till i get my space back, so you and daughter will have to pay for everything on your own. Also he has to sign a written agreement that the costs for the studio (minus what you would had to pay to live in your own place) will be added \"to the house\" - so if you ever sell the house he has to reimburse you for this additional cost.", "NTA & tell him it's not in your place to lose income because he wants to have a father daughter moment and they (parents) want to save money. This isn't such big of a hill but it's one you should die on if it comes to that. Or you tell them to pay you money you used for installing it. If the place didn't exist his daughter would have found somewhere to live with mommy & daddy's help. It's not your fault or place to provide her with free accommodation on your own dime", "NTA\n\nFather and daughter can rent a place together and bond as much as they want whilst leaving you in peace, glorious peace.", "NTA, how about HE rents you an office whilst his daughter is using your office?", "Let me get this straight. He wants to transfer your money to his ex and daughter by giving the daughter something you paid for and having you pay again. It's along the lines of \"oh daughter, you can have the car your step-mom paid for and she can just buy herself another one cause she has money and you don't.\" Am I right?

To me it seems like a lot more talking needs to be done between the two of you.", "NTA good on you for not backing down .", "nta\n\nStand firm \n\nIf he wants bonding time with his daughter, suggest he rent a two bedroom.

Any expenses is on him.\n\nIf he insists that the home is the only solution, then he and ex wife can pay for a studio  for you to rent. You need to work and need an office to do the work in. I understand he wants to bond, but it shouldn\u2019t be at your expense. Also, he should have thought that his daughter, who is still in school, may not make it on her own and what was the plan if she didn\u2019t.

Well, not a FT one, you say, one month per year and in a house that could accommodate everyone.   Things have changed.   What you didn't account for is every parent is FT for the rest of their lives.  Kids will grow and have their own families, but parents are still on speed dial at any moment for their adult children. \n\n And now here you are having made a stand.   Against a parent.   There's no other argument to be made by your husband... being a parent is valid in itself and no amount of logic or financial cost or strong declarations can overcome this fact.

Ridiculous.", "NTA - tbh, she can just sleep in the living room lol", "NTA, but you have a bigger problem than that thought. Your husband is putting you aside for his adult daughter. Your comfort. Your job. They don't matter. That is now your role in life, should you choose to accept it. Is this how you want to live the rest of your life? \n\nGood luck.", "NTA - your husband can rent his daughter a studio", "You won't have more earnings than he does if you lose your job over not having a decent place to teach from. NTA!", "NTA- he can rent an apartment for her, nearby.", "NTA. Even if you earn more, his daughter has a mother that is not you. Ergo; she\u2019s not your responsibility.", "don't back down", "She could have worked 2 part time jobs,  to get the income she needed. Right now they are so many fast food places looking. That's what you do when you need to. That's what an adult word do. \n\nEveryone losses a job at some point because of companies downsizing or fired for too many call outs (if that's what happened) . \n\nYour husband works, ideally at some point his daughter be working. Therefore the only \"father-daughter\" bonding that will be taking place is after work and weekends -- unless your husbandplans to wuit his job to hang out with his daughter.... She can come over for dinner each night or meet somewhere for dinner. PLUS if he hasn't bonded by now,  he never will.\n\nI'd suggest that he pay for your off- site ofice while his daughter has your studio you built,  but what happens when he decides to stop paying?  Because i get the feeling that's what he'd do. He'll start paying but then it would be on you to continue paying the rent.\n\nShe can also look into rooms to rent. People needing roommates,  house that have a bedroom to rent, or even move in with a friend. \n\nI knew someone who slept on their parents property in a tent with a camping heater in the winter. They were fine.  \n\nIf you have a garage, set up cot and heater. \n\nThere's your sofa or air mattress in the living room. She'll have to deal with everyone's schedules and you watching tv.\n\nShe's 23 years old.  Why the heck isn't she done?\n\nThis is his daughter, this is not your financial responsibility. It doesn't matter who makes more money.  He does not get to tell your how to spend your money. Ever  \n\nThe other concern is once she moves in,  she may never move out. At least not for a significant amount of time. \n\nIt's amazing that you paid for your office to be built and he wants to kick you out. \n\nNTA - don't give in. That's for studio.", "Show her where the couch is.", "NTA. Have you looked at mini houses they are basically one room houses the size of a bedroom. There are also single room finished \u201csheds\u201d that would provide a room.", "NTA and don\u2019t back down! I presume you have a sofa. She can sleep on that for a few nights. But she needs to find a job and find a place fast and her parents should help her with that. \n\nBTW, she\u2019s been in college for 5 years and she\u2019s still going? Is she in grad school now or has she not graduated?", "Tell him she can sleep on the couch! NTA", "NTA OP... You need to work > He needs to take financial reaspobnsinility and find an alternate way to increase Dad and Daughter time .", "Kinda YTA yeah. She\u2019s your kid, essentially. As a parent you need to be unselfish and help out when you can. Not saying you need to rent her a place or something but allowing her a bedroom seems like a pretty small thing. If you didn\u2019t want a family, you probably shouldn\u2019t have married the guy.", "The daughter should be on the couch and a new, sturdy deadbolt with one key needs to be installed in your studio. I see her never getting a job or leaving and her dad enabling her. He has plenty of money so he can rent a studio for her but she will not be let into the studio you paid for. He doesn't want to spend a dime of his own money. NTA", "Agreed this is to save him HIS money. \n\nHusband didn't offer to pay for work rental space for OP, instead he told OP to use her own money.\n\nOP paid for the work studio to be built by herself -- guessing because her husband (who should be supportive) refused. \n\nHe doesn't respect her.\n\nSounds like she could probably do ok on her own too.", "OP said her husband said she makes more money than he does,  so she can pay for off-site work studio while his daughter takes over the work studio she paid to be built. \n\nShe also said he's not poor. \n\nI'm thinking he's CHEAP.  He paid  NOTHING towards the cost to extend the house to build a the work studio.  This space is all hers. \n\nNow he wants to capitalize on it by kicking his wife out and moving his 23 year old daughter in.", "Great idea. Or a cheap camper.\n\nReally hope OP keeps her studio and tells husband to man up and use his own money.", "This isn't about studio or daughter.   This is about OPs disdain for the daughter and hubby's disdain for OP.    This is why I say I expect better of everyone.   And why compromise beyond the only two solutions found is required or there is no marriage.", "And yes! If it's AN EMERGENCY she can sleep on a pull-out.", "It's so bizarre to me.  He sounds super selfish.", "There is already an office, don\u2019t need to build a \u201cshed\u201d for it.  Daughter can have the \u201cshed\u201d", "Honestly, I\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t have them already given that she houses her equipment, etc. there and there is potentially access to private information in her office.", "Being family works both ways.  So why is it OK for husband and step daughter to take advantage of OP?  What would they do if OP never built the studio? If hudand wants his daughter close by, he needs to figure it out without negatively impacting his wife."]}
