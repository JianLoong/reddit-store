My husband (59) and I (53) have been together for 10 years, married for 8. My kids and I started staying with him about 3 months after we met. He was behind on all of his bills, and I ended up taking over all household expenses except the mortgage ($550/mo). I had a decent career, and could almost afford to do this, but I did lose my small house because I couldn\u2019t afford to keep it and pay the other expenses as well. \n\nWhen we married he filed a quit claim, legally adding me to his property deed. Last year, he was offered a job two states away. The kids were grown and moved out, so I resigned my position, we sold the house, and have been living in a travel trailer in campgrounds in our new state. We used the proceeds from the sale to buy two decent used vehicles, the older model camper we live in, and put the rest in a savings account in my name, because no bank will give him an account due to past banking history. The plan was to use this to buy property in our new state, when we find what we want. \n\nI found a job making much less than my previous, and net about $700 every two weeks. His hourly is 2-1/2 times mine. He still pays no living expenses, and I have had to use a bit of our savings each month to keep everything paid. Lot rent alone is $800. \n\nHe has recently started his 4th job since we moved. A month after getting his 3rd job, he told them he was looking for a new one and they let him go. He had nothing lined up, and has gone 6 weeks with no paycheck. I put fuel in his truck and bought him tobacco, and of course kept the bills paid. \n\nFriday morning I was leaving to visit my kids in our home state. After leaving for work, he texted and told me to leave him $100, and that he would be paid Monday. I don\u2019t carry much cash. Knowing at most he only needed fuel for the 30 miles to work Monday morning, I left the $15 I had and headed out. About halfway there, I got another text message that said they were holding his first check, and I needed to give him $500 for the week. He got very angry when I did not turn around and go back to give him cash I didn\u2019t have, and told me to \u201cstay the f*** up there\u201d. \n\nWhen I got to our home state, I sent him $175 of the $200 in my checking account via Western Union , because it was an instant transfer vs 3-4 days from a bank account. He called and cussed me out, saying it wasn\u2019t enough to get him through the week, even though he\u2019s only working 3 days due to a holiday. He again demanded I send him $500. I said $190 should be plenty for fuel, and he again told me not to bother coming back. He said that since I \u201cblew $500\u201d over Labor Day for my share of airfare, hotel and rental car to travel with my two oldest children (32 & 30) to attend the unexpected funeral of their father, I \u201cowe\u201d him that much from savings. \n\nAITA for refusing to send him more than he could possibly need, and almost as much as I bring home in two weeks, knowing he isn\u2019t paying any bills?", "created_utc": 1700450586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zf35n/aita_for_not_sending_my_husband_500/", "score": 2276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s almost like you really have to live it to understand. \n\nNote that this guy took her away from her friends (and any family that might have lived nearby). That\u2019s isolation. He probably also tried to get her not to talk to friends and family, and I\u2019m sure he gave her a hard time about visiting her children. The more he can isolate her, the more she will have to depend on him for everything. \n\nAnother thing abusers do is chip away at your self confidence\u2014 slowly, so you don\u2019t realize it\u2019s happening: \n\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to wear\u2026*that* tonight?\u201d \u201cYou know\u2026that dress makes you look a little chunky.\u201d \nEven after sex - \u201cMmmm, your tummy\u2019s so soft and squishy! It makes a great pillow.\u201d\n\nAll of these are things my abuser said to me. He also said he didn\u2019t like each outfit I wore, so I finally told him to look through my closet and tell me what he did like. He went through it, shook his head, and said, \u201cThere\u2019s just not anything.\u201d Fabulous for your self-esteem, that. \n\nMy abuser also refused to allow me to wear makeup. He would get furious if he saw me with any.\n\nThere\u2019s lots more, but if an abuser isolates you from the people who see what\u2019s going on and could convince you to leave, and if he (although there certainly are shes!) can strip you down to a  shell of your former self, you\u2019ll pretty much do anything for him, and you\u2019ll be absolutely *petrified* at the idea of a life without him. You are nothing/have nothing without him! Since you have no self-esteem, it really feels like you *will die* without him. THAT is why people go back.  \n\nUntil you can get some therapy and build back some of your self, you really are nothing without him, and that\u2019s just a horrible way to have to live. Going back to him makes you feel whole again, at least until things get bad again. \n\nI was a strong, confident young woman when I went back to college my sophomore year. I was also very na\u00efve. I became completely enamored by the cute, muscley gymnast who lived across the hall from me, and when he took an interest in me, I fell head over heels very quickly. \n\nBy Christmas I was a shaking, nervous wreck, and by April, I had absolutely no self esteem left at all. I followed him around like a puppy no matter how horrible he was to me. I thought I deserved it all. \n\nI stayed with that boy until he literally tried to choke me to death in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot one sunny day in May after a very drunken float in a raft down a long, winding river (throughout which he had quietly called me a \u201cdisgusting cunt,\u201d a \u201cpussy faced bitch,\u201d a \u201cpathetic whore,\u201d and a \u201cfucking desperate wannabe\u201d among many other delightful expletives, all while glaring at me with the meanest, scariest look I\u2019ve ever seen. He also repeatedly yanked down the top of my bathing suit, which was loads of fun since he and two other gymnasts were sitting across from us girls, so the boys all got to enjoy the show).\n\nAfter the attack, which took two gymnasts to pull him off me, I failed all my exams and went home for the summer to lick my wounds. \n\nUltimately, I survived and have become much wiser as a result of those events. In a way I feel like they\u2019ve ultimately made me a stronger person, but it took two years before I could sleep in a room alone and a good 10 years to really feel like myself again.\n\nAn interesting note: I was among the fortunate few who later got to talk candidly with my ex (we were in college, and two years after we dated, we were in the same class (in a college of 35,000, go figure) that neither of us could drop or get into another section of. \n\nFirst, he admitted he only asked me out in the first place to get back at my roommate, who had gone out with him a couple of times the year before but then dumped him (she could have cared less lol). \n\nHe also admitted he didn\u2019t want me to wear makeup so other guys wouldn\u2019t look at me. He never did tell me what made him so mad on the rafting trip, but he did admit that there were many, many nights when he\u2019d held his pillow and had to talk himself out of smothering me with it. Lovely. \n\nFinally, he said he could never date anyone else because he knew for sure he\u2019d kill her. \n\nLast I heard of him (about 10 years ago), he was on the other side of the country working in graphic design.  I googled him more recently, though, and I couldn\u2019t find any sign of him. \n\nJust a bit alarming.", "I hope she has some proceeds from home sale left.", "I absolutely agree he\u2019s abusive and she should stay away - maybe with one of her adult children if possible. \n\nI do have to say I find it suspicious that \u201cno bank will give him an account due to past banking history.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine any bank refusing to open an account for you if you\u2019re standing there holding $400 in cash. It\u2019s been a while since I opened a new account, but I\u2019m about 95% sure no bank does a credit check or looks into your past banking history when you open a new account with a new bank.
