My husband (59) and I (53) have been together for 10 years, married for 8. My kids and I started staying with him about 3 months after we met. He was behind on all of his bills, and I ended up taking over all household expenses except the mortgage ($550/mo). I had a decent career, and could almost afford to do this, but I did lose my small house because I couldn\u2019t afford to keep it and pay the other expenses as well. \n\nWhen we married he filed a quit claim, legally adding me to his property deed. Last year, he was offered a job two states away. The kids were grown and moved out, so I resigned my position, we sold the house, and have been living in a travel trailer in campgrounds in our new state. We used the proceeds from the sale to buy two decent used vehicles, the older model camper we live in, and put the rest in a savings account in my name, because no bank will give him an account due to past banking history. The plan was to use this to buy property in our new state, when we find what we want. \n\nI found a job making much less than my previous, and net about $700 every two weeks. His hourly is 2-1/2 times mine. He still pays no living expenses, and I have had to use a bit of our savings each month to keep everything paid. Lot rent alone is $800. \n\nHe has recently started his 4th job since we moved. A month after getting his 3rd job, he told them he was looking for a new one and they let him go. He had nothing lined up, and has gone 6 weeks with no paycheck. I put fuel in his truck and bought him tobacco, and of course kept the bills paid. \n\nFriday morning I was leaving to visit my kids in our home state. After leaving for work, he texted and told me to leave him $100, and that he would be paid Monday. I don\u2019t carry much cash. Knowing at most he only needed fuel for the 30 miles to work Monday morning, I left the $15 I had and headed out. About halfway there, I got another text message that said they were holding his first check, and I needed to give him $500 for the week. He got very angry when I did not turn around and go back to give him cash I didn\u2019t have, and told me to \u201cstay the f*** up there\u201d. \n\nWhen I got to our home state, I sent him $175 of the $200 in my checking account via Western Union , because it was an instant transfer vs 3-4 days from a bank account. He called and cussed me out, saying it wasn\u2019t enough to get him through the week, even though he\u2019s only working 3 days due to a holiday. He again demanded I send him $500. I said $190 should be plenty for fuel, and he again told me not to bother coming back. He said that since I \u201cblew $500\u201d over Labor Day for my share of airfare, hotel and rental car to travel with my two oldest children (32 & 30) to attend the unexpected funeral of their father, I \u201cowe\u201d him that much from savings. \n\nAITA for refusing to send him more than he could possibly need, and almost as much as I bring home in two weeks, knowing he isn\u2019t paying any bills?", "created_utc": 1700450586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zf35n/aita_for_not_sending_my_husband_500/", "score": 581, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With the amount your paying you could easily live on your own with money to spare !!!", "NTA - at all!\n\nI\u2019m going to take a slightly different approach to this reply. Ppl who get themselves in these situations commonly have a background that has led to them overlooking others\u2019 flaws and being comfortable in the \u201chelper\u201d role. \n\nYou\u2019ve helped him enough. Your kids are grown and now out of the house. You *deserve* so much better than how he is treating you. You\u2019ve been able to hold down jobs and be financially responsible - in spite of him, not because of him. You don\u2019t owe him anything more. You do owe yourself more. \n\nPlease see a divorce lawyer and don\u2019t go back to him. I suspect this is just one more episode in a string of broken promises to pay you back, and ongoing requests for money (either directly, or a request to pay his share of bills that should\u2019ve been shared). It\u2019s time to end the cycle. \n\nPlease also try to see a counselor. He\u2019s gaslighting you, and taking advantage of you. He\u2019s being financially abusive and generally manipulative. You need some support of your own, so that you can gain confidence and not continue to succumb to his threats. \n\nI know a lawyer and counselor sound expensive, but without him dragging you down financially, I\u2019m confident you can get through this!

Your husband is clearly irresponsible and a leech. He is literally pulling you down with him !! Going from having a house to living in a car just because he can't even keep a job or have the decency to at least try to do so is insane.\nWorse is you are enabling him. You are making it easier for him not to have to be responsible for himself because he can always count you to cover his expenses.

I asked her why?  And she started thinking... and thinking.... and then a freaking light bulb went off on her head. She couldn't think of one good reason to stay with him.
