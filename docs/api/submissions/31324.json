{"id": 31324, "submission_id": "17zf35n", "title": "AITA for not sending my husband $500?", "selftext": "I apologize in advance for this being long. My husband (59) and I (53) have been together for 10 years, married for 8. My kids and I started staying with him about 3 months after we met. He was behind on all of his bills, and I ended up taking over all household expenses except the mortgage ($550/mo). I had a decent career, and could almost afford to do this, but I did lose my small house because I couldn\u2019t afford to keep it and pay the other expenses as well. \n\nWhen we married he filed a quit claim, legally adding me to his property deed. Last year, he was offered a job two states away. The kids were grown and moved out, so I resigned my position, we sold the house, and have been living in a travel trailer in campgrounds in our new state. We used the proceeds from the sale to buy two decent used vehicles, the older model camper we live in, and put the rest in a savings account in my name, because no bank will give him an account due to past banking history. The plan was to use this to buy property in our new state, when we find what we want. \n\nI found a job making much less than my previous, and net about $700 every two weeks. His hourly is 2-1/2 times mine. He still pays no living expenses, and I have had to use a bit of our savings each month to keep everything paid. Lot rent alone is $800. \n\nHe has recently started his 4th job since we moved. A month after getting his 3rd job, he told them he was looking for a new one and they let him go. He had nothing lined up, and has gone 6 weeks with no paycheck. I put fuel in his truck and bought him tobacco, and of course kept the bills paid. \n\nFriday morning I was leaving to visit my kids in our home state. After leaving for work, he texted and told me to leave him $100, and that he would be paid Monday. I don\u2019t carry much cash. Knowing at most he only needed fuel for the 30 miles to work Monday morning, I left the $15 I had and headed out. About halfway there, I got another text message that said they were holding his first check, and I needed to give him $500 for the week. He got very angry when I did not turn around and go back to give him cash I didn\u2019t have, and told me to \u201cstay the f*** up there\u201d. \n\nWhen I got to our home state, I sent him $175 of the $200 in my checking account via Western Union , because it was an instant transfer vs 3-4 days from a bank account. He called and cussed me out, saying it wasn\u2019t enough to get him through the week, even though he\u2019s only working 3 days due to a holiday. He again demanded I send him $500. I said $190 should be plenty for fuel, and he again told me not to bother coming back. He said that since I \u201cblew $500\u201d over Labor Day for my share of airfare, hotel and rental car to travel with my two oldest children (32 & 30) to attend the unexpected funeral of their father, I \u201cowe\u201d him that much from savings. \n\nAITA for refusing to send him more than he could possibly need, and almost as much as I bring home in two weeks, knowing he isn\u2019t paying any bills?", "created_utc": 1700450586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zf35n/aita_for_not_sending_my_husband_500/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm surprised you married and had kids with this man and have yet to have a serious talk about finances. Y'all both need to be on the same page for a lot of things to make a marriage work. Kinda impressed it took 10 years to get to this point.", "He told you to stay away?\n\nNYA. Take him up on it.", "It really shouldn\u2019t be this hard to be married to someone, why even go through all that from the beginning YOU had a great job/house and gave all that up to support an adult? I don\u2019t get it, but maybe some people just like being miserable. YTA\u2026for going through all that!!!", "NTA, he's exploiting you and he's also abusing you. Telling you he doesn't want you anywhere near him because you won't give him money he doesn't need, after all his other BS? I can't believe you've put up with him for so long. You do not \"owe him\" money, if he wants more he needs to work for it just like you do. Also where is his money going that he can't even support himself for one week?", "The guy has been bad with finances all his life. Like he has suggested, don\u2019t go back.

NTA", "nta. you've been shouldering the financial burden for far too long and it's about time your husband took responsibility for his own expenses. it's not fair for him to demand more money from you when you are already struggling to make ends meet. he needs to start contributing and stop relying on you to bail him out.", "If you were the one paying the bills, why did you quit your job to follow your husband to a new state?  Was he expecting a more lucrative position?  Had you discussed how your financial arrangements would change?  As in, he would now be paying for household bills?  Your income would probably decrease?  What exactly was the plan?\n\nI would stay with or near your children and your medical care.  Try to get a higher paying job back in your home state.  Get your name of any bills you\u2019re paying for new location and stop paying them.  Talk to a lawyer.  Luckily all your savings are in your name only.  Don\u2019t mess around and ruin your personal credit along with your husband.\n\nThis guy can\u2019t even have a savings account in his own name and he is kicking you to the curb?

Why are you allowing this? Your money is for the household and his money is for him? Grow a spine.  Mark storage finances but contribute to the hotels proteins to your income", "nta. it seems like your husband is taking advantage of your financial support without contributing his fair share. you're already going above and beyond by covering all the household expenses and dipping into savings to make ends meet. it's not unreasonable for you to refuse to send him more money especially when he's not paying any bills himself. he needs to take responsibility for his own finances instead of relying on you all the time.", "Why? Why are you still in this toxic relationship of yours?", "nta. your husband should be grateful for everything you've done for him and not demand even more. it's unfair for him to expect you to support him financially while he contributes nothing.", "nta. it's not fair for your husband to expect you to send him more money when you're already struggling to make ends meet and he's not contributing to the household expenses. you're doing your best to support both of you and he should be appreciative of that instead of demanding more money.", "NTA.

Just me alone I can make 500 last me a whole month between food and gas if my wife left town for awhile. I know this because her family lives halfway across the country and she's visited multiple times in our 10 years being together. I'ma say nta especially since he said *stay TF up there* and IMHO that would either be marriage counseling if not divorce on my part. Please consult a lawyer for a worse case scenario op and also make secondary living arrangements if this keeps on this is classic financial abuse", "Best advice, do exactly what your husband asked.
