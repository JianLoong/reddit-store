Almost every holiday my family has we also bring in new people for whatever reason ( alone, new to the area,ect) holidays should be that way. And since you two are in a commmited partnership, families should be interested in meeting each other.

On Mother\u2019s Day, honoring the mother who raised you and you love and respect. You should have been with her.  If your MIL is so self-centered as to want to only be about her, then she is entitled to her choice of saying no, but as such , she does not get to decide whether you attend her event or spend it with your actual mother. She does not get to choose what other do. She has no authority or control over you. \n\nAnd honestly it\u2019s appalling and extremely unfair for her or your partner to expect you to not spend the day with your own mother, just to spend it with someone who is only the in-law and not your actual mother.", "NTA. My mom is the MAIN mom that will be celebrated on Mother's Day. If my partner wants to celebrate with his mom, that's more than okay with me.

You should say you're sorry, not attend, but take your mom to the same thing since your mom enjoys it, and tell your MIL that the day is about your mom.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine how self-involved a person has to be to exclude their son\u2019s partner\u2019s mother from a Mother\u2019s Day activity on the basis that they \u201cwant the day to be all about\u201d themselves.

Your spending time with your own mother on Mother's Day shouldn't be an issue for anyone.\n\nAs nice as it would have been, your mother-in-law doesn't have to necessarily share her celebratory time with someone she doesn't know either.

That being said, some people get weirdly competitive, combatative, or both.", "ESH, you should try to get them together to meet at a time when it's more low key and not a time that she's already made plans for.", "NAH it was her activity so she can invite who she wants, and you have the right to attend or not as you see fit. If you want to have a combination celebration you should host.", "YTA.  Don't get me wrong, I applaud your loyalty and probably did the right thing but you did accept the invitation and then to try and invite someone when your not the host is a rude thing to do, even though all too many people do that.  \n\nI also think you're an AH for not thinking of your mom in the first place.  It's Mother's Day.  She's YOUR mother.  Why would you spend time with some else's mom when you have one of your own that needs to be celebrated?", "NTA\n\nI was going to say N A H till you said that your MIL said that she wanted the day to be all about her.\n\nShe does have the right to say no.  But you are also not her daughter.  The simplest solution would be that your partner goes to this event by himself and you spend the day with your mother.\n\nI'd love to say you take your mother to the same event but that would be poking the bear so don't.", "NAH.

(and your Partner's Mother sounds like rather self-absorbed person who may be an A-H.)\n\nIf you threw a fit about it or tried to insist that your mother attend that would have made you and A-H.  But just asking was perfectly reasonable because it's your Mother's Mother's Day too.\n\nThe question is, did your MIL throw a fit about you not attending, Or your partner, or is this your personal conscience bothering you?", "INFO: \n\nIt's January. Are you talking about last Mother's Day? Or is it a different day outside of the US?", "You are a wonderful daughter.\n\nNTA", "Exactly.

I work in the restaurant industry, and one year on Mother's Day, a group was upset that they didn't have a table by the window.  They asked if they could move but we told them that all the tables were booked. No joke, they whined \"But it's Mother's Day! It's a special day for us!\"", "You have a good point, OP wasn't even going to see his mother on mother's day, until he found out the activity. \n\nHe is the AH, but not for cancelling on mil, for being a shitty son.", "Wow, you encountered the only moms in the world.  /s", "Definitely NTA.  Never feel guilty for spending Mother's Day with your mother.  Geez", "NTA", "YTA .. inviting others while you are not planning it. It is the MIL's initiative isn't it?", "Nope!

How WILL she survive?", "Similar experience. Had someone call last minute for mother's day after we had been fully booked for days. We had one table that could sit 3 people but we usually only left it for walk-ins because it was right next to the register. There were constant people standing there waiting or paying or ordering. Overall not great spot. Amazing for the random odd single or couple who just wanted a quick bite and didn't want to worry about a reservation.\n\nConsidering the sob story she told me about her other reservation that got messed up or something I told her that I have one single table left but explained the situation about it. As it was Mother's Day I didn't want her to get a crappy table if it was something that would bother her.\n\nShe threw a fit asking why I couldn't just move a different party to that table and give her something nicer because it's mother's day and she deserves a nice table and it's not her fault the reservation for the other place got messed up. It was wild. Absolutely wild", "NTA so she expects you to ignore your own mother on mother's day?", "Wonder how she will cope if you or her daughter have kids.\n\nNTA spend the day with your mum and let your MIL have her \u201cI\u2019m the only mother in the world\u201d event.", "NTA sounds like you have a monster in law I am sorry but good for you for hanging with your mama", "I do have to give the MIL props for honesty though lmao.
