We were chilling with friend A and some other friends. \n\nFor context I always thought A is a bit cheap. He manipulates friends to pay for his food and etc. \n\nAfter we were done, we went to sleep without cleaning up and we talked about how we'll clean up when we wake up/before they leave. \n\nWe wake up a bit later than expected and A says that he is going to be late for an appointment he has 2 hours later which is plenty of time. He told me that because he only has 2 hours he doesn't have time to clean up and he needs to leave. I say that it's okay and not to worry. For about 5 to 10 minutes I fell asleep. When I wake up I hear sounds coming from the kitchen and I see A making himself a sandwich. This may be the part that makes me an AH. I tell him what is he still doing here and he says that he is making a sandwich before he leaves. I tell him no and take the ingredients from him and tell him that if he has time for making a sandwich, he can help clean up. He murmurs and doesn't say anything and then leaves.\n\nMy friend told me that what I did was not cool and could've been handled better.
