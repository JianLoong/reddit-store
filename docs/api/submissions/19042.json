It's possible she thinks you are one of those people and doesn't believe you actually don't want any gifts, but she really should take your word for it and not make assumptions.", "Mainly NTA ok it's fair it's your birthday so what you say should go. However, some people really enjoy gift giving and attempting to spoil their loved ones so it possibly wouldn't hurt bending the rules for your GF to let her have the joy spoiling you. If this is a total no go maybe suggest you as a couple start your own traditions, love notes, surprise experiences in other ways for her to show her love other than straight out gift giving.", "She is probably scared you won't get her a gift on her birthday.

I understand the mentality of feeling the *need* to give someone a gift. It's very ingrained into our culture and truly is a love language that some people have (like mine!). I love receiving gifts, but I also express my love in giving gifts. To not give someone a gift (especially my partner) is really hard as I want to show I care for them in the way my brain understands. I understand you believe it is a red flag that she doesn't listen to you, however you are both still young and developing those brains of yours. It might be hard for her to understand that gifts are a huge no to you because it's the way she feels like she shows love. Maybe when you both grow older she will look back and go 'Oh yeah that's not how his love language works' and she won't do it, but if time passes and year after year she doesn't change then maybe this isn't the person for you.  \n\n\nGood luck, OP! And happy early birthday.", "NAH gift giving may just be her love language and your Nta for not wanting gifts", "NTA. Get a new girlfriend.", "I\u2019d be fine with an experience, and told her that, but she insists on getting me an actual physical present", "I understand that, but I think expressing love includes understanding what the person would actually enjoy. For example, she\u2019s an introvert, so I wouldn\u2019t throw a party for her birthday and force her to attend, same principle here.", "Also a lot of people say they don\u2019t want a gift when they really do. It\u2019s just what some people do. Maybe ask for her to bake you something, make a card, or cook a meal you like instead? Should she really be punished for trying to be nice?

The event itself, maybe, but the tendency to ignore my preferences when it comes to important days for me is a red flag to me.", "> Your girlfriend wants to treat you and give you gifts\n\nThe key words here are \u2018your girlfriend\u2019.

That\u2019s pretty concerning", "I suggested just doing something cool together instead and she insisted on getting me a gift instead", "Why?", "I just feel it stops being nice when you explain you don\u2019t want something and they keep insisting on it. I tried a compromise by saying we could do a cool activity together, which I would enjoy more than a present, but she insists on a physical gift", "or maybe she can just get gift, most people don\u2019t involve the person in gift buying process", "How weird.. I would definitely respect your wishes and get you a big fat nothing to show my love. My friend's idea of heaven is for his friends and big extended family to forget he is alive for the whole of his birthday... and we all respect that.", "Well, break up with her then. \n\nHonestly, of course gift-giving is a two-way street - those who do it, usually also enjoy it. Accusing your gf, though, if making yout bday about herself only just because she follows a harmless tradition... It's not cool. Probably your gf's love language is gifts, while yours not, and it may be better for her to find someone who understands her better.", "yeah u two aren't compatible atp if ure this stubborn over a singular gift from someone who is meant ro be ur gf", "buddy its just ur birthday u can accept one gift even if u hate it", "As you get older you\u2019ll learn the concept of picking your battles.

It's great and reasonable compromise.\n\nI myself love giving (and getting) experiences, it's awesome gift and shows how well you know the other person.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited to add the judgement", "She\u2019s being obnoxious, you\u2019re over thinking a relationship that will be a distant memory in a year. Just say thanks", "Unfortunately the world we live in is one where people that do want gifts will insist that they really don't out of a misguided sense of politeness. Makes it really hard for your gf to believe that you actually don't want anything. \n\nThe cool activity thing sounds like a good compromise to me - do you know why she isn't ok with that? If it's that she wants you to unwrap something, she could always wrap some tickets.", "Ask for candy or something? It's small and doesn't take up permanent space, but she'll still feel like she's giving you a physical present.", "> Well, break up with her then\n\nIf this is a recurring pattern, I will.\n\n> Accusing your gf, though, if making yout bday about herself only just because she follows a harmless tradition... It's not cool\n\nI think the added details of my telling her repeatedly I don\u2019t want a present and her ignoring it change the situation. To draw an analogy, my girlfriend is an introvert and doesn\u2019t like parties. Birthday parties are also a harmless tradition, but if she told me she didn\u2019t want one, and I threw one anyways and forced her to come, I\u2019d be TA.", "> Is denying your girlfriend the ability to show her love/appreciation for you on your birthday a battle you are willing to have and are you willing let this be a hill you are willing to let the relationship die on?\n\nAgain, I\u2019ll reiterate\u2014 it\u2019s not about the gifts, it\u2019s about her demonstrating how she\u2019ll ignore my wishes and desires regarding things that are important to me. Today it\u2019s a birthday gift that she\u2019s overruling me on, who knows what it\u2019ll be tomorrow?

It's great and reasonable compromise.\n\nWill do", "I\u2019m not going to thank somebody for repeatedly ignoring my boundaries", "Please, break up with her already, she deserves better than someone who is contemplating a break-up over a bday gift.", "Sounds like you guys should just break up then. You are choosing to be stubborn about something relatively trivial. You are making something minor into a bigger thing. I stand by the YTA.", "Then break up with her. This is how she shows affection. Accept it or don\u2019t. ESH", "Alternatively, I deserve somebody that doesn\u2019t take my birthday and make it about their desires.

As for breaking up that\u2019s the plan if she continues this pattern", "That\u2019s definitely the plan if she continues it. As for it being how she shows affection, it\u2019s not hard to do things your partner actually likes instead of what you like.

Do you really have to be in control of everything around you?", "Kid it sounds like you don\u2019t want to seriously self reflect to see if you are in the wrong. You just want people to confirm your own feelings.", "Possibly. Or she has a compulsion to show affection with gifts. You have an inability to accept gifts.", "Sounds like you don't like that they disagree with your points and won't self reflect either.\nIf they hate getting physical gifts and express that as they say they've done why should they have to give up their boundaries etc just so someone else doesn't have to give up theirs? Relationships are all about compromise and as he has expressed happiness in receiving an experience instead she should compromise and get that. That way she has gifted and he hasn't had a physical item.\nEasy.", "She is repeatedly trying to get him to weigh in on a gift he doesn\u2019t want. That isn\u2019t nice, it\u2019s annoying. She is choosing to disregard his feeling for her wants which is selfish"]}
