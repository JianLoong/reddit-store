I don't think they're selfish for wanting to do IVF instead of adopting. Adopting isn't for everyone, and some people want to have a biological child, if they can. That preference isn't wrong, it's just their preference.\n\nHowever, your oldest sister IS selfish for expecting the family to pay for it, especially when they don't really have the means. Also, if your sister isn't in a position to afford the IVF procedure on her own, is she really in a good financial position to be having a child? I'm not so sure.", "ESH, except your parents. Is your sister selfish to want to do IVF? No. Is she selfish to expect others to pay for it? Yes. Was it understandable how you felt? Yes. Was it inappropriate to say what you did to her? Also yes.

It is incredibly personal. Infertility is heartbreaking for many. You were absolutely an asshole for what you said. And yes, you history has biased you. It\u2019s fine to advocate for adoption. You don\u2019t have to call someone selfish while you are doing that. \n\nYour sister is an AH because how you choose to have children should not become someone else\u2019s financial burden. But that\u2019s still not your conversation to have. That\u2019s your parents call.", "YTA It has nothing to do with you if they want to do IVF. They are starting a gofund me and hoping the parents help, they are not demanding they help. There's a difference.\n\nAlso, tell your sister to move to Massachusetts, health insurance in Massachusetts cover IVF.", "ETA. You are, for saying IVF is selfish. There is nothing selfish about wanting a biological child. And your sister is as well if she's banking on her parents paying for it when they can't afford it.", "Yup, didn't need to read anything but the title.  YTA", "YTA. Adoption is common in my family (both sides), but no one ever goes around saying they should only adopt instead of trying for biological children. I would have said NTA because I thought you objected to them wanting your family to pay for it, but since you say it's just the \"cherry on top\" it's clear that you have long-standing issues with not being your family's biological child and your defensiveness is translating into this notion that IVF is selfish. People don't NEED to be parents; when they decide to have kids they have the prerogative to decide what kind of parents they want to be. \n\nAlso, I feel like I need to point out that it isn't always cheaper to adopt than to do IVF. My first cousin adopted twice AND did IVF--guess what cost more? Each adoption cost her more than the IVF, so from a purely practical perspective it would have cost her less to just keep trying for a biological child. She says she doesn't regret a cent she spent to have any of her kids, though, which is why it's so telling to me that you're using the cost to justify why IVF \"in general\" is selfish. \n\nI hope you think your feelings through and apologize. You were right to be concerned about your parents paying for the IVF, as it is expensive, but you overstepped.", "ESH. I don\u2019t think ivf in itself is necessarily selfish, but I say this as a person who is extremely fertile and never had an issue getting pregnant. Sure it\u2019s expensive, but there are a lot of reasons why adoption doesn\u2019t suit every couple and adoption in many cases is even pricier than ivf. \n\nHowever, I do agree it is obnoxious and selfish for anyone to expect others to fund their IVF. In 3 years of trying for a baby they haven\u2019t saved ANY money for their future children? That is just poor planning. Because you know they will also be expecting gifts for their child in the form of a baby shower, gender reveal, etc. It would be one thing if they privately spoke to your parents and asked for a loan or financial assistance, but announcing a go-fund-me and expecting others to contribute would annoy the shit out of me too. \n\nThere are also companies like Home Depot and Starbucks that have insurance which covers fertility treatment including ivf if their own insurance doesn\u2019t cover it. \n\nHOWEVER I don\u2019t think you telling them that is the right thing either. I don\u2019t know if there is a good way to say it at all. It\u2019s one of those things where even if it rubs you the wrong way (which I totally understand), unfortunately everyone is entitled to their own opinion and your sister isn\u2019t in the wrong just because she wants to pursue ivf over adoption.", "ESH IF and only IF they actually expect your parents to pay for it. Never have an opinion or comment like this on someone else's fertility issues.", "ESH\n\ny t a on your stance on IVF. \nn t a on your financial concern. I do think it's tacky for them to start a gofundme and ask your parents to front much of the cost. \n\nIf they can't afford the IVF themselves, how can they afford to raise a child?", "YTA- I really hate when people use \"adopt or foster\" to people who want to go through IVF. Not everyone wants to go that route, and that's OK. Your sister isn't forcing anyone to pay, and she has every right to set up a fund me account. Stop being so judgmental. Infertility is really hard, and family who judge the path they choose makes it so much more difficult.", "YTA. Adoption is a costly endeavor just like IVF. She\u2019s not selfish for wanting to carry her own child rather than adopt. While she shouldn\u2019t be expecting your parents to front the money, you\u2019re letting your own history with adoption influence your feelings and you should have definitely not said what you did the way you did. \n\nHer wanting a child and how she gets that child is really none of your business. If your parents decide to help her, that\u2019s also none of your business as long as it\u2019s not your personal money being used.", "ESH - If they are expecting / forcing your parents to help pay a lot of the cost then they suck because it is up to them to provide payment, or to get it voluntarily through the GoFundMe. But they shouldn't expect that your parents cover the cost. \n\nYou suck because of your view on IVF. A person isn't selfish for going through IVF, if they can afford to do. Also I have an adopted niece and nephew, and adoption is not as cheap as people tend to think that it is (at least not in the US). In all likelihood, if they were to adopt then would probably still need financial assistance to do so.", "YTA - You overstepped. Adoption is great, but it is not for everyone. All sorts of things get factored into that decision, it is not simply about people wanting their kids to be biologically related. Also, adoption is not a no cost or even low cost option. Them choosing IVF over adoption is not a personal attack on you. How they decide to grow their family is up to them, even if they are asking other to help with the costs. Whether your parents can/want to contribute financially is up to them.", "YTA. Don\u2019t give money if you font want to", "YTA, they can ask for money to help, but no one is obligated to give it.  How they choose to create their family is their business. Adoption is an expensive process, often more expensive than IVF. Fostering does not often lead to adoption as the goal is reunification. The kids available for adoption through the state are generally older and come with a lot of mental and physical disabilities that most people are not capable of handling. You\u2019re free to have an opinion, and feel like they should do it the way you would, but voicing that to them makes you an AH.", "You should never be afraid to ask for help. Whether people choose to help them is entirely up to them.", "ESH\n\nThe foster to adoption system is a total mess.  Telling them to just adopt isn\u2019t necessarily the answer.  They can try, but infant adoption is rare and expensive, and older children often have a lot of trama.  They need help, they need families, and the system is often as much in the way as actually helpful.   So, while well intentioned, your comment is not necessarily realistic.  \n\nThey are AH to expect the family to pay for IVF though.  IVF is expensive and often unreliable. While many do have success, often people spend $25K to $200K to achieve a pregnancy or even spend it and never achieve a pregnancy.  \n\nThey can dream, but to expect everyone else to blow their savings on a potential pregnancy is unrealistic.", "If they can\u2019t afford the IVF they shouldn\u2019t expect others to pay for it. However, adoption is very expensive too.", "i think YTA for thinking IVF is selfish, for some people its their only option to have a baby if they dont adopt. But shes TA too for expecting parents to pay up.", "YTA, it's your sisters choice to get IVF or not. \"Just adopt,\" is bullshit advice. It's a solution for some people, but not for others.\n\nNow your sister also kind of sucks for expecting your parents to pay for it apparently, but you should've probably bring this up with her and your parents in private, not when they're announcing it. Besides, the best way to deal with that is to just let the gofundme dry up. If people want to pay they will.", "YTA. \n\nFirstly it doesn't sound like they actually asked for money from your parents at all, they simply explained what they were doing and their plans to find it and you interpreted a \"look\".\n\nOther than that, infertility, IVF and adoption are very personal things, they are very big and very difficult decisions to make and there are so so many reasons people will choose one over the other. People going through infertility don't need others opinions on what YOU think is best. Believe me when I say the likelihood is they have had A LOT of conversation about their options. \n\nIf you're ever in the position they are in, then you're free to make whatever feels right for you. But what's right for you, isn't going to be right for everyone.", "YTA\nIt's not selfish if they want biological children and have the experience of a pregnancy. They aren't AH to ask their families for money. And it's also not so easy to \"just adopt a kid\". Your arguments are valid, but you did not find the right words for her situation.\n\nIt would have been better to tell them: I'll hope you find a way and we wish you all the best, but sorry we can not contribute more than XX. E.g. I would give my siblings 500\u20ac as a symbol of support. When something is very important for a family member or friend, always be sensitive when you want to say something negative about it.", "YTA- Infertility is an incredibly sensitive subject for most women and it was probably incredibly hard for them to share that they were having these types of difficulties. There is no shame in wanting a biological child. The fact that you couldn't help yourself and insulted your sister who is struggling is horrible. \n\nIt was incredibly inconsiderate on your part. You assumed their intentions while forgetting that charity is a voluntary action. So if your parents don't want to help or can't they don't have to.", "Yeah, sorry to say, YTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to volunteer that. Some thoughts are best kept to yourself.", "YTA\nAdoption costs money, too!\nAlso she didn\u2019t demand money she just looked hopeful.\nJust tell your sister to move to Massachusetts or another sane state where insurance covers IVF.", "YTA. I see where you\u2019re coming from, but adoption fees start around $25k and go up from there. It\u2019s a costly endeavor all around and you can still wait for years to be matched with a child. At the end of the day it\u2019s their decision, and they\u2019re going to quickly learn you can\u2019t get blood from a stone if they think your folks will be paying for it. Let them figure it out for themselves.", "NTA, but it is close.  Expecting the family to pay for your IVF is an AH maneuver.  Your sister is being selfish for that.  If she just wanted IVF instead of adopting, that would not be selfish, nor make her an AH.  You really need to separate the two.\n\nBTW - I would have stopped your sentence after\n\n>I told them they were being selfish for spending money the family doesn\u2019t have just to have a biological child\n\nThat is fair.  Your comment after that is a non-sequitur.", "You are NTA mostly\n\nYou are right about\u2026.\n\n- them asking your parents for $$$.

It's also NYB if your parents choose to help them fund it.  You're allowed to have an opinion, and everyone else is allowed to disagree with you.", "ESH\n\nYou suck for automatically dismissing your sister's feelings and struggles. They suck for expecting someone else to pay for it.\n\n\nDid they explicitly say they want mom and dad to pay for it, or was it something that might have been implied?", "YTA How people choose to bring children into the world is none of your f\\*\\*king business.

You're both assh\\*\\*es.", "YTA. \n\nA GoFundMe is not a mandatory commitment, it is a request. And IVF is not inherently a selfish decision, many people make that decision after a lot of reflection as it is expensive on top of being a mental, emotional and physical challenge with no guaranteed pay off. \n\nAdoption can be a wonderful option for people who have the capacity to do it, but the expectation or hope of being able to carry a child is one that a lot of people have. When your body doesn't allow you to do so, it can be a hard thing to let go. \n\nI can see where you may have been trying to come from but your words were unnecessary and I think you need to grant your sister the room to go on the journey to create her family as her and her partner see fit.", "NTA.\n\nNot because it's selfish to do IVF. It is selfish to expect everyone else to pay for them to do IVF to have a bio kid.", "So be one? How many children are you fostering?

How are they planning to raise their children if they don\u2019t have money for IVF?

Your sister isn't being selfish for wanting IVF but if she can't afford it, well the begging/gofundme option is there but expecting your parents to front up a chunk of the cost is massively selfish.", "NTA. You're absolutely right. \n\nWhile I agree with you on a sensible/moral/etc level. I feel this would still be an entirely different issue if your sister and her husband were paying for it themselves.

My sister went through fertility treatments and found out her health insurance would *retroactively* cover her treatments once a pregnancy was confirmed.  So, a person raises money for IVF and their insurance will cover once the pregnancy is confirmed.  The person gets pregnant, and their insurance company *reimburses* the entire amount they spent on the treatments.

So yes, to a lot of people it is very important.
