We like baseball, but we don't attend many games, so traveling into the city to see games is a rare treat. I know, though, that it would take time to drive there and find parking, due to traffic. Because the game started at 7 PM, and we live about 45 minutes from the stadium, I told her this morning that she needed to be ready to get in the car and go by 6 PM. \n\nWell, my wife is an avid gamer, so she was engrossed in her latest video game when the clock struck 5:45 PM. She has struggled to plan in the past, and I get tired of reminding her that she needs to budget time to get ready. It's as if she has no concept of time at all, similar to a young child. Well, I was ready to go by 6 PM, and she was in the bathroom. I saw this as an opportunity to teach her personal responsibility, so I simply left the house without saying a word, got in the car, and started driving to the game.\n\nIt took my wife a few minutes to figure out what I had done, but when she called me, she was absolutely furious. She said that it was a completely unacceptable move for me to leave without telling her and that she now had no way to get to the game without paying for parking. I told her that I got tired of constantly waiting for her and that she would plan better next time if she didn't want to get left behind. I also reminded her that I had told her that morning when I expected her to be ready to leave. Absolutely none of this seemed to matter, though, and she rudely hung up on me after yelling out more insults.\n\nFrankly, I think it's completely insane that a grown woman is unable to budget her time, and I'm starting to suspect that she is doing this on purpose because she's a narcissist who expects me to accommodate her. After all, she's not a dumb woman. She has a science degree. Well, she never showed up to the stadium, and I didn't hear from her the whole game, but when I got home, there was a note on the door. She told me that I wasn't welcome in the bedroom and that I should sleep on the couch. I can't believe she wants to be this much of a pill. If I had waited for her, I would have missed the first pitch. I made my expectations clear, and she couldn't be bothered to meet them. I feel like she should be apologizing to me.

You waited until she was in the bathroom and couldn't see you to leave to \"teach her a lesson\" (while she was actively getting ready and nearly done by your timeline of just a couple minutes to notice you were gone). You are infantalizing her and she was literally just a couple minutes behind you. She is not the pill here. You're a whole entire chore.", "YTA.  First of all, it's baseball. The game goes on interminably and it's not as if they don't seat you if you miss the first 10 minutes. Secondly, she was in the bathroom preparing and was a few minutes from being ready. Your response was disproportionate. Thirdly, you did not lay out the extreme consequences ahead of time. That probably wouldn't have saved you from AH status, but then it would have been more of her choice. Fourthly, your wife, as u/johnhodgman would point out, is a human being in her own right. She is not your child for you to discipline if she falls short of your standards.\n\nYou know she doesn't budget her time well. Let her know well beforehand if it's an important event. Reminding her an hour ahead of time and every 15 minutes after that, for instance. If you plan to do something so severe in the future, discuss that with her ahead of time.", "YTA. My partner is CONSTANTLY late and is the furthest from \"narcissistic\" it's literally an ADHD symptom. \n\nYou passive aggressively leaving, and trying to \"teach her a lesson\" like that tho?

YTA.", "Divorce her if you hate her this much", "YTA. This is your wife, right? Not your sibling, friend, etc? Like, you care about her and love her, right? Yes, it fucking sucks waiting for someone who has no time management skills. But again, this is your wife. You don\u2019t pull this to teach a grown woman a lesson. \n\nHave you ever heard of executive function? Your wife seems to be drastically lacking in it. You, my friend, just might be married to someone with undiagnosed ADHD or some other neurodivergence. What this woman, who you love, needs is compassion and quite possibly a neurological assessment. If you guys don\u2019t figure this out, your marriage may not be headed down a path toward forever. \n\nYou owe her an apology and then you need to be her ally in figuring this out. Good luck.", "YTA. No doubt.", "OP is very passive-aggressive. Has OP reflected on his own behaviour? Perhaps he's not so great to live with himself. His poor wife.", "YTA \n\nWhy did you marry someone you don\u2019t like?", "ESH. She should have planned better. You could have told her she has 1 minute and your leaving.", "YTA. I get that it\u2019s annoying when your partner doesn\u2019t budget time the same way you do (oh boy TRUST ME, do I know!). But also you yourself have said that is a well-known aspect of your partner that you are very familiar with. So, in other words, you\u2019ve decided to \u201cpunish\u201d your wife for being who she is and has always been. Wtf? \n\nLook, the mature and non-assholish thing to do would have been to sit her down for a talk long ago to be like, \u201cOkay so how do we manage this time management together?\u201d You\u2019re PARTNERS, or supposed to be, so this is an issue to tackle jointly. And, yes, consequences \u2014 like leaving her behind \u2014 can be part of that mutually agreed upon plan.\n\nBut you didn\u2019t do that. Because YTA. And you\u2019d rather just behave like a child and leave without saying a word and without voicing in advance that was an option on the table. Not cool.\n\nETA: Also for the record I\u2019m a huge baseball fan and so is my fianc\u00e9. So boohoo you missed the first pitch. There are literally hundreds more pitches coming. Was being there for a few more pitches worth this rift with your wife? You could have had a lovely 7 innings, say, had you checked your attitude.", "YTA. Leaving without her\u2026 might be an AH move, but not necessarily. Leaving without communicating\u2026 definitely an AH move. You were being petty. \n\nIf you had said: \n\u201cI\u2019m leaving in two minutes. If you\u2019re not in the car by then, I\u2019m leaving without you.\u201d\nthen you might not be sleeping in the couch. But you made this bed. Try to get comfortable, I guess.\n\nEdit to add:\nEven if you didn\u2019t give her warning and just said something to the effect of \u201cIt\u2019s 6pm. I\u2019m leaving for the game now. Bye.\u201d That would be far better than to silently sneak away. \n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that you left. The problem is that you didn\u2019t communicate.", "YTA. Leaving without her? Meh, not the best, kinda dickish. Not telling her? Or even giving a warning? Big big YTA, give her a chance. \n\nALSO: have you considered she has adhd and/or time blindness? Budgeting time is HARD and sometimes people forget things. I know a reminder in the morning for something happening in the evening doesn\u2019t always work for me, and I do need a reminder to do something about an hour before needing to go sometimes. Your reminder earlier in the day might not have been the right reminder time she needed. Not something that makes Y T A and truly a N A H type of deal, but something to consider and for you both to work on.", "Yta. You must be a newlywed because no sane husband should ever think it's a good idea to \" teach thier wife a lesson\".", "YTA for leaving without saying anything. You were being petty by not even letting her know that you were leaving. I would have voted the other way had you told her that you were leaving. \n\nYou guys need therapy.", "Yta for just going. I can see why you would be annoyed, but open the door say I am starting the car you have 5 mins .  \nOr start telling her you want to leave 1/2 hour before you actually need too.   \n\nPeople like this are annoying,  but find ways to work with it.", "Why are y'all still married.", "She needs to be evaluated for adult ADHD.  Time blindness is a noted characteristic for females, and has nothing to do with intelligence.", "YTA. You are not her parent, it is not your place to \u2018punish\u2019 her by leaving her without warning. Partners who insist on parenting their spouses are walking red flags.", "YTA\n\nFor a few reasons. First off even with your storytellers bias there's some problematic red flag language that I think you are probably not as innocent as you believe.\nYour verbage is degrading and talks down about her a bit.\n\nSecondly if you're going to go ahead with this you need to draw that line ahead of time. Now I've known some chronically late people and I agree that sometimes you have to put your foot down, but to do it without setting up the expectation is a bit more crass than have you said this is my plan I'm leaving at this time you always have this problem so I'm letting you know now yada yada yada.\nBut no, you just arbitrarily decided you're going to pull this this time and maybe she'd have been 5 minutes late but if she's in the bathroom maybe she was just putting herself together quick and you'd have still had enough time.\n\nFurthermore you know how I deal with light people? I'd have told her 5:30 is the departure time. Was chronically late people You need to give them the cushion.\n\nIt sounds to me like she is not the narcissist in this situation, but she may have her focusing flaws that cause her problems of time. And you decided to throw an impromptu tantrum.", "There was an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond very much like this.  She was always late, yadda yadda, this time he drove off when she was in the bathroom without a goodbye.  Turned out her head was stuck under the sink and that\u2019s how he found her hours later when he returned.  Fireworks ensued.  We can all learn from his mistake.  YTA", "YTA for not telling her you were leaving.  Not that you left without her.", ">I'm starting to suspect that she is doing this on purpose because she's a narcissist who expects me to accommodate her\n\nYes of course she is the narcissist because she had time management issues, it couldn't possibly be that you are the narcissist with control issues. \n\n>I saw this as an opportunity to teach her personal responsibility\n\nNo you saw this as an opportunity to humiliate your wife and feel superior. All you taught your wife is that she is married to a self-centered jerk. How do you know that you didn't trigger some deep trauma she has about being abandoned, or even confirm a fear she has. No you decided that seeing the first pitch was more important than your wife so I hope you enjoy the couch you peice of s*** YTA", "ESH. You should have said you are leaving. However, she is a grown woman, it's not your job to babysit her and make sure she gets dressed in time. Sure, a reminder is nice, but she can set an alarm on her phone. She doesn't respect you, though it also seems like you no longer respect her, which is fair.", "ESH - it\u2019s not that hard to call out and say \u2018hey babe. Leaving in fifteen minutes!\u2019 And she can set a timer on her phone. I can see why you\u2019re annoyed but the power play hurts your marriage. It\u2019s not about winning.", "ESH. It would have been better if you said something before leaving. I get the mental load that comes with being the reminder for someone with executive function issues. It can be frustrating. It can come across as self absorbed behaviour A lot of people having a go at you likely sympathise with your wife (e.g. having a diagnosis of ADHD). I have Autism and ADHD, however as part of adulting you need to learn strategies to deal with day to day stuff. If she games excessively there is fair chance she has an addiction issue which is common in neurodivergent peoples.", "ESH. If you\u2019re going to take a hard line like this you need to communicate it either in advance or as it\u2019s happening.", "YTA. What did you expect the outcome to be by pulling this fast one on her? You thought, she\u2019d come out of the bathroom, ready to go, looking for you, see you gone and think, \u201cgee, that will teach me for being late. My poor husband had to leave without me. I\u2019ll just apologize when he gets home\u201d get real. You snuck out without so much as a word, and treated a baseball game as more important than your marriage and communication with your spouse. This is the person you are supposed to love more than anyone/anything else on earth. To do anything for. Til death do you part, \u201cunless it\u2019s first pitch, then sorry I\u2019m out!\u201d Give your head a shake, and enjoy the sofa.", "ESH. I understand your frustration. My partner was chronically late while I'm scrupulous about being on time. I feel it's disrespectful to tell someone you're going to be somewhere at a specific time and then leave them waiting. I did once leave my partner at home after making it clear earlier that day that I would do so if they weren't ready on time. You sneaking out was a passive-aggressive move and is guaranteed to make things worse. Having an adult conversation, explaining how important timeliness is to you, will be so much more effective. Good luck and enjoy the couch.", "Seriously? YTA Dude. There are so many other ways that you could have handled this. At the bare minimum you could have said that you were leaving and you would meet her there.\n\nYou wanted to teach your wife a lesson. This came at the cost of spending the game by yourself and being banned from the bedroom. Was it worth it?", "YTA. \n\nI have pretty bad ADHD and one of my worst symptoms is time blindness. No matter how hard I budget for time, I\u2019m always late. I\u2019ve learned to accept that if I have 10 things planned in my day, I need to be able to drop 3-5 of them depending on restraints. \n\nMy husband, is super punctual, almost to a fault. if we have a 45 minute trip to make, he\u2019ll lose his goddamn mind if we don\u2019t leave 90 minutes before we need to be there. That being said- he\u2019s learned to communicate to me when I need to leave. And sometimes that gets on my nerves, and sometimes he struggles to do it nicely, but he communicates because he loves me and he KNOWS I\u2019m not doing it to him intentionally. \n\nAnd at the same time, if I know that I\u2019m not going to be ready when he wants me to be, or that I personally can\u2019t handle being nagged about time that day, then I, as an adult aware of my time blindness, will come to him and say \u201chey, I know you want to leave by 3, but I definitely won\u2019t be ready until 3:30/3:45ish. If you want to drive separate then we can do that, but if you want to wait for me, then I need you to let me get ready without the time coaching today.\u201d \n\nYou didn\u2019t even give your wife the most basic of courtesies when it comes to managing life together. You just left her so that you could \u201cteach her a lesson.\u201d I sincerely hope the lesson she learned was that she\u2019s better off without you.", "YTA\n\nYou went from saying she gets engrossed in the game and loses track of time to calling her a narcissist who does it on purpose.\n\nGrow up. Sneaking out without a word was deliberate and childish.", "YTA. She is not a child or a puppy. You don't teach your spouse a lesson, especially if you want a future. Have you not learnedvtgat once you get married, no fight is actually won if you hurt one another? You lost this war. You hurt someone you love. You also lost a fun shared experience.", "YTA for your abusive, condescending and  resentful behavior towards your wife.\n\nYou behave like an asshole and you speak of her like a complete tool.\n\nGet a divorce already and set her free from this nonsense. You are the one who needs to work on himself.", "YTA\nAs others have mentioned you could have told her you were leaving for her to get a move on, you could have also worked around this yourself by allowing more time (be ready by 5:30 for example). \nYou mention you find it ridiculous that a grown woman can\u2019t budget time. Guess what? Lots of adults find it difficult who have ADHD and/or autism. I have a few friends like this and we make accomodations because they can\u2019t help it, alarms, warnings\u2026 don\u2019t work, it\u2019s just who they are, and yet we still love them and don\u2019t punish them so we can be on some sort of power trip. Maybe you need to grow up and accept the woman you married for who she is, she deserves better. Enjoy the couch, it\u2019s more than you deserve.", "YTA. My first thought is that if this happens regularly that there is perhaps an executive functioning skill thing going on\u2026 your behaviour was utterly despicable.  Purposely teaching her a lesson which really won\u2019t teach her anything if she really does have some difficulties with executive functioning. I feel like you purposely set her up to fail by the way you handled this. You should feel ashamed of yourself. It takes nothing to have at least told her you were going - the leaving without telling her makes this situation 100 times worse and really shows what you think about your wife. You should really have a good look at yourself and figure out how to repair this!", "My brother in Christ have you heard of ADHD?\n\nAnd how this (time blindness) is one of the common symptoms?\n\nAnd how women are frequently under diagnosed?\n\n\n\nI don't know how you don't know how to plan around it already, as her **HUSBAND**. \n\nOne of my best friends runs on what I like to call Taylor Time (fake name but you get the idea) where I add about 15 minutes on to any time we are supposed to be places. Be there at 5 and the drive is typically 30 minutes? I say we need to leave between 4 and 4:15 for traffic just in case. Worst case we are there a bit early but usually we are going out the door by 4:10-4:20 and while they're worried about being late I'm not because I know I built the time blindness in.\n\nIt really seems like you just wanted to be mean for meanness sake.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou may be tired of reminding her, but that is quite literally part of **your** job.  Tell her **ONCE** within a reasonable frame of time that you're leaving at 6pm. NOT 'that morning'. That doesn't really count as a 'reasonable time'. If she's gaming, and you know it's going to take some time to get ready, let her know an hour or so before you have to leave. THAT is reasonable.  NOT 'that morning'.

Not an excuse, mind you, but something you can BOTH learn to live with. \n\nWalking out on time to 'teach her a lesson' is a sure way to tip your relationship into unhealthy territory. It's not helpful in any way to anyone.", "I know that my fiance needs 10 more minutes than I do at minimum, so I'd tell him in your case \"be ready by 5:50\".\n\nDepending on who I'm getting ready with I do the same thing because they never change.\n\nEsh cus I know the frustration but you did this badly lol", "YTA because you didn\u2019t bother to even tell your wife you were leaving like a grown adult", "YTA, you waited until she was in the bathroom *getting ready* to leave without a word, and you have the *gall* to wonder why she's mad.\n\nAs a person with time blindness and an avid gamer, it is *easy* to lose time while gaming, very easy. I have to set timers so I remember to do things like eat, take meds or get ready for work.", "YTA\n\nI'm sure the being late all the time problem has chipped away over time to the point where it's a really sore point. But you lost the moment you took the petty route and left without saying a word. \n\nYou kind of have to open the door and say 'Lady it's 6pm, you coming or not?' At least dude. She's not a mind reader or an alarm clock.", "Literally the definition of an AH move. YTA all the way. She's your wife, not a small child.", ">I saw this as an opportunity to teach her personal responsibility,\n\nYou're her partner, not her father. It's not your place to teach her or punish her. \n\nYTA, you're the one that should apologize.", "\"bUt sHeS a nARciSsIsT\" YTA. You left with zero warning. I can understand being tired of being late and having to remind her of the time, but in this instance you saw a way to punish her for all the times she's lost track of time and you took it and in a big assholey way. Being an adult with a degree and intelligence doesn't reflect in any way on time keeping. Struggling with time management is a symptom of various things like ADHD etc, so you're also the asshole for demeaning her for that too. Being late for shit doesn't make her a bad person. Just telling her she's late all the time won't solve anything, it's not helpful. Instead of just criticizing try coming up with realistic solutions and preventative steps to take to address the issue. If anyone's coming close to a narcissist here, it's you. You owe her an apology, big time.", "As someone with ADHD, and time blindness as a result, YTA\n\nYou're asshole central. Intelligence (something many ADHD people can excel in) doesn't mean you're going to be punctual. I've given my mom many an anxiety attack over time, before I started driving myself to my appointments. Same thing for getting up to catch the bus in highschool \n\nAnd thing is: budgeting time does *not* protect someone from time blindness. I speak from experience. I may have an appointment at 3 at a place that's an hour and a half drive away. I might budget myself a full hour to get ready, with the goal of getting out of the driveway at 1:15, and I garuntee you I won't be out until 1:30 or 1:45 if I was aiming for 1:30\n\nMy particular coping mechanism is to over budget. It hasn't worked for anything other than appointments.\n\nThe fact you immediately jump to narcissism is absolutely *disgusting*. Someone is chronically late due to likely time blindness (I feel your wife on the getting sucked into a game) or maybe even hyperfixation, and you think it makes them the kind of toxic that thinks they can do no wrong?!\n\nWtf is wrong with you, you *can't* ACTUALLY love your wife, nobody who actually loved their wife would do that. Maybe if you'd warned her, or waited another five minutes, I could believe that you did, but as it is? Why the hell did you marry someone you seem so incapable of actually loving and treating like a human \n\nI hope you get the divorce lawyer and settlement that you deserve over this shit. \n\nAnd that the couch is the worst couch in the world to sleep on.", "YTA.\nshe doesn't keep track of her time and that's on her.

Now you're feeling cheeks hurt because she doesn't want you in the bedroom?\nBoth of you need to grow up and become accountable for your actions", "YTA - all you had to do was communicate. \"Dear wife, I am putting on my shoes and leaving in 5 minutes whether you're with me or not is up to you\" but instead of communication you decided to teach your wife a lesson. And now it seems, you're learning an important lesson.", "You chose baseball over a date with your wife who, even with her disorganization, you supposedly love. Not only that, you criticized and shamed her for being herself, the same woman she was when you made your vows and then acted like a total coward in your act of leaving without even saying anything! YTA!", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't sound as if you like your wife. You taught her nothing about time management with this stunt. All you did was show her that you are an AH. She will probably be less likely to acknowledge that she has an issue as you will be the main focus. \n\nI have ADHD and a degree in science and I used to have trouble with time management. I have made a lot of progress and now do fine. I had to try many things before I found a method that worked for me. I have a friend that also has ADHD and they are never on time. Neither my friend nor I have any narcissistic tendencies. Time management is a struggle for some. She can work on it, however, she probably won't now as she is focused on you being an AH. \n\nThere were so many better ways to handle this. You could have told her in the morning you were leaving at 18:00 no matter what. You could have reminded her one hour before leaving. When you are in a relationship you help people with things.", "Info: Did you call through the bathroom door to let her know you were leaving? Was she using the bathroom to get ready or did she need one more minute to finish peeing or something?", "She's n avid gamer? How about a \"Hun, we're leaving in 10 mins.\"?\n\nYTA You sound like you hate this woman. Has she been tested for ADHD? Or other factors that could affect her memory or attentiveness? \n\nYou sound pretty awful here OP.", "YTA.\n\nFair enough if you had told her that you were leaving at 6:00 whether she was ready or not. \n\nBut to just leave without saying so is an AH move.\n\np.s. just out of curiosity,  has she ever been evaluated for ADHD? That kind of time blindness is a classic ADHD symptom.", "I'm going with NTA. Few people realize how EXHAUSTING it is to keep reminding someone to do something that is literally their task to remember; I have ADHD but the desire not to disappoint loved ones trumps time blindness every time. I set alarms, do whatever it takes to be on time. By not even setting an alarm to get ready, the wife is communicating that OP's priorities don't matter, he has to be her daddy and remind her of everything.

We like baseball, but we don't attend many games, so traveling into the city to see games is a rare treat. I know, though, that it would take time to drive there and find parking, due to traffic. Because the game started at 7 PM, and we live about 45 minutes from the stadium, I told her this morning that she needed to be ready to get in the car and go by 6 PM. \n\nWell, my wife is an avid gamer, so she was engrossed in her latest video game when the clock struck 5:45 PM. She has struggled to plan in the past, and I get tired of reminding her that she needs to budget time to get ready. It's as if she has no concept of time at all, similar to a young child. Well, I was ready to go by 6 PM, and she was in the bathroom. I saw this as an opportunity to teach her personal responsibility, so I simply left the house without saying a word, got in the car, and started driving to the game.\n\nIt took my wife a few minutes to figure out what I had done, but when she called me, she was absolutely furious. She said that it was a completely unacceptable move for me to leave without telling her and that she now had no way to get to the game without paying for parking. I told her that I got tired of constantly waiting for her and that she would plan better next time if she didn't want to get left behind. I also reminded her that I had told her that morning when I expected her to be ready to leave. Absolutely none of this seemed to matter, though, and she rudely hung up on me after telling out more insults.\n\nFrankly, I think it's completely insane that a grown woman is unable to budget her time, and I'm starting to suspect that she is doing this on purpose because she's a narcissist who expects me to accommodate her. After all, she's not a dumb woman. She has a science degree. Well, she never showed up to the stadium, and I didn't hear from her the whole game, but when I got home, there was a note on the door. She told me that I wasn't welcome in the bedroom and that I should sleep on the couch. I can't believe she wants to be this much of a pill. If I had waited for her, I would have missed the first pitch. I made my expectations clear, and she couldn't be bothered to meet them. I feel like she should be apologizing to me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But I've had to deal with a compulsively late person before and it wasn't until I started just leaving at the time I said I would, whether they were ready or not, that they finally figured out how to be ready on time.

No, but he doesn't love it. He wishes I could just realize what time it is but I struggle with it so instead this is our compromise so no one is left behind.", "NTA.

Wasting someones time and being constantly late regardless of if it\u2019s a symptom of ADHD is rude and unacceptable and honestly makes that person a massive dick.

If we\u2019re late, we\u2019re late together. And if we end up being late repeatedly, then we would have a conversation about how to support each other in getting out the door faster. And this is for work in the morning, where there are actual consequences of being late. You were going to a baseball game. Being there for the first pitch is not life or death - there would have been no tangible consequences if you had been a few minutes late to the game.

There are reasons why even an educated adult might struggle with timeliness. It happens when someone with one of these conditions becomes hyperfocused on a task or activity, like work or even video games. Again, it\u2019s super common. I personally have time blindness where I will get in the groove of something and completely lose track of all concept of passing time.

ADHD makes that perception difficult, either by not subconsciously tracking it due to other sensory disruptions (a noise, socks, anything itchy) or because during hyperfocus that sensory input is ignored for other input.

Hell, a lot of modern performances themselves don't even start at a specified time anymore, as much as there simply being a doors-open time. You wouldn't be able to survive the chaos of a modern drag show, so maybe dial down the judgement your about your locked door events with rooms so quiet you can hear everyone else's farts.", "Yeah I agree that she needs to be ready but it wasn't very smart of OP for his relationship to leave without saying anything. Because now it's easier for his wife to shift blame to him instead of herself.\n\nThey're giving her too much of a pass and it's frustrating. I'm late to things but if I miss out, it's my own damn fault and no one else should have to miss out or wait for me.", "Yeah absolutely agree with you. When something is important enough, we take all precautions to get there on time. \n\nHis wife clearly didn't put the same level of importance on the game as he did.", "Another thing I read about the bruises and bumping into stuff was to do with the natural postural sway - [found the link!](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness/postural-sway-adhd) - basically all bodies have a natural postural sway that keeps them upright and balanced, but that\u2019s missing in neurodivergent people hence we bump into stuff. My husband likes to joke every time I walk into a kitchen counter or a door frame \u2018yes, this hasn\u2019t been there before\u2019.", "*So* many people fail to see the difference between an explanation and an excuse. My saying that I fucked up because of bipolar bullshit is not me trying to shift blame. It's me trying to give a reason that isn't \"I'm lazy/incompetent/a prick\". I already catch enough shame from myself for this shit."]}
