But then he went to the kitchen and I heard fridge doors and cabinets slamming. He came back out to the dinning room and was pissed. He asked why there wasn't any meat besides frozen chicken we've had for a few weeks now. I told him how I didn't want to buy or cook meat anymore since it was no longer part of my diet. \n\nHe lashed out and accused me of trying to force vegetarianism on him. I told him he was free to buy his own meat and cook it himself. I just didn't want to do it anymore. He kept saying I was being a typical vegan, forcing my beliefs on others. \n\nAfter he said that, I snapped. I shouted about how he never even buys groceries, it's always out of my money. I basically called him out on how I keep the kitchen stocked and he never even offers to pay even a portion of it. \n\nMy bf stormed off and I didn't see him again until the next morning.

He's just been spoiled thus far.", "I think this is closer to the line than a lot of people here are giving it credit for as a lot of people do, in fact, do what the family is saying, and I assume that's how the bf is spinning it.  \n\n\nHOWEVER (before I get beat up)  \n\n\nHe's having you pay groceries 100% when everything else is split.

There won't be many shared meals but... it is what it is.", "info: do you have an arrangement in which he pays other expenses and you are responsible for groceries? If the groceries are your share of expenses it is a little unfair to make an essentially unilateral decision on what will be purchased. \n\nIf you're buying all the groceries because he doesn't feel like spending the time or money to do so and still expects you to cater to what he wants I think you have bigger problems than buying meat or not.", "NTA. He's a grown man. If he isn't happy with what you buy and cook, then he's free to shop and cook for himself. Not knowing how to cook is a poor excuse. The internet is full of simple and tasty recipes.", "Nta.   He's an entitled child throwing a whiney tantrum. Don't reward him for that.  \n\nYes, it's easy to just cook a piece of meat. Heat a pan. Season steak with salt and pepper.  Sear for 3-4 minuts on each side. Done. Easy enough that he can simply do it on his own right next to you.", "NTA - Because he gives you no money on groceries which is just crazy. Yes he should definitely buy his own meat if he wants to eat it. But also you need to have him chipping in on groceries.", "NTA, It'd only be forcing your beliefs on him if you stopped him from cooking for himself. Sounds like a child who's mad that he's responsible for washing his own clothes. The fact that you're in charge of paying and cooking with no input from him means that whatever you buy is up to you. He doesn't like it, he can start contributing himself.\n\nPS, you might like the cookbook series \"Eat like you give a fuck\", lots of flavorful dishes to choose from there.\n\nAnd some favorite replacements as a meat eater:Just Egg frozen patties - better than the weird eggs on mcdonalds breakfast sandwiches, super fast breakfast sandwiches in the morningMorningstar bacon - for crispy smokey flavor on your sandwichesGardein's chicken patties in the black bag - I use these for everything. Salad? gonna get a patty. Japanese katsu curry? Going to get a patty. Chicken parm? going to get a patty topped in cheese and tomato sauce.\n\nAvoid beyond sausages in the link shape like the plague, they smell horrible cooked. Impossible sausage or beyond sausage at dunkin and starbucks have been the only thing I order from either for a couple years now.", "NTA, but you really should have made it clear before he sat down to eat that you would not be stocking meat at all. His reaction makes him 100% TA here, but surprising him with it was still a sign of poor communication. He'd be right to be a little irritated about that, but he wasn't a little irritated, he was a giant baby.", "NTA. And please dump his ass.", "NTA it's silly that he except you to buy and cook meat you have no intention of eating since he has basically been eating food you are cooking for yourself and have been willing to share.", "My wife is a vegetarian and I\u2019m not. I only eat meat if it\u2019s takeout we\u2019re ordering or for my work lunches, and I do all the menu planning and shopping and cooking - I just cook vegetarian dishes. Find someone who respects you.", "ESH for the overall lack of communication on how your new diet would impact the household. You just decided by yourself that you're not cooking meat anymore without discussing it at all. He overreacted to one meal.", "I cook for my girlfriend who is vegan. I typically cook my meat separate and add it to my dish separately. He could consider doing that. \n\nOnly thing I\u2019ll say is you could have given him a heads up that you wouldn\u2019t COOK meat for him in addition to not cooking it for yourself as he may have assumed you\u2019d have no problems cooking it for him. \n\nIn any case, NTA, just work out a plan with him and he\u2019ll likely need to start contributing, which it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s been doing.", "You kind of sprung it on him. If you were going to change his diet as well as your own you should have given him fair warning that he would be responsible for his own meat based meals.", "ESH. If you had an already established arrangement of cooking meals you both like, then yes YATA for suddenly switching to meatless without even telling him. He should have had a heads up so that he ample time to get a meat option, as many people do not feel full or nutritionally complete without a meat protein. HOWEVER he is also TA for throwing a fit like a child. He's an adult, and should behave like one. Everyone sucks here", "ESH. Learn how to communicate.", "NTA  \nBut if you are going shopping then you could buy the stuff he wants too. I mean...its efficient that way. Its basic stuff that you buy things for your partner too. The main problem here is that you are the only one who buys/cooks. You should both put effort into these. For example if he goes grocery shopping he should think about vegan options for you too. Communication is the key here.", "ESH\n\n> If I'm not going to be eating it, I don't want to buy or cook it.\n\nBoth of you should have sat down and talked about what this meant going forward, instead you made a decision for both of you and he flew off the handle rather quickly.", "ESH. \n\n> I told him how I didn't want to buy or cook meat anymore since it was no longer part of my diet.\n\nPerfectly reasonable, but you should have told him that when you decided it. IDK how it got to the point where he was surprised there was no meat in the house, did the two of you never have a conversation about it?", "YTA\n\nI do not know how you to split up roles and finances so assuming that is not part of the issue you are creating more work for you two.\n\nNow he has to also go grocery shopping also. You want two different meals to be cooked.  You will eat together less often.\n\nHe is having a big baby tantrum over you passive aggressive plan.  Think about what your goal in the relationship is.", "YTA. \n\nThe two of you have shared and differentiated responsibilities in the house which had a prior understanding that there would be meat available. You changed that by surprise and arbitrarily determined you would no longer be shopping for meat.\n\nChange this to diet coke - if you were doing the grocery shopping for the house and bought diet coke every week, it would be an asshole thing to suddenly refuse to shop for diet coke because you aren't drinking it anymore.\n\nOf course he shouldn't be \"lashing out at you\" but I refuse to judge based upon all of the dressing added on top of the real issue.", "YTA, for not communicating this up front. You created this problem because you chose not to tell him that you were changing the longstanding dynamic of shopping and cooking meat. You knew he wasn't going vegetarian, you had chicken on hand, but you still served him a meal based on YOUR new diet, and acted surprised when he didn't like it?  A simple conversation before hand would have given you both a chance to figure out how to manage the 'new' shopping/cooking situation. What you did instead was very passive-aggressive, and designed to create this exact conflict.", "So my parents, two of the most wonderful people on this planet, one is a vegan, one isn\u2019t. They manage and they cope. When mum cooks, it\u2019s vegan and she will cook meat separately for him. When dad cooks, it\u2019s vegan but he\u2019ll cook some meat separately. \n\nTo an extent, I\u2019d say YTA. \n\nSaying this, you BF should be paying their way and contributing to household tasks equally. The fact he\u2019s a grown man and doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s concerning. \n\nSo, to this extent, I\u2019d say NTA. \n\nWhat seems to be an issue here is communication, expectation and respect. Try and have a calm and sensible conversation where instead of things like \u2018typical vegan\u2019 are said, \u201cthis is how I feel about the situation..\u201d is said and a compromise reached. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, me and my husband haven\u2019t had a row in over a decade of being together, because we learnt from past relationships and started ours off on the basis of communication and mutual respect in all things.", "ESH. Weird. Yet another thread where the parties don't communicate and it blows up in their faces...\n\nYTA for not communicating your plans. He's the AH for complaining, pouting, and not just getting his own groceries. Now would the reaction have been different if you let him know ahead of time so he has a chance to get his own groceries?

That just fell on me because I will always cook meals for myself, and there will always be enough for him to have some. I was also raised not to eat in front of others without offering some, so maybe that's why I feel the need to feed him. \nHe on the other hand will sit there in front of me and eat something he made just for himself without even asking if I'm hungry", "That has been answered here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r3pby/aita_for_refusing_to_buycook_meat_for_my_bf/j6th4up?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "I told him I wasn't going to eat meat anymore. The meals I cook are normally for myself, but he gets to eat too because I make enough to feed us both. As I mentioned in my post, I don't mind cooking because I didn't have to change portion sizes or anything because I always make a lot.", "When your meal strategy appears to be \"eat whatever my girlfriend cooks\", her saying that she's going to stop having meat *is* fair warning.", "Have to agree here.  ESH - the lack of communication is the issue here.  While you told him of your decision, you didn't mention what that meant for him.  You're in a relationship, it's a two-way street, you need to respect and show that you care for each other.  You failed to do that here by not telling him that you were no longer buying/preparing meat.  Not communicating that was pretty disrespectful and he could see that as you don't care about him.\n\nOn the other side, he sucks, because he has been letting you do everything and not stepping up and helping out at least, then running off and telling your family.", "The \"established arrangement\" was I cook food, the same stuff I normally cook for myself, and he eats whatever it is because I always make a lot (I grew up cooking for a big family and have a hard time making single serving portions.)\nI'm not the designated cook, I just feed him because I have the means too. He, on the other hand, spends his money on weed and snacks. When he does actually make a meal he doesn't offer me any. It's usually I see food left out on the stove and I'll eat some because he normally just leaves stuff out to go  to waste. If he does give me food it's usually because he bought fast food and didn't want to sneak and eat it so he got some for me.", "The post says she told him beforehand and he was seemingly supportive of her decision. She did give him a \u201cheads up\u201d.", "If he provided the money to do so, I wouldn't mind picking up some meat when I shop. \nThe issue is he never buys groceries. He won't even go to the store with me and help me bring groceries in. \nI'm not going to buy something I'm not going to eat.", "We split all of our finances equally except for grocery bills. That falls solely on me. When I cook, I cook because I want to eat and I make what I want. Because I make large portions, and I like to feed people, he gets to eat too. \nIt's not something that was ever agreed upon. I just went about how I normally take care of myself with food and groceries, and he benefitted from it.", "I'm not complaining about doing the grocery shopping and cooking. As I've mentioned in other comments, I'm going to buy and cook the same food and portions anyway, so we both win. The issue here is I've always made the foods I like and want to cook. Nothing has changed from when I lived on my own. My bf benefits from the fact that I like a fully stocked kitchen and I was raised in a big family where portion sizes were huge, so I have a hard time making smaller portions. I've never once had to tell him what I was making or ask him if he was okay with something. He's getting free meals. The only thing I'll do for him that's \"special\" is set aside his portion before adding an ingredient he doesn't like to the rest of the food. \nIf he wants to eat something I no longer buy or cook for myself, he's welcome to buy and cook it himself and add it to his portion of whatever I make.", "Why does she need to buy his food and cook for him to be in a relationship with him? /gen", "Yup, \"I guEss I'll just StarVe to Death TheN\"", "NTA then. He should be contributing to the food expenses especially since he's not cooking.", "First off, NTA.\n\nThat being said, why haven't you discussed splitting the financial responsibility for groceries? \n\nA healthy relationship would address that issue first. Next, once he's on board with splitting things fairly maybe then you would feel more open about grabbing him some meat when it's necessary. Meat that obviously he will need to pay for since its for him. Simple concept overall and I see no reason why he should object to any of that. If he does, then... you know what to do.\n\nGood luck with your new diet!", "She's the only one buying groceries and cooking. If all mealplanning was solely in my responsibility and my partner didn't help pay for food, I don't think my default thought would be \"I should go out of my way to pay and continue to do this for him\" if I've always viewed it as he's just tagging along with whatever I'm eating since he's never put into it before.", "Really?  If my SO went veggie, I would just assume they wouldn't be buying or cooking me meat.  Everyone's different I guess.", "That probably would not have helped much. He would still be angry, demand to know why she isn't buying and cooking meat and ran to her brother for support.", "Gotta be honest with you, between the original post and additional comments like this I don't see what you see in him.", ">The meals I cook are normally for myself, but he gets to eat too\n\nTbh this sounds like the meals you make were for both of you and you are doing some mental gymnastics to say you only cook for yourself when he ate every meal.", "You guys overall lack communication.  You seem to be saying u just fell into cooking bc u don't mind. Those things need to be discussed btw couples, this is what happens when u just fall into doing these chores.  Discuss who pays and shops for groceries and cooks.  By not discussing it this is the situation that happens.  \n\nHe shldnt just expect you to do all this work, but u shldnt keep doing these things and then become resentful bc hes not helping (if u don't talk about it).  You have to talk with each other and decide who does what. \n\nIt's perfectly fine to want to only cook and buy vegetarian.  You cant just spring that on ur bf with no conversation, even if the separation of chores is unfair and you just do this bc u don't mind, it was still the routine.  A routine you both let become established through complicity and not talking.  \n\nHe shld not have responded that way and as a grown up shld be cooking and shopping.  You two need to sit down and talk and set up a schedule.  And honestly, you need to be thinking if this is the person you want to build a life with.  Does he even appreciate or realize all the work you put into cooking and shopping for him?  Is his over the top childish reaction really what you want to be dealing with 20 years down the road?\n\nESH", "The relationship is doomed if you are fighting over food.  \n\nIt's totally understandable that you don't want to handle meat but you should have given him a heads up that you were going to deviate from your normal shopping list.\n\nI can't imagine a fun relationship where you two have to cook separate meals all the time without arguing.", "YES.  Not to mention, he doesn't *die* if he doesn't get meat for one meal.  There's no need to bang around the kitchen like a vampire looking for blood. It's one veggie meal.", "Implying things is not the same as saying them directly", "Gonna be honest here, between this and the other comments you've provided, it sounds a lot like roommates who happen to sleep together.  Are you sure about this relationship?", "She told him she was done eating meat, not that she was done preparing it in the home. She even states how she bought everything normal except meat, and he was obviously surprised by a meatless meal. That is not a heads up.", "That's not the same thing, what I'm taking from that is she told him she was no longer going to eat meat, not that she would stop cooking it or buying it all together.", "Right, this is what i meant (sorry, english is not my first language)   \nSo the main problem is not whether you buy meat or not. The problem is that he \"keeps you like a housemaid\". You should split the chores and housework up, like: you get the groceries this week, next week he does it. What to buy is basicly a grocery list...its trivial problem.  \nBut you are NTA here :)", "Which is why you and he had a routine that he was used to. You should have talked to him to let him know your intentions.\n\nWhile what you fixed sounds good, I think it would sound much better with some meat so I understand your BF's surprise to the shake up in routine which could have been avoided with communication.", "I've always felt that because I'm not changing what I make and how much of it I make since going from living alone to living with him, I don't need to ask him to help buy things that I'm going to get regardless of whether he helps or not. \nI guess that was a mistake, as now he just expects me to do it.", "Again, it\u2019s just assuming vs communication, there\u2019s nothing technically wrong with what she did and she\u2019s 100% in her right to not do that, I just think I would have communicated that it was going to change and he was responsible instead of him finding out that night", "That\u2019s completely true, everyone is different it\u2019s just communication,  a simple sentence could have prevented it, on the other side he could have gotten mad then, then she would know he\u2019s not worth being with. In my eyes it\u2019s just better to communicate than assume, but some people don\u2019t have to, they just know", "I did cover that though, the thing is he probably would have been either way, but that would take the surprise element out. Again either way, the dude is a dick. But we don\u2019t know for sure because it didn\u2019t happen like that. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s an ass lol, it\u2019s just strange to me to not say it beforehand, but again different relationships different ways I guess.", "I'm not saying they aren't for both of us. I'm saying I cook the food I want to make for myself, and he gets to eat too because I always make enough to feed multiple people. Of course at this point I was making food for the both of us, but the things I buy and cook haven't changed since living alone and only cooking for myself. \nFor instance, he doesn't like mushrooms. So, when making things like pasta, I remove his portion before adding the mushrooms to the rest of it. I'm still going to make what I make for myself, but I do try to make sure I can still feed him too.", "The established routine was she bought what she was going to cook.", "Seems like plenty of a \u201cheads up\u201d to me. \n\nSo her bf just assumed she\u2019d be making 2 meals? A meatless one for her and a meat one for him? \n\nI agree that a little more communication could have helped this situation. But why does that all fall on OP? Her bf could have communicated as well. Her bf also could have put a little bit of thought into her change in diet and not assumed she\u2019d continue to be his personal chef. If he\u2019s going through life relying on his gf to cook and buy all of his food then I don\u2019t think he has any room to complain about what she makes.", "If she has been cooking for herself and he eats because there is always plenty, why would she cook meat that she isn't going to eat?", "If you didn't change the amount of food you made...but you are now 2 people living off of it...do you both eat less or did you throw out leftovers before? This doesn't add up.\n\nAlso, him not even offering to pay half is very cheap of him. The demands now are completely out of line and out of touch. Any family that is supporting this should be informed that you are so thankful for them understanding your boyfriends need for meat and happy they will provide on their own dime and time in the future.\n\nNTA", "Exactly", "It doesn't \"all fall\" on the op, that's why I said ESH. She should have made it more clear she would no longer be preparing meat options, a simple text saying \"I'm not cooking meat for either of us anymore, be prepared for that\" would have been more than sufficient. And he needs become a better partner, flipping out the way OP described isn't appropriate either, and he should be cooking more meals if that's still a point of contention in the relationship. OP claims she simply  cooks enough food of a meal she wants,and the bf eats what she makes. but in his mind she's been cooking for both of them. Bad communication on all fronts", "For one they're in a relationship, sometimes you just do things for your partner.\n\nHowever if we agreed that she didn't have to cook it, stopping buying it at all is a AH thing without a discussion. \n\nIf I was giving up chocolate, I wouldn't just stop buying my partner's favourite chocolate.", "I grew up in a household of 7 people, and although I don't make nearly as much food as I did when living with them, I still make quite a bit. Because of this, I always have plenty of leftovers. Unfortunately, that, combined with being raised to always clear my plate and not waste food, caused a lot of overeating. Having my bf eat what I make helps cut down on the amount of leftovers which in turn keeps me from sitting in front of the TV at 2am eating a whole pot of leftover MacNCheese...\nThat is how I'm able to make the same amounts of food without it making too much of a difference for me (besides the fact that it helps keep me from binge eating.)", "Doesn\u2019t seem even close to E S H, imo. The bf is way worse in this situation. He made assumptions, he failed to communicate, he threw a tantrum when he realized she didn\u2019t buy meat, and he doesn\u2019t even buy his own food. Maybeee OP could have communicated a little more clearly, but her bf could have easily put 2 and 2 together and realized she wouldn\u2019t be making meat. OP is definitely NTA here and she\u2019s not responsible for the assumptions he made in his head.", "And not even close to NTA, imo. The bf definitely responded inappropriately, 100%. And she's not responsible for his assumptions, also 100% agree. But he's not responsible for hers either then. And her assumption was that he would understand she wouldn't be cooking meat, without saying it, or assumed he would just eat it without a problem, without telling him. He assumed she would keep cooking meat for him and be simply add a vegan protein to the meal for herself, without asking, and then threw a tantrum when he was surprised. Bad communication and expectations from both. ESH. The degree of S for each party individually is definitely debatable, bf probably more S than the OP, but ESH still, if it's on the binary scale of S or no S"]}
