{"id": 8881, "submission_id": "10r3pby", "title": "AITA for refusing to buy/cook meat for my bf?", "selftext": "I (f24) have been grocery shopping and cooking for my bf (m27) and me for the past year or so. Bf will cook a meal or to every once in awhile, but it's usually me, which I don't mind because I love to cook and haven't really had to change the amount of food I used to make when I was alone. \n\nRecently, I made the choice to remove meat from my diet. There are many reasons why, but the main one is it has just been making me feel sick lately. When I told my bf about my decision he seemed really supportive and just wanted me to do what was best for me. \n\nOver the weekend I bought all of the usual things plus a few new meatless options. The only thing I left off my shopping list was meat. If I'm not going to be eating it, I don't want to buy or cook it. When my bf came home to find a meat-free dinner (veggie fried rice, potato pot stickers, and grilled veggie kabobs,) he was visibly irritated. When I asked him what was wrong he said it was nothing. But then he went to the kitchen and I heard fridge doors and cabinets slamming. He came back out to the dinning room and was pissed. He asked why there wasn't any meat besides frozen chicken we've had for a few weeks now. I told him how I didn't want to buy or cook meat anymore since it was no longer part of my diet. \n\nHe lashed out and accused me of trying to force vegetarianism on him. I told him he was free to buy his own meat and cook it himself. I just didn't want to do it anymore. He kept saying I was being a typical vegan, forcing my beliefs on others. \n\nAfter he said that, I snapped. I shouted about how he never even buys groceries, it's always out of my money. I basically called him out on how I keep the kitchen stocked and he never even offers to pay even a portion of it. \n\nMy bf stormed off and I didn't see him again until the next morning. Apparently he had gone to my brother's house (they're close) and complained about me. My brother told the rest of my family and now they're all saying I'm being a controlling bitch for not cooking meat for him. They believe it's not hard to just make us the same meals and just add meat to his. I keep telling everyone that I shouldn't have to do that for him, but according to everyone else I'm the AH here.\n\nEdit: I don't shop for the household. I shop for the things I want. My bf is just welcome to help himself. I don't like frozen pizzas or Rap Snacks but my bf does, so he buys those things for himself. \nWe're not some movie couple who sits down to a meal together every night. It's more like I leave a pot of food on the stove and let him know it's there after making my plate.\n\nEdit: just so it's clear, we split all other household expenses down the middle. The only expense that's not shared is food. I buy groceries to cook for myself, and he buys junk food and frozen dinners for himself. I share my food because I can, but if I make something he doesn't like he doesn't have to eat it and can have one of his frozen dinners. \n\nUpdate: The more of these replies I respond to, the more I'm starting to realize that my bf might have an issue with vegans or something. I've made plenty of meatless meals in the past without complaint. It wasn't until I told him that I was removing meat from my diet that he complained about the food I made and searched the kitchen to see what I bought. I feel like he was just wanting for his moment to lash out about vegetarianism/veganism", "created_utc": 1675279954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r3pby/aita_for_refusing_to_buycook_meat_for_my_bf/", "score": 1067, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's just been spoiled thus far.", "I think this is closer to the line than a lot of people here are giving it credit for as a lot of people do, in fact, do what the family is saying, and I assume that's how the bf is spinning it.  \n\n\nHOWEVER (before I get beat up)  \n\n\nHe's having you pay groceries 100% when everything else is split.

There won't be many shared meals but... it is what it is.", "info: do you have an arrangement in which he pays other expenses and you are responsible for groceries? If the groceries are your share of expenses it is a little unfair to make an essentially unilateral decision on what will be purchased. \n\nIf you're buying all the groceries because he doesn't feel like spending the time or money to do so and still expects you to cater to what he wants I think you have bigger problems than buying meat or not.", "NTA. He's a grown man. If he isn't happy with what you buy and cook, then he's free to shop and cook for himself. Not knowing how to cook is a poor excuse. The internet is full of simple and tasty recipes.", "Nta.   He's an entitled child throwing a whiney tantrum. Don't reward him for that.  \n\nYes, it's easy to just cook a piece of meat. Heat a pan. Season steak with salt and pepper.  Sear for 3-4 minuts on each side. Done. Easy enough that he can simply do it on his own right next to you.", "NTA - Because he gives you no money on groceries which is just crazy. Yes he should definitely buy his own meat if he wants to eat it. But also you need to have him chipping in on groceries.", "NTA, It'd only be forcing your beliefs on him if you stopped him from cooking for himself. Sounds like a child who's mad that he's responsible for washing his own clothes. The fact that you're in charge of paying and cooking with no input from him means that whatever you buy is up to you. He doesn't like it, he can start contributing himself.\n\nPS, you might like the cookbook series \"Eat like you give a fuck\", lots of flavorful dishes to choose from there.\n\nAnd some favorite replacements as a meat eater:  \nJust Egg frozen patties - better than the weird eggs on mcdonalds breakfast sandwiches, super fast breakfast sandwiches in the morning  \nMorningstar bacon - for crispy smokey flavor on your sandwiches  \nGardein's chicken patties in the black bag - I use these for everything. Salad? gonna get a patty. Japanese katsu curry? Going to get a patty. Chicken parm? going to get a patty topped in cheese and tomato sauce.\n\nAvoid beyond sausages in the link shape like the plague, they smell horrible cooked. Impossible sausage or beyond sausage at dunkin and starbucks have been the only thing I order from either for a couple years now.", "NTA, but you really should have made it clear before he sat down to eat that you would not be stocking meat at all. His reaction makes him 100% TA here, but surprising him with it was still a sign of poor communication. He'd be right to be a little irritated about that, but he wasn't a little irritated, he was a giant baby.", "NTA. And please dump his ass.", "NTA it's silly that he except you to buy and cook meat you have no intention of eating since he has basically been eating food you are cooking for yourself and have been willing to share.", "My wife is a vegetarian and I\u2019m not. I only eat meat if it\u2019s takeout we\u2019re ordering or for my work lunches, and I do all the menu planning and shopping and cooking - I just cook vegetarian dishes. Find someone who respects you.", "ESH for the overall lack of communication on how your new diet would impact the household. You just decided by yourself that you're not cooking meat anymore without discussing it at all. He overreacted to one meal.", "I cook for my girlfriend who is vegan. I typically cook my meat separate and add it to my dish separately. He could consider doing that. \n\nOnly thing I\u2019ll say is you could have given him a heads up that you wouldn\u2019t COOK meat for him in addition to not cooking it for yourself as he may have assumed you\u2019d have no problems cooking it for him. \n\nIn any case, NTA, just work out a plan with him and he\u2019ll likely need to start contributing, which it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s been doing.", "You kind of sprung it on him. If you were going to change his diet as well as your own you should have given him fair warning that he would be responsible for his own meat based meals.", "ESH. If you had an already established arrangement of cooking meals you both like, then yes YATA for suddenly switching to meatless without even telling him. He should have had a heads up so that he ample time to get a meat option, as many people do not feel full or nutritionally complete without a meat protein. HOWEVER he is also TA for throwing a fit like a child. He's an adult, and should behave like one. Everyone sucks here", "ESH. Learn how to communicate.", "NTA  \nBut if you are going shopping then you could buy the stuff he wants too. I mean...its efficient that way. Its basic stuff that you buy things for your partner too. The main problem here is that you are the only one who buys/cooks. You should both put effort into these. For example if he goes grocery shopping he should think about vegan options for you too. Communication is the key here.", "ESH\n\n> If I'm not going to be eating it, I don't want to buy or cook it.\n\nBoth of you should have sat down and talked about what this meant going forward, instead you made a decision for both of you and he flew off the handle rather quickly.", "ESH. \n\n> I told him how I didn't want to buy or cook meat anymore since it was no longer part of my diet.\n\nPerfectly reasonable, but you should have told him that when you decided it. IDK how it got to the point where he was surprised there was no meat in the house, did the two of you never have a conversation about it?", "YTA\n\nI do not know how you to split up roles and finances so assuming that is not part of the issue you are creating more work for you two.\n\nNow he has to also go grocery shopping also. You want two different meals to be cooked.  You will eat together less often.\n\nHe is having a big baby tantrum over you passive aggressive plan.  Think about what your goal in the relationship is.", "YTA. \n\nThe two of you have shared and differentiated responsibilities in the house which had a prior understanding that there would be meat available. You changed that by surprise and arbitrarily determined you would no longer be shopping for meat.\n\nChange this to diet coke - if you were doing the grocery shopping for the house and bought diet coke every week, it would be an asshole thing to suddenly refuse to shop for diet coke because you aren't drinking it anymore.\n\nOf course he shouldn't be \"lashing out at you\" but I refuse to judge based upon all of the dressing added on top of the real issue.", "YTA, for not communicating this up front. You created this problem because you chose not to tell him that you were changing the longstanding dynamic of shopping and cooking meat. You knew he wasn't going vegetarian, you had chicken on hand, but you still served him a meal based on YOUR new diet, and acted surprised when he didn't like it?  A simple conversation before hand would have given you both a chance to figure out how to manage the 'new' shopping/cooking situation. What you did instead was very passive-aggressive, and designed to create this exact conflict.", "So my parents, two of the most wonderful people on this planet, one is a vegan, one isn\u2019t. They manage and they cope. When mum cooks, it\u2019s vegan and she will cook meat separately for him. When dad cooks, it\u2019s vegan but he\u2019ll cook some meat separately. \n\nTo an extent, I\u2019d say YTA. \n\nSaying this, you BF should be paying their way and contributing to household tasks equally. The fact he\u2019s a grown man and doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s concerning. \n\nSo, to this extent, I\u2019d say NTA. \n\nWhat seems to be an issue here is communication, expectation and respect. Try and have a calm and sensible conversation where instead of things like \u2018typical vegan\u2019 are said, \u201cthis is how I feel about the situation..\u201d is said and a compromise reached. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, me and my husband haven\u2019t had a row in over a decade of being together, because we learnt from past relationships and started ours off on the basis of communication and mutual respect in all things.", "ESH. Weird. Yet another thread where the parties don't communicate and it blows up in their faces...\n\nYTA for not communicating your plans. He's the AH for complaining, pouting, and not just getting his own groceries. Now would the reaction have been different if you let him know ahead of time so he has a chance to get his own groceries?

Having said that (and ignoring the issue of who pays for groceries because that to me is a separate issue) it might have been a better move, relationship-wise, to approach this change to your mealtime ritual in a more gradual manner. I went pescatarian a little over 3 years ago. Just woke up one day and decided no more meat. My husband did not join me in this, nor did I expect him to do so. But I hoped he would get on board eventually. While I can\u2019t say I Love cooking as you do, most days I like to cook and I am good at it. So my husband has always said. When I first made the change, I began by cooking meat for him and seafood or a plant-based protein for me, with sides we both like. Was it more work? Sure. But a week or so into the big shift, we made an agreement that as long as I didn\u2019t try to slip jackfruit into his tacos when he wasn\u2019t looking, he would try a bite of my protein option at each meal. Over time, and after experimenting with different seafood recipes and various plant-based alternatives, I figured out which meatless options he likes, which he\u2019ll tolerate, and which he just can\u2019t stomach. And now he is off pork altogether (even bacon!) and only eats red meat in tacos. He still likes chicken from time to time (though only in strips or chopped as he says a full breast or even a cutlet is too much flesh and grosses him out which gives me hope). So now I rarely cook us separate proteins, we\u2019re both eating healthier, and the transition was relatively painless. In three years, we\u2019ve only had one argument about it.
