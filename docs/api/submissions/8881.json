Bf will cook a meal or to every once in awhile, but it's usually me, which I don't mind because I love to cook and haven't really had to change the amount of food I used to make when I was alone. \n\nRecently, I made the choice to remove meat from my diet. There are many reasons why, but the main one is it has just been making me feel sick lately. When I told my bf about my decision he seemed really supportive and just wanted me to do what was best for me. \n\nOver the weekend I bought all of the usual things plus a few new meatless options. The only thing I left off my shopping list was meat. If I'm not going to be eating it, I don't want to buy or cook it. When my bf came home to find a meat-free dinner (veggie fried rice, potato pot stickers, and grilled veggie kabobs,) he was visibly irritated. When I asked him what was wrong he said it was nothing. But then he went to the kitchen and I heard fridge doors and cabinets slamming. He came back out to the dinning room and was pissed. He asked why there wasn't any meat besides frozen chicken we've had for a few weeks now. I told him how I didn't want to buy or cook meat anymore since it was no longer part of my diet. \n\nHe lashed out and accused me of trying to force vegetarianism on him. I told him he was free to buy his own meat and cook it himself. I just didn't want to do it anymore. He kept saying I was being a typical vegan, forcing my beliefs on others. \n\nAfter he said that, I snapped. I shouted about how he never even buys groceries, it's always out of my money. I basically called him out on how I keep the kitchen stocked and he never even offers to pay even a portion of it. \n\nMy bf stormed off and I didn't see him again until the next morning. Apparently he had gone to my brother's house (they're close) and complained about me. My brother told the rest of my family and now they're all saying I'm being a controlling bitch for not cooking meat for him. They believe it's not hard to just make us the same meals and just add meat to his. I keep telling everyone that I shouldn't have to do that for him, but according to everyone else I'm the AH here.\n\nEdit: I don't shop for the household. I shop for the things I want. My bf is just welcome to help himself. I don't like frozen pizzas or Rap Snacks but my bf does, so he buys those things for himself. \nWe're not some movie couple who sits down to a meal together every night.

Was he told before the trip you were not going to buy any as well as cooking it?", "Well, I'm going with NTA for now.\n\nBut it depends on the relationship dynamics. Do you roughly split chores and two of yours happen to be cooking and shopping? Was any split the subject of discussion? Or do you do the lion's share and he just kinda mooches on the chore work?\n\nIf it's the former, it would rather feel to him like forcing your eating habits on him, because it'd be basically saying \"yes this is part of my agreed-upon chores, but I'm only going to do it the way I want\" after being and living together for however long.\n\nBut it does kinda sound like the latter when you say something like \"I shouted about how he never even buys groceries\", which is not something you'd shout if it was part of a fully voluntary agreement.\n\n(Still....I wonder: is there even going to be *space* for him to cook himself meals with meat the same time you are cooking yourself a vegetarian meal? For this to work, you will have to either be fine with not having meals together or find a way to give him space to prepare meat while you're doing the rest).", "NTA he was lucky you paid for it as long as you did.

Since he isn\u2019t doing any of that, he can buy and cook his own food.\n\nAlso, he immediately runs off to OP\u2019s family and manipulates the narrative to get them all on his side.\n\nBUT, maybe OP should have informed him that she wasn\u2019t going to buy anymore meat options.

I'm a meatlover, but he's not buying or cooking, and you shouldn't have to make 2 separate meals. So he can start cooking for himself or eat what you make. However, if you know he loves meat, you should have given him a heads up that there wouldn't be meat that night or any night going forward.", "NTA.

I think your bf is a spoiled baby.", "You're in the right.

He is free to buy and cook the meat on his own. The grocery store and the kitchen is not under a lock and key.", "NTA. You're doing literally nothing to stop him from buying and cooking his own meat if he wants it.\n\nIf he's not paying for the groceries, then he's got no ground to stand on here.", "Why is it still a problem that men confuse girlfriend/wife with \u201cpersonal chef\u201d?

If you aren\u2019t going to dump him, you should stop cooking for him and shopping for groceries for him altogether.", "NTA...Strange how his supportive tone ends suddenly when he wants to eat meat.  The meal you cooked sounds fantastic.  I think buying and cooking his own meat is completely reasonable.  He's just been spoiled thus far.", "I think this is closer to the line than a lot of people here are giving it credit for as a lot of people do, in fact, do what the family is saying, and I assume that's how the bf is spinning it.  \n\n\nHOWEVER (before I get beat up)  \n\n\nHe's having you pay groceries 100% when everything else is split. That makes this situation 100% NTA. The solution is obvious; split the groceries and he handles his dinner. There won't be many shared meals but... it is what it is.", "info: do you have an arrangement in which he pays other expenses and you are responsible for groceries? If the groceries are your share of expenses it is a little unfair to make an essentially unilateral decision on what will be purchased. \n\nIf you're buying all the groceries because he doesn't feel like spending the time or money to do so and still expects you to cater to what he wants I think you have bigger problems than buying meat or not.", "NTA. He's a grown man. If he isn't happy with what you buy and cook, then he's free to shop and cook for himself. Not knowing how to cook is a poor excuse. The internet is full of simple and tasty recipes.", "Nta.   He's an entitled child throwing a whiney tantrum. Don't reward him for that.  \n\nYes, it's easy to just cook a piece of meat. Heat a pan. Season steak with salt and pepper.  Sear for 3-4 minuts on each side. Done. Easy enough that he can simply do it on his own right next to you.", "NTA - Because he gives you no money on groceries which is just crazy. Yes he should definitely buy his own meat if he wants to eat it. But also you need to have him chipping in on groceries.", "NTA, It'd only be forcing your beliefs on him if you stopped him from cooking for himself. Sounds like a child who's mad that he's responsible for washing his own clothes. The fact that you're in charge of paying and cooking with no input from him means that whatever you buy is up to you. He doesn't like it, he can start contributing himself.\n\nPS, you might like the cookbook series \"Eat like you give a fuck\", lots of flavorful dishes to choose from there.\n\nAnd some favorite replacements as a meat eater:  \nJust Egg frozen patties - better than the weird eggs on mcdonalds breakfast sandwiches, super fast breakfast sandwiches in the morning  \nMorningstar bacon - for crispy smokey flavor on your sandwiches  \nGardein's chicken patties in the black bag - I use these for everything. Salad? gonna get a patty. Japanese katsu curry? Going to get a patty. Chicken parm? going to get a patty topped in cheese and tomato sauce.\n\nAvoid beyond sausages in the link shape like the plague, they smell horrible cooked. Impossible sausage or beyond sausage at dunkin and starbucks have been the only thing I order from either for a couple years now.", "NTA, but you really should have made it clear before he sat down to eat that you would not be stocking meat at all. His reaction makes him 100% TA here, but surprising him with it was still a sign of poor communication. He'd be right to be a little irritated about that, but he wasn't a little irritated, he was a giant baby.", "NTA. And please dump his ass.", "NTA it's silly that he except you to buy and cook meat you have no intention of eating since he has basically been eating food you are cooking for yourself and have been willing to share.", "My wife is a vegetarian and I\u2019m not. I only eat meat if it\u2019s takeout we\u2019re ordering or for my work lunches, and I do all the menu planning and shopping and cooking - I just cook vegetarian dishes. Find someone who respects you.", "ESH for the overall lack of communication on how your new diet would impact the household. You just decided by yourself that you're not cooking meat anymore without discussing it at all. He overreacted to one meal.", "I cook for my girlfriend who is vegan. I typically cook my meat separate and add it to my dish separately. He could consider doing that. \n\nOnly thing I\u2019ll say is you could have given him a heads up that you wouldn\u2019t COOK meat for him in addition to not cooking it for yourself as he may have assumed you\u2019d have no problems cooking it for him. \n\nIn any case, NTA, just work out a plan with him and he\u2019ll likely need to start contributing, which it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s been doing.", "You kind of sprung it on him. If you were going to change his diet as well as your own you should have given him fair warning that he would be responsible for his own meat based meals.", "ESH. If you had an already established arrangement of cooking meals you both like, then yes YATA for suddenly switching to meatless without even telling him. He should have had a heads up so that he ample time to get a meat option, as many people do not feel full or nutritionally complete without a meat protein. HOWEVER he is also TA for throwing a fit like a child. He's an adult, and should behave like one. Everyone sucks here", "ESH. Learn how to communicate.", "NTA  \nBut if you are going shopping then you could buy the stuff he wants too. I mean...its efficient that way. Its basic stuff that you buy things for your partner too. The main problem here is that you are the only one who buys/cooks. You should both put effort into these. For example if he goes grocery shopping he should think about vegan options for you too. Communication is the key here.", "ESH\n\n> If I'm not going to be eating it, I don't want to buy or cook it.\n\nBoth of you should have sat down and talked about what this meant going forward, instead you made a decision for both of you and he flew off the handle rather quickly.", "ESH. \n\n> I told him how I didn't want to buy or cook meat anymore since it was no longer part of my diet.\n\nPerfectly reasonable, but you should have told him that when you decided it. IDK how it got to the point where he was surprised there was no meat in the house, did the two of you never have a conversation about it?", "YTA\n\nI do not know how you to split up roles and finances so assuming that is not part of the issue you are creating more work for you two.\n\nNow he has to also go grocery shopping also. You want two different meals to be cooked.  You will eat together less often.\n\nHe is having a big baby tantrum over you passive aggressive plan.  Think about what your goal in the relationship is.", "YTA. \n\nThe two of you have shared and differentiated responsibilities in the house which had a prior understanding that there would be meat available. You changed that by surprise and arbitrarily determined you would no longer be shopping for meat.\n\nChange this to diet coke - if you were doing the grocery shopping for the house and bought diet coke every week, it would be an asshole thing to suddenly refuse to shop for diet coke because you aren't drinking it anymore.\n\nOf course he shouldn't be \"lashing out at you\" but I refuse to judge based upon all of the dressing added on top of the real issue.", "YTA, for not communicating this up front. You created this problem because you chose not to tell him that you were changing the longstanding dynamic of shopping and cooking meat. You knew he wasn't going vegetarian, you had chicken on hand, but you still served him a meal based on YOUR new diet, and acted surprised when he didn't like it?  A simple conversation before hand would have given you both a chance to figure out how to manage the 'new' shopping/cooking situation. What you did instead was very passive-aggressive, and designed to create this exact conflict.", "So my parents, two of the most wonderful people on this planet, one is a vegan, one isn\u2019t. They manage and they cope. When mum cooks, it\u2019s vegan and she will cook meat separately for him. When dad cooks, it\u2019s vegan but he\u2019ll cook some meat separately. \n\nTo an extent, I\u2019d say YTA. \n\nSaying this, you BF should be paying their way and contributing to household tasks equally. The fact he\u2019s a grown man and doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s concerning. \n\nSo, to this extent, I\u2019d say NTA. \n\nWhat seems to be an issue here is communication, expectation and respect. Try and have a calm and sensible conversation where instead of things like \u2018typical vegan\u2019 are said, \u201cthis is how I feel about the situation..\u201d is said and a compromise reached. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, me and my husband haven\u2019t had a row in over a decade of being together, because we learnt from past relationships and started ours off on the basis of communication and mutual respect in all things.", "ESH. Weird. Yet another thread where the parties don't communicate and it blows up in their faces...\n\nYTA for not communicating your plans. He's the AH for complaining, pouting, and not just getting his own groceries. Now would the reaction have been different if you let him know ahead of time so he has a chance to get his own groceries?

He makes his own money, he can buy his own damn meat and coke", "I don't shop for the household. I shop for the things I want. My bf is just welcome to help himself. I don't like frozen pizzas or Rap Snacks but my bf does, so he buys those things for himself. \nWe're not some movie couple who sits down to a meal together every night. It's more like I leave a pot of food on the stove and let him know it's there after making my plate.", "how is she forcing him to be vegan", "Nope, we split all other bills. I just buy all the groceries because I'm used to it and have to have a stocked kitchen", "My diet is his diet. He gets to eat whatever I cook for myself. If he doesn't like something I cook, he makes or buys his own food. \nI don't know why he's suddenly complaining about the lack of meat as if I'm supposed to suddenly start making something special for him. The whole \"typical vegan\" comment really makes me wonder if he has some kind of issues with vegetarians/vegans or something... although that doesn't make much since because he was supportive when I first told him.", "I don't resent him for not helping. His reaction to me not making meat anymore just pissed me off considering he doesn't even pay for these things or help make them. If he acted grateful for all I do I wouldn't have a problem with doing it, considering I would be cooking and shopping for myself anyway.", "Acting like the typical vegan because I'm not gonna cook something I'm not going to eat? If I didn't eat eggplant I wouldn't cook it. Why should I put more effort into making a meal that I am in no way obligated to make in the first place? \n\nPlus it's not like I'm cooking food he can't eat. If I put meat into all of the things I made for that dinner, or even simply put some on the side, he would have eaten it without a problem. \n\nIt's starting to look to me like he was just waiting for the opportunity to accuse me of forcing him to go vegan.", "It\u2019s not a rotten way to run a relationship, between two mature adults. What\u2019s missing here is OP\u2019s boyfriend isn\u2019t mature at all. \n\nMy partner and I both buy separate food and cook for ourselves, because like in this situation I don\u2019t eat meat bc it makes me also feel sick, but my partner still eats meat. \n\nBoyfriend doesn\u2019t want to cook for himself like an adult and is trying to bully OP into doing it by getting her family involved. Very immature.", ">OP is the one that's changing the state of the relationship. Instead of finding ways to work together and thrive in partnership, she's unwinding it. \n\nThis depends on if they had a discussion about her cooking as being part of her share of the household chores or not. If they sat down and dis ussed chores and came to an agreement that OP would do more of the cooking in exchange for the bf taking on more of some other chore, then yeah, it's a bit of a jerk move to suddenly change that with no warning. But if they never talked about it and this arrangement just formed naturally, then it stands to reason that OP can change it whenever she wants.", "She absolutely should not have to prepare it. Pick it up while she\u2019s at the store anyways and have him pay her back for it? Sure. But he can do the work to prep it if he wants it. Or just get things like deli meat, rotisserie chicken, jerky, frozen chicken etc and he can easily add those to his meals. But he needs to do some of the work here.", "I agree that she should have discussed it with BF first, but there is still no way OP is an asshole when she buys all the groceries herself and does most of the cooking.\n\nBF doesn't sound like he ever even chips in some money for groceries and only very rarely cooks, which means he has zero right to complain about the food. \n\nHe can either get over it and stop acting like a spoiled child or buy and cook his own meals like a normal adult.", "I will never understand how people feel it\u2019s such a big deal that they have to eat the occasional meal without meat. Most meat eaters, myself included, circumstantially eat meals or snacks without meat all the time. Certain pastas, salads, etc. Enjoying eating meat in many situations does not equate to a mandate that meat must be part of every bite of food that enters your mouth. Saying he was blindsided by this is a bit dramatic. Having to eat one dinner that doesn\u2019t contain a meat serving is a hugely inconsequential thing, even if you prefer having a meat option. Upon noticing no meat he could have simply clarified if this would be her approach going forward, and if so discussed what options exist to ensure he has meat in the future, since he prefers that. If the option is that he shops and cooks for himself, so be it. This is a very entitled approach to someone else feeding you, and is being made out to be damaging when really it\u2019s a simple preference. We all eat things that aren\u2019t our first choice from time to time and are no worse off for it. Behaving like you\u2019ve been victimized is ridiculous.\n\nEdited to add NTA", "Disagree. OP could have been clearer that removing meat from her own diet meant removing it from her grocery lists and menu plans, but that's not an AH move, it's just a miscommunication. The only way the boyfriend was able to be blindsided by this is by already being such an AH that he has apparently been letting her shoulder the full burden of planning, shopping, and paying for food.  (Note: this wouldn't inherently make someone an AH, I am assuming that if there were a good reason, like if he were disabled, or had an equally large chunk of household responsibilities that he handled by himself, OP would have mentioned that.) Plus, he flipped out at being served the FIRST vegetarian meal, which says to me this is about not getting what he wants at all times, not about having meat removed from his diet.\n\nI do almost all the cooking in my family, but my husband and I come up with meal ideas and make grocery lists together so we both get the items we want no matter who does the shopping, and so the planning and remembering doesn't all fall on me. If you leave your partner to do all that work and then you just show up to eat once your plate is full, and THEN throw a fit about what's on it?? Nope. OP is NTA.", "Are you really suggesting that the BF should pay ONLY for his own meat but OP should still provide all his other food for him. Surely he should either be contributing to the cost of the rest of his food or buying all his own.", "If the man wants an opinion about the food in the house he needs to pay for it and shop for it. If he can't do either, he gets whats there . Same if he doesn't like what's cooked for him, he can make his own food", "Except he forgot the part in traditional roles where the guy is the breadwinner and provides the food for the \"little lady\" to cook ...", "He was obviously a dick but it seems kind of passive aggressive to change a consistent home task / diet without making any mention of it until after the fact. She was obviously pissed about the groceries and cooking and never said anything then used his lashing out as her chance to unload her pent up frustration. Maybe have a talk, oh about a year ago, about how to divide home tasks and expenses instead of using the dietary change as the problem. ESH.", "Girl, this is how he reacts to the *massive favor* of providing hot meals for him?", "Then maybe you should buy food only for you, cook only for you and let him fend for himself.

If so I can see the argument for that to balance out you doing the cooking, but it still doesn't make sense that you don't split grocery costs if you split everything else", "Absolutely.  OP is doing her boyfriend a **HUGE** favor by cooking the food.  From the one meal she mentioned, she goes the extra mile in her meal preparation.  \n\nHe should also be fair and always wash and put away the dishes.  That's the long-standing agreement my roommates and I have.  \n\nI hope he does that, but I'm afraid he does not.", "Oh he was 100% taking advantage of you. It would have been nice of you to give him a heads up that you were no longer going to buy meat, but not doing so certainly doesn't make you an asshole. He's been mooching off of you and now he can either eat what you cook or buy and make his own damn food. And getting his family involved???

And maybe resentment was a bit of a leap on my part, but the fact that you keep bringing up that you pay for groceries makes it seem as though that bothers you too which is something partners should discuss (honesty who pays for groceries is something that I think anyone cohabitating should discuss fully). \n\nBut even if you never expect him to pay for groceries or cook for himself, telling him that you're going vegetarian doesn't automatically mean that you're only going to cook vegetarian (which is where my judgement came in). To be clear, I think it's totally reasonable not to want to cook something you won't eat. But unless you made it specifically clear that he'd be on his own for meat, I can see why he'd think that not much would change for him (which does NOT mean he was justified in throwing a tantrum and walking out but I could understand a level of annoyance).", "The only reason I said she should prepare as a compromise is because she is already doing the cooking and she wants to be doing it because she enjoys the activity.  We don't know the size of their kitchen so it may be very difficult to impossible for both of them to be in the kitchen at the same time.  If that's the case, then the meat would have to be prepared before or after the rest of the meal so one portion would be cold by the time that he eats.\n\nThey could each prepare their own meals except for the fact that OP states that she always cooks too much food regardless if BF eats or not so they would end up spending more money on food than they do now.", ">there is still no way OP is an asshole when she buys all the groceries herself and does most of the cooking.\n\nThere is important information missing before you can make this judgement. For example, what if their agreement is that she pays for groceries and cooks, and he pays for utilities/wifi or something and does other chores? In that case, she's definitely an asshole for doing this. If they split everything else besides groceries and she always shops and cooks and all that then that's just not a healthy split, unless he works more and makes more money, then that could be offset. Really just not enough info about how their relationship and living together works", "This! \n\nIt's weird that he even noticed for the first meal. I thought most people had at least one or two vegetarian meals that they cook regularly.", "No, they had arrangement that was working for them and I was making no judgement on the arrangement they implicitly or explicitly had.

I'm only pissed now and snapped at him because he was complaining about what I bought and what I cooked.

Has he offered to pay you for food and you said no?", ">Why would it be fair for me to buy all of the groceries if he makes more money than me?\n\nI worded that wrong, I meant more like if he works more then it would make more sense for you to do a larger share of chores, and if he works more he likely makes more money.

There are some guideline online which can help (like 3 mid sized potatoes in a three dish meal, traditionally veggies/ meat.) I now cook only what I can eat in one sitting. Of course, I still sometimes overestimate and have a small serving of leftovers, but never a full meal, more of a snack. \n\nIt could also help to do some weeks with a meal box: Portions are fixed, no additional ingredients.

He may decide veggie is the way to go pretty quickly once he actually has to take responsibility for buying.\n\nThe real issue for me is that he thinks it's ok for his family to go after you.
