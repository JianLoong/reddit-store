This should have been a joint decision BEFORE you started playing it with your kid.

You are taking advantage of her responsibility and care to seem like the \"fun\" parent, and if you continue disrespecting her in front of your child, there's a high possibility that they will tolerate that type of treatment from their future partners when they grow up.

If you had pulled her aside, explained to her the themes, your rationale, and maybe some guidelines (ie: he doesn\u2019t play unless you play with him, you guys have conversation about what is right/wrong throughout the game etc.) she may have changed her mind. That being said, she may still not have been comfortable with him playing & it would have been a good time to establish media rules in general (ie: no GOT during the day, no unsupervised screen time etc.), but you guys would have been able to have a discussion with your son that was either - \u201chey, mom & I talked & decided you\u2019re mature enough to play\u201d or \u201csorry buddy, your mom has good points and we think this game is better saved for in a few years.\u201d This stops mom from being the \u201cbad guy\u201d and teaches your child to have equal respect for both parents rules as he knows it will be backed up by the other parent. This is ESPECIALLY important now that you\u2019re getting up to teenage years. \n\nAs a side note I will say that in todays day & age he is likely exposed to way worse & I believe strongly in controlled/supervised screen time.

Are people really consulting with the other parent before playing games or watching shows with their kids?", "Question, he decided it was ok, she came in while they were playing and told him to shut it off.\n\nHow exactly is this not her undermining him?", "this is wild, detroit become human is a very mild game in regards to violence / gore etc. it has mature themes, but themes that a 12 year old can understand. \n\ni was playing gta from a younger age and turned out fine, children aren\u2019t as thick as you think", "But a group that's not into videogames would have \"opinions\" that are utterly asinine, such as the old gem \"violent videogames make people violent\". \n\nIn fact, I just re-read it, and she literally thinks it will teach the kid \"murder is ok\"\n\nNon gamer \"opinions\" like this are factual statements pretending to be opinions. They don't matter because they're factually incorrect\n\n\nI played way worse as a kid and ended up a pretty empathetic adult. At no point did they teach me to be anything this woman said.", "There are still a lot of people who hate video games just because video game.", "This isn\u2019t like someone I knew who let her like 5 year old watch The Walking Dead and didn\u2019t see any issues with it.

OP is definitely NTA.", "As someone who\u2019s played Detroit and seen GOT, she is a hugeee asshole. It\u2019s totally okay to let your kid see mature content if you know they can handle it and if you take the time to explain it to them so they don\u2019t misunderstand or internalize anything bad but GOT is *miles* more graphic, mature, and frankly evil than that game is. GOT is also way more nuanced in whether or not the things shown are bad. It\u2019s entire point and theme is questioning morality and a battle of good vs evil. Sometimes you do evil things for the greater good and sometimes you do evil things to be evil, and sometimes the evil people are more cool or successful, etc etc etc.\n\nFfs the first episode alone in GOT has graphic incest and is a reoccurring theme up until the very last episode. Detroit is exclusively about standing up against discrimination and double standards, or learning to stand up for yourself and for what is right. It mostly has pretty clear cut right vs wrong story lines even if the situations themselves are quite mature.", "My thoughts exactly! It's a very thoughtful, philosophical game that really has the opportunity to foster some great conversations with the kid.", "There are probably better ways to facilitate those conversations without exposing children to age inappropriate content. I get that in this internet era they're smacked with way more than when we were kids but it doesn't mean we have to add one more bit of negative content for them to consume.", "> I played first person shooters at 13, I turned out alright\n\nDid you though?;\n\n> In 2 years when the son is begging mom to chop his penis off\n\nPress F to doubt.", "GTA was the motivation I needed to stop using the family console and get my own to keep in my room.

I didn\u2019t even do the missions, I just tried to find those cars with the flames on the hood and then use a cheat code to get a 5 star wanted level and a tank", "I agree. It's good some great discussion points about treating others well, discrimination, etc. GOT otoh is violent and extremely sexual.", "How do you know if they're actually up to it unless it's too late though?\n\nLet your kid have a break from all the negativity and bullshit they're being pelted with day in and out seems the greater kindness.", "But mom's reasoning for not allowing their son to play this video game is, \"that it teaches kids to curse and that racial discrimination, child abuse and murder is okay.\" She basically described the plot of GOT.", "Overseer, nice", "To be fair most people would want the wife to do the same thing.its a two yes situation that people are aiming for", "I\u2019ve seen at least 5 people suggest this, and just no. My wife and I are both parents and would never dream of having to \u201cask permission from the other\u201d for anything like this.

In general terms about 'how do we feel about kid watching/playing stuff with an older recommended age' if not about the specific media. Parents are supposed to work together.", "Fucking right? \n\nNothing I've read indicated he wasn't doing any sorta parenting", "Sadly, this. \nI'm a gamer myself, with kids. Honestly, I've felt more present and active with my kids as they grow up while playing a video game together (they watch and have snacks, etc.) Letting them help make choices, talk about sceneries etc. Then I have with watching a cartoon. \n\nI'll never understand this whole hating on video games, while being a zombie on the phone or in front of a TV (with some shows being 10 times worse than a lot of games) is perfectly fine. \n(No hate if tv or something is anyones hobby)", "The only benefit of the doubt I give people like this is that news media makes the distinction that interactive violent media like video games have worse outcomes for children because they are the player controlling the actions. And regular TV and movies are more of a passive viewing experience.  \n\nWe know this isn't true. Studies debunk this time and again but mainstream news sources still pump this myth out there as if it's absolute truth. It's hard to separate that out when it's been a regular headline since Columbine.", "Yeah when the kid is a little older maybe 14 I would have suggested the telltale walking dead series to. Also if you want a nice bonding one that's quite calm and fun power washing simulatior is good for that", "Sorry, but that made me chuckle \ud83e\udd2d\nI honestly don\u2019t know how people can control their cars on GTA.

Lol.", ">that it teaches kids to curse and that racial discrimination, child abuse and murder is okay.\"\n\nAlso that's not even correct lol, Detroit become human is literally the opposite where it deals with the issues of racism and child abuse, one of the characters main motivation is saving a kid from abuse", "It giving you goosebumps does not make it inappropriate for children. A 12 year old is likely learning about the holocaust and viewing far more graphic material in history. \n\nThe worst part would likely be the strip club but that isn't graphic.", "I watched a YouTuber play Detroit when I was only 10.  I did not have any problems with the scenes and I get really good marks for my final exam this year  my whole family was happy so I don't know what you are talking about.

I have 5 nephews, and somehow I am able to connect to them, and when they are talking about games or their general interest, I know what they are talking about, last time we even had a debate on what the hourly cost of a game is acceptable. In their opinion anything below 2 cents/hour is just a waste of money. I'm proud and sad at the same time. Proud because this shows they are aware of the value of money, and sad because this principle alone will exclude them from awesome stories and experiences single player games have to offer.\n\nOh the TV argument is spot on. 5 hours of TV a day (that was the average if I remember correclty), and noone bats an eye.
