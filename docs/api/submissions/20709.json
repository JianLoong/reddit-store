The problem isn\u2019t the video game per say, it\u2019s undermining her in front of your child. If my husband and I disagree from a parenting perspective we default to stopping the activity, and having a discussion about it behind closed doors where we can come to an agreement then present a united front. In this situation I would have turned off the game and said - hey, mom & I are just gonna have a quick conversation, watch some SpongeBob & I\u2019ll be right back. \n\nUnfortunately if your wife expresses that she does not want him to partake in an activity & you argue against it in front of him, or worse, still allow your child to do the activity despite him knowing his mom didn\u2019t want him to do it, you\u2019re telling him that you have final say & your wife\u2019s opinion or rules are not as important as yours. If you had pulled her aside, explained to her the themes, your rationale, and maybe some guidelines (ie: he doesn\u2019t play unless you play with him, you guys have conversation about what is right/wrong throughout the game etc.) she may have changed her mind. That being said, she may still not have been comfortable with him playing & it would have been a good time to establish media rules in general (ie: no GOT during the day, no unsupervised screen time etc.), but you guys would have been able to have a discussion with your son that was either - \u201chey, mom & I talked & decided you\u2019re mature enough to play\u201d or \u201csorry buddy, your mom has good points and we think this game is better saved for in a few years.\u201d This stops mom from being the \u201cbad guy\u201d and teaches your child to have equal respect for both parents rules as he knows it will be backed up by the other parent. This is ESPECIALLY important now that you\u2019re getting up to teenage years. \n\nAs a side note I will say that in todays day & age he is likely exposed to way worse & I believe strongly in controlled/supervised screen time.

Wrong place but I gotta spill this after my brother ranted all this to me that one time.\n\nLike, (spoilers for the basic plot of the story) Markus is supposed to be like, a civil rights leader or something, but androids are machines, you know? They were never conscious until Markus gave them the virus or they bonked their head wrong. Fix that and they\u2019re robots again. As far as I remember from the story, they\u2019re human-shaped roombas until the virus kicks in\u2014to say not giving them consciousness is unethical is to say not giving your phone consciousness is unethical\u2014you could also say not having babies constantly is unethical. \n\nTaking that consciousness away is wrong, but never giving that consciousness in the first place is not. It\u2019s also weird to put the Civil Rights Leader role in Markus\u2019s hands, as he was the best-treated android out of everyone\u2014why not Kara?\n\nI also didn\u2019t like >!the twist that the child running away with Kara was an android. It felt like the whole point of her story was that humans and androids can connect, and the twist just takes that away!<. I feel like the person who threw that in wanted to feel clever.\n\nBesides the story and its premise is the messaging. Markus\u2019s movement does better if you\u2019re peaceful. It shows people watching TV understanding your movement more and siding with it easier. I dislike this. \n\nSee, I\u2019m black and grew up being taught about the Black Panthers, and I am still learning about the violence used in the Civil Rights Movement that got me my basic rights in the United States. It\u2019s not just black people, the Suffragettes were violent (reluctant to include them since they excluded black women), and so were LGBT people during Stonewall. I mean, we\u2019re taught in schools here about the violence of the American revolution. And for that, none of my teachers were ever like \u201cthey should have been peaceful\u201d. For the Civil Rights Movement, peace is the best thing ever, but for the American Revolution, violence is cool as fuck.\n\nIt sounds like a tangent but it\u2019s really not. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 was a direct result of rioting. I cannot name a single successful attempt to change an oppressive system that didn\u2019t involve a lot of violent action.\n\nSo when the game says, with multiple undertones and references to real movements against oppression, that peacefulness is the only way and the correct way, that annoys the fuck outta me. I mean besides the implication it\u2019s just not realistic. Detroit: Become Human\u2019s hyper-technological society is even more distant and soul sucking than the one we\u2019re currently living in, and you\u2019re telling me they would have empathy for androids doing a march if they saw it on TV once? When the FBI killed MLK, he had a 75% disapproval rate while still being smeared as a violent actor by the media, and that was before technology was used to try to commodify human connection and emotion.\n\nI have a lotta love for this game though. Anything that tries something new earns my appreciation. It also put my city back on the map as something other than \u201cghetto ghetto crime, ghetto crime, crime, ghetto\u201d.
