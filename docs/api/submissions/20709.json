We had fun until my wife (f31) told us to stop playing and that it teaches kids to curse and that racial discrimination, child abuse and murder is ok.\n\nI tried explaining that the entire point of Markus's storyline is that it isn't and she got pissed and starting saying how she gets to parent too and that he was her son too, so I turned off the game, told my kid to go play in his room and told her that if she didn't like it, she could leave the room and let us have our fun in peace. She told me I was undermining her and that I was being an asshole, then made me promise I wouldn't play it with him again.\n\nSo AITA? I don't think I am but it'd be nice to see other people's opinion on it.\n\n\nEdit: so I agree that I should've asked and made sure it was ok, but I did not think it was a big deal as she watches GOT whenever she wants regardless if he's there or not. I don't complain because he knows that it's bad. I explained it to him and he understood.\n\nAlso, I was not trying to be a \"cool dad\", I was just trying to explain that the game didn't promote those themes. And my son was in his room when we were arguing. So I wasn't undermining her in front of him.", "created_utc": 1687841848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14k3vqq/aita_for_letting_my_kid_play_a_17_game_with_me/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The thing not to do is to play it with him anyway or behind her back.", "NTA. You are spending time with your kid. Supervising a game is totally different than just handling him a game and letting him play 24/7. \n\nYou both have a say as to what\u2019s appropriate or not. Her whole statement could be turned around and said back to her and it is as equally valid. Shit is hard these days on kids, giving them a break from the real world is not a bad thing. Not sure where you are located but here in the US our kids start active shooter drills in kindergarten. If you spend time with your child and talk to them about life, I guarantee he knows the difference between right and wrong. \n\nI know you did not ask but since you are curious as to what others think I am a mom of three, two are adults and the oldest is expecting their first child. He played all of those games and he is a productive member of society.", "Detroit Become Human is one of the tamer games you could play in front of your child. I think your wife has a very narrow view of gaming and is also quite the hypocrite if she's got a brutally graphic and violent show like GoT on if the kid is around.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. All the comments really don\u2019t know what Detroit become human is about and it really shows \ud83d\udc80. Y\u2019all should be worried if it was GTA or something.", "NAH\nWhile there is nothing wrong with a kid watching or playing media rated for an older audience if they have the maturity to handle it, it may be best to get the OK from your wife as well in the future.", "Nta for letting your kids playing that game WITH YOU.\n\nIts a different story if u let him play on his own, yes.\n\nBut next time, discuss with ur wife beforehand. Theres still some games with robots in it. Ex : Stray, Ratchet and Clank (rated E).", "Lol by 12 years old most kids have seen some crazy shit on the internet. NTA at all", "As a parent of a child who is really good at games, it's actually really difficult to find games that are challenging enough while also being appropriate and having appropriate themes and storylines.\n\nWe let our son plan assassin's creed and horizon zero dawn, shadow of war, and other games. We turn off the gore or blood where possible, but it isn't always possible. We also choose games that have a storyline he will be interested in, so it isn't just violence for violence sale. And we don't let him play games that we think are too much for him personally. He doesn't like jump scares and doesn't like anything too gory, so we don't let him play games that are too scary or gory. \n\nBut he has ended up playing a lot of M and some MA games (in Australia, so out rating system is slightly different). He's 11 now, but he was playing HZD and assassin's creed games when he was about 6 or 7.\n\nBasically, it isn't necessarily about the game rating, but about knowing your kid, knowing the game, and making sure the game is a good fit for your kid, and isn't too scary or violent, or have themes that are going to be too difficult for them.", "NTA   \nHe's 12, he isn't absolutely braindead.", "Maybe I'd understand a bit if she didn't let him watch game of thrones lol.  I played games like duke3d and phantasmagoria which is probably worse when i was that age without my parents consent. If he's not allowed to play a game he'll probably find a way  of playing it anyway nta", "NTA.. Ive played and completed it years ago.. Out of all the age related games a 12 year old shouldn't be playing.. That's extremely mild.. The story is amazing and lessons can be learnt.\n\nAlthough, from your wife's reaction.. I'm guessing you knew she might not be happy about it.", "NTA - Detroit Become Human is a mature game with serious themes but they\u2019re approached very well and frankly that game is absolutely something I would want my kid to engage with at some point. Some kids might get scared by some scenes, but frankly most kids will have seen more disturbing shit in a kids Halloween movie. What a fantastic way to open up discussion about important issues with your kid, in a way that history class does for some but not for everyone. Plus, you\u2019re playing With your kid - not letting him experience it alone. If he\u2019s worried or has questions? You\u2019re right there. \n\nYour wife needs to learn to trust YOUR judgement as a parent. Just because she\u2019s the mum doesn\u2019t mean her opinion is more important than yours. Especially if she\u2019s going to be insanely hypocritical and have GOT on when your kid is around, considering how brutal, violent, and sexual that show is.", "NTA lol that's the exact age I watched jacksepticeye play it. It would be so fun to play it w my dad if he was into gaming", "NTA I love watching my daughter play RE4 on our PS5 as well as other games.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This should have been a joint decision BEFORE you started playing it with your kid. And before you let your kid even watch you play it. 17+ games are rated that way for a reason; there's mature content that isn't age appropriate for a 12 year old. It's not OK for you to unilaterally decide to expose your son to that. Your wife may be wrong about the game teaching your son bad things, but she still has a right to be involved in raising him, and she has a right to not want him exposed to cursing, child abuse, and murder at his age. You ARE undermining your wife.", "NTA When i was 6 years old my older brother let me watch him play GTA even though it's an 18+.The only thing it did do was inspire me to become a gamer myself when i got a bit older,it never had any bad impact on me.", "YTA\n\nHe's not just your kid, he's yours and your wife's kid. You made this decision without consulting her and when she was clearly upset you just brushed it off and decided you'd get to play cool dad and make your wife seem like the bad parent to the kid.\n\nHad you talked with your wife before purchasing it, it would have been much easier to explain the nuances. Some M games are fine for 12 year olds to play given the parents put thought into it. It sounds like you did! Next time you need to let your wife in on that thought before you actually make the decision.", "YTA\n\n\nThat game really isn't something for a 12 year old in my opinion.", "YTA- you are undermining your wife. If you truly believe that the game is appropriate for a 12 year old, you could have stopped temporarily to have a private, respectful conversation with your wife to help calm her fears about the game. Instead, you disrespected her, made even worse by the fact that it was in front of your child. You are taking advantage of her responsibility and care to seem like the \"fun\" parent, and if you continue disrespecting her in front of your child, there's a high possibility that they will tolerate that type of treatment from their future partners when they grow up. Wake up, dude. She's trying her best to protect and raise a child and you're actively undermining her and belittling her.", "YTA. You\u2019re the \u201cfun\u201d irresponsible dad that leaves the actual parenting to the mom. There\u2019s a reason there are age ranges on video games.", "NTA and YTA both.  She has a right to say what she is comfortable with but she should have asked you to pause it and address it out of earshot of the kid.   YTA for not asking her opinion before playing it with your son since it is marked a higher age than he is.\n\nThat said, he has probably seen and heard much worse and she doesn\u2019t seem to understand the game yet is assuming it\u2019s harmful.", "The worst thing the kid will see in the game is a revolution for rights \ud83d\ude44 NTA", "oh is that so?\ncould you give me your reasoning if you're so well aware of the game?", "How much is your opinion really worth, given that you're ranting how he should have had this conversation in private with his wife... When that is exactly what he did, which shows that you literally don't know what you're talking about?", "Kid wasn\u2019t there", "Game of thrones is way worse than this video game. And also age ratings on games don\u2019t always align with how graphic it is, for example there is a Star Wars game with an age rating of 16 that contains as much violence as the movie which I would say is appropriate for people younger then 16", "What parenting is he not doing?", "The kid has definitely seen and heard much worse considering the Mom is watching GOT in front of him.", "Lol\n\n\nI did play the game if you try to imply I'm not. \n\n\nAnd I don't think that the death scenes are that light. Alone the scene with clara at the harbor if you get caught. The one that feels like a concentration camp gave me goose bumbs."]}
