We get a little attitude when ordering but no biggie. \n\nOur food comes and I notice that our Saag Paneer (spinach with cheese) dish has no paneer in it. I thought it was odd and I pointed it out to the waiter. He tried to tell me that the paneer had melted, and it was in the spinach. Now, I\u2019m no expert on Indian cuisine but I\u2019ve never in my life heard of paneer melting. I thought maybe I had chosen the wrong dish, like I ordered a dish without paneer but when I tried asking more about it, like, the guy just kept pretending like he didn\u2019t understand me, was sneerily smiling back and I realized he intended to do nothing about it. He kept saying it melted and eventually I just said whatever don\u2019t worry about it.\n\nThis kinda pissed me off cause I was pretty sure they messed up but my buddy just told me to brush it off. He said he felt like an asshole being a white guy causing a scene in an Indian restaurant but I was increasingly annoyed cause it felt like they were punking us and thought we wouldn\u2019t know better. We finish our meal and we bounce. On the way out I look up paneer and whether or not it can melt and it turns out it does not melt, period. So the guy was lying to us and the fact that he had the audacity to lie to our face had me pretty pissed.\n\nI left a very vocal, annoyed, yelp review and moved on. The next day the manager messaged me and told me he wanted to comp our meal and that he fired the guy. I didn\u2019t mean for him to get fired I just wanted him to maybe get a talking to so he doesn\u2019t have the audacity to keep doing that shit.

Having been a waiter I would have first clarified what you thought was wrong.

Obviously the waiter's a dick but he didn't make the food wrong, and however he acted, sacking a guy off the evidence of a Yelp review is pretty terrible management. To the point I wouldn't be surprised if he's just saying that to hope you'll come back. \n\nAnyway no, leaving a review isn't the bad behaviour here, you're in the clear.", "NTA. I know it feels horrible but the waiter deserved it and like everyone else said ,he has done this before.", "NTA. Paneer is often blended in with saag because it\u2019s not always cured into form blocks. No one gets fired over one comment like that though.", "NTA.  While I'm not Indian, I'm married to one.  I have no idea how you'd melt paneer if you're cooking it correctly.  The dude flat-out lied to your face. He deserved to be fired.", "Oh really? So you think it\u2019s actually possible it was blended with the spinach?", "NTA. The waiter was being very rude. And I'm guessing this wasn't the first complaint against this guy. I work in the customer service industry (not food service), and trust me when I say that everyone gets complained about at least once, no matter how friendly and good at your job you are. If you don't tell a customer what they want to hear, they say you're rude. A good manager knows to take most complaints with a grain of salt. I've never heard of someone getting fired over one complaint. So that leads me to believe that there's a pattern of complaints against this guy, the manager might have talked to him about it before, and after this incident the manager decided he'd had enough of this guy.", "NTA. And the way Sag Paneer s usually made, they had to fish the paneer out on purpose just to be TAH. That as much as anything- tampering with customer food like that?  that could be a health code violation, and just plain makes the restaurant look terrible.  I waited tables for more than a decade- you DO NOT act like that and expect to keep your job.", "Ah you know what, their website actually shows a picture of the saag paneer dish I ordered and there\u2019s clearly paneer chunks in it. OK lol, I think it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m NTA, I was worried for a sec lol.", "Paneer behaves a little like feta, so you can cube it or crumble it. It\u2019s possible it was crumbled in with the spinach sauce, but you\u2019d still be able to see it and it definitely wouldn\u2019t be melted. Mind you, while I think you\u2019re NTA, it\u2019s a weird scenario - why did the kitchen send out the dish like this? Mistake or deliberate? If it was a mistake, I don\u2019t get why the waiter wouldn\u2019t help to resolve it, (he\u2019s an AH) if it was deliberate, then they\u2019re all AH."]}
