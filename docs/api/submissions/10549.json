Josie offered to pay me when they were dating but I said no.  Now that we all live together, she\u2019s been trying to make me deal with them more and more, usually while my dad\u2019s not home. My dad thinks I should bond with them more but he said I don\u2019t have to babysit.  Josie keeps trying to pull the \u201cjust watch them for an hour while I go to the store\u201d or loading me up with chores since I\u2019m not watching the kids.

Josie still couldn\u2019t find me, but I slipped out before my dad came home and was laying on my bed with a book when he got there. Josie got big mad asking where I\u2019ve been and I said in my room. My dad showed her the location I sent when she said I was lying and snuck out.

They're not your kids or siblings, you didn't ask for any of this to happen, and your free time/study time should be the first thing that was considered in this move. \n\nYou might want to say something to Josie like 'I've done my chores, I'm going to my room now, I have work to do, and I'd like to not be disturbed until x hours' rather than keep up the attic hideaway thing, because I can see that ending up being all your fault when it gets found out.\n\nStudy hard, focus yourself on your future, hopefully you can soon go to college or whatever and leave Josie to look after her own kids.", "NTA, but don't do this too often or you'll reveal your secret spot.  Josie needs to realize OP isn't on call 24/7 (or at all) to be her babysitting service.\n\nThis is a tough spot for OP, though.  I would try documenting her behavior for a couple of weeks and having a talk with dad about Josie trying to unload parenting her kids.", "While this is an amazing temporary solution, I don't think this will work long term.\n\nNTA, but I think you need a different tactic in the future.", "NTA. Delete this post before they find out. Lol.", "Record the times she asks you to do extra chores or push you into watching her kids even when you deny it. Don't send them to your Dad immediately. Let him know that she's forcing you. Let her deny it and then play the recording for both of them.

You say that you've tried but your dad doesn't believe you and your mom accuses you of disrespect.\n\nSo record your conversations with her whenever she asks you to babysit/do extra chores. Track how many times she asks, remind them of what chores you already do and that have other responsibilities like school work that need to take precedence before extra chores and childcare for stepsiblings.  And start locking your door to keep your siblings out.\n\nNTA but don't give up on standing up for yourself.", "I'm going with NTA in this. If you'd told anyone about your hiding spot, you'd have no way to get away from Josie. Since she's been emotionally manipulating you, and punishing you with extra chores, behind your father's back, and then lying about her actions to your father, she kinda deserves it.\n\nYou should not be put in the position of watching Josie's kids. You are not their parent, she is. She should not be piling additional chores on you to punish you for not relieving her of her parental responsibilities.\n\nYour phone should have a recording app built in, record your interactions with Josie so that you have proof of what she's doing, then play them for your dad.\n\nDo not disclose your hiding place.", "im going to say NTA bc the kids are josie's responsibility, not yours. it seems like she's pawning them off to you so she can do whatever she wants without having to worry about her kids, which is not right.\n\nIt is a little bit deceptive to lie about sneaking out, but imo you get a pass bc she's kind of infringing on your independence by trying to dump responsibility onto you", "Set up a hidden camera (with audio) in your room, on a day when you know your stepmother will act up. (Aim it so it won\u2019t record you dressing.)  Ask your dad out for coffee, and then show him the proof.

It will only get you in trouble. \n\nNTA", "NTA, since it was just once. BUT if hiding in an attic is your only way to get time for yourself, that's a long term problem and you might need to have a long conversation with your dad.", "Hahaha. This is hilarious. Smart girl. AH for lying and making her look crazy? Maybe a little bit but it's completely justified imo.", "NTA, this is great.", "I'm going with NTA here - as you said you already do chores, and you've been very clear with Josie that you do not want to watch her kids. She's refusing to accept your boundary and trying to steal all your free time. At this point she deserves what she gets.", "NTA at all. She's way out of line with this.  If it were me, I'd track all her requests in preparation for a full discussion with dad.\n\nAlso, you have taken \"hiding in my room\" to the next level. Props for that at least!", "So right now NTA because the adults are in the wrong for creating this situation. But this is NOT a long term solution. Maybe give your dad the truth. Show him your location and say \u201cI\u2019m home but I\u2019m hiding because I don\u2019t want to deal with step kids, and do extra chores. Why is she looking for me? She can text me\u201d\n\nEven take the next step and say \u201cI really don\u2019t want to sneak out or stay away all the time to get some privacy and independence and I\u2019m trying to handle this the right way. But I\u2019m running out of options\u201d \n\nGood luck this is a hard situation. But part of maturing is respectfully advocating for yourself, without taking no for an answer.", "As a step-mother, you are NTA. And this is kind of funny honestly - I would only feel bad for making her worry. Those children are not your responsibility and you should have a heart to heart with your dad. bonding is one thing. caring for/parenting is another. and you shouldn't be obligated, you are 16 and those are not your children.", "NTA. Also not the one responsible for her children \ud83d\ude43", "For your own good, don't do it again because they will find the extra room and then you are in big shit", "NTA because it sounds like your step-mom wants you to be a free babysitter and cleaning service, but you need to be VERY careful now. If you get caught making her look crazy, I have a feeling things will go South fast. Move your stuff out of the attic space and only take it up there when you\u2019re using it. That way, if you do get caught up there, it won\u2019t look like you spend a lot of time there before since there won\u2019t be a set up, and you can claim you JUST found it. Don\u2019t be careless with how you use the space, and I would suggest maybe not trying to make her look crazy again, because now she is thinking through how she\u2019s gonna catch you next time.\n\nAgain, NTA but I think your best course of action is to use the attic less, have an honest conversation with your dad, and maybe don\u2019t gaslight your step mom even if she isn\u2019t your favorite lol", "NTA\n\nJosie is too demanding.\n\nHowever, I would use that attic space as a safe hideaway for your stuff. I worry that if you hide there too often, it will be discovered and you will no longer be able to protect your things.\n\nJosie sounds like some bad bosses I\u2019ve had. What worked with them is keeping a record of what they ask of you. \n\nSo keep notes of all of Josie\u2019s requests for a couple of weeks and whether or not you did them.\n\nFor example:\n\nSaturday. Josie asked me to watch the boys for an hour so she could run to the store. I said yes. Josie was gone from 10 am to 2 pm.\n\nJosie told me to do the laundry and wash the kitchen floor. These chores took me three hours.\n\nSaturday total hours working for Josie: 7\n\nSunday. Josie asked me to watch the boys. I said no. Josie told me to do laundry, vacuum the downstairs and clean both bathrooms. Took 2 hours. Then did regular chores\u2014clean bedroom, did own laundry. 2 more hours.\n\nSunday total hours: 2 Josie hours plus 2 regular hours = 4 hours of chores.\n\nTotal for weekend= 11 hours.\n\nKeep records for at least two weeks of everything requested of you. Then go to your dad.\n\nJosie may say that she never asked all those things of you. You then need to have a discussion with your father as to why Josie is saying you are lying. Warn them both you will start recording everything Josie says to you on that case.", "NTA. You need to make it clear to Josie and your dad that just because you won't babysit doesn't mean you should get extra chores as a punishment. Remind them you're not built in child care for her. Also I don't know how cool your dad is but I would tell him that you have a secret space within the house that you like to use as it's yours and you need your alone time so he and Josie don't fight about it. You don't have to tell him where it is but let him know you have one. One day if this happens again then you'll look like the liar if she stands in your room on a video call while you're swearing that's where you are. Not worth it.", "NTA, you are not a built in babysitter. Hoping you can keep your secret space hidden for as long as possible. Also possibly record the events in some way so you can show your dad?", "NTA.\n\nYou're a smart kid who doesn't want to look after your step siblings or do anymore chores - nothing wrong with that. You shouldn't have to do one or the other.\n\nI'd come clean about the extra space to your dad and Josie, maybe they can get a lock on it or your room for you?", "NTA After all you weren't lying and if you ever tell them about that secret place be sure you'll lose your intimacy and a great place to be in when you need some time alone, even more when you stepbrother and stepsisters are so young. \n\nThis reminds me of the secret bathroom in brooklyn 99 tbh lmao", "NTA. I mean it was an asshole move, but you do what you need to do to take care of yourself.", "Good for you! They're not your responsibility. Don't use your secret too much, though. You might get found out and lose it forever! Seriously though, maybe yall could come to a compromise. Whenever i needed to babysit, I would always make sure to take the kids to another location. Ex Have your SM drop yall off at the park on alternating Saturdays for 2 hrs. That way it will at least put a bandaid on the situation.", "NTA, and \"gaslighting for good\".\n\nHad a friend that would climb out onto the roof outside his dormer window for similar reasons - not easy to find and people would leave him alone.", "Lol I love this. NTA", "NTA and a genius at that! Next record her interactions with you as proof and then your dad will see exactly who he married.", "NTA, you are a genius tho.\n\n just For safety concern, its not a hatch that locks right? id be worried in the case of a fire or other emergencies.", "This was legitimate comedy, and also, no you don\u2019t need to babysit children.

When I was telling his Mom he peed himself during a rage tantrum she got defensive and said: \"Well he has ADHD!\" and cried. No teenager is equipped to deal with these shenanigans, this is a job for professionals.", "NTA. Never tell them about the attic space. Resist the temptation. Keep it to yourself until you are moved out. Tell Josie that you were hiding under your bed because you didn\u2019t want to babysit and didn\u2019t know it would turn into a fight. Start keeping track/trying to record Josie\u2019s demands.", "NTA and I\u2019m laughing audibly because honestly, well done. Your family is probably going to find out about this secret nook, though, so you might consider telling your dad about it and letting him know that you\u2019ve been desperate to avoid babysitting when he isn\u2019t home. Beg him to talk to his wife about it. She is taking advantage of you when he isn\u2019t there and that isn\u2019t okay. It\u2019s easier for your dad to ignore the problem and say you\u2019re exaggerating because he isn\u2019t seeing it happen, so keep telling him. Every. Single. Time. As soon as it happens, text him \u201cYour wife is harassing me to babysit ever since you left,\u201d or whatever is happening. \n\nThe squeaky wheel gets the oil, so keep squeaking!", "Im a stepmom and I loathe other stepparents who give us a bad name. You are NTA, you're a child who has lost a parent, thrust into a family blend you didn't ask for, and deserve some compassion and grace.  \nI would suggest Telling your Dad whats going on but it may not be received well. You could also just explain to your stepmom how you feel but that might not go well either. None of it is your responsibility but at some point even though its unfair youll have to tell your dad whats going on or maybe you can get into therapy. It also sounds like your stepbrother could benefit from therapy and medication.... I hope your situation improves \\*hugs\\* for you though!", "Do not do this for a very long time.  Your stepmother could video call your father and show him, via the phone camera, your room is empty, the next time you try this.  She could also get your dad to call you. Your step mother would hear the phone ringing, or hear you talking to your father.\n\nKeep the place secret as long as possible. Just use it to hide important stuff.", "ESH.  Classic!  Unfortunately for you, it is only a matter of time until your hiding place is discovered and you (probably) lose access to it.  Then you'll be in the shit for deceiving your dad and lying to your step.   But your motivations are heartbreaking so you have my sympathy.   You have been thrown into a bad situation with an AH stepmother who is making your life miserable.", "ESH. Josie is being an AH by trying to take advantage of you. You\u2019re being an AH by playing mind games. I get that it\u2019s frustrating, but gaslighting and starting a a fight between your dad and the woman he loves is going to make the environment worse for everyone.\n\nI think the suggestion of recording her behavior and then flat out telling her she needs to stop lying to your dad about what she does is probably the best option. It\u2019s hard to have leverage when you\u2019re a kid, and I don\u2019t love suggesting blackmail, but at this point you can couple this with an honest assertion that you don\u2019t want to cause problems, but you\u2019re putting your foot down and she needs to accept it and handle her own kids. Tell her you\u2019ll delete the evidence once you see her change how she deals with you.", "NTA", "NTA", "YTA. But mildly so. Never nice to make people think they are going crazy or gaslighting them. \n\nBut your predicament is not nice either and I feel your father should be more understanding. I get his point about bonding with your step siblings, but the real issue here is the the way your step mother treats you. The three of you need a real sit down talk to hash out the expectations for everyone, including both parents in this situation.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA but in this case I can't say I blame you. Josie's kids are her responsibility, and you said you help around the house and have chores so it's not like you're doing nothing like you said. And the fact that she doesn't try to press you into helping when your dad is around is pretty telling. Try to record her on your phone next time, so you can tell your dad and have a conversation about it without her lying or trying to say you misunderstood. \n\nAnd *definitely* keep your hiding spot hidden.", "You're the mildest of AHs here--I can definitely see how the teenage brain came up with this solution and honestly it's funny af but this could land you in some big trouble. If there was a fire or any emergency, your parents really DO need to know about your location for family safety unfortunately. I definitely applaud your creativity because you've been put into an impossible situation. \n\nLook kiddo, this really sucks. Luckily you kind of hold all the cards because you have something Josie wants. You are perfectly within your rights to say \"I will provide 2 hours of help per month\" (or whatever amount of time you can stomach for family peace) on the condition that 1) my door has a lock on it and 2) my time boundaries are respected and I'm not asked to do any additional chores or babysitting. \n\nIf you don't think they'd abide by this, just keep saying no. No is a complete sentence. Josie can kick rocks.", "Just think about the consequence of your actions as your father will most likely find out what you did and trust will be broken.  There are other ways that you could show your dad how often she actually asks you to watch the kids or do more.", "This is JUSTIFIED asshole behavior.

Don't give up that secret spot no matter what you do.", "Nta", "Teenagers, I swear \ud83d\ude02 this is funny honestly. BUT as a responsible adult that I\u2019m supposed to be, I\u2019d say YTA for this bit lol but I understand not wanting to babysit. You shouldn\u2019t have to.

You are old enough to talk with your dad *and stepmom*, and make sure all of you are on the same page about the amount of responsibility expected from you.", "Yep.  Asshole move.\n\nI get where you're coming from, and I don't blame you.  But nut up and have a conversation about it like an adult.", "ESH. She doesn\u2019t treat you right, but being sneaky and underhanded in response isn\u2019t the way. They\u2019re going to figure it out and you\u2019ll be worse off for it.", "NTA. Your dad is playing a dangerous game and he will be surprised when you grow up and don\u2019t want to visit. Blending two bereaved families with kids wasn\u2019t a good idea. \n\nYou need a lock with a key on your bedroom door and be very clear to both of them why that is. \n\nI have kids with ADHD, it\u2019s like living in a zoo, they are wild and really, really hard work and yeah, stuff gets broken all the damned time. But they\u2019re MY kids and my responsibility. I wouldn\u2019t expect anybody to look after them except my husband. If close family offer then great but apart from that, no way. It\u2019s not fair on you at all.", "ESH.  That was a ah move.  She's also being an ah.  Try instead sending your dad a text with each new chore given.  Let him see exactly what you're dealing with instead of playing with people's heads.  Gaslighting like that is abusive behavior.  So is treating you like Cinderella/Cinderfella.", "YTA intentionally causing a fight between your dad and his wife is gross. So is lying about where you are. His wife is also responsible for you if your in her home. Plus he already has your back about babysitting - this wasn\u2019t necessary.", "YTA\n\nChores and shit is part of growing up. Attempting to sabotage a realtionship isn't acceptable in any capacity. This is a literal example of gaslighting.", "You aren't in the wrong for not wanting to babysit or do extra chores, but you are TA and would continue to be if you gaslight your SM and cause their marriage to fall apart. Refuse to babysit and do extra chores. Every time SM tries record her or call your dad and have him on the phone to answer SM every time. Talk to your guidance counselor at school. They can help you work through some stuff, point you in directions for additional help, and help get you out of a situation if you feel like you are being abused. Reach out to family, especially your mom's side, to advocate for you.", "You're almost an adult. Time to start acting like one. YTA.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA because you are a teen and because they basically forced your hand. I would have a serious talk with your dad about you being forced to hide from your stepmother and her kids (maybe don\u2019t say were you were hiding lol). Even if he isn\u2019t there to see it, the fact that you feel like hiding in your own home is worrying enough.", "OK this is pretty funny and I could totally see myself doing the same, but you're playing a dangerous game in that your dad might think you're doing something much worse and come down on you like a ton of bricks. NTA", "This is perfect, nta!", "NTA. \n\nwhile this is a good idea, this is only temporary and your dads wife might put a camera in your room to spy on you and prove to your dad your lying. \n\nYour going to need to go farther, and start recording all your interactions with your dads wife. Then email or text him the voice recordings immediately after, so that they can be claimed as fakes. \n\nEvery time he comes him, you need to follow up and ask him if you two can talk about rhe voice recordings, and how your not comfortable with the pressure his wife is putting on you to babysit or clean the house so she doesn't have to. \n\nYou need to let your dad know that his wife is trying to put her household and parental responsibilities onto you when you agreed with him that you wouldn't be required to babysit. \n\nYou need to let him know that you will do minimum chores and thats it and your not babysitting her kids. \n\nThat if she keeps pushing her responsibilities onto you, then your going to start spending more time outside of the house.", "NTA - those kids aren't your responsibility. That said you need to come clean about the attic crawl space before you are caught up there or climbing in/out of it.
