Not bc of religious beliefs or anything. It just never happened. When I find someone who I vibe with I can totally see myself having s\\*x. I'm also no prude. I watch p\\*rn like everyone else, love to read smut books and have no problem talking to my friends about their s'x lifes.\n\nMy friend group consists of 5 people that I'm really close to (2 guys 3 girls). We've known each other forever and they know that about me. I'm not keeping it a secret. Like I said no big deal.\n\nAll of us are at different stages of our life (uni, working, one girl is a sahm) but we try to meet each other weekly. Usually we met at cafes, to picnic, etc. but I recently moved into a bigger flat and it's getting colder so I offered to host them.\n\nSometimes there are also other people, not only us 5. Everyone can bring someone but all of us have to like them. Robert has been taking his uni friend H with him. No problem at all. H's roomate moved out and he's been feeling lonely. At first he seemed pretty nice. Even helped cleaning dishes after eating and brought some wine several times.\n\nThe topic of me and my love life came up. I've never dated anyone longterm yet and Sophie wanted to set me up . We laughed and talked about how the 1st date would be. Lauren jokingly said 'Don't have s\\*x after the 1st date, get to know him' I burst out laughing 'No problem, I've gone 22 years without it I won't jump him'. H reacted very weird to that. He practically screamed 'What? You're a virgin?'. Everyone was weirded out a bit by his outburst. I confirmed and shrugged. He turned quiet after that even though he usually talks. That was fine by me.\n\nHowever afterwards everytime we got together he made remarks about that. When I said something, no matter what he followed up with 'said the virgin'. Everytime we talked about s\\*x he said loudly 'You wouldn't understand that'. Even 'You have such big boobs I don't get how no one f'ed you yet' so on so on. It made me uncomfortable. The first few times I let it slide but then always told him it's not cool. After my Halloweenparty  where he made even more comments I pulled him aside to confront him. He said I shouldn't make a big deal out of it and he's just joking.\n\nWell, the core 5 group noticed it too. We chatted and they agreed with me. A few of them already talked to him about it but he brushed them off. Like I said I'm not ashmed of my v-card but felt very offended by him. So after Halloween I messaged him saying he wasn't welcomed at my place anymore and explained why.\n\nI got dozens of replies of him apologizing. He said he was sorry, that he was really into me and just surprised of me still being a v. That he didn't know how else to get my attention blah blah. I don't care, still insisted he shouldn't come over anymore. He practically begged and said he won't say that anymore, he's lonely and that I'm an ass for not letting him show he will change that.", "created_utc": 1667755283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynwdc9/aita_for_kicking_someone_out_bc_he_made_fun_of_my/", "score": 469, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
