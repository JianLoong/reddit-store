My brother (24M) got married a in March 2023, his wedding was small, with only family and some friends. at the end of the wedding he wanted a family photo, all of his side and his wife\u2019s side in the picture. \n\nWe went in height order and since I\u2019m quite short, I was placed at the front behind the kids. Now as I said, my scar is quite noticeable since is it dark purple and just before we were going to take the photo, my brother pulled me aside and asked if I could put some makeup on my scar to cover it. \n\nNow I\u2019m allergic to makeup, all kinds of makeup, no matter the brand, so it was an instant no, but my scar is very sensitive, I can\u2019t even put cream on it without it burning so I said no. \n\nI told him I will break out in a rash and will be in pain for the rest of the night for the sake of one picture. He said I just had to put on some foundation and take it off immediately after, I continued to say no and I wouldn\u2019t participate in the picture if I had to cover it. \n\nWe walked off and got his wife who offered to put the makeup on for me. I proceeded to tell her I\u2019m allergic to makeup and my scar will get irritated and inflamed but she insisted I put it on because I\u2019ll \u201cruin the photo\u201d \n\nI walked outside for some fresh air as I was getting very angry, my brother popped his head out a few minutes later and said they were going to take the picture. He then looked at my face and says I wasn\u2019t wearing makeup and told me to stay outside since I\u2019m not listening. \n\nI just left and went home. I of course got calls from family asking where I went but I just said I wasn\u2019t feeling well and had to go home \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683568080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bz7y9/aita_for_not_covering_a_scar_for_my_brothers/", "score": 585, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And even if you did put it on and immediately take it off afterwards, it could still potentially cause a rash. If they truly cared about you, they would never ask you to cover up a part of yourself, especially not for the sake of a single picture. Personally I would not lie and cover up for them, since I'm sure that if you told the people that asked why you left the real reason why they would stick up for you. If they didn't want you to \"ruin\" the picture so badly, then im sure that they care about their image an equal amount, and other people finding out that they tried to put you at risk just for a picture would definitely ruin their image.", "Nta if it bothers them that much there's this thing called photoshop.", "You're NTA, they shouldn't insist on you putting something you're allergic to on your skin.
