My brother (24M) got married a in March 2023, his wedding was small, with only family and some friends. at the end of the wedding he wanted a family photo, all of his side and his wife\u2019s side in the picture. \n\nWe went in height order and since I\u2019m quite short, I was placed at the front behind the kids. Now as I said, my scar is quite noticeable since is it dark purple and just before we were going to take the photo, my brother pulled me aside and asked if I could put some makeup on my scar to cover it. \n\nNow I\u2019m allergic to makeup, all kinds of makeup, no matter the brand, so it was an instant no, but my scar is very sensitive, I can\u2019t even put cream on it without it burning so I said no. \n\nI told him I will break out in a rash and will be in pain for the rest of the night for the sake of one picture. He said I just had to put on some foundation and take it off immediately after, I continued to say no and I wouldn\u2019t participate in the picture if I had to cover it. \n\nWe walked off and got his wife who offered to put the makeup on for me. I proceeded to tell her I\u2019m allergic to makeup and my scar will get irritated and inflamed but she insisted I put it on because I\u2019ll \u201cruin the photo\u201d \n\nI walked outside for some fresh air as I was getting very angry, my brother popped his head out a few minutes later and said they were going to take the picture. He then looked at my face and says I wasn\u2019t wearing makeup and told me to stay outside since I\u2019m not listening. \n\nI just left and went home. I of course got calls from family asking where I went but I just said I wasn\u2019t feeling well and had to go home \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683568080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bz7y9/aita_for_not_covering_a_scar_for_my_brothers/", "score": 1288, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And even if you did put it on and immediately take it off afterwards, it could still potentially cause a rash. If they truly cared about you, they would never ask you to cover up a part of yourself, especially not for the sake of a single picture. Personally I would not lie and cover up for them, since I'm sure that if you told the people that asked why you left the real reason why they would stick up for you. If they didn't want you to \"ruin\" the picture so badly, then im sure that they care about their image an equal amount, and other people finding out that they tried to put you at risk just for a picture would definitely ruin their image.", "Nta if it bothers them that much there's this thing called photoshop.", "You're NTA, they shouldn't insist on you putting something you're allergic to on your skin.

For my own health and safety i went home \"", "This is fantastic provided OP is more gracious than I am and doesn't cut them out of her life!", "This is the way.", "Yeah, that reminds me of a recent post where the OOP took either wedding or engagement party photos for her cousin. The cousin and husband asked OOP to Photoshop his sister's wheelchair into a regular chair or if it wasn't possible to just delete the sister from the photo. OOP asked if the sister knew about this or approved it, they said no so OOP understandably refused. The cousin threw a hissy fit.", "You had me a DECAF to start your day.\n\nYes, I agree.  People need to chill.", "Our school photos just used to airbrush out flaws as \"needed\" until a kid with a huge mole under his lip had his mom complain which escalated. \n\nSo my last year and im.assuming going further we had to circle things we wanted airbrushed on the watermarked photo and they would do it for the final you purchase. \n\nWell another students dad ended up.getting escorted out in a fit of rage. Turns out he had a nice side hustle of photoshopping the water marks off the photos for parents for cheaper than paying for the pictures. \n\nSo much drama over shit pictures. I imagine the company is happy now that they spend less on shopping photos that dont get purchased and a better incentive to pay for an edited one.", "It takes skill to cover a scar with makeup. Just patting on some foundation won't do it, even if it's a matching shade (and OP wasn't allergic). Unless the bride happens to be a professional makeup artist, she wouldn't be able to cover the scar with foundation.", "You're NTA and honestly I applaud you for not creating any drama on the day by saying you went home cause you weren't feeling well.\n\nBUT!  If your family is going to side with your brother anyway, I'd tell them the truth now that the 'Day' is over.\n\nAnd every time that family photo is shown and if people ask why you're not in it I'd tell them the truth, that you're brother and SIL din't want you in the photo because of your injury.", "That's a damn good reason, too.  You soon will be at university or a fulltime job, and you'll decide how much contact you really want with family.\n\nYou are strong and I wish you the best in your adult life.", "That is totally understandable. It doesn't make it any better, but your brother was only thinking about trying to make his pictures perfect. One day it will hit him in the gut how it made you feel. Trouble is, when that happens, it will probably go one of two ways. Either you'll be out of order for not complying or he will apologise. But don't you feel bad about this. You have had to learn to live with it, and so does he.\n\nIt does get easier my dear, one day you'll realise you haven't thought about it in a while and the new friends you make don't care. It is ppl who knew you before don't know how to deal with it or talk about it. I bet it made you feel emotional sharing this. I know it's hard but you got this. Well done for standing up for yourself xxx\n\nEdit: ps; I found 'bio oil' to be good for scars. It can help the scar to go silvery after a while but it also keeps the skin around the scar supple. It helps that pulling/burning sensation you can get when you've had a long day and it is pulling", "Then your whole family are a-holes. I\u2019m sorry none of them have even a little bit of empathy to understand that you should not have to go through literal pain just to fit your brother and his brides fantasies. If I were you I\u2019d reiterate to them that if they did manipulate you to wear makeup, that\u2019s literally abuse and a crime. And if they still don\u2019t get it then I\u2019d consider distancing myself from such idiots.", "I\u2019m indignant for you, for whatever that\u2019s worth.\n\nAlso, if your friend\u2019s then-boyfriend\u2019s reaction to your calling him a bad boyfriend was to do what he did, I think your assessment was spot on.", "Wait are your parents standing behind him knowing the whole medical side of the scar!?", "I really, really hope you reported your assailant to the police, and they charged him with an offense. And depending on how old you were when this happened, and the fact that you're only 18 now, it may be that if there's a record of this you can still sue the boy civilly for your injury. If you can, maybe you should. Not for the cost of scar revision or anything like that, but when someone injures a person like this awful boy injured you there should be severe consequences. Calling someone a prick for cheating does NOT excuse, in any way, a physical assault. And NTA for refusing to put on makeup. Your family is awful.", "Context matters. If OP had been a bully and had a history of poor behaviour, then it could impact on how the reader views the AITA post. Could have been an unreliable narrative. Also, if family had caused it and it was a source of guilt for the family member, that could have provided some context. It wasn\u2019t meant to provoke. I\u2019ve known some people that hate the reminder of what some scars represent. \n\nThis was not the case here. OP was rightfully defending their friend.", "Specially with the allergy. And the wife with the make up ready to be applied! What a couple of jerks", "Agreed. \n\nWhat if OP had lost her arm in an accident?   NO photos ever!!  Live forever alone in some garret or attic!\n\nScars happen in life, whether physical or emotional, and not everything can be covered up.  NOR should it be assumed that scars SHOULD be covered up.", "I love you so much for this", "Bless you for the BSG reference.", "So say we all!", "Nope. Generally people are there to witness your marriage ceremony. They'll remember Uncle Cedric getting drunk and dropping trou, but nobody will remember a leaning cake! :)", "100%", "Cruel and unusual!", "They would rlly rather have a picture where he\u2019s breaking out in hives over a small scar that can be edited out, as if hives are a cute look for a weddint", "I was thinking this too. It takes complicated make up to cover up a truly dark scar.", "And when people would look at them, they'd wonder why OP's distinctive scar is missing because (facial) scars become how people recognise you.", "Yup. They know how the scar was caused and how it was out of my control but they still stand behind the fact that my scar is ugly and shouldn\u2019t be on show", "Does it matter tho? What if op lost an arm and didn't wear a prosthetic? What about an eye?\n\nWhat if it was something insanely traumatic?", "Wait till the families see the pictures and start questioning why is she nowhere to be found, that's a perfect opportunity to explain it (at least in my country usually the newlyweds invite the family to show the pictures)", "I'm honestly shocked OP's brother isn't whining about it to everyone and having other family members blow up her phone for being \"selfish\". OP's time will come. Bro and wife won't be able to hold it in forever.", "This would be me.\nGetting married is (usually) a once in a lifetime thing.\nFamily are supposed to be understanding, lovable and wonderful.\n\nBut for OP's own brother to be saying \"Your face doesn't mix with our wedding aesthetic\"\nIs not only rude, but it's confidence shattering and being made to feel uncomfortable at an event EVERYONE should be celebrating...\nRegardless of skin.\n\nUgh!", " am betting wifey was behind it.", "Even without the allergy. \n\nHe asked. OP said no. That should be the end of it. \n\nEven if Photoshop didn\u2019t exist, that should be the end of it.", "I actually love rain so I didn't care.  Some others that attended kept telling me how horrible it was that it was raining.  \n\nThe only thing that I wanted to make the day awesome (aside from the obvious)  was my cinnamon ice cream....and I didn't get it because I was greeting guests and someone else ate mine. The day was still awesome.", "Them: \"Cover up that scar! People will stare.\"\n\nMe:  Puts on eye patch. \"Done.\"", "Not saying it would be right or wrong, just that it would provide context. Obviously, OP is NTA. I was just trying to understand what could possibly motivate their family to behave in such a way. It was more curiosity than anything else. OP was happy to provide context.", "Who even looks at wedding photos anyway? You look at them once or twice then nothing for how many years.\nNTA", "Isn't it funny how some people will do anything to bring someone else down? You're having the time of your life and Debbie Downer is just like \"womp womp it's raining though.\" Go have some cinnamon ice cream with your love.", "I _love_ cinnamon ice cream! Sorry you missed yours that day!", "That is excellent advice for all of us, not just OP.", "I think it also applies to all drugs, not just booze."]}
