My brother (24M) got married a in March 2023, his wedding was small, with only family and some friends. at the end of the wedding he wanted a family photo, all of his side and his wife\u2019s side in the picture. \n\nWe went in height order and since I\u2019m quite short, I was placed at the front behind the kids. Now as I said, my scar is quite noticeable since is it dark purple and just before we were going to take the photo, my brother pulled me aside and asked if I could put some makeup on my scar to cover it. \n\nNow I\u2019m allergic to makeup, all kinds of makeup, no matter the brand, so it was an instant no, but my scar is very sensitive, I can\u2019t even put cream on it without it burning so I said no. \n\nI told him I will break out in a rash and will be in pain for the rest of the night for the sake of one picture. He said I just had to put on some foundation and take it off immediately after, I continued to say no and I wouldn\u2019t participate in the picture if I had to cover it. \n\nWe walked off and got his wife who offered to put the makeup on for me. I proceeded to tell her I\u2019m allergic to makeup and my scar will get irritated and inflamed but she insisted I put it on because I\u2019ll \u201cruin the photo\u201d \n\nI walked outside for some fresh air as I was getting very angry, my brother popped his head out a few minutes later and said they were going to take the picture. He then looked at my face and says I wasn\u2019t wearing makeup and told me to stay outside since I\u2019m not listening. \n\nI just left and went home. I of course got calls from family asking where I went but I just said I wasn\u2019t feeling well and had to go home \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683568080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bz7y9/aita_for_not_covering_a_scar_for_my_brothers/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And even if you did put it on and immediately take it off afterwards, it could still potentially cause a rash. If they truly cared about you, they would never ask you to cover up a part of yourself, especially not for the sake of a single picture. Personally I would not lie and cover up for them, since I'm sure that if you told the people that asked why you left the real reason why they would stick up for you. If they didn't want you to \"ruin\" the picture so badly, then im sure that they care about their image an equal amount, and other people finding out that they tried to put you at risk just for a picture would definitely ruin their image.", "Nta if it bothers them that much there's this thing called photoshop.", "You're NTA, they shouldn't insist on you putting something you're allergic to on your skin.

He smacked my head off a table which is how the scar came about", "Also\u2026fuck the person that gave you the scar!", "My limo driver had to call the police during our photos because a homeless guy kept trying to steal everyone's jewelry...off their body.  And it rained all day.  And my mom almost didn't show up because her ex boyfriend went to the hospital (he was fine, but she didn't know that then), she was the ONLY member of my family in attendance.\n\nI really wish people would remember that yes, you're dropping a lot of cash into this day, but it's about the marriage not the wedding.  And that perfection doesn't actually exist.", "Exactly this like wth, its your family, who cares how the photo turns out? Its a picture of loved ones!", "What cracks me up is that these people think that ANYONE is going to be interested in the wedding pictures after maybe the 1st year. So they're going to hurt a loved one for a picture nobody else cares about & they probably won't either after a while. Heck, I haven't looked at my wedding pictures in over 30 years (married for 34).", "People want the perfect wedding photo to pretend their life is perfect and to say that anyone who isn\u2019t perfect (or subservient) doesn\u2019t belong in their family. Basically they want to play make believe", "F 'em. Find a new family, that one's rotten.", "I have a family like this. It will never get better.", "Your brother certainly won't be the one asked to look after them when they get old and frail. Say no and have fun picking the nursing home they go to.\n\nActions have consequences, especially when you play favorites. \n\nMove far away, a good family isn't always blood", "True,  but if someone doesn't care that makeup will make someone sick,   they probably aren't going to care if photoshopping someone makes them upset", "Hmm, so no reason for brother to be personally upset by seeing it.  Yeah, he should have just spoken to the photographer about editing it out if he really couldn\u2019t stand it \u201cruining\u201d his perfect picture.", "I agree. The photo could've easily been edited. Your brother will grow up (as in mature) and regret his superficial decision. This is just ridiculous that they were so bothered by a scar. Who cares?\n\nThis is not your fault. Your brother is the AH, and so is your family for not sticking up for you. Sorry that your brother is the \"golden child.\" \n\nNTA", "Haha it was a kid who smacked my head off a metal table cuz I said he\u2019s a bad boyfriend. My friend kicked him in the balls for it", "Yeah, all my life they\u2019ve taken my brothers side so I just kinda chill in the background. As long as I\u2019ve got vodka and my phone I don\u2019t rlly care", "100%.", "Good. I hope it hurt like hell!", "I hope your friend kicked his balls hard enough to send them back up through his spine or at the very least left him entirely unable to breed.", "Omg! 100% NTA, that is such an unreasonable request of you, your allergic plus it\u2019s just rude to ask someone to hide their scars. I\u2019m so sorry you went through that OP, your brother should have known better to ask a request like that from you.", "Drinking vodka w friends is far more fun ;)"]}
