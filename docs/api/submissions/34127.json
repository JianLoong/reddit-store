You made assumptions that fit what you wanted, rather than listening to her words that she wanted a break. Sounds like you pushed her away permanently with your lack of boundary respect.

I can see where you\u2019re coming from but you probably should have given her more space during the break. However she\u2019s also an adult and fully capable of saying no and telling you she doesn\u2019t want to hangout with you when you bring it up. I do think it was childish of her to agree to dinner then cancel and say she\u2019s totally booked for the rest of the week (granted something could have come up but going off what\u2019s written I doubt it) and then blowing up on you via text after you backed off about breakfast and let her have the space and time she actually asked you for in that moment.\n\nMy advice would be to just let her be and try to move on. She may come back after a while but I would advise that before you think of taking her back you have a serious conversation about this series of events and how you both viewed the situation. If she doesn\u2019t then let her go and move on.", "You were YTA before this when you thought her problems are not \u201cbig\u201d. News Flash Dude, someone else\u2019s \u201cBig\u201d is NOT YOUR \u201cBig\u201d and that is OK. I highly recommend you get over yourself, ASAP, because if this is how you deal with problems with a Partner, you will not end up having one. I Promise you that.", "ESH but it doesn't sound like you two are compatible. Telling her how to dress is gross and controlling. \n\nA relationship can't focus on one party which seems like what you both want; you focus on yourself and she thinks everything should focus on her. No. \n\nI would just assume you're broken up gor good", "NAH. You clearly still want her only she doesn\u2019t want you and even though it hurts, that\u2019s just how it is. Just put it behind you and try to move on. Who knows she might be talking to someone else and is trying to see how it goes in the meanwhile.", "NAH\n\n  \n\"She then said we shouldn\u2019t hang out again until after the holidays in January.\u00a0\" ... She wanted her fuckparties not interupted by your calls, and she made that clear. She wanted guiltfree vacation from the relationship. \n\n\"and even hang out on occasion\" .. A good way to compare, but she is fine not to want that to be to tedious. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can respect that - it's a break, after all - or you can change the break into a break up. If you did not like it, why did you agree?\n\n \n\n  \n\"Now today is January first and she won\u2019t respond to my text and has removed pictures of me from Instagram\" .. So take the hint. She tried out opther options while keeping you as a backup plan, and now she has decided she likes some other option more. That's the nature of a break, after all: Time to decide if the relationship is worth continuing or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\"(but she also posted a new years collage, which includes a few pictures of me and screenshots of cute texts I\u2019ve sent her through the year).\" ..
