{"id": 28242, "submission_id": "1708t52", "title": "AITA For Having A Baby With The Same Man My Cousin Adored Before She Married My Ex?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account because too many people know my main. And, yes, the story is just as crazy as the title suggests.\n\nI (32f) have a cousin \"Mia\" (32f) through my maternal size and while we were never besties I considered us on good terms. We got a little closer when my mom, stepdad, siblings and I moved to the same city my cousin and her parents were in high school. She'd show me around and invite me to group activities that she was at, which I really appreciated but our personalities were just too different for us to consistently hang out together.\n\nDuring the summers of my high school life I would go spend it with my dad and coincidentally a guy named \"Gene\" (33m) would spend his summers with his aunt who's house was right next door to Mia's. Mia had the hots for him instantly but from how she would whine on about never getting him to date her, I could tell he wasn't interested. I'd never seen him in person as a teenager but Mia had pictures and I agreed he was definitely a good looking guy and the fact that he lived in another country and had a cute accent made him all the more attractive in Mia's eyes. \n\nDespite wanting Gene, Mia would go on dates with other guys which I didn't begrudge her but I did take exception when she was seen making out with my boyfriend at a party. Mia claimed that it was an accident brought on by the alcohol and just as I was starting to forgive her Mia revealed she was pregnant and my ex was the father. That sealed the deal for me and outside of big family events I didn't see Mia at all. Mia and my ex's parents pressured them to marry before the baby was born and I did not attend the wedding despite my family's pleas/demands. It was honestly one of the reasons why I moved in with my dad, his wife, and other siblings during college. After college I got a job at a company that was doing business with a company that Gene was at and we officially met there. Gene recognized me as Mia's cousin and had a \"what a small world\" type of reaction. \n\nI had to explain to Gene that Mia and I \"drifted apart\" and he stopped bringing her up. After that we had a semi-causal relationship and I did genuinely find him charming. It wasn't until after I left the company and got a new job that Gene asked me out and I agreed. When we started to get more serious I got more detailed about what went down with me and Mia, and Gene confessed that he was aware of her crush he wasn't interested and just played dumb instead of being straight forward. \n\nFast forward to now and I am 5 months pregnant. Gene is the father and I recently made a post with a pic of us together and that's how Mia found out. I have been getting calls and texts from Mia, her mom, a few of her friends stating that I am TA for not reaching out to Mia and giving her a heads up at the very least. I knew that Mia might feel some type of way about this, but I honestly didn't care. However, she's apparently devastated so AITA?

Congratulations by the way! \nBlock her and everyone who supports her.", "NTA She had a crush he wasn't attracted to her. She's married now to your ex. You should remind your family of these facts.", "This cannot be real. If, however it is, I hear banjoes playing in my ears.", "So a cousing with cartoonish levels of selfishness and lack of introspection get irate at OP doing something that's not scorning at all?  Good effort OP but best to keep writing as a past time.", "NTA!!  Karma!  Good luck OP!", "HA, NTA in any way", "Excuse me? Why the heads up for Mia? Gene is not her ex. Did she give you a heads up when she spread her legs for your ex? What a toxic family. NTA.", "NTA OP \n\nOh how wonderful karma is. It doesn't even compare to what she did to you in the slightest. Gene was never interested in her nor did they ever date. Your aunt and cousin seem like the type that it's always I can do this to you but you can't ever do the same to me. Definitely the kind of people that would turn up to a wedding in white to be spiteful. \n\nBlock them and the flying monkeys and enjoy the rest of your life with your little family in peace. They aren't worth a grain of your time nor energy", "\u201cDear flying monkeys, Mia didn\u2019t give me a heads up that she was being impregnated by my boyfriend, I feel no obligation to her, back off\u201d", "[removed]", "NTA", "NTA she\u2019s salty seeing you get someone she wanted while she was forced to marry someone because of her pregnancy.", "NTA", "I wonder how her husband feels about her \u201cdevastation?\u201d \n\n\u201cMaybe if she hadn\u2019t screwed my boyfriend she would\u2019ve had a chance with Gene? Hahahahaha, no just kidding, he told me he was never interested in her.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think you owe any of them any kind of explanation, but it you feel compelled to offer one, make it really work for you. None of those people who are reaching out on Mia\u2019s behalf deserve any kind of response or reaction from you. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all - \n\nSO you are not \"allowed\" to live the life you choose but your cousin was \"allowed\" to marry and have a child with the guy you were in a relationship with. What heads up?! Fate got her good. And apparently her husband as well, that he is now stuck with her. You don't need Mia or her mom or her friends to approve your story. Tells a lot about how she was raised. \n\nOP, maybe reply with \"You are defending a teenage crush of a married woman with a child from a partner who used to be my boyfriend when Mia hooked up with him. She wanted a heads up for what, karma?\"", "NTA - Mia should get a grip. Been given a mouthful of her own medicine", "NTA Mias life is ducked bc she had fun for five minutes when she was a teenager so ofc she\u2019s jealous but she\u2019s also the bitch that fucked your boyfriend so no, you don\u2019t own her anything.", "Info: how did Mia's husband take the news?", "I mean, you\u2019re in your 30s and it is kinda crazy she is pissy about a high school crush::.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. She's a married woman with a husband and a kid. Why would she care about some other guy? Especially when she was (and is) nothing for that guy.", "She got what she gave.", "NTA. Is Mia under the impression that having a crush on someone is the same as dating them? Because she didn\u2019t date your current bf. But she did marry and have a baby with your ex bf, a man you were actually dating. Those things just aren\u2019t the same. In getting together with a man she crushed on and hasn\u2019t seen in, what, 15ish years, you haven\u2019t done anything wrong. But Mia needs to do some serious self-reflection.", "NTA. Sounds like a Hallmark movie!", "NTA. This women had a major crush on someone who didn\u2019t like her back, got pregnant by and married your ex, without even considering your feelings. Now she wants to act like this is betrayal? No. Mia and Gene never dated, hooked up, nothing. You had to reason to tell her outside of the fact that she\u2019s family (and I don\u2019t subscribe to the \u201cfamily is family\u201d nonsense, if they\u2019re toxic cut them off). You live your life, you did nothing wrong here", "Mia doesn\u2019t get to play victim, NTA.", "NTA both you and gene are grown adults capable of making your own decisions. Neither of you had a relationship with Mia at the point of getting together. Mia made her choices and now has to live with them. Neither you or gene owe her or her family anything", "NTA.  She had a crush on the guy and he didn't feel the same way about her.  Mia never had a relationship with Gene, and even if she did, you didn't owe her any kind of conversation.  She'll have to get over her devastation by focusing on the family she formed with your ex.", "NTA\n\nShe lot all rights to know what's happening in your life when she slept with your boyfriend", "NTA Mia moved on and is married to another man, plus Gene was never interested in her. She can be salty if she wants, I guess, but those feelings aren't your fault or your problem.", "NTA So Mia still has not got over an unrequited crush 15 years later? She needs therapy. Seriously.\n\nIn other news what kind of small town do you all live in where people are partner swapping like this??", "The best thing about this is that none of what you did was for the wrong reasons - revenge, spite etc.  It was just a coincidence that you met Gene, and from there it was all organic. \n\nMia can fuck off.  The fact that she is even remotely upset at you for this, after what she did to you, is crazy.  You didn\u2019t even do anything to her here. And if she is upset, that is her problem for her to resolve on her own. You owe her nothing, not even a heads up.\n\nNTA.  And congratulations!", "Nta ofc... She got the same heads up as she gave you...", "How did Gene recognize you when you\u2019d only ever seen a picture of him?", "NTA\n\nWhy would she be worried about her former crush having a family with you when she married/impregnated by your ex while you were still with him?", "If you don\u2019t call out the irony and point out the entitlement of her, her mother, and her friend and tell them to all shove it. I cannot believe they think they have the right to say anything to you at all and the Gaul Mia has right now to me \u201c devastated \u201c is sicking I pray you tell her exactly what I said and that she should focus on her husband that she stole!", "Why would you think she cared about a guy she had a crush on half a lifetime ago? Especially since she's married and shown in the past that she doesn't give a shit about other people's relationships? \n\nShe's \"devastated\" about you getting the guy who never wanted her and who she hasn't seen in over a decade? That's not a you problem. That's an embarrassing indication that she's deeply unhappy with her life choices. Sucks to suck. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA.  You owe her nothing.  \n\nDid I read this right?  She is married to and has a baby by your ex.  Yes.  You were supposed to be all happy and go to her wedding.\n\nNow, your are with Gene, her ex and she is having a snit fit.  Mia has no business feeling anything about this.  \n\nYou owe nothing to Mia, her mother or her wacky friends.  Gene is off the market, so to speak.  Mia is a married woman and a mother and should not be shopping.", "Sounds a lot like in-breeding", "NTa- she burnt that bridge of forethought a long time ago. You owe her nothing!", "Country roads. Take me homeeee", "NTA. Youre allowed to live your own life and youre doing nothing wrong. The only reason she would be upset you were pregnant with genes child is if she still wanted him. There is no other explanation. \n\n She is a \"I want what she cant have\" type of person. Weak sauce.", "I missed the part where Mia gave you a heads up that she was going to bang your BF. NTA I hope your Ex is saut\u00e9ing in envy that his wife is oh so devastated that she didn't hook someone else.", "NTA. Your cousin needs to get over herself. If anything, this is karma getting her. You don\u2019t owe her, or anyone, an explanation. Enjoy your life and ignore the cry babies.", "Reading the headline I was primed for a negative response, reading the whole thing, NTA.  Are we related?  this sounds like something that would happen in my family.", "NTA oh please Mia is being silly and just wants to reverse some of the blame she's received. Block her and others not worth your time. Congrats on the baby", "NTA. \n\nOh, and I do love how Karma played this one out. Very well played indeed. \n\nCongratulations and happy gestating.", "NTA Ask why on earth should you give (Ex\u2018s name)\u2018s wife a heads up about who you\u2019re dating? Why do they think you owe her anything?", "Mia lost her rights at normal interactions when she kissed, screwed, got married to, and had a baby with your ex.\n\nNtA", "NTA first your partner isn't interested in her. Second she is MARRIED WITH A KID! Is she still pining after your partner or something? I wonder how your ex would take this? Does he know? Sounds like divine intervention did you a solid in this beautiful petty revenge.", "NTA\n\nYou should send them a message back saying \"Oh sorry I didn't give you a heads up! Since Mia didn't give me one when she **started kissing my then boyfriend!!!** Toodles\"", "NTA go live your happy life with Gene and stay NC and block Mia and her gang you deserve happiness she married your ex after cheating with him so Karma bites \ud83d\ude02", "NTA- Several things, Mia is married and with child with your ex. So why she tripping is crazy. And lastly, Gene stated he knew Mia liked him but he wasn\u2019t interested in her. So she couldn\u2019t have Gene anyway.  She\u2019s stuck with your second sloppy and tired down with a baby from a man apparently she doesn\u2019t love. Karma is something else.", "Heads up??? She had sex with ur bf and married him to have his kid, did she have u heads up when she was getting plowed??? Nope. So she doesn\u2019t deserve anything from u not even a moment of ur life.

Did she give you heads up before she jumped down your boyfriends throat?", "Screw that she's married with a child at least and NEVER DATED Gene. NTA op", "NTA. I mean honestly even without the previous drama, she\u2019s already married.", "I had the same exact reaction. Did Mia give OP a heads up when when she slept with her boyfriend?
