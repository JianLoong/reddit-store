But hopefully you circled back and told her so she could make other plans / purchase.", "NTA. You didn't sign a contract with her, you didn't even put a plan into place about where and when she'd pick them up. I've had plenty of people get that far when buying stuff from me and then disappear. \n\nAs long as you tell her before she drives somewhere to pick the up or something, you are good.", "YTA. You told her yes. People acting like this is why market places online suck. You never know if the seller is going to stick to the agreement.", "NTA - you took the best offer. She should have paid you and picked them up right away. She waited.", "NAH - leaning towards possible YTA.  \n\nYou are clearly new to market place type deals.  One of my greatest frustrations when I had my brain aneurysm surgeries was I was having to make and sell furniture while I went to my appointments and recovered.  \n\nI enjoyed woodworking and most of my deals went smooth.  \n\nHowever......I posted all the specifics online.  Measurements, type of finish, weight, and if it could be disassemble such as the tables and so on.  \n\nI specified first come, first serve, no holds.", "Soft YTA. If you made an agreement, you should have (a) given the lady a chance to pick up the tires within a certain time (since you already said \"yes\" to her) or they'd be sold, or (b) told the guy that if she didn't pick them up, he had \"next\" on the tires.\n\nThis behavior gives online selling a bad name. You're not \"going straight to hell\" TA here, but \"a bit shitty\" TA. Don't lose sleep over it, and be better next time.", "YTA. That's kind of a dick move, dude. You should have told him he could get them if she bailed on the sale.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
