I(20m) would eat lunch with my friend(20f) and a few other friends nearly every week day. Basic college cafeteria food. Every time my friend would take some off my plate. Which I don't mind. It's shitty college cafeteria food and I'm on a meal plan.\n\nOne time I ordered a little extra fries and tenders. When she finished her meal and started reaching over for mine. I just slid the extra portion over to her. I genuinely don't see how this could be seen as malicious. I was just thinking \"she will eat it anyway so why not?\" and that was literally the end of my thought process. Thought it'd be a nice thing and I was a bit hungry that day because I had to skip breakfast so I thought it'd be a win win.\n\nShe looked at the extra food with disgust and said \"what is this?\" I said. I ordered it for you. She said \"what you think I need more food?\" I just told her that since she usually takes some of mine I would just get her a side portion of her own. I explained about how usually I don't care but I was a hungry that day. She was like \"what you think I always take your food?\" I said \"every time we eat together you take some\" and I explained that I don't care and just tried to move on with this. I asked a friend about his product or something(don't really remember) She got really pissed like \"oh so you keep track of when I take your food?\" I said no and that I just thought it would be a nice thing and a win win for the both of us.\n\nShe went on about how I was thinking ahead and how I must have been sick of her eating my food. She said how she doesn't need to eat less food. She is not overweight or anything so I'm genuinely confused as to how it got to that point. She is generally a calm friendly person I get along with and talk to frequently and the day after that it went back to normal. Just really lost. I didn't even think about the things or situations she brought up. I was just like \"hungry today, order her more so I can eat more, win win\" and that was the end of my thought process", "created_utc": 1686974264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bgpkh/aita_ordering_extra_food_for_friend_bc_she/", "score": 547, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You tried to do a good deed, and she got embarrassed.", "NTA she\u2019s only upset because even though you don\u2019t care it is quite rude to take food off your plate every time you eat together and she knows that.", "Well, that would be the *last* damn time she got even one french fry from me. \n\nOP, eat your own food.  The food  stealing and in denial over who knows what person can get her own nibbles from now on.\n\nOP, you got her extra food because you *knew* she would take some of yours. That was really nice of you. She insulted you and made a scene. NTA", "NTA. But even if you were simply sick of her eating your food that would be totally reasonable and like\u2026 valid. Sounds like she\u2019s defensive for some reason. But either way it\u2019s wild that she thinks she\u2019s entitled to your food.", "What if you DO notice when she eats your food? That behavior is more normal for some than others, and it's a bit odd that she wants to take your food and also blame you if you notice and remember it.\n\nThis is about her, not you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You were generous enough to buy her extra food and she acted like a total assh*le. Taking food of somebody plate is very rude. I would chop her arm if I were you. Nobody mess with my food.", "NTA \n\nNo ambivalence. She keeps taking your food.\nYou ordered more food because you are hungry.\n\nShe\u2019s angry because she knows it\u2019s rude and she was caught for it. Maybe she thought her taking your food is unnoticed?", "NTA- she is tripping. She takes your food all the time, and then when you buy extra just for her, she gets mad and starts making wild accusations over you giving her food. I would not let her take another piece of food off your plate again whether you care or not. Her behavior is unacceptable and rude.", "NTA. I don't think you did anything wrong, and it sounds like she is very self-conscious over how much she eats for some reason. There could also be a little bit of guilt that she's always taking your food that is causing some defensiveness too", "NTA. She basically got a mirror in her face on something that triggers her shame. You poked a bear you didn't know was inside her. Shame around food and eating and body image, I'm guessing. Hopefully she'll drop it and you guys can just move on like normal.", "She sounds unhinged \u2620\ufe0f NTA", "NTA  \nStraight and simple.  \nShe normally takes some, so you bought extra. Nothing wrong with assuming she was gonna take some sense she normally does and you needed the portion you wanted to eat.", "NTA. I think she was embarrassed more than anything and didn\u2019t know how to react. You had the perfect idea of buying more food vs. waiting to tell her she couldn\u2019t have yours. Proactive solution to a known situation.", "NTA. she enjoys taking food from you. she isnt hungry...she just likes depriving you of food that you want to eat", "NTA but as others have said it seems like she might be going through body image issues, which is not a fun time.", "NTA\n\nShe got embarrassed, she got defensive, she went on the attack. You\u2019re clear.", "NTA\u2014that was thoughtful of you. \n\nIt sucks though\u2014it sounds like she\u2019s having issues with her body image\u2014and thats super painful. not in any way your fault, but it sucks for her.  If you can find it in you to be kind to her about it, i'm sure it would mean a lot even if she is being difficult and unreasonable right now", "NTA. So, this is one of two things: either she really likes you and you just embarrassed her (next time ask her out) OR she is an entitled AH and you correctly marked a boundary.", "NTA. How are you supposed to not keep tabs on a random hand continuously rummaging around on your plate?", "NTA. She had to do some really weird mental gymnastics to get from receiving your extra portion to \"I don't need to eat less food\". I mean that doesn't even make sense.", "NTA. Stop letting her take from your plate. Its rude and not your problem to begin with. And the way she reacted is awful. \n\nI was a nice girl in high school and used to buy extra food for a friend who never had money in their account. One day I didn't, I just got my chicken nuggets and mashed potatoes. They kept reaching over and touching MY food, even after I asked them to stop. FIVE TIMES, ALL FIVE CHICKEN NUGGETS. So I stabbed them in the hand with my fork. It didn't break the skin, but we both learned an important lesson.\n\n\n Be kind but do not let people eat food off your plate without offering. Even dates reaching out for extra fries. Be like Joey on Friends and never apologize for it.", "NTA, it sounds like she was doing trying to flirt with you (do that \"cute\" thing of steeling your food so you talk to her). Think a girls version of pulling pigtails, and by you getting her extra food you pointed out that it wasn't cute and you didn't think of it as flirting.", "NTA\n\nYou were trying to do something nice but also ensure that you had a full meal.  She doesn't like being called on her behaviour.  It could just be embarrassment or you were just never meant to say anything and let her get away with it (for whatever reason she's made up in her head).", "NTA.\n\nShe wants to live in a little fantasy of her own where she's not eating off of your plate.  If it were me, I'd go ahead and keep getting a little extra, about as much as you think she normally eats off your plate ***but NOT make it obvious that you're doing that.***\n\nI don't know why she's being all weird like that, but the problem came in when her image of herself (to herself) was busted by you bringing it out into the open.\n\nWho knows?  Maybe she has some sort of emotional issues around food or something (bad home life? )  For whatever reason, she was either fooling herself or really didn't think she did it that often.  \n\n\nEDIT: I missed that you were a man.  I suspect there might be a healthy helping of \"Oh NOOOEEES!  A boy notices that I eat!!! The  horror!\" mixed in there.", "NTA and I get why you did it but these are times as a young adult you need to have conversations, respectfully and calmly to have just let her know that you rather not share. As simple as that.", "Disclaimer: I'm totally aware that this is coming from my very particular personal perspective and may absolutely not be the case for this person. I cannot diagnose based off of a very vague, singular event.\n\nI'm 31 now, but this reminds me a lot of 18 to 21-year-old me who had a very active but undiagnosed restrictive eating disorder that I was very much in denial about. Eating a couple of extra things off of someone else's plate might have felt safer to me than actually ordering more food, and I probably would have also gotten defensive if someone directly pointed it out. To be clear, that doesn't mean that defensiveness was okay, it just means I was really hurting and in denial and deeply unhappy with myself and probably interpreted anything even tangentially related to food and weight as being insults, because all of those things in my mind WERE insults.\n\nBut even if my guess is right, still absolutey NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm just trying to figure out the correlation of free-munching on your food and defensive behavior with you getting extra FOR HER bc you've wanted your full lunch and knew she'd wanna munch.

I had to be very careful and precise about what I ate and how much, so when I made myself a plate, that was exactly what I needed, in the right amounts. If someone came up and started eating off my plate, they could really mess me up, which could have put me in danger. I don't have to do that anymore, but to this day, I am thoughtful about what I put on my plate, and it's not unreasonable to expect others to respect that. I make sure there's plenty of food for everyone, I'm happy to help them get it, and if someone asks me beforehand, I will sometimes share a bite. But my plate is *my food for me*, and that is important to my health, my sense of safety, and my boundaries. Even my kids don't take food off my plate.\n\nOP you are definitely NTA.

My bet is that in her mind the food she eats off your plate doesn't \"count\" as calories for the day because she can dismiss it as just one or two fries etc. You calling her on it publicly shattered that illusion that her extra eating doesn't count/isn't noticeable, hence why she overreacted & couldn't let it go.", "NTA\u2026, she consistently takes food from your plate, you considered and executed a reasonable response, and she got pissy?

It shows you\u2019re attentive to situations and also that you care enough to consider my needs even when I\u2019m not actively thinking about it", "NTA", "NTA- So people like that exist in real life and not just online? *Fascinating*", "NTA, but knowing women, cut her some slack for today lol", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d does not sound like a nice person.", "Careful, this is some gaslighting behavior. \nShe's moving the blame to you when she knows that she's in the wrong here as she's embarrassed about that.\n\nYou're clearly NTA here, just the defensiveness from her gives me the ick", "NTA. I bet she has issues with food, and tries to limit what she eats. Eating from your plate will seem like \u2018free\u2019 food (not free in a money sense, but free from guilt - \u2018I didn\u2019t order any food, I\u2019ve not eaten any food\u2019 type free). By getting her some food you\u2019ve inadvertently a) messed up today by giving her food when she wanted to imagine she wasn\u2019t eating any food and b) highlighted that on all those previous occasions, she was also eating. \n\nI feel guilt about food too, and try to restrict what I eat. I have the same \u2018free food\u2019 thoughts about eating my kids\u2019 leftovers, and a bite or two when I\u2019m cooking. If someone pointed out to me how all those things add up, it would make me feel bad about myself and (perhaps) react negatively. \n\nIt\u2019s not your issue at all though - you were being kind and there is no way you would have known that this could upset her.", "Op, what you did was kind and thoughtful, you thought of someone else's wants and planned for them. You're a good friend. If that can't be appreciated then your \"friend\" doesn't deserve the kindness you extended towards them. NTA", "> \"oh so you keep track of when I take your food?\"\n\nYes, one tends to remember when they get robbed....\n\nNTA", "NTA, ngl this sounds like having a girlfriend with none of the benefits of having a girlfriend", "Aaaaaannnnd NTN (not the narcissist). She is.", "NTA - but there is major missing info on the other side of this story: either the weirdest expression of a crush ever, an eating disorder, or some kind of constant need for control.", "NTA. She probably has some hang ups about food. I am that way. I used to be super tiny and now have Hashis so struggle. So if my partner says even something innocent like \u201cwhat\u2019s for dinner\u201d if he\u2019s away and the camera has pinged my door dash delivery I get super defensive. Luckily I haven\u2019t actually blown up because I realise how irrational it is, but it\u2019s like this belly flame of \u201chow dare you\u201d and then guilt. For both the anger and the door dash! Hopefully with some self crit your friend will get it. Or she\u2019s a work in process or won\u2019t. But you should know that it\u2019s not you or your fault.", "NTA. While I empathize with people who have issues surrounding food, like...maybe she just shouldn't take food off other people's plates, if she's insecure about eating? You deserve to eat a full meal, too!", "Stay strong OP, Don't let her gaslight you. Just shrug and say, you were trying to be nice to share some free food since you have a meal plan. She doesn't have to eat it if she doesn't want to", "NYA. \n\nYou seem to have covered all bases. \n\nThe only personal experience I had was when I was in middle school my parents packed my lunch but due to the price of a basic cafeteria lunch ($1.50) I convinced my parents to allow me to get a school lunch instead in middle school. There was a girl who would sit with us and legit eat off others plates all the time. She would say \u201ccan I have a fry?\u201d And then just go to town. At the time it was annoying because me and others at the table were not without food at home but also hungry at lunch  and we called her out on it eventually (she took great offense).  I now looking back realize she was not being properly fed at home likely. But like also low income lunches were a thing so if her parents applied they would have gotten it.", "NTA although if she\u2019s ur friend get her into therapy asap bc this sounds like anorexia or the start of it bc ur girl b having major issues with food", "NTA She seems tobtry to betrays herself. If she eat the extra portion of her plate, it counts in her mind as a portion. But a little nibble of people plate? That's nothing! See, i don't eat so much! It is siminlar to \"No i don't want some fries\" and then gobble up over the half of your partner. Cause in their mind they think \"i just ate a few fries, it is nothing!\"\n\nWhen OP gave her the extra portion at the plate and told her that she does it everytime... she could camouflage her behaviour as \"just a few nibbles\" to herself. It all broke down and that\u2019s why she reacted so bad.", ">Hopefully she'll apologize to you\n\nShe won't. I guarantee it. \n\nShe has hang ups about food and it will always be him at fault for \"monitoring\" her food intake and \"judging her\". She will always be the victim in her mind.", "Anyone looking to fight over a simple kindness has issues and OP would be damn lucky if it was only food related.", "I think she might have some issues with having a crush on dude and is embarrassed because she thought they had a cute sharing thing going on.", "EXACTLY", "The memory thing reminded me of a previous job and an incident there.\n\nSo, our timeclock system was down, which meant that we had to write down our time start, lunch, and time end for shifts. We also got fifteen minute breaks that, with the system down, we had to regulate ourselves. This dude was notorious for taking extra-long breaks. Before the system went down, no big deal. It automatically deducted for every minutes over the fifteen. Now? He got paid for sitting on his behind.\n\nOne day, he went on break right before it got super busy. I had been looking at something near the clock and casually noticed the time, it being right on the hour, trying to make time go faster for my own break, He didn't go far, he could clearly see we were busy and needed all hands on deck. The guy came back long after the crowd died down. It was, like, thirty-five minutes later.\n\nWhen he got back to work, I was working on something and looked towards him. He was standing right under the clock, so my brain latched onto the time. Feeling a little pissed because I'd had to deal with impatient customers by myself, I asked him if he enjoyed his thirty-five minute break. He got annoyed and told me not to time his breaks. I told him I normally didn't (which was the truth. I couldn't tell you how long his breaks on any other day had been, just that they were noticeably longer than anyone else's), I just noticed the time for his that day because of the clock\n\nI didn't bother going to complain to our supervisor because she didn't care and it takes more than that for someone to get fired (he did end up getting fired later)\n\nEdit: Long story short, some people just don't like for their actions to be acknowledged", "She became ashamed, became aggressive, and became defensive. You understand.", "NTA. She had to perform some quite strange mental acrobatics in order to go from getting your extra portion to \"I don't need to eat less food.\" That is absurd, to be honest.", "You also can't help but notice when it's literally everytime", "Do not ask her out. Do you really want to be with someone so  flippant?", "She may also have disordered eating she's really sensitive about. [Source: also have a disordered/dysfunctional relationship with food, and it can cause some unhinged outbursts if you're using food to regulate your emotions and someone calls you out on it or innocently alters your plans.] \n\nBut I also wondered about her having a crush on him. I don't think it would be a good idea to ask her out, though, with the attitude she copped.", "My thoughts exactly", "I get but why someone would think that,but i really don't think that's the case. Op basically said \"hey I noticed you keep stealing my food,and I really don't mind, in fact I order some extra, so you can keep stealing from me, even I'm really hungry today\"", "NTA. She likes to steal your food. She enjoys denying you the food you want to consume even though she is not hungry.", "Do not ask her out. Do you really want to be with someone so flippant?", "She needs to check that app NOOM and see WhY she is unconsciously eating OP\u2019s food without realizing how often it happens\u2026", "I was wondering about flirting, too. My husband saw a picture of a menu that had a \"my girlfriend's not hungry\" meal that invited extra fries and maybe a drink? It made me think of that", "Ironic you post something about food on your cake day!\n\nHappy cake day!", "Yes, she has disordered eating and there is a reason that this is considered a mental disorder, when it comes to food her brain is acting especially irrationally.", "I think she might have a little crush and just got embarrassed. Then she dug herself into a big hole. I\u2019d just let it blow over.", "This. Her behavior screams issues with disordered eating. OP is absolutely NTA, but she might not be TA either, just a young woman with shame around food which society has drilled into her.", "Ditto.", "I don't think it's about denying him the food. I think that is a byproduct of her actions, but not the point. She may have had food insecurity in her past, or something to affect her relationship with food but bottom line, her eating off his plate has everything to do with her and nothing to do with him.", "Sometimes children find emotions simply too hard to handle, and they find food soothing and comforting", "Bot", "That's not what flippant means", "Lol that\u2019s not the kind of help she needs", ">that app NOOM\n\nYou mean \"that app\" that gives people eating disorders? That one? That's the one you want to prescribe to someone who already is exhibiting disordered eating?\n\nGreat.", "Or an eating disorder", "But she didn't want to eat the extra food he gave her. It being his food seems fairly central.", "Most colleges have all you can eat some dining halls, which is what this sounds like. Being on a meal plan is cheaper than paying for it every meal", "My bad, I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s different where I went to/live. I thought everytime OP gets good and pays, friend helps herself. Now it makes sense. Thanks for pointing it out to me."]}
