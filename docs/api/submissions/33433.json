While we were playing she said she wanted to have some of her college friends over on Friday. I said sure! But then I looked at our calendar on the wall and saw she was working late on Friday (10-7). I asked her if she remembered that and she said \u201cshit no I forgot\u201d. I then asked if she would be okay to hangout with them after working a long shift and she said \u201cWe\u2019ll I haven\u2019t seen them in forever and I don\u2019t wanna do it saturday because I want that to be a lazy day so it is what it is\u201d.

I know that takes a lot out of you maybe Saturday or Sunday would be better?\u201d She then went off about how I am trying to control her and \u201cforce her to think things through when I just want to wing it\u201d. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t care about her friends coming over, in fact I hope they do! I am just upset that my GF is telling me to not help her think things through. I don\u2019t think I want to be with a person who genuinely gets mad at me for thinking through our problems. It\u2019s one thing if this is something she already thought about but she literally said \u201cshit I forgot\u201d when I brought up her shift so I don\u2019t understand how thinking this through is a bad thing.

Instead, it's that you think you know what is best for her and want her to \"think things through\" until she agrees with you.", "The latest big red flag being talked about on social media is partners who feel the need to teach a lesson.

Apparently she had a long day at work yesterday and was tired of answering questions all day so when I brought up the fact she has work on Friday and she forgot she just didn\u2019t want to think about it and was tired. She now says that is not an excuse for how she talked back to me and is saying now she is glad I brought it up. She no longer feels I was being controlling and said that she said that out of anger. She also recognized that over our 3.5 years together I\u2019ve never forced her to be on my side and she is very appreciative of that and wants that to continue.\n\nTLDR: ITA for being condescending, STA for lashing out after work AND this probably didn\u2019t need to become a whole thing.", "Consider that for her hanging out with friends is relaxing after a long day - not another chore to plow through?\n\nNAH", "NAH\n\nI don't think you \"made her think things through\", you just reminded her of something she'd forgotten.

Of course if you change the context entirely, things will looks different.", "Oh I didn\u2019t realize that you were saying that you were going to take time off work to have a fun day with the guys.  I would trust that you would know if that was acceptable or not for your workplace.  And if I was you in this scenario I wouldn\u2019t expect someone to help me regulate my behavior, because I am an adult and I trust my own judgement.  I would believe that I AM seeing the big picture and that having one fun day isn\u2019t going to jeopardize my future.

That's not a good partner. A good partner brings important information to your attention and then you make a decision based on that additional information. That's how a partnership works. \n\nSo in your example here, your gf saw a potential problem, brought it to your attention, and then let you make the final decision like the adult you are. She didn't try to control you and didn't belittle you and force you to do something that she thought was more responsible.\n\nA real partnership means everyone treating each other like adults.

In this scenario you're meeting them after a long day if work, which is your choice and she respects that.\n\n Also, back to the original scenario - catching up with old friends is in no way the same as gambling (a life action you don't support). This is a false equivalency you're literally just adding for no reason. Do the scenario without the gambling lmao. You're illogical, pedantic, and exhausting. The judgement is harsh, but you're on the judgement thread on a judgement platform, so I'm calling it as it is.

What you said is very valid.", "She said \"shit oh I forgot.\" Is that not acknowledging she forgot about the shift. The more you try to explain, the more I understand why she got mad.

Can you recognize her need for space and for you to show confidence in her decision-making abilities?

So step 1 is taken care of. She acknowledged she forgot the shift. \n\nStep 2 How will that affect her plans.\n\n It doesn't.  The unspoken part before \"I haven't seen them in forever, etc.\" Is even though it's after a long shift.\"I haven't seen them in forever...\" You just want to hear specific words and refuse to infer her meaning from what she said.", "Yes. It is. She weighed her desire to see these people and her desire to have Saturday as a lazy day and made her decision. You really are controlling.", "Are you truly so socially inept? It is an express acknowledgment of that fact. It is her saying she understands but there is no better alternative and she still wants to do this so she will make it work. \n\nDo you often have trouble with things like using context to make educated assumptions? At work, do you require every step of an instruction laid out explicitly? Is decision-making something you yourself struggle with? Do you often find yourself on the outside of jokes or common understanding because you didn\u2019t pick up on the nuance?", "Yes, you are, or some version of that.

You reminded her of the shift, and she said she forgot and then said she still wants them to come over on Friday because she wanted Saturday to be a lazy day. \n\nShe did exactly what you say you wanted her to do, and she gave you her reasoning for sticking with Friday. Why don't you trust your girlfriend's choices?", "But \"oh yea, I forgot. Oh well, it is what it is\" doesn't count as her acknowledging that she forgot? You want her to respond in a specific way and you're trying to teach her to do so...", "So a lot of what you said has had some validity to it, this is where you are dead wrong.\n\nI wholeheartedly don\u2019t care what she does as long as she addresses what I asked. To prove that here are examples of responses I would have loved to get:\n\n\u201cYea it\u2019ll suck but I still want to see them\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but I\u2019ll make myself an extra coffee at the end of the shift so that I can stay up\u201d\n\u201cIt may suck but maybe you can make us lunch and dinner so that I won\u2019t be as stressed\u201d"]}
