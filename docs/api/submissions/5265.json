My stepsister, Allie (33f) was married to Rob (30m), who through the years has become good friends with Max. \nAllie and Rob named their first son after Max (not the same name-Max/Maxwell) and we always said we would return the favor. Allie and Rob went through a nasty divorce about three years after she discovered he was having an affair. After, I stopped hanging out with Rob as much but Max and Rob are still very close. Which brings us to today, Max's brother as a Xmas gift, is making wood art of our son's name. We decided to publicly announce his name since everyone is going to know soon. We decided to go ahead with the variation of Rob's name. We did a name reveal on Facebook and immediately begun to get comments. My stepmom and Allie begun to blow up my phone, telling me I can't name my baby the chosen name because I'm throwing Rob in her face and disrespecting her. \nI pointed out that Allie and Rob share kids so he's in her life forever. At this point we feel that the name is our son's name because it has basically been his name in our mind the whole time. \nAllie is not speaking to me at this time and I'm feeling awkward about going to my parent's house for Xmas (don't want to argue in front of the kids). My husband and I feels like Allie is being overly sensitive because she is still hurt.\nI need a neutral opinion on whether we're being assholes?\n\nEdit to add: \n1. My husband doesn't condone cheating. He never has and would never cheat on me. Our marriage is healthy.\n2. I don't hate my stepsister, our relationship isn't on the same level as with my bio-sis but I have loved Allie and her mom since day 1.\n3.

Sure it does.\nAgnostic non-Christian here, fwiw, and I'll go on record now to state that I think most people on Reddit are far too prudish when it comes to nudity and consensual sex.\n\nHowever.\n\nWhen you are married to someone, you promise them something. In the vast majority of cases, you promise that your spouse gets exclusive rights to your genitals. Beside you doing stuff with yourself, which I'm sure is your own business, your spouse gets to help decide who has access to your naughty bits. No screwing around unless spouse says you can.\n\nThis is a fundamental tenet of marriage, because it allows people to trust. Even unmarried couples who call themselves couples usually have this understanding that they don't go banging other people.\n\nWe talk a lot about trust in this sub. Can I be forgiven for going through my gf's phone? No, you should have trusted her. Should I let my boyfriend be friends with this really hot woman? Yes, you need to trust him. Etc etc. Trust in a relationship is paramount. So sister trusted her husband.\n\nHe has broken that trust and thereby upended her life. Divorce is no joke. There are financial repercussions, broken-hearted kids, relatives and friends taking sides. He did all that to the sister by what you so callously call, \"one thing he did.\"  (Over and over, I might add; it was an affair, not a one-night-stand.)\nThis is why we call it \"thinking with their genitals\". Because they're not thinking about the enormity of what they're doing to the other person in their supposed partnership.\n\nAnd that brings us to today. OP wants to name her son after this dude. Naming your kid after someone is generally thought of as a way to honour them. Like you want your kid to follow in their footsteps, or you want them to know you're thinking of them, or you want to remind others of a much-loved relative who has passed. When I named my firstborn after my grandmother, my uncles were in tears. It's a very emotional thing.\n\nSo this is who OP wants to name her son after. The guy who ruined her sister's life because he couldn't keep it in his pants. Earlier, we touched on how in a divorce, the family takes sides.

Every one is right in their own unique way but NAH.", "It all really depends on what the name is tbh :D", "Excuse me.\n\nYou fuckin' WHAT??", "No. Max is still best friends with Rob. You\u2019re incredibly naive if you think that its no longer a tribute to Rob. OP can call her child whatever she wants but that doesn\u2019t stop her being the biggest asshole. \n\nOP - you seemed to have had a close relationship with your sister, if you want to continue this relationship please reconsider. You are deliberately hurting your sister. How would you feel if Max cheated on you, destroyed your family and then your sister (who knows exactly what the impact of the last 3 years has done to you) decided to name her child after Max knowing how much he hurt you? It would constantly remind you of what Max has done every time you went to visit. There are a million names out there but your stuck on the one that would destroy the relationship with your sister? Why? Because your husband is his best friend, he supports him and his affair by naming his child after him.\n\nIn case it wasn\u2019t clear YTA. Which is more important to you? Allowing your husband to name your child after his best friend who has been consistently hurting your sister for over 3 years AFTER having an affair, which would destroy any relationship you have with her OR change the name to something else and keep the relationship with your sister and tell your husband you refuse to name your child after someone who would cause that much pain. It\u2019s as simple as that.", "Its different changing the name of a real ass child than a baby not born yet.  And she specifically says it was to honor Rob. So that remains as their initial motivation. She can burn her relationship to the ground to honor a cheater but that makes her the ah", "In all fairness, when I read the title I was wondering what could possibly be the reason. And his being the father was an idea.\n\nThen I read it. And OP isn't very nice to her sister...", "Yeah, Aita gets pretty ridiculous at times.", "Ah, this might be why you can't understand...\n\nI don't get very emotional about sex, I see it majorily as a fun physical thing, not some deep emotional connection...\n\nBUT I appreciate that most other people don't see it the way I do.  For most people sex is like, the emotional apex of their relationship, a truly unique and special connection that is sacred within their relationship, and having that physical connection with someone else is the WORST possible thing someone could do.\n\nYou don't have to feel that way yourself, to know that other people do.", "Absolutely not. I'm sorry but if you're in a conventional marriage there is an expectation and promise of monogamy. He broke that and if they were still being intimate while he stuck his penis in other people, he put his wife at risk. She did not consent to the possibility of getting an STD. She consented to sex with her husband not with her husband who had a side piece. \n\nAnd please spare me the \"he could have worn a condom\" bs. They help with preventing STDs, they're not foolproof.", "Just wanted to point out that OP already has a nephew called Max. So if she has a nasty breakup with her Max she will have someone she see's often, not only named the same, but actually named after her ex.\n\nAll in all, don't name kids after people who are still alive. That will avoid all these issues. lol.", "It's not that different if you hate/don't like him so much. Are we drawing the line here? If its convenient we dictate if its not we move on. \n\nCan we please stop talking about him like he killed thousands of thousands innocent little infants? He cheated on her. She divorced him. End of the story. \n\nCan you quote the word ''honoring Rob''. Either i am blind or u people trying to put words into her mouth and make urself the righteous ones, hilarously.\n\nThey (Stepsis and Rob) gave their childs name after Max. They (OP and Max) thought about gaving their childs name after Rob to return the favor which is done by rob **and stepsis**. Probably for months they think it was a good name and everyone thought the same **including stepsis**. So in the end 2 parents gave their child a name(it doesn't matter if he is born or not, they chose that name and felt good about it). Now that stepsis knows she has been cheated she want to change their sons name. If it upsets you that much you simply sit down, take a deep breath and suck it up. But you can't say ''you can't name ur baby''.", "if she would have done it  to spit her, I would absolutly aggree.. she just does not care about her feelings.. do you care about everyones feelings? and even if you do sometimes you just care more for someone else", "You literally described honoring and are playing a semantic game. Which is bullshit.\n\nI care about my siblings and friends. If someone did my friend wrong (your ridiculous hyperbole aside, it's still a horrible thing to do) I wouldn't name my kid after them"]}
