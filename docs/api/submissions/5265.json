My stepsister, Allie (33f) was married to Rob (30m), who through the years has become good friends with Max. \nAllie and Rob named their first son after Max (not the same name-Max/Maxwell) and we always said we would return the favor. Allie and Rob went through a nasty divorce about three years after she discovered he was having an affair. After, I stopped hanging out with Rob as much but Max and Rob are still very close. Which brings us to today, Max's brother as a Xmas gift, is making wood art of our son's name. We decided to publicly announce his name since everyone is going to know soon. We decided to go ahead with the variation of Rob's name. We did a name reveal on Facebook and immediately begun to get comments. My stepmom and Allie begun to blow up my phone, telling me I can't name my baby the chosen name because I'm throwing Rob in her face and disrespecting her. \nI pointed out that Allie and Rob share kids so he's in her life forever. At this point we feel that the name is our son's name because it has basically been his name in our mind the whole time. \nAllie is not speaking to me at this time and I'm feeling awkward about going to my parent's house for Xmas (don't want to argue in front of the kids).

Give him a name which will bring EVERYONE happiness.  So, he will always be in her life......I'm sure she'd gladly like him OUT of it, but must accept dealing with him because they share children.
