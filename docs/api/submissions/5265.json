My stepsister, Allie (33f) was married to Rob (30m), who through the years has become good friends with Max. \nAllie and Rob named their first son after Max (not the same name-Max/Maxwell) and we always said we would return the favor. Allie and Rob went through a nasty divorce about three years after she discovered he was having an affair. After, I stopped hanging out with Rob as much but Max and Rob are still very close. Which brings us to today, Max's brother as a Xmas gift, is making wood art of our son's name. We decided to publicly announce his name since everyone is going to know soon. We decided to go ahead with the variation of Rob's name. We did a name reveal on Facebook and immediately begun to get comments. My stepmom and Allie begun to blow up my phone, telling me I can't name my baby the chosen name because I'm throwing Rob in her face and disrespecting her. \nI pointed out that Allie and Rob share kids so he's in her life forever. At this point we feel that the name is our son's name because it has basically been his name in our mind the whole time. \nAllie is not speaking to me at this time and I'm feeling awkward about going to my parent's house for Xmas (don't want to argue in front of the kids). My husband and I feels like Allie is being overly sensitive because she is still hurt.\nI need a neutral opinion on whether we're being assholes?", "created_utc": 1671599743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrb5wd/aita_for_naming_my_son_after_sisters_ex/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve picked a family name that happens to be the name of her ex. You are naming the baby AFTER here cheating ex. You really don\u2019t see the issue?", "YTA", "YTA - Name your son whatever you want but she\u2019s not being overly sensitive for being cheated on.\n\nSide question, did Max know Rob was cheating?", "YTA. Yes you can choose any name you want, it's your baby. But you had to of known this was going to happen. Of course your sister is going to react that way, Rob cheated on her and your husband is all buddy buddy with him.", "I'm really surprised you are even asking......YOU KNOW YOUR THE ASSHOLE.", "No doubt about it YTA\n\nJust read everyone else\u2019s response.", "YTA - you are choosing to forever alienate your sister from your kids", "YTA...  Assuming the relationship with your stepsister and stepmom is longstanding and good... how do you put this CHEATER ahead of them? I am a bonus mom and my husband is a bonus dad and I can honestly say that these relationships are valued as much as bio ones. How dare you put a beautiful angel in the middle of a CHEATING  divorce. He has nothing to do with this and yet he'll be forever branded.", "YTA- Where is your loyalty to YOUR sister?\n\nWhy would you name your kid after a liar and a cheater?\nAfter he cheated that pretty much should have canceled any deals with naming any child after him. You really are willing to destroy a relationship with your sister for this? You have no excuses. Do better.", "YTA he is her ex for a reason. Sorry it's just weird to me how you would need a child after someone who hurt your family.", "YTA\n\nYou're naming your child after an EX that cheated on your step sister.   You and Max are both major assholes.", "Your husband is still very close with your sister\u2019s cheating ex?  \n\nAlso, YTA. Of course.", "YTA and you and your husband are both gross", "You can name your kid after whomever  you want. It\u2019s your choice, not your sisters. But, do you really want to name your child after an adulterer? \n\nYour lack of empathy toward your sister is astounding. Your husband feels she\u2019s overreacting because she is hurt? Really Sherlock? A man who she believed she would spend her life with, who she had children with, began an affair which led to her life, and her kids lives, being forever changed. She went through a, as you stated, nasty divorce for three years? \n\nIt\u2019s hard to fathom why your sister wouldn\u2019t want her nephew to be named after someone who caused her so much pain and heartache.", "YTA.\n\nFor telling your sister she's being sensitive and diminishing her feelings. Your not just giving your child the same name as someone who betrayed her, you are naming your child after him specifically. I feel bad for your child already as this will probably be drama for him. I get that you've been set on that name for a while, but you should be okay with your sister being upset by it and having a strained relationship with her. I mean it is bad enough that her BIL is still close friends with him. This is just icing on a crap cake for her. Own your choice if you want to keep it, but don't be surprised if your relationship sucks from this point on.", "No doubt, YTA!  Allie found out Rob was cheating on her, and that was the reason of their divorce.  That is always going to cause her pain!  So why do you believe it'd be a good idea to name your SON after a man who cheated on his wife and broke up their home?  Why would you and Max want to bring discomfort and pain over the sake of a name?!  If you continue on to name him after her cheating ex husband, then everyone has a few loose screws.  Give him a name which will bring EVERYONE happiness.  So, he will always be in her life......I'm sure she'd gladly like him OUT of it, but must accept dealing with him because they share children.  Both you and your husband are being incredible selfish and insensitive.  There are many nice names out there....pick one of those, and stop tormenting her.", "NTA. You sure are weird to do that and you deserve all of the animosity you get.", "NTA. There are a million people in the world named Rob, is she just going to hate all of them? You also said it's a *variation* of the name, so it's not even exactly his name. No matter what, she doesn't get a say in what you name your kid.", "This is one of those situations where I feel either no one is an AH or everyone sucks a little bit. I get where everyone is coming from.\n\nNAH", "NTA, but your sister is reasonably upset. You could've avoided conflict by picking a different name... the wood thing didn't help that problem though. Good luck with the sittiation mate", "NTA since you could name your kid what ever you want , why name them after someone who cheated on your sister is beyond me. But you\u2019re right in the fact that rob will always be in the family\u2019s life regardless if your son is named after him", "Is this for real?  Your kid, your choice, everyone else can fuck right off if they have a problem with it.  How incredibly childish they are if they think they have any say at all in this.  Does Allie plan on changing her son's name, now that your husband has become the personification of pure evil?\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
