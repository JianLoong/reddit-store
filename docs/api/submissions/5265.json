We decided to go ahead with the variation of Rob's name. We did a name reveal on Facebook and immediately begun to get comments. My stepmom and Allie begun to blow up my phone, telling me I can't name my baby the chosen name because I'm throwing Rob in her face and disrespecting her. \nI pointed out that Allie and Rob share kids so he's in her life forever. At this point we feel that the name is our son's name because it has basically been his name in our mind the whole time. \nAllie is not speaking to me at this time and I'm feeling awkward about going to my parent's house for Xmas (don't want to argue in front of the kids).
