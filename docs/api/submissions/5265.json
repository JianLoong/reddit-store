When my ex-husband told me he cheated (while I was in freaking BOOT CAMP) I fainted. Deadass fainted in the shitty tollbooth I called him from hoping to hear the sound of a friendly voice. Then I had to finish out boot camp knowing KNOWING my husband slept with someone else while I was in this shit hole. Something broke inside of me that day and I have never gotten it back. Oh and the kicker, we'd only been married 4 months together for 18 months.

Sure it does.\nAgnostic non-Christian here, fwiw, and I'll go on record now to state that I think most people on Reddit are far too prudish when it comes to nudity and consensual sex.\n\nHowever.\n\nWhen you are married to someone, you promise them something. In the vast majority of cases, you promise that your spouse gets exclusive rights to your genitals. Beside you doing stuff with yourself, which I'm sure is your own business, your spouse gets to help decide who has access to your naughty bits. No screwing around unless spouse says you can.\n\nThis is a fundamental tenet of marriage, because it allows people to trust. Even unmarried couples who call themselves couples usually have this understanding that they don't go banging other people.\n\nWe talk a lot about trust in this sub. Can I be forgiven for going through my gf's phone? No, you should have trusted her. Should I let my boyfriend be friends with this really hot woman? Yes, you need to trust him. Etc etc. Trust in a relationship is paramount. So sister trusted her husband.\n\nHe has broken that trust and thereby upended her life. Divorce is no joke. There are financial repercussions, broken-hearted kids, relatives and friends taking sides. He did all that to the sister by what you so callously call, \"one thing he did.\"  (Over and over, I might add; it was an affair, not a one-night-stand.)\nThis is why we call it \"thinking with their genitals\". Because they're not thinking about the enormity of what they're doing to the other person in their supposed partnership.\n\nAnd that brings us to today. OP wants to name her son after this dude. Naming your kid after someone is generally thought of as a way to honour them. Like you want your kid to follow in their footsteps, or you want them to know you're thinking of them, or you want to remind others of a much-loved relative who has passed. When I named my firstborn after my grandmother, my uncles were in tears. It's a very emotional thing.\n\nSo this is who OP wants to name her son after. The guy who ruined her sister's life because he couldn't keep it in his pants. Earlier, we touched on how in a divorce, the family takes sides. This is OP basically telling sister, \"lol screw you and your feelings, I'm naming my son after Robwad because what he put you through really isn't anything to us compared to him and Max's bromance.\"\n\nIf I were the sister, I'd be insulted.", "But it is an entertaining leap, like soap opera level.", "No she is Not an asshole....her live does Not Turn arround the sister..she is Not the Most important Person in her live....that does Not make her an ah", "Did the goat consent?

I know I should have told you, but well it happend and I like it and want to continue\" would not have worked out better for him would it?
