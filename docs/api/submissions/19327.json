{"id": 19327, "submission_id": "144kszk", "title": "WIBTA for making a crochet blanket as a wedding present for my brother and his fiance?", "selftext": "I (F18) was invited to go to my brother's (M24) wedding that is next year. I've known my brother's fiance for about 5 years and she has always been very sweet and I really like her and can't wait for them to get married as they make each other happy. The problem comes in regards to the gift.\n\nWhen I was told they were going to get married a couple months ago I decided a good present would be a crochet blanket for them. This blanket would be pretty big because my brother is tall but I wanted it to kind of be like a throw that can go over the couch. I went out and got really good and soft quality yarn as well as swatched different stitches to see how they would look together in a blanket. I even took into account that they might appreciate an acrylic yarn so they can throw it in the washer and dryer without worrying about ruining it or needing to hand wash the blanket. I started it not long ago and it is coming out really great but I recently went out to eat with my group of friends and they all said that it was a terrible wedding present. Most of the comments I got is that it would be seen as cheap and a waste of space in their home. My best friend even said that it would be best to get something off the gift registry and that giving a blanket is kind of a plain gift to give to someone at their wedding. However, they don't have a gift registry and I don't think they will make one because they just aren't those kinds of people who focus on stuff like that.\n\nThe thing is that the yarn is not cheap and I tried telling them that but none of them crochet so I don't think they fully understood what I was saying. I've already spent about $80 on yarn and that doesn't take into account the price of the fabric backing I need to get and the problem that the yarn I have right now might not be enough resulting in me needing to buy more in the future. This is my first time crocheting a blanket but I have made smaller projects for my brother in the past (mainly hats because he loves them). I'm just worried that I chose the wrong thing and already invested a good amount of money and time in a gift that would be seen as useless.\n\nMy mom says it would make a great gift but so many of my friends are telling me that it is a bad idea and to get them something else. I am very conflicted and don't want to give my brother something that he wouldn't like or need. Luckily if I am the one in the wrong then I can probably save up money from my job and get something else but it would be a shame to waste the time and effort I already put into starting this project.\n\nI guess I never took into account that a blanket might not be a good present but I guess it isn't a very extravagant gift for a wedding. This would be my first time attending a wedding and I don't want to ruin it somehow by not understanding the unwritten rules of gift giving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Since I have seen this brought up often I thought it would be good to give a bit more info. My brother and FSIL like neutral colors when decorating their house. My brother loves the monochrome scale so anything black, gray, and white. My FSIL also likes it although she gravitates more towards the lighter side such as light gray or white. The couch they have is a dark gray and the blanket I am making is on the lighter side of gray so they will go well together and I took into account that it would look good with most colors they decorate with in the future. I originally wanted to use their favorite colors but my brother likes red and my FSIL likes blue and I couldn't make them both work in a blanket. Maybe I can use those colors to embroider something on the fabric backing.", "created_utc": 1686257646, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144kszk/wibta_for_making_a_crochet_blanket_as_a_wedding/", "score": 628, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No offense, but your friends don't know diddly. Do you know what I remember most about my wedding gifts from 16 years ago? The beautiful handmade blanket a friend crocheted especially for us with our names & wedding date (we still have it & love it). What I don't remember? Which people bought us plate sets or salt shakers or a juicer or whatever from our registry. Not that we didn't appreciate every gift, but thoughtful, handmade gifts - especially ones that take significant time, effort & skill to craft - live in the recipient's memory forever. Keep on with your blanket, girl! He's gonna love it\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. This is such a sweet gift idea! Personally, I think everyone loves a hand-made gift, especially from their sister! I think this is really cute. Don't listen to your friends, I mean, have any of them been to a wedding either? Besides, it's not like you're crocheting something they would never use. A blanket is needed in a house and I think it would be a fun story to tell. Also, you're so kind to think about everything - acrylic yarn and your brothers' height, etc. Keep on making your beautiful gift!", "NTA. Listen to your mother on this. It's such a great idea for a thoughtful and unique gift. Your friends' response is immature and tactless.", "NTA. The people criticising you are people who don't understand how much money, time, effort and skill it costs to make a blanket. Their viewpoint is totally moo.", "NTA. Some people love homemade gifts and others don\u2019t. You\u2019ve learned that your friends don\u2019t but you know your brother does. I\u2019m sure he will love it.", "NTA! Don't listen to your friends. They sound very materialistic and shallow. Your brother and fiancee will definitely love something you've put so much love and time into!", "Sounds like beautiful gift! Ok maybe not something your friends would want but you're not making it for them. \n\nI still have a crochet blanket a colleague of my dad made and gifted him when I was born. They have both passed now and it means a lot to me. That thing has lasted 39 years and still going strong. NTA.", ">My mom says it would make a great gift but so many of my friends are telling me that it is a bad idea\n\nWho do you think is wiser? Your mom or your friends? NTA.", "I would be thrilled! Doubly thrilled if it's machine washable- sure, real wool is beautiful and all but it's so tedious to wash.\n\nDon't listen to your friends.\n\nNTA", "NTA i'm sorry but your friends suck. i would be SO excited to receive a gift like that especially knowing it was handmade with love. I don't think your friends understand how much time, effort and love goes into crocheting, especially when it's a gift. My grandmother knitted my three brothers, my two cousins and I a blanket for when we were born. Each one was made with different colors and you could just tell she put so much love into it. We all still have our blankets now and cherish them. I am positive your brother and his fianc\u00e9 will adore the gift and cherish it too.", "Sweetie, I have the afgha  my late mom made me 30 some years ago. I still have the one my besties late mom made me from about 30 years ago. And one from bestie about 10 years ago. \n\nYou are NTA. Your friends lack maturity. That's not their fault. But unless you crochet you don't get the amount of work and love it in.\n\nYour brother will see it and he will know how hard you worked and he will treasure that gift for decades to come.  Same can't be said for a toaster! \n\nYou're a good sibling. I'm sure your brother appreciates you :)", "Absolutely NTA! I\u2019d be thrilled to receive such a lovely gift. Your thoughtfulness, time, and artistic talent will create something beautiful, timeless, and bespoke. I\u2019d love to see a photo update when you\u2019re ready!\n\nDon\u2019t listen to your friends, you\u2019re miles ahead in maturity.", "NTA i have a friend who crochets and i would be thrilled to receive a blanket from her. Your skills, time, love, care and everything you are putting into this gift are real, and they will see them and feel them. It's a wonderful gift and I'd be very touched that you're spending so much time and resources planning and executing it.", "NTA. That is an absolutely lovely present, and they will treasure it for years to come. You are a great sister for being so thoughtful. I imagine this is taking you hours and hours and hours. Don't listen to your friends--they are way too materialistic. Listen to your mom! She knows your brother far better than your friends do.", "NTA\n\nIgnore your friends as they are the assholes. A crochet blankets is A LOT of work. The blood (not really) sweat (really) tears (100%) that goes into making one is insane. \n\nMost people don't understand how much work goes into something like that. It's special. Something people keep and cherish forever. Not a lot of people can handmake such a gift and I'm sure your brother and his wife will love it. \n\nI crochet blankets and toys. When I tell people what I make, you wouldn't believe the amount of people who show me their crochet items family members have made for them. Blankets from grandma, aunties, mums. It's really lovely to see them. Please don't give up on your blanket idea.", "Info: is this something they've expressed interest in? It's only because I remember the post from a woman who made gifts for everyone but didn't consider whether they would like them or not but then got hurt when they didn't. This sort of thing isn't to everyone's taste so it's important that you think of their values, not yours. Yes it takes a lot of time and is expensive: but is it something that they'll use and fits their aesthetic? If yes go for it!", "NTA.  If your brother knows you like to crochet perhaps he\u2019s even hoping for something handmade from you.  If you are still worried, write them a card as well, say how you hope they like it and picked out soft yarn in their favorite colors, or just something that shows you put a lot of thought and love into your gift.  But they will know that already :)", "NTA. Anyone who thinks a hand crocheted blanket is the \"cheap\" route clearly has no idea how much time and work it takes to make one. It's a lot of dedication to see such a project through to the end, on top of the thought you put into choosing materials and designing it. The value of gifts isn't based solely on the money spent.\n\nAs for if it will get used, even if they don't use it on their bed or something, you did intend it to go over a couch so they can still have it as a decorative item. And when a cold snap hits or there are a lot of unexpected overnight guests, extra blankets are a really nice thing to have on hand", "NTA it\u2019s months of work and yarn is expensive - sure you could buy some factory made thing but this is personal.  You are 18 - no one should expect a more expensive gift from you.", "Wow.   Would be beautiful.   NTA.", "NTA, your friends are being very immature. But I'd check about the acrylic yarn, if I were you, as it's possible to be allergic to it (I know this first-hand, sadly! I can't be around it without my eyes swell shut and I start to sneeze!).", "Your \"friends\" are all terrible.  You know your brother and future SIL better than they do, and I'm sure they'd love it!  I know I would!  IF they've not done a registry, then they probably wont and would far more appreciate something that came from your heart than your wallet.   But at least now you know to not attend weddings or give gifts to your so-called friends.  NTA", "NTA! If my sister made me a blanket for a wedding present I\u2019d be thrilled. I love blankets personally and also knowing that you put all that time and effort and love into it will make your brother and his fianc\u00e9 love it more! Please don\u2019t listen to your friends. This is a great gift <3", "NTA quite frankly your friends are kids, who don\u2019t understand the values in home comforts yet.\n\nBlankets are the kind of thing a lot of people need to live without before seeing the joy in them.\n\nBut if someone made me a blanket, I\u2019d probably hug them to death", "NTA trust your mom, who knows your brother and SIL and says it's great, not your friends here.  I'm guessing they don't have skills like that, and don't appreciate the time and effort that goes into making something like that.  \n\nAlso you're 18, no one is expecting you to fork over a ton of cash for an expensive gift.", "Mostly NTA!\n\nAs a crocheter I can say that, as much as yarn isn't cheap, the labor put into making a blanket is worth even more.  A lot of people undervalue both, thinking yarn is like $5 and ignoring the time and effort put in, and there's a risk that handcrafted items might not go over well.  But it sounds like your brother appreciates handmade items.\n\n(Handmade blankets/quilts can even become heirloom items!)", "NTA at all. \n\nMy husband and I got a homemade crochet blanket somewhere amongst our engagement and wedding from a good family friend. I use it to curl up under and watch tv or read a book. It\u2019s nice and comfy and honestly one of my most loved/used gifts ever. \n\nDefinitely not a waste and I\u2019m sure they will appreciate it too.", "NTA. The people who'd know best whether your brother and his fianc\u00e9 would appreciate the gift are you and your family. Everyone else can kick rocks", "NTA. Your friends aren't your brother. If he likes your gifts in the past then this sounds like a wonderful present. Handmade gifts are always sweet. And ps, your friends kind of suck.", "My grandma has alzheimers. I would give anything to get a blanket from her now. Don't undervalue yourself.", "Your friends are wrong and you are 18. I wouldn't have even expected a present; I'd assume you'd be on the card with whatever mom and dad give. NTA and actually it's incredibly thoughtful what you are giving.", "I vote NTA, especially since that is what I made my sister for her wedding...", "NTA. Your friends are so completely wrong and don\u2019t appreciate the sentimental value and worth of a homemade crocheted blanket. Firstly yarn and fabric are really expensive. Secondly, a blanket would take hours and hours to crochet. Nothing about these facts makes a crocheted blanket \u201ccheap\u201d. You\u2019ve obviously put so much thought and effort into the blanket, and I think your brother and SIL will appreciate it. Ignore your friends, and don\u2019t let them ruin your joy in gifting the blanket. Oh, please don\u2019t ever crochet a blanket for your friends as they don\u2019t deserve such a lovely gift.", "NTA. In my family giving handmade gifts is a tradition. My grandmother made me a crocheted blanket when I first moved away from home and I still love it and use it. My mom made me one for my graduation, and my sister made me a quilt for my bday. They're among my most prized possessions. \n\nThose types of gifts will last for a lifetime if you take good care of them.", "NTA and your friends really don't realize how totally wrong they are.\n\nDo your thing. It'll be amazing, special and really appreciated.", "NTA\n\nYour friends don't know your family. My best friend is getting married and if I had the skill to do this I 100% would because she LOVES handmade everything and her fiance loves everything that makes her happy. They also don't need anything. She's currently freaking out because she found out I'm hand making her birthday presents. \n\nSome people really enjoy handmade presents. Especially when the person making them has skill, and can put thought like you have into it. Making a handmade blanket YOU CAN WASH!? Dude! \n\nYour brother likes your hats, your mom says it's a good idea. This is sweet, thoughtful and incredibly appropriate.", "NTA\n\nI crochet, I think it's a lovely idea. For me, I feel like it means more to make something. It can take a lot of time, planning and frogging to make something large like that. I think it shows you're really thinking about them.", "I'm going to assume your friends are around your age, they don't know what a good wedding gift is because they haven't experienced many weddings while old enough to give gifts. If your brother and SIL aren't the type of people to make a registry then I'd be willing to bet they'd really like a handmade blanket. Plus as a person who lives on their own I love blankets and you can't have too many. NTA, don't listen to your friends.", "I got one when my Daughter was born \u2764\ufe0fit's so beautiful and soft.. it was my favorite gift actually. My mom and dad were gifted a quilt with the date and names stitched on it that was on their bed until my dad passed. Now mom has it over our couch. These are so sentimental, so much effort and time was spent and that means more than anything someone could pick up at a store \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Please do it , it will mean so much", "NTA, it is a very personal gift that I think is great. The funny thing about wedding gifts is you kind of forget who gave you what over the years. But this is something they would always remember and the appreciation and love for it would grow more and more over the years.", "Yarn is expensive and crochet is detailed, time consuming work. The blanket is a meaningful piece of art that you put a lot of thought and time into. Nta.", "NTA. My grandma made me a quilt that I got when I got married. I love it and use it a ton. Its on my bed right now, in fact. I quilt and have made a few quilts for friends and family as gifts that they love and use. So, as a fellow crafter, your gift is not cheap or crappy or whatever. I know how much money goes into supplies as well as how much time it takes to create something like that. If a sibling of mine had given me something they made like that I would love and cherish it. Im sure your brother and his soon to be wife will love your gift.", "So NTA this is a wonderful, very sweet gift which I absolutely guarantee will be used and cherished for years. Best gift my husband and I received for our wedding was a handmade quilt from one of our best friends and ex roommates and we use it all the time, it travels the world with us. I think your brother and future SIL will love it personally", "NTA.  You're making them an heirloom.  I treasure the blanket a loved one crocheted for me.  It's a lovely gift.", "I'm going against the grain here.  I knit, quilt etc and unless I knew the person I was gifting was into a home made craft and look, I wouldn't waste my time and money on them.  Have you asked your brother and his fiance if they'd be interested?  I'm also going to be honest, that I don't like the look of most crochet.  There are some pretty rad patterns out there and some awesome colour combos, but, to me, crochet is super dense and can often look old fashioned.  I don't think you're wrong for this, but I also think there is a world of hurt for you if they end up not loving it, especially when a simple conversation on interests and decor would have resolved it prior to the financial and time investment had been made.  Just ask your brother and his fiance.  They'll either love the idea and you can continue or they won't and you can be sad for a bit, but maybe put aside for now and revisit it for someone else who would enjoy it.", "INFO: Is there ANY indication at all they like that kind of things? This sond more like something you do for yourself, as your hobby.", "I would design a whole room around a hand made blanket. NTA what a wonderful and thoughtful gift - acrylic yarn to wash!!!", "YTA Only because a lot of people are very sensitive to acrylic and if I got something like that, I would never be able to use it. I think if you were going to make a blanket and you are close to your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9, you might have searched out with her if  something like this would be appreciated. There\u2019s nothing worse than going to the time and expense of making something like this to then find out it will never be used or not liked. I think sadly, there is a stigma against homemade gifts. If you don\u2019t know that the person would appreciate them and if you\u2019re not totally an expert, which you may be. But I would never give something homemade without knowing that the person or a couple would appreciate it.", "I would be over the moon with a hand made blanket. It would literally be my my favourite present.", "NTA.  People who think knit/crochet is \"cheap\" have zero idea what they're talking about.", "My husband\u2019s grandfather made us a quilt for our wedding and that was my favorite gift of them all. She is gone now but I still appreciate the love and time she put into the gift. Hopefully your brother and sister in law will also appreciate the time you put into making the blanket. I actually rescue crochet blankets from thrift stores because it pains me to see them there knowing a lot of time went into making them. NTA", "NTA a couple of my most pride possessions are handmade, crocheted and sewn, blankets from family. Your, I'm guessing, 18 year old friends have little to zero experience in gift giving so what do they know.", "NTA! My favorite wedding gift I got was an embroidery my husbands aunt made for us. I still have it hung on the wall almost 6 years later", "NTA- you know your brother appreciates your handmade works. Take note of all those who are making comments against handicrafts and never waste a moment of time or consideration on making them anything.", "NTA. Pop on over to r/crochet for some community support, too!", "NTA buuuuuuuuut would your brother and his fiance like having a blanket like that? Not everyone does. I would honestly just check in with them about it.", "NTA. Your friends are idiots. The bride and groom will get more use out of your present than any other they will get", "YWNBTA - A lot of people treasure handmade gifts far above anything off the registry.  My MIL brought a crocheted blanket for my son and my new DIL last year when they had their ceremony.  We actually brought it to their house because it was super bulky and my DIL cried over it because she wasn't raised to be a \"maker\" and to have something made specifically for her meant the world to her.", "NTA!! a crocheted blanket is a great idea! what is wrong with your friends?  who doesnt like or need blankets?", "NTA at all! A handmade blanket is an amazing and thoughtful gift. We have a few crocheted blankets around and are always reminded of the person who gave them to us and the occasion when we use them. \n\nPlease don\u2019t let your friends opinions discourage you. They\u2019ll someday be older and wiser and recognize what a great gift it really is.", "NTA. My aunt crocheted us a blanket for our wedding 25 years ago.  Still use it and love it.   My grandma crocheted me an afghan 50 years ago...my most treasured possession.  Your friends don't know what they're talking about.", "NTA. I think a lot of people underestimate the amount of time and money that go into crochet blankets.\nWe have two made of the super soft baby yarn that my sister made - she worked on them for months and they\u2019re by far the coziest and my favourite blankets to use on the couch (especially for the cold winter months, or when i\u2019m sick.) \nIf your brother and future sibling-in-law are not super materialistic people, like you implied in your post, then i\u2019m sure they\u2019ll love something handmade and appreciate the hard work, time, and money you put into it.", "NTA - I crochet and it\u2019s not a cheap gift. It\u2019s a warm and thoughtful gift and your brother and SIL sound like the kind of people to appreciate such a sweet gift.", "Your friends are materialistic and immature. I\u2019d be so disappointed if my sister just got me something off the registry. It means so much to be given a handmade present, let alone a high quality one.", "NTA btw.", "I would be honored to have a homemade blanket as a wedding gift. That something that I would use on a regular basis and think of all the fun we had at the reception!\n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s a lovely, loving gift.", "NTA - fellow crochet crafter here. I know what it takes to make a full crochet afghan. What you're doing takes time, patience, and skill, not to mention the price of yarn. Your time spent doing this is part of the value, don't discount that. \n\nBut most of all, you are putting love into it, and you can't buy that with an extra place setting.", "I am the biggest blanket person I know (my late mom used to gift me blankets at every occasion and sometimes just cause it was Tuesday lol) and my absolute favorites are the crochet blankets!!!!  To me, not only are you NTA but you\u2019re a total rockstar for being able to make and gift them something this awesome!!  \n\nSidebar: am I 16 years too late to ask for my wedding gift from you?? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Test the waters with your brother and his fiance, ask if they want something specific or something personal, and then make your decision.", "My husband still has the blanket his great aunt crocheted for him, and she passed on forty years ago and we both love and use it regularly. Hand made gifts are the best!", "NTA. My freshman year of college I got a blanket mom had crocheted for me for Christmas. I still have it.", "Nta. Ignore your stupid friends that have no heart. The newlyweds will treasure this gift forever. It will hopefully become a family heirloom.", "I would have loved to receive that, and it would provide be the only present I would have kept all these years", "NTA\n\nI crochet. If you know your brother and future SIL appreciate homemade gifts, make the blanket. The sweet sentimentality behind it makes it a *perfect* wedding gift, and in my opinion, nothing beats a knit or crocheted blanket in coziness. (I\u2019d honestly nix the fabric backing because I prefer the texture of the stitches, but that\u2019s just me.)\n\nThe only thing I have to ask, OP\u2026 Did you budget enough time to have the blanket ready to gift by the wedding? They can take a while to make.", "NTA! I received a few crocheted blankets at my wedding band I still treasure them! Your friend are still young and too immature to understand how a hand crafted blanket is worth so much more", "It's an awesome gift. Don't listen to your friends. I'm sure they will love it.", "NTA. My very favourite wedding gift is a chip/dip set that someone handmade for us. It\u2019s the only thing I specifically remember who gave it to us, and I use it all the time. Your friends sound very young/immature. Your mom is right, they will love the blanket!", "I (60 M)  have a blanket my grandmother crocheted for me when I was born.  My mother crocheted one for me when I moved out and my grandmother also crocheted one for when my wife and I got married. They are still treasured.  Our daughter has one that my mom made when she was born.  Putting time and effort (as well as significant material cost) into a gift is far more meaningful and will be far more appreciated by most than a toaster off the registry.  Or a random gift where there is no registry.  Don't let anyone tell you different", "When you make something yourself and it takes a lot of time, it shows that you care.  Anything that takes a lot of time and effort should be recognized as such by the recipient.", "NTA. You are literally wrapping them up in your love! It's such a sweet and thoughtful gift.\n\nI'm decades older than you and some of my most treasured possessions are handmade blankets I've been gifted through the years.", "NTA. I got married last year. My husband\u2019s coworker made us the most beautiful crocheted blanket as a gift. I was SO touched someone would take so much time and effort to make a gift. It was a beautiful piece of work. Unless your brother or SIL are jerks that demand a fancy gift (this would make them AHs), they will be very pleased with such a thoughtful gift. Go for it. Your friends are being silly.", "NTA.  This will be a unique special gift where you have out a lot of thought and effort into making.  It\u2019s not just the cost of the yarn but the hours that go into making the blanket.  Ignore your friends, this is something that they will cherish forever.", "NTA. As a fellow crocheter, I know exactly how much time (and love) go into a project like this!\n\nYou mentioned that you have already made your brother several hats because he likes them. He will absolutely LOVE this!\n\nThe takeaway here is don\u2019t make anything for your friends because they will not appreciate it.", "I think that is a great gift. I still have the blanket my grandmother crocheted for me 30 years ago. \nNTA", "Best.Present.Ever. NTA.", "NTA. my parents have a beautiful white blanket/quilt with their names and wedding date embroidered in. it\u2019s so beautiful and one of my mother\u2019s most prized possessions.

I think a blanket, and a handmade one at that, is a great wedding gift. your friends were quite rude to shut you down.", "Nta.\n\nMy cousin and grandmother crocheted me an afghan for our bed for my wedding gift. It is easily the most favorite gift we received. We use it all the time. And it is one of the few gifts we were given thar we actually do use on a regular basis.\n\nDon't listen to your friends.", "NTA - but a word of caution to be sure it is something they would appreciate and be prepared to accept it may get tossed into a box never to see the light of day.  I've seen too many posts, where people throw out custom crochet or quilts because it didn't fit their \"aesthetic\".", "NTA. It\u2019s a good bet your brother knows exactly how much time, effort and love you put in to your work.

It is more about the time and care you have taken out of love and respect for their relationship. You thought of each thing that would appeal to them and also practical use. You selected to yarn and the plans to incorporate designs. All of these things take time and care. \n\nThen you will spend hours making this blanket. Each stitch will be done with care and love. You are spending way more than $80, this gift to me would be priceless. It sounds like you have a great relationship with your brother, I cannot imagine that he and his fianc\u00e9 will not feel the same way.

They have no idea the time, care, love, and thought that goes into a gift like that. You\u2019re not just brainlessly buying a toaster off a registry because it was your favorite thing within your budget. Bought items come and go, but your gift is timeless and a love they\u2019ll have in their home forever. If the couple had indicated a dislike for crochet items in the past then perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be a good gift, however, since you\u2019ve indicated how much your brother loves your hats, I\u2019m sure he and his future wife will be incredibly appreciative of a crocheted blanket for their wedding.", "Some people appreciate the thought, time and effort that goes into a handmade gift... and some don't. Your friends are clearly in the latter group. That's ok, everyone has different preferences. Your brother has enjoyed things you've made for him before and your mum agrees that it is a lovely gift for them. She knows your brother a lot better than your friends do, most likely. Listen to her! Gifts like that become valuable, treasured possessions, passed down to new generations even. Especially if it has something on it showing the occasion it was made for and who made it. (Like a label on your fabric backing.) \n\nI think it's especially clever of you to think of using a very soft acrylic instead of natural yarn.. 'cause I just am not there for that handwashing malarkey. :D Having it be machine washable is BOSS. \n\nSo very NTA.", "NTA I have wedding gifts from my registry but I don't think about them every day, I have three gifts that are personalized and I see two of them every day and love them your friends don't understand that but your family will love it.", "NTA. I think a blanket made by you is a wonderful gift. It\u2019s so thoughtful and a lot of hard work. I graduated from high school over 40 years ago.

A blanket that is made by you by hand is very thoughtful.  I would love such a wedding gift. To give you an idea of some of my favorite gifts....one of my friends did me a crochet blanket for Christmas 5 years ago. I cherish it especially because she made it with colors she knew I would love. My other friend also started crochet 3 years ago and she gave me a scarf .... her first ever. I always wear it. Every winter all winter.  These are gifts that matter. Those made from the heart that are useful and take into account the personal taste of those you give them to. I think they will love your gift. \n\n\nBy the way, I just started to crochet a blanket. My first ever. It's soooooooooooo long. And it looks awful lol but I am making it for my husband and he says he lovessssss it.", "NTA \n\nI crochet, and as other people have said, your friends don't know squat about what they're talking about. I've made my mom/family members blankets, and not once have they ever been unappreciated. Every single one is displayed either on a bed or a chair. A wedding is a perfect occasion for a handmade gift. People don't understand that crochet is an art form, takes a lot of time and practice, and is highly sentimental for many folks out there receiving or making things themselves.", "NTA, maybe get a little extra of the yarn to trim baby blankets with if you think they'll have kids.", "NTA and can you make me one?", "NTA and your friends are all wrong. A handmade blanket, made with love, will be treasured forever. It's sounds like an incredibly thoughtful gify", "NTA My mother-in-law gave me a hand crocheted banket for Christmas a few months after I married her son. She put so much time and love into making it and it was beautiful. When hubby and I parted ways, I took that blanket! It isn't ONLY the monetary value, it's the time, love and thought you put into creating something SPECIFICALLY FOR someone special to you.  It is a gift that is SO MUCH MORE valuable than a china platter or espresso machine off the registry. ANYBODY can purchase something on the registry, NOT EVERYONE has the talent, patience, care and skill to create a ONE OF A KIND ITEM made especially for a loved one. I tried taking up crochet during the pandemic, my mom made some great blankets and throws and taught me how a long time ago...BUT, I am just not good at it. I can NEVER get the tension right, it's tight, it's loose, the stitches turn out bigger or smaller...I have NEVER been able to master it no matter how long I practice. Macrame, on the other hand, that's my vibe. I made some really cool plant hangers, wall hangings, belts and even a small handbag that all turned out great.  \n\nSo even if someone WANTS to take up something like crochet, quilting, or macrame, some hobbies are just not suitable for a particular person. So you rock that blanket and tell your \"friends\" it isn't their call.  I don't know where those people are from, but someone that considers handcrafting a blanket for your brother a bad idea has no clue about how QUALITY things are created. Hand crafted items are AMAZING and in this day and age, rather difficult to find. If you were to go out and try to BUY a hand crocheted blanket, once you actually FIND one to buy,  you are going to pay several HUNDRED DOLLARS for it because it was NOT mass produced by a machine in a factory.", "NTA \nMy favorite gifts from my wedding were the two throws I received. \nOne was crocheted by one of my Grandmothers - she made one for each grandchild when we were born and they were given to us when we got married (my youngest cousin got his this year and he cried b/c our Grandmother passed away 5 years ago and he thought he would never get \u201chis blanket\u201d). \nThe other one was a blanket quilt made up of squares that represented both my husband and I \u2026 things from our childhood to adulthood to our relationship.  This was great because she had listened to stories and even contact his Mom for things that were significant.  \n\nWe have used these blankets so often that they are super soft and snuggly.

I have possession of that amazing quilt and throw from ladies I never got to meet. That's what is so cool about handmade quality products. This isn't \"just\" a blanket. It's something made with love, and because you are making it machine washable, it will be *used* and if they have kids, likely something they'll put on the floor for baby to crawl on. Or to place over their little family when watching movies. Someday, that kid might say \"hey mom and dad, since you're getting new furniture and redecorating, can I have the throw that aunt gave you for your wedding day?\" And it will go to their first apartment, be there in the first home when they get married, and their baby will crawl on it.

I think trying to attach the backing fabric to it will be my biggest problem.", "Thank you! I'll think about posting a picture closer to when it is done. I still have a lot of time and I am not the fastest when it comes to crocheting!", "I appreciate your kind words. It is taking me quite awhile since I am not the fastest crocheter out there which is why I wanted to start it so much time in advance. As for my friends I do think they can be a little too focused on materialistic things but it is also a little hard due to being the youngest in the friend group to push back sometimes.", "I've never actually made a blanket before but I have made my brother hats and my FSIL once asked me to crochet her a cardigan to replace one she ripped a couple years ago. That's why I thought a blanket might be a good gift.", "Thank you for the suggestion! I will probably include a card along with the materials its made of just in case any guests have trouble with acrylic. I'm going to make sure in big letters that they know they can just toss it in the washer and dryer without a care because both absolutely detest hand washing things.", "Thanks for your reply. As for the acrylic yarn I have made my brother hats out of acrylic and my FSIL once asked me to make her a cardigan which she chose black acrylic yarn when I went with her so neither has a problem with it. It sucks that you have issues with that! I'll probably check that with people in the future if I gift other projects though.", "I\u2019ve started picking up the crocheted blankets at thrift stores and garage sales. When I showed my daughter one I\u2019d gotten, she said she really needed some for her living room. She was super excited when I found one at a garage sale later that week. When I showed my other daughter the one I\u2019d picked up for her sister, SHE said she needed some. One can never have too many blankets!", "Thank you for the judgement. My brother and FSIL are both fine with acrylic although I never took into account any guests who would come over and have issues with touching a throw blanket if they sat on the couch.", "My grandmother, bless her, had severe Alzheimer\u2019s and sewed. Yes. Sewed me a simple blanket of fleece and satin ribbon edging as a teen. She died in 2017. I have kept it and repaired it (it was the first thing I ran through my sewing machine after Christmas one year). I often used it as a small blanket to keep warm on the loveseat while on my phone or watching tv. \n\nIt got a second life of sorts when my nephew loved it as a toddler, long after we put it in the hall closet. It\u2019s hot pink with flowers on it. He never wanted any other blanket at grandmas, that was his blanket and he loved it. You couldn\u2019t get it away from him. I had 0 problems sharing.\n\nI have a couple pieces that mean the world since some of the people involved with those pieces are no longer with us. \n\nOP\u2019s friends are just dumb and don\u2019t understand the value of what OP is giving.", "A crocheted blanket sounds is a fabulous gift. I would have loved one for a gift for my wedding.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are feeling insecure about it you could add a gift card for their favourite take out, a bottle of wine, some nice candles or a scent they enjoy and put it in a hamper for the evening after their wedding. Then they can have a relaxing treat on the sofa the evening after the big day. Cuddle together with a glass of wine, under a handmade blanket opening cards and laughing at Uncle Barry's dad dancing or whatever.", "I just wanted to add, my parents have next to none of their wedding gifts anymore but the do have this brown scratchy wool blanket my mom's friend made for their wedding. It's a focal point in the living room 40 years after the fact! They still use it and talk about it all the time. Its something meaningful and timeless, and I think anyone who has a crocheted blanket also knows they are the warmest things of life and are soo incredibly useful. My parents would put it over my blanket as a kid to keep me extra warm, we all love it.", "I mean, sure, but how many of them actually know your older brother or his fiancee that well? Or at all? Unless they're family of the bride or your older brother's best friend or something you're better off listening to the person who is  in a better position to know whether or not they'll be appreciative of a handmade gift (your mom).", "Your friends would be very surprised at how much hand-made blankets/  throws/quilts go for in the secondary marker and there are plenty of customers willing to pay! They will definitely cherish the gift (my fav blankets are the ones my late aunt made over 20 yrs ago & they are still in great shape). Besides, there is no wedding registry so they prob have basic stuff already. Sunflowersandbees made some great suggestions of adding a nice bottle of wine, etc.. Enjoy the wedding!", "You\u2019re 18, no one should expect you to spend a fortune for a wedding gift and a blanket is a very thoughtful gift.", "Forget trying to get anyone else's approval. Why do you care? You already know that the couple loves the stuff you've made for them.", "No need to talk to your friends about it.  This gift is from you, not them.  Listen to your mother (and internet strangers)...it's a perfect gift", "Moo point!", "In the future? Yes. Take into consideration if the recipient would like a handmade gift before you start. They could enjoy such a gift but on a smaller scale, who knows?\n\nRight now? Nope-a-diddly-doo. You know your brother a lot better than your friends ever will. Talking to your friends again about this will only create more confusion for you, bc they will keep thinking what they're thinking, and meantime while you're doubting yourself you will likely not put the same effort in crocheting the blanket.\n\nNTA", "I have several crocheted and quilted blankets from fam and friends and I cherish them. I am older however (gen X) so I can't speak to the younger generations.  I have read though that some of the younger generations just aren't into antiques and family heirlooms which is kind of the same thing IMO. But that is definitely a generalization.  We need to keep these types of skills alive and going. If your bro loves the hats etc he will definitely like the blanket especially since you are making it big enough for him! Perfect for Sunday afternoon naps on the couch. Keep crocheting!", "Maybe share fewer things that show your maturity (because you are definitely more thoughtful and mature than those friends)? You're doing great, Crochet Woman!", "Please know that your friends are wrong. Lots of people out there, including your brother and sister in law, appreciate the time, effort, and care that go into knitting and crocheting projects. You absolutely made the right choice of gifts. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly generous and meaningful to spend so many hours of your precious free time to make something with love. You took into account looks, softness, ease of care\u2026everything. \n\nIf that isn\u2019t the most fitting gift for a newly joined couple starting their journey together I don\u2019t know what is. \n\nYour family sounds amazing.

It sound like you may have outgrown your friends in maturity despite the chronological order of age.\n\nETA crocheting", "Awesome to include the part about putting in the laundry!  And that\u2019s nice to include the materials as well.  They\u2019re going to love it", "Acrylic yarn is great and extremely durable since it can\u2019t be attacked by moths. Baby clothes I crocheted long ago for my children are still in good enough condition for my kids, who are now adults, to use for THEIR babies.\n\nI have made crocheted wedding presents, including placemats fur my niece and bride and groom dolls for one of my daughters, that were greatly appreciated. We also have a lovely crocheted bed set made by my husband\u2019s grandmother that is a family heirloom. \n\nHowever there are some people who don\u2019t appreciate the time, love and cost of yarn and your work. Don\u2019t let these naysayers stop you from following your passion! It would be wise to make sure you select colors that go with your brother\u2019s decor and I\u2019m sure he and his bride will appreciate the ease of caring for acrylic yarn!\n\nAlso put a nice border to give the blanket a finished look. That can also help hide any little mistakes such as uneven edges.", "Then you'll do fine! And thank you.", "So I missed the part that you made hats for your brother before his love them. If you know that he\u2019d like something that you made, and I think it\u2019s fine. I just find that many people give homemade gifts really are an expert at what they do, and haven\u2019t considered with the person might want. But it sounds like you\u2019re in better shape than I thought. And I am reacting as someone who can\u2019t have acrylic or even polyester near my skin or wear it, or even have it in my skin so while I might appreciate the thought of a gift like this, I would never be able to use it", "I love this, but to reiterate - you know your brother, OP. It sounds to me like your friends are just more materialistic than your family - and they aren\u2019t really assholes for this, much as I want to say they are! But your gift sounds lovely all on its own. \n\nSome of my aunts made baby blankets for my kids. We got a ton of baby gifts but those are the ones that we still have, even now that my kids aren\u2019t babies anymore. People remember how much you care when you put that much work into a gift!", "Some great ideas!", "More info. It depends. It\u2019s a wonderful thought but is it something they will actually want and use or is it something you want to do. do you know what colors will work in their home?  Are you ok with them not loving or using it?  I love handmade gifts. I find crochet and knitted blankets gorgeous. I would however never want one. I find most acrylic yarn itchy but also I have pets.

My friend carved some weird wedding spoon for my husband and I for our wedding and it\u2019s our favorite present. A blanket is an amazing gift!", "NTA - sounds like your friends are clueless about what a true afghan blanket can be. I highly doubt you\u2019re just making rows and rows of double crochet knots. If you think your brother and fianc\u00e9 will love it, chances are you\u2019re correct. And that blanket will become a family treasure compared to a household item likely discarded along the way.", "To me absolutely NTA.

Handmade gifts are wonderful.", "NTA.\nSide eyeing your friends for not wanting a blanket. Hand made is so precious. I have one my great grandmother made. It\u2019s ugly but loved so so much. My baby was given handmade items from older family members and they are so precious. Little jumpers and blankets and even a doll.", "NTA your friends are to young to know any better. It's a very thoughtful gift.", "NTA your friends don't know what they're talking about.", "Having done crafts for the majority of my life, including crocheting and knitting, your blanket would probably end up costing more than most of the gifts!  I made myself a blanket with that was easily $70 using slightly better than average yarn. And that's not including the time and labor that goes into it. Please don't be embarrassed because people told you your gift was \"cheap\" or \"a waste\". They have no appreciation and understanding of the love and effort that goes into a gift like yours. It's a one of a kind gift. NTA!", "Your friends are idiots. But seriously, your thoughtfulness that has been put into this gift so far is worth all the money in the world.  This is a generous and loving gift; not to mention one that takes time and craftsmanship. \n\nYou are NTA.  Far from it OP.", "NTA and your friends are just young and clueless.  My daughter's friend is getting married and invited not only us, but also my elderly mother....and the bride hinted that she would love a handmade blanket.

Guess what a lot of people enjoy getting. If you guessed handmade blankets, you win! Lol, no, seriously, people who have gotten something crocheted from me love it, including the cats. Right now, my little one's favorite blanket is the one I made for my SO. I am making another just for the baby. I make more than blankets and haven't heard a complaint from any of the items I have made.", "I was 19 when my older sister got married. I was the maid of honor in name only, because how was I supposed to host a bridal shower in my dorm room, with no job? I did what I could, and for their present I spent close to 100 hours painting a big portrait of their first dance. And thus began my tendonitis, hours spent with teeny paintbrushes. It's something she still treasures (I hope). \n\nOlder siblings should understand you don't have money for things off the registry. And putting your time and talent into something homemade is equally as thoughtful. NTA", "I'm literally looking at the quilt my best friend's mom made for my wedding gift.

This is very sweet and thoughtful,  but personally, I would hate getting something like this. It's not my style at all, and if someone close to me got it for me, I'd feel obligated to keep it even though I dislike it.

NTA at all.", "NTA It's a lovely, personal, and very thoughtful wedding present.\n\n\nYour friends might not realize it yet, but every couple is different, and while some expect and only want extravagant presents, others will absolutely treasure homemade and/or cheap ones too. Personally, I'd be over the moon with joy if someone gifted me a crochet blanket they had made themselves.", "Wow, your friends are clueless and immature. Crocheting and knitting are skills.

I'm sure they'll appreciate the gift the way it's supposed to be. And save yourself the time and trouble by not making anything for your friends.", "NTA. This is an AMAZING gift.  Who in their right mind wouldn't be thrilled with a handmade blanket?!! Something like this is so much more \"extravagant\" than something off a registry because it's so personal and so much time goes into it. The yarn alone is not cheap, but please please please don't undervalue the time and care you're putting into this gift. It will have so much more value and meaning than something you buy in a store. And honestly, anyone who wouldn't appreciate such a thoughtful gift maybe doesn't deserve a gift at all . . . \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f?\n\nI was given a hand quilted blanket from my great-grandmother (one she and her quilting group worked on) for my wedding and I still treasure it over 23 years later.

I think the blanket is a beautiful gift. Your friends are assholes. If your budget allows, and you want to add to it, maybe fold it nicely and put it in a basket with some cute popcorn containers, some candy, add in a movie, even a $25 gift card to grub hub, whatever works for your budget. Wrap it in clear plastic like a gift basket and put a cute little tag on it that says \u201cFirst Movie Night for Mr and Mrs Lastname\u201d (or something cuter than that check pinterest)! Honestly depending on what your budget and resources allowed you could put together a really cool gift basket for very little money. \n\nHonestly though, I think the blanket deserves to stand on its own, maybe with a beautiful note about how you made it. That\u2019s a gift many people would cherish for their whole lifetime. It\u2019s not about the cost of the yarn, it\u2019s about the time and effort and love that you put into it.", "People literally register for blankets.

It\u2019s a sweet gift and I don\u2019t know anyone in their 20s who doesn\u2019t like having an extra blanket. Also the time and love put into that blanket will speak volumes to your brother and his wife because making something like that takes so much effort from a person. And to quell and potential worry you might have left, most the time wedding presents aren\u2019t even opened until the next day or after the honeymoon, so there\u2019s pretty much no way a gift is going to ruin someone\u2019s wedding. And when you don\u2019t have a registry, it means gifts are not a high priority for the couple and they will simply appreciate whatever folks get them. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure your mom knows what your brother would appreciate more than your friends!

They should be a reminder of the love you have for the person you're giving them to.", "Holy crap NTA at all. If I got something like that, especially at a wedding, I'd probably cry tears of joy and gratitude that someone literally spent hours making it for me. Not only are you giving up a crap ton of your time, but you're making it machine washable?? That's a dream.

NAH here. Look, some people appreciate handmade gifts. Some people do not.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the materials are expensive, or if there was a certain amount of labor put in. Not everyone cares about that. Some people just see the end result and would rather have a store-bought version.\n\nBlankets are for some people, very personal. They may only like a specific type of fabric, or color, or size. Not everyone sees all blankets equal, and are very picky on what they like. They very well may already have enough blankets that they like.\n\nYour blanket very well could end up just being a gift that they either never use or end up throwing/giving away. It could very well be useless.\n\nThere's also a big difference between specifically asking for a sweater due to one being ruined, vs being randomly given a blanket as a wedding gift.\n\nYour friends aren't wrong for saying blankets aren't a great wedding gift, and you're not wrong for wanting to make something nice for your brother and SIL.\n\nBut this is really something that should be discussed prior.

That blanket is one of my most precious possessions.

We have a gigantic, intricate, king-sized blanket knitted by my older son\u2019s great-great aunt that is precious to me. \n\nYour friends don\u2019t understand that the love your time and effort shows is what makes a gift like that special.  Your brother and SIL will love it.", "NTA. Your friends are idiots. My grandma wanted to go to Europe. My grandpa did not as he hates long travel, foreigners & touristy shit. She thought maybe I'd like to go. I kid you not, she asked every single friend of mine she came into contact with, my mom, my dad, her friends, my sister. Everyone said, no, he'd want to go with his friends, why would he want to go with his grandma? So she finally asked me & we went to Europe. Ps id love a nice handmade blanket like this", "Unless you craft or grew up with crafty parents, kids and teens rarely know the true value of handmade items. Anyone can buy a toaster or photo frames. Your blanket will be a welcomed gift that I am sure will be passed on to future generations. As someone tall I would love a throw that I can actually throw over myself and not play tug of war. NTA and for the record most don't expect much in the way of gifts from a teen at weddings so the fact that you are putting so much time and effort truly shows how much you love your brother.", "NTA at all. My sister and mom have both crocheted me blankets and they are my 2 favorite blankets. I am actually laying with one right now. This is an amazing gift and they will love it. I would even see if you could add their last name to it somehow.", "NTA. Even if they don\u2019t like you\u2019re not an a-hole. It\u2019s a thoughtful gift with a lot of love put into it.", "I say ask your brother and his fiance about it.

You can give whatever gift you please.", "NTA, but now you have a glimpse of the values some of your friends hold.

We rarely drink alcohol and almost never wine. \n\n\nWe do still use the quilt we were given though.", "Fellow crafter here and I am very surprised that more people haven't said the same thing you are. Sometimes it doesn't matter how much money is spent on the materials or how much time you put into it. If you don't 100% know the recipient would love it, I wouldn't even consider sinking so much into a project. Certainly not a large blanket.\n\nI have been gifted a few items from other crafters. I know exactly how much time and skill it takes to make some of these items, but no one bothered to ask me if it was even something I would use or wear. And I'm sorry, I'm not going to wear a silly hat in colors I hate just because someone spent a month working on it, and it was a complicated pattern. I'm also not going to use an ugly patterned quilt in a color I hate. If it's for me, then please please check with me first, or at least take the time to examine my preferences and taste. \n\nOP's blanket might be gorgeous and her brother may love it. We have no way of knowing and I haven't seen anything from her that indicates whether brother likes her hats or not. All she said was that she makes them for him.

It's so thoughtful and personal <3 NTA, sweetest gift imo.", "My husband and I still have a blanket made by his step-mother close to 20 years ago, holding onto it through many moves and cleaning purges.\n\nThose people apparently don't know the real value of a hand-made gift, and that's such a sad thing to hear.\n\nDoes the couple getting married?  That's a bigger question.  Do they value handcrafted works of art like this?", "Just stop asking about it. You don't need her approval for the gift you're giving your brother. I would love a blanket!", "Why do you care so much what your friend thinks? You\u2019re not making the blanket for her.", "If one of my friends made me a crocheted, well, anything, I would treasure it forever. None of them would because they\u2019re all lame and don\u2019t know how to crochet (just kidding). But it would be amazing!!!", "More like an udder disaster.", "We only have a few wedding gifts that are still treasured and used in our home. One is a crochet blanket my aunt (who has since passed away) made and the other is a cedar chest a friend made and my brother paid for. Personal gifts like that are treasured. Your friends may not realize it yet though, so don't worry about their advice. Crocheting is an amazing skill to have and can make other wonderful gifts. I still have the doll my great grandma made crocheted for me as a little girl. It's stored in the cedar chest. \ud83d\ude01", "!!! They will definitely love the blanket.", "Ask them. There is a very big difference between a cardigan that was ruined vs a blanket. Has he worn the hats frequently? Has either of them actually expressed interest in a blanket?", "This is what I'd really like to know. I'm a crafter as well, so I can recognize and appreciate the time and quality of the materials, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I'll want it in my house.\n\nWe have other crafters in my family, and one of them gifted my parents a queen sized quilt. Months of work. I'm sure she very thoughtfully laid out the fabrics, etc. But the quilt color and style are nothing that my parents ever would have picked for themselves, so the quilt has never been used.\n\nI also have a friend who crochets all the time. She spent a ton of time working on a very detailed, complicated hat pattern and gifted it to me for Christmas. I've never worn it, and the style was nothing like anything I have ever worn.\n\nSo here's my takeaway: before anyone decides to make a handmade item that takes MONTHS of work and invested materials, talk about it with the recipient to see if it's something they would even want. They might love it. They might love the pattern but hate the colors you would've picked. Don't put yourself in a position where both parties are hurt by a well intended gesture for lack of communication, and the final product is wasted.", "Everything about this. My aunt crochets, and one year she made me a gorgeous winter set for Christmas. Scarf, gloves, hat, earmuffs, etc.\n\nSuper sweet gesture of her and I knew it took her hours and was expensive. But I hate it. It's colors I never wear, in styles I find bothersome. And I only ever put it on when she's around but otherwise it's shoved in the back of my closet.\n\nOP really needs to have a discussion with them on if this is actually something that they want, especially since it's supposed to be a gift. Otherwise it could become a bigger issue down the road.", "NTA. Handmade items stay with people for a long time. My 65 yo dad still has the afghans his grandma made in his bed.

It's a beautiful gift", "NTA\n\nPersonalized gifts are the best gifts.", "NTA\nA friend of mine\u2019s mother knitted a blanket for my wife and i for our wedding, we love it and use it every night. Its the thought and time she put into it, and its heavy so its great in the winter. We love it.", "NTA, I would absolutely love to receive a gift like this.   It is truly a gift from the heart.

Ignore what your friends are saying!", "NTA\n.. it depends a lot on the recipient.  If it was me, I would love it.

When you are close to someone it's ok to get their opinion at risk of spoiling the surprise.", "Definitely NTA! It's a fantastic gift because it is useful and also something that you put a ton of effort and care into. \n\nWhen my sister got married, two of my aunts made a large quilt for their bed (they are both accomplished quilters, and it turned out beautifully).

NTA", "NTA I was just talking to my wife about it and we both agreed that would be one of the best presents we could have gotten from someone. It seems like you've put a good amount of thought into all the variables. Keep truckin!", "It sounds like you have a pretty good relationship with your bro and his fiance. Since crochet is time-consuming and you don't want to mis-step, honestly I'd just message them/talk to them and say that you're thinking of making them a custom blanket/couch-throw for a wedding gift, and wanted to check in advance if it'd be welcomed, or if they'd rather have something else. \n\nI crochet too and have done quite large projects as gifts, and I almost always ask before I begin. I don't tell them every detail of stitch and colour, but I check that the item is wanted and practical. It's no fun to spend 50+ hours on a gift and find out the recipient would rather have a set of coffee mugs. \n\nI hope they love whatever you end up gifting! I personally really hope they go for your blanket, it sounds like you've put a lot of love and thought into it already.", "You're 18.

I'd ignore their unqualified comments.   I'm a pretty high end interior designer.  We commission handmade items all the time because they are unique, a sign of craft and gorgeous in a way that no machine made object can be.  Even better:  it is being made with love.   Your brother is very lucky and you also, btw, chose right regarding the colors.", "NTA. I had a giant chunky blanket on our wedding registry and it was pricy. You know one of the best gifts we got? The handmade wooden cutting board from my brother. I\u2019m keeping that forever.", "NTA. At all. Crocheting is time consuming and it's not a really cheap hobby depending on supplies. I think this is a beautiful gift idea. But I come from a long line of women who crochet so there's that too.", "NTA - your friends are being fools, calling it a cheap gift \ud83d\ude14.

As a fellow crocheter,  I have to say that is a great gift!! But I am one for homemade gifts over store bought ones.  You stated that your brother loves it when you crochet him stuff, so I think this is a great gift idea! Plus, and tell your friends this, you are giving them an excuse to be close while on the couch together.  I know how much work you are putting into this, you are an awesome sister!

In which case, what's it called cuz I want to learn!", "NTA - in fact, you're a sweetheart!\n\nHandmade gifts are always appreciated more than just throwing money at an impersonal registry. I'm glad to see someone so young have crochet as a hobby. Your friends are young too, they don't know how much work you're going to be putting into something they will probably use all the time. Don't listen to your friends about this.\n\nYou've only given yourself a year for a blanket for a tall man? You best get hooking!", "NTA.  First of all, you are 18 and not 28 or 38 so no one reasonable would expect some expensive gift off of the registry from you and given your budget, no one not an idiot would want a set of forks (which is all you could afford off some expensive registry anyway!) rather than a blanket crocheted with love.  You are investing much more than someone who merely throws easily earned money at an impersonal gift.  Good for you!!!", "NTA. I took up crocheting for a while. The money you have and will spend on the materials + the hours you will put into making this blanket will make it just as valuable as any other gift that can be bought from a store or online registry. It may be even more valuable because it is hand-made from a family member, and that adds sentimental value. Crocheting can be \"easy\" once you learn the basics, but it takes a lot of work to make bigger projects. \n\nDon't listen to your friends. You know your brother and future SIL best. You clearly care about them and you're putting time, money, and care into this gift. Your brother and future SIL will love it, and if for some reason they don't or can't use it, they will still appreciate it.", "NTA. These types of gifts are the ones that make you feel loved and appreciated", "NTA\n\nYour friends suck.\n\nIf your brother is tall, making a blanket will cover him from shoulders to over his feet will be a major hit.

Your friends have no idea what their talking about. You've made things for your brother that he loved and this is another.\nYou took time and thought of his and her decorating taste and style.  I'm pretty sure that this will be the best gift they get!", "NTA, and I would love and treasure a gift made so thoughtfully and lovingly by my sister/SIL.\n\nHOWEVER, I won't lie; some people would not. There are some AITA posts where the bride (it's almost always the bride) has a cow because someone made something beautiful, but the bride demands that a gift must come from their registry and be worth at least $x00. But those brides are always wrong about gift etiquette and are always the aholes. If either your brother or FSIL is more about how much people spend on them, then I would just buy them a gift.\n\nSince you say that your brother and SIL are \"not the kind of people who focus on \\[a wedding registry\\],\" I fully believe they are exactly the kind of people who would value and treasure such a beautiful handmade gift.\n\nYour friends are young and may be currently more into the brand name/label associated with a gift.\n\nThe money you spend on the materials and supplies for your gift is already a heft amount for a young adult to spend on a gift. It's a LOT! Then add in the value of your time, the gift becomes outrageously expensive - people spend hundreds for a quality handmade blanket. Then... then add in the very personal thought and care and love in every stitch you make. oooh. That is PRICELESS. You've put enough thought, that you know it will look lovely in their living room; you know it will feel comfortably soft and adequately cover your tall brother; you know it won't be too hard for them to keep it clean.

It is a lot more expensive than you make it out to be because you are pouring a lot of thought, care, and time for your gift and I couldn't think of anything sweeter.

Just because you say it\u2019s sentimental and that it was made with love \u2014 that emotion doesn\u2019t automatically or even necessarily translate to the receiver.
