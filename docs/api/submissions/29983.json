Ive payed the money on time every month. So recently she asked me to go find a better job so that I could help support the kid more and I told her I had no reason to get a better job since I already have everything I really want and dont feel like getting a more difficult job just so I can help her out. \n\nShe yelled at me for being a shitty father which is fair but I never wanted to be a father in general and shes the one who wanted to keep the kid so I dont think I should give up my personal lifestyle just to help with a kid I didnt want.", "created_utc": 1698670997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jswmx/aita_for_not_getting_a_better_job_so_that_i_can/", "score": 1079, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We also explained that having sex is an adult act with adult consequences. The main consequence being having a child, which is an 18 year commitment.\n\nBirth control protects both of you equally. You had sex, it failed, and now both of you are suffering the consequences of your actions. Why should she have to pay a higher price for an act you both performed? Is it your plan to work menial jobs for the next 18-26 years just to avoid paying child support? \n\nYou were man enough to fuck her, now be man enough to do the right thing.", "She sounds like one of those girls who believe that a father will fall in love with the child (and them) once the baby is born.\n\nNTA", "This type of situation highlights a very important assumption that different people view differently.  \n\n\nIf someone is hooking up and using birth control it's reasonable to assume they do not want a child, or at least are not wanting that sexual encounter to result in a child. I think we can all agree to that.  \n\n\nIf the birth control fails, what is the next action? Here is where the different assumptions come into play. Some people would think it's reasonable to assume that if birth control fails, an abortion is the reasonable next step. Clearly pregnancy was not wanted, so an abortion is the way to address failed birth control. Others would say that carrying the pregnancy to term is the reasonable assumption.  \n\n\nWhich assumption is most reasonable? Without communication on the topic what should one expect the outcome to me? For me, abortion seems the obvious choice. I'm assuming she didn't want the sex to result in pregnancy, so an abortion seems like the obvious step if birth control fails. Yes it has risks, but so does pregnancy. Obviously others do not think that's a reasonable assumption to make.  \n\n\nI have sympathy for everyone in situations such as this. Hooking up has so many risks and considerations. You may think at least on this one topic there is an obvious action, but there is no way to know if your partner agrees.", "NTA, she can get a job", "Nta while it is unfortunate you told her you didn\u2019t want to be a father and she went through with it anyway.

So being able to say no to men when the man wants more than the woman, why do we still fall back into that well of bull where its her body her choice.", "As a female that is strongly pro-choice, you're NTA. \n\nThere is an innate inequality when it comes reproductive choice. If a girl becomes pregnant and doesn't want to keep it but the guy does, she still has the choice to get an abortion if she chooses (granted I acknowledge it is not accessible to everyone, but that is a whole other issue.)\n\nIn the same vein, if a girl gets pregnant and wants to keep it but the guy doesn't, she has the choice to carry it to term. But if the guy makes it clear he wants no involvement outside of the legally mandated child support, that's his choice. \n\nIt was her choice to still carry that child to term knowing the father didn't want to be involved outside of what the law requires. Maybe she had this idea that once the child was born, you would have a change of heart. That's on her. \n\nAnyone who says \"If you don't want to have kids, never have sex\" are being obtuse. Anyone telling you to get a vasectomy is also obtuse. Maybe you want kids in the future with someone else, that's your right. You used protection and it failed. It happens and it sucks. But at the end of the day you are dealing with the consequences. \n\nPeople are ragging on you because you have a dad who is supporting most of your life expenses, as if that somehow makes you more beholden to contribute more in child support. You're lucky that your dad is able and wants to do that for you. Sure, it's unlucky that your biological child may not have that, but life's not fair.\n\nI don't blame you for not wanting work more when you don't have to. It allows you to focus on your schoolwork. If your dad decides he wants to keep helping with your living expenses after you are done with schoolwork, that's his choice and a win for you.\n\nIf you are going for your masters I assume that means one day you want a different job that isn't the job you are working right now. At that time, the courts will re-evaluate and adjust. It would be a different thing if you quit your job to avoid paying any support, but you aren't doing that. \n\nAlso, demanding someone get a better job doesn't automatically mean that that's possible. Maybe for your current schedule, this IS the best job that you can get that won't impact your schooling. Maybe a \"better\" job would require more hours than you can give. \n\nI feel for the child, I do, but there are tons of children out there who have biological fathers that \"go to the store for a pack of smokes and milk\" and never come back.

If he lives with his parents or in an apartment his parents own, his living expenses come down drastically.\n\n>OP is by literal legal definition lying about his income, even if dad does it because he loves OP the most. \n\nIn what world would that be counted as income?\n\n>It doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s no longer a gift, it\u2019s income\n\nNo it isn't. It doesn't become income because you say it is. Income is only what you earn. Not what is given to you.\n\n>and OP committed perjury for lying to the court and he is continuing to not take responsibility for his actions.\n\nAgain no evidence he lied to the court. He is taking responsibility for his actions as prescribed by the court.\n\n>Do I think OPs dad should pay for the kid? No, I think OP should and he should declare his income appropriately as is LEGALLY and morally required.\n\nHe is already declaring his legal income. Parents supporting their child is not income.", "Ive refused to take promotional exams to avoid having to do anymore than already do at this job. Not everyone is desperate to climb ranks", "His 0% timeshare negates any effect her earnings have on the child support calculation. So long as he has no timeshare, we will always pay the max amount based on his income. This is because the court assumes if mom has 100% timeshare, then she's paying for 100% of the expenses for raising a child. So in the court's eyes dad needs to take as much of the financial burden off her thathe can afford.", "Even with the lousy sex ed in schools, I assume OP would know how babies are made. If he didn't want to have a baby, why did he make one ?", "You are correct. That is the average amount for a year of infant care. I will edit my post.", "Maybe she lives in some regressive hell hole that prohibits that", "Where does it say, specifically in the post, that he made his intentions about having no involvement as a parent clear, if a pregnancy did arise from their hookup? Or did he wait until after they hooked up, and she discovered she was pregnant, to say he didn't want to have anything to do with it? Did neither of them discuss beforehand what might happen if their BC method failed? If not, seems both of them were too immature to be having sex in the first place. \n\nThat's sort of like closing the barn door after the horse ran out, as they say.", "Okay, that was a lot of words for \u201cI don\u2019t like the law.\u201d I don\u2019t care what you think it should be. I just explained exactly why daddy paying your every expense is still income according to the law. OP can be honest with the court or go to jail. That\u2019s beside the point for this sub though. He\u2019s also morally wrong, and therefore, the AH, and a massive one at that.", "Yep. I don\u2019t want my bosses job.", "This is a weird hill to die on mate.", "In the court's eyes, your income only goes up.  Doesn't matter if you get laid off the day after you get a raise - the raise shows what you 'could' earn therefore its what you owe.", "Pregnancy is always possible", "Im sorry but who hooks up just to have a kid?", "I was just replying to this part of your comment\n\n>What if she lives in a state where she can't get abortion care?\n\nOP says she chose to keep the child so this isn't the case, I'm not commenting on him being right or wrong.", "This one of the many reasons my husband has a government job.", "I mean what I spend in a month is less than my dad earns in a day from his business so he doesnt really care", "Yes that\u2019s true and while it\u2019s not an ideal situation to become a father when you didn\u2019t want to you are still in fact an AH if you refuse to get a higher paying job just to spite your child and their mother , especially when your dad pays all your bills so you have about 2K in disposable income every month. OP could very very easily afford to pay afew hundred more a month in child support, he just doesn\u2019t want to and in this economy with how expensive babies are $400 isn\u2019t much", "You\u2019re wasting your breath.", "It\u2019s infuriating. I watch my SO bust his ass to try and cover a CS payment that rivals what a doctor or lawyers CS payment would be, only for the child\u2019s mom to schedule him meet ups, exchanges, etc., just for him to sit at the agreed spot and wait for hours to be ignored and her response is basically like - *Fuck you, do something about it.* He has missed so much time and so many milestones, and god only knows what she tells the kid about why he doesn\u2019t see her, and knowing cops can\u2019t do anything and the court being so useless has emboldened her to an insane degree.\n\nShe knows nothing will be done, so why should she care?", "> It's not possible in this society as a man to elect to have sex and not risk being responsible for a child\n\nUh.  Just how limited and unimaginative do you think people\u2019s sex lives are?  There\u2019s a Whole Lot of ways to share really fun naked sweaty orgasms that do not involve a man sticking his penis into a possibly-fertile vagina.", "They have an equivalent. \n\nThey can also leave their infant at the fire station. Moron", "Condoms are pretty damn effective when used properly though. \n\nThere\u2019s also vasectomy? Like if you\u2019re really serious about not having kids, why not commit to that? Then you\u2019ll never have to worry about. It ever again", "Oh they do abandon, at alarming rates.  Read the post.  This OP did in fact ABANDON.", "Right?
