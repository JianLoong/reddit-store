Ive payed the money on time every month. So recently she asked me to go find a better job so that I could help support the kid more and I told her I had no reason to get a better job since I already have everything I really want and dont feel like getting a more difficult job just so I can help her out. \n\nShe yelled at me for being a shitty father which is fair but I never wanted to be a father in general and shes the one who wanted to keep the kid so I dont think I should give up my personal lifestyle just to help with a kid I didnt want.", "created_utc": 1698670997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jswmx/aita_for_not_getting_a_better_job_so_that_i_can/", "score": 523, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We also explained that having sex is an adult act with adult consequences. The main consequence being having a child, which is an 18 year commitment.\n\nBirth control protects both of you equally. You had sex, it failed, and now both of you are suffering the consequences of your actions. Why should she have to pay a higher price for an act you both performed? Is it your plan to work menial jobs for the next 18-26 years just to avoid paying child support? \n\nYou were man enough to fuck her, now be man enough to do the right thing.", "She sounds like one of those girls who believe that a father will fall in love with the child (and them) once the baby is born.\n\nNTA", "This type of situation highlights a very important assumption that different people view differently.  \n\n\nIf someone is hooking up and using birth control it's reasonable to assume they do not want a child, or at least are not wanting that sexual encounter to result in a child. I think we can all agree to that.  \n\n\nIf the birth control fails, what is the next action? Here is where the different assumptions come into play. Some people would think it's reasonable to assume that if birth control fails, an abortion is the reasonable next step. Clearly pregnancy was not wanted, so an abortion is the way to address failed birth control. Others would say that carrying the pregnancy to term is the reasonable assumption.  \n\n\nWhich assumption is most reasonable? Without communication on the topic what should one expect the outcome to me? For me, abortion seems the obvious choice. I'm assuming she didn't want the sex to result in pregnancy, so an abortion seems like the obvious step if birth control fails. Yes it has risks, but so does pregnancy. Obviously others do not think that's a reasonable assumption to make.  \n\n\nI have sympathy for everyone in situations such as this. Hooking up has so many risks and considerations. You may think at least on this one topic there is an obvious action, but there is no way to know if your partner agrees.", "NTA, she can get a job", "Nta while it is unfortunate you told her you didn\u2019t want to be a father and she went through with it anyway.

So being able to say no to men when the man wants more than the woman, why do we still fall back into that well of bull where its her body her choice.", "As a female that is strongly pro-choice, you're NTA. \n\nThere is an innate inequality when it comes reproductive choice. If a girl becomes pregnant and doesn't want to keep it but the guy does, she still has the choice to get an abortion if she chooses (granted I acknowledge it is not accessible to everyone, but that is a whole other issue.)\n\nIn the same vein, if a girl gets pregnant and wants to keep it but the guy doesn't, she has the choice to carry it to term. But if the guy makes it clear he wants no involvement outside of the legally mandated child support, that's his choice. \n\nIt was her choice to still carry that child to term knowing the father didn't want to be involved outside of what the law requires. Maybe she had this idea that once the child was born, you would have a change of heart. That's on her. \n\nAnyone who says \"If you don't want to have kids, never have sex\" are being obtuse. Anyone telling you to get a vasectomy is also obtuse. Maybe you want kids in the future with someone else, that's your right. You used protection and it failed. It happens and it sucks. But at the end of the day you are dealing with the consequences. \n\nPeople are ragging on you because you have a dad who is supporting most of your life expenses, as if that somehow makes you more beholden to contribute more in child support. You're lucky that your dad is able and wants to do that for you. Sure, it's unlucky that your biological child may not have that, but life's not fair.\n\nI don't blame you for not wanting work more when you don't have to. It allows you to focus on your schoolwork. If your dad decides he wants to keep helping with your living expenses after you are done with schoolwork, that's his choice and a win for you.\n\nIf you are going for your masters I assume that means one day you want a different job that isn't the job you are working right now. At that time, the courts will re-evaluate and adjust. It would be a different thing if you quit your job to avoid paying any support, but you aren't doing that. \n\nAlso, demanding someone get a better job doesn't automatically mean that that's possible. Maybe for your current schedule, this IS the best job that you can get that won't impact your schooling. Maybe a \"better\" job would require more hours than you can give. \n\nI feel for the child, I do, but there are tons of children out there who have biological fathers that \"go to the store for a pack of smokes and milk\" and never come back.

He would still make more money if he took the better career in the future.  Again I am fine with him not working more while in school.   So after school it's more advantageous for him to work the career.  It's like people that decline raises because they think the taxes will outweigh the raise.... that isn't how it works.  \n\n 2.  If his father doesn't know, then he's being deceitful to people in the process which is an AH move.  He'd be using someone else's money to get around things they don't know about.  \n\nI have no issue with OP's current set up provided that the father knows what his funding us being used to avoid and that OP isn't going to intentionally hurt his own career just to spite others.", "I have no sympathy for people who can\u2019t accept the responsibility for their actions.
