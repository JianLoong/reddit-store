She says no to almost everything I invite her to. Her mom, my MIL, will try to get her to come to things, but it never works.\n\nI'm trying to plan a birthday party for my daughter's 6th next month. My SIL responded to my request for dates by letting me know her winter was already booked and none of my dates work. I'm tired of her not participating in my children's lives and I want her to play a more active role. She's the only aunt my daughter has.\n\nI think my MIL would be really mad if she knew her DD was refusing to bother yet again with my kids. WIBTA if I told her and asked her to step in? It would probably not make my SIL happy, but her parents might be able to push her into coming to the party.\n\nUpdate: I want to say for everyone who wanted to know, my husband does not like it either but he will not say anything to either MIL or SIL. I am the only one who would. My SIL doesn't hate kids, she is great with them and has friends with kids and sees them more than my kids. My MIL is very close to me and my husband and we talk all the time. I love MIL. My kids aren't brats, they are nice kids. Not perfect. Nice kids. When I tried to talk to her once she just said again she was busy and wouldn't say more.\n\nUpdate 2 I forgot we don't ask family to babysit. Sometimes MIL offers.

She'll start to resent them and you if you keep going this road.", "Yes, YWBTA\n\nObviously your SIL is not interested in your kids.

I get it, you want everyone to be excited about and love your kids, but obviously it isn\u2019t something you can force. By forcing it you will pretty much ensure that she resents your children and never wants any sort of relationship with them. Based on what you wrote, I doubt she will ever want a very close relationship with them, however, some people do find it easier to bond with kids as they get older. That might be the case for her, or maybe she was been stressed the last few years and therefore not showing much interest. There could be a lot of things going on that you might not now of or take into consideration. Don\u2019t bomb any future chances of her warming up to the idea of bonding with your kids over a birthday party.

It's not a character flaw, it's a preference and trying to force your will onto your SIL because it's what you want makes you a giant brat and a massive AH.
