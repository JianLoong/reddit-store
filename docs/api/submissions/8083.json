My SIL responded to my request for dates by letting me know her winter was already booked and none of my dates work. I'm tired of her not participating in my children's lives and I want her to play a more active role. She's the only aunt my daughter has. \n\nI think my MIL would be really mad if she knew her DD was refusing to bother yet again with my kids. WIBTA if I told her and asked her to step in?

She'll start to resent them and you if you keep going this road.", "Yes, YWBTA\n\nObviously your SIL is not interested in your kids.

I get it, you want everyone to be excited about and love your kids, but obviously it isn\u2019t something you can force. By forcing it you will pretty much ensure that she resents your children and never wants any sort of relationship with them. Based on what you wrote, I doubt she will ever want a very close relationship with them, however, some people do find it easier to bond with kids as they get older. That might be the case for her, or maybe she was been stressed the last few years and therefore not showing much interest. There could be a lot of things going on that you might not now of or take into consideration. Don\u2019t bomb any future chances of her warming up to the idea of bonding with your kids over a birthday party.

It's not a character flaw, it's a preference and trying to force your will onto your SIL because it's what you want makes you a giant brat and a massive AH.

So why hurt your kids in the process of disrespecting your SIL\u2019s boundaries?", "YWBTA most definitely. Getting family members to gang up on one another is never a good dynamic. Your SIL clearly doesn't want to participate and if you force her to come, you'll just have a resentful person bringing down the vibe for everyone and your daughter will detect this.

They are your kids, not hers. I'm a mom, and I think you are out of line and presumptuous, and even worse for trying to drag your MIL into it. There's a term for this: \"flying monkeys\".

You're not an AH for wanting your kids to have an aunt who is involved in their lives, but unfortunately that's just not what you have. Forcing a relationship is not going to be good for anyone. Relationships are only valuable if they are voluntary.

You really need to find better things to obsess over than SIL having her own damn life and not wanting to live inside yours. Your children are not the second coming to everyone they are related to.", "Yta. You say she's great with the kids when she's around so it's probably not the kids she has problem with, it's you she doesn't want to be around, it sounds like you like to cause problems between your MIL and SIL when you don't get your way.", "And, of course, your feelings are more important than SIL's, right?", "You want to explain the part where MIL will be mad for you?", "So you ARE going to make your MIL do it by emotionally manipulating her until she \u201cvolunteers\u201d to be your flying monkey.  Got it.\n\nYTA", "INFO: were you and your SIL close before you had kids? Or are you suddenly expecting your SIL to be involved with your life because you had kids?", "Except neither of you have any right to be mad. SIL doesn\u2019t owe you or your kids her time.", "Then it could be that she just doesn't like kids, irrespective of whether they're family or not.", "100%, otherwise OP wouldn\u2019t have made this post.", "That and how exactly would that go? The amount of grown ass adults on reddit who think it's perfectly reasonable and not at all psychotic to try and force another fully formed adult to do something they don't want to do is astounding.", "Same, with one correction- about an hour, maybe two. \n\nI'm not doing days here.", "You are my people. Did you ever see her in \"The Trouble with Angels\"? She was amazing.", "Seriously.. OP doesn\u2019t seem to understand that.\nMy mom and dad both have/had 5 siblings.. only 1 aunt on my mom\u2019s side was actively involved in me and my siblings lives.. we maybe saw others at Christmas once a year. \nOP only cares about her feelings and god forbid SIL have a choice in the matter.", "Yup. I'm not interested in listening to a group of people comparing their kids/babies. They can have fun talking about it, but I'm absolutely not interested, and shouldn't be forced to sit around and listen to it.", "This definitely could be it. Op doesn't mention SIL age but she could just be living a different lifestyle and doesn't want to do aunt stuff. Op also doesn't say how much she asks SIL to do stuff with her kids or if she even tries to keep up a normal relationship with sil. It seems like she's just obsessed with the sil being an amazing aunt because \"she's good with kids.\" Doesn't mean she likes them. There's a lot we don't know and I doubt op will tell us.", "Sounds really weird", "I thought we were friendly. It is just too bad because she is such a good aunt when she is there and she just never has time for my kids. I try to plan things farther out and she just tells me she can't and I try to plan things more spontaneous and she tells me she has plans. I can't win.", "Yes I\u2019ve seen most of her films.  I don\u2019t know too many people who really appreciate her - glad to know you!   The first film I saw with her was His Girl Friday.  The movie was so ahead of it\u2019s time : fast dialog often interrupting - Sorkin wrote the West Wing the same.  The character was originally written as a man in an earlier film called  Front Page - but the remake (Hildy was a man in Front Page) was brilliant and  of the few remakes this one truly outshone the original.", "I am almost certain she isn\u2019t as busy as she claims, she just doesn\u2019t want to be an involved aunt. That is her right.\nYour only option is to respect her choices. You can invite her, but ultimately it\u2019s her call on if she shows or not.\nWhat does her brother think?! Bc you only mention you and your MIL\u2019s feelings", "They\u2019re YOUR kids.. not hers. She is under NO obligation to spend her free time with them. Take the hint.", "INFO: where is your husband in all this?", "Her and Maureen O'Hara are two of my favorite actresses from the Golden Age. \n\nIMHO the remake of \"The Women\" should have never happened. I'm sorry but how can anyone compete with the original line up (Shearer, Crawford, Russell, Hopper to name a few). The Technicolor fashion show sequence. The costumes. The hairstyle. The set design. Brilliant. \n\nAnother favorite is Lana Turner in \"Imitation of Life\". I loved her performance and that of Juanita Moore. Not to mention Mahalia Jackson performing \"Trouble of the World\".", "TBH she might be busy and have other plans. These arent her kids she doesnt have to be their for every party or event about the kids", "This.. I\u2019ve asked it on 2 different comments she has made and got no answer on it yet!", "I\u2019m a TCM addict.   I never saw the remake of  The Women.   I won\u2019t!   Cheers!", "She absolutely can just be that busy! It\u2019s her right regardless. This situation just sounds a lot like something my uncle did and he wasn\u2019t busy, just used it as an excuse to get out of stuff, which is ok! \nMy aunts and uncles were not at every birthday or other events. I just can\u2019t believe the entitlement of OP.. she chose to have her kids.. SIL doesn\u2019t have to be around all the time bc of that choice.", "Honestly this whole post is weird. Like her whole comment about if she tells MIL; MIL will be angry for her. Like what is that about?", "I wish OP would say what her partner has to say their sister not being involved. Again, it\u2019s the SIL\u2019s choice no matter what, but I am curious. \nMy parents philosophy was who wants to be involved can, and who doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s fine too! My parents still invited people to things, even knowing they probably wouldn\u2019t come."]}
