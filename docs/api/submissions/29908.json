Or is he just ignoring the tension in the house?\n\nDo you know if your MIL has been this way about food for years, or if it is a recent development?  Is your husband used to this behaviour since his childhood and not batting an eye, or is he similarly disgusted? (I simply don't understand why he's not refusing to eat your MIL's rotten, mould-ridden food with you.)\n\nIf you've been caring for her for the past year, how is it your MIL has mouldy, out-of-date food in the fridge? I understand you not having come across everything in the cupboards before you moved in, but it doesn't seem to gel with the time-frame that you are still finding mouldy items in the fridge now. Did you just do tasks for her that involved driving, and leave the food at the door for her to put away?\n\nIs her issue with seeing anything been thrown out, or does she similarly object if you did it when she wasn't around and she notices afterwards? Would she notice if you replaced the out-of-date food with newer packs of the same thing? Literally, could you throw something out the day before bin collection day, and replace it like-for-like?  \n\nAre you trying to throw out everything past its date, or are you allow some things past their best before to stay? (After all, best before is a guidance in relation to how long something lasts before it loses quality, but is not an indicator on safety.) And no, I'm not referring to things years past their BB, but a month or a bit more should still be safe.", "NTA,that sounds disgusting, maybe just clean while she's not around to notice. It's not even a matter of being an asshole it's a matter of that rotten food can make you and everyone it sick, although how you get around her yelling at you is difficult, maybe get your husband to help it is his mother after all", "NTA I'll be honest. On a lot of things I'm ambivalent about expiration dates. Canned foods, dry goods, even yogurt and sour cream that haven't been opened yet and are only a couple days after the expiration go for a case by case basis. I draw the line at green growy stuff. The Old Guy and the kids are allergic to PCNs. I don't need to be growing it in the fridge. That's just nasty and it probably contributes to her bad health.", "NTA no sanitary person would feel comfortable eating or cooking with expired food that is molding. I wouldn\u2019t even feel comfortable keeping my own separate food in the same fridge.", "NTA. If your MIL is sick enough from a stroke to need you to live with her, then just wait until she\u2019s in bed or napping, then quietly throw everything out. It shouldn\u2019t take more than a couple of loads to the garbage can.  Then just ignore her, and make your meals.  When my mom got dementia you couldn\u2019t reason with her, and she hated any change. I just had to be the \u2018bad guy\u2019 and dealt with her 40+ years of hoarding. And if hubby doesn\u2019t support you, let him eat some moldy cheese on rotten crackers.", "NTA. It's disgusting and super unhealthy. And even more hurting that she knows about your past and still insists.\n\nWhat does your husband say about this? I hope he is packing some boxes to move.", "NTA. It's a matter of health safety.", "NTA.  While you can scrape mold off hard cheese and it's generally OK and you can go a little past expiration dates, YEARS and ROTTEN VEGETABLES are a no-go.  I would have her evaluated for mental decline before you move out.", "NTA \nYou can literally die by eating that stuff and if your MIL has been surviving off of that than take her to a doctor, she might have some mutation that allows her to eat poison and shit", "NTA but not sure that helps you. I'm sorry that sounds frustrating. My only idea here is to cook food you buy for the family occasionally and if she doesn't want to eat it then she can cook something else with her expired stuff.\n\nAt some point this is headed towards not able to care for oneself though.", "NTA I had the same issue when we moved in with my grandmother.  In the middle of the night, I was cleaning out the fridge and throwing the bad food away. I know the verbal abuse can be draining. Sometimes, you just need to do what you need to do.", "NTA\n\nYou've been doing a lot to help your MIL and are staying in her home during a transitional period. Your concerns about the expired and moldy food are valid, especially considering your past experiences with food-related issues. It's essential for you to prioritize your own well-being and comfort, especially when it comes to something as important as food. While it might be beneficial to find a way to communicate your concerns more effectively, you're not in the wrong for ordering food to ensure you have something you can comfortably eat. It's a tricky situation, but open and respectful communication with your MIL could help resolve the issue.", "NTA Make a list of every single item, brand and other details, go to the store and purchase everything. Come home, clean out the fridge and cabinets, and put everything you just brought where the old stuff was. She will yell, she will get mad, but say nothing. You got her safe food, the exact same food even, the end. It isn\u2019t possible to negotiate with people who hoard rotten food. All you can do is replace it out of your own pocket and let them flip out. They might go to the trash to get the rotten stuff, so you have to bring it straight to the dump. Like, don\u2019t give them even a minute chance to drag it out of the garbage again.", "Move out.", "NTA. But you surely can buy her new products in exchange of mouldy ones, as well as fresh tomatoes.", "NTA. I dealt with this with a relative.  I threw a few things out but kept at least one package of his old things.  I put the new things behind the old and just reached behind when I got food.  After a while I threw out everything that was outdated.  We just didn't tell him.  Since he thought we used the old things he was happy.  My SIL was part of the deception.", "NTA- \n\nDo not eat things from that kitchen. Heck no!\n\nAlso your husband is an AH. His mom is not able to care for herself... At all...

Perhaps your husband can deal with this?\n\nMy mother protested, of course, but I showed her doctor what her fridge was like once, and her doctor read the riot act to her, which really helped me.

They haven't been there a year.  They have helped her with shopping for a year but they weren't going through her cupboard to see what was expired", "This.

She put out butter for a meal with my mom, and a fruit fly got onto it. While putting away leftovers, she stuck the stick of butter -- fly included -- into the fridge. Don't get me started on her putting raw and cooked food into a cooler indefinitely because her fridge was so full of rotting food.\n\nIt's a sad and dangerous manifestation of mental decline, which makes sense for a stroke patient.

Mold on anything else goes in the trash.", "This is exactly what I was going to suggest. \n\nNTA.\nOP, replace everything while she's sleeping. It's okay for her to get mad.

If you read my questions, I said I understand them not having come across the stuff in the cupboards, and was more questioning how they didn't spot mouldy items in the fridge sooner - because it would be more understandable they'd help put things in the fridge, or make a drink when they were visiting.", "Exactly. This sounds like a lot of mold on an institutional sized brick of cheese that may be years old for all we know.", "But you don't keep fresh fruit in the fridge anyway right?  Is that really all you eat -- just fruit and nothing else?", "Agree, just replace the food and don\u2019t say anything about it. Maybe I\u2019m wrong here but it sort of sounds like there was a confrontation between OP and MIL when she realized the food was all expired and gross. OP admits she has a phobia about expired food because of their hoarder parent. If she had just replaced it and said nothing it probably would\u2019ve been fine. So I can agree with ESH. \n\nHonestly my grandmother has been like this the last couple times I\u2019ve visited. With the moldy cheese and stuff I mean. She lives alone and doesn\u2019t have much appetite but she also seems to buying stuff in the quantity she did 10+ years ago when she and my grandpa were younger & ate more.

I'm sure they probably went there and cleaned a bit in the last year too.  So doesn't make sense how there are moldy jars in the fridge.", "Tbf to OP, I'm always horrified when I open a jar of something in my fridge and find it has gone mouldy - and I access my fridge multiple times a day. Sometimes things go mouldy and you can't tell without opening the jar/packaging.", "I\u2019m not even good at keeping track of what\u2019s in my own fridge. Sometimes stuff just gets shoved to the back and ignored/forgotten as you eat the stuff towards the front, then you find it years later.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there isn\u2019t hoarder/neurological issues either, with her insistence that it\u2019s still edible. She might struggle with throwing food away or even just not be able to process that she shouldn\u2019t eat it.", "It depends on how much the MIL let them do.   But I know not long after surgery I've had plenty of people pick up food, put the bags in the kitchen and let me deal with it since it's MY kitchen not theirs and they don't know where stuff goes.  Not gonna bash on someone doing the best they can.  Sometimes people don't allow much help.", "They were still living in their own house, which per post recently sold.  There may be other care givers & visitors, too, so they may not have checked as closely.\n\n  \nMy spouse & I had similar experience with his mom, though no where near as bad as described, because other family shopped and put things away in the frig & pantry but never checked the existing contents for expiration.    \nOne Saturday, we tossed 4 bottles of open salad dressing expired 3 & 4 months prior.  The soy sauce was a year past expiration.  It was a constant battle.\n\nAnd I brought food in coolers for same reasons, because yuck.\n\nOp is NTA.", "Which is why I asked the question......still waiting on OP to reply", "I didn't call her an asshole I'm just curious how after a year they didnt notice but only noticed after the moved in.  Like you said eventually you noticed in , but OP didn't notice moldy cheese.", "you attacked them, I doubt they will answer, I wouldn't if the question basically shamed me.", "well maybe they shouldnt post on place where they are asking if they are an asshole or not lol", "I'm curious if you have ever tried to care for a stubborn relative while still trying to work and hold your regular life together?", "you know you don't have to agree with what everyone writes here right.  Clearly you disagree with me asking that question.  Just ignore it lol", "you do realize how forums work?", "My maternal granny was like this and she had things like jars and canned food like more than 10 years old.  The things is, it was mostly me and my mom or my sis doing all the throwing and nagging her not to do that, but didn't really work, oh well.  \n\nThe thing is my aunt was not the one to throw things out becuz granny would have tiny tantrum every time we tried to get rid of her old things.   We never cared about her getting bit upset because at the end of the day, we knew that she loved us (especially me) unconditionally and she would let it go.  As a DIL to my granny, my aunt didn't have that layer of flexibility and we did think it would make their relationship worse so we didn't mind being the bad guy.\n\nYour hubby should be the one throwing things out.  Not you.  She will scream at him and they will eventually mend, lol, but not for you.\n\nNTA!!!!!", "Best by dates are suggestions but it depends on the product.  \n\nBest by date say within 6 months in crackers that haven\u2019t been opened might be ok.  A date of a year ago very likely not.  \n\nUse by date gets a bit more attention especially if it is things that spoil like meat, dairy, etc.  \n\nEggs even if not close to the best by date I always do a float test before using them as you never know if a minuscule crack has let in air. If the egg floats completely off the bottom of the container (because of the gas generated by it going bad)  then in the trash it goes. \n\nSo to cleaning out your MIL\u2019s stuff.  If you\u2019re gonna have to sneak then first make a list if everything you need to replace.  Then go shopping to get those things.  Go through the pantry and replace expired for new ideally while MIL is busy doing something else or husband keeps her busy. \n\nBag the other stuff up ideally in a black trashbag she can\u2019t see through and chuck it. \n\nAlso my take on it is if you do get busted for it is just let her scream.  When\u2019s she\u2019s done you can say \u201cwe want you to be as healthy as possible so yes I have thrown out iffy food to keep you safe.\u201d\n\n I will say how impressed I am that 10 year old can of soup hadn\u2019t already exploded.", "NTA\n\n I had relatives like that too. \"Oh it is in the refrigerator it will be fine\". One time when visiting I just threw the expired stuff out. The relative was not happy but I did say I would replace what I threw out (and did so).  I gave my relative no choice - I just did it and ignored the protesting. You may have to do the same. They will get over it,", "Info: are you replacing what you're throwing away? MIL is an adult struggling with health issues. She needs to feel like she has some agency and she deserves to be treated as the host when you're staying in her home. You're 100% in the right to object to eating moldy food, but you need to go about this the right way. We went through a similar thing with my grandfather and it was heartbreaking every time I went over to help him and he told me that no one else ever ASKED before they threw out all his stuff.", "Oh Lord!!!  \nAbsolutely, positively NTA!!  \nSome of those foods are dangerous. Cutting mold off foods like cheese is dangerous, the mold can extend far deeper than what is visible. For her own well being you need to clean out that kitchen.

I grew up with food scarcity and so my parents ended up food hoarding in their later years. Usually canning and freezing. After Dad passed mom didn\u2019t really clean or get rid of things. When she ended up in the hospital and nursing home we went in and removed all the spoiled and severely outdated food. Now that she\u2019s back home either we or more often her neighbors check the fridge for expired items. She doesn\u2019t do much but kind of huff as we dump things now and I usually ask how old it is, do a visual inspection and offer to go get some more\u2014which she usually refuses. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be a challenge but perhaps approach it via the family (my in-laws won\u2019t listen to me either) and say hey we want to make sure things are safe.

The Best By date is literally the date that the manufacturer of that item will guarantee that it\u2019s at its absolute *peak* freshness. There are some food items that have a much longer shelflife then what is indicated with the BB date. It is in the manufacturers interest, while making sure these dates indicate their product is good for a while, to have a shorter BB date for those people who will literally throw the item out the day after and go buy more of that product again. For instance if people realized when stored properly that pasta and rice can be safely stored almost 10 years, that would mean people would break open that bag of rice 1 month past the BB date instead of tossing and buying more. Food waste on the consumer\u2019s part is very beneficial to the companies selling food. Fyi, aspirin has also been shown in studies to lose very little of it effectiveness even when stored for 10 years. \n\nIt is not ok that MIL is eating moldy food but you need to accept the fact that she may be correct that some of her food items are still good past the BB date. Convinced that something has magically gone bad one day past the BB date is just as nutty as thinking a 10yo can of soup would still be good to eat. \n\nYou are not the ass for refusing to eat what she has in the cabinet, that is completely your right.
