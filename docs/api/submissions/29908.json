Or is he just ignoring the tension in the house?\n\nDo you know if your MIL has been this way about food for years, or if it is a recent development?  Is your husband used to this behaviour since his childhood and not batting an eye, or is he similarly disgusted? (I simply don't understand why he's not refusing to eat your MIL's rotten, mould-ridden food with you.)\n\nIf you've been caring for her for the past year, how is it your MIL has mouldy, out-of-date food in the fridge? I understand you not having come across everything in the cupboards before you moved in, but it doesn't seem to gel with the time-frame that you are still finding mouldy items in the fridge now. Did you just do tasks for her that involved driving, and leave the food at the door for her to put away?\n\nIs her issue with seeing anything been thrown out, or does she similarly object if you did it when she wasn't around and she notices afterwards? Would she notice if you replaced the out-of-date food with newer packs of the same thing? Literally, could you throw something out the day before bin collection day, and replace it like-for-like?  \n\nAre you trying to throw out everything past its date, or are you allow some things past their best before to stay? (After all, best before is a guidance in relation to how long something lasts before it loses quality, but is not an indicator on safety.) And no, I'm not referring to things years past their BB, but a month or a bit more should still be safe.", "NTA,that sounds disgusting, maybe just clean while she's not around to notice. It's not even a matter of being an asshole it's a matter of that rotten food can make you and everyone it sick, although how you get around her yelling at you is difficult, maybe get your husband to help it is his mother after all", "NTA I'll be honest. On a lot of things I'm ambivalent about expiration dates. Canned foods, dry goods, even yogurt and sour cream that haven't been opened yet and are only a couple days after the expiration go for a case by case basis. I draw the line at green growy stuff. The Old Guy and the kids are allergic to PCNs. I don't need to be growing it in the fridge. That's just nasty and it probably contributes to her bad health.", "NTA no sanitary person would feel comfortable eating or cooking with expired food that is molding. I wouldn\u2019t even feel comfortable keeping my own separate food in the same fridge.", "NTA. If your MIL is sick enough from a stroke to need you to live with her, then just wait until she\u2019s in bed or napping, then quietly throw everything out. It shouldn\u2019t take more than a couple of loads to the garbage can.  Then just ignore her, and make your meals.  When my mom got dementia you couldn\u2019t reason with her, and she hated any change. I just had to be the \u2018bad guy\u2019 and dealt with her 40+ years of hoarding. And if hubby doesn\u2019t support you, let him eat some moldy cheese on rotten crackers.", "NTA. It's disgusting and super unhealthy. And even more hurting that she knows about your past and still insists.\n\nWhat does your husband say about this? I hope he is packing some boxes to move.", "NTA. It's a matter of health safety.", "NTA.  While you can scrape mold off hard cheese and it's generally OK and you can go a little past expiration dates, YEARS and ROTTEN VEGETABLES are a no-go.  I would have her evaluated for mental decline before you move out.", "NTA \nYou can literally die by eating that stuff and if your MIL has been surviving off of that than take her to a doctor, she might have some mutation that allows her to eat poison and shit", "NTA but not sure that helps you. I'm sorry that sounds frustrating. My only idea here is to cook food you buy for the family occasionally and if she doesn't want to eat it then she can cook something else with her expired stuff.\n\nAt some point this is headed towards not able to care for oneself though.", "NTA I had the same issue when we moved in with my grandmother.  In the middle of the night, I was cleaning out the fridge and throwing the bad food away. I know the verbal abuse can be draining. Sometimes, you just need to do what you need to do.", "NTA\n\nYou've been doing a lot to help your MIL and are staying in her home during a transitional period. Your concerns about the expired and moldy food are valid, especially considering your past experiences with food-related issues. It's essential for you to prioritize your own well-being and comfort, especially when it comes to something as important as food. While it might be beneficial to find a way to communicate your concerns more effectively, you're not in the wrong for ordering food to ensure you have something you can comfortably eat. It's a tricky situation, but open and respectful communication with your MIL could help resolve the issue.", "NTA Make a list of every single item, brand and other details, go to the store and purchase everything. Come home, clean out the fridge and cabinets, and put everything you just brought where the old stuff was. She will yell, she will get mad, but say nothing. You got her safe food, the exact same food even, the end. It isn\u2019t possible to negotiate with people who hoard rotten food. All you can do is replace it out of your own pocket and let them flip out. They might go to the trash to get the rotten stuff, so you have to bring it straight to the dump. Like, don\u2019t give them even a minute chance to drag it out of the garbage again.", "Move out.", "NTA. But you surely can buy her new products in exchange of mouldy ones, as well as fresh tomatoes.", "NTA. I dealt with this with a relative.  I threw a few things out but kept at least one package of his old things.  I put the new things behind the old and just reached behind when I got food.  After a while I threw out everything that was outdated.  We just didn't tell him.  Since he thought we used the old things he was happy.  My SIL was part of the deception.", "NTA- \n\nDo not eat things from that kitchen. Heck no!\n\nAlso your husband is an AH. His mom is not able to care for herself... At all... Not if she doesn't have proper support. And clearly she does not have proper support. Ya all need to be talking about in-home aids and grocery services and cleaning services. This lady is in danger.", "NTA\n\nTake her out for the day and have your husband throw away all the food and deep clean the fridges.  Then it's done. She can scream all she wants, you guys know it's unsanitary and it has to be done or she's going to give herself food poisoning or worse.", "NTA. \nSimple. \nJust don\u2019t eat there and don\u2019t discuss it. \nMind your own business till you leave.", "ESH, Everyone Sucks Here.  Including your husband, who isn't even mentioned in this situation.  Why isn't he involved, this is his own mother.\n\nYour AITA title has little to do with the actual conflict---*which is you throwing away her stuff.*\n\nYou have legit concerns about the expired food.  The solution is to throw it out **and then replace everything item-for-item.**", "Info:  For the past year if you been taking care of her and doing grocery shopping for her. How is that she has food that expired 5/10 years ago?  Sounds like you and your husband didn;t do that great of a job the past year,", "YTA - you are a guest on this home.

She keeps things for forever, leaves things out that can go bad and then refreezes, etc.  I just can't.  So, I have her for dinner and take her out.", "NTA. And honestly I\u2019d toss everything and start from a scratch. Your husband can deal with her temper tantrum. If not, you move out and call adult services.", "NTA. I'd clean it out regardless of if she gets upset. She could poison you or herself using these ingredients. She can get upset, but you don't need to compromise here.", "I would just buy/ eat somewhere else. Or ignore and buy your own Ingredients to cook as and when you need it.

Eating moldy food could kill you all. She'll get over it. Talk to her doctor about her obsession with eating rotten food.", "NTA is your MIL my dad? \ud83d\ude02 the last time I visited him, I found way expired antibiotics in his refrigerator. I wanted to throw them away, but he said he just pops a couple if he feel a cold coming on. \ud83d\ude33\n\nMy sister and her kids had to move in with him because they are impacted by the Lahaina fire. She just has to zip her lip. She is living in his home at his mercy, so she doesn\u2019t complain or try to change him. Unfortunately I think that\u2019s what you have to do too.", "NTA. When you can visibly see mold then mold has propagated within the entire food item. You should go over to CDC.Gov and print out their guidelines on safe food handling. It\u2019ll be eye opening for her, that\u2019s for sure.", "My mother did this and was always getting terrible stomach problems, probably food poisoning. When I visited her, I just waited till she was out or asleep, then went through her fridge, freezer and cupboards and threw everything out and replaced it with stuff I bought. \n\nI think it's easier to firm line with your own parent. Perhaps your husband can deal with this?\n\nMy mother protested, of course, but I showed her doctor what her fridge was like once, and her doctor read the riot act to her, which really helped me. (I had returned to my home country to care for my mother who was recovering from, you guessed it, a very serious bout of vomitting and diarrhea.)", "It says they are just staying there a few weeks. They haven't been there a year.  They have helped her with shopping for a year but they weren't going through her cupboard to see what was expired", "This. And maybe replace the expired with a few fresh versions next time you\u2019re at the store?", "The thing is, if it is very hard cheese \u2014 like cheddar \u2014 there is absolutely nothing wrong with cutting off a little mold and eating the non-moldy part. But this doesn\u2019t sound like a *little* mold on a slightly-old brick of cheese.", "Exactly, I don't want to keep anything in that fridge!", "My grandma has dementia and one of the first symptoms was an extreme disregard for food safety. She put out butter for a meal with my mom, and a fruit fly got onto it. While putting away leftovers, she stuck the stick of butter -- fly included -- into the fridge. Don't get me started on her putting raw and cooked food into a cooler indefinitely because her fridge was so full of rotting food.\n\nIt's a sad and dangerous manifestation of mental decline, which makes sense for a stroke patient. NAH since she'd otherwise be TA but she's really not all there. If your husband isn't handling this as a go-between then he is definitely TA since it's his mom.", "This. I have no problem cutting the mold off cheese, but I don\u2019t serve it to others or expect them to be fine with it. Mold on anything else goes in the trash.", "This is exactly what I was going to suggest. \n\nNTA.\nOP, replace everything while she's sleeping. It's okay for her to get mad. But the most important thing is that she has access to healthy, fresh food that is not expired by several years or is growing a fur.", ">You have legit concerns about the expired food. The solution is to throw it out and then replace everything item-for-item.\n\n\n\nThis is a good suggestion that you should have offered Op without saying she sucks for the frustration of cleaning up after someone and not wanting to eat expired foods.", "They were picking up food, not cleaning out the cabinets.", "I appreciate that but what wasn't clear was if they left the food at the door for MIL to put away, or if they actually helped put things away. If you read my questions, I said I understand them not having come across the stuff in the cupboards, and was more questioning how they didn't spot mouldy items in the fridge sooner - because it would be more understandable they'd help put things in the fridge, or make a drink when they were visiting.", "Exactly. This sounds like a lot of mold on an institutional sized brick of cheese that may be years old for all we know.", "But you don't keep fresh fruit in the fridge anyway right?  Is that really all you eat -- just fruit and nothing else?", "Agree, just replace the food and don\u2019t say anything about it. Maybe I\u2019m wrong here but it sort of sounds like there was a confrontation between OP and MIL when she realized the food was all expired and gross. OP admits she has a phobia about expired food because of their hoarder parent. If she had just replaced it and said nothing it probably would\u2019ve been fine. So I can agree with ESH. \n\nHonestly my grandmother has been like this the last couple times I\u2019ve visited. With the moldy cheese and stuff I mean. She lives alone and doesn\u2019t have much appetite but she also seems to buying stuff in the quantity she did 10+ years ago when she and my grandpa were younger & ate more. It doesn\u2019t seem to occur to her that it\u2019ll go bad since she\u2019s never had the issue before. I just quietly go to the store & buy new when I visit her and say nothing.", "When you get food for someone you typically put it away for them right. Especially when they just had a stroke.  I'm sure they probably went there and cleaned a bit in the last year too.  So doesn't make sense how there are moldy jars in the fridge.", "Tbf to OP, I'm always horrified when I open a jar of something in my fridge and find it has gone mouldy - and I access my fridge multiple times a day. Sometimes things go mouldy and you can't tell without opening the jar/packaging.", "I\u2019m not even good at keeping track of what\u2019s in my own fridge. Sometimes stuff just gets shoved to the back and ignored/forgotten as you eat the stuff towards the front, then you find it years later.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there isn\u2019t hoarder/neurological issues either, with her insistence that it\u2019s still edible. She might struggle with throwing food away or even just not be able to process that she shouldn\u2019t eat it.", "It depends on how much the MIL let them do.   But I know not long after surgery I've had plenty of people pick up food, put the bags in the kitchen and let me deal with it since it's MY kitchen not theirs and they don't know where stuff goes.  Not gonna bash on someone doing the best they can.  Sometimes people don't allow much help.", "They were still living in their own house, which per post recently sold.  There may be other care givers & visitors, too, so they may not have checked as closely.\n\n  \nMy spouse & I had similar experience with his mom, though no where near as bad as described, because other family shopped and put things away in the frig & pantry but never checked the existing contents for expiration.    \nOne Saturday, we tossed 4 bottles of open salad dressing expired 3 & 4 months prior.  The soy sauce was a year past expiration.  It was a constant battle.\n\nAnd I brought food in coolers for same reasons, because yuck.\n\nOp is NTA.", "Which is why I asked the question......still waiting on OP to reply", "I didn't call her an asshole I'm just curious how after a year they didnt notice but only noticed after the moved in.  Like you said eventually you noticed in , but OP didn't notice moldy cheese.", "you attacked them, I doubt they will answer, I wouldn't if the question basically shamed me.", "well maybe they shouldnt post on place where they are asking if they are an asshole or not lol", "I'm curious if you have ever tried to care for a stubborn relative while still trying to work and hold your regular life together?", "you know you don't have to agree with what everyone writes here right.  Clearly you disagree with me asking that question.  Just ignore it lol", "you do realize how forums work?"]}
