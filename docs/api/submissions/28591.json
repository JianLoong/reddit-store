{"id": 28591, "submission_id": "174589z", "title": "AITA for telling my MIL she can no longer have contact with my son?", "selftext": "I\u2019m a single mom (F42) of four- Arden (F13), Briony (F11), Robin (M10), and Kaya (F7). All of us, except Robin, are Deaf, with ASL as our first language. Arden and Briony\u2019s dad (M46) left when the girls were 4 and 2, and I met Kaya\u2019s dad, Alex (M43) shortly after. He had just come into custody of his nephew, Robin. \r  \nRobin\u2019s bio mom (Layla, F47) gave Robin up to focus on recovering from her long-term drug addiction. Robin is fully aware of who his bio mom is, but considers Alex to be his dad, and has called me his mom since the age of 2/3ish. Layla has told me in the past how grateful she is for me filling that role, and that she feels more like Robin\u2019s aunt than his mom. All this to say, when Alex was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, it was pretty clear to all of us that I would continue to raise Robin as my son after Alex\u2019s death.\r  \nAlex passed away in June, and ever since, his mom has been causing problems. While she\u2019s never been outwardly hostile towards me/my children, she often complains about our use of ASL (Most of the family learnt at least some basics to support communication, but MIL insisted she was too old and couldn\u2019t do it) and has made comments in the past about my inability as a mother due to my deafness. My older girls are practically non-existent to her, and she often \u2018forgets\u2019 that Kaya is her grandchild too and focus solely on Robin.\r  \nMIL spent most of the funeral telling people that I was \u2018unfit\u2019 and trying to \u2018steal Robin away from his real family\u2019. It was hurtful, to say the least, and made me uncomfortable welcoming MIL into my home after that, but I convinced myself that it was for the benefit of the kids- they\u2019ve just lost their dad. I didn\u2019t want to take away a grandparent too. \r  \nLast Saturday, Robin came back from an outing with MIL looking miserable. He wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone about what had happened and spent the rest of the weekend shut away in his room. I tried to ask MIL what was going on, but she didn\u2019t answer any of my messages. Finally, Robin broke down in tears, asking me if \u2018Grandma was really going to take him away\u2019. It turns out that MIL has been repeatedly telling Robin that she\u2019s going to take him away from us, even telling him she\u2019ll call CPS on me to have the kids removed. On Saturday, MIL had gone even further, saying she could just drive away with him, and he\u2019d \u2018never have to see us again\u2019. \r  \nI immediately sent MIL a message informing her that she was no longer welcome in my home or near any of the kids, and let Layla know what was going on and that she was still welcome to visit/have Robin to stay, if MIL was nowhere nearby. My phone has been blowing up ever since, with people asking me to reconsider. I haven\u2019t said anything about what happened, so can only assume MIL is spreading false information, but all the negative responses are making me doubt if I\u2019m actually in the right here. \r  \n", "created_utc": 1696891082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174589z/aita_for_telling_my_mil_she_can_no_longer_have/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
