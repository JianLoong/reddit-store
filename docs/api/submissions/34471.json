They both agreed on split custody over me. Thinks back then were fine, I was entirely ok with going back and fourth and I found it even amusing to spend one on one time with 1 parent at a time. But when I turned 15, my father had met my step mom, she already had kids, 1 boy and one girl, my step brother is 12, my step sister is 8. I don't hate them tho, I don't hold them accountable for anything their mother does. But God, their mother is not really what I expected.

It wasn't the best thing to do but I completely lashed out and started screaming. My step mom said that 'you're from the past, your dad needs to move on, he has a new family now' that really stung tbh. I'm not very proud of this but I will openly say that I said this 'So maybe this is why your last marriage failed' not proud of it but I was angry.\n\nMy mom quickly came over and picked me up, cause I just couldn't stand to be there anymore. Yesterday I had gotten a text from my dad, and to summarize it up, what he pretty much said was that he wanted to move on and focus on his new family.

If dad asks why you\u2019re not visiting remind him he wanted to move on.  Also ask your mom if you can go to therapy; it would help you deal with your feelings Nd learn how to respond in healthier ways. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you.", "NTA, in this age of disposable relationships, the 2nd 3rd and 4th spouses tend to forget the world doesn't revolve around just their children.  The families/children that came before are all a huge factor in going forward.  You are not someone to just be dismissed, which is what your stepmother wanted and your dad did.  This makes them both huge assh\\*les.  Please have empathy for the younger children living with them, like you, they did not ask for this.  I am glad your mother and stepfather are being so supportive.", "WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F***?!?!\n\nSOOOOO NTA and im sooooo sorry your dad is terrible.", "NTA. By no means did you cause this, and there are no secret action or words that you could have figured out in time to prevent it. Your dad and stepmom are horrible people. You can't just \"move on\" from a child.

My siblings and I ended up being what we called \"back of the couch\" kids to my father after he remarried. That's when a family picture is taken and the first family stands behind the couch while the new spouse and stepkids are sitting as a group. Our father's new wife (NEVER any kind of 'mother' to us) acted the same way. Her kids came first. It was easier for us; we were all adults. Still stung.\n\nYou have one very good thing on your side: support from your mother and maternal family. If you have the means, give therapy a shot. No matter how much my sibs and I clung together, individually we needed to be helped through the anger by a pro. We couldn't dump on one another.\n\nOne thing to keep aware: your father is going to get old. If he needs care, dollars to donuts, the steps won't step in. They'll turn him around and give him a shove in your direction, saying \"he's YOUR dad. We have to look after OUR mom.\" Settle in your mind how you'll feel about that.", "NTa\n\n\"Do not ever contact me again *name*.\"\n\nDon't call him dad use his real name.", "NTA tell him not to let the door hit you on your way out of my life.", "The reason why I'm asking Aita is because I don't know if what I said was too far, her last marriage was a mess, and she had gotten cheated on and stuff. I don't know if I went to far or not, and I just want some unbias feedback on my situation.\n\nMost of my relatives are on my side, especially my mom, but my dad's relatives are kinda confused in the situation, and my stepmoms relatives are 100 percent on her side.

I too had a devious stepmother who was insanely jealous of my mother and hence did not want me around (she actually told me that).  My father was a weak man and followed her lead, taking the path of least resistance.  I rarely heard from him before 8 and never thereafter until I was in my 30s.  \n\nYour mother sounds like a gem.  She clearly cares about you and wants what is best for you.  I'm glad she is in your corner.  I admire that she is willing to do what she can to help heal the rift between you and your dad. Also, glad you have an understanding stepfather who will try to be there for you when your bio dad isn't.  You have some wonderful people in your corner,\n\nSadly, some parents are hugely flawed and will never be what their children need or want or wish.  This is never a reflection on their children even though it can feel that way.  If your dad cannot/will not be the father he should be, that is on him, NOT you.  Do your best to go forward surrounded and supported by those who ARE what you need/want/wish.  Your dad stands to lose a lot if he loses you as you sound like a fine young person!  Good luck to you.", "NTA\nMaybe it's harsh but you lost your Dad forever because he is TA This is the type that later post here my son.doesnt want to talk to me I don't know Why?\nCut him.out I know it's very difficult to do for you and easy for me to say\nBut I wish you the best going forward", "NTA. it might help to write down the points you want to discuss with your dad. So you have a point of reference and don't get flustered trying to verbalize what you need to say to him. \n\nHe has behaved appallingly to you.

Frustration with the situation and naivety played a role in making them scream.\n\nOn the other hand, step mom is a fully adult, capable of malice. From her words, *\"your dad needs to move on\"* I suspect she purposely engineered the moment to get a reaction from OP, and subsequently convince her husband that OP doesn't fits into his life anymore. Many step parents want nothing to do with their spouse's former children and do everything they can to push them away.", "Thanks, I do admit, yelling was probably definitely not the best action I could've took.
