They need to calm down", "NTA\n\nThey dared you to jump in a lake. Even when it isn't cold enough to freeze your tits off, many people will strip off shoes and pants before jumping in so they're not dragging you down with the added weight. And to act like you should have brought a bathing suit during the winter when they didn't bring one?\n\nI just...are you overweight? Skinny? Not that either is a valid reason to complain, I just don't understand.", "You were wearing your undies. That probably covered as much as a bathing suit. Where is the problem??!! NTA", "Yeah, that's ridiculous. I don't get the pearl clutching. I'm a woman and that would be fine with me. The only thing I'd worry about is OP freezing his ass off.", "I'm pretty sure this is one of the mildest possible results of Truth or Dare.", "Honestly, the bits which are likeliest to freeze off are on the other side than the ass.", "Check out the nz trumpet add for togs, togs, undies\n\nUnder nz rules what you did is ok in the coverage department, bit dumb in the swimming in winter department", "I don't understand Americans (Australian here). NTA.", "NTA. Underwear and swimwear literally give you the same amount of coverage.", "I was assuming you were naked and was still rolling my eyes about your friends being so dramatic, but apparently you had underwear on? What's the difference then from a swimsuit? NTA", "NTA. Your friends are really uptight!", "Did your friends gasp and clutch their pearls when they saw your undies? Lol NTA. Did these people time travel from the 50's or something?", "NTA, isn't it the essence of a dare that you go right in?", "NTA unless they were crotchless underwear.", "NTA that is one of the weirdest overreactions I've ever heard of.  In the middle of drunk truth or dare, they expected you to go up and change into swim trunks you'd have no reason for bringing?  Or to go in fully clothed, which can be even more dangerous?  And this RUINED the night?  They are ridiculous.", "Wow. NTA. I don\u2019t understand it at all. I\u2019m trying really hard to put myself in their shoes, but it doesn\u2019t add up. It\u2019s too weird for me. I\u2019ve seen plenty of my friends in their undies or even partially nude and never made a big deal of it.", "NTA.  They reacted like you jumped in nude.", "NTA\n\nWow they\u2019re extra. Done what you described with plenty of male and female friends in my late teens and twenties. It was just good fun. \n\nUnderwear / swimsuit - they cover the same parts with fabric. \n\nYour friends are very bored.", "Well, I don't think they would have approved of how I would have gone into the lake then. But I don't think any of my friends would be shocked or bothered my my skinny dipping on a dare.\n\nGet some less prudish friends.", "The only thing weirder than their reaction is a group of people in their mid 20s playing truth or dare. NTA", "I don't really see how swimming trunks are any different from underwear.  Trunks cover up your legs more, maybe.  Of course you can't dive into freezing water with your clothes on, the wet clothes will drag you down.  I don't think it's weird.  Its what I would have expected in the winter where nobody has swimming trunks with them.", "NTA\n\nYou had underwear on. Not any different than a bathing suit.", "Let me get this straight.*They* dared *you* to jump in the lake abd then got all in a tizzy because you did it? It's not even like you were naked, you had underwear on. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou could have gone in naked.", "NTA, unless your undies are a ten year old rag. Your friends are prudes. There is currently a contrary double standard in our society, where it's okay for women to be almost naked, but they are affronted by men's thighs.", "NTA. They literally dared you to do it and you did. What did they expect. \n\nI have swam in my bra and underwear at a public river spot plenty of times. And nobody even bats an eye. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even consider you T A H even if you were wearing tighty whities that became see through because you were dared and they didn\u2019t have to look. It\u2019s not like you stripped completely and helicoptered in their faces. Jeez.", "Jeezo. You weren't naked, you had your (under)pants on. NTA.", "NTA. So where exactly is the difference between undies and swim wear? And why are they so dumb to say \"you could have worn swim wear\"?? And the ones saying you could have gone in your clothes are lacking brain cells as well... They sound overdramatic.", "NTA, unless maybe if you were wearing a studded leather thong and they are all trying to un see it LOL", "I would have gone nude, your friends are pearl clutching prudes so it would have made it way funnier.", "Polar bear plunge!! Wearing clothes would just have added weight. Having a towel for when you got out of the lake would have been the smart thing to do though. Your friends ruined the night by being dramatic. NTA.", "You forget: while inebriated", "Do girls know about shrinkage?", "Were they white? You may have given more of a show than you intended,  the effects of the cold notwithstanding.", "Are some of them couples, did maybe one of them look at you differently and a partner took offense and made it a big deal?", "Called budgie smugglers where I live", "Your friends are fucking losers (with respect) \n\nNTA", "NTA and your friends are weird as hell.", "Me thinks maybe they saw your monster junk and it made them all shrivel up and now they have to put you down!\nNTA buddy.", "NTA.   You were wearing clothes, you weren't nude", "NTA. You had your underwear on.", "NTA, what did you bring a pack of nuns to this outing or something?", "So iu jumped in naked or in underwear?  Either way, they dared, yiu did it.. bravo.  \nFuck them", "NTA. They sound boring as hell.\n\nHowever, OP, promise me no more swimming in lakes drunk, okay?", "NTA.\nWhat is the difference between underwear and a set of Speedos? Depending on your underwear (boxers for example) would cover more than Speedos ever would.", "NTA you didn't dive in nude your friends are dramatic", " I\u2019m confused by what their problem was nta", "NTA, your friends sound like they would scream til they died if 2 bunnies were humping in front of them because there were girls present.  \nI thought you were naked jumping in to play a prank, but nope you got underwear and only jumped because of a dare.  If they can't take it, don't make the stupid dare in the first place.  It seems they all forgot how to be themselves after graduating.  Kinda of dad tho.", "NTA. Your friends are ridiculous. You were covered, if they didn't like it, they didn't have to look. A bathing suit, in winter, give me a break. Wet heavy clothes would be very dangerous. Back in the day, bare-assed was best, for crazy stunts, but I'm 63(f). Ask your friends why they Looked, if they were so, so, fearful of being offended? They are prudish killjoys.", "NTA. I don't even understand what their hang up is. Dumb. I'm annoyed for you.", "So wait. You were all playing truth or dare and you were drinking.  \nNow the people involved were all out of college, where - i assume - they drank and partied pretty hard?  \nAnd they are clutching their pearls because they saw you running into the house and up the stairs in wet underwear?   \nAnd that made their eyes burn and fall out, bc they have never seen even the outline of any genitalia and you traumatized them with your scandalous actions and caused severe emotional turmoil, because they were able to see (dear god!) your penis and balls clinging to your wet underpants THROUGH the wet underpants?   \nAnd they were so shocked they could not cover their eyes fast enough? Because it was not clear that your underwear would get wet and then after reappearing from the wet water of indecency and impurity.... they might  see....OMG....people hold on, its so terrifyingly terrifying.... A PENIS through wet underwear.   \nIs this what we are talking about?  \n\n\nWTF...so NTA.", "NTA damn your friends should never go on holiday to Europe if *this* hurts their sensibilities", "Was one of them going to fish you out while you were weighted down by your cloths and suffering from hypothermia because you couldn\u2019t move??? NTA", "NTA. Your \"friends\" sound like a bunch of drama-queens. Oh and idiots: jumping in a lake during winter with full clothing is pretty dangerous, wouldn't be the first time someone gets pulled down due to soaked up clothes.\n\nYou're a guy, you got a penis and testicles, it's not like you were waving them around.....Do these people also object to woman breastfeeding in public?", "I am all with people wear whatever they want to wear within reason of course but think people should be a bit modest in their dress imo but I even think this is silly , he had underwear on if I have read correctly so what\u2019s the hubbub, they sound ridiculous, its a underwear and 5 secs of it. Geez. NTA.", "NTA lmao they expected you to jump into the water fully clothed? Are they not adults", "NTA And please ditch those uptight bores ASAP.\n\nI'm angry just imagining spending time with people like that. Yuk. \nLive your life my guy.", "What's the objective difference between underwear and a speedo?  Your friends sound like assholes.  NTA", "Lmao, right. *How* old are your friends? They ALL got that disturbed by seeing someone in their underwear?? Are y\u2019all super religious or something? I can\u2019t even imagine even 1 person getting upset over it. NTA, obviously X\u2019D. Unless there\u2019s some huge detail you\u2019re leaving out of this story. The whole thing seems bizarre to me..", "I did this once (altho it was a tropical winter) and half of my friends joined in?????", "Exactly", "Take my George Costanza upvote! (2nd one today).", "You mean like laundry?", "NTA. Underwear is fine, and swimming with clothes is heavy as hell and could drown you, especially if you've been drinking as well. Your friend over reacted.", "NTA. If you were a woman no one would have said anything", "They dared you to jump in a lake and couldn't foresee that might involve some amount of disrobing?\n\nNTA\n\n* It would make a dangerous situation much more dangerous to dive in fully clothed. Your clothes would be waterlogged and very heavy. You were already very drunk in freezing water, it's insane to make a sketchy situation worse for the sake of modesty.\n* It would be weird if you had packed a bathing suit. It would be annoying if, in the middle of the game, you completely derailed the momentum by like polling the group - ok should I take my pants off? Does anyone have athletic shorts I could borrow that you don't mind getting wet? Ok wait for me here while I go change.\n* What truth or dare game doesn't involve at least some partial nudity at some point? Why even play this game if that is uncomfortable? Or why didn't someone speak up after the dare was given, and before you did it? \"No, wait, can we change that dare? I'm not comfortable being nearby when anyone is taking off some clothes\"\n\nThis is weird, it honestly seems like someone was looking for something to be upset about.", "NTA They dared you.  I think it's your friends that are weird.", "You could have died over a prank, but sure, NTA.", "NTA I think it\u2019s normal when playing that game to be prepared for such things, it\u2019s not like you were naked", "What a nothingburger. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m a girl- I would have gone in naked \ud83d\ude05", "NTA.\n\nHow dramatic!\n\nI\u2019m a girl I grow up swimming at night in my underwear with my male friends doing the same, nobody did end up traumatized. It is not like at 24 they have never see other gender underwear.", "Your friends are uptight. NTA", "Nta.  You made it weird?  Your friends made it weird by making it weird and dramatic over nothing  Find some new friends.\n\nThey seem young and uptight.", "NTA. They sound lame.", "NTA- your friends are weird. A dare happens spontaneously.. you don\u2019t go prep to do it by putting on a suit if you had one. Wheres the fun in that?", "NTA What kind of a group is riske enough to play truth or dare, but then get butthurt when someone actually goes through with the dare? These people sound ridiculous.", "So they had problem with labeling and fabric because underwear and swimwear is like exactly the same thing but maybe with different fabrics. NTA of course, your friends are conservatives and really boring", "Next time take a pair of speedos. More revealing than normal underware but classed as swimwear. NTA", "Dramatic as hell extends to thinking that underwear, which would likely cover the exact same amount of skin as a bathing suit, is somehow more problematic just because it was designed for a different purpose.", "Seriously! What\u2019s the difference between underwear and a bathing suit other than fabric type? At least he wears underwear, they could have seen a lot more of him.", "It\u2019s your fault for being ugly. If you were hot none of the girls would\u2019ve cared. Your friends are AHs", "Not even then. People don't get to make a dare like that in winter no less, and then also make demands regarding what you wear.", "Wait. You were in your underwear? I thought you went naked. This is so absurd. NTA", "OP probably has 8 pack and the guy friends got jealous the girls were staring. Only explanation for the friends' ridiculous reaction.", "Colorado lake this time of year? That\u2019s an iceberg calving.", "Speedo is too tame, OP needs to go with a mankini.", "Maybe try and get a few sizes smaller without crushing anything important", "So? How prude can you be?\n\nNTA", "No, I think it's when the 'goods' literally pull up towards the body to conserve / use body heat in cold environments. Makes them look smaller. But also a girl and going off of second hand information.", "https://youtu.be/85MZ4c1EWkM", "Hahaha thanks for that!"]}
