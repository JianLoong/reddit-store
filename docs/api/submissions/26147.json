My wife is a stay at home mom and takes care of the house and chases after our 6 year old daughter.\n\nI\u2019ve been working in my field since 20 starting as an EMT, so after a decade and a half I became pretty desensitized to most gore, blood, death, and other horrific things. It wasn\u2019t ever really a problem with me until about a year ago. I\u2019m not sure why but something in me changed. I\u2019m pretty sure it has to do with fatherhood and my daughter being in school now and away from her mothers watchful eye and possibly a danger we can\u2019t save her from. Now seeing children come into the ER hits me different.\n\nA few weeks ago I had a particularly rough day after having a 7 year old patient and I decided to take a longer way home just so I have time to compartmentalize it all before getting home and going on daddy duty. I told my wife I missed my exit and had to go a long way around which turned my 15 minute commute to a 35-40 minute commute.\n\nI felt so much better getting home and seeing my daughter after this time. It\u2019s not a lot, but its enough to help me not take work home. I started doing this for days I had to see children, then to bad days in general, and for the last week, everyday.\n\nMy wife doesn\u2019t like  as it means she had to make dinner while entertaining our daughter which gets hectic. I feel that this benefits me and my daughter, I don\u2019t come home with what I saw fresh on my mind when talking to her so I feel I\u2019m more attentive and much less emotional drained/withdrawn.\n\nMy wife called me out on it recently and told me that she knows I\u2019m intentionally taking longer to go to work. She\u2019s been watching my location when I get off and sees me going the scenic route home. I tried to explain to her why I\u2019m doing it but she doesn\u2019t want to hear it. She told me that I\u2019m being selfish as she doesn\u2019t get a break all day and when I take extra time getting home, I\u2019m not helping her out like she needs to so she suffers.\n\nAdmittedly, I do feel bad about not helping her, but I feel that I really need this time. I don\u2019t want to devalue what she does, but she\u2019s talking about a breather after folding laundry and running errands. I need a breather after people come in with severe burns, car crash victims, bullet wounds, stabbings etc, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to compare.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693751390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168yhkq/aita_for_taking_an_extra_twenty_minutes_on_my_way/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife does not have a child hanging off her all day. I\u2019ve heard people in high stress jobs, particularly the medical field, do things to decompress. Also, what is with people being fine being tracked everywhere now days? It\u2019s creepy.  NTA", "HARD NTA. Your wife is a stay-at-home-mom. She has her daughter's school time to decompress (even though she also needs to do some housekeeping during that time but it's hardly something that requires 5 hours a day). You do not have your daughter's school time to decompress.\n\nI absolutely understand that she HAS a job, and it's being her daughter's mom and housekeeping. But you have TWO jobs, your money-earning job and your job as a dad in the evenings. She's being thoughtless and inconsiderate of your needs. You literally have a job from the minute you get up till the minute your daughter goes to sleep whereas your wife has time in the mornings.\n\nYou *deserve* those 20 minutes off your workload, and I'm saying that with all the respect I have for her as a SAHM.", "NTA.\n\nYes, your communication could have been better/more transparent.\n\nBut 20 minutes for self care at the end of a shift is super cheap insurance against burnout and needing to find a new career or developing a more serious issue with mental health where you can't work at all. This is a known risk in your profession and needs to be taken seriously.\n\nOn your spouse's end, she doesn't seem to be giving herself permission to take care of herself either and/or has too many self-imposed constraints. She's TA for not seeing any other solution here and not acknowledging that your job is also a pretty relentless one just like hers. She's needlessly making this a zero-sum where one of you has to suffer.\n\nShe seems to be putting artificial pressure on your family schedule. Dinner and the subsequent evening routine can be delayed by 20 minutes. Your daughter can watch a documentary of her choice for 30 minutes while you wife makes dinner, etc. Families with only children tend to spend way too much time serving their child's needs.\n\nA possible solution:\n\nOn your day off, schedule a good chunk of time for family meal prep. Your daughter is old enough to learn some basic kitchen skills. I'm a Montessori teacher and learning kitchen skills is part of the pre-K and kindergarten curriculum. Kids don't need to be entertained when they can be involved. As a family chop a bunch of vegetables, mix up marinades and sauces, make a big pot of soup. Then food prep is easier each evening and you have added a healthy family routine.", "Would she prefer you race home and have a few shots to unwind???   Yours is a healthy alternative!", "NTA - Was going to go with NAH until I saw she was tracking your movements.\n\nShe\u2019s not wrong to need some help but also understand that you witness some traumatic stuff daily. I think having the conversation after the first time would have been a better way to go about it.\n\nBut the tracking you is concerning.", "Your daughter is in school, what exactly does she need a break from?\n\nNTA", "NAH.  It's time to recreate your schedules so that you can decompress prior to entering the doors to your home and so that your wife gets her break.  While you're at, you may as well work on your communication skills as well: the very first time that you needed to decompress, you should have just told her. Your lying about what was really going on is what's created this mess in the first place.", "NTA.  Tell your wife you are doing it for your mental health and the health of the family as you will be no good if you don't have this time to decompress.\n\nMaybe it is time that your wife starts working outside of the house, part time at least, so that she can get out of the house and maybe understand the need to decompress sometimes.", "NTA. Both parents mental health is important, and as long as she is getting a break, I don't think adding an extra 20 or so minutes to your commute is a huge deal. I am a medical receptionist, and we have a few EMT patients that have mental health issues due to the things they've seen. It's horrible.", "NTA. It's 20 minutes ffs.", "NTA.  Good for you for recognizing the need to leave work behind when you arrive home, and taking the time to make that happen.  But don't compare your need for decompression to hers (which you are in fact doing).  The dinner hour can be a little crazy when there are small children in the mix.  Maybe your daughter could have an afternoon snack and dinner could be a little later when things are less intense.", "ESH.  Yes, you need the time.  But instead of communicating that to your wife, you lied.  Instead of communicating her suspicions, she tracked you.\n\nYou folks need to learn to talk to each other.", "No fucking offense to your wife. But there is no universe where stay at home mom of one child is as hard as triage nurse. NTA\n\nAlso, you obviously need some help. Therapy and maybe a break from work.\n\nMaybe cut down your hours, and she can get a job.", "NTA. I feel kinda mean saying this but what you do is a paid job with some really heavy-hitting experiences to witness and engage with. \n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t seem to understand how easy her \u201cjob\u201d is compared to yours. \n\nI\u2019d tell her that if she\u2019d like to swap anytime soon, she can \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, your daughters in school, she\u2019s 6 years old, your wife hardly has to spend all day caring for her \ud83d\ude44.", "YTA for lying about it. Your reasons are legit, but you should have learned as a child that lying about something is almost always worse than telling the truth. \n\nThis is your life partner, you should be able to talk about the issues you are working through. She shouldn't be pushing back so hard about it, but **when you start the discussion with a lie it's normal for the other person to come in hot.**", "NTA.  I\u2019m also a nurse and often take 10-15 min to just sit in my car after work to decompress before driving home. This was an an idea I discussed with my psychologist as it\u2019s the only time I get to myself for over 14 hours during my 12 hour shifts.", "Take the long way home,\nTake the long way home.", "NTA-your child is 6 and fully able to independently entertain herself (unless there are special needs not mentioned). Either way, your wife has a full school day to prep dinner as well.", "You do need decompression, it is very important for your mental health especially considering the type of work you are doing. But \"she had to make dinner while entertaining our daughter which gets hectic\" also needs to be addressed. Maybe you both could consider an option when your wife does not start making dinner until you come home? Or maybe you could come to an agreement on a timeslot for her to get some alone time too.", "NTA (although your communication could have been better) but this is bigger than I think you both realize. You are likely experiencing compassion fatigue, which is common in professions like yours. I have experienced it, and it will burn you out like nothing else if it continues to progress. \n\nI don't know what your relationship with your wife is normally like, what she understands about the things you see every day at work, how much empathy she has for it at times when she's not stressed about her own stuff, but she needs to understand the gravity of this situation as well. Compassion fatigue can escalate quickly and the depression it can cause is profound.\n\nThat said, it sounds like your wife is also feeling a bit overwhelmed at the moment. That may be fair as well, but it's leading to not being able to connect in your communication about what you need and why.\n\nI would recommend scheduling some vacation time soon if you can. Plan a staycation where you give your wife a break and spend some quality time just you and your daughter, as well as some time as a family all together. Simple things, not a big production. Please also consider seeking out a therapist who has experience with treating compassion fatigue. Read about it and see if it helps you explain to your wife that this isn't just about you wanting a break, this is something you are doing to preserve your mental health and ability to transition from a job where you see traumatic things on a daily basis, to coming home and being a fully present parent for your child. \n\nGood luck, and please take care of yourself.", "NTA. But maybe if you\u2019ve been more honest from the beginning about need to get your emotions in check, she might have been more understanding. Maybe she\u2019s more upset you didn\u2019t trust her enough to open up to her.", "NTA: Decompression time is beneficial for the family.\n\nYou should have, after that first one, come clean and said hey I want to be able to do this on the bad days though. :)  \n\nAlso, is there a <thing>  or chore or task or putting daughter to bed you can do to give your wife 30 minutes of quiet time in the evenings, or like few hours on a saturday morning (in lieu of the daily quiet time) so she gets some decompression time too?", "NTA. She calls you selfish but completely brushes off your feelings when you're working in a high stress job like that. So she's mad that you don't come home and make dinner instead of her, so SHE can get a break. I get that both of you work hard, and both deserve down time, but what's so wrong with you taking your time after work and then giving her time in the evening where she can go take a bath and unwind while you entertain the little one? That would be a compromise but she seems to just want you to not take your downtime. Also the fact that she's tracking your location is just downright weird and I'll never understand that in relationships how people can think that's normal.", "NTA - the wife is being extremely selfish, she needs to stop adding to husband already stressful day.\n\nFrom the Internet (and also personally knowing an EMT):\n\n paramedics develop worse physical and mental health conditions during their career than other employees with increased rates of mortality, occupational fatality, and early retirement. They are at increased risk of developing PTSD owing to work-related traumatic events.Mar 9, 2023", "Absolutely NTA.  You have a really difficult job and I\u2019d want to say YTA but to yourself if you didn\u2019t take some time to decompress. I\u2019m sad for you that you don\u2019t feel like you be honest with your wife- why is that?  You also sound like you could use some time off; I wonder if you\u2019re a little bit burnt out?", "NTA\n\nI'm a nurse too, i often sit in my car for 20m or half an hour before driving home just so I have time to breath and decompress \n\nHowever, help your wife, being a mum is a full time job too and one you don't get to clock off from. she needs time to decompress too", "Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.  You are definitely dealing with a lot and I think taking time to decompress will help a lot.  I'm sorry your wife isn't understanding.\n\nMaybe a compromise?  You take your breather by taking a long way home, then you get 100% of your daughter while Mom goes off and does her thing for a bit.\n\nI wonder if some couples therapy may help here.  I know a lot of first responders don't like to bring stuff home so she may not be aware of everything you're dealing with and how it's affecting you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA fellow nurse here. I understand your why. My family knows I am off duty after work. Bring me a water peanut butter sandwich and leave me alone.  Make sure she get time off on your day off. If she\u2019s still not satisfied go to marriage counseling.", "NAH. This is just a delicate situation that needs good conversation and good compromise between partners.\n\nYour wife isn\u2019t wrong for wanting you to come home relatively promptly after work on a regular basis. On odd occasions where you have a rough day ofc there should be an understanding that you need more time, but if this has become more of an everyday thing, then it is selfish - as your wife has said, it burdens her with more of the evening childcare, following a full day of childcare.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re also not wrong for having your needs. Lying to your wife about it wasn\u2019t ideal, but nor is it the worst thing in the world. Your job is stressful and particularly if it relates to children, you want clear separation between work and home life.\n\nYou need to have the discussion and find a compromise. But as it currently stands, you have all the power, as your wife can\u2019t force you to drive the quicker route home - so you need to put the effort into driving that conversation.", "I\u2019d say YTA for not explaining why right from the beginning, but NTA for doing it. I totally get why you do it as my sister is a nurse,  however lying about it is a problem.", "YTA for lying\n\nTell her you need to decompress so she isn\u2019t waiting and if something urgent is happening on her side you can adjust", "NTA. The kid's in school, so what does she need a break from doing \"all day?\" Household chores do not take all day. And tracking you is so controlling. You're coming home 20 minutes later from a stressful job so you can be more present for your family. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA, but your decompression time needs to be put properly into your family's schedule. And that might mean postponing dinner 30 mins, or immediately taking over when you do get home so your wife can get some space. \nAfter school time can be really exhausting for sahms, so no matter how much down time your wife does get during the day, any peace she had is going to be erased by the 6 year old after school. \nAs for looking at things differently, you may want to start looking around at working for different departments before you really get traumatized. And maybe something closer to your kid's school. Maybe the school district is hiring a nurse?  \nBecoming a parent does change your view 1000%.", "NAH - you should have told her sooner but you're not sn asshole. You're a guy in a tough job trying to deal. \n\nTherapy maybe wouldn't hurt if you can afford the time and money,  but otherwise it sounds like you're doing what you need to manage. \n\nI get why she's upset you didn't tell her what was going on though and she's not being an AH either, imo.", "She\u2019s a stay at home. Literally her job. She can decompress from her rough life when the child\u2019s asleep", "NAH don\u2019t feel like either of you is 100% in the wrong.  I get why you need decompressing time and it\u2019s probably better for the whole family that you have some but lying to your wife and not discussing it and giving her a chance for feedback on what\u2019s going on with her is bound to make her feel disrespected.", "Your lives are not equivalent. She gets a kid off to school and does some household tasks for 6 hours a day for a family of 3.  You spend 8 hours a day working in a high stress life and death environment to provide the only financial income for a family of 3.  She whines she can\u2019t make dinner and manage. 6 year old??? How about making dinner while kid is in school or telling kid to do homework/watch tv/help her instead of stalking you and throwing a tantrum that you took an extra 30 minutes to yourself??? NTA", "I didn\u2019t think anyone ita here until that last paragraph. You said you didn\u2019t want to devalue what she does but in the next breath did that exact thing. It is perfectly normal to feel the need to take a breath before going home but you need to recognize how this effects wife. You have an emotionally draining job and financially provide for your family. Your wife handles the emotional labor/weight of your family (also very draining), childcare, home care. Both important to your life. \n\nAlso recognize that everyone\u2019s definition of a hard day is different. It\u2019s likely that you would feel just as drained doing your wife\u2019s job as she would be doing yours. I couldn\u2019t handle my husbands job and he couldn\u2019t handle mine. \u201cRunning errands\u201d with a child isn\u2019t as simple as just hopping in the car and going. Maybe your wife is overstimulated and touched out and overwhelmed. You have the opportunity to talk to other adults all day. Feel productive. Use a different part of your brain other than trying to be \u201chappy mom\u201d all day. Is it possible she could also need that extra 15 minutes to decompress? You both deserve and need that time but a genuine question is, what opportunities does she have to get it? Have you told her how much you value her work in the home?\nThis is one of those situations where perception is reality.\n\n*I commented this on your other post and still stand by it.*", "ESH  I really am leaning on the n t a side though. You should have been honest to your wife for family security purposes and as much as she does her part, and as much as you love her... perhaps she needs to be humbled as to why you require a cool down from what you do and decide to take a little time to yourself. She should watch a few ER videos of a parents worst nightmare which should kinda put things into perspective a little more as to why your concerns should be valid, but this is also what you do and if it bothers you to that point maybe find something a little less engaging if that's possible unless absolutely necessary.\n\nAs for your daughter suffering, it honestly seems like she is doing pretty well. She has both parents, an opportunity to have an education, a wonderful house to live in and a dad who is now in a position where if the absolute worst thing happens to her where she would need immediate attention, you have enough experience to hopefully prevent any more trauma. Just seems like a little more family time is needed in general if you all can plan for that.", "NTAH. My fianc\u00e9 does this as well.

Like she felt you were being dishonest? \n\nPartnerships are about working as a team, and leaving her out of the the decision to take the time to decompress after work had her at home wondering what is going on.

My husband often stops to shoot hoops on his way home or goes on a bike ride once home.

It\u2019s 20 minutes. 20 extra minutes a day to decompress from what you\u2019ve seen.

Last year she ran up over 100 hours of time owed because of this.

Trust has been broken, so it makes sense that she's suspicious of the truth being bullshit. Hopefully she'll be able to get past it soon, and they can have a discussion about how to avoid this kind of misunderstanding in the future.\n\nTo be clear, I don't think anyone is being an asshole, this is just really sad all around.

I know what he is seeing and facing and it can be hauntingly challenging.  On days he needs more time allow it.  Then once home, he can pick up the slack and she can relax.  A six year old is usually in bed by 8-8:30.  Maybe dad can do bath and bed time on nights he takes the long way home. \nI will say it: yes, a triage nurse seeing children abused, killed at the hands of abuse, mangled and killed from auto accidents is absolutely more damaging than what his wife handles at home.
