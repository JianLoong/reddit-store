My wife is a stay at home mom and takes care of the house and chases after our 6 year old daughter.\n\nI\u2019ve been working in my field since 20 starting as an EMT, so after a decade and a half I became pretty desensitized to most gore, blood, death, and other horrific things. It wasn\u2019t ever really a problem with me until about a year ago. I\u2019m not sure why but something in me changed. I\u2019m pretty sure it has to do with fatherhood and my daughter being in school now and away from her mothers watchful eye and possibly a danger we can\u2019t save her from. Now seeing children come into the ER hits me different.\n\nA few weeks ago I had a particularly rough day after having a 7 year old patient and I decided to take a longer way home just so I have time to compartmentalize it all before getting home and going on daddy duty. I told my wife I missed my exit and had to go a long way around which turned my 15 minute commute to a 35-40 minute commute.\n\nI felt so much better getting home and seeing my daughter after this time. It\u2019s not a lot, but its enough to help me not take work home. I started doing this for days I had to see children, then to bad days in general, and for the last week, everyday.\n\nMy wife doesn\u2019t like  as it means she had to make dinner while entertaining our daughter which gets hectic. I feel that this benefits me and my daughter, I don\u2019t come home with what I saw fresh on my mind when talking to her so I feel I\u2019m more attentive and much less emotional drained/withdrawn.\n\nMy wife called me out on it recently and told me that she knows I\u2019m intentionally taking longer to go to work. She\u2019s been watching my location when I get off and sees me going the scenic route home. I tried to explain to her why I\u2019m doing it but she doesn\u2019t want to hear it. She told me that I\u2019m being selfish as she doesn\u2019t get a break all day and when I take extra time getting home, I\u2019m not helping her out like she needs to so she suffers.\n\nAdmittedly, I do feel bad about not helping her, but I feel that I really need this time. I don\u2019t want to devalue what she does, but she\u2019s talking about a breather after folding laundry and running errands. I need a breather after people come in with severe burns, car crash victims, bullet wounds, stabbings etc, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to compare.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693751390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168yhkq/aita_for_taking_an_extra_twenty_minutes_on_my_way/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife does not have a child hanging off her all day. I\u2019ve heard people in high stress jobs, particularly the medical field, do things to decompress. Also, what is with people being fine being tracked everywhere now days? It\u2019s creepy.  NTA", "HARD NTA. Your wife is a stay-at-home-mom. She has her daughter's school time to decompress (even though she also needs to do some housekeeping during that time but it's hardly something that requires 5 hours a day). You do not have your daughter's school time to decompress.\n\nI absolutely understand that she HAS a job, and it's being her daughter's mom and housekeeping. But you have TWO jobs, your money-earning job and your job as a dad in the evenings. She's being thoughtless and inconsiderate of your needs. You literally have a job from the minute you get up till the minute your daughter goes to sleep whereas your wife has time in the mornings.\n\nYou *deserve* those 20 minutes off your workload, and I'm saying that with all the respect I have for her as a SAHM.", "NTA.\n\nYes, your communication could have been better/more transparent.\n\nBut 20 minutes for self care at the end of a shift is super cheap insurance against burnout and needing to find a new career or developing a more serious issue with mental health where you can't work at all. This is a known risk in your profession and needs to be taken seriously.\n\nOn your spouse's end, she doesn't seem to be giving herself permission to take care of herself either and/or has too many self-imposed constraints. She's TA for not seeing any other solution here and not acknowledging that your job is also a pretty relentless one just like hers. She's needlessly making this a zero-sum where one of you has to suffer.\n\nShe seems to be putting artificial pressure on your family schedule. Dinner and the subsequent evening routine can be delayed by 20 minutes. Your daughter can watch a documentary of her choice for 30 minutes while you wife makes dinner, etc. Families with only children tend to spend way too much time serving their child's needs.\n\nA possible solution:\n\nOn your day off, schedule a good chunk of time for family meal prep. Your daughter is old enough to learn some basic kitchen skills. I'm a Montessori teacher and learning kitchen skills is part of the pre-K and kindergarten curriculum. Kids don't need to be entertained when they can be involved. As a family chop a bunch of vegetables, mix up marinades and sauces, make a big pot of soup. Then food prep is easier each evening and you have added a healthy family routine.", "Would she prefer you race home and have a few shots to unwind???   Yours is a healthy alternative!", "NTA - Was going to go with NAH until I saw she was tracking your movements.\n\nShe\u2019s not wrong to need some help but also understand that you witness some traumatic stuff daily. I think having the conversation after the first time would have been a better way to go about it.\n\nBut the tracking you is concerning.", "Your daughter is in school, what exactly does she need a break from?\n\nNTA", "NAH.  It's time to recreate your schedules so that you can decompress prior to entering the doors to your home and so that your wife gets her break.  While you're at, you may as well work on your communication skills as well: the very first time that you needed to decompress, you should have just told her. Your lying about what was really going on is what's created this mess in the first place.", "NTA.  Tell your wife you are doing it for your mental health and the health of the family as you will be no good if you don't have this time to decompress.\n\nMaybe it is time that your wife starts working outside of the house, part time at least, so that she can get out of the house and maybe understand the need to decompress sometimes.", "NTA. Both parents mental health is important, and as long as she is getting a break, I don't think adding an extra 20 or so minutes to your commute is a huge deal. I am a medical receptionist, and we have a few EMT patients that have mental health issues due to the things they've seen. It's horrible.", "NTA. It's 20 minutes ffs.", "NTA.  Good for you for recognizing the need to leave work behind when you arrive home, and taking the time to make that happen.  But don't compare your need for decompression to hers (which you are in fact doing).  The dinner hour can be a little crazy when there are small children in the mix.  Maybe your daughter could have an afternoon snack and dinner could be a little later when things are less intense.", "ESH.  Yes, you need the time.  But instead of communicating that to your wife, you lied.  Instead of communicating her suspicions, she tracked you.\n\nYou folks need to learn to talk to each other.", "No fucking offense to your wife. But there is no universe where stay at home mom of one child is as hard as triage nurse. NTA\n\nAlso, you obviously need some help. Therapy and maybe a break from work.\n\nMaybe cut down your hours, and she can get a job.", "NTA. I feel kinda mean saying this but what you do is a paid job with some really heavy-hitting experiences to witness and engage with. \n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t seem to understand how easy her \u201cjob\u201d is compared to yours. \n\nI\u2019d tell her that if she\u2019d like to swap anytime soon, she can \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, your daughters in school, she\u2019s 6 years old, your wife hardly has to spend all day caring for her \ud83d\ude44.", "YTA for lying about it. Your reasons are legit, but you should have learned as a child that lying about something is almost always worse than telling the truth. \n\nThis is your life partner, you should be able to talk about the issues you are working through. She shouldn't be pushing back so hard about it, but **when you start the discussion with a lie it's normal for the other person to come in hot.**", "NTA.  I\u2019m also a nurse and often take 10-15 min to just sit in my car after work to decompress before driving home. This was an an idea I discussed with my psychologist as it\u2019s the only time I get to myself for over 14 hours during my 12 hour shifts.", "Take the long way home,\nTake the long way home.", "NTA-your child is 6 and fully able to independently entertain herself (unless there are special needs not mentioned). Either way, your wife has a full school day to prep dinner as well.", "You do need decompression, it is very important for your mental health especially considering the type of work you are doing. But \"she had to make dinner while entertaining our daughter which gets hectic\" also needs to be addressed. Maybe you both could consider an option when your wife does not start making dinner until you come home? Or maybe you could come to an agreement on a timeslot for her to get some alone time too.", "NTA (although your communication could have been better) but this is bigger than I think you both realize. You are likely experiencing compassion fatigue, which is common in professions like yours. I have experienced it, and it will burn you out like nothing else if it continues to progress. \n\nI don't know what your relationship with your wife is normally like, what she understands about the things you see every day at work, how much empathy she has for it at times when she's not stressed about her own stuff, but she needs to understand the gravity of this situation as well. Compassion fatigue can escalate quickly and the depression it can cause is profound.\n\nThat said, it sounds like your wife is also feeling a bit overwhelmed at the moment. That may be fair as well, but it's leading to not being able to connect in your communication about what you need and why.\n\nI would recommend scheduling some vacation time soon if you can. Plan a staycation where you give your wife a break and spend some quality time just you and your daughter, as well as some time as a family all together. Simple things, not a big production. Please also consider seeking out a therapist who has experience with treating compassion fatigue. Read about it and see if it helps you explain to your wife that this isn't just about you wanting a break, this is something you are doing to preserve your mental health and ability to transition from a job where you see traumatic things on a daily basis, to coming home and being a fully present parent for your child. \n\nGood luck, and please take care of yourself.", "NTA. But maybe if you\u2019ve been more honest from the beginning about need to get your emotions in check, she might have been more understanding. Maybe she\u2019s more upset you didn\u2019t trust her enough to open up to her.", "NTA: Decompression time is beneficial for the family.\n\nYou should have, after that first one, come clean and said hey I want to be able to do this on the bad days though. :)  \n\nAlso, is there a <thing>  or chore or task or putting daughter to bed you can do to give your wife 30 minutes of quiet time in the evenings, or like few hours on a saturday morning (in lieu of the daily quiet time) so she gets some decompression time too?", "NTA. She calls you selfish but completely brushes off your feelings when you're working in a high stress job like that. So she's mad that you don't come home and make dinner instead of her, so SHE can get a break. I get that both of you work hard, and both deserve down time, but what's so wrong with you taking your time after work and then giving her time in the evening where she can go take a bath and unwind while you entertain the little one? That would be a compromise but she seems to just want you to not take your downtime. Also the fact that she's tracking your location is just downright weird and I'll never understand that in relationships how people can think that's normal.", "NTA - the wife is being extremely selfish, she needs to stop adding to husband already stressful day.\n\nFrom the Internet (and also personally knowing an EMT):\n\n paramedics develop worse physical and mental health conditions during their career than other employees with increased rates of mortality, occupational fatality, and early retirement. They are at increased risk of developing PTSD owing to work-related traumatic events.Mar 9, 2023", "Absolutely NTA.  You have a really difficult job and I\u2019d want to say YTA but to yourself if you didn\u2019t take some time to decompress. I\u2019m sad for you that you don\u2019t feel like you be honest with your wife- why is that?  You also sound like you could use some time off; I wonder if you\u2019re a little bit burnt out?", "NTA\n\nI'm a nurse too, i often sit in my car for 20m or half an hour before driving home just so I have time to breath and decompress \n\nHowever, help your wife, being a mum is a full time job too and one you don't get to clock off from. she needs time to decompress too", "Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.  You are definitely dealing with a lot and I think taking time to decompress will help a lot.  I'm sorry your wife isn't understanding.\n\nMaybe a compromise?  You take your breather by taking a long way home, then you get 100% of your daughter while Mom goes off and does her thing for a bit.\n\nI wonder if some couples therapy may help here.  I know a lot of first responders don't like to bring stuff home so she may not be aware of everything you're dealing with and how it's affecting you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA fellow nurse here. I understand your why. My family knows I am off duty after work. Bring me a water peanut butter sandwich and leave me alone.  Make sure she get time off on your day off. If she\u2019s still not satisfied go to marriage counseling.", "NAH. This is just a delicate situation that needs good conversation and good compromise between partners.\n\nYour wife isn\u2019t wrong for wanting you to come home relatively promptly after work on a regular basis. On odd occasions where you have a rough day ofc there should be an understanding that you need more time, but if this has become more of an everyday thing, then it is selfish - as your wife has said, it burdens her with more of the evening childcare, following a full day of childcare.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re also not wrong for having your needs. Lying to your wife about it wasn\u2019t ideal, but nor is it the worst thing in the world. Your job is stressful and particularly if it relates to children, you want clear separation between work and home life.\n\nYou need to have the discussion and find a compromise. But as it currently stands, you have all the power, as your wife can\u2019t force you to drive the quicker route home - so you need to put the effort into driving that conversation.", "I\u2019d say YTA for not explaining why right from the beginning, but NTA for doing it. I totally get why you do it as my sister is a nurse,  however lying about it is a problem.", "YTA for lying\n\nTell her you need to decompress so she isn\u2019t waiting and if something urgent is happening on her side you can adjust", "NTA. The kid's in school, so what does she need a break from doing \"all day?\" Household chores do not take all day. And tracking you is so controlling. You're coming home 20 minutes later from a stressful job so you can be more present for your family. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA, but your decompression time needs to be put properly into your family's schedule. And that might mean postponing dinner 30 mins, or immediately taking over when you do get home so your wife can get some space. \nAfter school time can be really exhausting for sahms, so no matter how much down time your wife does get during the day, any peace she had is going to be erased by the 6 year old after school. \nAs for looking at things differently, you may want to start looking around at working for different departments before you really get traumatized. And maybe something closer to your kid's school. Maybe the school district is hiring a nurse?  \nBecoming a parent does change your view 1000%.", "NAH - you should have told her sooner but you're not sn asshole. You're a guy in a tough job trying to deal. \n\nTherapy maybe wouldn't hurt if you can afford the time and money,  but otherwise it sounds like you're doing what you need to manage. \n\nI get why she's upset you didn't tell her what was going on though and she's not being an AH either, imo.", "She\u2019s a stay at home. Literally her job. She can decompress from her rough life when the child\u2019s asleep", "NAH don\u2019t feel like either of you is 100% in the wrong.  I get why you need decompressing time and it\u2019s probably better for the whole family that you have some but lying to your wife and not discussing it and giving her a chance for feedback on what\u2019s going on with her is bound to make her feel disrespected.", "Your lives are not equivalent. She gets a kid off to school and does some household tasks for 6 hours a day for a family of 3.  You spend 8 hours a day working in a high stress life and death environment to provide the only financial income for a family of 3.  She whines she can\u2019t make dinner and manage. 6 year old??? How about making dinner while kid is in school or telling kid to do homework/watch tv/help her instead of stalking you and throwing a tantrum that you took an extra 30 minutes to yourself??? NTA", "I didn\u2019t think anyone ita here until that last paragraph. You said you didn\u2019t want to devalue what she does but in the next breath did that exact thing. It is perfectly normal to feel the need to take a breath before going home but you need to recognize how this effects wife. You have an emotionally draining job and financially provide for your family. Your wife handles the emotional labor/weight of your family (also very draining), childcare, home care. Both important to your life. \n\nAlso recognize that everyone\u2019s definition of a hard day is different. It\u2019s likely that you would feel just as drained doing your wife\u2019s job as she would be doing yours. I couldn\u2019t handle my husbands job and he couldn\u2019t handle mine. \u201cRunning errands\u201d with a child isn\u2019t as simple as just hopping in the car and going. Maybe your wife is overstimulated and touched out and overwhelmed. You have the opportunity to talk to other adults all day. Feel productive. Use a different part of your brain other than trying to be \u201chappy mom\u201d all day. Is it possible she could also need that extra 15 minutes to decompress? You both deserve and need that time but a genuine question is, what opportunities does she have to get it? Have you told her how much you value her work in the home?\nThis is one of those situations where perception is reality.\n\n*I commented this on your other post and still stand by it.*", "ESH  I really am leaning on the n t a side though. You should have been honest to your wife for family security purposes and as much as she does her part, and as much as you love her... perhaps she needs to be humbled as to why you require a cool down from what you do and decide to take a little time to yourself. She should watch a few ER videos of a parents worst nightmare which should kinda put things into perspective a little more as to why your concerns should be valid, but this is also what you do and if it bothers you to that point maybe find something a little less engaging if that's possible unless absolutely necessary.\n\nAs for your daughter suffering, it honestly seems like she is doing pretty well. She has both parents, an opportunity to have an education, a wonderful house to live in and a dad who is now in a position where if the absolute worst thing happens to her where she would need immediate attention, you have enough experience to hopefully prevent any more trauma. Just seems like a little more family time is needed in general if you all can plan for that.", "NTAH. My fianc\u00e9 does this as well.

Maybe dad can do bath and bed time on nights he takes the long way home. \nI will say it: yes, a triage nurse seeing children abused, killed at the hands of abuse, mangled and killed from auto accidents is absolutely more damaging than what his wife handles at home.

His wife didn\u2019t react like that for no reason and clearly he isn\u2019t an a**hole so he needs to talk to her and figure out what\u2019s going on.", ">houses \n\nWhat? She\u2019s a SAHM. One house. And Jesus Christ\u2026have you seen nurses work? Unless she\u2019s not eating, she\u2019s getting as much of a break as OP during the day. The long ride home is to process fucking trauma before looking at his wife and kid so they don\u2019t see the weight of it on his face.

You ARE saying their jobs are equal when in reality they are not even close. \n\nThe wife HAS downtime when the child is at school. She doesn\u2019t have to run errands every day. She doesn\u2019t have to do vacuuming all day. Which those are normal household things everybody does every day. Cleaning the house is not a job, it\u2019s part of daily life. Being a sahm and watching their daughter IS her job and she does get downtime from her job bc of school. She gets downtime when OP comes home and takes care of their child and spends time with her. Hell, she can nap and pee when their child is at school if she wants. \n\nOP barely gets bathroom breaks. They barely get to eat their lunches/drink water (not that they want to bc then they have to pee and usually don\u2019t get to)/have a rest at work. They are ALWAYS on. Do you seriously not know anything about hospital workers?!\n\n20 extra minutes for OP to decompress and try to forget the HORRORS he\u2019s seen all day is WORTH the delay. There\u2019s a reason most emergency workers attend therapy or have to find outlets.\n\nStop comparing the two, which IS what you\u2019re doing.", "You're the one making wild claims that a SAHP does 120 hours of work a week lol. I'd say my experience is closer to the average than that absurd claim.", "Why are you being so aggressive to everyone on here?", "This is shit everyone has to do that's an adult. Married or not. Parent or not. She's not doing anything outside of what every human does daily.", "Sure, mysoginist.", "It\u2019s valuable because it differs from mine.  I can only relate to OP in this and not the perspective of a SAHM.  I too have taken the long way home so to speak to decompress.  I read the comment I responded to as sarcastic.  It\u2019s ok, calm down", "Perfect response and thank you for being a Nurse.", "Perfect response and thank you for being a Nurse.", "Perfect response and thank you for being a Nurse.", "My husband and I will often use the tracking to see how long it's likely to be until the other is home, if I did so and realised he'd actively lied to me I'd feel hurt, it's not tracking like a bounty hunter. \"I need to check if I can afford to wait until he gets home to start dinner or if it's not worth bothering because he's too far out\" isn't nearly as nefarious as you seem to think.", "I think that when a partner normally gets home at x time and then they randomly start getting home 45 mins later; it's normal to be concerned. There are way to many situations where a spouse/SO trusted way beyond all the red flags. Even though he has a valid reason; I think it's normal to be concerned and check the validity of his stories.", "Are you kidding me? There\u2019s no help for women in fact, when  women expressing understanding how about what he\u2019s done is being received you\u2019re on top trying to shut down it all as  as invalid, so no, it\u2019s not easier for women they just aren\u2019t  cowards about saying the hard things in spite of how they will be treated .", "That\u2019s convenient.  \n\nNo matter which way a woman responds to his actions he gets to\nBe the victim.

And how could you possibly know what her day consists of?? It\u2019s so ignorant to think you know everything based off a couple of paragraphs. My point is that she does work and everyone needs time to decompress. Newsflash every job is different I have friends that work in hospitals and they get breaks but yes some places don\u2019t because they are short staffed or are too busy. Once again though YOU DONT KNOW THESE PEOPLE the only thing we know about them is the information in the post. Also I never said he shouldn\u2019t take the extra time to decompress after work you are literally making stuff up. So you can come back when you\u2019re ready to talk about what I ACTUALLY said.", "Yeah well most people aren\u2019t like you who cleans and run errands to decompress.", "Yeah this nonsense about how she has to \u201centertain\u201d the kid while she cooks dinner\u2026is she serious? You tell a non-developmentally disabled child that she needs to go in her room and play with her toys for a little while so mommy can make dinner. Or play in the living room, or watch Dora the explorer, or do homework worksheets, whatever. \n\nI don\u2019t understand this at all. I was raised in a loving home but never expected my mother to entertain me while she was getting tasks done. What is with parents nowadays?", "How exactly?? I\u2019m not making it a competition by explaining why they both deserve time to themselves to decompress from the day. Everyone here is acting like a stay at home mom doesn\u2019t need time to decompress. If he thinks that little of his wife and her contributions to the family then why is he with her?", "Wild claims? Google is free so maybe you should use it before saying someone is making wild claims. Again you don\u2019t speak on behalf of all stay at home parents and the responsibilities of a stay at home parent varies from family to family. There are a lot of factors that go into how much work a stay at home parent does each day.", "How were they being aggressive?", "Never did I say her feelings are invalid. But nice try. \n\nAnd there are literally mental health facilities exclusively for women there are tons of help for women it\u2019s promoted.", "It's not this serious either.", "Is there any part of you that's willing to admit the stay at home Mother likely isn't cleaning and running errands for 6 hours straight 5 days a week when the child is at school.", "You're assuming that she used that entire time to do chores, and that she can't do any chores when the kid gets home", "Pretty sure she finds 15 mins or more to decompress every day. I call BS that\u2019s she\u2019s doing something productive ALL day long.", "Somehow my husband is able to handle cooking for our 2 year old when I'm away for 2 weeks. He works part time. Meal preps when he gets home. Then Picks her up from daycare and finishes cooking. He has her color. Watch her iPad, or play with her cooking utensils. A 2 year old is a whole hell of a lot harder to cook with than a 6 year old. Who you can have HELP.", "So the wife and the child need to try harder but the man gets a pass. He\u2019s literally the only baby in the equation.

Hey, I need to  decompress on my way home from work how can we make this work with our schedule? Literally doing mountains of work to avoid having the conversation that then turns into a massive fucking conversation and an never ending one. It\u2019s so stupid and shortsighted.", "You keep saying \u201cit\u2019s promoted\u201d and that\u2019s not wielding the rhetorical force you think it is", "Thank you! Like, we all know soap operas were invented bc SAHMs didn\u2019t have enough to do once the kids were in school. If my mom had time to watch Days of Our Lives and General Hospital I\u2019m sure todays SAHMs can pick a half hour to draw a bath or light a candle and do some yoga or whatever the hell they like to do. How clean do the baseboards really need to be?!", "Some do some don\u2019t but we only have a tiny bit of information to go off of so none of us could possibly know how much time she spends cleaning, shopping, cooking, managing finances and doing childcare each day. So just like I can\u2019t say for sure how much time she\u2019s working you can\u2019t say for sure how much free time she has. There\u2019s many factors that go into determining how much work a stay at home mom has each day and we don\u2019t have that information. So yes I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of stay at home parents that aren\u2019t working the entire time. My point with these comments is that we don\u2019t know enough to automatically decide that she doesn\u2019t need time for herself at the end of the day. They should discuss this with each other and come to a compromise. Of course he\u2019s not an A hole for needing time to himself but neither is she. He should talk to her instead of getting advice from strangers who don\u2019t have all the information.", "Maybe she can maybe she can\u2019t. I don\u2019t understand why yall are acting like you know these peoples whole life story after reading this post.", "It\u2019s crazy to me that so many people want to act like they know these people personally. You have no idea what her days consist of so you can guess but you don\u2019t know.

We don\u2019t know that about the wife though! Maybe she\u2019s like those people and it\u2019s relaxing for her or maybe not \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (btw with my previous comment I wasn\u2019t implying that no one feels that way i just feel like the people that do are the minority)", "Wow, that\u2019s awesome! I wouldn\u2019t expect you could ask that much of a 2 year old! I\u2019d have cut OP\u2019s wife more slack if she were trying to deal with a toddler.", "The OP? Yeah, in this situation, he gets a pass from me. Should he have told her about taking the long way home to decompress? Yes, he should have. But, sounds like the wife needs to be more understanding here. \n\nUnless he\u2019s left some material facts out of his post, OP\u2019s wife really doesn\u2019t have a whole hell of a lot to handle. The wife is SAHM and they have one ordinary 6 yr old daughter who presumably goes to school during the day. She should be able to handle cooking dinner with one child in the house.", "There are a lot of factors that go into determining how much a stay at home mom works. The size of the house, if the child has any disabilities or health problems, how much homework help the child needs, how many extra circular activities the child has, if the husband helps with anything or if everything related to the house and kid is 100% her responsibility etc. not to mention if she\u2019s struggling with her mental health (which is common in stay at home parents) these tasks may take longer to do than they normally would. Life isn\u2019t black and white there\u2019s a lot of different things to consider.", "That wasn\u2019t the point of me saying that \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f people are acting like stay at home moms just sit around all day so I gave the number from the study to show that they do work a lot on average. Again this isn\u2019t a competition I\u2019m not saying she has it worse than him I\u2019m saying they both deserve time to decompress. Maybe he needs more time than her the point is none of us know and he needs to talk to his wife and see why she had that reaction.", "Id love to know what you\u2019re typing in then because I searched \u201chow many hours do stay-at-home moms work a week on average\u201d and everything coming up is on par with what i said\u2026.", "Because nobody needs the life story to know there is no way she uses the entire time the kid is at school soley for chores unless she's scrubbing the floor with a toothbrush everyday. In which case OP is still not at fault for that", "Just have to get her interested in something and pop back and forth to show you're not ignoring her. It does take some effort, but it's not impossible. \n\nNow some kids are harder. And some days are harder. That's when you choose your battles. It's okay to push dinner back a little bit.", "Im sure he HAS left a lot out since that seems to be his standard operation procedure\u2026..\n\n\nLittle hard for the wife to be \u201cunderstanding \u201c when she is being lied to.    I mean how is that supposed to look ?  \u201cOh you poor dear you lied to me how can I help you now that you have completely devalued our relationship?\u201d   \n\nI swear the shenanigans and contortions some men will go through to avoid being an adult and forthright \u2026.", "This comment is an example of how you\u2019re making it a competition.", "Okay bud, you know everything and you know exactly how much free time she has each day. Life isn\u2019t black and white and you do need more information than what was given to make any judgements about the wife. Btw OP wasn\u2019t asking if he was at fault for anything he was asking if he was the a**hole which clearly he\u2019s not so idk what\u2019s the point of your last sentence", "\u201cCompletely devalued our relationship\u201d is going it a bit much, isn\u2019t it? She can see where he is. She knows he\u2019s just taking the scenic route. He\u2019s not cheating or doing anything nefarious. \n\nAs far as being forthright, he should be, but idk how the wife responds to reasonable requests. She can\u2019t handle cooking dinner with her 6 year old child present in the house, and she\u2019s not working, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "How is me saying she deserves time to decompress and that they need to talk and find a compromise making it a competition?? If the study said it\u2019s equivalent to one full time job I would\u2019ve stated that because again it\u2019s not a competition. All I was getting at is that being a stay at home mom is a job and they don\u2019t just sit around all day and anyone who has a job needs time to decompress. It\u2019s ridiculous to compare jobs, they both work and contribute to the family and they both need time to decompress end of story."]}
