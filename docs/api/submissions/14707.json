Your sister doesn't want a relationship with you or her neglectful parents. She's been waiting for the day to go to college so she had a chance to get out of that environment as fast as possible. \nShe was practically locked and keyed away because the child with the disability said so. And it's not your fault since you were just a kid, your parents are entirely at fault there. But your sister was isolated, probably had to decline every birthday party invite so often where her school friends just stopped asking her to go; she didn't get a childhood. \nShe might hate you entirely for being the reason why your parents forced her to stay home 24/7. This is 100% neglect that your sister experienced. She finally got out of a terrible situation, and you want to drag her BACK? Absolutely not!\n I sincerely feel for your sister as I was also a glass child and terribly neglected almost the same way. But you don't get to choose to bring her back. All you needed to do is apologize for what you asked for as a kid; let her know that you begged your parents to let her have a life and your parents declined and that's IT. Applying to her college and trying to chase after it, sending \"100s of emails\" was taking it way too far. If she didn't respond to the first one or two, she made her choice or not wanting to be your sister.  \nShe rightfully hates your family and it's time you accept that you had neglectful parents and move on. And don't go to her college. There's thousands of colleges and universities you can attend. \nIf she wants to reconcile the relationship, she'll come to you. But you became TA when you decided to disrespect her boundaries, decided to send \"100s of emails\", and then showing up to her college. \n\nYTA - though I feel for your want of apologizing.

There may be hope for you to restore a relationship with her but forcing it, and invading the space she has finally been able to establish for herself, is the worst possible way to do it. It sounds like you gained some maturity during your illness and tried to do right by her, but to her you were a tremendously, and unfairly, limiting factor that impacted her childhood very negatively. It's hard to understand why you would think going to her university and effectively forcing yourself on someone who has made it clear she wants no relationship would be a good choice. \n\nYou should transfer out immediately, and at some point in the future send her one last message that apologizes, explains you no longer go to school there and want to give her space, but that you hope she'll find it in her heart someday to talk to you about your childhoods. You could try to get across that you tried to influence your parents for the better, and maybe she'll come around. Or maybe she won't, and that's her prerogative.", "YTA - I get as a kid you did not understand what strain you caused, but you did and tried to fix it. But as you said, it was too late.

I don't blame you for what happened when you were kids; even when you pushed for your sister to stay with you, your parents were ultimately responsible for not stepping in and protecting your sister's wellbeing. But now? \n\nThink about it like this: your sister was made to put your wishes above everything for most of her childhood. And now you're expecting her to keep doing that. You want her to put your wishes (for a close relationship, for her to be your friend and only confidante) above her needs (for space, freedom to grow and just her mental health to be protected).\n\nYou aren't to blame for your childhoods but you are intrinsically linked to her miserable upbringing because it was all for your happiness.

You were selfish then, you are selfish now. \n\nMaybe you should stop catering to your own feelings and think about your sister's for ONCE", "YTA. I cant blame you of what your parents did while you guys were childs outside your guilttripping, wich is horrible cause you basically chained your sister. Now both are adults and she was pretty clear about not wanting anything to do with you or your parents both with going full no contact and ignoring your msgs so the question is. Why cant you respect her choices and life? Why do you think you have any power over her or know what is best?", "YTA. You seem to have absorbed your parents\u2019idea that relationships can be forced. They cannot. \nI understand you had a difficult childhood and your parents really messed up your relationship with your sister. You need to accept that for your sister, a relationship with you is not possible right now. \n\nWhen someone doesn\u2019t respond to emails or texts or letters or any form of communication that is a message for you to leave them alone. Does it hurt?  Yes. That\u2019s what you need to process in therapy.  If you don\u2019t do therapy to understand how relationships work you\u2019ll never be able to have a good relationship. \n\nAlso, while this may or may not be true in your situation, it\u2019s possible your parents may have destroyed your relationship with your sister permanently, especially if you don\u2019t respect her desire to be left alone. It sounds like she wanted a clean break from the dysfunction of your family so she could learn new ways to have relationships. You need to do similar and make friends on your own.

Whether that's \"fair\" or not is irrelevant. There can't be a relationship unless *both* people are interested, and your sister has made it crystal clear that she's not. So what you need to do is respect that and stop trying to get in touch with her. At all. By any method. And if you can't do that while you're at the same college, then you need to go somewhere else.\n\nIf your sister ever wants to rekindle your relationship, she will know - or can find out - how to reach you.

Having said that, you did mention guilt tripping and that trapped your sister, despite that not being your intention, that was still a consequence.
