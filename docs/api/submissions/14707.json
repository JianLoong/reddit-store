All you needed to do is apologize for what you asked for as a kid; let her know that you begged your parents to let her have a life and your parents declined and that's IT.

There may be hope for you to restore a relationship with her but forcing it, and invading the space she has finally been able to establish for herself, is the worst possible way to do it.

It's hard to understand why you would think going to her university and effectively forcing yourself on someone who has made it clear she wants no relationship would be a good choice. \n\nYou should transfer out immediately, and at some point in the future send her one last message that apologizes, explains you no longer go to school there and want to give her space, but that you hope she'll find it in her heart someday to talk to you about your childhoods.

You want her to put your wishes (for a close relationship, for her to be your friend and only confidante) above her needs (for space, freedom to grow and just her mental health to be protected).\n\nYou aren't to blame for your childhoods but you are intrinsically linked to her miserable upbringing because it was all for your happiness.

Does it hurt?  Yes. That\u2019s what you need to process in therapy.

But you can\u2019t just turn up in a city unexpected and hope someone\u2019s happy you live there, you could have talked to her before you applied to the college, the cutting communications was a big sign not to come.\n\nIn normal circumstances YTA, but if you can appreciate you\u2019ve made a massive mistake and pump the breaks, I think it\u2019s understandable that it wasn\u2019t malicious. \n\nIf you want a relationship with your sister you have to make the balance. Message her \u2018hey, I realise I\u2019ve made a big mistake coming here but I\u2019d like to keep a relationship with you, I\u2019m not going to bother you or chase you but if you could see me should you get the time, then please do. It would mean the world to me.\u201d Or similar in your own words. And then don\u2019t chase it up, leave her alone.", "YTA.

Now she\u2019s happy, so I\u2019m forcing myself back into her life.\u201d Was the surgery you had a lobotomy? WTF??? YTA. Leave her alone.", "YTA. You admitted you forced your parents to deny your sister a childhood because you couldn't have a normal one. You didn't end up at her university by accident. You stalked her and intentionally followed her to expressly refuse her very clear wishes to not associate with you.", "Oh no, this is very sad. YTA, but I believe you when you say that\u2019s not what you intended. Whether or not it was your fault, her whole life was made to be about *you, you, you, you.* \n\nWhen people go no contact for purposes of working on their trauma in peace, it doesn\u2019t mean you try to contact them harder. Visiting her at her university to try and see if she would see you is one thing- but actually going to the same school was probably not the right choice. You\u2019re pushing her away even more, which was the opposite of what you were trying to accomplish. Talk about breeding more resentment. From your story, my best guess is that she would probably come back around sometime, but after a few years of growing and gaining experience and perspective, and maybe some therapy. Rushing this really throws a wrench in her healing process. She was trying to reestablish her identity and her life as an individual who isn\u2019t defined by caring for or being limited by anyone else, and you said \u201cnah fuck that I want a relationship *now*\u201d\n\nThis is hard on all of you. I\u2019m sorry you miss your sister, and I know you must feel guilt for how things worked out when you were maybe too young to know better. But unfortunately, you made your bed here and it\u2019s not your place to decide not to lay in it if you get what I mean. \n\nI don\u2019t know what you do at this point, except apologize if she\u2019s interested in hearing it, and leaving her alone.", "You keep saying she\u2019s the only one you feel close too but you guys haven\u2019t had a relationship in years. The relationship is one sided. Even if it\u2019s your parents fault, you have no say in how she feel and decisions she makes. Respect her. Let her have her own life and you make yours too. Just like it\u2019s difficult for you, it was difficult for her. Stop being selfish. \n\nYTA", "YTA. you stalked her after she cut off contact and went to her university. that is not ok.", "YTA, but the bigger point is that you need to get a life dude. You are overly dependent on your sister and have failed to make a person of yourself, even after she cut you off. Make some friends, in the future maybe make huge decisions about your future (like what university you want to go to) based on what\u2019s best for you and get some therapy.", "YTA. And from your comments, you need therapy. Leave her alone.", "YTA\n\nThe meaning of no contact is to limit or cut off all communications with some someone (or some people) such as your family. You were a kid then, you didn't know that your actions might've hurt her. However she has a new life and doesn't want to see you. Accept it. The fact that you even applied to the university just because of her even though you clearly read between the lines and figured out that she wants to go no contact but still disregarded this, that's being a kid again. It's ok to want to reconnect, it is not ok to go pry into someone's life and confront them, forgetting their wishes of wanting nothing to do with you and your family and then expect her to want to be close to you again. \n\nI'm sorry your relationship with your sister has gone down to this level, but you must realize that you should wait for her, instead of invading her life to be close again.", "YTA. How could you do that?", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, as the person who caused harm to your sister alongside your parents, you do not get to extend the hand of reconciliation. That is your sister who gets to do that as the person who was wronged in this situation. You do not get to tell her that enough time has passed, that you should bury the hatchet, that you want a relationship - however you want to phrase it, that is not your privilege. It is her right decide ***if*** *and* ***therefore*** *when* to try and reconnect and right now any possibility of that ever happening in the future has been damaged by what you have just done.\n\nYou clearly have no care regarding your sister's well-being or mental health as far as it pertains to her as a person, only how it affects you directly. You told your parents to make her give up her own activities so she could be around you. You pushed your parents to let her have her own life because it impacted your relationship. And then you applied to her university after seeing that she was happy there - she was happy because she was away from the family that neglected and guilt-tripped her for almost her entire childhood but that doesn't matter because now *you* want to rekindle a relationship that has not existed in 13 years. Then you proceed to harass her through her school e-mail and again in-person because  who cares how you reaching out may be negatively affecting as long as you get what you want. Now those things which she needs to help her succeed in school and maintain her social life have been ruined by you as well - once again, she is that 7 year old girl who is not able to have her own existence outside of her sister and her wishes.\n\nYes, OP, to say it once again: You are the asshole.", "You\u2019re stalking her. Stop. \n\nYTA, obviously.", "YTA .... you don't TELL someone your meeting fir coffee you ask!! But YTA for stalking her!!", "YTA. \n\nTake a hint. \n\nYour sister went no contact for a reason, and since its been quite a while, I'd have used my common sense and left her alone. She made it incredibly, crystal clear to you that she didn't want anything to do with you. \n\nLet your sister have her own life. If she wants you in it, she'll let you know - Respect her silence if she doesn't.", "YTA. Take the hint she wants nothing to do with you or your parents. You need to respect that. You and especially your parents destroyed any hope of a relationship with her. Drop out and go to school somewhere else.", "YTA. You can\u2019t make people love you, even if you had a relationship. I understand the desire to be close with her but I think that picking that same university because she goes there is creepy. At this point I would accept that if she comes around and tries to re-form a relationship, it\u2019ll be on her terms. Maybe email her or something and say that you are sorry for disrespecting her desire for some space, and tell her you will keep your distance, and if she wants to talk, then the door is open. After that, leave her alone.", "YTA op why did you have to apply? Why couldn't you contact her a normal way and respect her boundaries regardless of if its the outcome you want.

Apply to a different college and leave her alone!", "YTA, if you want to salvage any chance of a relationship make immediate plans to transfer. Then apologize for trying to force a relationship, apologize for harassing her, apologize for being resentful and mean as a kid and let her know you are transferring. You invaded her safe place where she had a chance of normality and shattered that. You've given her no indication you're any different from the kid you were and every indication you'll abuse her for your own wants.

Your sister has always had her choices taken away from her by you and your parents and you just did it again.\n\nBy going away to college and cutting you all off she finally had some agency again where she had her own life and then you come following her because you want your childhood relationship(or something akin to it) back and when she continued to ignore your attempts at contact you again take the choice out of her hands by barging into her life when you are not welcome.\n\nThe best thing you can do at this point is to write her an email and tell her you are sorry and that you want a relationship but you understand that you've damaged it badly so if she decides she wants to ever renew anything it will be on her terms and you're ready for whatever she wants and promise you'll transfer out of her university.\n\nMaybe someday she'll let you back in to her life but maybe not.", "Info: what makes you believe you have the right to force your presence on someone who doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you? Like what exactly makes your wants more important than hers?\n\nI ask this because you and your family ruined her childhood and now that she\u2019s making decisions that make her happy, you feel that your desire to rekindle with her is more important than the decisions she has made for herself.", "Op let me start by saying I'm glad you are much healthier now. The way you behaved as a child probably wasn't best for your sister but you were a child who was sick and scared and you tried to rectify it as soon as you got a little older, so NTA for the childhood stuff.\n\nAs for the adult stuff sorry but I gotta give say YTA. I want you to understand that I empathize with you and wanting a relationship with your sister, but you mishandled the situation. When people go no contact with their family, it's not because it is fun or they just want you to suffer, it's because they have so much pain and resentment that they need to separate themselves inorder to be able to heal. You are taking that opportunity away from your sister. My advice would be to write her an email apologizing for not considering how this would affect her and promise her you won't interfere with her life anymore, but if she ever wants to reach out in the future, your door is always open.\n\nWith that cut off all contact and get on with your life as if you don't have a sibling.

You mean, in your mind, there is *still* room for the possibility that maybe your way *was* right??\n\nLet's be clear - there is no room. Your way was 100% wrong. Your reasons are utterly meaningless. When someone moves far from you, cuts off contact with you, changes their number, and refuses to answer your emails, the message there is \"I don't want you in my life.\"  It doesn't mean \"Please keep stalking me and show up to places I go.\"\n\n**YTA** and so are your parents.\n\nGood job completely ruining your sister's childhood, and possibly leaving her with lifelong mental health issues.\n\nJackass.", "Unpopular opinion but ESH.

I feel bad for both of them.", "Yeah, that\u2019s the thing. Op is an AH for how she\u2019s behaving now as an adult.

Give her that promise. Let her know you're available. It is her call to make and not yours.\n\nI am someone who lost a good chunk of my youth because of my dad and I find it hard to forgive him.
