None of this was your doing, it was his job to look out for you and obviously he failed so hard the dean reevaluated.", "NTA, this jerk has no business working in student housing.  The seafood allergies are more than enough to give you a better pick with accomodations.  The dean did right by you.", "NTA\n\nYou have life threatening allergies. The system didn\u2019t work for you this year and it sounds like you were just asking that your access needs be considered and acted on. You shouldn\u2019t have to move heaven and earth to be placed in a living space that is safe.\n\nThe head of Disability Services should have been more attentive. It sucks if they were fired, but it seems to me it\u2019s not a fireable offence.

How do you know he was fired?  They may have moved him to another position where he wouldn\u2019t interact with students.  If he was fired, I doubt his interaction with you was the only reason.

As a person who has been to the hospital on several occasions due to your allergy you need to be able to at least be able to sleep without worrying if your going to wake up in the hospital. The fact that this guy didn't want to help you and disregarded your health means he got himself fired.", "Second \"aita for getting some guy fired because of my allergy\" post I've seen in a couple of hours. Weird", "NTA.  His poor performance at work got him fired.  You bringing it up to the dean might have gotten him fires earlier, but better now than after he gets some\nkid killed through negligence.  You may have saved a life.  Possibly your own.", "NTA. You just did everyone else with health issues at that school a HUGE favor by continuing to advocate for yourself. Good job!", "NTA. The guy was being a major pain that needed to be removed for the good of those with serious allergies.", "NTA\n\nYour allergies are life threatening. If he lacks the basic intelligence and empathy to deal with it, he doesn't need to be working in that job.", "NTA. The man at the housing office obviously didn't take his job and students' health seriously enough. You were right to go to the dean. The fact the guy isn't at the housing office anymore shows that the dean shared your opinion.", "Exactly. NTA.", "The look on the lady at the desks face and her apologetic tone told me that they\u2019re used to him treating students like shit, so it could be likely he had a long list of complaints on him before this.", "Someone heading a university department is not going to be let go for one thing, unless he embezzled university funds and spent them on hookers and coke. It\u2019s more likely they shuffled him somewhere that he won\u2019t be dealing with students. \n\nAlthough if he was fired, I wouldn\u2019t shed too many tears. I\u2019m making an assumption you\u2019re in the US, in which case you have the RIGHT to \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d Asking to be in a room without pets and allergens that could kill you is reasonable. You are NTA.", "I\u2019m assuming because his name and picture used to be on the Office of Disabilities for my schools website and has since been removed with a new man listed and his picture. It\u2019s very possibly they moved him to another position.\nThe lady who worked in his office\u2019s demeanor told me he treats people like shit regularly.", "I had posted this twice on accident, might\u2019ve been me lol unless it was a different scenario.", "I mean not killing people is definitely part of his job description. He was so close to doing that how many times? Why do you feel guilt about him not being there to put more students in danger.", "OP, as someone who has worked in a variety of university offices you are NTA, in any way. Your university\u2019s system is terrible if it doesn\u2019t allow students with disabilities to 1) register for housing first no matter what year they are without ever being put into a general lottery, and 2) make disability accommodations first priority with emphasis on safety. You should *never* have been put in a position where your roommates made you unsafe with their cooking, at a *minimum* they should have been made aware of your needs and agreed not to use those things before they became your roommates. The *head of disability services* should *never* have been so dismissive of your safety, I\u2019m absolutely stunned re-reading your post. I\u2019m sorry you had to be the one who had to take him on, but I am not sorry that A. H. got what he deserved and is far away from students who need real help.", "It wasn't! Other one was about a peanut allergy. In any case, you are definitely NTA and the dean's assessment of the lack of compassion problem is spot on. His failure to take a life threatening situation seriously could and would probably have eventually resulted in a lawsuit against the school. That dude should not be in the position he was in. Don't waste a second of your life feeling guilty about it."]}
