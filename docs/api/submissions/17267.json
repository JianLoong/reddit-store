My husband and I lived there for 8 years. 8 months ago we moved into our second home. We were able to have both mortgages and keep the first home for a rental property.  It\u2019s a small 120yo old house, with an addition on the back from the 90s. We found a young couple and their two young children to rent the property, a multi-year lease with buy out option as they were working on a first time home buyers loan.   We planned on doing renovations before they moved in: fixing some drywall, paint, and new floors throughout. We worked out providing materials to them, her family did the labor, and we lowered rent. All incentives for them to be able to buy the property.  They moved in just before the New Year and have been model tenants. \n\nYesterday there was a large fire at the home.  My tenants were not home and it appears to have been electrical in the exterior wall of the addition. The burned areas are limited to the upper and lower levels of the addition but the original part of the home will need remediation. The house was worth around $73k before the fire. My husband and I are not confident the home will be able to have the necessary repairs preformed and the home remediated for less than it\u2019s worth.  I found out during the fire my tenants didn\u2019t have valid renters insurance.  Their lack of insurance is a violation of their lease, so I am at no obligation to fix it for them to continue the lease legally. \n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting to level it and be done? I could pay off the mortgage and level it with what I will get from insurance. The detached garage is fine and we could keep the property and use it for whatever. Garden; storage, etc and only pay the taxes - which would be minimal with only the garage.\n\nEdit: Adding a couple explanations. First about the rental insurance. The rental insurance required was for more than their personal belongings, the amount they insured their belongings for was up to them. What was more crucial is the liability amount for accidents. Say their guest hurt themselves on the property and my tenants didn\u2019t have renters liability insurance- I could be sued. Second, the wiring. The entire house was updated from knob and tube up to current code when the addition went on in \u201891. It was all inspected and approved. There was no issues with lights shorting or breakers tripping or any indication there was an electrical issue. My family lived in the home for 8 years and we made lots of updates- roof, hvac, plumbing systems. The repairs are not just cosmetic. Starting from structural supports, studs, insulation, wiring, windows, doors, drywall, paint, labor and remediation through the rest. Repairs are going to be very close if not more than the home is worth in this rural community.", "created_utc": 1684117088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13huoqj/aita_for_demolishing_my_rental_home_that_had_a/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sucks when it happens.\n\nSeparate the situations.  Even if your tenants did have renters insurance, you would not be required to repair and release the home to them.  Once a fire happens, generally the certificate of occupancy is pulled by the city it is in until the home is fully repaired and up to code.   It n most cases, this ends the lease. Period.  \n\nBe thankful no one died as a result of the fire. \n\nIt is highly likely that insurance will not pay to repair the home.  The insurance adjuster might demand it be torn down.  Because you\u2019ve had a fire, it is likely that many issues that could be overlooked in a standing home will not be overlooked, and the major systems will need to be brought up to current code.  That, plus the cost of building materials?  It will almost certainly cost more than the home is worth to repair it.\n\nIs the property close by the home you reside in?  Is there a reason to retain the property?  If not, take the insurance, pay off what you owe.  You can demo the home or not.  If you don\u2019t care to retain it, you can also sell the home, as is, to someone who wants to do the work to repair it.  It can be done, but is honestly likely to cost more than simply building from scratch.", "NTA \n\nIt's your property.

In other words, if you were doing regular maintainence and taking care of the house, then it was an act of god, as it were, and now that it has happened you have to do what makes best sense for your finances. It's unfortunate that they lost everything, but renter's insurance is on them. My parents had a fire in their house started by something completely unforeseen. It happens.

It is a 120yr old house after all. Definitely get a lawyer...", "Yes, you would be. You seem to think that them not having bought valid renters insurance negates you having a property that you didn\u2019t maintain well enough not to catch on fire. They literally lost far more than you did with smoke and water damage. Honestly, they could probably sue you as the landlord.

Have you done the regular 3-5 year electrical inspection? Your edit seems to indicate that it was up to code in 1991 and rarely, if ever, checked since then. \n\nAnd their renters liability wouldn't cover this. They were not liable. So even if they didn't have renters liability currently it wouldn't matter. This would still be on you.", "YTA \n\nThere\u2019s things you CAN do but shouldn\u2019t, and this falls into that category. Yes they didn\u2019t carry renter\u2019s insurance which was part of the lease, but there was also an expectation of the property to be of sufficient quality and repair as to not spontaneously combust and destroy all of tenant\u2019s property. \n\nYou CAN bulldoze it and leave them homeless, but you SHOULD repair it, and let them finish out the lease/rent to own agreement. \n\nShould you choose to demolish it, be prepared for a VERY costly and cumbersome lawsuit from the tenants for what amounts to an eviction. Regardless of whether they would win or not, any attorney would GLADLY take their case on contingency, while your attorney bills would probably be well past what you would \u201csave\u201d by demolishing the property. \n\nSucks all around, but remodel the house, and let them keep living there is the least horrible solution for everyone.", "How is it any of your business if they insured THEIR property? \n\nWas the fire because of something you didn't fix, or because they did shoddy improvements?", "Are you going to wish OP well when the tenant rightfully sues them for not maintaining the property in a non combustible condition and almost killing then?

If it is going to cost more than it\u2019s worth to rebuild, most people would walk away. Same as if a car is totaled.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t think OP is an AH. Might not be the best moral decision. If it is to costly then do what is best for you.", "The home was fully inspected when i purchased In 2014 and electrical did not show concerns.

Small claims usually has jurisdiction in cases under 5 or $10,000. Any competent attorney would file this in state district court for a minimum of $100,000, for possessions, loss of domicile, and distress. They can sue for any amount, and pick the venue they sue in. \n\nAlso, the reason you hardly ever hear testimony as such in court, is because cooler heads usually prevail and convince the homeowner to cut a check so it doesn\u2019t go to court. \n\nIn my state well over 95 percent of cases that survive summary judgement get settled beforehand, for very good reason. Everything goes out the window when a jury gets involved. \n\nIt will be cheaper and less aggravating in the short term, medium term, and long term to rebuild and let the tenant move back in, than to demo it and play it out in court.
