For your relationship with Mark being different? I don't really know, but I do think your feelings are misdirected and you should address that. \n\nYou owe Natalie a sincere apology and maybe you need to have an honest and open conversation with your best friend about how you feel but before you do any of this, recognize that this is THEIR WEDDING that they are excited about and already stressed out about and that they deserve to have people there who truly want to celebrate THEM (not just him) and THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER (not his best friend)", "YTA.

Try growing up instead of staying stuck in high school or your friends won\u2019t last through the wedding.", "You sound incredibly jealous of Natalie and Mark's relationship. **Natalie** is his best friend. She is trying to be accommodating to you, and you keep throwing in her face that you think you're more important to him. Of course she is going to dislike you trying to cause a rift in their relationship. It's exactly what you intended. Only you thought Mark would be on your side, and he's not -- he's with **Natalie**. Welcome to adulting.", "That's because he doesn't love you. He loves Natalie.", "As he should. What the hell is your problem. \nJealousy is not a good look.", "That's called setting healthy boundaries when you are in a relationship. Kudos for Mark for being a stand up guy.\n\nYou sound like you want to compete with his soon-to-be WIFE. That tramples whatever you and Mark have.\n\nYou sound like a delusional NLTOG. Get better.", "Find a boyfriend OP", "Yeah\u2026because she\u2019s his fianc\u00e9e. She\u2019s the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with\u2026duh, she\u2019s more of a priority than you.", "Whether you like it or not, it's inappropriate to have opposite sex 'best friends' once you're committed to somebody else. You can disagree all you want, but it sounds like your buddy here thinks so too.", "It sucks how bad you are at giving advice, I\u2019m sorry.", "You must be like 22 or something, because this just sounds ignorant. I\u2019ve been best friends with my bestie for over 20 years. If she put me ahead of her husband and kids I would be concerned. Do we still have a great/close relationship? Of course! But I\u2019m not her priority, her family is. All relationships (friendship included) change and evolve over time. Now you know.", "It does suck, it hurts. But it is also the way it was always going to be. OP should be *happy* for Mark. That should be her reaction. She should grieve for the lost parts of the friendship quietly, and be enthusiastically happy for Mark. That\u2019s real friendship."]}
