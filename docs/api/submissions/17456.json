Your behaviour was entitled, rude and immature.  You disrespected her at every turn and that would deeply insult anyone.\n\nIt would have been alright if you\u2019d asked once for an alternate outfit and upon getting told \u201cno\u201d accepted it.

Wise up: you are not the main character in their wedding. Natalie has already gone above and beyond to try to include you; either say thankyou and play ball or leave them both alone.

Nothing she's asking is out of the ordinary. And she's even working closely with you to help you find something you might like. \n\nNewsflash: nothing about this is about you. So either put on a smile, be supportive and put a more concerted effort into making it work, or sulk about it and just go as a guest. The bride has so much to plan, and you're over here making more work for her. I personally have never worn a bridesmaid gown that I really loved, but it was never about me to begin with.

The rest is almost unnecessary", "YTA you said you didn\u2019t want to say the grooms women comment at the beginning as not to upset her but then say it when you guys are arguing about the dress code? You should respectfully drop out and not be a part of the wedding. Crop top and a wide tailored pant is in my opinion not appropriate for a bridesmaid outfit so I understand her saying no. Also it would make you stand out from her other bridesmaids . you don\u2019t have to \u201clove\u201d the choice, it\u2019s about the people getting married.

That's it. No arguments or suggestions, those are your choices. \n\nYou have no right to suggest being a groomswoman or changing the entire look of the bridal party.

Mark wasn\u2019t doing groomswomen and yet, him and his fianc\u00e9 still made you a part of his wedding. \n\nPlanning a wedding is stressful as *hell* and she was so patient with you, even considered looking at your outfit, which she didn\u2019t have to do btw.

After accepting being a bridesmaid, unless Natalie was expecting something absolutely insane, you need to follow through with what she wants from her bridesmaids. So you really do know WHY you should have to wear a dress and high heels to the wedding.\n\nMark sucks because it's apparent he NEVER talked to you about this at all despite supposedly being your best friend. He never told you that he wasn't going to have a groomswoman. Nor mention that he's the one who pushed Natalie into letting you be one of her bridesmaid.\n\nNatalie, was only trying to involve you at the request of Mark. She was way more patient than most brides-to-be would be in her situation. So you most certainly owe an apology to Natalie.", "ESH or NAH.

They some how agreed on no grooms woman, but through insistence and being the good friend mark is he convinced bride to let you be a bridesmaid. through being pushy and getting her upset now it turns on you making you look ungrateful for something that was extended to you as a way of making both people happy.", "Totally NTA. \n\nIn fact, my ex best friend was supposed to be a groomswoman in our recent wedding and because we knew she hated dresses, we got her a nice suit. We just wanted everyone to feel good in their appearance.\n\nThey are trying to include you but are being the assholes for trying to force gender norms on you - I guess for appearances, despite knowing your feelings. \n\nI'm not sure why they would want anyone feeling uncomfortable and self conscious about their wedding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You hating wearing dresses is irrelevant here because the societal standard for bridesmaids is, most often, dresses and heels and this is something you reasonably would have known prior to accepting your bridesmaid role. \n\nWhat you are truly upset about seems to have nothing to do with the dress and everything to do with the fact that Mark did not choose you to be a groomswoman despite being your best friend.

For your relationship with Mark being different? I don't really know, but I do think your feelings are misdirected and you should address that. \n\nYou owe Natalie a sincere apology and maybe you need to have an honest and open conversation with your best friend about how you feel but before you do any of this, recognize that this is THEIR WEDDING that they are excited about and already stressed out about and that they deserve to have people there who truly want to celebrate THEM (not just him) and THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER (not his best friend)", "YTA.

Yes, you can make suggestions, but the only people who have an actual say in the wedding is the bride, groom, and the parents (if they are footing the bill). The rest of the wedding party, like groomsmen/women and bridesmaids, can make suggestions, but their \"say\" is extremely minimal at best.", "Are you still a bridesmaid?", "Is throwing a fit over their wants for their wedding worth losing your friendship with mark? Because he will take his soon to be wife\u2019s side. This is the most important day of his life so far we\u2019re talking about and you\u2019re causing issues, he won\u2019t just forget that.", "Errr.. NOPE. You get to voice your opinion but you don't get final say. Do you seriously think the women out there in the world's most hideous dresses as bride's maids didn't have better taste? You get to choose the style of dress that's the say you get. If you don't like it, step down from being a bride's maid.", "No, you shouldn\u2019t lol", "Yeah\u2026 that\u2019s not how that works. YTA", "Absolutely not. It's THEIR day. THEIRS. They get all the say unless it's extreme - and this is NOT extreme. It's actually very, very lenient. You do not get a say, at all. If you can't suck it up then don't be a bridesmaid. It'd be different if she was trying to force you to cut/dye your hair, lose/gain weight, or something like that. But her only demand is that it's a lilac dress and you wear heels?! That's the bare minimum. YTA and a massive one for trying to make their day about you.", "You really aren't picking up on the tone of these comments are you? You are right, the bride and groom and everyone on AITA are wrong? Really?", "Feel free to explain this one.", "Yeah you were counting more on browbeating her or either Mark into allowing you to get your way so you were probably distracted and less interested to actually put extra efforts into finding the dress that was needed. Her insecurity has nothing to do with this, if you had been honest up front, all this wouldn't have transpired in the first place. \n\nYour problem so should be with Mark because he's not willing to accommodate groomswoman at all. Maybe he's the one insecure and insistent on specifics like these. Go argue with him.\n\nYTA for wasting everyone's time and causing unnecessary drama.", "Wow that\u2019s ridiculous of you to say or imply. You seriously are blaming her for being \u201cjealous\u201d of you and trying to \u201cundermine\u201d your relationship with HER fianc\u00e9?! Seriously you for real went there?!\n\nAfter she went out of her way to not only allow you to be apart of the wedding, she also has spent ALL of this time with you and trying to HELP YOU. Even though she\u2019s trying to plan a wedding and you\u2019re the only bridesmaid who\u2019s had trouble picking out a dress ALL THIS TIME, a bridesmaid who she probably doesn\u2019t even care is in the wedding party or not but because she loves her husband she is giving you all of this grace and patience and trying to help you in every way she can, and here you are calling her insecure and jealous and trying to \u201cundermine\u201d your relationship. \n\nMy goodness seriously??? It\u2019s HER wedding day, she compromised for both you and her husband\u2019s sake to allow you to be a bridesmaid and has done everything to keep YOU happy and you\u2019re here worried about how YOU will look on HER wedding day. I mean I just can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m reading here. \n\n\nI kind of hope your best friend and his fianc\u00e9 find this post and see how you\u2019re trying to imply that she\u2019s jealous of you, they really should know that you think this way about them and their relationship. \n\nAlso best friends are very important in life, but when you get engaged and married you\u2019re probably going to side with your SO rather than your best friend especially in a situation like this where you\u2019re being absolutely unreasonable. \n\nYou\u2019d better get used to the fact that you\u2019re not going to be the number 1 woman in his life anymore, and that there WILL be times that his wife comes first before you. But I suppose you will blame the wife for being oh so jealous and insecure about you and HER fianc\u00e9. SMH. I just lost so much respect for this situation after reading this comment.", "She's going to be his wife. OFCOURSE she is going to be more important to Mark.", "You\u2019re so difficult my god grow up", "This sounds extremely loaded and may warrant an edit / additional info to your post", "Perhaps yes. \n\nYou know her better than anyone else here does - do you think she is insecure about herself or has she been not great to you before? Do you think she would be enjoying this?", "We're trying. South Africa doesn't have the best range if you're looking outside of navy blue, black or heavily patterned. \n\nAlso she understandably wants sleeves - we all have our problem areas so I want her to be comfortable.\n\nWe've finally got a few options.", ">Idc what he wants. I know that I was asked on a role I wasn't interested in from the beginning but only accepted to be in the wedding party and since I couldn't be in marks I compromised with hers. Idk why mark didn't want me. Maybe she didn't let him\n\nBecause she was butthurt", "OP would be lucky to still be invited to this wedding if I was Natalie", "Idk probably yes they haven't said otherwise", "Idc what he wants. I know that I was asked on a role I wasn't interested in from the beginning but only accepted to be in the wedding party and since I couldn't be in marks I compromised with hers. Idk why mark didn't want me. Maybe she didn't let him.", "She's been friendly with me but whenever I remind her of my friendship and how close I am with Mark she becomes really cold. She's 50/50 with me. I wouldn't even talk to her if it wasn't for Mark.", "You seem to have quite the soft corner for mark and quite intent on selling to the audience here that she's more faulty all the while. Were you and mark ever more than friends at any point of time? Were you in a relationship with him?\n\nI ask because this might be clouding your judgement and maybe even imputing your personal standards onto her and putting mark on a pedestal. Nevertheless, as clear from this thread, communication is a huge issue both to you and Mark and maybe he's simply not willing to let women get into his *manly* grooms side of the wedding. And he's not man enough to convey this to you, pretty common in most weddings.", ">Idc what he wants...a role I wasn't interested in...since I couldn't be in marks I compromised\n\nYou don't care what he wants...So it's all about what you want. Mark didn't want you for OBVIOUS reasons.   \n\n\nIf you believe Mark to be an intelligent person, then why are you fighting his decision to take distance from you? He must have a great reason for that...think about it.", "If you have to remind her repeatedly of your friendship with her fianc\u00e9, that makes you incredibly insecure and jealous. That\u2019s got to be exhausting for the bride to deal with.", "Explain \u201cwhenever I remind her of my friendship and  how close I am with Mark\u201d because that could mean different things. \n\nWhen do you \u201cremind\u201d her. What convos are you having that you need to \u201cremind\u201d her how close you are? How often do you \u201cremind\u201d her of this closeness? I really hope you answer this question because I feel like it\u2019s really important.", "[deleted]", "No. Mark and I were always just best friend's. I treat him the same way I treat my brother.", "I know. She doesn't like the truth and always tries to act above and beyond me in mark's life. I thought we'd connect over the wedding but seems like I was the villain in her story once again.", "Will you be this difficult with your brothers wife when he gets married?", "Well\u2026.that\u2019s because she is above you in marks life, she\u2019s going to be his wife. Wife comes before friend. She\u2019s the most important person in his life now.", "He's marrying her she is above you in his life", "In my experience with people like Natalie, they are insecure. That is not an excuse but it would explain a lot - she feels threatened by you in some way. \n\nOnce again? What has happened before?", "Why pick? By this logic I knew him since we were 13 and Natalie came in his life when we were 19.", "From the beginning of their relationship mark has stopped spending as much time with me and even stopped doing things that were considered \"our things\" because he didn't wanna make Natalie uncomfortable. At this point our friendship is very basic and nothing special all because the only thing he cares about is Natalie's comfort and insecurity.", "Because he doesn\u2019t love you, he loves Natalie. He wants to spend his life with Natalie, he wants to grow old with Natalie, he wants to spend every day with Natalie. He doesn\u2019t want that with you. You two are not on the same level and you never will be. She\u2019s not just some friend, she\u2019s not just some passing phase, she\u2019s his life partner. Time of knowing him doesn\u2019t matter, he still will always pick her over you. You need to accept that, and if you can\u2019t it\u2019ll be easier for you to remove yourself from marks life if that\u2019s going to be hard for you.", "Because she is his spouse. His other half. His partner. His chosen family. You are just a friend.", "That isn\u2019t that long tbh, some friendships have lasted 20 years by your age.", "Define \u201cstopped doing things that were considered \u2018our things\u2019\u201d \n\n I really would like to know what those specific things are. \n\nAlso what do you consider spending less time as? Like were you all just always around each other every single day, then well yea\u2026 he found a relationship of course he\u2019s going to spend less time with his friends! It doesn\u2019t matter what gender the friend is! \n\nYou also act like this is some new relationship in a way. But in reality they\u2019ve known each other for at least 5-6 years. Did you all ever date? And if not be completely honest with me, did/do you want to be in a relationship with him? \n\nThis is so extremely important to this entire situation and I haven\u2019t seen you answer one time about if you were ever romantically involved at some point, nor have you answered any questions on what you\u2019re actual feelings for him are in the first place. This comes off as someone who wants to be more than \u201cbest friends\u201d.", "It sucks your friendship has changed because of a relationship, I am sorry.", "So he can't love his friends? He can only love Natalie? And I'm not a passing phase either I've known him for 12 years.", "Thank you. Most people here attack me but it seems like nobody values friendships as much as romantic partners anymore and they've normalised it and blame me for needing more time and attention from my friend."]}
