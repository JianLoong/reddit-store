She extended an olive branch, you spat in her face because you think it's all about you. Good going.", "YTA. The couple wanted you as part of their day, clearly agreeing not to do groomswomem (and presumably bridesmen).

You should be able to wear a dress for a few hours for your best friend's wedding. Also very rude to basically tell her you're not her friend, when she asked you to play a role in her wedding.

If Mark is truly your best friend, you'll work on building a great relationship with the person he's choosing to love and marry.

If you didn't want to be a bridesmaid, you shouldn't have agreed to be a bridesmaid. Since you accepted, you do have a responsibility to make an effort when it comes to the outfit.

They don\u2019t want other single people to feel like a third wheel or the odd man out, so they just leave them out entirely sometimes. The way to prevent that from happening is to develop independent friendships with both people.

In OP's situation, though, where she's not close to the bride, she should have checked with the bride when first asked whether the bride would let her wear something other than a dress/skirt and then turned down being a bridesmaid if she really is that uncomfortable with wearing dresses. OP is also TA for other reasons. In a situation where the bride has a close friend or family member whom they KNOW is really, deeply uncomfortable wearing dresses, I think there are situations where it can be an AH move to try to make them wear one.

For all we know, this could be a masc of center presenting lesbian, I don't know. None of us do.\n\nI'm a masculine of center presenting lesbian, meaning I haven't worn a dress since 2006 (in a friend's wedding, no less). I've been in three weddings since then and had my own. I didn't wear a dress in any one of those weddings and I was a bridesmaid, a groomswoman and a best woman. My wife and I had a mixed gender wedding party and gave our wedding party a masculine and feminine option for attire and let them pick. Some of the women picked the masculine option. When I was a groomswoman, I was closer to the bride than I was the groom, but they let me dress as myself and put me on the groom's side. When I was the best woman, my best friend was the groom. I didn't want to fuck any of those people because they were just my friends and they allowed me to present as me in their weddings because they love me and want me to be myself. For people who say \"it's only a few hours of discomfort,\" for some of us that isn't he case. For me, putting on a dress and makeup that doesn't really suit me gives me as close to gender dysphoria as I am going to get. It's more than just discomfort for some of us and to be dismissive of those experiences is a bit ignorant. For some of us it goes deeper than that.\n\nObviously, it's up to the two people getting married how they want to do things and I do think OP should have asked if she would be required to wear a dress prior to accepting and if those were the conditions, than she should have politely declined. The commitment shouldn't have been accepted without the full understanding of what the commitment was, so on that OP failed, but I also think if the husband is her best friend, then it's on him to stand up for her and treat her as such. Weddings are about the couple, sure, but they're also about everyone else that's there to some degree. When my wife and I chose our wedding party and attire, it was important to us that our wedding party got to feel like themselves in that moment. I also didn't want photos from my wedding day of my friends being uncomfortable or to look at photos and not see the people I know and love in them because I forced them to wear something they normally wouldn't. I wanted photos with my friends, not some perfect image where I force my friends to conform to have some traditional ideal. \n\nOnce again, people are allowed to make the choices they want to make for their wedding and people are allowed to decline if they don't like the stipulations, but from my personal perspective I sometimes think people planning their weddings shouldn't treat their wedding party as though they're the bride and groom on the top of the cake, but that's just me.", "I was responding that I did not get the vibes she like the groom either. She genuinely seemed more comfortable with the guys. Unfortunately she is approaching it terribly. It\u2019s not an either or.

I think the bride was very accommodating and tried to help make OP more comfortable which is a lot more than most brides do.", "I\u2019m straight cis female who hates really anything feminine. It makes my skin crawl. My style is androgynous basically always. No dresses, no skirts, no heels, no makeup, no jewelry usually. Undercut hairstyle. \n\nA tube top would make me hide in my room. I\u2019m 35. \n\nI\u2019ve uncomfortably worn dresses to weddings because I had to.  Either suck it up for a few hours or don\u2019t be a bridesmaid, OP. Go as a guest and wear a suit. Or don\u2019t go at all. YTA.", "Wouldn't be surprised if that was the case. I, and it seems many others, get the sense that there's a lot of info left out from OP.", "Yeah it bothers me more than it should that she used the word \"gracefully\" instead of \"graciously\", though I'd like it even better if neither were used.", "I wore an orange dress that was like a floor length high- vis jacket. The bride paired it with silver sandals so high the bridesmaids walked down the aisle like baby giraffes. The straps on the sandals were so thin all five bridesmaids feet were bleeding before the dinner was over. Oh and the false tans were so bad we looked like oompa loompas from Charlie and the chocolate factory. We just had to suck it up and smile.", "Christmas wedding with red velvet dresses with fur trim. And I had to carry a fucking muff instead of flowers. Not to mention the fur headband.", "I worked with a woman who bought something very similar to that, but in a dark purple and with some beading, as a mother of the bride outfit. She wasn\u2019t a big fan of dresses, and it looked stunning on her. Also, she loved to dance so just felt more comfortable in it for the reception. Her daughter (the bride) was in full support of her wearing it, and it looked great.", "I was a bridesmaid recently, and someone wore a jumpsuit very similar to that. From the same company even. They were stunning.", "That is so pretty! Plus it\u2019s easy to make it look like a dress in pictures with the wide legs. I\u2019ve definately saved this for when I\u2019ll need an elegant outfit", "OMG!!!  That is SO CUTE!!!!  I am not necessarily into dresses either (except for certain occasions) and I needed lilac/purple for my sisters wedding some years ago, and I would have TOTALLY rocked that if they sold it in my size.\n\nRealistically I was worried about wearing purple to my sisters wedding as I am overweight, and I didn't want to end up looking like a grape.  I didn't of course, and I found a cute dress, and killer shoes, but it was a legit worry.", "Azazie is great! That's where my SIL had us get our bridesmaid dresses. There's a feature where the bride can choose a length and color, and then you can shop all the dresses available in that length and color and choose your own style.", "I've never gotten the hatred for dresses, they're the single most comfortable and practical piece of clothing there is if the fit is the right one.", "Oh 100%. If I lived the *full* masc lifestyle 24/7 I would probably have objected and bought a pink suit, which is a perfectly reasonable and acceptable thing for people with different gender expressions to do!", "\"I'm sorry, we don't have your sheep.\"", "Was her name Lola? \ud83d\ude1d", "Nah, she just wanted a chance to dress up like princess Bubbleyum", "I was thinking it sounds like the southern belle dress from \u201827 Dresses\u2019.", "Haha.

Seeing as they were against a groomswoman, I doubt they wanted anything non traditional. And either way the proposed outfit doesn't seem to really fit the bride and grooms color scheme so OP would stand out like a sore thumb. Seeing as OP specified the tube top was lilac I'm assuming the rest of the suit wasn't. She was trying to force her way into the groomswoman position even tho both bride and groom were opposed from the outset. And who knows. Maybe if OP had a suggested a full classy lilac suit that blended well with the dresses the bride might have been cool with it. She didn't immediately oppose the idea of a suit and tbh it sounded she just didn't like the suit OP chose.", "Flesh colored tights are the best. I love the ones that are commonly used for Ballet. They are so thick and last me ages unless I get caught on something sharp in my clumsiness lol. Thick tights, leggings, longer bike shorts and Capri leggings are all great.

She let us pick our own dresses as long as they were a shade of pale purple. \n\nI HATE dresses. H-A-T-E. Last time I wore one was my sister's wedding 8 years ago. The time before that was senior prom (only because my mother flat out forbade me to rent a tux and since I was underage I couldn't rent it on my own). I've worn skirts a few times, mainly when I needed something business casual and all my slacks were dirty or torn. I am NOT a dress person. To the point my sister specifically said if I wore a dress as he bridesmaid she'd consider that her gift because THAT is how much I hate dresses. \n\nI am pale, with cool undertones, and dark hair. Pale purple is NOT my color. \n\nI also have hypermobile ankles and fallen arches. Stilettos are ankle killers for me. \n\nAlso my skin is sensitive and I blister so easy I don't even wear sandals without full on trail socks. \n\nI wore my fee bloody on those stupid shoes in the stupid dress I donated to charity as soon as I got home with a smile on my face, and my sister will never know how much I felt like my skin was crawling (I really hate wearing dresses) or how bad my feet hurt that day because the day wasn't about me.", "Sounds like my friend who fell in love with the color of the dresses she had us wear. They were teal and strapless taffeta with a low back so you couldn't wear most bras and the boningin the dresses were plastic.

We spent the whole day drenched in sweat, pulling the dresses up because by the reception. The boning was done. \n\nComplained to the other bridesmaids about it the day of.

Is that really what you are saying?", "I agree OP is TA in this situation and I rolled my eyes hard lol, but to be fair when I was younger I absolutely hated any and all dresses, yes. I was terribly self conscious and super uncomfortable in a dress.\n\nI\u2019ve since grown out of that and will wear a dress on occasion, but will still choose a dressy jumpsuit or something more often than not because I have to wear thin biker shorts underneath dresses anyway, otherwise the rash from my bare thighs rubbing together gets painful and uncomfortable, lol.
