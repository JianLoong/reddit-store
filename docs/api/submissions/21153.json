My stepbrothers are 21 and 20.\n\nFor context, I lived with my mom and my sister before my stepdad and his two sons arrived. We moved in with them back when I was still 13, and my sister was 10. It was awkward living with strangers and call them siblings, but I could safely say we felt more like real siblings as the years passed.\n\nMy younger stepbrother (\"BJ\") and I had always used android, but we switched to apple. BJ made his old phone a second phone that he and my older stepbrother (\"AJ\") would use.\n\nRecently, my stepdad took that phone from them. M mom looked through it, and although it went thru a factory reset, the android's cloud had some leftovers. Inside this cloud there were videos from OF, thirst-trapa, and on top of it all- my sister's pictures AND videos.\n\nThey were explicit, but there were ones that were simple selfies, which made it feel worse. These were in the recently deleted, but were media that had an error deleting (for god knows why, thank you, shitty android brand!). The stuff ranged from different months of the last year. My mom and I theorized what could have happened, and we had concluded it could only be from anyone who used the phone. My sister remembered that she used it once in NOV 2021, for about two days when her old phone broke. My sister (who was 15, byw) only used facebook messenger to talk to her now-ex, who she had sent a bunch of stuff to, including explicit stuff. She deleted the app, but forgot to log out. AJ took the android from her once she got a new phone and said he would do a factory reset. I guess he didn't, and when he logged into the app, he got on her account.\n\nMoving on- The same night we found all this, we confronted my stepbrothers. I learn a day later that my parents did one-on-ones with the boys and AJ admitted to being the one who saved them. He was saving my sister's media (both explicit and not) for AN ENTIRE YEAR. \n\nThis is where the problem arises. AJ was scolded, yes, but not punished. In fact, he was probably punished more for his low grades in school rather than him using my sister's photos. We found this out over a month ago. My parents are acting like it never even happened under the guise of not knowing what to do with him. My sister and I haven't spoken to both my stepbrothers since.\n\nMy mom has argued with me countless of times to the point where I have broken down crying from her gaslighting and guilt-tripping because my sister and I should be forgiving and forgetting since he's \"changing.\"\n\nI don't know if it's my mom's words that are getting to me or something, I just need to know if I'm right for standing by her or if my mother is right and I'm being an unforgiving asshole.\n\ntl;dr - my older stepbrother saved inappropriate media of my sister & we dont ever want to speak to him again, but my parents insist we should make up and keep the peace.", "created_utc": 1688306220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ooyjp/aita_for_siding_with_my_sister_after_my/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents need to report him for having/obtaining child p**n. He is a predator and has been allowed continued access to your underage sister even after being discovered. This is not a silly thing. This is a major invasion of privacy and I can't imagine what your sister is going through realizing her \"siblings\" were using her media this way and sexualizing her under the same roof. I hope she gets therapy. If you can, get out of that house. If you're out get her out too.", "NTA  \n\n\n\"Mom, your stepson saved and masturbated to sexually explicit imagery of your at the time sixteen-year-old daughter.  He is an adult, she is not, and this is a serious crime.  Now you have a choice here, you can protect your husband's son, or you can protect your daughter.  Either way you will have to live with the consequences.\"", "NTA, this is serious and your parents are disgusting by not dealing with it. ~~Both children~~ should start by seeing a therapist. \n\n*Just read he was an adult the whole time. Parents probably know that having explicit child content on his phone could be criminal.", "NTA! Ffs the rage I felt reading this! Your mother and stepdad are completely out of line and not being nearly strict enough with your stepbrother.  He's going to remember that he got away with it,  and how the adults enabled him. Eew. I'm glad you and your sister have each other's backs.", "1000% NTA. You and your sister need to feel safe.", "NTA. Your parents are trying to keep him from ending up in prison or on a registry but he cannot be allowed to stay. He\u2019s a threat to her safety", "I mean it's a pretty clear cut NTA tbh", "NTA it is so disgusting what he did and she is a minor. Honestly, in my opinion he should have been reported to the police.", "I know this is the least important part of the story but Im wondering why the younger brother is also now on your shitlist?\n\nAnyways the whole situation is creepy and if your parents really want you to make up than actual actions, remorse and understanding from the creep brother are needed. maybe some therapy too, so he can examine his own thinking which not only lead to him doing it but also carrying this on for a year.\n\nTo add another irrelevant bit, imho android phones are the best.", "NTA. This is one of those situations that feels very close to \u201cboys will be boys\u201d because often young boys are not corrected appropriately about their inappropriate behaviour when they\u2019re younger, which leads to them thinking that their actions will have either no consequences or few consequences. Good for you for standing up for your sister, and I\u2019m sorry that your parents aren\u2019t being more responsible parents.", "NTA there are 3 in the situation but I can tell you that you and your sister are not in that group.\n\nWhat a disgusting thing for him to.  How dare he, he should of just factory reset before anything with the phone.\n\nYour mum and stepdad are doing everything wrong with this and are basically encouraging him to think he can just do it again.\n\nTo expect your poor sister to forgive him is so enraging.  She must feel so disgusted, fearful and not safe in her own home.", "NTA. This behavior is extremely predatory. You should contact your local police. Saving photos or explicit material of kids is never ok. When she was 15, he was 18. He's an adult, and this behavior is illegal. Your parents may brush this off, but the police won't.", "NTA, he's a creep, but please talk to your sister about those pictures, she was 15 and taking explicit photos and videos of yourself while underaged is illegal in most places, it's also just a bad idea", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good on you for standing up for your sister, you are 100% NTA and it's appalling that it is being pushed under the rug!", "This is why we have to protect our kids bc some parents won\u2019t punish their own. No offense but all the offense- she shouldn\u2019t have birthed kids. Or raised any. She\u2019s not qualified. Step dad and her have no business raising ANY CHILDREN and Would likely stand on his side even if he touched a kid. There\u2019s nothing you can do but get away from the toxicity.\n\nParents like this won\u2019t admit faults in certain children bc its a reflection on them.

Absolutely mental behaviour.", "NTA. I would start protecting you and your sister. I think they would\u2019ve eventually sexually assault your sister after some time. They might still even try it tbh. I would buy room door stoppers and lock your room doors every time you leave. Or even have a camera in your room. Don\u2019t let your parents think this is okay when it absolutely isn\u2019t. They can try to gaslight you all they want.", "It's difficult with our culture and our situation right now, and no matter how many times i've explained it to my mother, she blames my sister and I for ruining the peace in the house.

My sister and I are still not sure about a police report, though I know it's criminal.", "it's a whole other story, really, and also just enabling his brother- though i think its their dynamic. also, they both share the same room, same with how my sister and i share a room. still, i feel uncomfortable around him, can't help it (':", "we did talk to her about this, it was the first thing that happened after my parents found the pictures- they scolded her. would also like to say that my sister was forced and groomed to take the pictures/videos, and that it is also illegal for my adult stepbrother to have said media. my sister and i are trying to do what we can ^^;", "Absolutely not the issue here. She\u2019s not safe with a potential child predator in the house", "I hope you both stay safe.

Was there an actual reason given?", "Child is the victim here, because they are a child. Don't let them gaslight her into thinking she deserved this because she made a mistake I truly believe most modern teens make.\n\nThis is an extremely awful situation, and I hope you are able to support your sibling best you can.", "Tbh if he tries it again- teach her to fight back scream loud asf claw at him throw shit at him everything. Anything he says to her to keep her quiet is a lie. Including hurting her or other people. He\u2019s a coward. He would never. If they won\u2019t listen and things DO get worse. Fight. Back. Leave no question that he\u2019s a disgusting predator. All over him. Don\u2019t hold back. We want his friends extended family and job to see it if it happens.\n\nThe fact she even had to go to this length is beyond fucking disgusting. BEYOND there\u2019s no words in any language to describe how fucked up this is. But either way- teach her to fight. Predators are still out here for us adult women even. We have to fight sadly. And fight hard.\n\nHave her avoid him at all costs. Keep being around him to a minimum completely and be fully clothed. If your parents won\u2019t protect her- she has every right in her power to protect herself. Every fucking right as anyone else does. Even tho she shouldn\u2019t have to.

Good on you for not shaming her", "Depending on where you live OP's sister could face charges for taking those photos and sending them, so yes what I said needs to be said, everyone has already pointed what you said out to OP, I haven't seen anyone mention this and it clearly needs to be said", "It\u2019s already been said because it\u2019s the topic of the discussion We\u2019re focusing blame on the predator, not the victim", "Who said I\u2019m blaming her? This isn\u2019t me saying \u201cOPs sister deserves it for taking photos\u201d this is me saying it\u2019s important OP educates her sister on this and makes sure all photos and messages are deleted to prevent her sister suffering more"]}
