During the pandemic and forced online school, the group suffered membership losses, and it only recovered because a few students worked hard to recruit lots of people.\nOf these people who helped save the organization was \u201cJames\u201d (21M), who was on the leadership board until very recently.\n\nWhat happened though was a few people who were recruited were gay or lesbian, and then they brought all their friends who are all gay or lesbian. So now the group is mostly gay, and we can no longer mix with other social organizations. This is because male organizations want to mix with straight women, and female organizations want to mix with straight men, and our coed group is full of gay people, so no one is interested in mixing with us. So all our straight people are quitting, we aren\u2019t invited to any parties, and the whole group reputation is going down the drain.\n\nThe gay members of the group are not okay with straight people. They are convinced basically all straight people are secretly gay and everything is on a sexual spectrum, and there\u2019s no truly  straight people. And they constantly hint that our straight members (like myself for example) are actually closeted gays, because otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be in a gay group. So more straight members get uncomfortable being pressured to come out as gay and leave.\n\nJames was the only reason our organization survived the pandemic. He recruited some of the original gay people who are now pushing all the straight people out. They\u2019ve been gossiping about him for a long time, and telling everyone he\u2019s a closeted gay. He\u2019s straight and has a girlfriend, and they tell everyone she\u2019s his \u201cbeard,\u201d which causes issues in their relationship because everyone gossips about them now. The gays all invited him out to a gay bar, and he agreed since he was on leadership and wanted to be inclusive. Then they were like \u201caha! You came with us willingly to a gay bar, which proves you\u2019re gay!\u201d And when he denied it, they said \u201cYou\u2019re in denial, but we know what you are. We\u2019ll get you eventually.\u201d\n\nI was with him when we met some random students in a different setting, and they asked if he had a boyfriend. He said no, he has a girlfriend and is straight. They said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to lie\u201d and they \u201cknow he\u2019s gay because the gays in your group tell everyone you are, so you can come out to us.\u201d\n\nThis was the last straw that made him quit the leadership board and the whole group. The gays of the group bullied him out when he\u2019s the reason the group exists, and I told them so. They said I\u2019m homophobic and I just can\u2019t see that he\u2019s \u201cclearly gay\u201d because I\u2019m straight.

Why would James recruit gay people for a social club aimed at straight dating?? I think I need more clarity on what -exactly- this social group was for.  What is it arranged around? Some kind of interest? Like anime or music or sports or whatever? Because if it's anything other than a club for straight dating, blaming the gays for the fact that no one wants to hang out with you is kinda homophobic. Or at least it acknowledges homophobia against them, but then kinda blames them for it. You were losing members so fast already that James has go out and recruit, and he brings in gays, and now it's their fault no one will hang out with you?? I'm confused.\n\n\nThese particular gays (as described) seem to be pretty rude about other people's sexuality, which is inconsiderate and seems to border on harassment, if it isn't harassment. Also, these gays should know most of the girls in gay bars are straight. Some of them bring their straight boyfriends.

Gay people not wanting to socialize with straight people, who often stigmatize and mistreat them, in larger organized events is normal and you are not very accepting of that. Just because a gay person trusts a couple of straight people doesn't mean they will enjoy a party with a bunch of straight people they most likely can't trust.
