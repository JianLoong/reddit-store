She would **never** babysit her students outside of a dire emergency. It\u2019s thankfully explicitly stated at her school that teachers are not allowed to offer private services, such as babysitting or tutoring, to students at the school. \n\nBecause what that mother mentioned is 100% correct. Having your third grade teacher babysit your third grader is going to create conflicts. Favoritism will arise, either for or against your child, and other students **will** pick up on it. Your third grader will mention that Mr. XYZ was over one night and the classroom will go wild about it. Third graders are nosy little shits and this will eventually become a classroom incident to deal with. \n\nAlso your handling of the situation is embarrassing for a grown ass man. Fat feet? Really? Maybe next time you have some one on one time with your third graders teacher you have him remind you how people are meant to behave and treat others. You know, shit you were supposed to learn in elementary school?", "\u201cI said she had fat feet.\u201d\n\nINFO: Is that an expression I\u2019m unfamiliar with or were you literally saying she has fat feet?\n\nAdditional INFO: What made you use that of all of the world\u2019s possible insults?", ">I reminded her that I was standing right in front of her too.\n\nINFO: WTF does that mean?

YTA. If you were concerned about Mr. Fletcher you should have approached him and let him know that another parent at the school had said such-and-such, and you were concerned that if it was true and because she knew, his job might be at stake if he continues.  Then he could have told you either no it's false in which case you can ignore the mother, or he could have admitted that yes it was true and you two could have talked about whether you felt comfortable continuing to employ him knowing that, and/or if he felt comfortable continuing knowing that since other people know he's sitting for students, he could be reported at any time and lose his job over it.\n\nBased on the response you actually gave... I don't even know what to say.  Your youngest is going to learn lessons in kindergarten that will see his maturity level and conflict resolution skills quickly outstrip your own.  You should be concerned about that.
