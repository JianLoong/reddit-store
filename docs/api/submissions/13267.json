{"id": 13267, "submission_id": "122v1z6", "title": "AITA for telling my mom it will be her fault if all of her kids have no relationship with her.", "selftext": "My (18f) mom (46f) was cleaning the house and was mad because it was \"her only day off\". She yelled at my younger brother for leaving a cup out (as he is notorious for doing so), and he said it wasn't his. My younger sister admitted to it being hers and my mom said \"sorry it wasn't you *this time\"*. I told her that it was rude to give him a half-assed apology like that and also if she was mad about cleaning on her day off, she should have just had everyone cleaning up for 5-15 minutes every day to keep the house clean. My dad cleans up after himself and does most of the chores in the house all while working 2 remote jobs. He only ever occasionally asks for help. I also explained to my mom that she does only work about 4 hours a day (including commute) and that she had plenty of time every day to work on sections of the house if it bothers her so bad. She yelled at me to not tell her what she \"needs\" to do, and that her hormones are all over the place right now (she might be potentially going through menopause) so I need to be nicer to her. I told her that I am being nice to her and trying to suggest how to properly handle this issue. She stormed out to go on a walk, and I explained to my dad what happened after he heard the door slam.\n\nWhen my mom came back I had asked her if she'd like to continue the conversation like an adult, to which she said no but I told her then she can just listen to me talk if she doesn't want to have a whole conversation. She instantly starts yelling and telling me I'm being a massive bitch and a jerk. I try calmly explaining to her that if she keeps being rude to my younger siblings, they're going to end up just like me and my older sister. This is when I laid it on her that I've had no relationship with her for at least 4 years, and that I see her more as an explosive little sibling that I have to walk on eggshells around. She got mad and told me (I am autistic and have ADHD btw) that my brain only really works \"half the time\". I flat out told her that her friends have rotted her brain into thinking that because she's a parent she's always right, and after some back and forth with my dad even trying to get her to listen to me, she walked out screaming about how she clearly can't stay in this house any longer. My brother is sobbing about how he thinks my mom and dad are going to get divorced and I called her on it right then and there that she's a manipulative and self-centered POS who uses this to garner sympathy from my siblings. I said if she cared about my siblings, she wouldn't be acting like this. After hearing this, she quickly ran up into her room saying she'll \"be a prisoner in her own house\".\n\nMy dad said I was being an asshole because the kids didn't see what she was doing as emotional manipulation, but are distressed at me trying to show them. My older sister however, said I wasn't the asshole, but unfortunately the kids are just going to have to see later in life how she was emotionally manipulative. AITA?\n\n**EDIT:** I see a lot of people saying I'm the asshole and I have nothing but disrespect for my mother. I would like to add I have tried to repair our relationship MULTIPLE times, but she ends up blowing up at me for one thing or another. Something as simple as getting my own savings account to save up and move out she gets mad at, and even calls me ridiculous for. This is also not new behavior and in times when her and my dad have gotten into arguments, I was the one who had to run after her and try to get her to come back, so I do see where my little brother is coming from.\n\nI do acknowledge I was being an asshole in the fact that I did continue the argument, but I really just want her to see how she's affecting this family in a very negative way, and has been for multiple years now.  \n\n\n**EDIT2:** Also, I would like to add that I do clean around the house when I can. I'm not home most of the time because I do house sitting and stay they night with people's dogs / pets while they are out of town and such. My dad also cleans when he can, and gets stressed at how messy the house can get. He works almost 60+ hours a week for his 2 jobs and he, at the very least, makes sure that his area and room are clean and loads up dishes. It's just that when I try and tell my siblings to help around the house, they give me the \"you're not my mom so don't tell me what to do\" and then my mom says that I need to stop trying to be a mom and \"take her place\". My dad, again, works a LOT, so he doesn't have a lot of time to make sure the stuff actually gets done until he gets a break from work!", "created_utc": 1679855457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122v1z6/aita_for_telling_my_mom_it_will_be_her_fault_if/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mom laughed at it and joked about \"trying it on me\" at some point because my older sister basically raised me to not take shit from her and to (at the very least) stand up for my siblings, if not myself.\n\nThe \"friend\" had joked about how embarrassed her daughter was at the uneven hair chopping and told her that she only took her to get it fixed a week later so she \"learned her lesson\".  \n\n\nEDIT: As for why I praise my father, it's because he does work VERY hard around the house to try and keep it clean. It's just that he works almost 60+ hours a week and has very little down time. Typically his off days will include him doing dishes, making dinner, taking out trash, and various other things that he can get done before he gets exhausted.

I am just afraid of my siblings getting the same treatment I did.", "I added more context in the edits, but I am trying to explain to everyone I can.

It happens every single time.", "That's kinda how I feel too. A lot of people seem to be thinking I'm just a mooch off my parents, and it's the exact opposite and that I think I know everything. I clean around the house when I have the free time to and do the dishes. I do a lot of chores, and I also have a job. I take care of my siblings a lot of the time when my dad is busy and my mom just doesn't want to, but it seems like a lot of people just kinda ignore that part for the sake of trying to think I'm the \"fresh 18 year old know-it-all\" when all I was trying to do was make sure my siblings + my mom actually get to have a relationship as opposed to me and my sister. We both don't want to see them go down the path we did because we cannot talk to her.", "My dad was suggesting I possibly go to therapy *with* my mom one week to try and see if that works out, but I'm thinking about therapy as a way to almost vent to a professional about the issues.", "I gave more context in the edits, but my mom has been doing this for literal years.

I would beg her to come back home, because I didn't want my parents to divorce. My dad also isn't *not* doing parenting. He lets us vent to him, he at least makes us dinner even when he is in the middle of working or on a job call. He makes himself emotionally available every second he can and even when me and him have big arguments, we eventually both calm down and do talk about it like adults.\n\nThe reason my siblings don't clean around the house (or even really pick up after themselves) is because my mom simply doesn't actually tell them to do so. My dad has tried everything he can to get them to do chores. Offering money, offering candy / treats / special dinner, but they don't do it.

They refocus on other targets. Your sister, then you, then the siblings. This will not change no matter how much you talk to her. She is abusive. She will abuse. You are just creating more stress for you and other people.\n\nFocus on moving out.", "That's not your business. None of this is your business. Your brother and sister wouldn't have to deal with it if they would get off their asses and help or clean up after themselves which you admit they do not do. And apparently you were okay with watching your mom clean on her only day off while sitting on your ass and educating her about how she should be better at cleaning throughout the week? Jesus christ. Who the hell do you think you are? LMAO", "You realize that \u201cexperiencing both parents\u201d means that both parents get worse as the years pass? Your mom and I are the same age.  My parents couldn\u2019t stand each other but they stayed together \u201cfor me\u201d which was common back then. All that did was force me to live with their bullshit instead of at least one of them modeling what a happy adult looked like for me. They are not doing any of you any favors by staying together.", "Yes,  good insight.   So sad but true.", "My brother and sister are KIDS. I don't expect them to just get up and clean, especially because they were both already in their rooms playing games. I try to encourage them to clean up when they get home, even if it's just putting any dishes they see out into the sink so we can run a load. I just get told to not tell them what to do because I'm not their mom, and my mom agrees with them.\n\nI also never said I didn't help, but it seems a lot of people just assume that. I had been helping throughout the week with cleaning the house + I was getting my room set up since I was getting a new bed frame + desk, so I needed to make sure my room was all cleaned out for that. I'd also like to state, since a lot of people were missing this, **my dad typically does most of the chores in the house, including cleaning.** She gets to sit on her ass all day, every single day she comes home from work. It's frustrating. As I said in my last post though, I'm more looking out for my siblings than anyone else in this. I want them to at least feel like they can talk to their mom. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her CONSTANTLY.", "You said your siblings are 13 and 14. They are teenagers. They are not children. I was stacking wood, raking leaves, doing chores, walking our family dog, doing laundry, cleaning bathrooms, organizing the garage, helping out with dinner, helping out with other tasks around the house from the time I was six years old until the day I graduated high school. I was given three options when I graduated: get a job, go to college, or join the military. This ADHD diagnosis response rebuttal is \\*exactly\\* why the United States is failing to find able-bodied work in an economy where you can make nearly as much as an adult right now. It's absolutely insufferable. I had my first part time job at 14. That is the SAME EXACT AGE as one of the SO-CALLED CHILDREN as you like to call your siblings. I saved up TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS working PART TIME while doing my homework and achieving a 4.0 gpa. I've ALSO been diagnosed bipolar with fucking depression. I don't understand your excuses. I will never understand your excuses and if I ever was in the position to hire someone like you in the future I straight up wouldn't. Keep that in mind miss attitude. You think your mom is abusive? My mother and I used to get in actual FIST FIGHTS and I lived in a very similar environment. Your excuses do not fly with me and I am laughing so hard at your hilarious sense of entitlement that tears are coming from my eyes; straight up savage salty tears of boo-hoo princess tears.", "I'm confused? 13 and 14 are still kids. Teenagers are still kids. They deserve to enjoy time with their friends and play games. I get you were raised differently that me, and that's okay. I had a job in high school. I was working 35 hours a week with early release my Senior year. I don't know what my ADHD has to do with this as I only stated it due to the fact my mother used it as an insult to me, and quite frankly you sound incredibly ableist. My ADHD did not prevent me from getting a job. I have a job currently. Also, in my state you can't work until you're 16. So they couldn't get a job if they wanted to, but I know my brother wants to start looking on his 16th birthday. My dad said he doesn't need to worry about that, and focus to focus on school.\n\nI'm sorry you and your mom got into fist fights, but that does not mean it is okay for parents to emotionally manipulate their kids either. I'm sorry you experience physical abuse, and that isn't okay. But I don't think that gives you the right to downplay anybody else's abuse. I'm just going to block and move on since you clearly think belittling the abuse others experience is a good idea.", "This is the exact response I expect from an 18 year old who wants to argue that a 13 and 14 year old deserve to have time with their friends and play instead of you know wiping their own asses. Then again I'm not surprised you turned out the way you did considering your mother taught you that teenager shouldn't have to clean up after themselves or do any housework LMAO. I guess there's still children who are allowed to dance and play instead of doing chores up until the clock strikes midnight on their 18th birthday then suddenly they start contributing to the household and become an expert on how to manage things and then can also lecture their mother and how she should be running her household and cleaning up better after them.", "YTA. You are egging your mom on. You didn\u2019t need to condescend. You don\u2019t need to try to parent her. Clean up around the house more, and tell your siblings to pick up after themselves. You all should be contributing to chores.", "NTA. You sound very rational and are trying to actively find a solution to this chaos.\n\nMother sounds entitled, self-righteous, petulant, apathetic, belittling, and antagonistic. She does not listen to anyone. She does not listen to reasoning. She expects people to read her mind. You most definitely are walking on eggshells around her, because she lashes out if you don\u2019t.\n\nYou try to provide some constructive criticism, she blows up. I\u2019m assuming she feels shame from the criticism, and it turns to rage. This is a narcissistic habit.\n\nEverybody\u2019s emotions in a household are important and valid; it is a balancing process. The scale is tipped far too much in your mother\u2019s favor and she keeps demanding more. Everyone else in that house is suffering because of her.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s more prevalent because she is going through menopause, but I\u2019m will to bet it has always been there.\n\nChildren are not an obligation to their parents, because they never had the choice in the first place.", "ESH... you have a lot of good points. BUT... you don't get to parent your mom. Lecturing her, asking if she's ready to act like an adult, and then saying you're going to continue speaking down to her anyway is out of line. It's not really okay to talk to other people like that in general unless they are your actual children, and even then you can usually find a better way.", "Yta you sound bananas patronizing towards your mother.\n\nYou then *demanded* she listen as you continue to bitch her out.\n\nYou're 18 with all the wealth of knowledge of 18 years.  She's 46yo, with 46 years of knowing. You then try prancing in telling her how to live her life.  And are SHOCKED it doesn't go well.", "And who exactly raised them to be that way? You as the parent need to teach them to do them at a responsible rate", "I don't know. As Howard Beale says in Network, \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.\"", "why doesn't your father just get a divorce. according to your post he does everything anyway?", "They are 13 and 14. That is more than old enough to cook themselves something to eat for dinner.", "I have 26 year old housemate who seems incapable of cleaning up after himself without me telling him, we even have a dishwasher he can't be bothered putting stuff into without a reminder.", "Sounds like his crap needs to start piling up in front of his door", "Your dad should not be talking to you about issues in his marriage. That is not appropriate at all.", "He'd just step over it and carry on with his day. He has his eyes constantly glued to TikTok while the rest of the world happens around him."]}
