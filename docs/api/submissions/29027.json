I think yous hould show your parents this Post and let them reald all the responses.\n\nThey have to understand that many girls who are lesbians try to be \"normal\" as they grow up, because we (yes, me too) dont have many lesbian rolemodels in books or tv. Can your parents name one movie they watched with you that ahd a nice lesbian couple? Can they name a chidlrens book with 2 princesses finding each other? No... So we often try to be with men, and sometimes we even think its normal that we dont enjoy the sex etc, because too often other women tell us that its normal to have men see our orgasm as optional. Also they way lesbians are sexualized by pornsick men is scaring a lot of women away at first. Too many find out in their 30s that they are lesbians and have a true sexual awakening after the first GF. You are lucky to have the courage to be honest with yourself at a young age. You safed yourself long years of confusion and suffering.\n\nYour parents should be glad. And your mother has to step up and safe your from a man that views being staight as normal and you as abnormal obviously.\n\nTell your mother she should be glad that you even trust her with your sexuality in the first place. Others, like myself will never come out to my parents. They will forever think i m just a simster with cats and a female best friend who seems to hand out at my place too often.
