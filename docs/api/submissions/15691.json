You do realize your cousin could be seriously injured or dead right? There is a time and place for malicious compliance, but when it involves animals children the elderly or the disabled being harmed? Not the time nor place", "ESH \n\nYour aunt is TA for telling you off for protecting her baby and not watching him in the first place.\n\nBut you\u2019re also TA, because while there is a place and time for malicious compliance, this is not it. It\u2019s pretty cruel to just watch a kid hurt themselves to prove a point, especially since you had no way of knowing whether he would be hurt only slightly, or majorly.", "Wooowww.. no more invites for aunt to you home.. and you got to do the cooking too? There wouldn\u2019t be any more events in my home..\n\nYou made a bad move standing there watching the baby instead of saying something.. I wanna say ain\u2019t got what she asked for but baby doesn\u2019t know any better..", "i think its high time to ban this particular aunt. any future baby should be in a play pen if not being directly held or Actually supervised", "YTA. You actually WATCHED a child on their way to hurting themselves, potentially very badly, and didn\u2019t do anything because you wanted to prove a point to a bad parent. Dude. You should have snatched up the baby, handed the baby to the aunt and said \u201cI just stopped your baby from falling down the stairs. You need to watch your child or leave.\u201d", "NTA I would however say to your family that they can either find somewhere else to host their events and you will not allow them at your home or they can adequately supervise their children ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH THEM.", "YTA\n\nI get that you're pissed and wanted to 'listen to your aunt's words\" right down to the last moment. But intentionally watching a 15 month old baby crawl towards stairs and fall off is another level of cynical. What if he died? What if he got maimed for life from that? Could you live with yourself, knowing that it happened just cause you were being petty? \n\nSometimes you just need to be the bigger person and go beyond your pettiness. If you really wanted to shove it in your aunt's face that she was wrong, save her baby, and then tell her \"I told you so\".", "NTA - but ban her from the house.", "YTA.  It's a baby.  You don't want to touch it based on prior comment, fine-- you see the baby head that way and yell \"Auntie!\"\n\nNo matter what anyone says you never let a baby go down stairs or off a ledge.  The fact it only got a bump does not excuse you.  You know this already.", "YTA. As much as I (usually) love malicious compliances, you put a baby in danger just to prove a point - and even worse, YOU WATCHED IT AND DID NOTHING. This is petty, irresponsible and dangerous. It's a BABY, ffs. What if something more serious had happened than a small bump on the head?", "ESH.  I know the kid isn't yours and she did say not to touch him but if there's danger and you know of it, it would have been infinitely wise to break that rule and keep him from crawling outside. Invest in a playpen of some sort too.", "NTA your aunt should have been watching the kid.", "ESH. I'm all for malicious compliance, until it involves a literal BABY getting injured. Watching a baby hurt themselves to make a point is sociopathic behavior. Also, if you're going to host family with small children and leave doors open, invest in a baby gate.", "NTA You were told not to touch the kid and to let him crawl around. She absolved you of all responsibility. TA here is/are the bad parent(s) They let their kid crawl around unsupervised and unrestricted, what kind of parent does that.", "ESH. Your aunt doesn't sound like a great parent. But the \"not your kid, not your problem\" mindset is a bit harsh when it comes to small children. For an older child that doesn't listen and your aunt is acting the same, sure, that's her problem. But it is an infant. You shouldn't blame them for your aunt not acting responsibly.\r  \n\r  \nA baby could potentially die from a tumble like this. Anyone can, but especially an infant. Sure, \"not your kid, not your problem\", but if that baby ended up SERIOUSLY injured, would you have been okay with just watching?\r  \n\r  \nAnd as an aside: No, I'm not a parent, so this isn't coming from the \"entitled mindset of a parent\". I don't even want my own children. But my morals wouldn't allow me to just let this happen to a child, even if the parent is being irresponsible. If someone told me \"It's fine, my toddler crosses the road all the time by themselves\", I'm still not going to watch them step in front of a car.", "ESH\n\nYour aunt is TA for being dumb enough to insist her child should be allowed to freely crawl in dangerous places. \n\nYou're TA for allowing a child to be hurt. A kid shouldn't be collateral damage in petty arguments between adults.", "NTA he's gotta learn at some point not to crawl out of doors, why not start him early. Also call your aunt out. She needs to watch her baby so that he doesn't get hurt. That's on her", "I mean....how many steps was it?", "NTA. Tell your family to host their gatherings elsewhere next time.", "NTA.", "YTA the day before you put something in front of the steps, why not this time?\n\nTraumatic brain injury is not a good excuse to go 'but you told me bla bla'", "NTA! The kid isn\u2019t badly hurt and you did listen to your dumb ass aunt\u2019s instructions.", "NTA, I would have done the same. Your aunt specifically demand you keep your hands off her child so you're only following the parents wishes. I would be more discreet and leave the kitchen so I could return and act surprise, that way your aunt gets the blame. Stop opening your house to hosting these ungrateful AH, they're that mad fine, find someone else's home to host.", "NTA\n\nNot your kid, not your problem.  You did the exact right thing!", "nta, she bitched at you for literally doing what they're now bitching at your for NOT doing?  fuck that...\n\nshe fucked around, and she found out, lol.  the baby didn't die did it?  disabled for life?  no?  then ok.", "ESH. Your aunt should have been watching her kid and knew it, which is why she lashed out at you. She certainly shouldn\u2019t have left the kid unsupervised a second time in similar circumstances.
