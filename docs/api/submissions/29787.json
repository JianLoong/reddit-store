We separated almost 4 years ago when I learned he was sleeping around throughout most of our marriage and he even had a girlfriend for over a year. He moved in with her after I started divorce proceedings. Their son was born during the divorce. Ex and I share custody and split Christmas every year. We do all our communication through an app. Or we're supposed to anyway.\n\nEx's girlfriend left him and their son just after the baby turned 1. He's now 3.\n\nWhenever I see ex's mom, who lives 20 minutes from me, she always mentions how she wishes I was the mom to her other grandson and how sad it is he doesn't have a mom. I was always a little suspicious of comments like that because what good do they do? It made me aware that he and his family might want me to be involved in this little boy's life.\n\nLast week ex texted me and said he was thinking about the future. How he has two boys and how he wants his son to grow up with memories of Christmas always including his brother and maybe having more family than he currently does. So how about we stop with the conflict and come together every Christmas and I could get to know his son more and be part of his life and we would both see our son Christmas Day. He brought up how our son isn't really as close to his son as he wanted him to be and that his son smiles whenever he sees me and would love to interact with me. The text was long and he brought up a lot of points. To sum it up he wanted us to do joint Christmas' going forward and for me to be in his son's life. I ignored the part about his son and I said no to joint Christmas'. Ex did not leave it there and he tried to convince me by using the \"I know you hate Christmas when our son isn't with you\" and he's not wrong. But we are not going to get along enough for that. His cheating ended any chance for that. I also do not want his son to become attached to me or seek a mom figure in me.\n\nSo I said no and no again when he didn't give up and I stopped replying.\n\nI saw ex and his mom Wednesday when I was grabbing some groceries while my son was at his best friend's house. They came right up to me and said I should be more compassionate and see the win in having Christmas all together. His mom again mentioned how sad it is that his son doesn't have a mom and ex told me I am going to come between the boys if our son figures out how much I don't want to be around his half brother. He told me to do better and stop being such an ass to him and his son. His mom was like \"be the amazing mom we know you are\". She wasn't mad but he was furious and I know it won't be the least time he brings it up.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698430503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17htssh/aita_for_rejecting_my_exs_offer_to_do_joint/", "score": 1235, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I'm feeling like a bit of an asshole and worrying that I am going too far is my son. While he has never complained about doing Christmas the way he does, I know there are kids with divorced parents who would love to get everyone together. Plus I know it's been a few years and I should be able to tolerate doing more things with my ex for my son and even my ex's other child. So by rejecting the idea and not even giving it a trial run, I wonder if I'm behaving poorly enough to be called an AH.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then you find out your husband is a cheating sleaze for almost the entirety of your relationship and that he had a 'main' side piece for an entire year before you find out. You divorce him, she gets pregnant, and then ghosts him and their child. And yet he wants some sort of compassion and connection from you 'for the boys sake'?\n\nDo I have that right, OP? On the off chance I'm overcomplicating or oversimplifying things, please let me know.\n\nOkay, where do I start?\n\n1. His mom- Response: \"Yeah, I AM an amazing mom. I am an amazing woman and your son was lucky to have me but he decided that having me wasn't enough. And he chose to cheat for a vast majority of our relationship. He chose to impregnate a woman who was just as unstable and unreliable as he was to me and our son. I'm sorry that his child is growing up without a mom, but the fact is that if your son had been raised with some morals and some values and could keep his d!@$ in his pants that son would have been mine, too. I'm not responsible for the fuckups in his life.\"\n2. Him- \"I have nothing to do with how our son sees his brother or their closeness. I've never spoken against your son or you for that matter, to our son. I never will. You have the life that you chose.

Why don't you try any of the countless other women you cheated on me with to help you raise him. We don't have a good relationship because you ruined everything good about us with your lies and cheating. You need to own that and stop trying to make me your scapegoat.

He\u2019s probably looking to be able to dump his other kid on you.   He gets a break from your son when he\u2019s with you but not from his other son.  It\u2019s his responsibility as the father or both these boys to create a cohesive family.  While I do feel bad for the boy who probably wishes he had a mother present in his life, it\u2019s never a good idea to push kids where they arent wanted.", "Your ex cheated on you, got his mistress pregnant, mistress had enough and left him and their son.\n\nNow your ex wants you to play \"mommy\" to a child conceived while he was married to you???

Nothing else.\n\nIf his mother continues to mettle, explain to her that you are surprised that he is suddenly so concerned about two parent families as he certainly didn't care about your son when he was off banging everything he could.

Don\u2019t be fooled, which it sounds like you\u2019re not, this is all a manipulation to try and get you back into mom role for his benefit.", "NTA. Absolutely not. You have made your choice and he needs to accept reality.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe the nerve they have to say that to you after everything he put you through. Hell no, if you don\u2019t want it don\u2019t do it. He gave you up when he cheated and had no respect for you.", "NTA.  Don't allow your ex to teach your son how to treat you like crap. Your ex doesn't want to parent his own kid.  If he knocks up someone else, you'll be taking care of them, too.", "His Mom needs to squash her urge to wipe her son\u2019s butt. Ex made the decision to crush the likelihood of shared Christmas a long time ago. There are no do-overs.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like **he's looking for a replacement mom** for the child he's now responsible for.   This isn't about the boys, no matter how much he pretends it is.  It's about what Ex wants.   Or rather, what he doesn't want.  \n\nI'm guessing he doesn't like having all the responsibility, and wants someone to do the work of parenting for his son, and thinks if he gets you around this child, you will get sucked in.  And his mother is playing along. \n\n**They are both showing you, all over again, that you were wise to have him be your Ex.**  They say \"compassionate\" but they mean \"compliant.\"  They are looking to use you.  They pretend this is to your benefit, to your son's benefit, but it's not.  It's to Ex's benefit.     \n\nThere's no win for you in this.  There's only more manipulation and pain.  \n\nYou aren't *coming between* the brothers at all.  Your son and his other son can see each other when Ex gets visits.  That's plenty of opportunity for Ex to do things with them both.  Ex and his mother are inventing all kinds of nonsense to try to drag you into their problems.  \n\n*He told me to do better and stop being such an ass to him and his son.* \n\nUtter nonsense.  ***You*** are not the problem here.  Ex is.  But **Ex is trying to make you be his solution.**  You might want to change some of your erranding habits, so they can't keep running into you.  \n\n*I know it won't be the least time he brings it up.*\n\nYou might want to talk to your lawyer about this.  **This is quickly turning into harassment.**  Maybe you can get one of those apps set up, and have all communication go through that, so you have records to prove how you are being harassed now.  Or if you see them in public, just hold up your phone and start recording and sending it to someone else.  Maybe practice saying \"I'm not discussing your other child, only our son.\"  \"I'm not discussing a child that isn't mine.\"  \"I will not be your solution to whatever problems you are having with your youngest child.\" \n\nYou should not have to put up with this.

You are evidently an amazing mom to your son you birthed. Or else they wouldn\u2019t keep coming after you to mother his younger son.", "Tell his mom to mind HER business for crying out loud. How about she worry about the cheater she raised as a mother instead of what kind of mother you\u2019re being to your son? Definitely NTA. They can beat it.", "Yeah, you aren\u2019t the one driving a wedge between the brothers.   the logical solution is for ex and his son to spend EVERY Christmas with grandma.   Then your son gets to join them every other year.    the baby doesn\u2019t know any differently than what he is experiencing now.  If dad is a good dad, kid won\u2019t realize there is something different for a few more years, and if kid is feeling well loved the questions will be minimal (and none of your business).  If you and ex-MIL get along you could try having a conversation with her and explain that you will always resent your ex for leaving you for another woman and it seems heartless of your former MIL to try and gloss over that.   You wish the child no ill-will, but you also do not want to have anything to do with that child other than minimal contact.    If that makes you heartless, then so be it.   You think it is pretty heartless of her and self-serving of her son to expect you to welcome your ex\u2019s affair child into your heart.   You were not the one who strayed, yet now they want to punish you more for his transgressions", "Translation: raising a little kid alone is hard and being a grandma of two is hard as well, so why not asking you to become the official unpaid babysitter?\n\nAlso, maybe it's time to check if they're somehow pressuring/poisoning your son\n\nEdit: NTA, massive NTA", "Nta maybe he should have done better and not cheated on you and you all could have been having family Christmas time.", "NTA, absolutely not. shut that shit down.", "Nta\n\nHe wants you to be his mommy so he can have time and fuck around more.", "NTA.

I don\u2019t want my or his mental health destroyed by the constant reminder that my husband was unable to control himself and behave like a real man. Please stop this nonsense.

We separated almost 4 years ago when I learned he was sleeping around throughout most of our marriage and he even had a girlfriend for over a year. He moved in with her after I started divorce proceedings. Their son was born during the divorce. Ex and I share custody and split Christmas every year. We do all our communication through an app. Or we're supposed to anyway.\n\nEx's girlfriend left him and their son just after the baby turned 1. He's now 3.\n\nWhenever I see ex's mom, who lives 20 minutes from me, she always mentions how she wishes I was the mom to her other grandson and how sad it is he doesn't have a mom. I was always a little suspicious of comments like that because what good do they do? It made me aware that he and his family might want me to be involved in this little boy's life.\n\nLast week ex texted me and said he was thinking about the future. How he has two boys and how he wants his son to grow up with memories of Christmas always including his brother and maybe having more family than he currently does. So how about we stop with the conflict and come together every Christmas and I could get to know his son more and be part of his life and we would both see our son Christmas Day. He brought up how our son isn't really as close to his son as he wanted him to be and that his son smiles whenever he sees me and would love to interact with me. The text was long and he brought up a lot of points. To sum it up he wanted us to do joint Christmas' going forward and for me to be in his son's life. I ignored the part about his son and I said no to joint Christmas'. Ex did not leave it there and he tried to convince me by using the \"I know you hate Christmas when our son isn't with you\" and he's not wrong. But we are not going to get along enough for that. His cheating ended any chance for that. I also do not want his son to become attached to me or seek a mom figure in me.\n\nSo I said no and no again when he didn't give up and I stopped replying.\n\nI saw ex and his mom Wednesday when I was grabbing some groceries while my son was at his best friend's house. They came right up to me and said I should be more compassionate and see the win in having Christmas all together. His mom again mentioned how sad it is that his son doesn't have a mom and ex told me I am going to come between the boys if our son figures out how much I don't want to be around his half brother. He told me to do better and stop being such an ass to him and his son. His mom was like \"be the amazing mom we know you are\". She wasn't mad but he was furious and I know it won't be the least time he brings it up.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Trust me I split up with mine for the same reason plus some extra reasons 4 years ago. I tried to do joint things for awhile. But he also never kept the kids. He would just stop by my house to see them. And it got old quick. It's just not worth the stress if you guys have any issues. Like I know I try my hardest to be amicable bc I want the kids to see I can put the issues aside but not at my own expense either. I'm not going to see him constantly. Plus mine always used those opportunities to try to \"win me back\" even when i said absolutely not.  And I think in your case that's also what will happen. Esp if he wants you to be in his others sons life. He can't mean just on Christmas so he will start expecting you around more and more. Then asking you to keep his son sometimes to \"bond with his brother\" while trying to weasel his way back in. That's 100% what I see happening in the future. \n\nHis son is not your responsibility. And neither is the bond between the boys. So it's on him to make sure his sons bond.   I think it will cause more issues bc yeah it's not the kids fault but unfortunately the kid becomes a constant reminder of the affair. And that's stressful. Don't feel bad for wanting to keep your parenting separate. I see no need to play \"big happy family\" on holidays. I feel my kids benefit more from me being good mentally and seeing that boundaries are okay to have.  And so far that's worked. My oldest esp is 14 and he sees how his dad is and he doesn't want me around him more than necessary either. Bc he knows it upsets me when he tries to overstep and stomp on my boundaries constantly.  NTA. I know co parenting can be hard sometimes but just stick to your boundaries. And your son will understand. Yeah if dad starts putting ideas in his head he might get upset sometimes but kids understand and see more than we think...", "NTA, I would tell them they should throw that energy towards his son bio mom/family", "I never comment on here but this one hits a little close to home for me. My parents are divorced and have been since I was four. My parents fight, argue, and scream frequently even still after the divorce (18ish years later). (It was also a similar cheating situation but the woman my father got with already had two kids from a previous partnership and divorced their father and my father and this woman never had a child together) HOWEVER\nThe one thing my parents could agree on was that they wanted me to have memorable and healthy relationships with holidays. No matter how they felt about each other, the situation, anything like that, they agreed to put my welfare first and we would always spend big holidays together as a trio. My father never asked to include the kids from his other relationship (granted they live in a totally different state 11ish hours away) but it was also agreed upon that it was my decision if I wanted a relationship with them or not when I was older. I was never forced to visit them. Holidays (Christmas/thanksgiving and Halloween when I was little) and my birthday were/are the only times of the year my parents could really act civil and put my needs/wants as a young child before their bickering and hatred for each other. \nSo, OP, I think in this situation you\u2019re going through (while similar) is a little different. IMO I\u2019d offer the idea of spending Christmas together for the benifit of YOUR child that you gave birth to, but set the boundry that the child from the other relationship is not your responsibility. If your ex was truly concerned for the well-being of your child he wouldn\u2019t force a \u201cjoint\u201d Christmas with the other kid as well, but with the child he inseminated (?) you with while in a marriage. IMO it doesn\u2019t look like that. It looks like he\u2019s trying to pawn off this other child and make you take care of them/be their mother which is not healthy for anyone involved. If you resent a child and are forced to raise them, that\u2019s never good for anyone involved. \nSo tbh i think y\u2019all are both kinda at fault here in different ways. I think the well-being of your child should come first, at the same time being forced to take care of someone else\u2019s child that you resent is unfair and unhealthy (for both you and the child). I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it. This really is a difficult situation. I hope everything works out in the end and you find the peace/comfort you deserve.

Tell him he humiliated you, destroyed the marriage/family and your opinion of him is forever changed.\nIf your son were to approach you and tell you it is something HE wanted, I would suggest you consider it, but in the meantime I think it is absolutely reasonable for you to not want to spend holidays with your ex.", "And you\u2019re not going to enjoy Christmas with your son either if you have to spend all day putting on a polite act.  Would they expect you to buy gifts for his affair child too?", "It sounds like your ex is trying to make it out like he wants you all to be civil and play family at Christmas, but really he's just trying to get you to warm up to his kid so you can be his new mom. Just be straight with your ex and tell him bluntly that you can be civil with his kid, but what he is actually asking you to do is take an active mother role in his life, and that is the real reason he wants you involved in his life. And that's something you absolutely WILL NOT do. Tell him you don't hate his son but you CAN'T love him and you don't want his son to get the wrong idea. And also add that he should NOT be looking for a substitute mother in someone who CANNOT love his son. Which by the way is a huge audacity considering the circumstances!", "exactly this and his younger son is only 3 - so a very needy age.", "Yep. He wants the custody agreement to apply to both kids. So OP takes them both instead of just her bio son. He's probably jealous OP gets some days without her kid, but he doesn't.", "This is what I got out of this too.  He's not asking about Christmas, not as his endgame.  He wants her to coparent both sons because he doesn't like single parenting.   He probably still wants to be out on the town (from a prior comment) with multiple other partners.  Dude seems like he'll try to dump the second child on his prior wife and continue to play.", "My go to is \"I am not a reliable option. I am sure you will firgure out though.\"\n\nOr in the case of OP. \"I am not a sustainable resolution. I am sure you will figure it out though.\"", "JADE - Justify, Argue, Defend & Explain.  When dealing with difficult people, the Jade technique is just a reminder that you don't need to justify or defend your decisions as doing so only sends the message that the difficult person/people can continue pushing their narrative.  What you do is give \"shut them down\" responses like \"that doesn't work for me\" that you repeat until that person backs down.", "I love the line about Madame Karma. That's perfect in so scenarios.", "And the part that is left unsaid is that if the ex found a new partner, she would be unlikely to want joint Christmas with his ex, and OP would be immediately discarded.\n\nEven if OP was somehow amendable to this plan (totally NTA for not being amendable), it would still be problematic because it would only be feasible if the ex never wants to be in a serious relationship ever again.", "I honestly do feel sorry for the the kid (that is, the half-brother of OP's kid).\n\nHe's 3 years old, his mom abandoned him when he was 1, his dad is a deadbeat loser, and... yeah.\n\nI know OP's ex is just trying to pawn off the kid on OP as a sort of \"free child care\" grift with these \"big family Christmases\". \n\nFirst it's \"Oh, the boys loves doing Christmas together\", then it's \"Oh, we should have a big family get together for their birthdays\", and then OP ends up being stuck parenting her kid's half-brother all the time, while deadbeat goes off to find another woman to sleep with.\n\nOP doesn't want to be a mom or maternal figure to her kid's half-brother, which is reasonable.\n\nTo be honest, as things are, I don't see a situation where the two kids ever develop a \"close\" bond as brothers. If anything, I bet OP's ex is gonna \"brainwash\" his younger son into hating his older half-brother by encouraging a sense of jealousy, by saying things like \"Your older brother gets to celebrate birthdays and Christmases, because OP and your brother want to rub their happy relationship in our faces\".", "It won\u2019t be long before he asks OP to take both kids during custody swap because \u201cit isn\u2019t fair\u201d that her son gets to do stuff and the little one \u201cfeels left out\u201d.  \u201cThey\u2019re brothers after all.\u201d\n/s", "It sounds like OP knows there is a potential for conflict with a joint Christmas and it will invite more boundary pushing behaviors, I think she has to be the parent here and not involve their son.", "I don\u2019t think that would be helpful here. \n\nThere are millions of kids with divorced parents who split or alternate holidays. If it\u2019s handled well, the kids will be fine with it. \n\nAlso, I think you\u2019re missing all the signs  that make it seem like OP\u2019s ex is less worried about their son having a good Christmas and more worried about recruiting OP to be his affair baby\u2019s new mom.", "Great!  Force the kid to be the bad guy, and let him deal with his manipulative guilt-tripping father!  Grade-A parenting right there.", "Kids as young as 8 should not be made to make adult decisions such as where they spend Christmas. It\u2019s the parents decision and I could totally see the dad manipulating the kid to say things like \u201cAsk your mom if your brother can come over.\u201d", "This is perfect.", "Thank you for this gift, I will be making use of it", "Thanks for the explanation - that makes a lot of sense!", "Yes.  I'm all for this being his end goal - to get OP to parent both children.  I think he'll start with something obvious like \"Brother's need christmas together\" and slime into her basically being the main parent for both kids.", "There are ways to put boundaries into place while also allowing your child to see their father at Christmas if they want to. It's better for OP's son to have choice where they can in a difficult situation", "Maybe some kids will be fine with it if it is handled well, but many won't, it is still going to be very confusing and upsetting to not get to see one of your parents on Christmas.\n\nI don't think it's about what OP or OP's ex wants or why, it's about whether or not this child wants to be with one or both parents on Christmas, overall it's better for him to have some control over a turbulent situation than none.", "How is that forcing anyone to be the bad guy? Letting your kids decide what would make them happier for Christmas is good parenting, OP doesn\u2019t have to say it was his decision, she can say it was hers to avoid any conflict", "Why should that be an \"adult decision\"? He is obviously in a difficult decision with divorced parents, why not give him the option to have some control? Also, OP could say it was her choice to prevent his father trying to decide for him", "Because now Dad gets to turn his manipulation from mom to kid.  \"Don't you want your dad to be happy at Christmas?  Don't you want to make your brother happy?\". It's not a fair ask.", "Because, as I said above, his dad could very well start manipulating the situation. The child, not wanting to disappoint dad, starts asking mom for things at dad\u2019s request. As a divorced parent (kids now grown though), this is one of the main things they tell you NOT to do in the parenting class they forced us to take during the divorce.  I don\u2019t know if every state makes divorcing parents take a class, but mine does. Adults do not ask kids to make adult decisions such as where they spend Christmas etc.  They are kids. This puts them in the middle of the parents.", "Yeah but you don\u2019t need to tell the dad about that conversation, OP can say it was her idea and the kid never needs to feel bad", "How would he manipulate his son if OP didn't say it was her son's decision? She could easily just say \"no, I don't want that\", and not say the reason she doesn't want it is that he son does not want it.\n\nAgain, why should whether or not he spends christmas with his dad be an adult decision, that seems like a perfectly fair option to give your child. If the decision was too much OP doesn't have to make him choose, but why not just ask if he would prefer one over another?\n\nShe wouldn't even have to frame it as a \"You're making this decision\" way, she could easily just ask in conversation \"I know it's hard for you not spending Christmas together, do you think you'd enjoy it more if we were celebrating together still?\"", "Great, just tell him to keep a secret from his dad and to lie to his dad if asked.  That won't cause problems at all.", "Because kids of divorced parents often feel like they are disappointing/hurting one parent when forced to choose.  It is much easier to just tell them \u201cYou will do xyz today and then on Friday, we\u2019ll do abc.\u201d Do you happen to be divorced or have divorced parents?", "I'm not saying ask him to lie, I am saying ask him and then OP can make her decision based on what he wants.\n\nHe never has to keep something secret, and his dad knows it was ultimately up to his mother. When did I say she should ask him to lie? You're just putting words in my mouth now", "No one is being forced to choose, OP can easily sit him down and discuss any of his concerns, tell him it's OK to be upset about not seeing his father, ask him what a good Christmas would look like to him, without him feeling like he is being made to decide something.\n\nI'm sorry but I am not comfortable with discussing mine or my parents relationships here", "Wow, you are just bad at understanding things. Like, multiple people have clearly and repeatedly explained this to you.", "She doesn\u2019t have to spend the day with her ex either. Sometimes coparenting only works if the parents draw healthy boundaries.  She didn\u2019t say anywhere he was upset about not seeing his father so I\u2019m not sure where that came from."]}
