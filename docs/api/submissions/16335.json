You treat both families the same.   People who are respectful, kind and  a positive influence on your kids are allowed access to you and the kids.

It's absurd you're stuck in Texas by yourself.", "[deleted]", "Mostly NTA. At a certain point, it's perfectly reasonable to expect that the burden of travel for interaction should become a shared thing. If you've been doing it for five years and you're no longer interested in doing so because of how much of a hassle it is, it is your right to stay home and say \"if you wanna see them, feel free to hop in the car and we'll be here.\" There's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. However, if they've been allowing you to stay with them when you travel to visit, you should either extend the same courtesy or pay for their hotel expenses. If y'all haven't been staying with them and paying for your own hotels/airbnbs, though, then it's agreeable to expect them to take care of themselves.  \n\n\nAlso, as much as I'm sure you don't want to hear it, saying \"they shouldn't be allowed access to their grandchildren because I don't like how they treat me\" is, in fact, weaponizing your children against your in-laws. Not everyone in the world is going to get along, including family, so if your children wish to see their grandparents, it incredibly inappropriate of you to refuse solely because you don't like them or they don't like you. The \"consequences\" of them treating you in a way that you don't like should be for you to call them out on it and/or refuse to entertain going out of your way to be around them as many times as it takes for them to learn the lesson and change, not punishing your children by denying them the opportunity to see their relatives as a power move.", "\nYou are NTA for not wanting to always haul yourself there (how old and frail are they though?) \n\nYou are NTA for wanting them to put in effort and treat you with respect. \n\nI think YTA for responding to passive aggressive with passive aggressive, and there is a double standard there if you say you deal with problems head on in your family, but aren\u2019t doing it with his. Why tell your husband and not them that you won\u2019t be traveling solo for holidays? Why say they aren\u2019t allowed to stay with you? These sound pretty passive aggressive to me. \n\nInstead, consider calling them to say, directly, how you are feeling.
