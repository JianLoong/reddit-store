I can't go back to my own family because it's not in the funds. I told my husband that I would not be going for the holidays or any other time while he was away and that if they wanted to see their only grandchildren then they would have to make the drive to come see us. I also told him that they are not welcome to stay at the house and would need to find other accommodations. My husband said I was being an asshole and that I had double standards because I don't treat my family this way. However, my family faces problems head on and had never once made me feel like I meant nothing. He's now trying to make me drive down there and talk face to face but I don't want to. Why should I have to be the bigger person again when they clearly want to make no effort on their part. He thinks I'm using my children as weapons. I'm not, I just don't think they should be allowed to show disrespect to me and still have access to my children.

You treat both families the same.   People who are respectful, kind and  a positive influence on your kids are allowed access to you and the kids.   People who are dismissive, rude and model crappy behavior for your kids do not.   If one family gets less access,  it is a direct result of the own jackassery. That's one standard.", "He can drive them there from Korea if he wants your kids to visit his parents so badly. \n\nYou have a three year old and a one year old. That sounds like a horrible drive. They won't talk to you anyway, how are you supposed to plan these supposed trips? Why are you in Texas if he's going to Korea? NTA. I think you need to move back home. It's absurd you're stuck in Texas by yourself.", "I mean a) this isn't the right sub for this, and b) good luck with your impending divorce", "Mostly NTA. At a certain point, it's perfectly reasonable to expect that the burden of travel for interaction should become a shared thing. If you've been doing it for five years and you're no longer interested in doing so because of how much of a hassle it is, it is your right to stay home and say \"if you wanna see them, feel free to hop in the car and we'll be here.\" There's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. However, if they've been allowing you to stay with them when you travel to visit, you should either extend the same courtesy or pay for their hotel expenses. If y'all haven't been staying with them and paying for your own hotels/airbnbs, though, then it's agreeable to expect them to take care of themselves.  \n\n\nAlso, as much as I'm sure you don't want to hear it, saying \"they shouldn't be allowed access to their grandchildren because I don't like how they treat me\" is, in fact, weaponizing your children against your in-laws. Not everyone in the world is going to get along, including family, so if your children wish to see their grandparents, it incredibly inappropriate of you to refuse solely because you don't like them or they don't like you. The \"consequences\" of them treating you in a way that you don't like should be for you to call them out on it and/or refuse to entertain going out of your way to be around them as many times as it takes for them to learn the lesson and change, not punishing your children by denying them the opportunity to see their relatives as a power move.", "\nYou are NTA for not wanting to always haul yourself there (how old and frail are they though?) \n\nYou are NTA for wanting them to put in effort and treat you with respect. \n\nI think YTA for responding to passive aggressive with passive aggressive, and there is a double standard there if you say you deal with problems head on in your family, but aren\u2019t doing it with his. Why tell your husband and not them that you won\u2019t be traveling solo for holidays? Why say they aren\u2019t allowed to stay with you? These sound pretty passive aggressive to me. \n\nInstead, consider calling them to say, directly, how you are feeling. Say they are welcome to come visit you and their grandkids if they ate willing to make the effort, but you have not felt respected or appreciated by them and do not intend drive to them given that treatment.", "NTA- If they aren't making the effort to come 50% of the time when it's 100% easier for them to be the ones to come to you, then I wouldn't worry about it.", "Ding! Ding! Ding!\n\nUm the H should really revisit that logic.", "I never even thought of that. I'll look into it. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old.", "They are like 45. They don't want to drive because they have a 13 year old small dog and they say the drive stresses the dog out.", "I agree. OP is making seeing the kids as difficult as possible. I'm not saying OP deserves to be treated this way. I'm not even saying they aren't good reasons for your choices but let's not pretend you're not making them out of spite bc you definitely are, and that's weaponizing the kids.", "My kids were 3 and 5 (hadn\u2019t started kinder yet as she had just turned 5) we went and stayed for a bit. It was awesome. The flight is 18 hours and you have to pay for it yourself. But it is totally worth it. You can stay in country for 30 days on a visit without needing a visa or anything."]}
