You treat both families the same.   People who are respectful, kind and  a positive influence on your kids are allowed access to you and the kids.

It's absurd you're stuck in Texas by yourself.", "[deleted]", "Mostly NTA. At a certain point, it's perfectly reasonable to expect that the burden of travel for interaction should become a shared thing. If you've been doing it for five years and you're no longer interested in doing so because of how much of a hassle it is, it is your right to stay home and say \"if you wanna see them, feel free to hop in the car and we'll be here.\" There's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. However, if they've been allowing you to stay with them when you travel to visit, you should either extend the same courtesy or pay for their hotel expenses. If y'all haven't been staying with them and paying for your own hotels/airbnbs, though, then it's agreeable to expect them to take care of themselves.  \n\n\nAlso, as much as I'm sure you don't want to hear it, saying \"they shouldn't be allowed access to their grandchildren because I don't like how they treat me\" is, in fact, weaponizing your children against your in-laws. Not everyone in the world is going to get along, including family, so if your children wish to see their grandparents, it incredibly inappropriate of you to refuse solely because you don't like them or they don't like you. The \"consequences\" of them treating you in a way that you don't like should be for you to call them out on it and/or refuse to entertain going out of your way to be around them as many times as it takes for them to learn the lesson and change, not punishing your children by denying them the opportunity to see their relatives as a power move.", "\nYou are NTA for not wanting to always haul yourself there (how old and frail are they though?) \n\nYou are NTA for wanting them to put in effort and treat you with respect. \n\nI think YTA for responding to passive aggressive with passive aggressive, and there is a double standard there if you say you deal with problems head on in your family, but aren\u2019t doing it with his. Why tell your husband and not them that you won\u2019t be traveling solo for holidays? Why say they aren\u2019t allowed to stay with you? These sound pretty passive aggressive to me. \n\nInstead, consider calling them to say, directly, how you are feeling.

They are his parents hence his problem not yours.", "NTA- I hate it when people try to pull the \u201cweaponizing kids\u201d card when you\u2019re trying to maintain healthy boundaries.  You are not required to allow them to walk all over you because they\u2019re related to your children.", "NTA- since there is only 1 of you, it makes sense that they pitch in. Also you guys shouldnt always have to drive. However it is also sort of petty that you can't make just one drive fir your kids to see them.  Will your kids miss them? That's what I want to know.", "nta", "NTA.  Just drop the rope.  If they can\u2019t bother to contact you directly or visit, then it\u2019s a Them problem.  As for them not welcome in your home, if you don\u2019t have room, you don\u2019t have room.", "Nta", "NTA. \n\nIf the ILs won't respond back to you and use hubby to communicate instead, how are you even supposed to schedule visiting them with the kids after he deploys? You text them, they relpy to him, he may or may not be able to forward you their replies. Hubby makes no sense.", "NTA.  They don\u2019t even talk to you directly how the hell are you going to plan a trip out to them. Send them a text, they text your husband in Korea, who then texts you?  Or you could text and just hope for the best when you get there? \n\nAlso here\u2019s something if my 60+ yrs old parents can make an 14 hour flight  almost every year to visit me in Japan, your in-laws can do a four hour drive unless they have medical issues.  It is unfair to be the one that always carries the cost and responsibilities to visit.  Forgot the visits to them and save up the time and money you\u2019d spend on that and take the kids to your family.", "NTA. In a similar situation with my family. Our unit (meaning me, mum, dad and sister) were always the ones to go over to all of the extended family units houses for Christmas and stuff. Every. Single. Year. My mum got tired of being the only one putting in effort, so now we don't go over. And they still have never made the effort to come to us. \n\nIf they cared enough, they would", "NTA, stand your ground and stand it hard.\n\nYour husband sees you as the path of least resistance. He's not trying to talk sense into his parents because it's far easier to make you doubt yourself and guilt you into not rocking the boat. Make sure not to adhere to that expectation or you bending over backwards will be his preferred default solution before you know it (if it isn't already - depends on whether this is the first time you have to deal with that kind of bs from him.)\n\nRock that boat. Your back is not other peoples' playground and it shouldn't be you and solely you who loses. That is not what a compromise is.\n\nPut screenshots of his parents ignoring you in front of your husband and ask him point blank what he intends to do about this. If he says nothing, you're fully within your right to let him know that in that case you won't be doing anything related to taking the kids *anywhere* either. If the grandparents want to see the kids, they can either respect *both* parents or live with the consequences of their own actions. And most of all - his circus, his monkeys. If he wants this fixed, it's *his* to fix, not yours.\n\nAnd while I really hope your husband will get his reason (and respect for you) back, please always remember that a partner who throws you under the bus a lot is not a partner, it's an energy vampire.\n\n\nI think you might find some encouragement in reading this post - [Don't Rock the Boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/)", "NTA\n\nHe's not here, he doesn't have to deal with it, he doesn't have to make the drive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would suggest though, to try not to make your husband pick between his parents and you, as you may not win that one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn order to keep the peace, I think a healthy compromise would be to day trip it to a location halfway in between, and hang out for the afternoon so they can see the grandkids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they aren't able to make even that much effort, then they will have to wait until he is back. You could have the kids draw pictures and send them if you like, and do video conferences. It would be generous of you.", "NTA. Traveling is a lot of work. Traveling with kids and pets is even more work. Doing it solo would be hell. They\u2019re capable of coming to see you with a lot less effort. Why should you put in all the effort for people who are rude to you? Stay home, don\u2019t stress yourself out traveling with kids and pets. They can come to you if they want to see your kids. And they can make the arrangements with you if they want to visit, not your husband, as he won\u2019t even be there.", "NTA, they should abide by your rules and respect your decisions. Stand your ground!", "NTA. You're down an adult - long road with children and pets not worth the risk.  Tell him to set them up with zoom before he leaves and do virtual visits.\n\nAs for not being in house, well they've chosen not to have direct relationship with you. My partner's, parents did that but eventually they learnt if I'm not in the loop it is not happening. Not because I banned it, just because my partner has no retention of verbal agreements and won't practically organise it. And I'm  not minded to pull rabbits out of hats. Your partner's, parents are about to have same lesson. They need to co-ordinate with you as he's in a different country.", "Different family, different rules.  Also, even if your ILs weren't jerks, for you to transport kids and pets four hours to see them is just not doable with only one parent.  (OK it's doable but stressful.)", "NTA.\n\nIf they won't phone or text you, how are you supposed to get the invite to go see them?  \n\nFrankly, I think you are being more than reasonable.  Stick to your guns.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is gaslighting you, saying you are unfair in treating your and his family differently. You have no obligation to treat the families the same - one is your family and one is his. And you treat each family according to the way they treat you. Your husband should have had your back - he could have either demanded that his family treat you with consideration and respect as a condition of seeing their grandchildren, or let you off any duty to them, going by himself with or without the children. (That's what my husband did in a similar situation). But demanding that you maintain a relationship with people who make no effort to maintain a relationship with you, and on the contrary treat you badly, is not appropriate - this is not your job.", "NTA.\n\n4h is way too long to drive on your own with kids and pets. Not allowing them to stay is purely theoretical, as they've never came to visit.", "NTA\n\nWhile four hours is a long trip, their refusal to even speak to you isn't okay, and the fact that you had to haul children and pets while they just had themselves? Nope. If they want to see the kids, they can come to you.", "NTA", "NTA. Your in laws are clearly responsible for the situation.", "You're NTA. Your husband, and his parents are TA. You are not using your kids as weapons. You are allowing them to see the children, if they be adults and THEY make the effort. If they love their grandkids and want to see them, they will be mature, and put in the effort to see them. Expecting you, alone, to haul the kids hours away to see people who treat you like crap? Absolutely not. The fact that your husband is trying to blame you instead of setting his parents straight, is a BIG issue. There's no way he isn't aware his parents are immature A holes. Especially with them refusing to answer your questions, and instead texting him. Tell him to get a grip, be a man, and stand up for his wife.", "NTA a four hour drive is far too far to go and see unfriendly, unsupportive people.  Your in-laws can zoom call your kids instead.", "NTA. They have a choice, they can see their grandkids, they just have to make the effort. Don\u2019t put up with being disrespected. Hubby needs to have your back too xx", "NTA even if they weren't massive As. It's easier for them to travel without kids and pets.", "NTA. If they never made the effort, while he was here, and have stopped talking to you, wtf makes him think they will welcome you into their home? \n Enjoy your holidays, with your kids. If the ILs really want to see them, I'm sure they know where you live.", "NTA - his family never made an effort and refuse to communicate with you, treating you like garbage and not apart of the family.", "NTA. Military spouse here as well. The kids and I will be moving ahead of my husband (for medical reasons) and I won't be packing the kids up and driving the six hours to his parents once we get to our new house. I like my in-laws (except my SIL, LONG story) but it's so much easier for them to drive to me since they don't have two kids in the car with them. Plus I don't do distance driving well.\n\nI would refuse to put the effort into driving if they didn't talk to me. What happens if you break down in their town? They won't respond so where will you and the kids (plus pets) go if your car is out of commission? Not all ubers let you put pets in the car. What if you have an accident and suddenly need help because the pets can't go to the hospital with you? Or one of the kids doesn't need to go but the other does? These are just two examples of things that happen but your in-laws would be no help because they ignore you.", "NTA. Former military wife checking in. I know what it\u2019s like to be left to cope with my ex in laws on my own. My mil was the most dreadful woman I had ever met. But my ex wasn\u2019t married to her. He was my husband, and while she was his mother, a relationship I do appreciate, he and I were first beholden to each other. \n\nYour husband\u2019s obligation is to you, not his folks.

Never wished me a happy birthday. Nothing. I don\u2019t even have their phone numbers.

How are you even supposed to plan a visit if your ILs won't communicate with you?", "Nta. \n\nYou're effectively going to be a single parent with pets for the time your husband is away. It's not just as practical for you to make the trip. They on the other hand I assume don't have small kids so if they want to see the children they can make the trip.\nAnd understandable you would want them staying elsewhere if they do visit after making you feel like crap or not part of the family. \nIt's not your responsibility to ensure others have a relationship with your kids, it's their responsibility. Maybe agree to monthly video calls between them and the kids?", "Right? A four hour trip with kids and no spouse to see in-laws that don\u2019t treat you well.

NTA..... \n\nThat said, the above line stood out to me. OP says the inlaws are \"overly sensitive\" and they stopped communicating \"without reason\" - but I do wonder if that is truly the case.

They can come to you.", "I agree. I\u2019ve been there, done that. My in-laws treated me in a very similar manner for the first few years of my marriage. It took my husband awhile to realize how I was being treated. After he witnessed first hand the hostility, he went no contact with his parents for years. It was his decision. After some time his parents realized the error of their ways (and realized I wasn\u2019t going anywhere). Once they \u201caccepted\u201d me and were no longer rude, we all began rebuilding our relationships with healthy boundaries. They ended up having more respect for my husband & our relationship. I\u2019m thankful the relationships were mended. They both ended up dying of cancer and we were able to be there for them. They also got an opportunity to have a relationship with our daughter. \nI hope the husband realizes he can\u2019t allow his parents to treat his wife & mother of his children in such a disrespectful way. He needs to set these boundaries now.", "I agree with you wholeheartedly. OP\u2019s husband is a major problem!", "I don't understand why he's not addressing the fact that his parents will text him to reply to op.

No. No, no, no.", "That was my thought as well. With kids that young and her supportive family being that far away, I would be worried about emergencies. If something happens to her or one of those kids, she may not be able to play international phone tag.", "He clearly has attachment issues with his parents and cannot see them doing any wrong.

OP should pile kids and pets into a car, drive 4 hours, and show up unannounced so they'll talk to her when they cant bother to text back?
