As of right now she also has no interest in being a mom and I\u2019m in the process of getting the custody stuff figured out. \n\nThe lease to our apartment is up at the end of the month and I\u2019m not renewing. I\u2019ve already started the process of moving in with family for the time being until I can save up/find an affordable place. Well aparently my ex didn\u2019t realize that I meant it when I said I was moving out because she renewed her part of the lease. \n\nIt got threw to her earlier today when she got home at about 6am to find boxes in the living room and all the (in her words) ugly baby shit gone finally. Her first reaction was smiles and she asked me if the brats had died or my mother agreed to raise them for us. I will admit if my mom hadn\u2019t raised me so well I might have reacted differently. When I told her I was moving out because I wouldn\u2019t have our daughters grow up in this apartment which is unsafe (alcohol, some drugs, and a string of guys she brings home whenever she wants to) she threw a fit and asked how she is supposed to afford her life. \n\nI told her it wasn\u2019t my problem and started carrying boxes down. I will admit to blasting music on my headphones while she yelled after that because I didn\u2019t want to listen to it. Then I left. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve gotten calls from her mom and her friends. They are calling me heartless because she apparently is gonna be homeless within a few months and she\u2019s the mother of our daughters and despite all the stuff she\u2019s doing that should matter. \n\nI thought I was making the right choice but now I\u2019m not sure.

One thing I will say is it sounds like she's struggling. Obviously I don't know you or the relationship but trauma can make people act out of character. Honestly the constant partying and drugs makes it sound like she's trying to avoid processing the issues at hand (very young and sick children).\n\nObviously I may be totally wrong but if her attitude and actions have massively changed since having children I'd guess she needs some proper help. \n\nThat said absolutely NTA, you are putting those children first and that's the right thing to do. I wish you all the best!", "NTA, how is this even a question... Its bad enough she ignores her parental responsibilities and throws parties instead of caring for the kids. If everything written in this post is true, the decision seems to be between her lifestyle and the (quality of) life of your children, and the answer seems clear to me.

You understood the memo. She didn't.", ">she\u2019s the mother of our daughters\n\nWell she certainly doesn't seem to think so.  \n\n\nNTA. Good luck with everything - I wish you and your kids nothing but happiness and smooth sailing.", "NTA. Recommend al anon or similar to those contacting you. Tell her mom that your primary responsibility is to your kids, and that while you love (sober) GF she needs to figure out her own life. You told her you were moving out and she didn\u2019t use that info wisely. Also there\u2019s no reason she has to be homeless - she could presumably get a different roommate if she needs one.\n\nEx GF is the mother of your daughters but she is also an addict. You not only don\u2019t have a responsibility to keep enabling her, it\u2019s in your daughters\u2019 best interests for their mother to understand that her current lifestyle is not acceptable. A boundary stating that your daughters are not to be exposed to drugs, alcohol and unsafe sex is hardly controversial.\n\nYou are making the right choice.", "Plan on it.", "She hasn\u2019t even seen them since they were two weeks old. I had to start hiding their pictures because she started to just throw them out rip them up and one time set a fire in the kitchen sink. \n\nAs it is they are almost five months old now and so close to coming home. Just got to work on feeding now.", "She isn\u2019t even showing signs of really wanting custody. I just want things more official on that part so it doesn\u2019t create problems down the road. I\u2019ve heard horror stories of what can happen if it\u2019s not planned out. \n\nThat and I\u2019m hoping to create a stipulation where durring visitation if she has any she needs to be sober and clean.", "Unfortunately not a big change. She actually showed some change in the first two weeks after having them. That being showed an interest. \n\nThen she just stopped going to see them and started partying again.", "Yeah. DNA test confirmed.", "Unfortunately, if you are able to get the other parent's rights terminated, you cannot get child support. If it's just sole custody or conservatorship, that can come back to bite you because the other parent can always take you back to court and ask to modify the custody arrangement.", "I hope so. This journey has smoothed out (and I knocked on wood just now cause I am not jinxing this) but it\u2019s been a lot. Seven surgeries, three major illnesses, five transfusions, brain bleeds, heart murmur, and a lot of sleepless nights between the two of them. Baby B will probably need two more surgeries before she is 5. \nHowever both girls are doing good overall. The doc has told me that we just need to get them eating 100percent of their feeds. They are over 4lbs now and still on oxygen but it\u2019s expected that they will be going home on it.", "Good. I hope you have an awesome life with your girls.", "Dude, not excusing here at all, but that is not normal. And I\u2019d have to guess there\u2019s some kind of mental imbalance going on post birth. \n\nWas she like this before she gave birth? If so I don\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t just have terminated the pregnancy when she found out about it.", "She isn\u2019t showing she wants custody now. But she might fight for it just to hurt you. Make sure you cover all your bases. Ask for supervised visitation only for her.", "You should wear a voice activated recorder whenever you meet with her to get her actual words about the kids preserved.", "I'm really sorry your having to deal with this then. You've got this!", "I don\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t. I told her that i would support her no matter the decision and she chose to keep them. She still partied during the pregnancy and thankfully there isn\u2019t any major complications with them, as of right now, because of that. We fought a lot about that. \n\nShe ended up having them at just 24weeks along because she got into a car wreck. She was drunk. \n\nWhen she isn\u2019t partying and is sober she is a beautiful person to be around. That\u2019s the one I fell in love with. Sometime durring college she started to party. And at first I was too busy with schoolwork to really notice."]}
