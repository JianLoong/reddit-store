That's an outrageous thing to say. Sure, you lashed back at her in an unkind way, but I'm inclined to think she brought a bazooka to what wasn't even a knife fight - what did she expect?", "NTA - savage comeback, served as ordered.", "NTA\n\nYou met obnoxious with obnoxious. \n\nIf she can't take it, she shouldn't deal it out. \n\nI would go to HR to complain about her before she gets the chance to put her version in first.\n\nI've smelt a lot worse in staff toilets than that!", "NTA. She was waaaaaay out of line and asked for it", "NTA. Her point was to make you uncomfortable and you played the reverse card and made her uncomfortable right back. She got what she deserved, no harm done. Plus, you're on your period with cramps from hell and you still managed to keep your wits about you and come up with that zinger. I applaud you", "NTA.  I think she deserved worse.\n\nYou guys were in THE BATHROOM.  I wonder if she would have said something rude like that if someone pooped in there?  And what were you supposed to do, run around the office before entering THE BATHROOM announcing to everyone that you would be changing your menstrual \"equipment\" so they should avoid the area for a while?  Does she warn everyone when she's about to take a dump in there?", "NTA. Id definitely go complain to HR about that comment.", "Stinking up the bathroom with your monthly?

That is the point of the tradition of providing them.  Your comeback was brutal, but under the circumstances, you were clearly provoked.", "NTA\n\nThat was an awesome comeback to a nasty woman. Kudos to you", "NTA. what a witch.", "NTA. She sounds awful. Also, who walks into a restroom and expects it to smell like a florist or something? Of course there will be unpleasant smells there, it\u2019s a flipping toilet.", "**NTA!** I would have said far worse than that.\n\nAnd like, how exactly should you warn someone about the smell? Slap your used pad on the outside of the bathroom door? Or maybe draw out a picture of the female symbol with blood? Ffs, that woman is old enough to know that shit like she said won\u2019t be tolerated anymore by this generation of women.", "NTA, and great comeback! All women should know that at any given time when they walk into a public or workplace bathroom with multiple stalls that there's a 50% chance someone's going to be having her period. We spend upwards of 30-40 **years** having periods, so that sort of thing should never come as a surprise.", "NTA. I would have been gobsmacked if another woman said that to me and I would have outright just told her to fuck off", "Classic ESH. Her remark is super nasty but yours was just as mean. Others might disagree but idk. I find your reaction mean.", "NTA   \n\n\nI'm a 63 yr old crone, well past my expiry date. She was snarky to you. You had a better come-back. Not your problem if her feelings are hurt.   \n\n\nIf she complains, she might cite ageism. That works both ways.", "NTA. What you said was of course not a nice thing to say, but she started it while being wildly disrespectful.\n\nMost of us a mortified by the thought of inconveniencing other people with our bodily smells. Unfortunately, what can we do about them? As long as our hygiene is good, we cannot do anything more than that. We can\u2019t just stop bleeding. Should we announce to the whole office that we are on our periods? Of course not, that would be weird. That she is hypersensitive to that smell is her problem. \n\nI would beat her to it, and report *her* for her disrespectful comments and unreasonable demands.", "NTA - sick burn!", "Bathrooms are meant for natural body functions. She was in the wrong for what she said to you. #dontstartnonewontbenone", "NTA, if you're concerned with her complaing. Email HR now letting them know about the interaction so they can keep it on file.", "NTA - shame on that lady. How the fuck would a woman say that to another woman? I don't even understand how she would even begin to think that was appropriate or how she has zero empathy at all towards the situation. I have no idea what she expected you to do differently, you can't control your period with mindpower.", "NTA. She was extremely rude. You should complain before she does.", "NTA, and if she wants a warning, I vote for banging pot lids together and yelling it out through the office like a town crier.", "NTA \n\nAs an older woman you'd think she'd be more understanding of how periods work and how not to 'poke the bear' when someone is on their period, but I would definitely go to HR before her to make a complaint about what she said to you. \n\nI love your retort and I hope she thinks about this encounter in the future when she wants to open up her rude mouth.", "NTA go complain first", "She was unprofessional and should not have said that. However so were you. I would have made a formal complaint against her to Hr. I do think you shut her up though", "NTA what are you supposed to do put a sign on the bathroom door announcing that u are on your period? You can\u2019t do anything about it, it\u2019s beyond your humanly power. Yeah maybe you get a faint smell of blood but you also get a faint smell of garlic when your coworkers eat garlic bread on their lunch break.

She was rude first and had no right to comment on your bodily functions.", "I\u2019m sorry. I can get past that fantastic retort, past it\u2019s expiration date. That is possibly the best put you in your place response I\u2019ve ever heard!  However, not appropriate for work. So, a soft AH.", "Oh, snap!
