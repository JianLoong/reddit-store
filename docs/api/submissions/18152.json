It's not okay for OP to be penalized for creating less garbage. This sounds like a tenant's vs landlord issue, not other tenants against OP.", "Tell them to pay together for an extra bin if they want. NTA", "That's fair. I'm all for petty revenge.", "Or they can drive the extra to the recycling facility once a week . NTA. \n\nYou pay for your bin op with the utilities so they either reduce the waste or they find another solution", "You can pay extra for a weekly pickup. The neighbors need to do so if the 2weeks schedule doesn't work for them.\nThe 2weeks schedule is included in the utilities already.", "Probably because they would have to pay extra if they wanted a second one and it's cheaper to just bully the childless couple into unlocking their bin.", "I remember when they went from weekly to fortnightly collections to save money. It's so bad if you have kids in diapers. It gets really stinky.", "Or they could break down their boxes and put them in recycling. Nah, makes too much sense.", "Probably,  but that makes it a them problem.", "Doesn\u2019t your local authority offer a nappy collection service? I know mine in Hertfordshire used to. Can your neighbours not avail themselves of that?", "Yep, we\u2019re every three weeks too, but luckily recycling is weekly so it\u2019s all manageable. Where is used to live it was fortnightly alternating refuse and recycling and that was hard!", "This isn't a landlord issue. It's a council issue. I've lived in the UK. The council gives each tenant one bin regardless of family size and they've moved to biweekly pickup. It's a real issue for families with small children in diapers. \n\nIt's just not OP's problem to solve. It's not right to just take the neighbor's bin space and not leave them any.", "Sounds like they\u2019re trying to discourage disposables. \n\nI had twins, we used a mix of cloth and disposables, and our city changed garbage pickup to every other week when the kids were about a year old. City was explicit about expecting people to choose products that would generate less waste. It was rough, because their plans didn\u2019t account for households with multiple babies, or households with medical waste, or any of a number of scenarios that cause a household to generate more nonrecyclable, noncompostable waste. Even with our cloth diapers carrying most of the (ahem) load, our choices were to pay more for extra bags, or be buried in our children\u2019s effluvia.", "I did a mix also, but these kinds of policies wind up not considering things like access to laundry facilities, or the cost of washing them. There's no clear solution to the diaper problem.", "It\u2019s to do with the local council! They decide what sort of waste they collect and how from properties!", "once in a while I get a sticker telling me that my recycling bin has been checked and thanking me for only putting in approved items.", "NTA!\n\nThe audacityyy! I live in a residential neighborhood and it would be completely insane if my neighbors started to use any of my bins! (We have 3, 1 regular and 2 for recyclables)\n\nThe entitlement of these neighbors of yours", "NTA. I love that your landlord installed the lock, your neighbors are jerks.", "NTA\n\nAppropriately handled. Now they just need to do the same thing except maybe ask for a second one.\n\nTheir issues are not your problem not your responsibility.", "NTA I used to live in flats. I understand your bin drama. I assume you have to take the lock off on bin day otherwise how would it get emptied.", "Landlord is the asshole here for not providing enough bins. 1 bin forn2 whole weeks for a family of 4 (totally normal household size) doesn't sound great", "NTA. Their waste is their problem, regardless of how entitled they feel to use your bin.", "Tell them to talk to the landlord about more bins or more frequent pickup.  Two weeks is a long time for garbage to ripen.", "YTA. You are entitled to use your own bin.", "Nah, I had a very similar dispute at my previous apartment and I'm in the US.", "That\u2019s the one part i HATEDDDD about living in Philly.. they\u2019d try and fine us for some BS some other miscreant threw into our recycle bin as they lollygagged down the street.", "Upvoting specifically for use of miscreant and lollygagged.", "In many council areas up in Scotland (including the area I live in) bins get emptied every week, but on a three week cycle. So the general waste gets emptied one week, then glass/tins/plastic bin the next week, then paper/cardboard bin the following week. Having to wait three weeks for each bin to get emptied is a nightmare, they definitely aren't big enough to hold so much waste.", "Yeah, babies gonna poop. We were given months of diaper service as shower gifts, once we found out we were having not just an unplanned baby but actual twins, and we maintained that for about two years. Even so, we wound up having to wash a few loads when the kids ran through them too fast, and when they had tummy bugs we resorted to disposables. As they got bigger, we added more disposables because the cloth quantity we had coming couldn\u2019t keep up and our household cash flow couldn\u2019t handle prepaying a larger order."]}
