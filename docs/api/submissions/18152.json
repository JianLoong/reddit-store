They were great.  The even had air filters built is so you wouldn't smell anything.  I went from having trash 2-3 times a week, again I hated smells, to 1 every 2-3 weeks.

Either way it's not your problem.", "NTA, but check out your local council's website, because it may be possible for your neighbours to get larger bins (if the storage space at your flats allows). I know that a bunch of the houses on my street have larger green wheelie bins, and a few have smaller narrow ones.", "NTA Sounds like your neighbors should pool their money and pay for an extra bin to share. Either that or work to figure out how they can reduce the amount of waste their households produce (reduce, reuse, compost, recycle, switch to products with less packaging, etc). Either way, not your problem.\n\nItems being over-packaged as a marketing ploy really needs to be regulated more.", "NTA, they can request larger or additional bins for a fee from the council, it\u2019s not on you to accommodate their waste.", "NTA in this specific circumstance.

And the first Walmart bin.   \n\nThen I wrote my address on the second Walmart bin with a black sharpie.  It stayed.

So stressful living in the hood.", "Not necessarily a landlord issue.  Some people just produce massive amounts of garbage somehow, and often these are the same people that can't be bothered to either break down cardboard boxes, or at least fill them with garbage before sticking  them in the bin.
