Had similar problems finding space for my rubbish. You got permission to padlock it. They need to deal with their waste.", "NTA. you went through the appropriate channel and received permission to put the padlock. if they don't like it, that's their problem. they sure didn't care when you didn't have anywhere to put your waste.", "NTA.  Suggest to your neighbours that they pay for a larger bin.", "NTA at all also from the UK just ignore them, they need to request/pay for an extra bin as they make two bins worth of waste. Plenty of people where I live have done that because they have kids and make a lot more waste. They're just mad they're experiencing the issues you've had to put up with.", "NTA\n\nWe have a is 3-4 universal trash bins that get emptied weekly. \n\nThe problem is that not does maintenance uses them to clean out the apartments, we also noticed people from other places dumping their trash in there for free.\n\nIt gets so bad that no one can use them because it's full of construction stuff that's not from our apartment and other things. We found out that it was a bunch of families in the apartment that was telling their family to dump their stuff in our bins for free. \n\nIt took reporting the issue to get the people to stop. \n\nSo yeah, you're not their overflow because they're wasteful.", "NTA, and I'd tell them that their issue and perhaps a cloth diaper service with pickup and dropoff might be more of a solution for their issue.", "The most British AITA I've ever read. \n\nAnd, nah NTA. \n\nThe state/frequency of bin collection isn't your fault.

You pay to use the trash receptacle, and if they fill it with their rubbish, you can't. \n\nIf that means that they need to order another bin, that's what they should do; but they aren't entitled to fill yours, too, just because you aren't using it all.", "NTA. Your neighbor is an entitled crybaby. It isn't your problem that they don't have any place to put their used nappies.

Locks are great.", "NTA.  This is not your problem, it is the landlord's problem.  I just read in the comments that your neighbors can pay for an additional bin.

Incredible.", "YTA, if they're unassigned it isn't \"one per flat\", it's just they've decided the block needs this many bins based on tenant numbers and the 9 for 9 is probably coincidental. It's not your bin either so you probably aren't even allowed to padlock it. The landlord has already numbered them for your benefit, there's not much more you can do. Just take your rubbish out on the day it gets removed/day after so the bins aren't full and accept it's part of flat living.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Can't imagine having to hoard trash like that.", "Yeah, I\u2019m just glad my landlord let me make the changes to help the situation.

But it was also my job as the live-in/on-site janitor to manage all that mess. Shift the full ones to back, bring the empties forward, make sure everything fits and lids are closed at all times (for smells/hygiene and because my city wont pick em up if the lid doesnt close), and even packing any extra into industrial garbage bags, the only acceptable solution when your bins are full.\n\nNot exactly sure how all this works in OP's area, but part of this would be on the landlord over here.", "My UK flats just have a bin shed and it's all communal.", "It\u2019s even more frustrating because non of them utilise the space well.

I see your boxes not broken down and put in trash instead of recycling and raise you boxed shoved down and blocking the trash chute", "Also just using words like \"bins\" and \"nappies\".

Your bin is your bin not the overflow bin. Everyone else could chip in together to pay the council for overflow bins, or get their own second bins. You just (smartly) decided not to pop out any sprigs lmao", "Don\u2019t you have recycling bins? I bet they\u2019re just chucking in loads of stuff that either could be recycled or stuff they should really be taking to the tip if they\u2019re filling up this quickly."]}
