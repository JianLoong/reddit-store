{"id": 5548, "submission_id": "zuhsr1", "title": "AITA for bringing up my eating disorder in front of everybody when my job instituted a weight loss program?", "selftext": "I work at a corporate job in the US. It's got nothing to do with health or fitness.\n\nSince healthcare is through work in america, my job has this additional \"health\" program where if you meet with a dietician (company provided lol) who determines how much weight you need to lose to reach your ideal weight, and if you get there, you get a discount off your health insurance. \n\nI think that's kinda fucked up, as someone who's struggled with an eating disorder, I think weight is a terrible sole indicator of health. And TBH there was a good bit of money on the line. \n\nSo I bit the bullet and raised my hand to say \"My doctor is reccomending I gain weight and muscle mass as a part of my eating disorder recovery program. I hope I'm understanding this incentive right, in that anyone who achieves their wellness goals - regardless of whether that is a loss or gain of weight - is compensated? \n\nThe HR lady really awkwardly said that the program applies to weight loss, and hadn't considered \"exceptional cases\" but could address my concerns privately. \n\nI honestly got pretty irritated and said in front of everyone \"It's not 'exceptional' to want to gain weight, like most of the the people at my gym are trying to bulk up too. And they're all athletes who are fit as hell. So it's honestly kinda messed up that this program only applies to one half of \"fitness\" - a half that actively works against a lot of people's health goals' \n\nShe told me she'd follow up with me privately, that we were not talking about my \"sensitive\" medical issue at the all-hands, and that was supposed to happen yesterday but I got sick so I think it might be after the holidays instead. \n\nBut I'm mad. I feel like my job's overstepping dangling hundreds or thousands of dollars over everyone's heads to lose weight, like not even asking if losing weight is healthy or safe? \n\nBut I also started a lot of shit, my job's not really one where people speak up like that and I did, and I even made it pretty uncomfortable and confrontational in front of the company on purpose. \n\nAITA for what I said about my job's weight loss incentive program?\n\nEdit to address a common criticism - I do support programs that support and encourage health, I just think weight minimization isn't the best sole goal. \n\nWhen for the majority of people, stuff like cardiovascular fitness, endurance, strength, muscle mass, flexibility and wide range of motion, and core stability are likely better indicators of health and fitness. \n\nI would have loved a wellness program that took people's personal goals (whether that's weight loss, increased cardiovascular fitness and endurance, increased strength and musculature, advancing in your sport, working on balance and flexibility, finding small doable ways to be active in your daily life like taking walks or playing with your kids outside, etc) into account. \n\nAnd something that takes disabilities or existing health conditions into account, because honestly some general fitness stuff can be harmful if it's being pushed on a person who's not able to engage in it safely. \n\nBecause for what it's worth, even before I got deep into disordered eating, I was always fairly skinny. And skinny didn't mean healthy for me, even when I wasn't starving myself. I could hardly run a mile without being out of breath and I wasn't strong at all. But now, I'm in the best health of my life after I started lifting weights, rock climbing, and doing other activities that increase my cardiovascular fitness and strength. I didn't approach my current fitness from a perspective of weight, I've actually thrown out my scale. But I'm still the healthiest I've ever been.", "created_utc": 1671912959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuhsr1/aita_for_bringing_up_my_eating_disorder_in_front/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And dumb and anyone should be able to freely voice anything that matters but alas that is not how the work world works", "Agree. Lots of people are healthy and want to gain weight", "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm\n\nhttps://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-625-x/2019001/article/00005-eng.htm\n\n73% of Americans are overweight. 62% of Canadians are overweight. \n\nI suppose it depends on where you are, but this is one of the most common illnesses.", ">Did you miss the part where the employee has to meet with a dietician to discuss the amount of weight they should be at?\n\nDid you miss the bit where OP was told it was only for weight loss and that the comaony hadn't even considered cases where that may not be appropriate (which at best is tone deaf and shows how little thought was actually put into this). Or maybe the bit where there is an financial incentive to lose weight as quickly as possible rather than in a healthy sustainable way (which shows they don't actually give a shit about their staff being healthy at all and just want to do *something* to make themselves look good).", "I'd like it if the program left the option open for the dietitian to be like \"I think you'd be healthier if you put on 15 pounds of muscle this year\" \n\nOr \"I think it would be healthy for you to improve your cardiovascular fitness so you can run a mile without getting out of breath\"\n\nBut they framed it like Skinny=healthy\n\nWhen for the majority of people, stuff like cardiovascular fitness, endurance, strength, muscle mass, flexibility and wide range of motion, and core stability are likely better indicators of health and fitness. \n\nThose things can lead to weight loss in caes of people being over weight, and weight gain in cases of people lacking musculature, so I see health as going either way", "Oh I support programs that help people with their fitness goals\n \nI just disagree with the definition of fitness as skinniness. \n\nYou'd be shocked how many people have fitness goals other than the scale... Running a 5k? Learning to swim? Being able to do a pullup? Learning self-defense? \n\nMy personal goals at the moment are go be able to go up a few grades in rock climbing, put on 15 pounds of muscle, and do a tough mudder race in the coming summer \n\nLike at least in my social circle, people have fitness goals other than numbers on a scale, some of them lead to weight loss through excercise indirectly, but not a lot of people addressing their health in a safe way focus on the number on the scale.", "Offering a program to help smokers quit would be great. Offering that program and then giving discounted health insurance to people who take part would not be. Why should people trying to stop smoking pay less than those who didn't even smoke to start with?\n\nThe issue isn't the weight loss program. The issue is the discount being offered to those who lose weight.", "If they say that smokers who are quitting pay $500 and everyone who has never smoked pays $1000 then yes.", "I'm sorry, should I have said \"made up via assumptions\" instead of fake? Because I'm still not seeing any proof presented that this is actually the case. \n\nAnd an employer who will only reward one metric for \"fitness\" is indirectly penalizing those who can't meet that metric. Not to mention that my physical fitness is none of my employer's business unless and until it affects my ability to perform my job. Seeing as I walk upwards of 30 miles a week, I don't think that's likely to be the case.", "With love & respect in my heart...Fuck all that, be the change you want to see & speak all the way up in whatever tone you choose (because no-one's gonna save us!).\n\nEdit: forgot the NTA", "the point of an insurance incentive is to make people healthier, so they require less medical care long term.\n\nIf op were to lose weight, not only would that be terrible for them, but it could create costly healthcare needs like inpatient care in serious cases.\n\nThe program is assuming too much about people and encouraging unhealthy weight loss.\n\nMaybe try having educated opinions or even not having opinions on things you know nothing about?", "I asked for evidence about your claim that \u201cthe vast majority of people are recommended to lose weight by their physicians\u2026\u201d", "Edit: Thank you to everyone who helped me to look at things differently.\n\nI have removed my comment because I don\u2019t want to come across as insensitive.\n\nI admit that I was not thinking about this in the right way and I truly appreciate the different points of view on this.\n\nThanks so much everyone. I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and a relaxing holiday with your families. \ud83c\udf84\ud83d\udc9a", "I\u2019m really honestly proud of you for taking the step forward to help yourself this way. That\u2019s awesome, and that\u2019s something you should also be very proud of.\n\nI think you deserve many props for this.\n\nI just think it\u2019s dangerous to have incentives for people to promote weight gain because while it would definitely benefit someone who goes through what you\u2019ve dealt with, I\u2019m having trouble with trying to think of a way that this would be beneficial en masse.", "You\u2019re welcome to look it up. I\u2019m not invested in trying to prove something to you.  The OP doesn\u2019t have to participate if she doesn\u2019t want to. But she spoke up and made her concerns known and that should\u2019ve been the end of it. The rest should be in private.", "They can probably cite some different articles but if over 70% of Americans are overweight then it's just common sense to know that the number one recommendation that doctors have is to lose weight for your health.", "I mean, yes, i do think that. \n\nI actually think that lacking musculature / cardio fitness / flexibility / other important inficators of fitness, at the cost of a number on a scale, is a mass problem. \n\nI don't think the majority of people need to diet, I think the majority of people would be helped by living a more active lifestyle including cardio and strength training excercises", ">Would you say that being underweight is a mass problem in America in comparison to obesity that actually calls for a program that promotes significant weight gain? IMO this would cause people to try gain dangerous amounts of weight- to the point to where they could develop problems like obesity and other health issues\n\nI would say if programmes like this exist they should be on a case by case basis not just a blanket lose weight to save money basis. For many people, being underweight is a problem and conditions like anorexia are just as dangerous as obesity.\n\nYou say programmes to gain weight would cause people to gain dangerous amounts of weight. Surely the opposite is true here? Something that gives a financial incentive for losing weight is going to lead people to lose weight in an unhealthy way too.\n\nAlso, and maybe this is because I'm in the UK where generally employers stay out of this stuff, but what the fuck business does the employer have nosing into people's private medical situations anyway? Its none of their damn business.", "You don't think people in America could do to put on some muscle? \n\nI found muscle gain extremely helpful for my overall fitness and well-being\n\nAnd muscle gain = weight gain. Muscle is way denser than fat. Like sometimes when a bigger person starts weight training they'll get quite lean, but actually increase in weight, because muscle is so much denser than fat. \n\nSee here : https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iowaweightloss.com%2Fposts%2F5c29f73a53d04ee4bc904264570d977a%2Fimage%2Fembed&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iowaweightloss.com%2Fnews-and-events%2Fblog%2F2016%2F02%2F10%2Fa-pound-is-a-pound-the-difference-between-muscle-and-fat&tbnid=Ohu1LjVnZUTeFM&vet=12ahUKEwjdkfzGj5P8AhUvD1kFHbz8DloQMygBegUIARCPAg..i&docid=0MOXK-sDFsC7KM&w=280&h=300&q=how%20big%20is%20a%20pound%20of%20fat%20compared%20to%20a%20pound%20of%20muscle&ved=2ahUKEwjdkfzGj5P8AhUvD1kFHbz8DloQMygBegUIARCPAg", "Actually, you\u2019re right on that. Thanks for helping me look at it in a different perspective.\n\nI see what you\u2019re getting at now. And you\u2019re right. So I\u2019m deleting my vote because I feel that you have a better perspective on this.\n\nI\u2019ve changed my mind because what you\u2019re telling me makes much more sense.", "You all have great points and I agree. \n\nI was thinking of this in the worst perspective and that\u2019s my fault for assuming OP was trying to make this into something negative to try to push people to lose unhealthy amounts of weight and that\u2019s my fault.", "It\u2019s very refreshing to see somebody do this on Reddit.

That really means a lot.\n\nI love hearing different perspectives on things. That\u2019s what makes these posts so interesting. Having an open mind is important to me. I wish I could give you an award for this comment.\n\nYou\u2019re truly awesome! Thanks again! I very much appreciate your kind words.", "No, you are very right and you\u2019re most welcome.
