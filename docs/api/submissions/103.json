Have been getting into a lot of arguments here lately and I just want to know if I am in the wrong. \n\n!!EDIT!! I would just like to clarify why I say \u201cbasically dating\u201d because I\u2019ve received some backlash. We are both pretty romantically involved in this relationship, but still don\u2019t call each other our boyfriend/girlfriend. So that\u2019s why I said \u201cbasically dating\u201d also because that\u2019s the term we use for eachother. I had no idea this would cause an uproar in the comments but also would like to add that when I do talk to her I am very supportive of her mentally and I tell her she can tell me anything and I won\u2019t be mad at her and I want to help her not feel like she needs to smoke so much weed. I am very communicative that she doesn\u2019t have to hide anything from me ever and if something is bothering her that she can tell me if she is comfortable and i check on her daily. I am not trying to make myself sound like the good guy because I fully believe that I could be in the wrong, that\u2019s why I made this post but I just want to add that. I would also like to thank all of you for your positive comments that give me advice. \n\nBackstory: So she smokes weed, a lot of weed, which I wouldn\u2019t see a problem with if it wasn\u2019t messing up her and her life. She smokes wax pens and she goes through a whole cart in barely a week which is concerning considering the ones she used are widely known to be awful for you. \n\nAnyways I digress, I have mentioned multiple times over the past year that I am uncomfortable with her doing that because it is making her sick and she does it all throughout the day, including while she\u2019s supposed to be doing very important things that could damage her future / chance of having a good career. The only reason I ever say anything to her is because I care so much about her but she gets so super mad at me every time I bring it up and tells me that I\u2019m stuck up my dad\u2019s ass because I don\u2019t want to break rules and smoke and drink but truly that\u2019s just personally not what I want to do. She gets mad at everything I do and insults me constantly when I ask her not to smoke so much weed and I tell her that the reason I say something is because I love her and don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to her and she doesn\u2019t understand that. I truly care about her so much and if anything happened to her I would not recover easily but, I realize that I am still in love with a past version of her. I am still in love with the sweet, stable, loving, and caring version of her that I fell in love with years ago and that could be my problem but, am I the asshole for asking her not to smoke so much?\n\np.s. I try to confront her very nicely and with support and she still just blows it off and becomes such a different person. Also, when she smokes she just makes condescending jokes towards me and others and then gets sad when we call her out for it and get mad. She\u2019s very manipulative to me and I\u2019ve finally accepted that but still want to know if there\u2019s something I\u2019m doing wrong or could do better?", "created_utc": 1667277726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiyz5x/aita_please_let_me_know/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is clearly not a thing that she has any interest in changing, but you keep asking her to change it and say that it's ruining her life. That's not a good dynamic for a friendship/relationship/whatever.

This seems to be the case with your girlfriend.\n\nA person who does little besides smoke weed and vape, 24/7 is not emotionally or physically available for having a healthy relationship with a partner or even a good friend.  You could be waiting a lifetime for your friend to see the light, and she probably never will.\n\nYou really do deserve to have people in your life who treat you with the kindness and respect you afford to them.  I hope you don't waste anymore time on her, when she really doesn't seem to care about anyone but herself.

Right now she\u2019s avoiding dealing with her crap (to be clear, we all have crap), and she\u2019s avoiding something big and painful within herself that is causing those behaviors. \n\nWithout any negativity, you are not equipped to handle this on your own. She will likely need a life-changing event (aka the pucker-factor) to look herself in the mirror and start questioning her choices.

(Which isn\u2019t too often) when I bring it up I try to be as loving and supportive as possible while also trying to help her understand how this is harming her and her body.
