I know, because I didn't listen to mine.", "YWBTA if you text her, and for exactly the reason you state; you've \"worked hard to earn back \\[your parents'\\] trust.\n\nI am sorry that you miss her and her friendship.  But the two of you together made for a toxic friendship cocktail.  You need to stay away from her because history does repeat itself--it's just that the stakes get higher.", ">Lily and I both got caught and ended pointing fingers at each other\n\nand then...\n\n>she was a genuine friend despite everything\n\nBullshit. This is not friendship. Don't delude yourself. Doing shit you don't normally do can be exciting and fun for a moment, but ultimatley allowing yourself to be talked into shit that gets you into trouble, that's not healthy. No true friend would want to talk you into doing shit that causes you strife. She **is** a bad influence. And then she tried to blame you the second you got caught.\n\nAnd you returned the favor. Is that the kind of person you want to be?\n\nYWBTA.", "I'm having a hard time figuring out how she was a genuine friend ... a real friend would not want to get you into trouble like that.\n\nYou would be an AH for lying  .. and being friends with her would be stupid.  Get away from her and get some good friends that actually care about you.", "A lot of information is missing here. If the situation reached potential ramifications that your parents had to basically bail you out of, then perhaps you should reevaluate your friendship with the girl. If she genuinely cared about you then you would not have been in this situation in the first place. Listen to your parents, in this matter they know whats best for you and you YWBTA if you still reached out to Lily. Believe me, its better to be a loner than get in with the wrong crowd.", "YWBTA to both yourself and your parents. Your parents had to get you out of *legal* trouble because of Lily. Don't repay them by going back to being friendly with the person who did you wrong. She apologized. You forgave her. Let it be. You got closure. Don't give her an opportunity to hurt you again. It sounds like she was a bad influence to begin with anyway. I know it's difficult because you feel like you are alone, but don't be friendly with someone who doesn't deserve your friendship just because you don't believe you have anyone else. You said she was a genuine friend, but she wasn't. That's important for you to understand. She *wasn't* a genuine friend when it would have counted. She threw you to the wolves.", "If she was a genuine friend she wouldn't have tried to pin everything on you when you almost got in to legal trouble. In fact, she wouldn't be getting you in to trouble in the first place. I think you're confusing 'genuine friend' with 'person who gives me attention'.\n\nYWBTA. Your worked hard to earn your parent's trust back and will easily throw it all away despite this person showing you exactly who she is.", "YWBTA to yourself.  Lily is not your friend.  Your parents are right.  You don't want to ruin your life because of her.", "YTA.\n\nLily is not just the \"bad\" girl your mom doesn't approve of.  She's the legit bad girl with which you did things that got you arrested.  I know this is really hard to hear, but she's preying on you specifically because you are a \"loner in school.\" You are an easy target for her manipulation.  It is why she is coming back to you despite everything that went down. You WON'T get off with a slap on the wrist next time.", "i had my own Lily when i was in high school, and just like you i was always a loner\n\ni know I'm asking a lot of you but please trust me when i say she isn't a good friend - you almost got into *legal* trouble, i know it may be hard to see rn but it could have impacted your future forever if your parents hadn't helped you. Stay away from her for your own good in the long run, i know it sucks especially since you feel alone and as if you might have something wrong with you but trust me when i say the right people will come later in life and they'll be your ride or die", "YTA also if you\u2019re pointing fingers at each order you\u2019re not genuine friends. Get some therapy and then focus on finding real friends", "Lily sounds like an anchor - she will drag you down.  She may be fun but she is, as you already know, a black hole of trouble and if you go near you will be sucked back down into increasingly serious trouble.  This is a test of your ability to do what's good for you rather than what's fun - so, basically, a test of your ability to be a responsible adult.  Who doesnt get arrested and in legal trouble for going along with stupid highjinx. You already know the answer to this:  YWBTA if you reconnect with that vortex of bad decisions.", "YWBTA. You do not need a friend where the worst case scenario situation you wind up in is facing legal trouble. Do not contact this girl no matter how much you want to. You\u2019re missing the excitement she provided, and it\u2019s not worth it. Listen to your parents.", "YWBTA. She doesn't want a friend; she wants a partner in crime. RUN.", "YWBTA, gently and as understanding as I am about your loner plight. Your parents aren't just \"making up\" the whole \"bad influence\" thing, which tips the scales toward my judgement:\n\n1. *By your own admission*, hanging around with her isn't a great influence on you.\n\n2. When push came to shove, in order to avoid trouble, you threw each other under the bus. Is this good friend behavior?\n\n3. You are now in the position of lying to your parents. Sure, all teens do, but you should keep it to the bare minimum--making it a habit again isn't a good look. Every lie damages your relationship with the parents--especially after they got you out of a legal jam because of Lily. Is *this* worth it? Is *this* their reward for having your back?\n\n4. Even though you like Lily and she makes you feel good, you don't feel good about what you have to do to have her in your life. Again, good friends shouldn't cause this kind of conflict within you--should be the minimum of drama, yes?", "YWBTA, not just to your parents but to yourself. You deserve a better friend than that. Someone who is not going to use you for kicks and ignore what's best for you. Try to do what's best for you. And open yourself up to meeting someone better.", "You sound like you are not an adult and still live with your parents so yes YWBTA.  When you are an adult you can ruin your life if you want to, as a kid you have to go through your parents to do that.  There are other women, don't get hung up on one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

There must be somebody in your entire school that you have things in common with. Are there clubs you could join for activities that interest you?", "YWBTA", "Oh sweetie there are so many people out in this world. Why don't you look around and try to find someone else who is lonely that might like to be friends? There are more choices here than just obeying your mom and being lonely, or disobeying her and contacting Lily. \n\nYou know that Lily has not been a great friend, but there are many people that could be a really great friend to you if you gave them a chance. Look for clubs for things you are interested in, gaming communities, sports, hobby groups. You can find nice, like minded people. Good luck", "Yes YTA if you text. You are a kid doing stupid things with this girl. Your parents are trying to protect you from your own stupidity. Listen to them.", "YTA. You left a lot of details but you were slipping class and at the end of it both of you did something you are not supposed to do. Something so serious legal trouble was was a possibility and you won't even say what it is. She was severely punished and you, for some reason, were not.\n\nCount yourself lucky. Learn from your mistakes and don't contact Lily. Your parents won't always be able to save you and clearly whatever you did deserved real punishment.", "Gonna go with YWBTA as well.  \n\nYou have to ask yourself what made her feel like a \"genuinely good friend,\" because nothing you listed in your post indicates anything resembling a good friend.  Good friends have each others best interests at heart, which does not include sabotaging the good things in the friend's life.  \n\nYou self describe as a loner.  It's great to be so self aware!  Kudos to you!  You also sound level headed in your reasoning about everything else, which is great.  I know you feel attached to her because she offered a sense of companionship you maybe haven't gotten to experience with anyone else yet.  Companionship feels amazing!  \n\nBut in this case, it's also extremely dangerous for you.  You likely get more attached to her than others would because she's the *sole source* of companionship for you.  That means she can easily manipulate you into doing whatever she wants because of how attached you get to her.  And she's literally proven that that's exactly what she will do!  LPT: apologizing for doing it in the past is the first step toward manipulating you the next time.  She gets you to start to feel sympathetic toward her again, which makes you vulnerable again.\n\nTruly, my dude, she's not worth the trouble.  And truly, there are plenty of people out there with similar interests as you who would be amazing friends.  I know it's not an easy, and we're exiting territory where I can offer useful advice, but know that you're not alone in your plight or your interests!  \n\nYou've learned something about yourself: that you value and crave companionship (be it friendship, or a close relationship, or even a romantic relationship.) That's useful for you to know and understand!  Now you can take steps toward A) becoming more confident and happy with *yourself first*, then B) trying to meet new people.  By far the easiest way to make new friends initially is to bond over shared interests.  So think about some things you really like and then seek out some social opportunities around those things.  You like video games?  Know some kids who also like games?  Ask them what games they like and take it from there. \n\nGood luck!", "YWBTA if you reached out to Lilly.  Your only saying she was a friend because you admitted you are lonely.  She seems to be the only person showing interest and you crave that. Unfortunately, your loneliness led you down the wrong path and who is to say that you will not go down that hole again.  This time your parents may not be able to get you off so easily.", "I get that you're lonely but if you go back to her you're going to cause yourself a lot of trouble. It's easy for us to say not to. But just remember that we're probably much older than you, we've been there and done that and know what the potential outcomes will be and none of them seem very positive for you. Good luck", "You would be not just YTA but also a complete idiot.\n\nLily is not your friend.  She might be company but it's not worth it.\n\nYou will end up dead or locked up.  Listen to your mother."]}
