We'll call my dad's last name Smith and my mom's ex's name Jones (though the real name is quite unique). My mom gave me both names, hyphenated, so that I could partially match my siblings. She was self-conscious about having two baby daddies, essentially. \n\nAlthough officially hyphenated, my mom enrolled me in school only as Myname Jones. I rarely had to use the hyphenated name, so even I only referred to myself as Myname Jones. \n\nI didn't see this as weird as a child. I had the same name as my siblings, and we never saw each other as half siblings. I knew their dad was not my dad, but he was increasingly rarely in the picture, so it never really came up. I'm not sure when my siblings clued into that it was unusual. \n\nSo now as an adult, I got a job at an office where I had them put me only as Myname Jones, because that's how I've identified myself my whole life and I hated having to write out my hyphenated name. \n\nThe problem is that my siblings' uncle on their dad's side works there. Everyone assumes I'm his daughter, and the Joneses had no idea that my mom gave some other guys' kid their last name. Understandably, they were a little freaked out to discover this 20 years later. \n\nThey asked my brother to ask me to legally change my name, but I refused. I understand that it's weird for them, but this is how I've introduced myself for my entire life.\n\nI guess I could just go by Smith, but I just don't want to change the way I use my name. I like my name as is, and I like that I match my siblings. Would it even be an issue if it was a more common name? There are lots of people with the same last names who aren't actually related. \n\nI imagine I'll get married some day and change it anyways, but until then, I'm Myname Jones.

Your mother's name was Jones before she got married and when she had you, so in fact you could have been only Jones by law in some countries. But more importantly, this is your name. It doesn't affect that family in any way that you have it and honestly your mom did nothing wrong by registering you with the hyphenation. But how does your dad feel about using only the other family name?", "NTA\n\nFirst, your uncle has no business dictating what your name is. Period. And even if it somehow was, you\u2019re an adult. You can make your own choices regards to names.", "NTA.  It's your name; you can call yourself whatever you like. \n\nHad your siblings' dad been in their life this might not have been a surprise. Just say he's an ex-step-uncle (close enough) if people get nosey.", " NTA. Your name is your identity. I feel anyone asking you to change your name (including your future husband) is out to lunch. Names are important. If you love your name, keep it for life. Nobody has the right to ask you to change it. Just calmly give them a flat NO.", "Gonna say NTA cause its a name they don't own it and more importantly its your mothers surname,  which is why you have it.  \n\n\nThat being said kind of curious how your dad felt about this all these years, in essence either your name is either your mothers surname, which is how your dad likely views it or you inherited another mans surname which is how your siblings family are viewing it.  \n\n\nEither way your NTA your name is your name. Just kind of curious how your dad viewed it all these years.", "NTA for using a name you want.  You never have to change it - even after marriage if you don't want to", "NTA.  It is your mom's last name (or was) and it is the name you go by.  It doesn't freaking matter. The fact that they care is BIZARRE.  They should move on.  Yes, it is a little odd, of course, but it was your mom's last name when you were born.", "NTA - Your name at this point is your choice. If they don't like it, Too bad. If anyone asks just say you are unrelated. even uncommon last names can be found again occasionally.", "NTA.  I've worked with a ton of people who had the same last names. Did people think they were related at first? Sure, but then every one of them was quick to point out that they were not related. So, now it doesn't matter. So why should this matter honestly? You're not related to those people, and you'll tell other people that if they ask. It's that simple. You don't have to explain to anyone any more than that. If they choose to, that's their prerogative, but that would be counterproductive to their ask of having you change the last name.", "I have an uncommon last name and have run into people with the same one.  No relation.  So that part is irrelevant.  And they have no right to tell you to change it.\n\nSeparately, if you are in the States, my advice is to never, ever.  EVER.  change your last name. Its not just a run up to the courthouse and file a form.  It is the biggest pain in the ass.  I changed mine back to my maiden name after I got divorced.  3.5 years later, I am STILL running into issues.", "NTA. In act you can propose a better solution that will satisfy everyone involved. Tell them to change their names - this way:\n\n1. someone gets to change his name(even more people actually this time!)\n2. you won't have the same name as them which is exactly what they want\n3. you get to keep the name you're used to which is what you want\n4. WIN-WIN.", "NTA.  You're Myname Jones, everyone else can be Sitand Spin.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s a little odd that your mom gave you her ex\u2019s last name, but that\u2019s besides the point. No one has a right to ask you to change it. For all they know, you could have no association with them and have this last name out of pure coincidence.", "NTA. You get to choose your name and how it is presented", "NTA. It's your name. Use it. Who TF are they to demand you change your name? That's *crazy* entitled.", "NTA\n\nYou could call yourself 'myname santa claus' and it would still be nobodys business. If people want to think you are your siblings uncles child, then thats on them for assuming. \n\nBut them assuming does not make it your burden to change your last name. Your siblings Uncle could change HIS last name. It would be the same request, in principle.", "NTA because it\u2019s a name. They aren\u2019t the only people in the world with that name and if bothers them so much, just tell them that you have no relation to them.", "NTA. You're using the same last name as your mom and siblings. If anyone asks, you can truthfully say that you are no relation to your siblings' uncle, and he can say the same.", "NTA. You didn't play any role in the name you were given, and now that  you've lived with it, it is reasonable to continue using it. If you're asked about your relationship to your siblings' uncle, I think you could just say you're distantly related or that you're 'no relation' (the latter is probably more accurate). The fact that it's a unique name doesn't play a significant role here, for me, and you can just repeat \"Actually we're not related.\" as needed; it's no one's business where your name came from or the nature of your family's connection to your coworker.", "NTA. It is what you have been known as for your entire life plus it can be a hassle to change your name. They are asking a lot for something that will take of itself in time as people who know you and your uncle will figure out the relationship.", "NTA at all. You are the person you are. Those folks have no right to make you change that.", "Nta. Just because you happen to share a name with them because your mom wanted you to feel included in your family unit shouldn't matter. \n\nIt's like he's angry you have a red car because he has a red truck. It's a stupid thing to be angry over", "NTA\n\nAnyone can call themselves any name they like, as long as it's not for purposes of fraud. Families do not own dynastic rights to their surnames. You could be a fan of singer Englebert Humperdinck, and could change your name to Humperdinck if you like. People would think you were a bit odd, but it would be your choice.", "NTA. It should be YOUR decision and YOUR decision alone.", "Your parents never married?", "Yta, that last name was never for you to have. Also, so it's your mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mom ended up leaving him 4 years later, but probably would have years earlier if she'd been financially secure.\n\nI can't imagine my mom felt very loved by him after being rejected so many times.
