I'm not sure when my siblings clued into that it was unusual. \n\nSo now as an adult, I got a job at an office where I had them put me only as Myname Jones, because that's how I've identified myself my whole life and I hated having to write out my hyphenated name. \n\nThe problem is that my siblings' uncle on their dad's side works there.
