My sister(41) lost a child (not a miscarriage but the death of a preschooler and very suddenly). It's the most traumatic event that could ever happen to her. She'll never be the same. \nPeople keep saying \"I know how it feels, when Fido/Fluffy died a cried for a week straight.\" So many people say this to her. And many keep going on about it. \"This is what I did when Fido/Fluffy died to feel whole again\" or telling their dead animal story to her.\nI think this is the most offensive thing people can say. Well not the most offensive but just completely unaware. \n\nIMO when a pet dies, you mourn. You cry for days, your heart aches. However you pull yourself up and continue with life. You go to school or work. You continue loving and living. My sister may never pull herself back up. And certainly not after a week. We wonder if she'll ever be okay again. If she'll ever be able to go back to her career, go to the grocery store, get out of bed.\n\nI've asked people to stop paying their condolences this way. A few friends got very defensive with me about this and said I was being an AH because I don't understand how they feel. One says she's never had kids so she only knows how impossible it was to put down her cat she had for 16 years and it is the same thing she's going through. That the cat was her child. Another told me it's not my place to weigh others grief. All I know is that when they tell my sister this it makes her angry, very angry. A pet isn't a human being. \nI'm not really trying to offend or upset them though. But I guess I am weighing her grief over theirs. \nAITA?\n\nETA: Thanks everyone. Also wanted to add, I think people are trying to say: \"I've hurt too\" and this is acceptable. But, again jmo, saying \"I've been here when my pet died and\", Is where it gets sticky and offensive. I'm not trying to tell anyone their pet dying isn't traumatic, of course it is. But maybe in this situation just say how incredibly bad you feel rather than do a comparitive explanation.

This is a huge hot topic. \n\nIn my experience, when a loss is so huge, people try and offer companionship and sympathy by trying to be helpful to share their huge loss. I think it comes from a good place - of wanting to say \u201chey I had this huge loss and I got through it and one day you will too\u201d. \n\nThat said. It is not helpful. I learned this when I lost my brother. It was not helpful to hear about someone else\u2019s huge loss. I didn\u2019t want to hear about how other people had huge loss. It was helpful to have people sit quietly with me in my pain and loss and just be there. \n\nEveryone processes differently. I learned what I wanted. And now I offer that. Or I ask what would be most helpful IF the person can handle questions (which in most cases, no, they cannot). \n\nI am sending you and your family strength, love, peace and acceptance in this very, very difficult time I wish nobody ever had to experience.", "*\"...said I was being an AH because I don't understand how they feel\"*\n\nSo - do these people realize this has nothing to do with how they feel?   \n\nNTA.    This is just insensitive, it doesn't sound very friend like at all.   I love my pets but they aren't people.   Even if I thought they were, it would take a total lack of empathy to respond to a grieving parent this way.   \n\nMy heart goes out to your sister - and your whole family.    I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I am childfree and love my pets more than words, but equating losing an animal you obtained knowing you would outlive to a human child you expected would outlive you is just unimaginably cruel.", "NTA. IMO, people that do this are trying to make everything about them. You're allowed to mourn and miss a pet. Do NOT compare your animal to a person's actual child.", "NTA. My son died when he was 6 months. \n\nI EXPECT my cats to die before I do, if they don't then something has gone very wrong and I have died very young. \nI don't expect my child to die before I do. \n\nI miss my childhood cat. She was called Delilah. She died when she was 17, so a very old cat. But missing her isn't painful, just sad. \n\nWhen I think of my son, I experience a deep physical ache and pain, there is an emptiness that will never be filled. \n\nWhen people ask me \"how many cats do you have?\", I say \"2\" as I have 2 cats living at home. \n\nWhen people ask me \"how many children do you have?\"...I never know whether to answer 2 or 3. I often say \"I've had 3 but I've got 2\". \n\nNTA. No point those people trying to say \"well it's the closest I have to understanding\"...you don't have to go through the exact same thing in order to have empathy and be there for a person. It's not a competition. Arseholes.", "NTA.\n\nSame to the people that say \"God has a plan\" or \"Everything happens for a reason\".", "NTA. I\u2019ve never considered putting down a kid. \n\nThe appropriate response to a persons grief is to listen. It is not the time to make it about yourself by talking about Fluffy.", "NTA\nWhen you get a pet, you know the likelihood is it will die before you. No one has a child with that expectation.", "You are showing love to your sister in the best way at this horrible time.   You are protecting her.   NTA.  You are the best sister a person would ever ask for.\nETA NTA.", "The only way it is appropriate to do what they\u2019re trying and failing to do is to say the opposite.

I love my dogs a lot and I was devastated when I lost my first dog earlier this year, but it is NOT the same as losing a human child and people should know better than to make that comparison.", "NTA - so many people are so bad at condolences, here are the rules:\n\nDon\u2019t start any sentence with \u201cat least\u201d! Never say \u201cat least they had a good life\u201d, \u201cat least you can have more children\u201d, it\u2019s all terrible and not compassionate. \n\nDon\u2019t tell someone you know how they feel, and don\u2019t start taking about your own loss. \n\nDon\u2019t say anything about it all being God\u2019s plan or they are in a better place now. \n\nDon\u2019t say \u201clet me okay is if you need anything\u201d, instead offer something specific like \u201cI\u2019d like to bring you dinner on Tuesday\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d like to volunteer to walk your dog every afternoon this week\u201d, something specific that doesn\u2019t put it on them to come up with how you can help. \n\nA very good book on this subject is There\u2019s No Good Card For This. I wish we were all better educated on what to say to each other in tough situations. \n\nJust say things like, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m here for you\u201d, \u201cI\u2019d like to bring you dinner on Tuesday\u201d", "Rule number one when someone is grieving: Never, never say \"I know how you feel.\"\n\nIt is incredibly inappropriate and hurtful to compare your loss with someone's current loss. Even in the instance where two people have both lost a child, you shouldn't compare their losses.\n\nPets can be very important to people, but they aren't human children. It's not the same.\n\nSo upset on behalf of your sister. So sorry for her loss. I cannot imagine the incredible pain she is going through right now.\n\nETA judgment: NTA", "\nNTA \n\nI just lost a co-worker and a grandparent this week and I feel weird talking about it to one of my best friends because she lost her _father_ a month ago and that feels so much worse than a grandparent or co-worker. \n\nComparing a pet to a child is absolutely obscene and will not be received well. When I took seminars on grief\ngrief for a job in Hospice, we were explicitly told never to compare the loss of a loved one to the loss of a pet.", "NTA. saying you know how it feels and then comparing a child to a pet is a bit tone deaf. \n\nLosing a child is very different from losing a pet. Just as losing a parent is different from losing an aunt or uncle. I hated it when I lost my dad when people said I know your grief  my grandpa died at 99. No No you don't your dad didn't die. He's still alive. \n\nThe only people who understand the grief of losing a child are those who lost a child. \n\nYou can offer your thoughts without needing to say you understand their grief.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nWhen I was a young teen my mom died. I had people pull the same thing- classmates I didn\u2019t know would come up and say how their pet died and it was hard, they know how I\u2019m feeling. \n It felt awful and minimizing.\n\nI think, at the root of it, most people are coming from a place of good. Death makes people uncomfortable (most times), and people tell these stories to show empathy, and show they can feel those feelings of loss and know how it hurts, to make the one mourning feel less alone. \nSometimes people get blinded by their need to prove they understand the exact pain. So then their attempt at empathy is just self serving. People in mourning don\u2019t need that- they need compassion. \n\nAgain I\u2019m so sorry for the hurt your family is going through. You\u2019re a great sister for stepping in and telling these people to cut the crap.", "Nta. And that's super offensive to compare the death of a child to a pet, particularly a pet that died of old age. Gross. It's not comparable. It's not measuring grief. A pet WILL die before you. A child is supposed to die after you. And tell them it's insensitive, it doesn't matter if they understand it's offensive, but it is. I would literally punch a person who tried to compare them if I were in your sister's shoes. (I'm not. But I'd be tempted to punch them for your sister if I overheard that and I don't know her \ud83d\ude06)..", "NTA - im sorry for your loss.", "NTA,\nAlso OP, it may be impossible to see it right now but your sister will get through it slowly. I've watched my mom go through the same thing. It took her almost 15 years to get back to her old self. First few years were that hardest but each year after that she got better. I do realize that people grieve differently but with support of the family she'll be able to heal over time. Not sure if your family is religious, but know that you have a stranger that's praying for your sister in this difficult time.", "NTA. \n\n*They* are the ones doing it:\n>Another told me it's not my place to weigh others grief.\n\nAnd it makes your sister mad, just tell them they have no right to weigh her grief, so they need to respect she doesn't want to hear about a pet. \n\nWhen my father died, several people told me that he did this or that for them. I know now that they were trying to make me feel better by saying he was a good man, but at the time i felt mad, like they were trying to say they would miss him as much as me because of something he did once before, so I shouldn't be that sad.\n\nSometimes the delivery is not suited for the person at that time. Ask them to give your sister some space and time by not comparing with a pet, say she is in no condition to understand, and she feels it downplays her pain. If they care for her, they will understand, or at least respect.", "NTA, while their grief over pets is valid and they\u2019re probably just trying to help, it\u2019s not a good way to empathize at all", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry about the loss of your sister\u2019s child, I can\u2019t even imagine the pain for all of you. You\u2019re being a great sister trying to shield her from these cruel comments. It\u2019s mind blowing to me that people would say that. I understand for some people that\u2019s the greatest pain they\u2019ve known and that\u2019s ok, but most people would still realise losing a child would hurt more and keep their mouths shut. And the fact that they\u2019re getting defensive when you\u2019re saying how much it\u2019s hurting your sister is just so gross\u2026it\u2019s making it about their pain and loss instead of hers. I\u2019m so, so sorry. You\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA\n\nEven putting aside the human/animal comparisons, you are supposed to outlive your pets. That\u2019s an expected part of pet ownership. You are not supposed to outlive your children.", "Nta. I have lost a pet that I loved dearly. But in no shape or form can it be compared to the loss of a child.", "NTA I lost my brother in 2013, and to this day, I remember his birthday and go. I might be this age, but he's this age. It hurts pets dying does as well, but not as much. I'm sorry, very sorry for her loss. Mom and I slept on the live seat for two weeks after he passed. It will hurt just to warn you when you least expect it.", "NTA - I absolutely hate it when people compare their loss to yours. Also how they managed their mourning.\n\nI had this a lot when I lost my mum. I had people go on and on about their losses and how they dealt with it than actually asking how I was. During that time (and still to this day) I don't want to talk about it as that is how I deal with it. \n\nEveryone mourns in different ways. And I totally agree with you, a pet is part of the family however they do not compare to losing a child.", "NTA. At all. My sister's newborn passed away suddenly, and you're absolutely right, it is not an equal comparison. Those people are trying to make her tragedy about them and it's shameful.\n\nYou are her protector right now, when she is too wounded to protect herself. I had that role too. Be absolutely fierce.\n\nMy nephew would have been 26 this year and my sister has never been the same either. She is better now, but not the same. Much love to you and your family.", "NTA. I adore my pets, but no, a pets death does not compare to a humans.\n\nPeople know the life expectancy of cats and dogs. We know they won\u2019t outlive us. \n\nHaving a child that literally grew below your heart, that was a piece if you, die, to me is the most agonizing grief a human can experience. You have so many hopes and dreams for a child. Their death is the end of that. All the things that will never be, come crashing down on you.\n\nYou are right, your sister will never be the same. She will never get past this. She will hopefully learn how to live with it. I hope she has the love and support she needs to be able to do that.\n\nPeople often feed awkward when someone dies. They don\u2019t know what to say. Saying Fido dying makes you understand is a stupid thing to say to a grieving parent.", "I used to feel as you do.  I actually lost a child. He was two months old. Natural causes. I used to get highly offended when I saw people comparing humans to animals. This was completely irrespective of the loss of my child and I probably always felt this way even before he died or even before he was born.  I don\u2019t recall anyone ever comparing a loss of a pet to my own personal loss. Just giving some background.\n\nOnly through my time on this specific board have I come to see animals as far closer to humans than what I previously believed. They have many of the same emotions that we do. And people do value their animals almost as much as they would value their own children. I used to marvel at people going into burning homes for their pets. Now I completely understand, despite never having owned a pet. \n\nUltimately, I\u2019m going to say that they don\u2019t compare. Like you said, losing a child leaves a hole in your soul. Pardon the rhyme. In my own case, I\u2019m pretty much over it. I don\u2019t get sad that often; maybe once in a blue moon and only for a fleeting moment. It\u2019s been almost 12 years. He has a surviving twin brother.\n\nWith that being said, I\u2019m going to say NAH for the comments, but NTA for the reactions.  Once you have shared with people that their comparisons are not appreciated, they need to do the gracious thing and apologize and move on, not get defensive. \n\nPlease, no condolences.", "NTA. Even on a basic level you simply don\u2019t compare traumas. But with children\u2026.every person knows their pet will die before them. It\u2019s sad, but you\u2019re prepared that it WILL happen eventually. \n\nA child? No. Not the same, sorry.", "NTA. When you get a pet it is expected you will outlive them. This should hopefully never be the case with a child. They are nowhere near equivalent. \n\nThis is coming from a veterinarian with children.", "NTA\n\nThese people need to be told. It's not okay, it's unbelievably tone deaf, ignorant and cruel. I watched my parents go through the loss of my sister, their daughter. It took a decade for my mother to even *start* being okay again. There is no comparison with the death of a pet. None. Fight me.", "nta. you are looking out for your sister going through something terrible that will never be okay. \n\nI'm inclined to say nah as well. I really dont think these people intend to undermine her loss. i think their attempt to empathize with pet death is misguided but not malicious. people love their pets deeply as well. but you are right it isn't helpful as a comparison. sometimes people don't know what to say in really tragic situations like this. I can't really think of something helpful or comforting to say to someone who lost their child, myself. I can't imagine.\n\nyou are not wrong to tell them to drop that comparison though.", "NTA. You\u2019re a wonderful sister for being protective of your sister. \nI\u2019m so sorry she and your whole family are going through such a devastating loss. \nNothing anyone can say can ease the pain your sister is feeling. But to just be there and let her know that if she wants to talk that they\u2019re happy to listen. \nI will be sending prayers.", "NTA\n\nPersonally I agree, pets cannot be compared to children unless you really never ever wanted children and never will. But even then, it still cannot be compared. Many cases, these children are within us for 9 months, then we care for them as babies, and continue to help them navigate the world and grow their skills. For a parent who truly loves their child, this is a bond that is, in my opinion, much stronger than that one could have with a pet.\n\nSo to lose the actual light of your life, the very thing that made you looking forward to wake up every day, keep working, and come home? The one that brought not only happiness to you but to family and others around them? Yeah, thats something you never, ever get over.", "To me, NTA.

You aren't weighing her grief over theirs by being considerate of her feelings.", "NTA. I love my pets like crazy and mourn hard when they die but I'd never compare that to the life shattering event that is losing a child. I get people are trying to show they empathize but this is not the way to do it.", "NTA. I definitely agree no one should be pitching in with stories of losing their pet to anyone who lost a child.\n\nNow, I\u2019m childfree and a dog mom. Not a pet owner. I lost my beloved dog last year, and I actually cancelled a work contract and lived off savings so I could spend his final weeks at his side. I was very fortunate be able to do this. I cried constantly for days. And every day for months at the mere thought of him. It is not something I was over in a week. Yes I had to go back to work a few weeks later, and I managed to do that. But I just want people to understand when you have an especially close relationship with a pet, their loss is not something you get over in a few days or a week.", "NTA, it is definitely not the same", "NTA\n\nI had my dog for 13 years. Got her when I was a toddler and she slept in my same room. She was around for really dark times in my life. I was devastated when she passed. I still think of how excited she would be when I got a new place. How much she'd like my husband. Etc.\n\nThat being said, it is *not* the same as losing a child. They are false equivalences. If I were to lose my nephew, that would be such a different kind of grief. Nevermind if it was my own child. Children are supposed to outlive adults. You imagine how they grow, what they'll do, the places they go. You mourn the people they never got the chance to become. It doesnt need to be a competition of which is worse, and I can accept an idea that grief is subjective. But it is not *comparable*. \n\nTelling a mother who lost her young child that *you* understand because you lost something that *wasn't* your young child? Its messed up. People who lost pets dont understand. And thats okay. Its different.

Yes, losing them is the closest I will ever come to losing a child, but it absolutely does not compare.

Most deaths that we experience are expected, and many times our first brushes with death are extended family members, not the nuclear family. Many people\u2019s first brush with that \u201clevel\u201d of grief is their pets. \n\nHumans are social creatures who bond and give comfort with empathy. But how do you bond over something most of us haven\u2019t experienced yet? And most of us hope to never experience something as traumatic as the death of a child. \n\nSo we short circuit and try to find anything with grief. And try to use that as the basis of empathy. \n\nI truly don\u2019t believe it\u2019s people making it about them. Most people just don\u2019t understand how to use empathy vs sympathy, and then they say something stupid about their dog. \n\nDoes it make it right? No. And OP and OP\u2019s sister shouldn\u2019t have to explain it. \n\nThe solution to this is when comforting someone, take the phrase \u201cI know how you feel\u201d out of your vocabulary unless the person is asking to hear about shared experiences. Chances are, you don\u2019t know how they feel. \n\nNote: This is all a personal theory from my experiences.", "And DO NOT judge my grief for my pet.

I've suffered loss and I take comfort in people with comparable stories. There's an unseen connection between people that \"know how you feel\" vs those who have no idea.

We take them into our lives and our hearts expecting that we will stay with them until death, and probably get another one after. That is a natural cycle of life.\n\nEvery parent has a reasonable expectation that their child will outlive them. No parent is prepared to lose a child in their lifetime. Some can make peace with an inevitable situation if given time to process in advance. Nobody can ever prepare for the sudden death of their very young child.\n\nOutliving one's child is **not** a natural cycle of life.\n\nI sympathize with your connection to your pets.
