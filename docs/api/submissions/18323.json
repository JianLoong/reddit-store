I\u2019d tell my best friend.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. He deserves to know he has a child and to support said child. Kids need their parents in their lives and this puts that in jeopardy. I personally feel likes she hiding something and thats why she doesn\u2019t want to tell him. Causes issues down the line. I would still give her the chance to do it but eventually someone has to.", "NTA and you're doing BOTH of them a favor because if he moves and finds out she hid a kid from him, and then he challenges for custody, a court is going to look POORLY on her for intentionally hiding it.\n\nSo here's how it can hurt her: If two separated parents are coparenting a kid, and one parent moves, generally that parent is going to be responsible for the costs of travel and what not for them to be able to continue coparenting.\n\nHowever, if the coparenting BEGINS after one parent relocated after having not known about the kid, a court can decide both parents will be equally responsible for travel costs.\n\nThese are just generalizations and there are a million little nuances including the percent of custody each parent has, etc. But seriously she might not be doing herself a favor by trying to hide this kid.\n\nI think what you should really do is post about this situation in r/legaladvice and show your friend.", "NTA.  If it is truly his kid, he has every right to know and decide what he wants to do going forward.", "INFO: did you go straight to the ultimatum like you wrote it? \n\nThat would make you the A H to me. Your friend is just single, just found out she is pregnant and is clearly processing. Pretty shitty situation to be in. She may be afraid of messing up his life, maybe that he will be angry, maybe that he will try to get back with her after breaking her trust now that there is a baby etc. \n\nMark has a right to know, 100%, no doubt about it. But does he have the right to know instantly? In many happy couples the woman may take some time to plan a fun announcement, would that be messing with the father's rights? \n\nIt could have been a shocked conversation without an ultimatum there should have been a supportive encouraging conversation, if needed backed up by legal info about her rights and her childs rights in your state, if needed followed by a pressing conversation, and only then whip out the threats. Basically, why choose the brutal option while the kind option is right in front of you in dealing with your long term friend.", "NTA. It's not okay for her to keep that information from him.", "NTA. Even more than Mark deserving to know (which he does), his child deserves the chance to have their father in their life in some way.", " Nta. Will this mess up his life? Probably. But he has the right to know.", "NTA if her plan is to keep the child or put the child up for adoption. \n\nMark has a legal right to know he has a child if the baby will be put up for adoption. If she chooses not to tell him, then gives up the baby, that puts the baby's placement in jeopardy later as Mark never gave up his parental rights.\n\nIf she is going to keep the baby (which I think you said was her plan), then Mark also has legal rights to the child. If he were to find out he has a child and she never told him, he could sue her for custody / visitation. It could go very badly. At the very least, they will need to co-parents together because again, he has legal rights unless he chooses to sign them away. The sooner they begin to work out how they will co-parent together, the better. The less bitterness there is between them when they begin to do that, the better. \n\nThe only situation in which you might be the asshole is if she were considering ending the pregnancy, and even then, that's a very tricky situation.", "Looks like OP already knows the answer\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s OPs right to tell mark, But I think it is Jennifer\u2019s duty to tell mark, he has a right to know.\n\nIt\u2019s only gonna make things awkward and raise more questions once the child is born if everyone\u2019s still all friendly with each other. \n\nBetter off being open and honest up front from the start", "NTA\n\nYour friend needs to know that he's becoming a father.

Regret is for what you Don't do.", "Unpopular, but I think YTA - is she never planning on telling him or is she just coming to terms with the pregnancy? I think it\u2019s a bit much for your first reaction to this to be an ultimatum. Mark should know, but it isn\u2019t really your place to tell him.", "Jesus Christ on a bike NTA I hate women who refuse to tell a man they are pregnant with their child (with the exception of abusers and rapists).  \n\nMark has the right to choose where he wants to be an active parent in the child's life or only contribute financially.  It's not here decision to make and by not telling him she's making it for him, which isn't fair to Mark or the child.", "Its a NTA from me.\n\nIf she didn't want mark to know she should not be telling people who knows him that it is his baby. \n\nI know a lot of guys who would be devastated if they found out they had a kid and didn't have the chance to be a part of that kids life. \nIts not a bad reason, not wanting to disrupt his life but again if she worries he might want to move back it seems like she knows he wants to be in the kids life, ultimately deciding for him that he cannot. \n\nAnd how would mark feel about you if you knew and didn't say anything? \n\nYes it is her body and her pregnancy, but it is marks child as well. But she is probably in a tough spot right now, could you talk to her and explain that Mark is one of your best friends and keeping something like that from him is too much and you would prefer it if she told him, but you couldn't imagine keeping a secret like that.", "NTA. Jennifer is a major one though for keeping a baby a secret from their father.", "NTA - Tell Mark quickly so he can make sure he is legally protected in his rights and obligations to his own child.

In extraordinary circumstances, I can understand keeping it a secret, but nothing that you have suggested would indicate that extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary situations and choices\n\nAlso. NTA.\n\nEdited for the judgment", "She hasn't given birth yet. A miscarriage may happen at any time. Don't stress her out, or you could be putting her and the baby in danger. \n\nHas Mark ever bothered to call her? If he went NC after ditching her for a job he's not exactly interested in what could have resulted. Remember, HE left HER.\n\nPregnancy is her medical info, you are correct. She also apparently did not tell you. So no you should not say anything. You are no one to her, and trying to play God with her life by giving her an ultimatum is complete abusive asshole territory.\n\nAt the absolute most, the next time you talk to him just ask if he still talks to her or if he's seeing anyone. That is all.\n\nYTA \n\nRemember, at the moment, there is no child, and Jennifer has a medical condition she didn't tell you about. If once there is a child, and she tells YOU, talk to her about it. \n\nWhile I may think it would probably be a good idea for her to tell him, I'm not her. You are not her. None of us know what actually happened in their relationship. A lot of stuff happens behind closed doors that people might not want to believe. Maybe he told her he doesn't want kids, or would not want to know. WE don't know.", "Guy code clearly states that everything a guy does, this includes procreation, is his responsibility.  \n\nSometimes, women get in their own way.  She's not thinking clearly, in my opinion.  Guys, get in their own way a lot more mind you.  \n\nYou should give her a chance to let the friend know.  Explain that oddly enough two people are actually getting pregnant and both are responsible for doing the right thing.  What happens 20 years from now and the little one now a big one wants to reach out to daddy.  Surprise!  Not good.", "NTA: \nSomeone mentioned she might be waiting for the first trimester to tell him then why  didn\u2019t  she wait to tell you & your wife? Tell him!! \nWhen he finally finds out and then happens to find out you knew\u2026.. kiss that friendship goodbye.", "I'm hesitating to flat out say you're TA, because assuming there are no extenuating circumstances, Mark should definitely know. It's really, really not your news to tell though and giving Jennifer an ultimatum was shitty. \n\nI guess it's an ESH for me.", "NAH. I understand your concern but right now there isn\u2019t a baby, there\u2019s a medical condition that could end a lot of different ways and the person who is pregnant has the right to privacy and choice in who is supporting her through this stage. She told your wife because she\u2019s her friend and not you, or everyone else, that it\u2019s Marks baby. It\u2019s not clear she\u2019s telling everyone else that part. It\u2019s likely to get back to Mark eventually either way that she\u2019s pregnant when she starts to show. She could miscarry or have a stillbirth or choose to terminate before that. So she may be waiting for this to get more real before she discloses to him. You don\u2019t need to share your wife\u2019s friends confidential medical information with her ex just yet.  You also can\u2019t be sure who this guy is in a relationship. You know him as a friend, not a romantic partner. She may have decided not to tell him because he\u2019s controlling or emotionally abusive and she doesn\u2019t want to deal with that along with an unplanned pregnancy. She might be concerned he will believe she baby trapped him to force his return. \nIf this pregnancy ends with a child being born, then Mark does need to know. Unless he\u2019s actively dangerous, which it doesn\u2019t sound like is the case. If she\u2019s still planning to withhold the information then I think you have a totally different dilemma on your hands because the ethics question changes. And you would tell Jennifer you are going to tell Mark the truth if she doesn\u2019t so she has the opportunity to do so. I think she\u2019s going to resolve this on her own before hand because most people who start here are just panicking.", "NTA", "NTA - he deserves to know, and not telling him is just as damning. She's robbing both him and this child of a relationship over an assumption.", "Info: is Jennifer definitely keeping the baby?", "NTA.  Unless she was having an abortion, then there's no point in telling him, or if he's abusive, then no, it's better not to tell him. Otherwise, he has a right to know. And a right to know his kid.

Even if she doesn't want to use it, then it can go in a fund for the kid's education and future life.", "NTA if she didn\u2019t want him to know then she shouldn\u2019t be telling his friends that the baby is his.", "Mind your own business.

My father walked away before I was born and I can tell your now it fecks you up your whole life", "I just can't even fathom him being abusive in any way, makes me sick thinking about it", "I probably was a little hasty about it, I'll admit. We did the whole congratulations, baby names, all the stuff you talk about when someone tells you they're pregnant. She seemed pretty calm about the whole thing, which kind of put me off guard considering the situation. And then we started talking Mark and then it led me saying what I said.", ">maybe that he will try to get back with her after breaking her trust now that there is a baby etc.\n\nWhat do you mean breaking her trust?", "Right? I\u2019m stuck on the fact that she\u2019s telling people who the father is, but expects everyone to just\u2026not be open and honest with their friend? Did I miss something there?", "I mean I think I know the answer, but according to most of the responses it's down the middle.", "What I'm leaning towards is sitting and down and having one more conversation with Jennifer, and just bringing up some of these points that people have made. I really think she needs to tell him. But I might just have that conversation and then leave it to fate... I don't know, this sucks. \n\nI was thinking about getting Mark back out here for a weekend or something, but I doubt that's gonna be able to happen anytime soon", "It's her pregnancy but unless humans suddenly became able to reproduce by themselves, I think that maybe she didn't end up pregnant alone.", "Just because they're not together doesn't mean that the father doesn't have a right to know.", "Did she get herself pregnant? No? Then it is absolutely not her call. It's not only her child.", "What a disgusting thing to think. Why do people not give a flying crap about the innocent children? The child has a right to a father present in their lives\n\nA father has the right to know he has a child in the world do you really think that because you have a vagina it gives you the right to deny a child and a father a relationship\n\nWomen who believe this should have their children removed from their care so they know how it feels because obviously they don't care about their child because they don't want what's best for their child. They want what's best for themselves. They couldn't give a flying crap about their child", "My god you are an awful human being!", "The father needs to know...", "He deserves to know, it is his kid. It\u2019s not just his benefit to know but also the kids so that he can be able to take responsibility for it. Imagine growing up and then finding out you never had the opportunity to know your father because he doesn\u2019t even know you exist.", "It's one thing if she's decided not to have the kid, it's another when you have a living human being that will one day wonder who their father is. NTA", "Perfectly worded. She should told him before he accepted the offer or during.", "Couldn\u2019t have said it better myself", "Irish", "Then he deserves to know. My kids are my greatest joy. If someone took them from me, it would crush my soul. She may be carrying the baby, but it's both of their kid.", "She may be waiting until after the first trimester to tell him. \n\n\nIf she tells him early and he moves back and sacrifices the new job etc? and she loses the fetus (which is really common) it would be very messy.", "I get what you mean, that sounds shocking to me too, and sometimes we say the wrong thing when shocked. It currently makes it a mild YTA to me, but there are definitely other potential outcomes down the line. It would be a strong AH if you were to call up mark this instant and start a shitstorm that can probably be avoided, but it doesn't sound like you will.\n\nI'd say apologise and walk back the ultimatum for now. Talk to your wife about tackling the situation, she may be better suited to handle some of the coming conversations. Maybe hearing how it would affect you never learning you have a kid could help jennifer, maybe she needs to know that while he and more importantly the kid have a moral and legal right to form a bond, he won't just be able to take her kid or force an infant to fly across the country, maybe she needs your insight on mark as a potential father.  Hard to think of specific options because I don't really know where her head is at and I think your wife is more likely to find out. \n\nHopefully it will get it to N A H everyone wins. If she doesn't tell him after some more time to process and getting the support she needs to deal with sharing, I think you would be right to reinstate the ultimatum and if that doesn't work you should actually tell Mark.", "Yeah, I want to know this too.", "I meant that is how she may think about it in her current situation.\n\nLet me put it like this, would you go from a comitted relationship, to being left over a job, then finding out you will have a kid with this person, without that affecting your trust in a future romantic relationship with that person? You would likely get pressured by your surroundings to get back together for the kid. Would a voice in the back of your mind say 'yeah but what if there is another job in a couple years will he leave me and the kid?\n\nI am not saying he is wrong for prioritising his future over his relationship with her, or her staying where they were over her relationship with him. Just that it has been a couple big changes in quick succession that she is likely still processing and giving examples if potential thoughts.", "I assumed Jennifer only told OPs wife who the father is", "Yeah you are in a very difficult position, I don\u2019t envy you at all. \n\nI think like you said in your explanation, try encouraging Jennifer to tell Mark, it\u2019s more her job to do so at this point and Mark definitely deserves to know.\n\nif Mark does ask you in the future then I think at that point you have the right to be open with him and tell the truth as he is your friend.", "Yeah it really seems like a tough situation... \nIts just im a mom myself, im with the father of the kids. \n\nYes, I was pregnant, I gave birth - but they are not only my kids. My bf doesn't really know who his dad is and it has messed with him for 40 years. To me its bigger than her. Its also about the kid and mark. \n\nBut I hope you figure something out and it ends up okay and not just angry and hurt all the way around.", "??", "That is definitely a viable option. I'll keep that in mind", "Mmmm it is a tricky situation, it didn't sound like it was a bad breakup but the feelings would be all over the place. I think they need to talk though.", "Makes sense, just bold of her to do when she knows they are all friends. She put them in a terrible position.", "Would it just be considered sneaky or underhanded for me to try and get Mark to come back for like a weekend or something?", "You said \u201cfeck\u201d which is a distinctly Irish way of saying fuck", "Totally agree, assuming all goes well they have a whole co-parenting thing to set up at least.", "The way it came off was that they mainly broke up because of the distance and the chances of him coming back living in this side of the country are pretty slim. So as far as I know it was a amicable break up, but it's still painful I'm sure", "Agreed, she has put OP and his wife in a very awkward position", "Sneaky, maybe. Underhanded probably not. \n\nIf you ask him back or he comes back on his own accord, it\u2019s will come up at some point. It\u2019s just a matter of time.\n\nDo Mark and Jennifer still talk? What\u2019s their relationship like now?
