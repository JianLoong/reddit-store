I would still give her the chance to do it but eventually someone has to.", "NTA and you're doing BOTH of them a favor because if he moves and finds out she hid a kid from him, and then he challenges for custody, a court is going to look POORLY on her for intentionally hiding it.\n\nSo here's how it can hurt her: If two separated parents are coparenting a kid, and one parent moves, generally that parent is going to be responsible for the costs of travel and what not for them to be able to continue coparenting.\n\nHowever, if the coparenting BEGINS after one parent relocated after having not known about the kid, a court can decide both parents will be equally responsible for travel costs.\n\nThese are just generalizations and there are a million little nuances including the percent of custody each parent has, etc. But seriously she might not be doing herself a favor by trying to hide this kid.\n\nI think what you should really do is post about this situation in r/legaladvice and show your friend.", "NTA.  If it is truly his kid, he has every right to know and decide what he wants to do going forward.", "INFO: did you go straight to the ultimatum like you wrote it? \n\nThat would make you the A H to me. Your friend is just single, just found out she is pregnant and is clearly processing. Pretty shitty situation to be in. She may be afraid of messing up his life, maybe that he will be angry, maybe that he will try to get back with her after breaking her trust now that there is a baby etc. \n\nMark has a right to know, 100%, no doubt about it. But does he have the right to know instantly? In many happy couples the woman may take some time to plan a fun announcement, would that be messing with the father's rights? \n\nIt could have been a shocked conversation without an ultimatum there should have been a supportive encouraging conversation, if needed backed up by legal info about her rights and her childs rights in your state, if needed followed by a pressing conversation, and only then whip out the threats. Basically, why choose the brutal option while the kind option is right in front of you in dealing with your long term friend.", "NTA. It's not okay for her to keep that information from him.", "NTA.

If she chooses not to tell him, then gives up the baby, that puts the baby's placement in jeopardy later as Mark never gave up his parental rights.\n\nIf she is going to keep the baby (which I think you said was her plan), then Mark also has legal rights to the child. If he were to find out he has a child and she never told him, he could sue her for custody / visitation. It could go very badly. At the very least, they will need to co-parents together because again, he has legal rights unless he chooses to sign them away. The sooner they begin to work out how they will co-parent together, the better. The less bitterness there is between them when they begin to do that, the better. \n\nThe only situation in which you might be the asshole is if she were considering ending the pregnancy, and even then, that's a very tricky situation.", "Looks like OP already knows the answer\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s OPs right to tell mark, But I think it is Jennifer\u2019s duty to tell mark, he has a right to know.\n\nIt\u2019s only gonna make things awkward and raise more questions once the child is born if everyone\u2019s still all friendly with each other. \n\nBetter off being open and honest up front from the start", "NTA\n\nYour friend needs to know that he's becoming a father.

She also apparently did not tell you. So no you should not say anything. You are no one to her, and trying to play God with her life by giving her an ultimatum is complete abusive asshole territory.\n\nAt the absolute most, the next time you talk to him just ask if he still talks to her or if he's seeing anyone.

If once there is a child, and she tells YOU, talk to her about it. \n\nWhile I may think it would probably be a good idea for her to tell him, I'm not her. You are not her. None of us know what actually happened in their relationship. A lot of stuff happens behind closed doors that people might not want to believe.

WE don't know.", "Guy code clearly states that everything a guy does, this includes procreation, is his responsibility.  \n\nSometimes, women get in their own way.  She's not thinking clearly, in my opinion.  Guys, get in their own way a lot more mind you.  \n\nYou should give her a chance to let the friend know.

It's really, really not your news to tell though and giving Jennifer an ultimatum was shitty. \n\nI guess it's an ESH for me.", "NAH. I understand your concern but right now there isn\u2019t a baby, there\u2019s a medical condition that could end a lot of different ways and the person who is pregnant has the right to privacy and choice in who is supporting her through this stage. She told your wife because she\u2019s her friend and not you, or everyone else, that it\u2019s Marks baby. It\u2019s not clear she\u2019s telling everyone else that part. It\u2019s likely to get back to Mark eventually either way that she\u2019s pregnant when she starts to show. She could miscarry or have a stillbirth or choose to terminate before that. So she may be waiting for this to get more real before she discloses to him. You don\u2019t need to share your wife\u2019s friends confidential medical information with her ex just yet.  You also can\u2019t be sure who this guy is in a relationship. You know him as a friend, not a romantic partner. She may have decided not to tell him because he\u2019s controlling or emotionally abusive and she doesn\u2019t want to deal with that along with an unplanned pregnancy. She might be concerned he will believe she baby trapped him to force his return. \nIf this pregnancy ends with a child being born, then Mark does need to know. Unless he\u2019s actively dangerous, which it doesn\u2019t sound like is the case. If she\u2019s still planning to withhold the information then I think you have a totally different dilemma on your hands because the ethics question changes. And you would tell Jennifer you are going to tell Mark the truth if she doesn\u2019t so she has the opportunity to do so. I think she\u2019s going to resolve this on her own before hand because most people who start here are just panicking.", "NTA", "NTA - he deserves to know, and not telling him is just as damning.

Unless she was having an abortion, then there's no point in telling him, or if he's abusive, then no, it's better not to tell him. Otherwise, he has a right to know. And a right to know his kid.

They want what's best for themselves. They couldn't give a flying crap about their child", "My god you are an awful human being!", "The father needs to know...", "He deserves to know, it is his kid. It\u2019s not just his benefit to know but also the kids so that he can be able to take responsibility for it. Imagine growing up and then finding out you never had the opportunity to know your father because he doesn\u2019t even know you exist.", "It's one thing if she's decided not to have the kid, it's another when you have a living human being that will one day wonder who their father is.

If someone took them from me, it would crush my soul. She may be carrying the baby, but it's both of their kid.", "She may be waiting until after the first trimester to tell him. \n\n\nIf she tells him early and he moves back and sacrifices the new job etc? and she loses the fetus (which is really common) it would be very messy.", "I get what you mean, that sounds shocking to me too, and sometimes we say the wrong thing when shocked. It currently makes it a mild YTA to me, but there are definitely other potential outcomes down the line. It would be a strong AH if you were to call up mark this instant and start a shitstorm that can probably be avoided, but it doesn't sound like you will.\n\nI'd say apologise and walk back the ultimatum for now. Talk to your wife about tackling the situation, she may be better suited to handle some of the coming conversations. Maybe hearing how it would affect you never learning you have a kid could help jennifer, maybe she needs to know that while he and more importantly the kid have a moral and legal right to form a bond, he won't just be able to take her kid or force an infant to fly across the country, maybe she needs your insight on mark as a potential father.  Hard to think of specific options because I don't really know where her head is at and I think your wife is more likely to find out. \n\nHopefully it will get it to N A H everyone wins. If she doesn't tell him after some more time to process and getting the support she needs to deal with sharing, I think you would be right to reinstate the ultimatum and if that doesn't work you should actually tell Mark.", "Yeah, I want to know this too.", "I meant that is how she may think about it in her current situation.\n\nLet me put it like this, would you go from a comitted relationship, to being left over a job, then finding out you will have a kid with this person, without that affecting your trust in a future romantic relationship with that person? You would likely get pressured by your surroundings to get back together for the kid. Would a voice in the back of your mind say 'yeah but what if there is another job in a couple years will he leave me and the kid?\n\nI am not saying he is wrong for prioritising his future over his relationship with her, or her staying where they were over her relationship with him. Just that it has been a couple big changes in quick succession that she is likely still processing and giving examples if potential thoughts.", "I assumed Jennifer only told OPs wife who the father is", "Yeah you are in a very difficult position, I don\u2019t envy you at all. \n\nI think like you said in your explanation, try encouraging Jennifer to tell Mark, it\u2019s more her job to do so at this point and Mark definitely deserves to know.\n\nif Mark does ask you in the future then I think at that point you have the right to be open with him and tell the truth as he is your friend.", "Yeah it really seems like a tough situation... \nIts just im a mom myself, im with the father of the kids. \n\nYes, I was pregnant, I gave birth - but they are not only my kids. My bf doesn't really know who his dad is and it has messed with him for 40 years. To me its bigger than her. Its also about the kid and mark. \n\nBut I hope you figure something out and it ends up okay and not just angry and hurt all the way around.", "??", "That is definitely a viable option. I'll keep that in mind", "Mmmm it is a tricky situation, it didn't sound like it was a bad breakup but the feelings would be all over the place. I think they need to talk though.", "Makes sense, just bold of her to do when she knows they are all friends. She put them in a terrible position.", "Would it just be considered sneaky or underhanded for me to try and get Mark to come back for like a weekend or something?", "You said \u201cfeck\u201d which is a distinctly Irish way of saying fuck", "Totally agree, assuming all goes well they have a whole co-parenting thing to set up at least.", "The way it came off was that they mainly broke up because of the distance and the chances of him coming back living in this side of the country are pretty slim. So as far as I know it was a amicable break up, but it's still painful I'm sure", "Agreed, she has put OP and his wife in a very awkward position", "Sneaky, maybe. Underhanded probably not. \n\nIf you ask him back or he comes back on his own accord, it\u2019s will come up at some point. It\u2019s just a matter of time.\n\nDo Mark and Jennifer still talk?

Stay out of it and mind your own business.", "Going against the top few comments here, but yeah YTA. That\u2019s not your info to share, it\u2019s Jennifer\u2019s. Being friends with a couple doesn\u2019t give you total insight into why she\u2019s making this decision. You can talk to *her* about it, but calling him up to tell him won\u2019t end well. Once the baby arrives, if he still doesn\u2019t know, then you have more of a leg to stand on but until then you should let the mother take the lead. It\u2019s hers to tell, not yours.", "INFO: Is it possible that she doesn\u2019t want to tell him because she\u2019s scared that he will try to take the kid to where he is at? Idk, she needs to tell him but you were definitely hasty with telling her the ultimatum and she has plenty to be freaked out about to be honest.", "YTA it\u2019s none of your business and your wife was wrong to tell you. This is second hand gossip. You don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll keep it at all. She could choose to terminate. Again NONE of that is ANY of your business. And if she terminates it\u2019s also none of your friend\u2019s business. Her body, her choice. Stay out of it. And I hope Jennifer finds better friends who don\u2019t hang her dirty laundry out for all to see. This is why having a married bestie and confidant is a bad idea.", "Look she got upset because you found out and then immediately gave her an ultimatum.\n\nUltimately, it's not your business, and the correct thing to do when someone confides in you is to support them, emotionally, and then gently ask some questions if you have concerns. Then you listen to them and wait. If it's not resolved in one conversation, you give it a little time, then come back to the topic another time after you've thought through your opinion and your obligation to the other person.

Maybe he got out there, and it's not what he thought, or it is, but he misses his relationship, home, family more. It's all unknown.  He should get to make the decision on how involved he wants to be. When you have sex, you are making an intentional decision and know the possibility that it may result in pregnancy.  As it stands, she sounds like she is completely willing to raise this baby on her own, so if he decides to relinquish his parental rights, it's no different than what she's planning on now. I understand she's worried he'll come back and resent her later, but I think he's owed the truth and chance to make the decision for himself.

When women do this thing of 'I don't want it to mess up his life...' honestly, it's not noble, it's infuriating, because this pregnancy will then be a baby, who becomes a kid that feels abandoned who becomes an adult who feels resentful to their dad, and they either find each other in later life and regret everything they didn't have or find out about the other when it's too late for the one to get to know the other (most commonly Dad is gone, child is left wondering about the other side of the story and who their estranged parent was. In a world where the social narrative is to absolutely dump on dead beat dads, I think it's even worse to actively plan to keep a child from their father. Give her a timeframe, but if she doesn't do it, tell him, because he deserves to know. I would also make it a short timeframe because as much as no one should shoot the messenger, if he knows you were sat on this for a long while and didn't tell him, man's going to be furious with you, because he can be furious with you. It's harder to be furious with the co-parent of your child because you have to be civil with them for everything else, whereas you, he can be spitting angry with you relatively easily.

She might feel between a rock and a hard place, too, and is trying to find her \u201cfooting\u201d with the whole situation.  Is it possible that she told OP & wife because she knew OP would force her to tell him, therefore taking the dilemma away?  I don\u2019t even mean in a sneaky way\u2026.maybe even subconsciously? \n\nI say this primarily because of a few things:\n-by all accounts and OP\u2019s replies, everyone involved seems relatively mature, so I\u2019m not sensing that Jennifer\u2019s motives are selfish or underhanded.\n-Jennifer likely feels a lot of guilt (she shouldn\u2019t, but women are generally made to feel solely responsible for pregnancies, unfortunately).  It sounds like she feels like she\u2019s interfering with his life plans with this baby, and doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for derailing his life.\n-Jennifer certainly has people she can talk to about this that aren\u2019t good friends with Mark.  She specifically stayed behind because her family is here.  Telling good friend\u2019s of Mark\u2019s was a choice.  She had to know that you\u2019d push the issue, one way or another.\n\nOP, I wonder if you approached it differently, you might actually be a blessing to her?

What I do know, however, is that job opportunities can come and go, but the opportunity to love and know your child is precious and rare.  Mark would want that.  I think you should tell him, but if it would be easier, can I tell him for you?  I can explain your concerns and tell him that you don\u2019t want him to feel any obligation, but he can contact you if or when he\u2019s ready to talk?  That way, he can take time to think and digest before you have to talk to him? He\u2019s my friend, so I will not keep this secret from him, but I want to help you both, not hurt you.  Let\u2019s figure this out.\u201d\n\nThis is just what\u2019s bouncing around in my head, and it also should go without saying that if he was abusive, etc, then that changes everything and you need to let her protect herself and her child.", "As far as I know, she is intending to keep the baby, at least that is how it came off.", "I'm not a hundred percent sure on the timeline. He moved a little over a month ago though.", "Agree. Once she decided to have the baby, she has no right to keep his child from him or rob him of years. And the child has the right to BOTH parents.
