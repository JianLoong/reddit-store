I worked really hard to graduate high school a year early and after that I've been working 40hrs a week for the summer to save up for school. For the first time in forever I'm able to afford all the nice brand school supplies that I paid for and it was about $300 that i don't feel bad about. Once school started it's my goal to be friends with more people who are nursing major so we can help each when the time comes. I meant this one girl Ataya (F18) and she has absolutely no school supplies. Just 1 notebook and a highlighter. One day she showed up to class very late and she wanted to sit by me which was fine. She asked for a pen which was also fine because i have more pens for myself. I'm a person who likes to use different colors to take notes, i just gave her a black pen. As she seen me using my color pens she started to ask to use them to which annoyed me because i just gave you a pen but i said yes be i didn't want to be rude. I made a mistake on my notes so lused my whiteout and she proceeds to ask to use it which also annoyed me because she was wasting it because she didn't know how to get it out like you can just scribble out your mistake. Our professor told use we can take a bathroom break and so I put all of my pens back in my pencil pouch so she wouldn't have to use my colorful pens but i still let her use the black pen I gave her so after the bathroom break I went back to using my colorful pens and once again she asks for a colorful pen of mine to which I said yes but then she just started going in my pencil pouch and taking them and that's rude in my opinion. My school supplies are expensive and i don't understand why she couldn't just use to black pen I gave her it's not my problem that she's unorganized and don't have school supplies. I'm not obligated to share the stuff I worked hard for.

You were being nice to lend a pen, but she overstepped a line.", "NTA - Kindly tell her to get her own supplies.", "I went back to school in my 30s. I would lend/give a pen or pencil (I ALWAYS had extras), but I would absolutely not empty out my stash for someone.\n\nI did, however, make use of Staples' yearly school supply sale in August and would splurge $30-40 on an entire year's school supplies of notebooks, folders, pens, highlighters, etc.\n\nI will note that my backpack had a section for pens and pencils, so no one could easily reach for it and grab at my things. Going forward, put out the pens you need, and put your pencil case back in your backpack or bag so graspy-hands cannot try to help herself.\n\nNTA", "Stop agreeing to things you don't want to do.\n\nNTA but if you're a pushover, you're not going to have a fun time being a nurse.", "NTA. If you still feel bad about her situation and can afford it I\u2019d say just get her like a $20 gift card to Staples or Office Max as a pointed way to say buy your own stuff.", "YTA for not using paragraphs", "YTA, but it isn\u2019t for not for not *wanting* to share. Y T A because you should have set boundaries. Instead, you got upset your non-existent boundary was crossed. You told her she could use a pen & you didn\u2019t say anything about her using/not using the coloured pens. Eventually she was taking them and using them because it would have also been weird/rude to many people had she kept asking them if she could take another pen - thereby interrupting the lesson & both of you miss out on information because someone is repeatedly asking if it\u2019s okay to use the purple pen, blue pen, red pen, etc.\n\nYou\u2019re not in high school anymore & this whole thing reads like a very high school mentality. Rather than being mad at her (& you don\u2019t know her circumstances) it\u2019s your job to politely set boundaries. \u2018I\u2019m happy to loan you a pen.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry; I have a method to my madness with the coloured pens. I prefer not to loan those out.\u2019 No need to be rude, get upset or become passive aggressive & expect her to read your mind. Say what you mean/mean what you say & do it in a clear, firm but kind way.", "YTA\n\nNot for not wanting to share but for not setting boundaries. Look at this from her perspective...she asked and you said yes. After several acceptances of her request to use your colored pens, she felt you were clearly fine with sharing. It would have been an easy step to tell her you were fine with letting her use a pen, but the rest are yours. Now it's a whole thing.\n\nI'll give you a pass here because you are only 17 and this is a lesson that many people, especially women, have to learn through much more serious experiences than this one. Say what you mean. Don't accept things you don't like to try to appease people. Be kind but still set clear boundaries. You'll be a lot happier.", "No, you're not an AH.\n\nWho knows what her situation is.  Maybe she is too poor to afford her own supplies.  Maybe she is so used to having everything handed to her that she doesn't value anything.  Maybe she is trying to connect with you and sees asking to borrow things as a way to do that.  Whatever the case, you should not feel like you have to do anything for her that you can't afford.\n\nI would buy her a cheap ball-point pen next time you're at the supermarket and say next time she asks for something that you got her a pen to use.  Let her know that you'd love to be more generous with your stuff, but have a thing for nice supplies and can't afford to replace it after saving for so long.  Keep it very brief and say it almost like a joke, then ask her how she's doing with the class (change the subject).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
