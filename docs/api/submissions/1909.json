Henry just needs some extra time right now, really it's up to your Ex to make this happen. \n\nThe StepSon is 12 not 5, at that age- if his mom explains it correctly - he'd understand how his 3 year old 'brother' has been feeling anxious and needs to see all the grown ups happy, and spend an afternoon doing things a 3 year old would enjoy.

I hope you can find a counselor or therapist on your son also to make him understand about your current situation with his mom without making anyone look bad.\n\nAlso, always remind your son that you are open to communicate with him anytime about anything, there might be something bothering him or something he doesn\u2019t quite understand yet, at least you are there to make him understand things!

She needs to realize that her kid is entitled to having time with his parenrs that don't include his moms GFs son.  Your son is 3 and a 12 year old is old enough to understand that you aren't his family and sometimes the 3 yr old will have time away with his mom and you that doesn't include him.  My guess is that the 12 year old was raised in a way that enabled him to get whatever he wanted and always be the center of attention or else he would have a temper tantrum, and your ex doesn't want to deal with it.\n\n\nLook you have full custody for a reason. if she isnt willing to meet her 3 year olds emotional needs and refuses to put his feelings first in a situation that requires it for this, I can only imagine what it is happening when he is spending time there without you.  I cant imagine that the 12 year old behaves like that with you and in front of you and is the exact opposite at home.  Given that she refuses to not include him in this, I'm sure she is more cognizant of his feelings over the 3 year old. \n\n\nPart of me thinks that they want to force you to be the 12 year olds daddy as well, and that is why he is like that with you.

Before our divorce, I was working 14 hour days and I wasnt able to spend that much time with my son.  When my ex broke the news that our marriage was over and the circumstances surrounding it, there were a few weeks where I only saw him weekends.  That all changed when his mom started enjoying her new lifestyle and pushed Henry off on me.   I changed my schedule at work to work much less hours, Henry started thriving, and his mom put up zero fight as long as I gave her the house.  So my son went from pretty much never seeing me to being the primary caretaker.\n\nHe can't really articulate what's going through his little mind right now, but I suspect it has to do with feelings of abandonment vs abuse.

How do you know visits are going fine when you aren't there? It sounds like she doesn't want to see him. Are you sure she's treating him decently? Abuse doesn't have to be physical. If she just ignores him the whole time that's a shit thing for a 3 year old. I hope you can get him communicating with you soon.

Because, imagine the shoe were on the other foot and she said I'll just keep him all the time and you can see him for a few hours a week. I'm going to guess you'd say hell no and do whatever it takes to get time with him because you love him. She's giving the impression that she doesn't feel that. If I get that vibe from a post online your son has surely picked up on it. If he's happy on FaceTime with you, perhaps it's because he's seeing his dad, not because he's having fun with mom.

But I think the day should just be with you and the ex spending time together and making Henry the center of attention for you both. It would be super weird to include stepson's mother and not him. It would create the reverse scenario for the stepson, in my opinion. Your goal here is so that your son understand that you and your ex are still 'friends' and love him. That bond needs to be cemented before you add other people in the mix.

It is a reasonable request that it's just the adults and your son since he is the one needing to see this and get attention from all at the same time. Stepson can chill at a friends for a few hours.

If he has trouble communicating then his only choice is shouting etc and I think that might not be a good environment for him with his vibrant and expressive big bro...  \nIt is obviously another guess, but I am trying to put myself in the little guy's shoes  : I cant talk, I have a very much bigger brother who is very expressive and I feel like my mom left me alone with my dad, who I can tell loves me very much and is trying very hard for me (changed your life around his vital needs)... so when I go to my mom I feel kinda lost, like why am I here if she doesnt want me - I am sure the big brother is very kind to him, and I doubt his mom or step mom are unkind, but if she is blocking his speech therapy I feel like there might be some impatience there while you are not in the picture, and I think inevitably, from all these factors, there is a large void of miscommunication.  \nOnce again I think you are on the right path, I think some good time with you and his mom is vital... but if his mom is not going to do that, then maybe (and this is why I suggested specifically scenarios where you take him out of the house to places where there are other people who might be kind and patient with him, vibrant places where there is plenty of visual and auditory stimulation, but vitally the potential to meet other people, but also places where you and him will be together like a team) a place not at home, where he can feel free to shout and express himself however he wants in public might be a good move...  \nBut once again, I dont think we can know what is going on in his head, only he can know that, and until he is communicating somehow there is no way to find out...  \nJust a thought on the communication front, and I am sure you have thought about this, but I will suggest it anyways.

Your son is not treated well when he goes to his mother's home. 12-year old is probably mean to him for taking attention or your ex ignores your son in favor of her step-son. I'd take son to therapy if he is verbal. This is not a good situation. Any kid who hides from their mother is doing it for a reason.", "NTA, but that situation with the step son is kind of like they want OP to be his dad to give him to OP too. but i could be reaching.", "NTA if it's just you and ex, but you're definitely unreasonable if you want to include ex's gf but not her son.", "Please protect your child. This post screams of abuse. Your little baby 3 year son is clearly terrified of what is going on with his mom and his moms new family. \n\nDon\u2019t let him go back. Fight tooth and nail for him. ITS NOT NORMAL FOR A CHILD TO FEAR ITS MOTHER.\n\n\nITS EXTRA TERRIFYING for these little ones who are speech delayed HAVE NO VOICE. Imagine being lost and frightened, punched, hit, yelled at, and never being able to have the ability to tell anyone about it. \n\nSomething is wrong. He\u2019s only 3, just a baby. Protect him. He\u2019s NOT fine when he is with them. He\u2019s happier in the FaceTime calls because HE SEES YOU. YOU are his happiness.", "NTA... Have you asked mom to sit in on the speech therapy sessions? If he's having trouble communicating, your therapist is using other techniques to help to understand what he's asking for and the therapy sessions are a good way to observe what works and reinforce what he's learning. It may help her communicate with him and make him feel more open to trying. Even phrasing questions different can get drastically different outcomes for kiddos.", "Honestly me and my dad or mom would have one on one days because sometimes even with multiple kids having a day where one kid is the center can help a lot and create a healthier environment where they know they aren't neglected", "exactly, I'd imagine having a lot of siblings one could really start feeling disconnected from your parents.", "Wait, she got the house? So your son lost having Mom full time and lost his home that he gets to visit while stepbrother is living there all the time? Is the stepbrother also sleeping in your son's old room? Poor little guy probably feels like he has been replaced in his mother's affections.", "I divorced when my daughter was three. If she acted like this when we (parents) were in the same room with her I would have been terrified. Therapy is never a bad idea. NTA & you are doing a great job for your little guy!"]}
