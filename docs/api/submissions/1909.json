The fact that you want to spend 'family days' with everybody - stepson included shows you want the best for all the kids.  Henry just needs some extra time right now, really it's up to your Ex to make this happen. \n\nThe StepSon is 12 not 5, at that age- if his mom explains it correctly - he'd understand how his 3 year old 'brother' has been feeling anxious and needs to see all the grown ups happy, and spend an afternoon doing things a 3 year old would enjoy.  This is a great time for StepSon to have a play date at a friends house / visit grandma etc.  That night Ex&Gf can let him pick a movie/ game and make his favorite meal.", "NTA but OP I would try and talk with your son about his feelings. Him becoming sad and refusing to talk when you and your ex are together is concerning. \n\nHe obviously sees you as his protector since he hides behind you. But why would he need protection from you in the presence of his mother?\n\nI really hope it isn\u2019t the case, but I worry something is going on that you haven\u2019t seen.", "NTA. Even though your child is a 3 year old, your divorce may have taken a toll on him. Your suggestion is great on your situation to allow him to understand that even you two, his parents, are already divorced, he still has 2 loving parents regardless. \n\nI feel your decision on not including her stepson is valid! I hope you can find a counselor or therapist on your son also to make him understand about your current situation with his mom without making anyone look bad.\n\nAlso, always remind your son that you are open to communicate with him anytime about anything, there might be something bothering him or something he doesn\u2019t quite understand yet, at least you are there to make him understand things! Always remember communication and patience are your partners in parenting!", "NTA\n\nThe other kid isnt yours so you arent required to take him", "NTA. The stepson may be the reason he is withdrawn and \u201cdifferent\u201d when he comes home. Like you said SS is an awesome kid but takes center stage. It\u2019s not a bad thing but it\u2019s also not helpful in this situation. You want your kiddo to be center stage to show him he matters. You can\u2019t do that if SS is there. It\u2019s just not possible. And yes SS is a part of the family...but he\u2019s not a part of your family. He is a part of the ex\u2019s family. It\u2019s kinda like saying \u201cmy parents are inviting you over to celebrate something we do so that our kid can have both parents involved\u201d and her saying...but my girlfriend\u2019s son should come too. No. He shouldn\u2019t. He\u2019s not a part of your family. She needs to understand there is a difference.", "NTA! Is there a chance of finding a counselor who would back up what you\u2019re suggesting? Sometimes people who wouldn\u2019t listen to you will comply if the suggestion is coming from an experienced licensed family councilor. I think you\u2019re totally right through, ex needs to focus on the kid she created with you first before SS. It\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t offer to do it later.", "NTA you sound like a great father", "NTA - Youre making a totally reasonable request. Its no surprise you got full custody, you seem like a observant and fantastic parent. Perhaps his discomfort is his awareness that his mother doesnt care as much about hin", "NTA Trying to make everything about all of the kids all of the time can leave one feeling less special and only one of these is your responsibility.\n\nThe compromises offered seem really reasonable too", "nta  \nI am no psychologist, but it does sound like your boy needs some time with you guys where he can be the centre of attention - come out of his bubble so to speak. I wonder though if you simply taking him to some fun father and son things, like (if you can find one) an arcade, or go to the beach, as long as you make sure that it is all about him / something he wants to do... idk... I havent been a parent, but I was a kid (even if it was long ago)... and some of my best memories from being 1 of 4 kids with plenty of drama in the house was when it was just my dad and I going for an ice cream and talking or things like that since most of the times it was all the kids all the time.", "NTA. I'm not sure why you'd think you're being unreasonable.", "NTA - This isn't about fairness and sibling bonding, it's about helping your son get through a developmental stage in his life.", "Nta. Remind your ex she can chose not to spend quality time alone with Henry. Let her know that because he sees so little of her, it could effect their bond forever.\n\nI think the reaction when you are all together says a lot. He trusts you to be there for him. He does not know why she left. He does not trust her to be there for him. \n\nAnd a 12 year old will be vocal and definitely be a part of conversations and activities . A 3 year old, not so much. Seems he is feeling ignored by her, or at least not at home with her.\n\nIf she doesn't fix this quick, it will not be fixable.", "NTA. Your suggestion is eminently reasonable and puts the child first.", "NTA.  It sounds like you are the only one truly willing to compromise and find a suitable solution.", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t imagine the pain of going through this for you and Henry. Please for yourself and him, go see a therapist. Especially Henry, it sounds like he is having a hard time processing this, and it\u2019s a huge red flag that he is coming back oddly reserved and hiding from his mom.  \n\nThe fact your ex\u2019s stepson gravitates to you, Henry\u2019s protector, and pushes himself center stage sound like he is trying to hog all the attention from Henry, and from how your ex is pushing, it looks like she\u2019s prioritizing her stepson (and new girlfriend\u2019s /their relationship\u2019s happiness) at the expense of Henry\u2019s mental health. Stepson isn\u2019t the asshole but 12 is an old enough age where your ex could explain that she needs to be a parent to her young child and give him some support in their very limited time together compared to her and stepson\u2019s full time? living together situation.", "NTA, sometimes parents go on parent/ child dates with just 1 child because they need their attention. it's not an abnormal thing to do. Your son needs quality time with both his parents, that's all you're trying to provide. If she feels it unfair, her and her SO can have a day just with her step son and them to give him quality time too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She needs to realize that her kid is entitled to having time with his parenrs that don't include his moms GFs son.  Your son is 3 and a 12 year old is old enough to understand that you aren't his family and sometimes the 3 yr old will have time away with his mom and you that doesn't include him.  My guess is that the 12 year old was raised in a way that enabled him to get whatever he wanted and always be the center of attention or else he would have a temper tantrum, and your ex doesn't want to deal with it.\n\n\nLook you have full custody for a reason. if she isnt willing to meet her 3 year olds emotional needs and refuses to put his feelings first in a situation that requires it for this, I can only imagine what it is happening when he is spending time there without you.  I cant imagine that the 12 year old behaves like that with you and in front of you and is the exact opposite at home.  Given that she refuses to not include him in this, I'm sure she is more cognizant of his feelings over the 3 year old. \n\n\nPart of me thinks that they want to force you to be the 12 year olds daddy as well, and that is why he is like that with you.  Maybe he is jealous that the 3 year old has a dad and the GF and Ex assume it's on you to provide that role.  I have never heard of placating an ex's step child and spending time with them and needing to include them in something that has nothing to do with him.\n\n\nIf she can't prioritize her kid then why should you prioritize her step kid?", "NTA. The entire purpose of this day is to center your son so that he feels connected and comfortable with the new normal your family is working with, it should be entirely about him and his needs. Your ex needs to recognize and acknowledge that sometimes it does have to be about your son and him alone, especially when it comes to things post-divorce, and pushing for one big happy blended family at the expense of your son's needs is not good parenting.", "NTA. Is your ex\u2019s stepsons father in the picture? Im curious if your ex and her gf are trying to push a fatherly role on you if he isn\u2019t. Regardless, you\u2019re right, your son does need time with just you and your ex. Unfortunately it looks like your ex is going to be one of those parents that prioritizes their stepchildren over their biological once they get into a new relationship.", "YTA for expecting the new girlfriend to come and leave her kid at home. It reasonable to ask your sons other parent to do a day focused on him, but it\u2019s unreasonable to expect her new partner to come while excluding her child.", "yta", "I do try an explain things, but my son isn't really speaking clearly yet (hes in speech therapy, something that was roadblocked by his mom every step of the way), so conversations are a bit one-way.  He gets frustrated when trying to communicate, like this morning he wanted me to draw him a fish and I couldn't understand for a bit :(\n\nThe dynamics of our relationship **heavily** changed over the past 2 years.  Before our divorce, I was working 14 hour days and I wasnt able to spend that much time with my son.  When my ex broke the news that our marriage was over and the circumstances surrounding it, there were a few weeks where I only saw him weekends.  That all changed when his mom started enjoying her new lifestyle and pushed Henry off on me.   I changed my schedule at work to work much less hours, Henry started thriving, and his mom put up zero fight as long as I gave her the house.  So my son went from pretty much never seeing me to being the primary caretaker.\n\nHe can't really articulate what's going through his little mind right now, but I suspect it has to do with feelings of abandonment vs abuse.  Also, when we were married my ex and I did not have the best relationship.", "I feel like the 12 year old and the ex ans GF want OP to take on the dad role with the 12 year old.  I can picture it now, \"how dare OP take his son on vacation, the 12 year old wants to go with them on their father and son trip.\"", "Fortunately my son and I have a father and son night every night!\n\nThe only real problem is when his mother and I are in the same room and he becomes severely withdrawn.", "Maybe from the kids moms standpoint of both kids being treated equally? OPs post history is a ride lol", "\"Stepson\" never had a male influence in his life and his mom doesn't let him play video games or roughhouse.  I am a male, play games, and roughhouse.  \n\nIt's a weird scenario straight out of a sitcom but I am not going to take my feelings out on a kid, even if he's not mine.\n\nHenry is only afraid of his mom when her and I are in the same room (to my knowledge).  When I facetime with him he seems relatively happy when he is in his mom's care.", "I really appreciate that :)\n\nTrying my best.", "SS father not in picture. He was born to two women.", "I did express that whether or not the new GF came was up to them.  I just didnt want to sound like I was explicitly excluding her.", "New girlfriend most likely had another partner to have said kid at some point. I\u2019m sure they, her parents, another family member, a friend, a coworker, a babysitter could watch new girlfriend\u2019s son for at least 30 minutes so OP, his ex, and new gf can comfort a child in grief.", "LOL why?", "no", "Look you're definitely NTA in any way, but I'm gonna side with the other comment, like it's not really normal for him to be hiding behind you when it's just his mom there. How do you know visits are going fine when you aren't there? It sounds like she doesn't want to see him. Are you sure she's treating him decently? Abuse doesn't have to be physical. If she just ignores him the whole time that's a shit thing for a 3 year old. I hope you can get him communicating with you soon. It's weird that his mom would be blocking that too...unless you know she's abusing him and doesn't want him to be able to communicate that.", "Do you think it's really because his mom triggers him?  I mean if the 12 year old demands your attention and she seems to prioritize including him in everything with you, then maybe he isnt being treated well with her.", "If you don't create boundaries regarding the step son, they will continually push you to be the father in his life.\n\n1. They will want you to bring him on vacation with you and your son cause it's not fair.\n\n\n2. Expect you to provide the same amount of gifts \n\n\n3. Take him to stay over for a night to spend time with him \n\n4. I've read stories about parents expecting their ex and the ex's family to include their step child in that part of thr family cause it's not fair that the bio kid has family , family parties and gifts from them and the step kid who has no relation nor relationship with bio kids mom or dad.", "I get that it's not normal.  Maybe I am not seeing things from all perspectives but if I found out that my son was abused in any way I would use **every** resource I have to protect my son.   I just don't see it from my POV.\n\nI guess I don't know how things are going when I am not there, but when he's in her care I do facetime him everyday.  He does seem quiet on calls but seems relatively happy.  Ill keep an eye out more.", "That's what I thought. Is something  happening whilst he is with her household that you wont have inside knowledgeabout? Seems sad that he suddenly is sad and shy around his mom. Is your boy the sort that would express if he has been shouted at or is being picked at? Is step mom taking the lead at home?\n\nDay out together seems a nice way to make him feel loved but if he hides away now, will he enjoy himself whilst out with them?\n\nNTA", "You sound like a good dad and I'm sure you'd move mountains for your kid. The thing is...when you say she didn't fight for any kind of custody or visitation...I immediately think she's a terrible mom. Because, imagine the shoe were on the other foot and she said I'll just keep him all the time and you can see him for a few hours a week. I'm going to guess you'd say hell no and do whatever it takes to get time with him because you love him. She's giving the impression that she doesn't feel that. If I get that vibe from a post online your son has surely picked up on it. If he's happy on FaceTime with you, perhaps it's because he's seeing his dad, not because he's having fun with mom. Sometimes when my toddler is having a meltdown, I FaceTime my mom because he immediately cheers up when he sees her.", ">If he's happy on FaceTime with you, perhaps it's because he's seeing his dad, not because he's having fun with mom.\n\nYou know what I didn't even consider this.\n\nI have to think on this."]}
