Worst case is control issues and that language is problematic as well. Be careful and assert your feelings.", "NTA. Your food-bully bf was TA. He didn't listen and ruined a simple meal you were looking forward to. You'll need to have it out with him on this. You should be able to decide what you eat.

It was extremely controlling and disrespectful of your bf to \"fix \" your sandwich especially after you specifically told him no. Regardless of how you feel about spicing or even food allergies, for that meal you were craving what you wanted and what you made.

Your boyfriend is extremely rude, especially if he's insisting you eat food after he threw hot sauce on it when he knows you don't like it. That's abusive and toxic as hell.  He's got a screw loose if he believes people should somehow be grateful for him jumping in screwing around with their food. That's a good way to get in a fistfight.", "Him experimenting when he is cooking a meal for the both of you is completely different from him deciding to unilaterally \u201cdress up\u201d your sandwich that you made for yourself. \n\nThis is rude, controlling and condescending.
