My husband has ASD which makes it hard for him to maintain a job. This hasn't been a problem for me, as I make a decent wage and can afford a modest but decent life for our family of 4. \n\nIn 2020, my husband worked at a fast food restraunt for a couple months and met a homeless man, who he quickly became friends with. We'll call him Rob (42m). One cold night, Rob and his then girlfriend asked to stay with us for a while. We had a guest room, and though uncomfortable, I agreed. After a week, their nightly arguments between eachother and general household hygene were too much to bear, so I kicked them out. When they left, the guest room was trashed, and there were pills and needles everywhere. As a mother, this disturbed me, and I have never stopped being wary of Rob.\n\nFast forward to July 1st 2023- Our guest room has turned into a storage room, and it would take work to get it livable again. Rob has broken up with his girlfriend and has gotten custody of his daughter 15f from a different woman, and her 8 month old puppy. Rob was sick of living with his parents and burned bridges with them. My husband came to me panicked one evening asking me to go pick them up, because they have nowhere else to go. For context, only I drive. \n\nReluctantly I again agreed to host Rob, mostly because I can't stand his daughter, we'll call her Ann, being on the street. With the guest room out of comission, they take my elder son's room. Both sons have bunkbeds, so I figure it will be manageable temporarily.\n\nInitially, Rob promises to be out in a week, I knew it was a lie as he had no money and no plans, but I wasn't concerned that it would take longer. My sons are in online school, so he promises to be out by the time school starts 8/14, so my son can use his room for school. Another lie.\n\nLiving with these 2 has been awful. They don't pay rent, or do chores. Rob only works about 3 days a week. Ann eats all our expensive snack food and refuses to eat meals I cook. She ate 12 icecream cones in 3 days, my son's whole month of treats. Rob has ruined our yard, with cigarette butts and trash everywhere. Their dog has dug in multiple places, and they're not training him not to. My sons room is trashed by them, and they've broken dishes. They don't clean the sink after using it and they don't flush the the toilet. Living with them is driving me crazy. Ann is spoiled, but she is very sweet, and she is a child. I don't like Rob, but he says he has gotten sober.\n\nAt this point, I'm the only one who cleans, cooks and pays bills, and I can't do it for 2 extra people. I told my husband I want them gone before my son turns 15 in October. He said I'm being unreasonable. They have nowhere to go. I told him a shelter may have resources for them and I can't handle this any more. It is not my fault they're in this situation and I can't live like this, and I don't think my sons deserve this either.

Instead of answering each post I'm going to address them here. \n\nFirst- when it comes to the drugs, Rob swears they were his gf's, and he has been clean from alcohol and drugs for over a year. Once again, I don't know how accurate this is, but he doesn't scream at his daughter, or us, like he did at gf. In fact, other than complaining about work, he is very quiet and keeps his head down now, since he knows I don't like him.\n\nSecond- Cps is already involved. No court awarded Rob custody. Ann's mother abandoned her to him. He had to get CPS and the courts involved to get her into school, and to revoke the child support. Poor Ann is in an awful situation.\n\nWhich brings me to the third point- the ONLY reason I let them in is because of Ann and her puppy. I feel awful for her. Being spoiled and quietly rude(not cleaning, not flushing) doesn't feel like a reason to condemn HER. If it was just him, he never would've stepped foot in my house. Her grandparents are supposedly verbally abusive too, so that is not a good option for her unfortunately.\n\nAnd lastly, my husband has Autism. (ASD as stated above) It affects him every day, and tasks you and I take for granted are difficult for him. He helps our boys with their school, and does help with house chores when he is not overstimulated. It is a constant battle for him, but we have worked for years to improve his productivity.

It's sweet to be altruistic, but you're putting your family at risk here *after* this man has already trashed your house and left drug paraphernalia all over it.", "There\u2019s no education in the second kick of a mule.", "Definitely agree. Her #1 job is to ensure her sons have a safe environment at home and she is failing them currently.", "I think this is too aggressively phrased. I have ASD and I've definitely fallen for a few sob stories in my time. I completely agree that OP needs to get these people out of their house, however much the husband protests, but let's remember that at the heart of this is a kind and generous impulse. It's not OP's or their husband's fault that sounds like the friend and the daughter can't be helped.", "And change the locks. And possibly get a ring.  This guy or his daughter is likely gonna be pissed.  YTA for putting your family through this again.  If CPS finds drugs or needles in your son\u2019s room, your kids will be taken away.", "I didn\u2019t see where anyone had said it yet \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She is definitely his daughter. Her mother got sick of being a parent of a teen and dropped her off one day at his parents place while he was living there, and never came back. Ann had her birthday here mid July and her mom straight up told her she would not be coming or bringing Ann's half sister. She didn't want \"the drama.\" She didn't even say happy birthday before hanging up. I heard the whole thing, her mom is awful.", "Nothing can even justify it. Poor children.", "She doesn't have to eat their snacks and refuse actual meals though does she?  If she's not paying for the expensive food then she doesn't get to eat the expensive food.", "Housework and cooking can be a problem for us due to executive dysfunction, however it is our responsibility still as adults to find a way to make it work..I personally have found help from support groups with other autistics where we share tips and whatnot. It's not easy but it's doable and if it isn't then at the very least OPs husband needs to stop bringing more people and more problems into the house.", "Sometimes an executive functioning problem can impede but working out a cleaning routine ect can circumvent that. At least in my husbands case.", "Husband is def using drugs with homeless man", "This\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 my thoughts exactly. As an former addict, who's been in recovery for 6 years & successfully sober for 3.5 years. There's a reason the husband is befriending random homeless addicts.. and it's not because he is Forrest Gump. I would be popping my husband with random drug tests. When I read that the second time Rob was homeless the husband panicked and begged OP to let Rob stay that he was so worried \ud83d\ude2b like what!?!?  This sounds so fishy.. also hubby stays home does NOTHING while his wife works a full time job, and does literally everything?? Dude and Rob are sitting around getting high doing jack squat around the house. OP kick them to the curb. YTA for putting your kids through this and for being so naive. But you do seem like your heart's in the right place but you are being used on multiple fronts, and your kids are suffering. They need to come first. Tell hubby and Rob to go get an apartment together \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8", "I\u2019m so disturbed.", "OP, you are NTA for wanting your home back, regardless of the reasons (which are completely understandable).\n\nWhy isn't your husband cooking and cleaning though, if he isn't working? What is he contributing to your lives? I understand that working a job may be impossible for him, but surely he should be doing tasks to keep the household functioning...?", "Can you call Rob's parents?  I think that you'd feel better about kicking Rob out if she had a place to go.  If you could tell them that Rob has overstayed his welcome, but you didn't want to kick his daughter out without giving her family a chance to take care of her.\n\nYou might see what's available for both or either of them by contacting whatever social services are available where you live.\n\nBut for your own and your children's health and sanity, please get them out.  You been extremely kind, but Rob doesn't seem to be trying to work out a plan for his own independent life.", "Call CPS. That girl needs to be in a foster or group home. It would be more stable than living with her homeless father. Or she can go back to her grandparents without leech dad. But kick them\nOut of your home.", "Tell him to send his daughter to live with his parents. Also if they can't afford to have a house of some sort how tf are they affording a dog? \n\nNTA but send them away and sit your husband down for a reality check.", "The thing is, your sons are probably suffering too with all the crap you've made them put up with and feel uncomfortable with. Their mum is awful too.", "Because if there are drugs or paraphernalia in the house and OP doesn\u2019t do anything about it, it could be considered child endangerment or neglect.", "And how come OPs husband is so insistent that they have to stay\u2026 maybe something creepy is going on there", "Homeless people often have dogs for emotional support, company and better begging. It's not unusual at all.", "There have been no drugs or drug paraphernalia this time. That was the first time he stayed with OP.", "Oh I know, trust me .\n\n\n But if you want to better your life and become financially stable you need to get your circumstances in order to start saving. I have my apartment but no pet as I can't afford one  and didn't have the time\n\n\n I would love to have a dog but as a grown up adult who is responsible since I am unable to care for said dog properly I don't get one.\n\nYou are right it's not unusual but it is irresponsible", "*No drugs or paraphernalia that OP has found", "I'm in complete agreement. If the pet gets sick, the pet just suffers. Pets are luxury and should be treated as such. You shouldn't have a pet if it's just to support you and you don't have the means to support its needs.", "The food I could afford the medical care is too expensive for me and it's unfair for the poor soul not to be able to help if an illness or something appears."]}
