My husband has ASD which makes it hard for him to maintain a job. This hasn't been a problem for me, as I make a decent wage and can afford a modest but decent life for our family of 4. \n\nIn 2020, my husband worked at a fast food restraunt for a couple months and met a homeless man, who he quickly became friends with. We'll call him Rob (42m). One cold night, Rob and his then girlfriend asked to stay with us for a while. We had a guest room, and though uncomfortable, I agreed. After a week, their nightly arguments between eachother and general household hygene were too much to bear, so I kicked them out. When they left, the guest room was trashed, and there were pills and needles everywhere. As a mother, this disturbed me, and I have never stopped being wary of Rob.\n\nFast forward to July 1st 2023- Our guest room has turned into a storage room, and it would take work to get it livable again. Rob has broken up with his girlfriend and has gotten custody of his daughter 15f from a different woman, and her 8 month old puppy. Rob was sick of living with his parents and burned bridges with them. My husband came to me panicked one evening asking me to go pick them up, because they have nowhere else to go. For context, only I drive. \n\nReluctantly I again agreed to host Rob, mostly because I can't stand his daughter, we'll call her Ann, being on the street. With the guest room out of comission, they take my elder son's room. Both sons have bunkbeds, so I figure it will be manageable temporarily.\n\nInitially, Rob promises to be out in a week, I knew it was a lie as he had no money and no plans, but I wasn't concerned that it would take longer. My sons are in online school, so he promises to be out by the time school starts 8/14, so my son can use his room for school. Another lie.\n\nLiving with these 2 has been awful. They don't pay rent, or do chores. Rob only works about 3 days a week. Ann eats all our expensive snack food and refuses to eat meals I cook. She ate 12 icecream cones in 3 days, my son's whole month of treats. Rob has ruined our yard, with cigarette butts and trash everywhere. Their dog has dug in multiple places, and they're not training him not to. My sons room is trashed by them, and they've broken dishes. They don't clean the sink after using it and they don't flush the the toilet. Living with them is driving me crazy. Ann is spoiled, but she is very sweet, and she is a child. I don't like Rob, but he says he has gotten sober.\n\nAt this point, I'm the only one who cleans, cooks and pays bills, and I can't do it for 2 extra people. I told my husband I want them gone before my son turns 15 in October. He said I'm being unreasonable. They have nowhere to go. I told him a shelter may have resources for them and I can't handle this any more. It is not my fault they're in this situation and I can't live like this, and I don't think my sons deserve this either.

Instead of answering each post I'm going to address them here. \n\nFirst- when it comes to the drugs, Rob swears they were his gf's, and he has been clean from alcohol and drugs for over a year. Once again, I don't know how accurate this is, but he doesn't scream at his daughter, or us, like he did at gf. In fact, other than complaining about work, he is very quiet and keeps his head down now, since he knows I don't like him.\n\nSecond- Cps is already involved. No court awarded Rob custody. Ann's mother abandoned her to him. He had to get CPS and the courts involved to get her into school, and to revoke the child support. Poor Ann is in an awful situation.\n\nWhich brings me to the third point- the ONLY reason I let them in is because of Ann and her puppy. I feel awful for her. Being spoiled and quietly rude(not cleaning, not flushing) doesn't feel like a reason to condemn HER. If it was just him, he never would've stepped foot in my house. Her grandparents are supposedly verbally abusive too, so that is not a good option for her unfortunately.\n\nAnd lastly, my husband has Autism. (ASD as stated above) It affects him every day, and tasks you and I take for granted are difficult for him. He helps our boys with their school, and does help with house chores when he is not overstimulated. It is a constant battle for him, but we have worked for years to improve his productivity. He works odd jobs and has a big heart. I do think he's being a bit of an ass about this, but i dont think he fully comprehended how the situation affects us either, or thinks because it affects Rob too, that somehow that gives him a pass.
