{"id": 26471, "submission_id": "16dimx3", "title": "AITA For kicking my husband's friend and his daughter out of my home knowing they have nowhere to go.", "selftext": "I 32f and my husband 32m live with our sons 12m and 14m and 3 cats. My husband has ASD which makes it hard for him to maintain a job. This hasn't been a problem for me, as I make a decent wage and can afford a modest but decent life for our family of 4. \n\nIn 2020, my husband worked at a fast food restraunt for a couple months and met a homeless man, who he quickly became friends with. We'll call him Rob (42m). One cold night, Rob and his then girlfriend asked to stay with us for a while. We had a guest room, and though uncomfortable, I agreed. After a week, their nightly arguments between eachother and general household hygene were too much to bear, so I kicked them out. When they left, the guest room was trashed, and there were pills and needles everywhere. As a mother, this disturbed me, and I have never stopped being wary of Rob.\n\nFast forward to July 1st 2023- Our guest room has turned into a storage room, and it would take work to get it livable again. Rob has broken up with his girlfriend and has gotten custody of his daughter 15f from a different woman, and her 8 month old puppy. Rob was sick of living with his parents and burned bridges with them. My husband came to me panicked one evening asking me to go pick them up, because they have nowhere else to go. For context, only I drive. \n\nReluctantly I again agreed to host Rob, mostly because I can't stand his daughter, we'll call her Ann, being on the street. With the guest room out of comission, they take my elder son's room. Both sons have bunkbeds, so I figure it will be manageable temporarily.\n\nInitially, Rob promises to be out in a week, I knew it was a lie as he had no money and no plans, but I wasn't concerned that it would take longer. My sons are in online school, so he promises to be out by the time school starts 8/14, so my son can use his room for school. Another lie.\n\nLiving with these 2 has been awful. They don't pay rent, or do chores. Rob only works about 3 days a week. Ann eats all our expensive snack food and refuses to eat meals I cook. She ate 12 icecream cones in 3 days, my son's whole month of treats. Rob has ruined our yard, with cigarette butts and trash everywhere. Their dog has dug in multiple places, and they're not training him not to. My sons room is trashed by them, and they've broken dishes. They don't clean the sink after using it and they don't flush the the toilet. Living with them is driving me crazy. Ann is spoiled, but she is very sweet, and she is a child. I don't like Rob, but he says he has gotten sober.\n\nAt this point, I'm the only one who cleans, cooks and pays bills, and I can't do it for 2 extra people. I told my husband I want them gone before my son turns 15 in October. He said I'm being unreasonable. They have nowhere to go. I told him a shelter may have resources for them and I can't handle this any more. It is not my fault they're in this situation and I can't live like this, and I don't think my sons deserve this either.

If everything you described is accurate please document it by taking pictures of the mess and drug paraphernalia. You mentioned needles and pills. Send the pictures and a detailed account of the situation to child services. You may not be the asshole but it sounds like your husband and his friend are.", "NTA, you home is your sanctuary and your safe, happy place.  Having Rob and his daughter there is disrupting your life, not to mention that they are not respecting your home.  Your husband needs to be more understanding. \n\nYes they don\u2019t have any place to go but they are not your responsibility.  They were initially supposed to be out by 8|14, they\u2019ve already overstayed their welcome.  You shouldn\u2019t have to give up your comfort and piece of mind to accommodate Rob.  I\u2019d kick them out ASAP before they can claim squatter rights.", "NTA, but why oh why allow this person in your home a second time, help your hubby understand he can't do this to your family anymore.  Your heart is big, but you must protect your family first.", "NTA!!! You cannot help people who refuse to help themselves. You also cannot be expected to house an extra family without them contributing and with them actively trashing your house. They aren\u2019t being respectful and are taking serious advantage of your kindness. Kick them out now, don\u2019t wait till October. It will only get worse", "October is much too long. Even now they've been there long enough that you may have to file an eviction action if they don't leave when you ask them to. They need to go now.", "NTA. What you could do is start contacting shelters and making sure there's proper room and the kid is gonna be fine, but you can't take care of everyone. There's a difference between helping someone out for a bit or taking care of them permanently.", "NTA. They could have helped themselves in any number of ways (the first being good house guests). You are not responsible for them, or their untrained puppy.", "NTA, you have been more than kind and they have repaid you by being the worst house guests they can be.\n\nI wouldn't even wait for October, I'll give them a week to leave...", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe Rob anything, you\u2019ve put him and his daughter up, fed them and they\u2019ve treated your home like trash. You\u2019ve given notice that they need to find somewhere else not just kicked them out with no warning. If Rob is working and can afford cigarettes he could be putting money aside. \n\nFor your own sanity don\u2019t let it carry on.", "NTA, obviously. Kick them out.", "NTA! Jesus Harold Christ. Your husband is so out of line here. You owe these people nothing. You've already gone far above & beyond taking in homeless strangers along with their drug problems, kids, bad hygiene, fighting and then eating you out of house and home. They don't help, you're supporting a bunch of freeloaders! WTF else are you supposed to do? You pay the bills, take care of the kids, your husband works P/T, and you are having essentially no say in your own home. Girl, stop asking your husband and get these beings out of your home, change the locks and be done with it. Again, you owe them nothing and you're putting your own kids at risk. How your husband doesn't see this is absolutely mind boggling. Smh. Get them out yesterday! NTA!", "NTA\n\nKick the ungrateful freeloaders to the curb.", "NTA and Y T A to yourself.... You also have a husband problem, why isn't he cooking and cleaning. You are a fool to let them back into the house and then act like a servant.", "NTA.  Dear lord.  NEEDLES IN YOUR HOUSE.  Lady, you have let a screaming, abusive intravenous drug user into your home WITH YOUR KIDS.  You could have cops busting down your door tomorrow.  You could be putting all of you in legal trouble.  You absolutely kick them out now.  You are being way more than nice.  You are doormat who is putting your family in danger.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Rob needs to get his act together and he won't with your husband letting him do whatever he wants like some bratty 6 year old.  It's tough 'love' time. Rob and his daughter need to go.

Kick them out TODAY and tell your husband if he's so worried about them he can leave too. Why are you making your son lose his room? Seriously, you're a shitty mom and you have a shitty husband. Grow a spine. Is this how you want your kids to live?", "The needles and pills were in the guest room the first time he stayed here. I didn't even know he had a daughter then. He claims they all belonged to the ex girlfriend. I'm not sure if I believe that, but I haven't seen any needles this time. Just trash and cigarettes", "You need to have them removed before social services comes and removes all the kids from the residence.
