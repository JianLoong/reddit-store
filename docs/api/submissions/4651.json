Your parents are exceedingly toxic for this.\n\nHowever, I am placing non-judgement blame on you for giving in to this. You are allowing this to be the precedent when you should be throwing a shitstorm bigger than hers. \n\nThat's the thing, parents like this are ultimately lazy and just don't want to have to listen to the bratty child anymore. They know you will give in easier (as you have), so they expect you to sacrifice. \n\nTake it back from your sister and/or throw a 16 year old, hormone-fueled tantrum. This will continue for the rest of your life if you continue to allow it. Demand your birthday money back, since they have essentially taken it and given it to her. \n\nYou can make life very difficult for them as a 16 year old. Clearly, your parents aren't going to be helping you much when you turn 18 anyway, so why make it easy for them to treat you this way?", "NTA.\n\nYour mother is extremely toxic and unfair in this case. She shouldn\u2019t have forced you to give up *YOUR* property!", "NTA, what's stopping your parents from asking you where you bought it so THEY can give her one? If they keep this up then your sister is gonna be the most selfish and entitled human being in your family and that will be all their fault.", "NTA.  There were many solutions to this problem.  It was not necessary to steal (why honey that is stealing) your phone.  They could buy him another or give you money for yours (if your sister got impatient) and buy you another.  They had a chance to negotiate or just be a good parent and teach your little sister that she can't have it all.  You could talk to them and point out how you feel, though sadly I doubt they'll listen to you.  From what you wrote, they sound like the classic parents who always want to be right.", "NTA but your Mother is a big AH. Your sister will be one too. Get out ASAP after Highschool", "NTA. They just made you give up your property to your sister cause she said she wanted it. You shouldn\u2019t have given in to it but they\u2019re your parents and I understand telling them no is probably hard. I would ask them to replace the phone they made you give up or take yours back.", "NTA- Don\u2019t be TA to yourself and go get your phone back. You didn\u2019t \u2018give\u2019 it to her, you were forced to give it up to her; two very different things. Your little sister is most likely going to forget about it in a week.", "NTA tell your mother she owes you your birthday money back, or your going to tell everyone that have you birthday money what happened.", "NTA    find the phone, and hide it. If your parents give her everything, hopefully they will get her a new one (which they should have done in the first place) then after she gets it you can 'suddenly' find yours.\n\nYour parents suck.", "NTA. So now you\u2019re 8 year old sister has a phone and you don\u2019t? I can see you going NC with your entire family as soon as you\u2019re able to. And your sister will be wondering why you hate her so much. No one should be forced to give away their belongings.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your parents phone to give away. Take it back and tell them to buy your sis her own phone.\n\nI'm petty enough to say if I can't have it no one will and smash it, cause you know it's mine I bought.", "Nta. If you think you cant take it back without them taking your actual phone, then act cool about it so they dont suspect anything and break it when theyre not looking. You dont even need to actually break it, just sink it in water. Youre welcome", "NTA \nForcing kids to give away their stuff is a common post here.  The parents are always the ass holes in this case.  \nI parents need to learn to say no sometimes to the whiny brats.", "Take back the phone.   If your parents blow a fuse let them know you will gladly give it to sister AFTER they reimburse you what you paid for it with YOUR money.  NTA", "NTA\n\nI'd say this one is a loss, but perhaps you can politely tell you parents the next time this happens that you'll provide the information to buy it if they want to get her (whatever is is that you have).\n\nIt's their responsibility to provide your sister what she wants, not yours.", "NTA\n\nInformation diet for the family, now. Your sister does not need to know your purchases. Do not talk about frequency of use, and deflect any questions about it. \n\nI would go find your online receipt and inform your parents it was not a gift for your sister and that is the cost they owe you. You did not willingly give it up and will see it as stolen until reimbursed", ">My parents said if I demand my phone back again they'll take away my actual phone and return it and I can just have a small phone\n\nThe problem is that they're seeing the phone as a phone (as in, you have two phones, give one to your sister). Tell them that's fine, but you need them to replace your birthday money. NTA", "NTA Here is what I would do, look them straight in the eye and say this. \n\nYou can push me around and make me do what you want. I'll smile and put up with the crap you put me through. Still you're not going to control me forever. I'll leave the house eventually and your little princess is going to learn that she won't always get what she wants.", "NTA. Send them the receipt for the phone and ask them how they want to pay for it.", "NTA. Take it when she\u2019s not paying attention and sell it. Then act like you don\u2019t know anything about what happened and she must have lost it.", "NTA, I don't know if it's still done or possible in this case but it used to be if you still had the box and receipt a phone store could and often would render the device inoperable/not allowed to connect to networks if you told them it was lost or stolen.\n\nI would go ask if this is possible.", "NTA, Isis and Princess huh? What a surprise that your parents should have poor judgement...", "This is abuse on your parents part. Get ready to go nc because this won't get better. If I were really petty, I would tell you to get the phone when no one is looking and flush it down the toilet then tell them you dont know where it is which would be true because you dont have the sewer system mapped.

That was your property purchased with your own money. I\u2019d take that phone back and hide it! Then claim little sister lost it! Have you any family members who can help talk to your parents about this blatant favouritism? I feel so bad for you and hope you have someone to take up your cause and fight in your corner for you. I would seriously consider hiding any items you buy from now on and not allow your sister to see them. Also, what they did was theft as you can prove this was bought with your own money. Therefore the police could be informed as a last resort? I hope you\u2019re ok. Sending lots of love \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Since they demanded you give it to her disable everything you downloaded then it's just a toy.", "Lol it\u2019s time to get evil sis. Fucking act out like a mother fucker. Show your parents why they should be more accommodating of a teenager than a barely past diapers child.", "NTA. But if I confronted my parents about something like this at your age they would\u2019ve taken away my actual phone like how your parents are threatening so I would probably let it go this time since you already gave in (ik it\u2019s annoying how we can give in sometimes when we don\u2019t want to but it happens) and just forgive yourself for giving in this time. Letting it go is important for your own piece of mind. Next time they try pulling something similar try standing your ground but you end up giving in again, forgive yourself and try again!", "NTA.\n\nWow. I have half a mind to say you should just reclaim the phone for yourself. You bought it, for yourself, with _birthday money_. The condition seemed to be if you don\u2019t want it - clearly you do. But that would be escalation. \n\nBut\u2026\n\nPart of the reason people act in this way is because they know that if they keep pushing and keep escalating eventually the other person will fold. If you stand your ground on it and force them to either escalate or fold, that might be the best way to stop this from happening again. It\u2019s the technique of the bully - they pick easy targets, so if you become more trouble than it\u2019s worth they\u2019ll back off. \n\nIt\u2019s your choice. I personally would escalate. But by no means are you an asshole here. Your sister sounds rather spoiled and that reflects badly on your parents right out the gate, never mind them having zero respect for your property and your LITERAL BIRTHDAY GIFT. It was bought with birthday money, that means it counts dammit. \n\nNot to be radical but also maybe consider having an escape plan ready. I hope it never comes to that but\u2026 :/", "Next time your sister asks this question, don't say no. Say, loudly, \"but I do want it\". \n\nRepeat every. Single. Time.", "NTA.

Her parents suck!", "Soyes mini phone", "Give your parents an invoice for the phone.", "agreed- and tell EVERYONE you and your awful parents know this story of theft, bullying and favouritism. and start making plans to leave when 18. sorry you have this problem.", "Thank you!! It\u2019s so cute! I could see why your sister would want one. Definitely not okay for your mom to call you selfish when you bought it for yourself with your own money. Would you be able to buy another one and give it to her for the holidays or her birthday?", "Rally your family around you to call your parents out for this. Tell your grandparents, cousins, friends, uncles, aunts, neighbors, whoever else to get them on your side and tell them how your parents took your birthday present and gave it to your sister. And how they're threatening you."]}
