Sorry. \ud83d\ude25\n\nBut If it was from someone other than your parents, like a grandparent or aunt, go somewhere private/away from your parents and call that person. Tell them that you used the nice gift of money they gave you to buy yourself a phone, but your parents took your new phone away and gave it to your little sister. Tell them you are sad that their gift to you got taken away. Tell them about other things taken, if this has happened before.
