He married a woman with a kid(s), he needs to play nice.", "My parents got divorced when I was a young child, and my father married a woman who didn\u2019t want kids. I hardly ever spent time with them because they had very busy lives. When I saw them she would hardly engage with me, and never tried to take an interest in my life. My father gave the same excuses about how she felt I was taking a place that belonged to her. \n\nWhen they had their own children she softened a little. It was like she realised I hadn\u2019t been an unholy, unruly monster with no table manners. I had been a normal five year old. But by the time this happened I was already a teenager, and not that interested in their approval.\n\nMy father had already seen what he had done to me by then. And although he was apologetic, there was no turning back. He was determined to do a better job for his other children, and due to how we didn\u2019t even live in the same country it was difficult to do both. He also wanted to respect his wifes wishes about what their family was.\n\nAll this resulted in what I would consider a very good relationship between two adults. We talk on a regular basis, and see each other a few times a year. He is proud of my accomplishments and supports me in my endeavours. He never criticises my plans, or tries to tell me what to do, because he knows he doesn\u2019t have that right. He is not a parental figure in my life. \n\nWe love and care about each other, but we don\u2019t impose. This relationship, although in some aspects a little sad, is a lot better then what I see many people have with their parents. My relationship with my mother (who didn\u2019t leave, and always showed up) is much more difficult because there is a lot of love, but not enough respect for each other\u2019s boundaries.\n\nI am sorry you are going through this. You are NTA! Take this opportunity to speak frankly with your mother. We are each responsible for taking charge of our own happiness and making our own priorities. \u201cYou are grateful for the room she will provide you with why you complete your studies.

I am just some stranger on the internet. What do I know!?!", "NTA, but ultimately your mom is an adult and she has the right to decide who to keep in her life, even if that makes you choose to keep your distance with her.   \nFor years I barely spoke with my mother, because she decided to stay with her abusive husband (the guy is my biological sperm donor but I can't bring myself to call \"father\" to a man who all he did is abuse me and never cared for me, even leaving me to starve if my mom had to leave the house for the whole day). Now I do have a relationship with my mom but I put firm boundaries that I won't move from: I won't enter her house that she shares with the abuser, she's not allowed to give the abuser my address or phone number, she's not allowed to talk to me about him, if she needs to vent she's welcome to start therapy which she refuses to do (she has the means to do it).  \nDoes it hurt that ultimately I know my mom is choosing, and her choice means that I need to stay away and not share so much time with her? Yes, it hurts.

And it's not out of line for the mother to want to have that conversation with her husband *before* he hears it from the grandparents or another random third party, or to want to have the conversation with him 1:1 and not with grandparents around. It directly and significantly impacts him and his life.\n\nLet's rephrase a similar scenario:\n\nAn adult family member needs a place to stay for several years - let's say it's  MIL. Lets say the MIL and DIL don't get along too well, but it's in a typical family dynamic way.\n\nIs it abusive or a \"red flag\" for the married couple to want to discuss taking in the MIL in private? Or for the son to want to wait to talk to his wife about it until she's available and in a reasonably good mood (not working, not busy with another task, not coming off a bad/stressful day)? Or for the son to want to have the conversation with his wife first before she hears of it from another family member? Would it be unreasonable of the wife to be upset if the first she hears of her MIL coming to **live with her** is from some other family member or friend who's removed from the situation? None of these things are unreasonable or red flags.", "She said she comes home to LIVE during summers, then says mom doesn\u2019t want her telling grandparents she\u2019s coming home. Nothing in that sentence implies that she\u2019s talking about a 2 hr visit with mom. It\u2019s not unreasonable to want to be the one to tell your husband your adult daughter is moving in for 3 months.", "What's the difference between saying my 26 year old friend wants to live with us rent free while studying and my 26 year old child wants to live with us rent free while studying? You're still asking your spouse to bring in another adult to their living arrangement", "Same to you, friend. And OP as well. Hopefully better days wait us all.", "Hell, a few years ago I was running around a park with my friend\u2019s niece.  She wanted a piggyback ride and we got a little too crazy and took a tumble.\n\nI scraped up my knee and leg pretty badly and have scars from it.\n\nBut literally as we were going down all I thought of was her - so I quick shifted her so she\u2019d land fully on me and then immediately turned over to grab her and make sure she was okay first.\n\nEven my partner as soon as we found out we were expecting was basically ready to roll me up in bubblewrap - I\u2019m a bit of a klutz.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine not protecting a child.", "I know the person who commented \"At least she didn't lie about protecting you\" didn't mean anything, but I don't see how that's any less hurtful. You shouldn't have had to go through that from your own mother (and father of course). So glad you made it out!", "But that particular sentence was referring to them coming to visit, not them coming to stay for years. OP had to refrain from telling their grandparents they were even visiting because mom's husband wouldn't like it. That's weird. It would be more understandable if it were referring to them coming to live with mom for their Masters, but for short visits this is strange.", "You\u2019re reading it wrong.  The op was warned not to tell grandparents about a VISIT.  Not that she was coming to stay indefinitely.", "Wasn\u2019t it a 3 month visit over the summer though?", "She said she would come home for summers that\u2019s more than a visit.", "You mean like many college students do, especially if they live on campus (which shuts down over summer)? And the way I read it it seemed like it was any time they visited during college.", "Granted, it\u2019s a long visit, but luckymacandcheese wanted to compare it to a stay of several years.  Clearly not even similar.", "I would still want to discuss  3 month stay with my husband before he found out from grandma, especially if I know he doesn\u2019t like to share his space. Being a shitty person doesn\u2019t automatically equal abuse."]}
