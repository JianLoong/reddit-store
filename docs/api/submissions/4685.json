They fell in love and decided to get engaged after dating for around a year, they have been married for some time now and I have during this time found out that Theodore does not really like me.\n\nThe last 5 years I have been studying far away from home and coming back to live at my moms house during the summers, and small remarks have been made during my stays. E.g my mom asking me not to say to my grandparents that I am coming home, because she wants Theodore to be in a good mood when she tells him, or my mom saying that it's hard for Theodore when I visit because he is not used to sharing his space.\n\nBasically he is not welcoming and I have told my mother this. \n\nThis all came to a boiling point this fall, when I considered applying for a master thesis were my mom lives. When I brought this up to my mom her response was to say that I would need to get an apartment instead of living with her (they have 3 extra rooms), which made me upset. So I tried to explain that it is hard to not feel welcomed and since that is the case I would simply not come to visit. \n\nMy mom became upset and said she had things to think over. Which she did and came back two weeks later saying that she was going to divorce him, she explain that it was time because he never wanted to do things, he never asked how she was doing and so on, and she told me to apply for the masters and stay with her.\n\nSo I did and I got the masters, I accepted it and started to plans to go home. But then she changed her mind when Theodore started doing the small things, like going out and doing things and basically the bare minimum. \n\nNow I am allowed to go home and stay with her and him for the masters, but honestly with all this stress I dont see it being worth it. \n\nAm I an asshole for expecting my mom to go through with the divorce and being cold towards her now?\n\nTDLR My mom said she was going to divorce her husband so I could come home and feel welcome, but now changed her mind because husband does good things that only affect her.", "created_utc": 1671007030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlls6j/aita_for_expecting_my_mom_to_get_a_divorce/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes he even told her. I left home at 15 because of that woman. I'm in my 30s now, and they're still married.", "NTA - You seem genuinely concerned, pretty annoyed, but your mother is grown. Just stay supportive. However, your mother needs to pay very close attention. The fact that he\u2019s doing the minimum to \u201ccheck the boxes\u201d of your mother\u2019s list of needs seems like he\u2019s in the hoovering and maybe (slight maybe) love-bombing stage.", "NTA but don\u2019t pressure your mother on this issue. She\u2019ll most likely suffer in the future but you can\u2019t change anything. Theodore is the asshole here, he\u2019s abusive, trying to prevent her from enjoying her time with you when you return home to be together.", "usually, a guy like that is only going to make a temporary effort and then things fall back to the way they were before. Frankly, it sounds like your mom doesn't have much of a spine either if she has trouble taking her kid's side when the new husband has problems out of the blue.\n\nHowever, given that he did suddenly start an effort, if only a small one, and if he does start being nice to you, it would be in poor taste to demand she continue going through with the divorce or bringing the subject up right now. however if he is still rude or hostile to you or he relapses you are well within your right to bring up the subject and your mother's inability to stand up for her child or herself. So NTA if you give it a single chance and he still isn't treating you or the mother right, or drops the considerate act.", "NTA. But I wouldn't move in and wouldn't visit for some time. He sounds like he is isolating her. When things get worse, she will ask you to move out.", "Jeez, what's with all the Y T A votes?\n\nNTA for being upset that your mother is choosing this immature and distant guy instead of you.  But, ya know, it does sound like she's aware of the issue and some attempt is being made. Why don't you move back into the house and try and make it work?  I mean you're 26, you can just move out if it's not working.", "ESH.

I\u2019m sure he figured that you\u2019re a grown ass adult and by the time you were 22 and done with college you\u2019d be gone. It\u2019s pretty cruel of you to want your mom to get a divorce just because you don\u2019t like him.

While he doesn't sound like the perfect guy and it doesn't sound like the two of you have a perfect relationship it's not your place to push her to the point where you \"expect\" her to divorce him given what we know so far.\n\nYou shouldn't be interfering in your mother's relationship when her grievances are over such minor things.", "YTA, you\u2019re an adult, it\u2019s not a must that you live with your mom. She does have a life outside of you.", "YTA. I get where you're coming from, but as you don't live with them currently, can you say with certainty it's the bare minimum? Maybe it's exactly the change your mother wanted to see in her husband. Will it last? Maybe, maybe not. Can you tell?\n\nTheodore is at last putting in effort, and maybe he is genuinely trying to change with the threat of divorce looming. I understand you don't trust his efforts, and maybe you are right. I would be critical as well.\n\nBut in the end, it is your mother's decision if she wants to give him another chance or not. Being cold towards her is no solution. If you don't want to stay with your mom (which is a possibility now), you should look for different accomodations.", "ESH.\n\nYou're a grown ass adult.  Figure your own living arrangement problems out.\n\nHowever,  your mom is being naive. When you're significant other has to \"be in a good mood\" to break the news of your child visiting,  that's a huge red flag.  Her loyalty should be to you over him.

Your entitled attitude would annoy most people.\n\n\\-consider that your mother is a person in her own right.
