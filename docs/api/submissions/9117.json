Is he actually serious? NTA.", "NTA. Tips, or gratuities, are little awards for good service, not something to be expected. \n\nYou did not receive good service", "INFO: you put in a $25(?) tip when ordering, and he then did all that, so you revoked it, correct?", "NTA. The size of the order doesn't affect him much anyway, it affects the restaurant.", "NTA at all. I\u2019d also complain about the order, you will get a refund.", "NTA\n\nHis job is to deliver it to the door of the address. That's what you paid for. He should have come up. Alright he took his chances and called you, but when he heard you were pregnant and then when he saw a woman literally about to give birth any day now struggling with heavy bags, then he certainly should have taken it up to the door.\n\nHe doesn't deserve a tip. He's not doing his job properly. I don't care how hard ubereats drivers have it. Don't take on a job if you're not willing to deliver it properly.", "YTA\n\nYou expected this guy to read your mind about what help you needed.  And you already took up a lot of his time by being slow to come down, and time is money, he might wind up fitting in fewer deliveries if he has to wait a long time for customers.\n\nThe way to deal with this is to say \"Could you please help me carry this upstairs?  I have cash for a tip in my apartment.\" When he does so, thank him enthusiastically, and tip him generously, in cash.", "NTA. Bringing the food up is literally the job of the delivery person.", "NTA\n\nI live on the 4th floor and routinely meet drivers in the lobby, because I can, because I have no reason not to, and because I don't want to risk them getting lost and wandering the building or accidentally leaving the food in front of the wrong unit.\n\nAnd I regularly tip 20+% even though I'm going downstairs.\n\nBut your circumstances are *different*, and you're not removing the tip because of the amount of work entailed, but rather that they didn't follow the instructions.\n\nIf this driver didn't want to follow the instructions, he should have rejected the order. (Or whatever it's called, for anyone who might want to argue, yes, I KNOW you can't see the instructions before you accept, but I've used every delivery app available, and they all have a way for the driver to drop the order once it's accepted. I know because I'll get a driver and 10 minutes before my food's meant to come I'll get no driver then a new one. Magic. I've had this discussion before, many times, and you're wrong.)\n\nAnyway, your reaction was completely justified. Just because people have a hard job does not give them a right to burden other people by *not doing the job*.\n\nNo pay, no work; but also, no work, no pay.\n\nI'm poor af, but I'm sure no one here would suggest you pay me for not delivering your food, lol. \n\n(Also why would he put the food on the floor if you're standing there? I meet the drivers and they, guess what? Hand me the bags of food. This is so weird.)", "NTA.  Your husband might be, for taking the driver\u2019s side and not yours, but you\u2019re fine.  You have the driver a $25 tip and he still just offloaded the order.\n\nCongrats, BTW.  Hope the baby is born healthy and that Dad helps with childcare.", "NTA - If the driver could not comply with the delivery instructions he should not have accepted the order.  No tip is reasonable for him completely not following the instructions\n\nETA: congrats on your pending new family member", "NTA no tip and a complaint is exactly the reaction this service deserved. Can you imagine if a restaurant served yelled at you across the room to say, \u201cwalk over here and pick up your refill\u201d? Would you too that waiter, too?", "YTA, Op. being pregnant has absolutely nothing to do with tipping the driver properly. Also, being pregnant doesn\u2019t mean the driver or anyone else needs to cater to you just because you\u2019re pregnant.", "Easy NTA. I believe in always tipping and rating well not just for exceptional service, but for simply not doing anything wrong. This driver did something wrong, and that was not actually fulfill the terms of the order. If that was a problem for him he should have declined it.", "NTA\n\nThe driver didn\u2019t do his job. He had specific instructions for delivery. He didn\u2019t follow instructions.

Congrats on your newest family member\u2019s arrival", "OP, I can sympathize with both sides.  I used to deliver UberEats and since you never know if you would get a tip or not until after the delivery was complete, I really can't blame the driver for not going all the way up to an 18th floor with a fuck-ton of food, do all that work for maybe $3 or $5 on tips (As people often and very regularly do).  BUT, I am also pregnant(24 weeks) so I really emphatize with you because it really sucks being all big, feeling tired, fatigued and so uncomfortable to do anything considered normal.  So, NTA.", "NTA - I did delivery for 4 years while I was in school and I\u2019d never do what that guy did and still expect a tip. He just wanted to leave faster", "NTA. I was going to say that I'd probably just reduce the tip amount instead of eliminating it because we have drivers that will just leave the food downstairs or lie and say the doorman wouldn't let them in. But then I read the details. He definitely didn't even deserve a reduced tip.", "NTA.  My brother delivers with ubereats, and it's very easy to tell how much tip is added to the order before you even accept it.  This guy would have known you left a big tip, and even knowing that he didn't help you.  He doesn't deserve that tip.", "I have to go with NTA, he didn't follow the simple instructions on the order and after he saw, you being heavily pregnant  he still didn't assist and in fact placed your food on the floor for you to pick up, which places him in the AH category.", "NTA - Tips are earned not just given....or at least this is the way it should be.", "YTA if it was in the US.  He brought the food to you.  Parking was probably difficult and he may have had other orders in the car.", "NTA. It's called a gratuity for a reason.", "Uber Eats and Door Dash delivery drivers are some of the most entitled people I've ever had the displeasure of interacting with. I can get past the fees when they send you a discount code every once in a while, but I've stopped using those apps mainly because of the drivers.", "NTA clear instructions were given. He failed to follow the instructions.", "YTA. These workers rely on tips. Give him a smaller amount but don\u2019t just not pay him. He still did labor.", "NTA. That\u2019s his job to bring it to your door. He was lazy. I wouldn\u2019t have tipped as well. It\u2019s extra bad because he saw you were very preggo and anyone with common sense would know to help a pregnant woman", "My partner will tell people in the order instructions \"cash tip if you bring it to my door\" and he'll give them $20 on a $40-50 order. Sometimes they still don't want to come up. Bummer for them.\n\n\nNTA", "ESH", "NTA it was a contactless delivery so either way he should have done what the order asked for, and you\u2019re pregnant, i just had my som at 7 months pregnant almost 8 and even at that point it was hard to do a lot of bending over/carrying heavy things plus multiple things so you\u2019re definitely not the AH here it was his job and he didnt do it and surely does not deserve 25$ for an order he didnt fulfill the askings of", "NTA. And if you still wanna try to start your Labour I recommend Korean food, it\u2019s spicier. If they have Kimchi Jeon (Kimchi pancakes) definitely order them, they are heavenly.", "NTA.

Or you'll have an elevator but it's always broken, so it's essentially the same thing.\n\nI've lived in a place like that, *once*, and it was so much hell, lol.\n\nBut again, irrelevant in this case, because there was an elevator!", "Then im not sure why op would even post then. The guy is obviously TA if he cant even go up an elevator. I assumed the only reason they posted was because they would of had to walk up 18 flights to make a delivery.", "It is infact the other way around. He accepted the drive because of the tip and didn't see the delivery instructions.", "Definitely happens, though I suspect less today than it did in the past. My mother was a day shy of starting her 44th week when she went into labor with my giant baby sister in the 80s.", "yea if i recall correctly my bio mother used to say i was like 10 and half months? something like that. i was overdue and it was concerning how long over i was", "I was due in March, wasn\u2019t born til mid April via emergency c-section. Weighed nearly 10lbs.", "Twins are usually early, not late - it's relatively rare for them to go to full term, even.", "Also Canadian- also agree. NTA, OP. You were planning on being VERY generous, and he left the job half done.", "This isn\u2019t a hotel, it\u2019s an apartment. Delivering the food means delivering to the door. And he was parked down the street.  He left his parked car to walk to the lobby. He just didn\u2019t want to come upstairs. In the time he waited for her to come down, he could have gone up.", "The only time a food delivery hasn't been brought to a hotel room door when I've ordered some is when the hotel elevator had to be activated by a room key.\n\nRegardless, this was an apartment building, not a hotel, and OP specifically put instructions in her order that the driver was to buzz in and come up to deliver the food to her door.", "He didn\u2019t complete the delivery. He put the food on the floor and left.", "He didn\u2019t follow the instructions he was lazy when there was clearly parking he is the asshole", "I do live in a big city too and most buildings have more than 1 elevator in cases of emergency. Heck, my building is only 6 floors and old af but still has an elevator", "My sister had her baby in 2020 and went to almost 42 weeks.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll let you go past 42 weeks now without inducing", "Oh shit, the more you know I guess. But concerning my comment, I was just joking, I remember seeing a meme once about someone thinking that people giving birth to twins would have to wait 18 months.", "So the food didn\u2019t get to the destination?", "Assholes still deserve wages.", "And that's true. Most do. \n\nMy point was simply that it's *possible* a building does not, because not *all* buildings do. Most cities have added regulations requiring elevators through some period or another, but not all have, and their are some even in those cities with exemptions. \n\nAnd yknow... some are supposed to, but slums, lol. \n\nAgain, wasn't arguing the point, which is moot, because there was an elevator, but also sharing the knowledge that this is not universal.", "No it didn\u2019t. It was left in the lobby and not dropped off at OPs apartment (which is the actual destination) when I lived in an apartment I never had drivers leave it in the lobby, much less on the floor."]}
