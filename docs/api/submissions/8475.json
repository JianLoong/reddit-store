{"id": 8475, "submission_id": "10mzjju", "title": "AITA for wanting to leave my Father and Brother to live my own life?", "selftext": " \n\nI'm 35 M, and been living with my disabled father and special needs brother since around 18 years old.  \nI originally moved in with just my Father, who was still working at the time, and my Grandmother.  \nMy brother moved in later, and is very heavily autistic. I was quite a lazy kid at the time, and didn't do too much around the house, and just buried myself in games.  \nI tried going out on my own, and just simply wasn't prepared. No vehicle, no real education no plan, and it barely lasted a year, till I came home. They were ecstatic to see me, but I just felt like a failure.\n\nI have always since then tried to do what I can to help around the house, from cooking, cleaning, laundry anything. This took a sharp turn in 2019 where my Grandmother passed away, and instead of my Father being remorseful, he just wanted me to start working and selling things to make ends meet, even at one point saying it was 'my fault' because I was the one who found her. She died in her sleep and was 88 years old.\n\nI said \"Okay, fair.\" and sold many of the things I owned, including working a full time job to help ends meet. My brother on the other hand has always been handed everything, as my father feels 'guilty' because of how he was born. To this day, my brother does little more than sit at his computer, eat, and sleep. He is nearly 30, and weighs almost 500 pounds.\n\nCovid happened, and suddenly I was out of a job that gave me a little freedom. Feel like a failure again. Estranged mother calls me up out of the blue (I hadn't talked to her in almost 10 years at this point), and has a huge change of heart, wants to help me and my brother. Our car broke down, she let us use her other car, and even helped me go to school online instead of just looking for another job. Father was upset about the school at first but 'allowed it', even though my Mother has basically paid for every cent.\n\nFast forward to today. I graduate with honors in 3 months, at the top of my class, which is something I never thought I would see myself do, as I struggled so hard with high school. My Father has fallen in on himself, refuses to do much more than bag up his own trash, is up for only maybe 3-4 hours at a time before napping for 2-4 hours. My Brother is entirely useless in terms of house, has to be fed, washed, and does nothing but sit as his computer. When asked to just help, not run a marathon, he starts crying and my Father immediately changes subject.\n\nI have someone I love in my life, who I want to be with. I have a career I want to pursue. My Father tells me I will be ruining him and my Brother if I leave, but I feel I've paid back my laziness as a kid, and that was 15 years ago. I still hurt and feel conflicted, which I don't know if it's wrong or not.", "created_utc": 1674862054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mzjju/aita_for_wanting_to_leave_my_father_and_brother/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
