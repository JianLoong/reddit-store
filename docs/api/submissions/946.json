He\u2019ll never spend time with them alone again, but that\u2019s not the subject of this point. My parents, thankfully, elected to bring him to the vet hospital and perform orthopedic surgery to repair my puppy\u2019s back leg. It was a pretty severe break, the femur was sticking out apparently. \n\nSo anyway, he had a successful surgery 8 days ago. Thank god. He\u2019s got a bunch of staples, as opposed to stitches, to seal the incision which is a pretty substantial cut all the way down his hind leg. The surgeon said to bring him back in 14 days after surgery to have the staples removed. \n\nWell, my girlfriend\u2019s mom is a nurse-practitioner and she literally ALWAYS has medical advice and ALWAYS undermines whatever any medical professional says. I love her, honestly, but in this regard she does annoy me slightly. She recommended that we save some money and take the staples out ourselves (the operating doctor would do it for free, but that\u2019s 3 hours from where my gf and I live). \n\nShe sent us medical grade staple removers and I\u2019m comfortable removing them myself. However, this morning my gf suggested that we take the staples out early. The reason, she says, is because her mom insists that she can tell when an incision is fully healed or not. According to her mom, we could get away with removing them 7-10 days after surgery and that the surgeon was just being extra safe. \n\nAm I the asshole for refusing and insisting that my puppy keep the staples in for the full 14 days? I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s more comfortable with them out. I want him fully healed and I want to be as safe as possible with regard to his medical decisions.\n\nEdit: I appreciate all the medical advice, but I came here for moral deliberation. I\u2019ve spoken to the operating vet and he said we were more than fine taking the staples out ourselves and that his appointment 4 weeks post-op is for his check up. The vet told me just a tech would remove the staples.", "created_utc": 1667410174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykbdv9/aita_for_not_letting_my_girlfriend_remove_my_dogs/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being a nurse-practitioner does not make her an expert in veterinary medicine. **The follow up with the vet is not just to remove staples. It is also to assess your puppy\u2019s overall recovery, which includes more than just the incision.** Your girlfriend is just as bad for going along with her mom. \n\nFrankly, I wouldn\u2019t let them anywhere near the puppy. These are the type of people who would remove the staples against your wishes and then say \u201cit\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Just so there\u2019s no mistake- they really suck.\n\nEdit to emphasize the important part.", "I'm so glad your little boy is ok!!! \n\nDon't let gf near him.

Humans and animals are two completely different things which is why vets go to school for considerably longer. Tell your gf and her mom to go Fuck themselves. Do what the vet recommends. They know more than some Nurse Practitioner.", "NTA  gf and her mom aren't veterinarians, and you shouldn't listen to them.\nLEAVE THE STAPLES ALONE UNTIL THE VET VISIT", "NTA.  I don't care what her mother does for a living, you follow the instructions of the vet who performed the surgery.  It's that simple.", "NTA. Let's follow the advice of the DOCTOR, shall we?", "NTA and honestly I wouldn't use the staple remover either. You might want to evaluate if you really want to go through life with so called experts back seating any medical situations you run into.", "NTA - Listen to the trained veterinary professional. Why would the vet tell you to the leave staples in for 14 days if that wasn't necessary? They will remove them for free either way. So what if the surgeon is just being extra safe? What is wrong with that? \n\nIt sounds like your GF's mom cares more about being the authority on all things medical than she does about your pup's health. She has not given a single medical reason in favor of taking the staples out early, just said that you could \"get away with\" taking them out now. \n\nIs pup a bit uncomfortable with the staples in? Possibly. But that may actually be a good thing as it will keep him from getting overactive while he is still healing. Unlike a human who understands the need to take it easy while they heal, dogs are gonna dog. \n\nFollow whatever instructions your vet gave for keeping the incision and staples clean and keep an eye out for any type of infection (swelling, redness, new tenderness around the incision, etc.). I know its a lot to drive 3 hours there an back to have the staples taken out, but it also gives the vet the opportunity to check how your pup is healing and provide any additional follow up instructions.", "NTA, take them out yourself is not big deal. DO NOT DO IT EARLY.  The incision can open or tear. No I am not a medical professional. I did take out my own stitches instead of going to the doctor. I waited one extra day. My incision came open. Depends on the person or animal. I did butterfly it and it has a much larger scar.", "NTA - And hide those staple removers or I feel like you might return home and find out that it was done while you were out", "NTA, just to add to the chorus, your GF's mum is *not a vet*, and animal treatment does not map 1:1 onto humans. \n\nYou need to follow the animal doctor's advice re: the treatment of your animal, and this should be very simple for both your GF and her mother to understand and appreciate. If not... well, you need to think seriously about this relationship.", "The reason they used metal sutures is because they want his mouth off the wound. Do not remove them early. Hair will grow in and you will not see scar.\nSource-worked for Veterinarians since 1978", "NTA human and animal healing times are different. Animal staples are kept in longer as animal don't have the ability to modify their activities after an injury like humans can, so they don't really understand that they can't move around like normal or they run the risk of bursting their stitches \n\n*Edit spelling*", "NTA.\n\nThe lasy is a nurse, not a vet.", "NTA.

What on earth will you do if the incision gets infected?\n\nThe vet will calm your pup, may be something to make him docile and he won't associate you with pain/ stress like he might if you pull them out.\n\nEven if it's a long drive, let the professionals do it in a sterile environment.", "NTA. She\u2019s *probably* right that the vet is being safe. Be safe. Follow the vet\u2019s advice.", "NTA,\n\nUnlike humans.  There is one thing a dog cannot do.  Tell you in words what is wrong with them or how much it hurts.  A nurse practitioner is still a nurse, not a doctor or a veterinarian. \n\nAll doctors are extra safe due to ethics and don't want to be sued.", "Even if your gf's mom was a vet (which she's not), she's not the one who examined the injury, performed the surgery, or put the staples in. Perhaps the vet saw something at the time that led them to decide to keep the staples in longer than usual. Perhaps not. \n\nEither way, gf's mom wasn't there and can only guess for the reasons behind the vet's orders. A nurse treating humans is not a doctor treating animals. Do not let anyone else near your puppy's incision, and follow the vet's orders.\n\nEdit: forgot my judgement, NTA", "I\u2019m a nurse and I highly recommend doing everything through the vet and do not touch the staples. Human skin and dogs are not the same. The vet might numb the area before removing the staples etc.", "NTA, I would follow the vet here. I'm medically educated myself, but also in humane medicine. I don't have a clue if the healing of wounds in dogs is based on the same physiological processes, if there is anything different compared to humans and if the staples can be taken out after 10 days. I just don't know it, I'm just a rad tech not a vet. The vet is the expert here, not the nurse practioner. I would trust her advice when she would work in veterinary medicine, but I don't think she does.", "NTA. The vet said 14 days. Follow their advice. And let a vet take out those staples - don't do it yourself. Sheesh.", "NOT THE ASSHOLE.\n\n\nAlways give more credit to what a Vet says, when Animals concerned, instead of a nurse-practicioner. Your dog is not a human, therefor a nurse for humans gets no say over a Vet.\n\nEven if it was a human, Who needed staples removed, I would most definetly take orders from the doctor itself, than nurse.

The surgeon is being \"extra safe\" so you can ignore his/her recommendations?\nLook her in the eye and say, \"what makes you think I *dont* want to be extra safe??\"\nIt's your doggo.

Our old vet would have told me it's fine to save a trip and take them out myself.", "NTA it's likely true that the vet is trying to be safe, but I'm not sure why you wouldn't want to be safe with your dog", "***\"...surgeon was just being extra safe.\"***\n\nAnd her point is? What's the problem with being \"extra safe\"?  Is leaving the staples in that little bit of extra time causing your girlfriend's mom some kind of discomfort, trauma, consternation, or inconvenience?  Obviously, not, and she's welcome to stay in her own lane about the puppy.\n\nLeave them in.\n\nNTA.", "Nta.\nDon't let them take the staples out! People and animals are different", "NTA, a surgeon removed mine earlier than recommended and the cut opened within 4h.

Make it clear that she is not permitted to manage your healthcare or your animal's healthcare unless you ask.  You will consult with professionals in the field of expertise.

I had a load of steel sheet on the trailer that was loaded with a cable sling. The sling was stuck and I gave it a big pull and my wrist went right through a sheet. Skin and facia was cut through, I could see the blood vessel which had a nick in it. Nerves looked like carpet thread. But overall nothing serious. Anyway the skin opened up like in a football shape. Warehouse people drove me to a urgent care facility and they gave me 7 stitches. Told me to come back in I think 6 weeks to get them removed (could have been 4, I don't remember). \n\nWell that was 2 hours from my house, I'm not driving back there so after 6 weeks I get some scissors and remove the stitches. After putting just a little bit of pulling pressure on it the thing split right back open. I called the place up and told them what happened and their response was they were only going to remove half the stiches. What the hell?! Anyway I got some butterfly bandages and spent weeks holding my wrist with my hand folded in and it eventually healed.\n\nWhile I'm all for removing them yourself, and waiting for the exact day the vet told you to wait until, 14 days seems quick to me. Verify with the vet he wasn't going to remove half the staples. Though the explanation they tried to sell me that it would reduce scarring seems like a non issue with a dog.", "Yup - scrolled to see this mentioned. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not just the removal of the staples but that they\u2019ll want to assess his recovery and see how he\u2019s doing and if there\u2019s anything abnormal.

Our patients can\u2019t tell us what\u2019s wrong so we need a bit more diagnostics to know what\u2019s wrong with your pet. Our patients get anxious, scared, fearful and **will bite/scratch you**,  which is far less common in human medicine.
