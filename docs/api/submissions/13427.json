She has already done damage to them and it can only go downhill.", "YWNBTA, I do suggest that if you do decide to let her back in, to add stipulations such as getting sober, and showing proof that she is working on her sobriety.", "NTA. Addiction is a horrible illness & people deserve support & chances, but you need to look after yourself & your family first.\nMaybe let her know any ways that you are able to support her, but hard no to her staying again.", "NTA, she\u2019s a risk to your well-being and STEALS from your child. She should have thought about her decisions a long time ago. Her boys also don\u2019t need to be around someone so inconsistent in their lives. She needs to grow up and get her shit together.

You've already been very patient with her until this point, which is a testament to your empathy towards her. However, it's absolutely valid to not want to go through that trauma again, especially when you've already helped her so much.

Make it very clear to her that you are not going to help her anymore because she won't help herself and actually get *and* stay sober. Perhaps she needs to talk to her ex about it, see if he'll have a fit of compassion and let her see the kids one last time, tell them she loves them, etc. I doubt it, but like you said the stress this is going to give you is the last thing you need. There are plenty of addicts out there who will never become sober _**because they don't want to**_, and no one can \"make\" them become sober. SIL needs to *want* to get better, or she will in fact die of her alcoholism. Thankfully, that's not your problem.\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA - everyone has boundaries. Stick to them. Shame on your husband for even considering after all she has put you through. Addiction is hard, yes, but you are not obligated to house her. Heal your own wounds. Put yourself and your family first.", "NTA. Her lifestyle choices and consequences are not your problem. Yes, alcoholism is a disease, but you do not neef her in your home. It's great that your husband is compassionate and wants to help her, but at the cost of disrupting your peace, Having an extra person in your home is disruptive enough, much less an ill person. Say no and don't turn back.", "op=NTA\n\nyour husband is part of the problem here.  He's willing to make you her caretaker.\n\nDon't DO IT! DON'T!! she's stolen from your child.  She's threatened you(by appearing to fight you).  She needs to find another place to stay.\n\nAnd if you've been helping her ex with HER children for the last two years, you do NOT lack empathy(your husband lacks backbone).  You have empathy for the real victims of her addiction--her kids.", "NTA - you have the responsibility to protect your family and even her children from her.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do it. Years of working in CPS and I saw so many kids removed from their actual parents\u2019 home because they had a hot mess of a relative living there that brought drugs, violent boyfriends and other drama into the home. You are entitled to peace in your own home!", "Unfortunately with addicts, there\u2019s no helping them, they have to help themselves. The old saying is \u201cnever trust a junkie\u201d, and it\u2019s very true. \n\nIMO, it\u2019s just going to be the same old song and dance, until she gets into a rehab program and actually TRIES to clean up. Everyone deserves a second chance, BUT they need to put in the work and EARN it.", "NTA\n\nShe should go to a halfway house.

The liver begins to shut down on a bad bender, so she very well might have been dying *at that time*. However, she might also live a long life if she stays sober. That's up to her. You've done your bit for her. Perhaps you might host occasional family dinners with her kids there, provide opportunities for them to bond, without letting her move back in.", "I find this difficult, I'm sympathetic to you both. May I suggest a middle of the road? If you truly believe her claims that she's been sober for the past 6 months then talk to the boys and their father to see if the boys even want to see her again.", "She never went into detail on if she is currently dying. All she said is that she was close to it in the hospital. This has been a roller-coaster of her saying she's dying to she's doing so much better.", "And you're definitely NTA!", "One of the boys is 14 and done. He said he's seen and dealt with too much. The other is 10 and remembers enough, but is a mama's boy. Their dad wants nothing to do with her after what she put them through. He has full custody and reserves the right to deny access if he feels she's a danger. I don't get involved in that part because that is not my business. I try to stay neutral when it comes to that. 6 months is better than she was before, but not enough for me. Plus, her medical problems are a lot and seem stressful. My MIL is kicking her out next month.", "If she's truly dying--she should seek a hospice program.
