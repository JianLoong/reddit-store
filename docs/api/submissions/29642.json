It sounds like she communicated INCREDIBLY poorly - or really not at all, which was super childish and selfish of her. It's hard to say from this exactly what the significance of that event was but it's hard to picture practically any work event that, with sufficient notice, couldn't be manned by someone else due to an important personal event.

It seems she wasn't as important at work as she thought she was.", "NTA. She had many other choices besides leaving in a huff, not talking to you about any of this, and whining to everyone else about it. Your sister sounds like she's 12 rather than 42. \n\nShe should have talked to you privately and directly. If you still decided not to move it, she could have declined. I would understand if she was upset at this point because you're basically telling her that you don't care if she attends or not, but that's still your choice. \n\nAnd if the conference wasn't that important to her career, she should have tried to ask for it off much sooner and not created all this drama.", "NTA.

Sure, maybe she could have skipped it, but a lot of work conferences are integral to people\u2019s careers.  Yes, if pushed, you can skip it, but that can potentially impact your progress at work.

I'm assuming you told her well ahead of time like people normally do when planning a wedding? I don't get your parents reaction at all since weddings are definitely more important than work conferences. And she got the day off anyway? Your family sounds pretty toxic given what you've noted here. Hopefully your in-laws are cool. You can spend time with them instead.", "NTA. Relatives are biology, family is a choice.

If they really needed her they would have said no.\n\nThis is your wedding, you had a specific  date that meant something to you but she wants it changed for work.  So what if you changed the date for her and this work event got rescheduled?  Would you be expected to change the date again? \n\n Rather than be a mature adult your sister walks out and then tells your mom and others?  She should have spoken to you, accepted you wouldn't change it, ask work for the day off or not attend if it wasn't possible.

You deserve to have a happy wedding and don't need that negativity.", "NTA at all. It's your day, not hers.  \n\n\nI work a job where sometimes I absolutely cannot miss certain things (like conferences where I give presentations). I would definitely be upset if I found out my sibling's wedding conflicted with something like that. In fact, something like this recently happened with a stepsibling.  \n\n\nWhat I didn't do, however, is get upset at my stepsibling. I didn't silently throw a fit and walk out of the room. I simply mentioned I had a conflicting situation that I could not get out of, gave a meaningful apology, and bought them a present off of the registry.  \n\n\nWhat an absolutely infantile way to respond to this. I can certainly understand the wave of upset washing over a person when they realize they can't make something this important, but the last person you take that out on is the person whose wedding it is.", "NTA.  It's your wedding, you pick any day you want.  People don't like it, they don't have to come.  What your sister did was extremely rude and tacky.  She tried to make it all about her, when it's all about you and your fianc\u00e9.  I guess her work was able to spare her, and they wouldn't crumble without her.  Why the hell were your parents getting involved?", "NTA & congratulations I smiled when I saw you were getting married on my birthday!! September 23rd is a special day!", "Nta so sister basically admitted work was more important than your wedding and she can get the day off.  So you have the right to think your wedding  is more important than your sister taking a day or a few hours off work. Uninvited her.  Then she can do what is important to her and so can you.service", "Ah, she has main character syndrome. \nNTA", "NTA\n\nBy chance have your parents always pandered to your sister and her moods?

And given how she acted, I get why.", "NTA \n\nSo....  to confirm....  After all that manipulative bullshit and her talking to everyone EXCEPT you, it turns out her boss was like \"sure, no problem!\" when she FINALLY got around to just asking for the day off??

So we had no idea she had something that day!! Thanks for the advice!!!", "If it was a conference of some sort, it could definitely be as those can be the size of weddings and larger, held at conference centers with 100s or more attendees, blocks of hotel rooms, speakers / itineraries, registration and check-in procedures, catering and entertainment all part of the event. If OP's sister was responsible for planning the event, she would probably feel especially committed. \n\nSTILL, that doesn't excuse her ridiculously childish behavior and poor communication. I agree OP is NTA.", "My mom sits on the board of a large organization and they plan their conferences four years out. Each conference is in a different country. So for example at last year's conference, they selected the conference location and rough month for 2024 and 2026.

By the time one wraps, we usually have an idea when next year's takes place.", "Kind of figured that just by the details you gave. I\u2019ve never understated entitled family members.

Obvious who is the golden child though.", "There\u2019s always two sides and we only got one here. It sounds to me you both have communication issues. Maybe the whole family does. We don\u2019t know why it really was important to your sis to be at work on that day.  Only assumptions. When your sis walked out and shut down did you attempt to talk to her? To see what was going on? And I don\u2019t see what the big deal is to change the date even though that date had meaning.  Sometimes we hang on to small things even though it may further dampen a family relationship when it would be so much easier to just change the date. Maybe your sis is emotional about you getting married and can\u2019t express herself. Family IS important and sometimes we need to show we can step down even tho we are right and they are  wrong. You\u2019d be surprised how that can resolve tension between two ppl and just make things nicer. Sometimes we need to give in and let go to show someone we love and care about them no matter what.  you\u2019re sis might a spoiled brat like some ppl here assume, we don\u2019t know. This was a good opportunity for you to show her unconditional love. It would have been a good one. I don\u2019t know if you have other siblings but there\u2019s nothing like sibling connection.

My mom came to me saying I needed to move our wedding date because my sister had a work conference that day and wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. >*\n\nINFO : Is your sister 42 or 4? \n\nPretty childish to walk out of the room, blatantly ignore you, and then have your mother talk to you instead of communicating herself like a real adult would do.\n\nKnowing someone that childish NOT ATTENDING your wedding is a nice early wedding gift.\n\nNTA\n\nEnjoy your wedding.", "NTA.  An even more ridiculous request than the pregnant friend one.", "NTA Your sister sounds rather spoiled.", "Just think you the savings from not having relatives there. If your family cannot be happy for you and be supportive, forget them.", ">My parents are disappointed because I wouldn\u2019t move my wedding date.\n\n\"Mom, dad.  I'm sorry you'll need to be at the conference.  We understand and we will be thinking of you.  We'll send you photos and the video of the service.  I hope all goes well.\"  /s\n\nNTA.", "NTA that's incredibly toxic, sorry OP.", "NTA.Sister\u2019s behavior is uncalled for & very childish.I get being upset abt it,but ignoring someone for that ling & NOT talk abt it to OP at all is crazy af.Sister & family are assholes.", "NTA of course. It is your wedding. You get to decide when it is. Then other people get to decide whether they can make it or not.", "NTA. My god. When did everyone get so entitled to think they can demand someone else change the wedding date because of them! Unless you are the bride , groom or the venue, the date stays.", "NTA. She could have simply, when you said the date, or even when you got engaged, mention that she would have this meeting and ask you to consider not having the wedding on the day of. Or simply saying she has this planned and is an important career move so she would not be able to attend your wedding.", "NTA. Sounds like Big Sis has a main character problem and wants to be the most important person in the room. She should stick to smaller rooms. Ignore her, don't ask her to do ANYTHING for your wedding, and have a great day.", "NTA - Your family sucks.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI suspect this isn't about the date, but the fact you are happy and getting married.", "Nta it's your wedding if she can't make it that's her problem", "NTA\n\nSo the world revolves around your sister? Because, obviously your sister felt her work thing was more important. Too bad you didn't invite her boss instead.", "Oh no she couldn\u2019t do that because then the family would be jumping on her about putting work first before \u201cfamily\u201d", "I feel like the sister is golden child and spoiled brat/Drama lama who always needs to be the main character and mommy and daddy let it happen", "Bridge shaped matchboxes.", "Week?   Same day, they know she's not coming back after all.", "my thing is, she asked off 1 month before AND was still able to get the time off??? my thought is the \u201cconference\u201d was probably some vacation for work meetings the sister just didn\u2019t want to miss out on and the \u201cconference\u201d itself wasn\u2019t all that important. She could\u2019ve probably asked for it off in February when she found out about the wedding and gotten the time off as well and it would\u2019ve been fine. But walking out of the room and ignoring OP for DAYS without even the SLIGHTEST reason why? Very childish and definitely an underlying reason more than \u201can important work conference she can\u2019t miss\u201d", "She values work more than her boss does. And given how they didn't even hesitate to give her the day off, I'm guessing she knew she could easily get the time approved, she just wanted her pity party.", "Succeeded.", "> What kind of \"work meeting\" is planned 8 months in advance?\n\nI work for a financial services company and occasionally get involved with event planning. And \u201cwhat events\u201d indeed? Oh my sweet summer child. We plan those things considerably more than 8 months out.\n\nOr consider sporting events? Your local sportsball \u201ccup final\u201d or other similar prestigious sporting event- planned years in advance. Or religious events- my stepson works for a church and we know when Christmas will be *years* in advance, and that he\u2019ll be expected to work on the day.\n\nLots of examples\u2026", "There's no such thing as unconditional love. And the rest of your comment is all that turn the other cheek stuff thats outdated.", "Yep, OP's sister is absolutely a drama queen, she couldn't even tell OP the issue she just left and then ignored her. Sounds like the rest of the family usually gives into sister's ridiculousness and now everyone's angry at OP for standing up for herself", "They\u2019d take a few days drafting the job description", "That was my thinking or at least taking place somewhere nice. \n\nWhat kind of 40 something adult stomps out of the room without saying anything when the other person has no way of knowing what upset them?"]}
