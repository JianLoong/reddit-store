If she really can't miss it, then sucks to suck I guess. Her reaction was completely uncalled for too. Why didn't she just talk to you instead of going through your mum. I don't normally suggest cutting contact with such little info, but honestly you may want to revaluate your relationship with your sister...", "NTA. Just cut off every toxic person. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around your sister. Your wedding doesn\u2019t either. It\u2019s her fault for not asking off in time.", "NTA. If your sister died her boss would advertise her job within a week. Families take rather longer to heal. Family trumps work everytime. \n\nAny chance of model bridges as wedding favours?", "Well, at least you know now that your sister and parents value a work meeting more than a marriage in the family. \n\nNTA. \n\nCan't imagine your sister will be on her deathbed regretting that one work conference she missed. But apparently she will be.", "NTA. Your sister is trying to make your wedding about her.", "NTA - this is an incredibly toxic family and it\u2019s really problematic how your mom instantly backed up your sister. Sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA I think your sister is a main character and any date you picked to get married would be problematic. It's a pity your family is feeding off your sister's selfmade drama because you deserve better.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your date... end of story!\n\nThere are countless way to approach a wedding...  one is to pick the most important date for you, one is to accommodate everyone's schedules to maximize involvement, as well as countless countless other options.   Its YOUR wedding, there is no wrong answer, only what best fits your priorities.    If September 23rd is priority #1, then so be it!\n\nI still feel we could benefit from some more info...  Maybe I'm reading beyond what is stated too much, but your sister is mad *at you*?... or just upset at having *to choose*?    Either way, she chose you, so there is that.\n\nI'm also curious, was the request by your parents to change dates endorsed by your sister, or is that you parents just trying to play peacekeeper without your sister's knowledge (and possibly making things worse)?", "INFO: did she mention this date or event at all before you picked Sept 23? Was she angry because she thought you knew she wouldn't be able to go that day? If so, I'd still say NTA -  your wedding, your choices. But I'm wondering why she just walked out of the room", "NTA\n\nWhat a trip your sister and family are.  Instead of just asking if she could get out of the work event (giving about 7 months notice), she says no and gets everyone worked up AND THEN when she asks, it's not a problem?  You are not going to get any apologies from these people, but you should.  Congrats on the wedding (or is it congrats on your 1 month anniversary?)", "NTA.

Especially because it sounds like you gave plenty of notice for when your wedding was going to be. I'm thinking maybe there's more to what's going on with her then you not moving your wedding to a different date.

Even that far in advance, it was almost impossible to find a date that didn\u2019t fall on someone\u2019s birthday or anniversary or conflict with some relative\u2019s schedule in some way. You\u2019ve just gotta find a date and let people work around it or opt out, and it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t give her notice.\n\nIt sounds like she dug her heels in early and is more mad that you didn\u2019t bend to her wishes than she is about the actual scheduling conflict, which didn\u2019t even end up mattering.", "def NTA.

It\u2019s very difficult to change once things are in motion. \n\nHas your sister insisted on being the main character at any other of your major events?", "NTA...I sincerely hope that your family members are not always this ridiculous.  Enjoy your wedding on the day of your choice and have zero regrets.  In the meantime let your family know to keep their feedback to themselves.", "NTA - this day is about you and your finance. Period. In one year, three years, five years, it isn't going to matter if she was there for the wedding or not. I feel like people over romanticize weddings, especially when it ultimately has nothing to do with them. Stick to your guns, and do what you want to do.", "NTA. It sounds like she communicated INCREDIBLY poorly - or really not at all, which was super childish and selfish of her. It's hard to say from this exactly what the significance of that event was but it's hard to picture practically any work event that, with sufficient notice, couldn't be manned by someone else due to an important personal event. And ultimately it sounds like it was pretty much a non-issue for her to miss it which suggests the level of importance with which she wanted it to be treated - when you didn't even KNOW about it to begin with - was overblown.", "NTA\n\nYour sister caused a fuss instead of asking for the time off. It seems she wasn't as important at work as she thought she was.", "NTA. She had many other choices besides leaving in a huff, not talking to you about any of this, and whining to everyone else about it. Your sister sounds like she's 12 rather than 42. \n\nShe should have talked to you privately and directly. If you still decided not to move it, she could have declined. I would understand if she was upset at this point because you're basically telling her that you don't care if she attends or not, but that's still your choice. \n\nAnd if the conference wasn't that important to her career, she should have tried to ask for it off much sooner and not created all this drama.", "NTA. It sounds like her not going to the work thing wasn\u2019t even a big deal to her boss in the end, so she\u2019s the one making a problem here.", "NTA at all", "Does your family have a habit of bending over backwards to meet your sisters demands?

Like possibly in a really nice location? She could have been more disappointed at not being able to travel and have a little vacation for herself instead of going to your wedding. Or maybe she is flirting with a coworker and this conference is like, an opportunity for her. Just a theory of course.", "NTA \n\nSo instead of talking to you, your 42 year old grown ass sister walked out in a strop and your mother had to speak on her behalf? \n\nFor goodness sake.

Has she always been this way?   \nDon't let her nonsense cloud your day.", "I have been invited to weddings where I wasn\u2019t able to make it. I declined, wish them well and sent a gift. I think something is wrong with OP\u2019s sister. Possible since she is 42 and isn\u2019t married. It hurts to see your younger sister get married before you.", "NTA for not changing your wedding date.  And she is an AH for not being communicative and sulking and complaining about it to everybody else.\n\nHowever, I think it\u2019s a bit of an AH view to think that it\u2019s something as simple of \u201casking for work off\u201d.  Sure, maybe she could have skipped it, but a lot of work conferences are integral to people\u2019s careers.  Yes, if pushed, you can skip it, but that can potentially impact your progress at work.  You make it sound like she is some child who just needs her mommy to write her a note to get out of school. Things don\u2019t always work like that with work, especially the more advanced you get in your career.", "NTA.  The couple set the date they want.  If people can attend then that\u2019s good otherwise they pass on their apologies and don\u2019t attend.  I doubt you had any idea of your sisters work conference date before hand.  Personally I would have said anyone unhappy with the date can consider them selves uninvited (this would include your mother).", "NTA but you sister is. You get to set your wedding date. I'm assuming you told her well ahead of time like people normally do when planning a wedding? I don't get your parents reaction at all since weddings are definitely more important than work conferences. And she got the day off anyway? Your family sounds pretty toxic given what you've noted here. Hopefully your in-laws are cool. You can spend time with them instead.", "NTA. Relatives are biology, family is a choice. This relative is choosing work instead of being family, and these other relatives are supporting that choice.\n\nDon't let these relatives ruin it for you and your **family**.", "NTA - you're doing the right thing! It's your day, good luck and have fun!", "NTA but your sister and mom are. Have a wonderful wedding and a happy life!!", "NTA.  So obviously she wasn't  needed and this wasn't  so important because the boss said \"of course, family is important\".  If they really needed her they would have said no.\n\nThis is your wedding, you had a specific  date that meant something to you but she wants it changed for work.  So what if you changed the date for her and this work event got rescheduled?  Would you be expected to change the date again? \n\n Rather than be a mature adult your sister walks out and then tells your mom and others?  She should have spoken to you, accepted you wouldn't change it, ask work for the day off or not attend if it wasn't possible.  She is literally  making it about herself and playing some victim.\n\nIf your family can't behave they don't need to go to your wedding.  You deserve to have a happy wedding and don't need that negativity.", "NTA at all. It's your day, not hers.  \n\n\nI work a job where sometimes I absolutely cannot miss certain things (like conferences where I give presentations). I would definitely be upset if I found out my sibling's wedding conflicted with something like that. In fact, something like this recently happened with a stepsibling.  \n\n\nWhat I didn't do, however, is get upset at my stepsibling. I didn't silently throw a fit and walk out of the room. I simply mentioned I had a conflicting situation that I could not get out of, gave a meaningful apology, and bought them a present off of the registry.  \n\n\nWhat an absolutely infantile way to respond to this. I can certainly understand the wave of upset washing over a person when they realize they can't make something this important, but the last person you take that out on is the person whose wedding it is.", "NTA.  It's your wedding, you pick any day you want.  People don't like it, they don't have to come.  What your sister did was extremely rude and tacky.  She tried to make it all about her, when it's all about you and your fianc\u00e9.  I guess her work was able to spare her, and they wouldn't crumble without her.  Why the hell were your parents getting involved?", "NTA & congratulations I smiled when I saw you were getting married on my birthday!! September 23rd is a special day!", "Nta so sister basically admitted work was more important than your wedding and she can get the day off.  So you have the right to think your wedding  is more important than your sister taking a day or a few hours off work. Uninvited her.  Then she can do what is important to her and so can you.service", "Ah, she has main character syndrome. \nNTA", "NTA\n\nBy chance have your parents always pandered to your sister and her moods? Spending time in this sub really makes you question why people had kids before learning to communicate and take accountability for their own moods/emotions.\n\nOn a happier note, Congratulations to you both on your big day", "NTA but your sister sure was considering how her boss treated her request. if she had done that in the first place there wouldn't be any drama or hurt feelings. she literally made a mountain over a molehill and put the blame on you. good luck on your marriage and I'm glad you didn't' change the date to accommodate someone that didn't need accommodating", "Assuming you'd have been fine with her not attending (though I see she did get the day off anyway now), NAH except her reaction was A-holey. She could've said \"bummer, I can't make it that day due to a long-planned work event\" instead of stomping off and pouting.\n\nWhen you're planning something, you check with the date with everyone you regard as a \"must-attend.\" You didn't do check her availability when scheduling, so the implication is that you're okay if she can't attend. And given how she acted, I get why.", "NTA \n\nSo....  to confirm....  After all that manipulative bullshit and her talking to everyone EXCEPT you, it turns out her boss was like \"sure, no problem!\" when she FINALLY got around to just asking for the day off??  Good lord.  \n\nI think we know who is the family favorite.  (It's not you - sorry)", "NTA\n\nYour family is toxic", "Yup! Sis sounds like she needs to be center of attention at all times and when op dared to have one day to herself, sis gets up and huffy.", "My siblings did this all the time.  It was because it\u2019s the only way you can play the victim, when you\u2019re actually being the bully.", "Oh that last bit was just savage.", "Only if you set them on fire", "Came here to say this.  I suspect that she is not married, or is not happily married, and is jealous.\n\nNTA", "Definitely main character syndrome! In spite of sister claiming that the meeting couldn't go on without her, her boss clearly thought otherwise, telling her that taking the time off wasn't a problem. Not only that, her boss told her that family was more important than work. OP NTA. Sister definitely is AH.", "She never told us about her work conference! So we had no idea she had something that day!! Thanks for the advice!!!", "If it was a conference of some sort, it could definitely be as those can be the size of weddings and larger, held at conference centers with 100s or more attendees, blocks of hotel rooms, speakers / itineraries, registration and check-in procedures, catering and entertainment all part of the event. If OP's sister was responsible for planning the event, she would probably feel especially committed. \n\nSTILL, that doesn't excuse her ridiculously childish behavior and poor communication. I agree OP is NTA.", "My mom sits on the board of a large organization and they plan their conferences four years out. Each conference is in a different country. So for example at last year's conference, they selected the conference location and rough month for 2024 and 2026. They announced it, giving every member ample time to budget and book their calendars 2 and 4 years out. \n\nAlso, conference centres are sometimes booked a year in advance for more popular venues. \n\nAgree with you that OP is NTA here.", "That part isn\u2019t that unusual to me. Conferences, especially if the company is large, are usually planned months in advance. OP is still NTA though.", "Heck, I attend academic conferences that are scheduled 3 years out. But I\u2019d miss one for sibling wedding", "My work typically plans conferences one year or more in advance.", "She is the oldest and not married, everyone ABSOLUTELY caters to whatever she thinks.", "Not too savage though right?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Is she always so passive aggressive and non-communicative?", "That's right, our events are planned months in advance. By the time one wraps, we usually have an idea when next year's takes place.", "Kind of figured that just by the details you gave. I\u2019ve never understated entitled family members. And how families expect everybody in the family to cater to that particular person.\nSorry you went through this."]}
