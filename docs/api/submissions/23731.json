Adults causing real life drama around who you are unfriending on Facebook is childish behavior all around. He\u2019s caused drama at home because of the unfriending, and now issues for his wife with this friend. It\u2019s very easy to make it so that you never see anything people post, and they will never know it. The entire situation is childish, and it just got escalated. It would have only taken one emotionally mature person to end it; ie he could have just hidden her bigoted content. Or the wife could have just told her that he didn\u2019t agree with the bigoted posts and has the right to remove it from his feed. Or this woman could place less value in her Facebook friends, not to mention how the hell did she even realize he unfriended her?! Who is actually tracking those things? \n\nSo the whole thing is childish, and he participated by not just scrolling past and forgetting it. He did not start the childish behavior, but he also didn\u2019t stop it. And by not being the mature adult, it causes even more problems for him.", "NTA.\n\nThose \u201cfriends\u201d sound intolerant, tribal, and insufferably petty. God only knows (pun intended) why your wife wanted to be friends with them in the first place.", "NTA  people don't get notified when you unfriend them so it's weird that your wife's friends even noticed you did so. Also, your wife is mad that you \"ghosted\" people you don't frequently interact with because their response was to ghost her, and she doesn't see that those friends of hers are HAs?", "How the hell did they notice so quickly? Like do they stalk u? Facebook doesn\u2019t give u a notification if ur blocked u have to find that out on ur own\u2026", "You can just block them. \"Stop seeing their posts, but stay friends.\" The end result is the same for you, but you don't have to see their bullshit.  75% of all mine are just blocked, not unfriended.  It saves you from just this type of situation.", "Just get rid of FB. Does your world wonders unless you use marketplace a lot.", "NTA. I unfriended by BIL and SIL after they posted all sorts of bigoted \"conservative\" bullshit. Neither your religion nor your political party means I have to listen to your hateful vitriol to people who are just trying to live their lives.", "NTA", "Nta.  You were unfriended and told to get out of the country first.", "NTA, who's still using facebook??", "NTA sorry but the whole part of freedom of religion is to be free to practice whatever religion you want, if you're not religious then so be it.\n\nI would bring the post up with your wife as well, bonus points if you bring it up while they're there with her, triple points if you start packing a bag and when they ask where your going reply well seeing as I'm not Christian, I thought I better leave the country now before I get forcibly removed from this country for being an atheist.\n\nWould also make a good story on petty revenge then too \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA, you were entirely too kind to that trash.", "NTA.\n\nIf they unfriended your wife for that, they weren't much of a friend to her anyway.", "NTA - but really concerned about how much Facebook is weighted", "NTA, I have a firm boundary that my social media is my business and as long as I\u2019m not posting or tagging my boyfriend, he cannot dictate to me what I share or what I say and who I\u2019m friends with.", "NTA. There is certain crap on social media I either can\u2019t stand or refuse to be associated with and OP has every right to do the same.\n\nWhat sort of crap am I talking about? An ex-worker of mine went off the deep end with COVID and I took her ability to \u201ctag\u201d me away abuse she began conspiracy theories that I didn\u2019t want to be associated with. As well, while she is a complete anti-vaxxer, I have greatly benefited from allergy shots and I feel stupid questioning the science saving my life.", "I'm sorry, why are any of the 30+ y/o in this situation giving a single shit about anything to do with Facebook? Even you OP, you were trying to send some kind of a message by unfriending them. And then the friends took the message in the way you intended it. Then your wife is bad because they unfriended her on FB? This is so freaking weird. NTA I guess", "NTA if their biggest problem in life is getting unfriended by an acquaintance on Facebook after making a controversial post, I wish I could have their stress-free lives.", "NTA", "NTA. It takes something to look up people who unfriend you. Ask your wife if you should have confronted them on the topic of \"do not judge least ye be judged\" and provide a decisive proof of her friends being bigots that will surely go to hell if judged by their own books.", "Three words: separation of church and state. NTA for unfriending idiots", "NTA.. Your wife is upset that you unfriending people who you don't even really know? That is ridiculous. There must be other things bothering her and this is what she is trying to fight about.", "The consequences are so insignificant that I don't know why her friends even care.", "Assuming the \"friends\" are US citizens, it may be better to post \"You are not American if you think everyone should be the same religion. Americans believe in free choice. \"", "The reality is that to most American Christians, the core of Christian identity is wielding power over others, and if they can\u2019t do that they don\u2019t feel free. It\u2019s a culture that is inherently incompatible with the liberal democratic values that are the draw for most people outside the church.", "She is not a true christian. It seems she doesn't follow bible. God loves all christians, non christians. NTA", "This, also make sure you bring this up when they're there, mostly because you can then post the fallout on r/petty revenge \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "She already knows her friends hate OP because he isn't Christian.", "Why?  OP already knows she thinks hatred toward non-Christians is acceptable.", "They may very well have posted their hateful memes for the purpose of seeing who would unfriend them over it.", "If his wife can be alienated from her Christian nationalist, prejudiced \"friends\" by her husband simply quietly unfriending them? They weren't friends worth having to begin with. He did absolutely nothing wrong.", "They actually came because they were afraid of their children being exposed to other religious ideas in the Netherlands which had a much stronger commitment to religious freedom.", "Maybe she agrees with them.", "There wasn't anything \"indirect\" about it.", "What?  Only non-Christians can be hateful, is that what you're saying?", "Exactamundo!", "It's not OP's job to educate them.  It wouldn't help anyway, because they want to change the Constitution.", "Well indeed - should probably ask that pointed question!", "That sounds like a fun conversation to have with them. Invite them over for dinner as an olive branch, explain why you unfriended them, and see if you can come to a meeting of the minds.\n\nYour wife may end up wishing you\u2019d just ghosted them on FB.", "Well, yeah, but that\u2019s because it would be redundant once we deport all the heathens.", ">If the person is actually a bigot, then unfriending them and stopping there is childish because you haven\u2019t actually done anything actionable other than make yourself feel good.\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by actitonable? Do you think he should openly challenge the person's views or something? And what's so bad about making yourself feel good that you no longer have to see a bigot's FB posts? \n\n>He\u2019s caused drama at home because of the unfriending, and now issues for his wife with this friend.\n\nIf his personal decision on who allows access to his social media causes issues with his wife, then it sounds like the wife is the only one with the issues. Her anger should really be directed at the friend who is ggosting her due to someone else's behavior-behavior that isn't even negative or hurtful in any way. It's not like he commented insults and personal attacks at this woman. If she's upset at being unfriended on a social media platform, then she's the only one acting childishly. OP should have the freedom to choose how he handles his social media accounts. And he doesn't have to friends with his wife's friends if he doesn't want to be; there's not some rule that spouses have to share all their friends, just that they have to be civil and respectful. \n\n>It would have only taken one emotionally mature person to end it; ie he could have just hidden her bigoted content.\n\nOr he could be thinking it's better to unfriend her bc by staying friends with her, he's making himself complicit regarding her bigoted posts. I mean, if you wouldn't normally be friends in real life with a bigot, why would you want to be friends online with a bigot? Why would you want other ppl to think you agree with what a bigot is saying by visibly being friends with them?", "This person is really reaching to make the husband the bad guy.  \"Be friends with bigots, like an adult!\"  Unbelievable.", "If someone publicly shares their views, I don\u2019t see a problem with respectfully challenging them. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what we are doing right now, and it helps us to expand our self awareness  and further understand each other. He could have simply pointed out that he, and possibly his wife, are atheist. Then this woman can decide for herself if she wants to continue being friends with someone who she just openly expressed disdain for.  As I said, he\u2019s allowed to do whatever he wants with his Facebook, and to make himself feel good, but it clearly caused him larger problems down the road. Childish behavior is often rooted in making you feel good now, without thought to the consequences later. \n\n\nAs I said, the friend and the wife are also acting childish. Personally, I\u2019d agree that the friend is the most childish, then the wife and then the husband, the husband being the least childish of the three. But since he only has control over his own actions, and all this childish drama involves him, he could have picked a different reaction and caused himself far less real world drama. He could have scrolled right past, and just ignored it or just muted her content so he never even sees it. Just because one person is being extremely childish, doesn\u2019t mean someone else involved can\u2019t also be acting a little childish as well. \n\nI agree with you that there is potential harm in being \u201cassociated\u201d with this person due to their Facebook friendship. However, if anyone was that concerned, they could just reach out to him and ask about their relationship and his opinion of the views she shares. That would be a very adult thing to do, or they could just make assumptions and block him because of something they assumed\u2026 which would be childish. Further more, this person is a real world friend of his wife, so it\u2019s not just a random person he went to high school with, it\u2019s someone who he actually knows and comes to his house. So the argument of wanting to avoid people thinking you associate with them is kind of hard to make given that he and his wife do associate with them. I supposed if you wanted something actionable it would be a conversation with his wife around this persons views, how she interprets the friends views, how the views make the husband feel and if they should continue to associate with them. None of which is a childish or impulsive response to the whole situation. In the end, the husband only has control over one person; himself. So if he wants to have a dram free life he needs to focus on the things he can control, and that\u2019s his own behavior. It doesn\u2019t really matter who is the most right and who is the least childish, because in the end his goal should be peace with him and his wife. Maybe that means he just scrolls past her posts. Maybe that means he mutes her page. Both of which are an option that nobody ever knows about. He chose to unfriend her, which is perfectly within reason, but that choice is something that has the potential to lead to further drama, and it did. That choice was the only thing he had control over on this whole situation and the only thing he could have don\u2019t differently to avoid all the drama. That doesn\u2019t mean he should have to do it, and it doesn\u2019t make the wife or friend any less wrong, but his choice contributed to his current situation. His choice was made emotionally to make himself feel better in the moment and that\u2019s childish. And now he has to deal with the impact of that choice in his marriage. And yes, the wife and the friend are far more childish than the husband, which is just one more reason to have thought about his options and tried to avoid any situation where the childish people are going to have to act like adults.", "I never said he\u2019s a bad guy, in fact I agree with him about his opinion on the friends remarks. He is married to a woman who is literally doing the thing you\u2019re accusing me of saying that he should do. I\u2019m not sure why people can understand that there is a spectrum of blame, and just because the husband might be 90% right, that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be 10% wrong. You have to misrepresent what I\u2019m saying to make me seem like the bad guy, while I\u2019m trying to have a civil discourse and openly asking you how you would handle the situation.  And for the record, you never once offer any insight to the questions I asked you. Instead you ignored them and just charged to a different attack vector. Also, you made a quote in your comment and I never said the thing you quoted. It\u2019s not a surprise you can\u2019t recognize childish behavior.", "\"It's childish to unfriend someone instead of ignoring them\" as though you wouldn't do that in real life? Do they think, if a friend turned out to be a bigoted person, that most ppl would just ignore their remarks and change the subject instead of outright stopping to be friends with them?"]}
