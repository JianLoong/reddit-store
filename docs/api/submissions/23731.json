You did the most mature & respectful thing you could do in that situation, which was simply unfriending them.

Furthermore, ghosting someone means they reached out to you directly & you chose not to reply. So the statement your wife made doesnt really make sense to me. Her friend literally said you should NOT be in this country, & she is upset with you for simply unfriending that person? You are allowed to choose who you associate yourself with. \n\nI am atheist.

Based on this she has made a number of assertions about the religious background of the USA and when I asked her about any research to back up views she cited a number of questionable articles and sources including RT,  Global Times, Epoch Times, American Catholic Tribune, RI, along with Joe Rogan and a few similar places.\n\nWhen people start buying into and believing things in an echo chamber that features misleading, untrue and questionable sourcing they start thinking that those kind of views are acceptable because they keep hearing it coming back at them all the time.
