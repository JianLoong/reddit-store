People who would rather OP / Her Husband, removed from the country.\n\nAsk her why she is backing someone like that up, and why she doesn't back you up like that.", "NTA her friends sound really judgy. And they\u2019re not your friends. I really don\u2019t understand why people get so upset over someone \u201cunfriending\u201d them on social media. Like, everyone does remember that two decades ago, that wasn\u2019t even a thing, right?", "NTA for sure. Everyone here is an adult, like... it's so high school to tattle about who unfriends/friends people on social media. I think your wife needs new friends.", "To clarify, you unfriended some people you don't know, and now they won't talk to your wife?\n\nTheir reaction is bizarre at a minimum. \n\nNTA", "NTA but your wife sounds like a 14 yo girl", "These are not your friends.

You did the most mature & respectful thing you could do in that situation, which was simply unfriending them. If you do not engage in conversation outside of being polite while they are with your wife, then they are not YOUR friends. You dont owe them anything. \n\nHonestly, I dont understand what the big deal is with FB. What difference does it make if you are friends or not friends with anyone on FB? Furthermore, ghosting someone means they reached out to you directly & you chose not to reply. So the statement your wife made doesnt really make sense to me. Her friend literally said you should NOT be in this country, & she is upset with you for simply unfriending that person? You are allowed to choose who you associate yourself with. \n\nI am atheist. My family is Christian. They would never say anything directly or indirectly like that. If they did, I would block them without hesitation. There is no need for toxic people in your life. Especially when those people are not even YOUR friend.", "Lmao fuck those people.

Based on this she has made a number of assertions about the religious background of the USA and when I asked her about any research to back up views she cited a number of questionable articles and sources including RT,  Global Times, Epoch Times, American Catholic Tribune, RI, along with Joe Rogan and a few similar places.\n\nWhen people start buying into and believing things in an echo chamber that features misleading, untrue and questionable sourcing they start thinking that those kind of views are acceptable because they keep hearing it coming back at them all the time.  The best you could do is to educate your wife on why that opinion is wrong and say that you don't want to include people who hold such things as true in your feed and in the things that you read or are included in your feed as a result.", "I\u2019m baffled that they even realized you unfriended them. You two likely never even interacted on the platform. Unless they intentionally did that to monitor who would unfriend them \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s a little childish of you to do that\u2026 even though I think their post was stupid. You can just hide anything people post and remain \u201cfriends\u201d, then you keep the peace and don\u2019t have to see their content. Or just scroll past it, then at least you get to monitor the types of people they are both online and in person.", "NTA, you took the high road. It's Facebook, do they check their friends list hourly? Some people need a real life.", "NTA, if you don't have kids drop this chick and run.
