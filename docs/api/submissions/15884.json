How is the relationship between your niece and her mom?\n\nIn any case, you do seem like an AH just for what you write at the end of your post. I understand a mother can have some expectations of being invited to her daughter's birthday, and you for sure should understand the distress that a parent can feel for being apart from her children. So you answering her in a such passive-aggressive and unsympathetic makes you quite YTA.", "Niece birthday party. Bio mum absent. Now, what could possibly be wrong with that...?", "YTA. You left out a lot of information here, OP. Who has primary custody? Why was mom left out?\n\nAlso, as much as you'd like to believe, she is not, in fact, your child. You have no right to speak to her mother that way. \n\nYou need to step back. I'm sorry you can't have children, but that gives you no right to try and take someone else's. I find it very strange that you dress her like you, and you've started treating her like a daughter. Adoption is available for a reason. \n\nGood luck", "Sorry but YTA you didn\u2019t think to invite her mum? Regardless of your relationship with her she is your nieces mum. Edited to add from the way you say you see her as your own child, invited everyone but her mum and got matching clothes just for you and her I agree with sil that you are trying to replace her.", "[removed]", "INFO: why did you bother posting here since you clearly don't think you did anything wrong?", "Yta. Honestly sounds sketch on your part. Why didn't you invite her. You didn't state a reason why not...? And ur trying to twin the niece. Yikes.", "I N F O Who has primary custody? What kind of relationship does the niece have with SIL? On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate brothers and SIL's ability to interact with each other, with a 1 being \"can't talk outside a court room\" and a 10 being \"somehow best friends despite being divorced\"? Does your brother have an opinion here, and if so what is it?\n\nEdit, based on response: I'm honestly reluctant to give a judgment here, as bias in the post could very easily change any judgment given, more so than usual. This could very easily be a case of the kid choosing the fun adult over the responsible one.\n\n On one hand, You aren't even trying to deny SIL accusation, and even takes pride in it. I also see no reason why SIL had to be excluded. No major issues with the original mothers parenting have been mentioned, which would be unusual for this sort of post if they existed.\n\n On the other hand, niece has no problem with this and has made her choice. That brother has primary custody indicates that while there are no critical issues, the courts have more confidence in the brothers parenting skills than the mothers. \n\nI think I'm going to go ESH. You *are* trying to replace your nieces mother, with no clear evidence that SIL is a bad mother. That being said, lashing out at you isn't a productive response, she would be better served trying to mend bridges with her daughter. There are circumstantial indicators, but not evidence, that you are succeeding partially due to failures on her part in caring for her daughter. You are however, *very* close to Y T A.", "YTA\n\nThe biggest red flag here is referring to her as your ex sister in law, rather than as your niece's mother.", "YTA. It sounds like you are overstepping big time. It\u2019s ok to be a cool aunt, but you are not her mum.", "Damn.  Shots fired.\n\nI hear your words and Mayne with context we do not tknow about that seems fine, but with limited info,  you should have invited mom and the best mom thing is a dig at her bio-mom.  Again, idk what yells relationship is.   \n\nSoft YTA. Info as it stands", "Wow. YTA. \n\nThe whole matchy-matchy and 'we see her as our child' is creepy as hell. She's *not* your daughter. She has a mother. She has a father.\n\nStay in your lane.", "I'll have to go with YTA. Did your niece say that she did not want her mom say? Has anything happened which would explain why you did not invite her?I am so sorry that you cannot have kids and its beautiful that you're close with your niece but she already has a mom and its not you.\n\nI think you should maybe seek therapy. Because not being able to have children does something to a person and you should maybe tap into that because it seems like youre projecting your aggression and anger towards a person thats not at fault for you not being able to have children yourself.  \n\n\nEDIT: Just read through some of your answers. It seems to me like you just wanted to hear what a great aunt you are and since noone tells you that you get very defensive and lowkey mean. Also: calling the mom egg donor... Egg donor to whom? You?", "YTA and clearly very immature.\n\nYou\u2019re argument is that she doesn\u2019t know how to be a mom full time but she has another child who I\u2019m assuming she cares for full time. Your niece chose to live with your brother so how does that make her mother a bad person for honouring that choice? How does wanting to be involved in her child\u2019s day make her a bad mother? \n\nYou trying desperately hard to take her place as mom is mind boggling obvious and selfish. It\u2019s what\u2019s in the best interest of the child, which will always be to have a positive relationship with both parents. You don\u2019t get to just swoop in when she turned 9 and give yourself a new title. I can imagine your niece is clearly being influenced by your attitude towards her mum. Enjoy your fun aunt moment, karma will hit you in a few years.", "YTA", "YTA. Seems like you need to come to terms with your situation. Whether you like SIL or you think she's a bad mum or whatever, she will always be the child's mother. You will always be auntie. Stop overstepping boundaries.", "YTA mostly for your response to your ex SIL. You are trying to take her mom's spot and you need to stop. It's great that you have a good relationship with your neice but it should be an aunt/neice relationship, not a mother /daughter one.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry about your fertility problems but she is not yours to claim. It\u2019s one thing to be there for the girl but this sounds like you have been brainwashing this little girl to your own selfish needs. \nAnd you\u2019re causing pain to her actual mother by trying to merge yourself into her role.", "Info, the only question that matters imo, did your niece want her there? If no, then nta, if yes, then yta. It's her party,  her choice. Though from the sounds of her caption, I already have a pretty good guess.", "YTA", "INFO: Do you encourage your niece to see you as a mother figure or do you remind her that you're her aunt, and that she already has a mother? Do you encourage her relationship with her mother?", "YTA. And from your responses you need therapy as well. You're buying this child's love and manipulating her to push bio mom out. You sound unhinged, I'm sure bio mom is not as bad as you make her out to be. You need to villainize her to justify your horrible actions. I hope niece wises up and goes no contact with you one day.", "YTA \n\nYou sound bitter.", "YTA - This is just straight up fkn creepy and weird.", "Let me guess. Your SIL was stay at home mom or was earning Much less then your Brother, and your Brother has Been using money to get niece favor him. AH", "YTA.\n\nI knew you would be TA just by the fact that you address your niece\u2019s mom as \u201cex SIL\u201d in this story.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you cannot have kids but your niece is not your daughter and you are not her parent. It\u2019s kinda messed up that you would exclude her actual mother from her daughter\u2019s birthday.", "Damn, humanity is lucky you can't reproduce. It's a shame your brother allows you access a kid to fuck up anyway. Hopefully your niece will be able to rebuild a relationship with her mom when she's old enough to see the way you have manipulated her. YTA.", "NTA for not inviting her to her own daughter's party since it's a party that you and your brother put together and y'all can invite whoever you want. \n\nAbsolute YTA for that shit ass comment towards your niece's mom, being that aunt that oversteps and projects onto others, and acting all holier than thou. Just because you can't have kids, doesn't mean you can just substitute your brother's child as your own. You're weird for captioning your photo with your niece saying you're the best mom.", "NTA\n\nThe niece is 14 and can surely decide for herself who she wanta at the party. From your post it looks like she didn't want her mother there.", "NTA \n\nIf your niece wanted her mother there, she would\u2019ve said something. Based on your responses in the comments, they don\u2019t have a good relationship. \n\nIf anything, your ex SIL should\u2019ve asked her daughter why she wasn\u2019t invited.", "NTA. Ex\u2019s are only invited if everyone is in good terms.", "This may be an unpopular opinion but I actually think NTA. \nI am a step mum and we never shared birthday parties with the bio mum. She was very set on only ever doing her own thing and we were never invited to anything. \nOkay so we don\u2019t have the same situation, but I actually don\u2019t think the OP has done anything except be blunt", "Eh ... NTA. The kid is 14 years old calling her aunt her mom, that doesn't happen overnight. That happens from some serious disconnect from bio mom. Doesn't even sound like the child wanted her there/missed her bio mom in the first place.\n\nPeople on here are making some real stretches trying to make a relationship between niece and ex-SIL that somehow got violated. \n\nI'm honestly curious if Ex- SIL was actually going to do anything at all for the kid's birthday or was just mad someone else did and made her look bad.", "Unless they have a decent relationship why would OP invite her ex SIL to the party. If her niece\u2019s dad wanted his ex there he would have invited her. Not all parents get along with their ex. Plus ex-SIL obviously knows when her daughter\u2019s birthday is so I would expect her to throw her kid a party with her family and friends and not invite her ex or his family. If the niece posted that auntie is the best mom than her real mom should be questioning why her daughter feels that way about her aunt. Maybe the daughter has a better relationship with auntie than her own mom.", "i feel really sorry for you", "NTA...

Mom & dad are no longer family - they should not have to host one another. This is what divorce means.

I thought it was common for children of divorced parents to have separate birthday parties.\n\nThat being said, I also think that OP has crossed some boundaries here.

The wording of the birthday girl calling you best mom matters. Even if you have a really great aunt who you love and are close with, you call them your best/favorite aunt. No one in this thread knows the specifics of the nieces mom but we\u2019ve seen the \u201cleft for a new family\u201d play out a lot where the first kid is left behind. Kids upset with their parents and saying someone else is their favorite or they hate them is usually short lived unless the parent actually is hurting the relationship with the child. If her mom feels she\u2019s being replaced, then it\u2019s her job to find ways to include daughter on the very few times she sees her, and then talk to aunt about potential boundary. Don\u2019t see that effort mentioned at all, I think mom is tired with newer child and wanted to get out of the house and also look good. If the child requested limited visitation with mom, doesn\u2019t matter the age, that is HER VALID choice, the court agreed to this time split for a reason!!!! There needs to be legit cause for lack of equal time or there was no fight bec the mom didn\u2019t want more. Also.. it\u2019s your brothers responsibility to communicate with her especially since he was involved in planning. People are harping on your mention of no kids without understanding it was just for context why you have the time and space to be that close with the niece as she lives primarily w dad. He\u2019s your brother who was presumably hurt by the split, ofc you\u2019re going to have feelings toward ex sil especially given the desire she really doesn\u2019t show about daughter or she would\u2019ve have a convo w her about a birthday plan herself. As a teen there is more complexity to parent relations, when you\u2019re in 3/4th grade as she was around when they split, it\u2019s you\u2019re my mom bec you\u2019re my mom (for many, not all, their mom is who does stuff for them so they love them) at 14 you\u2019re close if not entering high-school, and parent conversations can be much more deep.

If you are the surrogate mother figure, teaching her how to treat others you don't get along with is an important part of the job.  \n\nIf her mom is terrible- there is still no need to poison the well like this and provoke her or cause her pain. Trust your niece to choose who she wants in her life and focus on providing a positive warm relationship for her. That leaves you in the clear if your niece wants a better relationship with her in the future. Her mom can't paint you as bitter and the source of the past turmoil in their relationship in order to drive a wedge between you two. Trading jabs with your ex-sil also ensures she will focus on you and get angrier/more vindictive as the years go on. \n\nIf the quality of your niece's life isn't good enough reason- at least save yourself the headache.
