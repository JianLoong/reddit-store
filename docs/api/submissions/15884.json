How is the relationship between your niece and her mom?\n\nIn any case, you do seem like an AH just for what you write at the end of your post. I understand a mother can have some expectations of being invited to her daughter's birthday, and you for sure should understand the distress that a parent can feel for being apart from her children. So you answering her in a such passive-aggressive and unsympathetic makes you quite YTA.", "Niece birthday party. Bio mum absent. Now, what could possibly be wrong with that...?", "YTA. You left out a lot of information here, OP. Who has primary custody? Why was mom left out?\n\nAlso, as much as you'd like to believe, she is not, in fact, your child. You have no right to speak to her mother that way. \n\nYou need to step back. I'm sorry you can't have children, but that gives you no right to try and take someone else's. I find it very strange that you dress her like you, and you've started treating her like a daughter. Adoption is available for a reason. \n\nGood luck", "Sorry but YTA you didn\u2019t think to invite her mum? Regardless of your relationship with her she is your nieces mum. Edited to add from the way you say you see her as your own child, invited everyone but her mum and got matching clothes just for you and her I agree with sil that you are trying to replace her.", "You sound completely unhinged.", "INFO: why did you bother posting here since you clearly don't think you did anything wrong?", "Yta. Honestly sounds sketch on your part. Why didn't you invite her. You didn't state a reason why not...? And ur trying to twin the niece. Yikes.", "I N F O Who has primary custody? What kind of relationship does the niece have with SIL? On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate brothers and SIL's ability to interact with each other, with a 1 being \"can't talk outside a court room\" and a 10 being \"somehow best friends despite being divorced\"? Does your brother have an opinion here, and if so what is it?\n\nEdit, based on response: I'm honestly reluctant to give a judgment here, as bias in the post could very easily change any judgment given, more so than usual. This could very easily be a case of the kid choosing the fun adult over the responsible one.\n\n On one hand, You aren't even trying to deny SIL accusation, and even takes pride in it. I also see no reason why SIL had to be excluded. No major issues with the original mothers parenting have been mentioned, which would be unusual for this sort of post if they existed.\n\n On the other hand, niece has no problem with this and has made her choice. That brother has primary custody indicates that while there are no critical issues, the courts have more confidence in the brothers parenting skills than the mothers. \n\nI think I'm going to go ESH. You *are* trying to replace your nieces mother, with no clear evidence that SIL is a bad mother. That being said, lashing out at you isn't a productive response, she would be better served trying to mend bridges with her daughter. There are circumstantial indicators, but not evidence, that you are succeeding partially due to failures on her part in caring for her daughter. You are however, *very* close to Y T A.", "YTA\n\nThe biggest red flag here is referring to her as your ex sister in law, rather than as your niece's mother.", "YTA. It sounds like you are overstepping big time. It\u2019s ok to be a cool aunt, but you are not her mum.", "Damn.  Shots fired.\n\nI hear your words and Mayne with context we do not tknow about that seems fine, but with limited info,  you should have invited mom and the best mom thing is a dig at her bio-mom.  Again, idk what yells relationship is.   \n\nSoft YTA. Info as it stands", "Wow. YTA. \n\nThe whole matchy-matchy and 'we see her as our child' is creepy as hell. She's *not* your daughter. She has a mother. She has a father.\n\nStay in your lane.", "I'll have to go with YTA. Did your niece say that she did not want her mom say? Has anything happened which would explain why you did not invite her?I am so sorry that you cannot have kids and its beautiful that you're close with your niece but she already has a mom and its not you.\n\nI think you should maybe seek therapy. Because not being able to have children does something to a person and you should maybe tap into that because it seems like youre projecting your aggression and anger towards a person thats not at fault for you not being able to have children yourself.  \n\n\nEDIT: Just read through some of your answers. It seems to me like you just wanted to hear what a great aunt you are and since noone tells you that you get very defensive and lowkey mean. Also: calling the mom egg donor... Egg donor to whom? You?", "YTA and clearly very immature.\n\nYou\u2019re argument is that she doesn\u2019t know how to be a mom full time but she has another child who I\u2019m assuming she cares for full time. Your niece chose to live with your brother so how does that make her mother a bad person for honouring that choice? How does wanting to be involved in her child\u2019s day make her a bad mother? \n\nYou trying desperately hard to take her place as mom is mind boggling obvious and selfish. It\u2019s what\u2019s in the best interest of the child, which will always be to have a positive relationship with both parents. You don\u2019t get to just swoop in when she turned 9 and give yourself a new title. I can imagine your niece is clearly being influenced by your attitude towards her mum. Enjoy your fun aunt moment, karma will hit you in a few years.", "YTA", "YTA. Seems like you need to come to terms with your situation. Whether you like SIL or you think she's a bad mum or whatever, she will always be the child's mother. You will always be auntie. Stop overstepping boundaries.", "YTA mostly for your response to your ex SIL. You are trying to take her mom's spot and you need to stop. It's great that you have a good relationship with your neice but it should be an aunt/neice relationship, not a mother /daughter one.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry about your fertility problems but she is not yours to claim. It\u2019s one thing to be there for the girl but this sounds like you have been brainwashing this little girl to your own selfish needs. \nAnd you\u2019re causing pain to her actual mother by trying to merge yourself into her role.", "Info, the only question that matters imo, did your niece want her there? If no, then nta, if yes, then yta. It's her party,  her choice. Though from the sounds of her caption, I already have a pretty good guess.", "YTA", "INFO: Do you encourage your niece to see you as a mother figure or do you remind her that you're her aunt, and that she already has a mother? Do you encourage her relationship with her mother?", "YTA. And from your responses you need therapy as well. You're buying this child's love and manipulating her to push bio mom out. You sound unhinged, I'm sure bio mom is not as bad as you make her out to be. You need to villainize her to justify your horrible actions. I hope niece wises up and goes no contact with you one day.", "YTA \n\nYou sound bitter.", "YTA - This is just straight up fkn creepy and weird.", "Let me guess. Your SIL was stay at home mom or was earning Much less then your Brother, and your Brother has Been using money to get niece favor him. AH", "YTA.\n\nI knew you would be TA just by the fact that you address your niece\u2019s mom as \u201cex SIL\u201d in this story.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you cannot have kids but your niece is not your daughter and you are not her parent. It\u2019s kinda messed up that you would exclude her actual mother from her daughter\u2019s birthday.", "Damn, humanity is lucky you can't reproduce. It's a shame your brother allows you access a kid to fuck up anyway. Hopefully your niece will be able to rebuild a relationship with her mom when she's old enough to see the way you have manipulated her. YTA.", "NTA for not inviting her to her own daughter's party since it's a party that you and your brother put together and y'all can invite whoever you want. \n\nAbsolute YTA for that shit ass comment towards your niece's mom, being that aunt that oversteps and projects onto others, and acting all holier than thou. Just because you can't have kids, doesn't mean you can just substitute your brother's child as your own. You're weird for captioning your photo with your niece saying you're the best mom.", "NTA\n\nThe niece is 14 and can surely decide for herself who she wanta at the party. From your post it looks like she didn't want her mother there.", "NTA \n\nIf your niece wanted her mother there, she would\u2019ve said something. Based on your responses in the comments, they don\u2019t have a good relationship. \n\nIf anything, your ex SIL should\u2019ve asked her daughter why she wasn\u2019t invited.", "NTA. Ex\u2019s are only invited if everyone is in good terms.", "This may be an unpopular opinion but I actually think NTA. \nI am a step mum and we never shared birthday parties with the bio mum. She was very set on only ever doing her own thing and we were never invited to anything. \nOkay so we don\u2019t have the same situation, but I actually don\u2019t think the OP has done anything except be blunt", "Eh ... NTA. The kid is 14 years old calling her aunt her mom, that doesn't happen overnight. That happens from some serious disconnect from bio mom. Doesn't even sound like the child wanted her there/missed her bio mom in the first place.\n\nPeople on here are making some real stretches trying to make a relationship between niece and ex-SIL that somehow got violated. \n\nI'm honestly curious if Ex- SIL was actually going to do anything at all for the kid's birthday or was just mad someone else did and made her look bad.", "Unless they have a decent relationship why would OP invite her ex SIL to the party. If her niece\u2019s dad wanted his ex there he would have invited her. Not all parents get along with their ex. Plus ex-SIL obviously knows when her daughter\u2019s birthday is so I would expect her to throw her kid a party with her family and friends and not invite her ex or his family. If the niece posted that auntie is the best mom than her real mom should be questioning why her daughter feels that way about her aunt. Maybe the daughter has a better relationship with auntie than her own mom.", "i feel really sorry for you", "NTA...

If she has a strained relationship with her mother and you love your niece, you should be encouraging their relationship, not trying to replace her mother. What you did was well out of line and when she gets older I'd be surprised if she didn't see that. You should have gone to therapy or tried to adopt if you want children so badly. Being inappropriate in your relationship with your niece and nasty to her mother is not the way to go. If I were your husband I would have insisted her mother be invited. I would have also had a word with niece about how her mother may feel upset at seeing posts where you are described as the best mom. But it seems you only care about your own feelings.

You're trying to make your niece's MOTHER look like a bad parent but you're the one who's a bad person. You're shoving the mother out of the way because you can't have children so you're stealing hers. I bet you and your brother are bribing her with gifts and parties that his ex can't afford. And the matching outfits? Yup. You did that to make yourself look like her mom. You're not and never will be her mom.

I say this as someone who can't have kids either. When I found out it was devastating, but I didn't use that as a reason to usurp someone else's role as parent. So you babysit twice a week. So what? By your logic, that makes a babysitter a kid's mother. You're grasping at straws because you're desperate to prove that your ex SIL isn't your niece's mother. Nope.

Surely if the parents are divorced, both sides of parents/family will tend to do parties? Custody is what it is, if the child's birthday falls when they are with the dad then why can't he and his family have a party on that day? I mean I do think OP claiming to be the child's mum here is a bit much, I'd be pissed about that if I was the mum and I'd have something to say about all the Instagram stuff, but I wouldn't be expecting to go to the party.

OP's brother and his wife are divorced.  **It is very normal for kids with divorced parents to have 2 birthday parties - one with mom and one with dad.**  In this case, OP and her brother collaborated and jointly threw the \"dad party\".  The niece's dad was involved in the party planning and could have invited his ex-wife if he wanted to.  He clearly chose not to.\n\nOP - you need to talk to your niece about her calling you the best mom.  Be gentle, but ask her to refer to you as \"the best aunt\" going forward.\n\nThe only thing I really see wrong here was the shitty comment that OP made to her ex-SIL instead of just having her brother deal with his ex-wife.  But as many others have pointed out, we have no idea what kind of background there is.  Keep in mind that the mom is OP's brother's ex-wife.  Divorces are messy and ugly, so there's bound to be bad blood between them.", "NTA - I don't think you did anything wrong. If the mother was in her life more that just being a weekend parent, then maybe. Most children that I have seen from divorced homes have two parties, unless they are very involved in co parenting. The father helped you plan the party, and if he didn't see fit to invite her, I don't see why you should take the blame.", "I\u2019m going NTA. It\u2019s very common for divorced couples to have separate parties. If the mom wants to do a party, she can do one with her family. The brother is obviously not on good terms with his ex.

Its completely acceptable if childs dad chose not to invite his ex to a party with his family (my ex always had his own family thing for our child). \n\nThere is nothing wrong with an aunt loving and caring for her niece, and if her and her husband have the extra to give/ spend with niece parents should feel blessed to have others in her life who love her.\n\nThe child posted \"best mom ever\" not the aunt. Theres a whole box of stuff to open there. Why does 14 yr old value someone else over their mom. It normally takes a lot to reach that level of strain between a child and mother that a child choses to call someone else mom. mother called aunt to start trouble. Why did mother not address it with childs father if she felt it violated their parenting agreement. Why did mother not kindly ask child why she felt that way? Mother is projecting her guilt onto aunt, because aunt is showing love towards child. Who yells at an aunt for loving their niece?", "NTA, your brother and your nieces father helped plan it. If someone should have invited the bio-mom then it should be him. I don't understand why everyone is blaming OP for this. Also, the bio-mom could have organised something herself or asked what the plans will be for HER child's birthday.

Less for not inviting her.", "YTA for the way you spoke to her mom. You've given no real reason here for why you said that to her. Not being the custodial parent does not make someone a bad parent. There are a lot of factors that go into that decision. I don't think you necessarily should have invited her mom to the party, I can understand that might be awkward for many families.
