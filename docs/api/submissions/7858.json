Im thinking maybe if we go over there for holidays the time will be limited and I will need to just keep shuffling rooms.", "Haha yea. No its a 4 1/2 year old being mean to my toddler. He really should know better though right?", "Why do you need to \"bring it up to him\"? You're watching it happen with your own eyes. If he comes up with some pretty words, are you going to deny your own lying eyes? News flash: Of course he's going to tap dance around and try to justify his behavior. So what's the point in even talking about it?", "The family that allows their child to hurt yours?  Your daughter deserves better.", "Your child's safety and will being should always be your FIRST concern. I've gone LC or NC with family who acted like this. I've taught my kids to hit back when they got old enough. \"NEVER start a fight but ALWAYS finish one or at least hurt the bully bad enough that they won't mess with you.\" is what I've taught both my son & daughter. \nYou're her parent, it is your job to protect her, also your husband's and he is failing at fatherhood. Just bc someone is autistic doesn't mean they have a right to hurt others", "Her family is abusing her. Why on earth would you force her to see family who are abusing her?", "Yes he is. And ultimately that's a call nobody will be able to make on your behalf. But it is something that you will need to consider for your daughter's sake.", "Don't worry about them liking you.  If your fiance wasn't related to them, you wouldn't tolerate them.", "Why do you care if shitty people like you? Listen I spent years  trying to make shitty in-laws like me, in the end they were shitty people who didn\u2019t like anyone who didn\u2019t kiss their asses, my ex eventually realized how toxic they were and cut them off, but the damage to our marriage and relationship with my kids was permanent.", "You're allowing your daughter to be in a house with someone who is bullying her. You're putting her in a situation to be abused by her father's very younger brother.", "The holidays don't have a damn thing to do with this. What you're saying, whether you realize it or not is that in order to have a family holiday, you're willing to let your daughter be bullied and abused. She's not some pawn that you trade for pretending to have happy family time. YTA for not putting a stop to this immediately, waffling around and continuing to date a man that does not protect your child. You cannot be that desperate for a man that you will allow your daughter to risk being harmed.", "Yes you are.", "Have you ever tried correcting his behavior? You don\u2019t have to scream, but you can say \u201cshe was playing with that you, you have it when she\u2019s finished?\u201d in a firm tone?", "especially the family who is ignoring it. especially when they are ignoring it because \"he's autistic.\"\n\nand? if he's behaving this way at 4, what is he going to be like at 14 or 24? when he isn't a small child that can be physically moved. something like autism might explain a behavior but it doesn't excuse- and it won't keep Fiance's brother out of trouble.\n\njust your kid away from him. and if that means the whole family doesn't get to see her, well that's their choice. it'll make deciding what family to see for holidays a lot easier.", "Fair enough", "NTA. \u201cThe spectrum\u201d is ZERO excuse to allow him to carry on like he has been. It is up to his parents to discipline or correct his behaviour in a way he understands. The longer this goes on without being handled, the worse it will be. He will take this behaviour to school with him too because he sees it as acceptable. Your in laws and fianc\u00e9 suck for allowing it to continue. If you catch him again, YOU speak up and when they all come at you, point out that SOMEONE has to parent him and you\u2019re apparently the only one willing to attempt to correct his behaviour.", "ESH. Stop taking your daughter to a place she gets pushed around and screamed at!", "YTA for letting that kid terrorize your daughter. The next time he approaches her in an aggressive fashion you pick her up and leave. Tell them they will not see her unless she is safe from harm and torment. Or tell them in advance but you're letting the little one get mistreated because you don't want to step on toes?\n\nThat child depends on you for her safety, security and her LIFE. Don't think about it, protect your child.", "Take a playpen and put your daughter in it. Hopefully he won't be able to get to her", "Autism doesn\u2019t excuse aggressiveness, it means parents/caregivers have to use different approaches to teach them to be gentle or to stop that behaviour. I say this from a personal perspective. My son is autistic. I have friends with autistic kids. It isn\u2019t a free pass to ignore that behaviour. I would be having a long talk with hubby about why he feels like his brother\u2019s possible autism excuses his parents from parenting.", "YTA. Protect your baby. She is still a baby.\n\nSigned, my Autistic Sibling's Sanctioned Punching Bag\n\nI wish I had a nickle every time someone told me \"He can't help it\".", "YTA for continuing to bring your daughter around this kid. Other people's hot feelings are not your problem. Your daughter's welfare is. Simply inform them that until he receives professional help for his behavior and can behave kindly, for safety reasons he can't be around your daughter. And then stick to it. He's no longer welcome in your home, and decline invitations where both he and your daughter will be present.", "NTA. Maybe stop going over there and keep your daughter home until fianc\u00e9 can protect her better.", "YTA for not protecting your daughter. Why the hell would you keep taking her somewhere where someone repeatedly hurts her? WTF?!", "why is not relevant\n\nwhat is happening to your daughter is what's relevant\n\nDoes your daughter get knocked around every time he's around her for long? Yes.\n\nthat's the end of it.", "You need to stop bringing your child around the 4 year old is what they mean. And we all agree with them.", "You're allowing it by your presence. By constantly taking her around people you know will abuse her and people you know will either do nothing or protect the bully. You **are** allowing this situation to happen.", "As parents who don't want to send him to school when he's of age, I highly doubt their narrative of the 4yo being autistic. They won't get him tested and are trying to keep him cut off from the outside world. That's a HUGE huuuuggggeeee red flag in itself. This is just shit parenting, actually it's not parenting that's creating this issue.\n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 need to have a very serious discussion on how he views parenting, because if he's totally chill sweeping this under the rug when his own kids safety is concerned, I would be terrified to learn what else he deems acceptable for how your daughter gets treated. And for the love of God, quit bringing her over there or you're just as complacent in her abuse.", "If he wants to fight to keep putting her next to a bigger stronger kid who is going to hurt and scare her, he's an asshole and an abuse enabler. Make him justify why, if nobody is willing to monitor the autistic child, your *baby* is still required to be within reach. Make him justify why he thinks it's okay to watch his own baby be hurt and not respond. \"Because autistic\" doesn't matter, because your solution is keeping her safely out of harm's way is still a solution to the problem explained but not excused by s bunch of adults too lazy to care for the child they all agree needs extra care.", "What kind of question even is this? Yes of course you should keep your child away from someone who repeatedly hurts her. Jeez.", "Yeah.", "YES! And for those in the back row\u2026\u2026 YES!", "In short: YES\n\nThis will suck, but your daughter is smaller than the child who whether because he's autistic, a bully, or has been called from on high to wage war against the small interloper in his world...has repeatedly risked your daughters well-being physically and mentally.\n\nSTOP IT.", "You need to physically protect her. It\u2019s playtime, not infant Battle Royale. Bribe him. Tell him he gets a lollipop if he doesn\u2019t make her cry. Playing together is only a good thing if they are both having a good time. Get down on the floor and play beside her with your body between hers and his. If he goes to take her toy grab the other end of the toy and say \u201cit\u2019s her turn still, you can have it after,\u201d and hand him something else with your other hand. If he has a meltdown then oh dear it is time to leave. It will not help him in the long run to not learn how to share but your daughter needs to enjoy being around him.", "Whose toys are they? His or hers?", ">He\u2019s in his room all day playing video games.\n\nWhat's wrong with that?", ">The 22 year has no adult responsibilities.\n\nThis", "That doesn't explain why it's wrong."]}
