And the autism isn't a factor here, except in that your friend doesn't notice how much this bothers you.  Autistic folks tend to appreciate clear, unambiguous communication where you say specifically how you are feeling and what you want.  \"I don't like it when the trash is over-full.  We agreed that you would take out the trash.  I am upset that the trash isn't taken out, and I want you to do that.  I don't like feeling like I an cleaning up after you and your boyfriend, so I would like the two of you to do more cleaning up after yourselves.\"", "NTA\n\nif shes capable of living on her own, she\u2019s capable of do her own stuff, look for a new roommate OP", "NTA - trying to beat around the bush or drop subtle hints that you need her to do chores might not work if she is autistic. you might have to ask directly for her to do things, that be if you are willing to do so. i sometimes find that asking someone to do something instead of them just doing it when it needs to be done can be just as exhausting as doing it myself. i wish you luck on figuring out if you want to continue this housing situation", "NTA, dependent on how you approach this.\n\nMy experience with folks on the spectrum is that subtle just does not work. At all. They need clear and firm communication, clear statements! Executive functioning can also be tricky:  they see the bin is full, for example, but the connection between \"bin full\" and \"I should empty that\" just doesn't quite click sometimes!\n\nI would try sitting down with your roommate and having a firm but KIND to start conversation. Try to keep away from accusing statements if you can: tell her YOU'VE been feeling overwhelmed and burned out lately, YOU'VE been struggling to keep up with everything, and ask her DIRECTLY if she can help, and how she is willing to help. Make a clear list of chores and who does what, if that would help you both! This is the approach a family friend has with their ASD son and it works SO much better for them all :)\n\nAs for the boyfriend, yeah that's gonna be a whole other conversation I think. One step at a time!", "NTA. As roomates I think it\u2019s known that chores are supposed to be split evenly, so the fact you\u2019ve given her one chore and shes not doing it is a little concerning. If the boyfriend has practically moved in he can help out too.", "NTA but you need to be clearer, set clear rules e.g. you take the  bins out every 2 days, washing up is done before bed daily etc", "Ok, to be clear, you are NTA for what you want, but YTA for expecting she\u2019s going to get it.  As a parent of an autistic child, clear communication is key.  It needs to be explicit, and you can ask her what kinds of prompts help.  Important that all neurodiverse people are different.  So ASK her.\n\nSo if this was my ten year old, she does really well on time based routine.  So if x has to be done on a Friday, she will set an alarm, get up, do it, then go back to bed, and sleep until the next alarm.   But\u2026.last person who ate the biscuit in the pack throws out the empty pack? Will not register.  \nSo I explicitly tell her, and she\u2019s fine with that.  But does much better to give her a task she mentally makes time for, not one based on a prompt that could be inconvenient (I.e. taking out the rubbish when it\u2019s raining).\n\nShe will care that you are struggling, but you will need to be very clear in your communications and not speak around the issue.", "I'd try talking to her and asking what would help her remember. We have a chore list on the fridge for my kids for some items, and we have an Alexa that announces some of them - like Tuesdays at 8 pm it tells him the trash needs to go to the curb. There's no way he or I would remember that once a week. Same with the recycling every other week. Help her put systems in place to get the chores done \ud83d\udc4d", "ESH. She needs to do more chores. You need to communicate and not assume you need to walk on eggshells because your roommate is on the spectrum. Chore assignment and enforcement are always difficult conversations to have with roommates, but I actually think you would be better served by being MORE direct with your roommate -- X, Y, and Z are your chores and A, B, and C are mine. Right now you're babying her a little bit in a way that she doesn't seem to have asked for and is only increasing your frustration.", "NAH.  You know you created this mess, right?  You chose not to speak up!  It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2018s lazy, on the spectrum or forgot\u2014you can\u2019t control her behavior.  Just your own.  write up a cleaning schedule with her chore, day and name.  Post it on the refrigerator and bring her over to see it.  Verbally confirm it with her.  If that doesn\u2019t work look for a new living arrangement or buy a maid outfit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if your roommate is autistic, you very clearly expressed how she needed to step up and start helping you out with cleaning. Yet, she still continues to slack off. That isn't autism, that is laziness.", "NTA she either needs to pull her weight or move out (and the BF defintly needs to be thrown out if he's not paying rent)", "NTA. As a father of a boy on the spectrum, i know living with such a person is difficult. First, realize that she doesn't ignore your wishes conciously. She doesn't try to upset you on purpose. She is 19, so most likely she developed strategies to organize her life as needed. Sit together and see which of these strategies could be applied to her chores. As already being said, a clear schedule might work for some chores, maybe not for all.\n\nIt is important that you acknowledge her challenges she faces and you like to work with her to make this work. Be clear and direct in your speech, use clear definitions, avoid anything that could be open to even the slightest way of interpretation.\n\nIt is solvable but not the way you're probably used to, prepare for some learning for both of you.", "Sounds like you've been trying so hard to accept her as autistic that you ended up kind of infantilising her, by not expecting her to be able to share in the chores. Or it's your standard conflict aversion... Either way it ends up biting you in the ass because your resentment builds up and without communication it will ruin the relationship.\n\nShe did seem open to helping and upset that she wasn't pulling her weight, but without a way to measure what \"helping more\" means it might not even be you're talking about the same things. So I guess both should be taking more responsibility for communicating your needs in a practical way to make sure you can meet expectations, but I don't think anyone's an AH yet. NAH.\n\nDefinitely divide up the chores for sure, just don't make a schedule yourself and merely point it out to her - you are roommates and adults, and you can sit down together and divide up the tasks, and set a schedule for when it is reasonable to have them done. She can and absolutely should be a part of setting expectations and then she can share what she might struggle with and how you can help each other with your weak spots, without you taking on more than your share of the work. She's not a baby. She might need to do things differently (like do the shopping online, or have set days for cleaning instead of just \"when needed\", or even body doubling where you both do your separate tasks at the same time) but she can still do them just as well.\n\nDon't be afraid to say what you want, or ask what she needs. Autism is not shameful, and unless you talk about it you won't know exactly how it affects her.\n\nAnd absolutely talk about the bf not being over so much, but make it a separate conversation for a different day. No need to overwhelm yourselves with all at once. If either of you get too agitated you can ask for a break in the conversations and decide to continue talking in 20 min or an hour or tomorrow evening at six.", "Having lived in a similar situation ( I'm not sure if my roommate was autistic, but in retrospect, he was definitely on the spectrum), I'd say that the best approach is to clearly communicate your issues as non confrontationally as possible, divide a list of housekeeping chores, and in my case, what was most helpful was making a weekly schedule for the chores. E.G., not 'take out the trash weekly', but 'take out the trash on Tuesday and Friday '. \n\nPost the schedule on the refrigerator.", "NTA but everyone in the comments saying \"she's capable of living on her own,\" etc do not get autism. She might NOT be capable of living on her own without more structured support. She has a disability and might be floundering. \n\nMaybe it is just laziness or selfishness, I don't know. But it's worth having a roommate meeting about and coming up with a schedule with dates and times things should be done by. As a roommate you shouldn't have to babysit her through chores, but making a clear plan to divide up work is a normal roomie thing. Do not expect her to get environmental cues especially if you haven't discussed them before. Also, if you want to be kind, take time to ask if there are chores that are sensory nightmares for her-- you can decide if you want to take her most hated chores OR suggest she finds coping mechanisms to split those up too (gloves for dishes and trash, headphones for vacuuming, etc). \n\nIf she's STILL struggling even with clear expectations and guidelines, then it's either that she doesn't care or (more likely) she needs some third-party like a social worker helping her manage adult responsibilities so it doesn't fall on roommates. Even autistic people without comorbid intellectual disabilities or delays can struggle with execution of routines and self-care.", "NTA. They are just a lazy dipshit, this is not autism.\n\nnext time it happens, take the shit they did not do and throw it in their room", " Nta she's using you and you are enabling her. Make a list of chores and who needs to do what on which days and stick to it.", "Use your words.

In your post you mention saying something to her ONCE in SIX MONTHS. It\u2019s her first time away from home, first time with a roommate instead of parents, she\u2019s on the spectrum, she has a BF (possibly another first) all of this means there should be MORE communication. She\u2019s not gonna magically change. You say in a few comments she\u2019s a dear friend, then treat her as such!! Make a chore chart, clarify how you as a household want to handle romantic partners, establish written rules she and you both can agree to and fall back on. If she continues to not clean up after herself then don\u2019t renew the lease- not all friends (in fact most friends don\u2019t) make good roommates.", "YTA to yourself for letting this slide for so long", "Thank you. Ill try again and be more clear this time", "Autism is a factor in keeping things clean for me in the following ways: 1) I\u2019ll do anything on earth to avoid vacuuming as the noise is a nightmare (I also struggle with noise from the washing machine and dishwasher so I\u2019ll just switch those on right before I go out), and 2) I often don\u2019t notice dirt building up because it just blends into \u2018how things look\u2019 for me. So I don\u2019t notice the house becoming dirty, I just wake up one day in a dirty house and I\u2019m like, \u2018ah, shit, it\u2019s happened again.\u2019\n\nHowever it\u2019s being very generous to suggest these might be factors for the housemate if she has never mentioned it and doesn\u2019t seem to make any effort to work around that (e.g. I\u2019ll sweep the kitchen floor with a dustpan and brush regularly instead of vacuuming it). She\u2019s young and hasn\u2019t lived away from her parents before so it\u2019s understandable that she doesn\u2019t already have workarounds or awareness\u2026 but once OP has spoken to her about it, it\u2019s on her to do that.\n\nYWNBTA, OP.", "\"Overfull\" is an adjective subject to interpretation.

Ill see if we can write up a schedule that works. Thank you", "Split the chores, give her a list of the ones she needs to be doing. Stop being her maid.", "DO NOT clean up after her and her boyfriend. It only re-enforces that you will do it and they can leave behind a mess. Split the chores equitably. She doesnt just take out the trash but she has to do half of the cleaning. And dont re-sign a lease with her. She clearly is not capable of being a proper roommate yet.", "You could make a list and agree to which chores each of you will do. Post the list on the fridge or somewhere that makes sense. That way, the agreement is clear and can be referenced any time. (I grew up in a family where housework caused abuse. It\u2019s still emotionally fraught for me, but therapy\u2019s helped a lot. That said, when I lived with people, having the list helped take any emotion out of the issue and made things much easier!)", "I mean overfull really isn't up to interpretation. If your trash.can is so full, you cannot fit anymore and are stacking your trash somewhere else, then it's obviously time to take the trash out because it's too full.", "Oh why thank you! Have some in return! \ud83e\udd47", "NTA\n\nSomeone's condition, whatever it may be, is no reason not to address a problem. If they are struggling because of said condition/trait, they can say so. Refraining because she's autstic or has insert-any-condition-or\\_\\_\\_diverse-here is a sort of reverse ableism. Treat her like the adult she is.", "Honestly, if you can get out of the lease or find a new housemate, that\u2019s the best option. Why torture yourself trying to teach someone else to adult when you could be housemates with another adult instead?", "I kind of agree with you, but\n1. \"It's obviously time\" is exactly the sort of mental trap that's going to frustrate everyone involved, and,\n2. \"Overfull\" is linguistically ambiguous enough that it could easily mean \"More full than I like\" or \"Full over the sides.\"\n\nWhen dealing with people that struggle with ambiguity and with subjective communication, it's worth making an extra effort to avoid confusion.", "You have a point, but I also get u/throwaway04072021's point - if you are autistic, or ADHD, or just generally oblivious, or just not used to thinking of it, you may have gotten used to \"trash goes in the general vicinity of the trash can\", and it may take time to re-train oneself.\n\nSource: I genuinely don't see clutter in piles on the floor the way my wife does.  Sometimes we reorganize things onto shelves and stuff -- still with a lot of stuff and definitely needing weeding which we totally will do one of these days as we have been saying since the 20th century -- and she looks visibly relieved and more relaxed, and I can't see a difference.\n\nSo training yourself to seeing actual messes is a good thing, but having schedules where you are dealing with it regularly whether or not you personally recognize that it has to be done is also a good thing."]}
