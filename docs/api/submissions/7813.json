Because as soon as we put their dog in our car \u2026 she peed. Thankfully it was on rubber mats so easy cleanup. The first 5 minutes in our house, she peed.

Things like this are the reason why I refuse to petsit for anything that doesn't live in a tank or a cage. Because I'm not gonna run the risk of the animal turning my house into a toilet. That's why they invented kennels and doggy spas.", "NTA--sure, it put them in a rough spot, but it is not your dog and not your responsibility. And they absolutely owed you money.", "I've been in the position of a trainer and have taught people how to potty train their dogs.  What I just read doesn't sound like a potty trained dog.  Nervous, perhaps.  But it sounds like you did what you had to do to help their doggo calm down.\n\nI am willing to bet that their dog isn't nearly as well trained as they say she is.  This is the fault on them, not on the dog, and certainly not on you.  Kudos to you for being as patient as you were!\n\nFinally, let's not forget that this had already happened once before.  This is simply history repeating itself.  I feel bad for the dog, though.  She sends to be getting bad training and parentage from your \"friends\" and I have no doubt that will come back to bite them in the long run.  Figuratively, of course. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nThey misrepresented their dog. Unless you were super mean about the whole thing (which it doesn\u2019t sound like) there was no reason for *them* to be mad at *you* when it\u2019s their dog - and their failure to train said dog - that was quite literally destroying your things and peeing everywhere. \n\nI\u2019m guessing the narrative in their head is that you were horrible friends for not just putting up with it and making them find alternative care while on their trip. To them it probably \u201cwasn\u2019t even that bad\u201d. \n\nI\u2019d just forgot about them and move on.", "NTA. Maybe next time they'll take a shorter trip and use the money they save to get their dog boarded in a kennel with professionals who are trained to handle this stuff, rather than alienate their friends.", "NTA, as a dog owner, they're responsible for finding appropriate accommodations for their dog. For a dog with toileting issues, that would mean a professional kennel.", "INFO:  \nWhat breed is the dog?  \n\nBarring the dog being a working dog who needs enormous amounts of exercise, NTA.  \n\nI suspect they very well knew their dog stress pees and/or isn't well trained.   You were the second choice on her list and it's doubtful that the third sitter had any better luck than the first two.  \n\nBest to board dogs with those kinds of issues.   They get a lot of outdoor time and doesn't have to wait for a human to let them out to go  pee.  \n\nOh, and they definitely owed you the money.   They said the dog was well trained and they were wrong/lied.   Their responsibility for damages.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
