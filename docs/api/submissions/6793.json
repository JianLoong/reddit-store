D however doesn't think we should be paying even more for food when we're already paying so much, and the alcohol is cooked off so it should be fine for A. \n\nA said he's not comfortable eating any dish using an alcohol base, which is completely understandable, so I've told D it's just one dish and it would make A feel included and welcome. If not, then we should've had the veg option as non alcoholic. \n\nD said she's understands A, but it's not up to us to accommodate his requests.

Go pay the extra fee and be done with this discussion.", "NTA\n\nYour fiancee is making this into a friend vs me competition why? This is a pretty simple request from your friend that any good host should be happy to accommodate.

And in islam if you don't do the prayers you have to do it again in our branch or pay some one to do it its like a debt or certain things makes plates so dirty you have to wash it 7 times or with soil .

It is very nice to welcome your muslim friend by accomodating his dietary requirements. I don't really know about D, though. I don't think it is very broadminded of her.

Im assumming you are talking about halal? The veg option would be much cheaper.", "NTA. You are doing the right and kind thing to ensure that your friend can feel fully included in your celebration. This is a really strange issue for your fianc\u00e9 to turn into a \u201cthem or me\u201d situation. It\u2019s your party so yeah, it is up to you to accommodate your guests\u2026??", "NTA.  Is you want your friend there, as the hosts, it is your responsibility to accommodate him.  Pay the extra for the food and move on.", "NTA\n\nI think of this like any event where food is served knowing that someone has a dietary restriction.  Eating is a key part of the wedding reception and you can't extend a *sincere* invitation to your friend to join you at the reception knowing that there is no food option acceptable to them.  Without an acceptable food option they can't really accept that invitation.  The fact that its religious restriction and not like a food allergy really shouldn't matter.\n\nI think its on you and your fiance to come up with a food option that is acceptable.  Either that or don't invite this person.", "NTA.  Not making accommodations for religious restrictions would be extremely inhospitable of you as the hosts.\n\nIf you have a strong contingent of vegetarian guests, it may be worth removing the alcohol base altogether.  Alcohol doesn't fully cook off, and there are plenty of reasons for people to avoid alcohol.", "NTA. Your soon to be spouse is though. You absolutely should be willing to accommodate any dietary need for a guest, it can't be that much for a single plate. You are right, you should have chosen a dish without alcohol for the vegetarian option if paying the extra was going to be such an issue.", "Alcohol is never completely burned off and just curious, those getting the vegetarian dish - do they know alcohol is used in it? Because there may be others who may not want alcohol in their dish for one reason or another", "NTA. What sort of AH invites someone to a wedding and reception and doesn't feed them???  No, you are entirely in the right here. D is being stingy. You care enough about the person to invite them, but not enough to spend a few extra bucks to make sure they can eat? WTH? That's not a good look on your future spouse. She's willing to make someone go against their religious beliefs or go hungry to save a few dollars. Seriously. Wow. Massive AH flags from D there.", "NTA. But the caterer should accommodate that type of request without paying extra, I would also expect them to be able to provide halal meat at no extra cost, you should go back to them, it\u2019s a wedding you\u2019ll be paying them a fortune anyway, changing 1 meal is not going to massively put them out.", "NTA. D is the AH. It is literally up to you to accommodate your friend\u2019s needs. She\u2019s the guest.", "NTA, assuming that the surcharge isn't something obscene.", "NTA \n\nAnd, yes.\n\nIt is up to you to accommodate guests dietary needs when you are aware of them.", "NTA. Is your fianc\u00e9e expecting A to eat their tie? Why invite someone you're not going to accommodate for; sounds like D dislikes A", "NTA. Your fiance is being unreasonable. Your friend isn't asking for anything outrageous in accommodations. Hell, my sister who I barely talk to made sure my friend who I brought as my plus one is celiac and a vegetarian. If my sister can accommodate a total stranger to her your fiance can accommodate a friend of yours.", "NTA - Also, good on you for sticking up for your friend and their dietary requirements. Your spouse may not understand, but they can't expect your friend to consume food against their cultural rules and religious beliefs - one of those being alcohol, cooked or not.", "NTA by any means. This makes you a kind and considerate person. \nYour fianc\u00e9e needs to understand that it\u2019s literally one plate. How much of an up charge for a non-meat entree could it possibly cost that it\u2019s going to break the bank THAT badly for anyone??", "NTA. And you're a good friend on top of it.", "NTA - Yes, it is up to you to accommodate your guests. On a side note, I'm surprised that the caterer wanted to charge you extra, as providing vegetarian or vegan options is so common, they should have it available as a standard choice.", "NTA It's a simple request with a simple solution. Not sure what the problem is.", "NTA. Your fiancee is the AH for refusing to accommodate your friend.", "NTA it's completely normal to wanting to accommodate your friend's dietary requirements at your own wedding. there shouldn't be any issues!", "NTA.  Not talking big bucks here.  It's an easy enough accommodation, and it will guarantee a good time for all.  \n\nWhy is your fiance making such a huge deal out of something like this, is my big question.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding too and if you think it\u2019s a good idea to have a separate dish for your friend then so be it. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s spent some extra bucks on things you find frivolous during this process. Also btw, if she constantly is doing this \u201cit\u2019s me or them\u201d thing, major red flag. Good luck, dude.", "NTA, this seems like a power play on her part. I highly doubt one meal is going to change the bill much and being inclusive is worth the small cost difference!", ">D said she's understands A, but it's not up to us to accommodate his requests\n\nWell, yeah, it kind of is, you invited A, and \\*know\\* his dietary requirements. At this point a good host takes those requirements into account.\n\nHow much more could this be, vs. the whole cost of a wedding?\n\nIt seems to me like D wants to make an asshole of herself for the sake of what? $50?\n\nNTA, D is being obstructive here.", "Maybe the wedding planning is too stressful and it\u2019s affecting her normally kind and hospitable personality? It\u2019s possible to postpone the wedding so the couple can clear their heads and get to know each other better.", "NTA. Catering to dietary needs at weddings is pretty normal and reasonable", "I don\u2019t think there are necessarily  any assholes here. I personally wouldn\u2019t be in favor of making special accommodations for a single guest, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s worth having a huge fight over. \n\nIn D\u2019s defense, it\u2019s not that your guest **can\u2019t** eat the veg option with the alcohol cooked off - he\u2019s choosing not to. It\u2019s not an allergy or health issue. It\u2019s a religious dietary choice.  That, in my mind, is the distinction that would make me personally opt against accommodation.", "NTA, and good job looking out for your friend!", "Nta but wth is with the caterers, never heard of charging extra for dietary requirements. I had 3x coeliacs and someone allergic to shellfish at my wedding, apart from the numerous vego/vegan/pescatarians, a couple of Muslims and 2x Jewish as well. All completely no issue and none of the caterers charged extra. It's stressful enough having a wedding without this bs.", "NTA, this is a perfectly reasonable compromise. Or would he rather ask the caterer to sart preparing meat the way that they need to? Does he know how expensive that would be?", "INFO: how much money will it cost for this? If it\u2019s a reasonable amount, N T A, but if they\u2019re charging you something exhortant like over 100 for one meal, that\u2019s absurd", "Can't they just make the veggie option without alcohol full stop? Out if the billions of recipes on the planet it should be possible. \n\nThere might be other people at the wedding (pregnant women or recovering alcoholics) who don't want to be ambushed by alcohol hidden in a sauce.", "This was my first thought. The only time I've seen a slight upcharge is for meals prepared in a kosher or Halal kitchen off-premise and brought in separately, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. \n\nNTA, but this should be a non-issue for most caterers/ venues.", "Depends on the country, in my country halal would be extremely expensive and in some countries it is banned, making the extra sauce is also an additional cost, why would a caterer do it for free?", "This! \n\nIf she's that worried about the extra money, just pay the difference yourself out of personal funds. It's a bit ridiculous that she's forcing the issue to that point, but it should at least shut the histrionics down.", "Asking the important question.", "I would bet that even if they paid, the caterer would put the same sauce on A's dinner, and just say it's alcohol free.", "I live in Europe and that's not the case here. It is usually a non-issue to pay extra for extras.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I was seeing too. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to jump straight to Islamaphobia? But wondering if I said I need gluten free and dairy free would it be the same issue!", "Hard to not think it, but at the very least OP considers A an important enough friend to be willing to accommodate A\u2019s dietary restriction so that A can come. Super sus that D either can\u2019t be bothered to know or care why A can\u2019t have food cooked in acohol. Super sus that D isn\u2019t willing to be flexible.", "I know right. Caterer is probably saying flick me $10 on top of the normal meals and I\u2019ll chuck some alcohol free sauce on the boil and keep it separate. \n\nBut D is all \u201cnooooooo we can\u2019t possible bow down to that!!!!\u201d\n\nI\u2019d be digging right into this with my future husband to see what he is hiding?!?!?"]}
