The implication being it\u2019s stupid to bring a bag back out after many years & it\u2019s something really hilarious & embarrassing. \n\nI ended up announcing to all the people nearby in a melodramatic fashion to make sure you never re-wear anything around said relative as she never forgets what you wear. Relative went quiet, looked embarrassed & almost like she was going to cry. \n\n\nINFO - \n\nI did take the bag out after many years, it was \u201con trend\u201d at the time I bought it, not so much anymore, but I still like it & felt like using it. And despite what she thinks I didn\u2019t use it much back then, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s quite a distinctive colour & memorable. It was in perfect condition still.\n\nThis relative has a track record of doing this, I\u2019d assume she does it to everyone but I can only comment on my experience. She\u2019s previously reacted the same way to a jacket I was wearing saying I\u2019ve had that for so many years & laughing loads in a gathering again. Next time she saw me in a similar setting I was wearing a new jacket & she laughed loads commenting loudly saying I\u2019ve bought a new jacket just because of her comments. \n\nShe\u2019s commented several times like that about things I\u2019m wearing for a long time or re-wearing after a long time. Once I was gifted something & she said you\u2019ll just keep wearing that forever now. She once laughed at my shoes saying they\u2019re so funny because it was a type of shoe style she hadn\u2019t personally come across yet. \n\nI\u2019m the kind of person that keeps up with fashion somewhat but I also treasure good finds, so I\u2019ll wear good quality old favourites a lot, or keep a gem that is timeless (or I love irregardless) forever & bring it out every now & again. Whilst I think she thinks fashion is only cyclical & you buy, wear & get rid after a certain time, hence she finds it really significant to see me re-wearing anything after a longer period. She doesn\u2019t actually care about being fashionable herself, just likes to have new fast fashion which are mostly sensible comfy everyday items. \n\nI also always get comments from her if I\u2019m wearing something new/different/on trend - loud, almost mocking tone of \u201cI\u2019ve *NEVER* seen you wearing something like that before\u201d & waiting for me to give an \u201cexplanation\u201d. It almost feels like if I do wear something she thinks is in fashion/new she has to also mock it somehow & take away from it by pointing it out in a humiliating way in public again.

Good for you.", "My girlfriend, family, and a boatload of people say I look homeless because my clothes. I have clothes from when I was 15. I don't get rid of clothes unless I literally can't wear them. I don't get people that wear things once and then never again. I will wear clothes till they disintegrate.

As I said in my OP she\u2019s not even fashionable & isn\u2019t trying to be either, she doesn\u2019t have an interest in clothes other than wearing new & comfy clothes from fast fashion places only.

I think that it happens to be about your different views of fashion is almost secondary. She's picking on you like a mean girl.

It is fair to react to her public ridicule but you had opportunities to talk to her in private and correct behavior earlier", "It hadn\u2019t got to me this badly yet, you know you figure someone\u2019s said a shady comment & try to ignore it & get on with your life. And this was also one of the worst & a bigger \u201cscene\u201d she made.", "I understand, But is it possible that she did not understand how her comments affect you?", "Wtf? Her behavior is ridiculous. I wouldn't even notice if a relative started using an old bag again and if I did it would be like 'brooo, you still have that? Awesome!'\n\nBtw, OP now I wanna know what bag it is.", "NTA. Your relative is being a snob. The reality is that well made garments are supposed to last for years. There are many styles that are timeless. Maybe if she would invest instead of buying fast fashion crap she would get a few more wears out of her clothes.", "NTA you just drew attention to her behavior. If she finds her own behavior humiliating, perhaps she shouldn't do it", "NTA\n\nWhat a strange reaction to laugh at someone reusing clothes and accessories...\n\nTo be fair, in my head im picturing someone having a harty laugh like, \"Haha, you wore this same bag 3 years ago.. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\" feels like, does she have absolutely nothing joyous or funny going on in her life that this is whats hilarious to her...", "NTA I would start collecting info on the environmental impact of fast fashion, microplastics caused by cheap fabrics, the tenancy for fast fashion to use child labour and give them to her any time she makes a comment or you re wearing things.", "NTA\n\nIf the relative can't handle your, fairly innocuous, comments she should've kept her gob shut. You showed restraint, I might've been a bit mean in your place.", "Not going to lie - I misread the start of the story in sleepiness and was imagining a laughing bag.", "You're NTA.  Relative is.  Good for you for speaking up.  \n\nRelative is being a jerk, and you don't need to put up with that.  Why is she obsessed with your clothing?  Is she heavier than you are?   Are  her clothes plainer, cheaper, less pulled together?   She just can't get you off her mind!  \n\nI'd be tempted to make fun of her right back and keep it up, talking right over her.  Look up put-downs online or in a library.  You'll find something that fits her.  \n\nBut really, I think she just can't get you out of her head.  She's obsessed with you, so what is she missing in her own life?", "NTA - Every time you see this person, immediately comment on what they are wearing. Just GUSH, over the top, about it like it, was the most fashionable thing that ever came off the runway. doesn't matter what they are wearing. Their hair. Their nails. Their bag. Their makeup. Do it. Over the top. \n\nBeat this person at their game. \n\nExtra points if you can make it a back handed compliment.", "Not french not Chic and not following every trend either but I wear the stuff I like and is in good condition.

That never happens to me, I always think of the perfect response at 3am!", "I agree.  She\u2019s not a snob, she\u2019s just plain mean and OP would be justified if they put on a bewildered, hurt face, and said, \u201cWhy are you always so mean to me about my clothes?\u201d\u2014loud enough for everyone to hear.  Make the mean girl have to explain herself in a group setting.  She\u2019ll try, of course, but no one there will buy it."]}
