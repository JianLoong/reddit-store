She and her husband Jim (30m) and their 2 kids (6m, 3f) moved into my house at the beginning of March. They are renovating their house and asked to stay for 6 weeks.\n\nI have 3 spare bedrooms so everyone had their own space. I had only one rule for them, to let my dog alone, not to let the kids chase him and not open the gates, so he can bling the stairs.\n\nMy dog Blake just recently underwent hip joints replacements and but he has also polyarthritis, so overall swelling of the joints. He takes medication for it everyday and needs a lot of rest.\n\nFirst week went ok I only had to remind the kids a few times not to chase Blake. By second week I got a lot of snark remarks about how much I'm spending on my damn dog. That I should just put him down and spend the money on their kids. The treatments were and are still extremely expensive but my dog is only 5 and deserve a chance at a long life. Most importantly he has a chance at full recovery but it will take some time and lot of physiotherapy. And also they are well off so not sure why she needs my money too.\n\nI let the comments slide but they kept screaming at him to move , like they deliberately went to place he kept resting, just so they could tell him to move. Knowing it's hard for him to get up and move away fast. I told them to stop so many times but they just kept at it. \n\nThe last straw was when I put Blake on the couch , the corner is his favorite spot because the sun shines there through the window there and it's also good for his bones, and I saw my BIL from the kitchen how he pushed Blake from the couch. Blake started whining from pain and as I rushed to the living room I started screaming at BIL. I went to Blake to check him over and I told my BIL what a piece of shit he is. My sister came down and when I told her what happened, she started screaming at me, for saying that to her husband.\n\nI had enough and told them to pack their bags and get out of my house immediatly. They called me a bunch of names and told me they will never speak to me again.\n\nI took Blake to the vet just to make sure everything was all right and during that time I was flooded with calls and texts from my family about  what an awful person I am. When I called my mom back, she scolded me that I picked my dog over my sister and her family and that I should apologize , otherwise my sister will never speak to me again. Then she hung up without saying goodbye. Only my dad is on my side and said my sister's act was selfish and stupid.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1680122312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125zzor/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_and_her_family_out_of/", "score": 447, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She and her husband Jim (30m) and their 2 kids (6m, 3f) moved into my house at the beginning of March. They are renovating their house and asked to stay for 6 weeks.\n\nI have 3 spare bedrooms so everyone had their own space. I had only one rule for them, to let my dog alone, not to let the kids chase him and not open the gates, so he can bling the stairs.\n\nMy dog Blake just recently underwent hip joints replacements and but he has also polyarthritis, so overall swelling of the joints. He takes medication for it everyday and needs a lot of rest.\n\nFirst week went ok I only had to remind the kids a few times not to chase Blake. By second week I got a lot of snark remarks about how much I'm spending on my damn dog. That I should just put him down and spend the money on their kids. The treatments were and are still extremely expensive but my dog is only 5 and deserve a chance at a long life. Most importantly he has a chance at full recovery but it will take some time and lot of physiotherapy. And also they are well off so not sure why she needs my money too.\n\nI let the comments slide but they kept screaming at him to move , like they deliberately went to place he kept resting, just so they could tell him to move. Knowing it's hard for him to get up and move away fast. I told them to stop so many times but they just kept at it. \n\nThe last straw was when I put Blake on the couch , the corner is his favorite spot because the sun shines there through the window there and it's also good for his bones, and I saw my BIL from the kitchen how he pushed Blake from the couch. Blake started whining from pain and as I rushed to the living room I started screaming at BIL. I went to Blake to check him over and I told my BIL what a piece of shit he is. My sister came down and when I told her what happened, she started screaming at me, for saying that to her husband.\n\nI had enough and told them to pack their bags and get out of my house immediatly. They called me a bunch of names and told me they will never speak to me again.\n\nI took Blake to the vet just to make sure everything was all right and during that time I was flooded with calls and texts from my family about  what an awful person I am. When I called my mom back, she scolded me that I picked my dog over my sister and her family and that I should apologize , otherwise my sister will never speak to me again. Then she hung up without saying goodbye. Only my dad is on my side and said my sister's act was selfish and stupid.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
