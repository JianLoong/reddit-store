She\u2019s such a smart girl, and she\u2019s so incredibly sweet. She likes stickers, and bugs, and anything that comes in the color pink. Her mom, my sister Hayley (30f), got her a plush rosy maple moth (?) for her birthday a few years ago and I\u2019ve never seen her without it before.\n\nShe\u2019s very particular about her moth, she hand washes him, sits with him while he hang dries, seriously she loves that thing to pieces.\n\nMy mom (54f) feels that Hayley coddles Leda far too much, and babies her more than she should. Because Leda is 12 now, mom also thinks that she\u2019s getting too old to still be \u201crefusing to speak\u201d and to be carrying a moth toy around.\nHayley and I have both explained to our mother that Leda being selectively mute isn\u2019t something that she can be forced out of and she\u2019s not doing it out of malice anyway. Also she\u2019s 12 so who cares if she carries a toy around for comfort.\n\nMom and Hayley argue about it quite a bit, so things are usually icy between the two of them for a little while after one of those discussions.\n\nRecently, our mom has been staying with me at my apartment because her house is being painted and she just didn\u2019t want to stay at home with the paint fumes.\nDue to Hayley\u2019s job, when she had to work later than usual, I\u2019ll pick Leda up and look after her until my sister comes to take her home.\nMy mom staying with me means that she\u2019s been seeing Leda more often (Hayley knows this and okayed it), which has lead to her making a few comments in passing that I\u2019ve either shut down or just ignored.\n\nToday, I went to pick up some takeout after Leda and I had been home for a little while. She didn\u2019t want to ride to get it with me, and the place is just down the street so I thought she\u2019d be fine with my mom for 10 minutes.\n\nWhen I got back with the food, Leda was in tears and my mom was holding the moth toy. I asked what was going on and my mother asserted that Leda was too old for that \u201cthing\u201d and she needed to act like a big girl and get over it.\n\nI got the toy back to Leda and told my mom to get her stuff packed because I was taking her to a hotel.\nI didn\u2019t listen to her as she tried to defend what she did, I just booked the room and got her an Uber.\n\nShe left but she was pissed about it. She said that the way I handled the situation was ridiculous and that I\u2019m horrible for going to the extreme and throwing her out like that.\n\nI feel bad because maybe the hotel thing was a little impulsive and I could\u2019ve done something different, but I didn\u2019t want her there with Leda anymore.", "created_utc": 1673405147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108tay8/aita_for_getting_my_mom_a_hotel_room_instead_of/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I ended up replacing most of the books, and as an adult, I have a library of between 600 and 700 books.  I struggle with paring back because of it being painful in the past; it\u2019s hard for me to sort through things and decide what is actually worth keeping because I\u2019ll use it again, because I have a fairly deep-seated feeling that I\u2019ll want it someday and be upset I don\u2019t have it.", "NTA-glad Leda has you for an aunt (as I\u2019m sure your sister is too).
