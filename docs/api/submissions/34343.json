You make no excuse for why you were incapable of removing them, especially when you were aware you'd already annoyed at least one person by not recognising them correctly. I'll go ahead and assume you are not actually handless, since otherwise it would be silly for her to instruct you to press a call button, so you actively chose to not bother despite knowing you had already been corrected on exactly the same thing you were about to risk. \n\nYou offer no reason for why you felt it would be more appropriate to interrupt another patient's care for something that was not worth you making the outstanding effort of pressing the call button. If your mother was literally dying and needed emergency attention, yes, shout at anyone nearby, but otherwise press the button (or walk to the station if you have an actual reason for disliking the thing literally designed to get the attention you wanted).\n\nYou admit yourself that it is your sexism that means you assume all female medical staff are nurses.
