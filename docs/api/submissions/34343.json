I might be downvoted into oblivion, but let me explain -\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the setting. OP says that the problem occurred at night, and we can assume that this means the lights are off. It\u2019s a bit more difficult to see specific features at night (especially when she clarified that her vision was so poor that she couldn\u2019t see the name tag, which I believe are generally larger to easily identify hospital personnel) since the lights are probably off to allow the overnight patients to sleep. \n\nSecond, OP clarifies in an edit that the doctor had only clarified her position *once*. I think in this case, both parties had a little bit of trouble seeing in the dark and possibly mistook the other for someone else. The doctor is understandably upset because she\u2019s tired of being misidentified as a nurse (most likely due to her gender) and also is likely overworked. However, it seems as though she also didn\u2019t recognize who she was talking to and mistook OP for another person who has mistaken her for a nurse multiple times. \n\nThird, I see a lot of people pointing out that the doctor should be easily recognizable to OP since she\u2019s taking care of her mom. Unless I missed something, it actually isn\u2019t stated that this doctor specifically was in charge of her mom\u2019s care. \n\nA lot of my judgement relies on giving OP the benefit of the doubt, but honestly it seems like a misunderstanding from both parties because of the stress of the situation and visibility. I also want to bring up that it is very possible OP waited until the doctor looked like she was done tending to the other patient before getting her attention. \n\nOn another note, it is definitely an AH move to interrupt a medical professional when they\u2019re working with another patient.
