I F has been staying at my boyfriends M house for a few weeks now, I have been staying here due to the fact that I have been having trouble with my academics since I got in to one of the universities in my country hardest unis - basically I needed a lot of help from him since he\u2019s more knowledgeable. So, we were eating ramen at the dining area and my boyfriend\u2019s sister in law 24f talked to me for the first time; she told me stuff like, \u201c us women should be the ones washing dishes, so don\u2019t be afraid to wash the dishes. \u201c * I grew up in an household where we don\u2019t let visitors wash any dishes as respect, but if I knew she wanted me to do the dishes - I would have. I asked them before if they wanted me to do it but my boyfriend\u2019s dad kept telling me off and to just sit so I grew accustomed to that. \u201c whenever we\u2019re at the dinner table you always eat quietly and kept using body language for water, you barely talk. \u201c * reason being i was still very shy and I always am quiet whenever eating. I used body language to ask my boyfriend for water. She kept pestering me to drink alcohol even when I did not want to - I hated the alcohol they drink because of the taste, I have always disliked it. I always give in though since she doesn\u2019t want me to decline. But if they chose something else I would have drank with them. When I kept declining, she kept insisting that I was pregnant and that I shouldn\u2019t worry about what she was making me drink brcause I would not get \u201c fat \u201c in her words unless I was pregnant, I was in the verge of tears the whole time due to the harsh words she was telling me and inappropriate words like, \u201c do you moan during s*x? i bet you don\u2019t since you\u2019re always so quiet. \u201c That made me even more so uncomfortable since we were the girls in the group with my boyfriends cousins more resulting me into being more quiet except for my occasional answers to be more respectful and occasional laughs towards her \u201c jokes \u201c I became even more quieter to hold back my tears, She noticed I was quieter since I was just poking my ramen and basically not eating she said, \u201c do want me to hand feed you? talk i\u2019m not trying to scare you. \u201c. When her boyfriend arrived she kept mentioning that I was \u201c pregnant \u201c subtly, laughing. My boyfriends cousin noticed that she keeps putting me in a tough spot so they kept talking to her to distract her from me. I excused myself to the bathroom to \u201c vent \u201c or in other words cry with my boyfriend comforting me because beforehand I told him what I was feeling, before I left she got upset with me and said why I wasnt responding to her and saying I was killing the fun.\n\n* I couldn\u2019t leave because they moved to drink at my boyfriends room", "created_utc": 1667171899, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhtiob/aita_for_not_responding_to_my_boyfriends_sister/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
