He\u2019s been dating Cora (24F) for 6 months now. She\u2019s a sweet girl and I like her a lot.

He lives on his own, but we meet up at least once a month for lunch, he\u2019ll come visit me and I him, etc. I totally understand want him to have his own life. I have my own too. But still, I enjoy our time together.\n\nThe issue is, it seems whenever we do hang out, Cora always tags along. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love spending time with her. But it\u2019s just weird that we can never have time just us. I have a younger son, Toby,  who\u2019s also in a relationship. While I hang out with him and his boyfriend, I also get some one on one time with my son as well.\n\nRecently, I invited both of my sons to lunch. I said I really wanted to just have some time with them as it hasn\u2019t been that way. Toby showed up alone. Alex walked in with Cora. I tried to hide my disappointment. \n\nThe lunch went fine, though Cora kept commandeering my son\u2019s attention. So, I just sort of focused on Toby. I can tell he was equally annoyed. \n\nAt one point, I went to go do the dishes. Alex and Toby were helping while Cora took a work call outside. I asked Alex why he brought her. He said she wanted to come. Even Toby was saying \u201cCome on, bro. You can spend one afternoon away from her\u201d. Alex got really defensive and said he and Cora were a package deal.\n\nCora ended up walking in when things were in the thick of it. Toby and Alex were arguing while I was trying to defuse. Cora picked up on what was going on and started crying, asking why I don\u2019t like her. I said that\u2019s not true, but it\u2019s not healthy if they can\u2019t do anything apart.\n\nAlex and Cora ended up leaving. I got a lengthily text from Alex telling me that Cora is going to be around and I can\u2019t expect to have alone time with anymore. \n\nI truly didn\u2019t mean to hurt feelings.

NTA, but I don't know exactly how to handle this. In my experience with my family it was completely normal for me to get together once in a while with just my mom ... no husbands or boyfriends around. The men in my life never blinked twice about my saying, \"Going to have lunch with Mom. See you in a bit.\" Nobody ever begged to come. They liked my mother fine, my SOs and I have just never been joined at the hip that way. Cora seems like a very different deal ... I wouldn't know how to handle it. Good luck!", "Maybe I'm reliving my own trauma, but this reads to me like she's very controlling and manipulative. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship where my ex used a very similar tactic to drive a wedge between me and my family. She had prepped me with the packaged deal line and everything and would guilt trip me if I tried to do anything without her.\n\nNTA for wanting time with your boy, but please look into emotional abuse because I didn't even know it was happening when it was me and your son may need help.", "NTA.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to have some time alone with just you and your children. If it happened all the time, and you excluded their SOs, that would be a different story, but once in a blue moon is perfectly acceptable.\n\nIf Cora constantly commandeered the conversation you were trying to have, I wonder what else she controls. There's no reason why she should object to you and your son spending time together without her, so to insist that she come to *every* get-together is more than a little weird.", "Nta. Tbh I'm really wondering about Cora here and her character. Instead of getting the full situation she starts crying and accusing you of hating her even tho you've hung out happily many times together? She sounds manipulative from that little scene tbh. Your son is ridiculous as well, the whole package deal crap is just that, crap. It's not weird as they get more serious to see her more and more frequently, but he can't let her do her own thing while he has lunch with his mom and brother for a couple hours? That's ridiculous. \n\nThat being said,  you're not likely to win this battle. Don't bend over for this gf, but expect her to be present as long as they're together.", "I'm about your age and even now, both hubby and I have alone time with our parents And we both encourage this to the point that hubby had dinner the other night with just him, his father and sister.  I'm all for it.\n\nIt sounds like Alex and Cora are still in the honeymoon phase.  That may taper off soon.  In the mean time, you may want to reach out to Cora quietly and apologise for the misunderstanding.  Tell her you love her dearly, but once in a while would like to have one on one with Alex and it's got nothing to do with her.", "INFO: is this his first relationship?", "NTA. Why don't you try this tactic: invite Cora for occasional one-on-one activities without Alex. Then it won't seem so strange to them to invite Alex alone for things as well.\n\nBut yes, they are not joined at the hip and shouldn't be.", "NTA- It's normal to want some time with your kids, you should have spoken to him beforehand about it tho, everyone on these AITA posts are horrible communicators :P", "NTA! She should be ok with him having some time with you and his brother. It\u2019s kind of weird that she even wanted to come knowing that his brother\u2019s significant other wasn\u2019t coming. Having lunch together here and there is completely fine and normal-  especially if you do other things that involve the both of them and treat her kindly then. They will get over it. One day when she has adult kids, she\u2019ll understand too.", "NTA, the idea that he is never going to be alone without her is incredibly weird. It\u2019s literally a dinner with your sons. The idea that they are always together forever at all times is just\u2026kinda sad to me. If this was like a big birthday or holiday that would be totally different. Sorry you gotta deal with this random nonsense.", "NAH\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want alone time with you, apparently. Just don\u2019t push it.", "NTA.  You asked a reasonable question.  Your sons were arguing when Cora overheard.\n\nCora sounds really needy.  The clinginess will hopefully become obvious to your son soon.  If not, this is what he wants and you will need to figure out how to manage it.\n\nBeing a package deal shouldn't mean that one can't do things without the other.", "I was so ready to say you\u2019re TA, but NTA. You don\u2019t hate his girlfriend or resent him having one - you just want time to catch up with your son alone now and again. I agree- it\u2019s not healthy for them to be inseparable.\n\nThat said, I feel like it would have been better to bring it up at a different time, maybe by calling later, rather than trying to squeeze in a sensitive conversation with his girlfriend in the other room.", "I'm going to go with no one is TA.  You just all have different expectations. And these expectations conflict. But that's the way people are.  It is reasonable for you to want one on one time with your son.  It is also reasonable for him and Cora to prefer spending time together.  \n\nA frank, respectful and open discussion between you and Alex alone, in which each of you really took the opportunity to listen to each other might very well have come up with a resolution that you would both find acceptable.  Unfortunately this is not what happened and feelings are hurt all around. I think the mistake here was A) not making it clear to Alex that you wanted to talk about something with him alone, and B) including his brother.  Hopefully this can be patched up when everyone cools down. Pay special attention to mending fences with Cora.", "NTA.  I think it's important to maintain a relationship with your kids as individuals and not just as a couple.\n\nI encourage my spouse to visit his mother by himself and I make sure I get some \"alone time\" with my son.\n\nI wonder if you could meet up for lunch with him during the work day?   \n\nOnce a month is not unreasonable for a short visit with your son alone if you live in the same town.\n\nHis girlfriend sounds very insecure.", "Always should have time for the bros", "You can want it, but it doesn't appear that is going to happen for sometime unless they choose not to date anymore. I know you wouldn't wish that for him.", "My (25f) MIL has 4 boys (all mid-late 20s, all married) - Ever since I met my MIL I have been invited to everything! Lunches, dinners, weddings, family reunions, vacations, etc. it was really nice to always be included. Because of this, we have all gotten really close and want to spend time with each other as a family. I think any of the girls would be sad to hear that she was disappointed that we came to something (to be fair if she did request a boys only lunch or dinner every once in a while I wouldn't care or have hurt feelings, she just hasn't). \n\nWe have our own lives, and spend time away from our spouses because of school, work or friends. But usually if both of us are free for a \"family event\" a couple times a month that is something we will go together. I don't think that's weird. \n\nI am going to say NTA, your request doesn't seem malicious. I would just remember that eventually girlfriends and boyfriends turn into DILs and SILs. They will remember how you treat them in the beginning. Pushing away significant others can also push away your sons.", "Cora sounds incredibly insecure but if Alex is fine with it, then you'll just have to accept it I guess.", "NTA. You asked your son for a family lunch with just your sons. Not like you asked him to go on a 4 week sabbatical. Your son and his gf's attachment to each other is unhealthy long term. A couple has to be able to be apart from one another without one of them getting upset.", "NTA.  It's great to still get one on one time with people we care about.  It's a red flag for me if a SO doesn't allow alone time.  Hopefully it's just a honeymoon stage and it will pass.", "NTA, but it may be time to accept that you won't have much alone time (if any) with your adult sons. I don't think there is anything wrong with asking your son whether you can have lunch alone every once in a while, but I think it is unlikely it will happen in reality. \n\nOne suggestion -- maybe you could reach out to Cora and explain that you like spending time with her, but you have just been missing your \"old\" little family (you and your two sons) and that you love having them together every once in a while like the old days. It sounds like (from your post) that you stated that you wanted to spend time with your son alone because it is unhealthy for him to spend time with Cora, but in reality the reason was the you just wanted some one-on-one time with your kid! It may also not hurt to ask Cora whether she'd be up for getting lunch with you one-on-one someday. It sounds like she is a new member of your family, and it might be nice to have your own relationship with her as well.", "Soft YTA- but ONLY for bringing it up during lunch when she was a few steps away.\n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to want the occasional lunch with just your children even when they\u2019re adults. \n\nBut now you will have to do a bit of damage control.\n\nI would send your son an apology and explain that you do like Cora and you enjoy her being around. I\u2019d just reiterate that you were hoping for time to see your two children and catch up. But that you understand how much he cares about her.\n\nI\u2019d also apologize to Cora and just tell her that you really do like her and enjoy having her around. Leave it at that. I\u2019d consider inviting her for a girls day, maybe get a pedicure. That way you can get to know her one on one too. (Who knows though your son might show up for pedicures too lol.) Plus if you get closer to her she might begin to understand it wasn\u2019t a \u201cslight\u201d at her. \n\nIf this is for the long haul (marriage) just be prepared that they could become a package deal forever. Good luck mama!", "NTA-being a couple doesn\u2019t mean you spend every second together.  Maybe you institute some time there\u2019s everyone and some explicitly just kids lunches.", "Nta\n\nThere was a similar problem in my family. The problem wasn't that girlfriend was always around so much as it was that her presence meant my cousin was completely distracted and withdrawn from the rest of my family. Which is cute once or twice but eventually it's simply rude. \n\nMy grandmother ended up sitting them down and telling them they were making the family feel like shit  because of how they'd practically pretend we weren't around. And it helped. \n\nSo I think you went about it badly, but I understand and agree with the reasoning", "YTA. If he did not want her there, he would not have brought her. If he wanted one on one time with you, he would probably plan it.", "NAH/ slight YTA.  It's OK for you to want time alone, but it's also ok for him to want to be a \"package deal.\"  You are slightly TA for making it awkward and making Cora feel unwelcome.", "I think ESH. Your son and his gf for obvious reasons. But you and your other son couldn\u2019t have picked a worse way to address the situation.", "YTA. You are one of those mothers in law. If you truly don\u2019t want to be, as you said, apologize. Alex is right in this case and he\u2019s sticking up for his gf. Good for him. \n\nHe and Toby are not the same person. Just because Toby and his partner spend more time apart, doesn\u2019t mean Alex and his partner will. They\u2019re just 6 months in. It\u2019s likely a very gushy love-filled time. Good for them. \n\nYou\u2019re jealous. It\u2019s not a good look.", "Gentle YTA\n\nSo... I get where you are coming from, but I think this is just a case of how relationships evolve as kids grow up, get into serious relationships, get jobs and have less time free for mom and dad, want to spend more time on their own personal interests get married, have kids of their own, etc. I wouldn't take offense with this. Your son is not a child living in your house any more. He is now a grown man and has lots of commitments. He now socializes with his partner. That's not about her controlling him, that's about him making the choice that he wants to socialize with his partner, *rather than using his free time* to have alone time with you, tough as that is to hear.\n\nSo rather than trying to guilt him about this, or make his girlfriend into the villain, I would be gracious, and just accept that he's older now, and things are going to be different, either with Cora or the next girl he dates.", "YTA for not waiting until after the lunch to bring  it up with Alex.", "YTA for bringing it up during the lunch itself and in front of another person. How else did you expect this to go?", "YTA.\n\nI can relate to this as I am the son in this same scenario. My wife and I are one, and my mother trying to put limits on that makes me not want to see you at all. More so the older I get (30+M now). The result of this will eventually be your oldest son not showing up at all, I suggest you tread very carefully here.", "I mean YTA, Cora didn't invite herself your son invited her! She only imposses in your opinion but your son clearly wants her there. If your options are seeing your son and having Cora there or not seeing him at all what will you choose? \n\nI get to you that it's annoying but your son is a grown man and if he doesn't want to give you 'alone time' he doesn't have to.", "NAH, I understand how hard it is to let go. But we\u2019re the mothers and letting go is what we have to do. I have three married sons, which to me means I now have six kids. For purely selfish reasons you need to give your daughter in law a big hug and say you\u2019re so sorry for messing up and you love her to bits. Otherwise you\u2019ll end up on - OH THE HORROR! - JustNoMIL.", "YTA! He's grown, and it sounds like it's serious. That's his decision and if you wanted ONLY him you should have made that invitation and allowed him to accept or decline. Boundaries are healthy but you can't offer passive aggressive complaints AFTER they arrive when you didn't say that she wasn't invited.", "YTA. \n\nYour son is growing up, and Cora is now a part of his life. The sooner you realize that he and Cora now come as a package with him, the sooner you can repair the relationship you have with him.", "ESH. I think next time you need to tell your son specifically that did not want the GF to come. I would also make sure to invite her to other events. \n\nYou might not have been specific enough, but your son should not need to spend every moment with his girlfriend. From your perspective it sounds like a lot of codependency, but we're outsiders looking in. For all I know they might have demanding schedules and are not able to see each other as much as they would like. \n\nYou need to get ahead of this. I would invite both of them to a lunch, and apologize for any hurt feelings for the misunderstanding. Lay it out that you really like the GF, and enjoy spending time with her. However, explain that this one time you thought you conveyed that it was only for you and your sons, and it is nothing against her. Explain that you might have wanted to reminisce about certain embarrassing moments from the boys childhood that didn't feel right about bringing up with someone who might feel excluded from the conversation.", "NTA", "NTA unless there's extensive travel involved for them. Unfortunately now if you want a relationship with him, you have make up with her. Plan something with her etc. Keep your enemies closer basically. You weren't wrong to want alone time,  you tried, but they've made it clear how their relationship will be. You can always cross your fingers that they break up", "YTA for having the discussion while you were annoyed and Cora was around.\n\nThey have only been together for six months, so I would strongly recommend patience. I would also recommend that you find some way to connect with Cora. The suggestion made here about something like a pedicure might be a good way to start.\n\nOur son and daughter-in-law have been together as a couple for well over a decade. While our daughter-in-law has always been included in invitations for get-togethers (even before they were married), we have had many occasions for \"alone time\" with our son.", "YTA, he is a grown man and he has a partner with who is the one he wants to be, and want her to be part of family gatherings, because, if the go serious, she is gonna be his family, if you can't understand that, then is your problem, not hers, not his. \n\n>, though Cora kept commandeering my son\u2019s attention\n\nSo, you're jealous, that is all, is not your son's business", "NTA but this won\u2019t get better. Mine is now married and had their first child. She is obsessed with the child and acts like it is her possession too. I told my husband that when our grandchild is older we will be the place to run. She is smothering this child and they are still an infant. \n\nWe are just patiently waiting for the fallout but my son may never leave. My mother never did but us kids ran. I feel for you but just stay in his life because he will need you at some point.", "NTA. It's controlling not to let him go anywhere alone, especially when you invite him but not her, and crying is manipulative. Cora may be abusing him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I do get that if that\u2019s the only option, so be it, but it is absolutely weird.", "It\u2019s still up?", "This is basically what I did, though. I said that I missed spending time with them and wanted to have a lunch just us. I don\u2019t know how that translates to Cora coming.", "Thanks for clarifying! I thought it might be just the excitement of a first relationship, but as he\u2019s had relationships before this is a tad unusual. I think it\u2019s normal for couples to be a package deal when they have been together for a few years, living together - but even then they should be able to spent time apart. However I think some couples don\u2019t really have boundaries between them and do see themselves as joined at the hip. When I was in college, I used to arrange to meet up with one of my gal pals, and she would always bring her boyfriend without notice. Eventually, I would have to say something explicitly ask her to not invite him along. I did feel awful saying to her not to bring him - but when she did bring him, I felt like I was crashing their date rather than him crashing my meet up with my friend.\n\nDid Cora know she wasn\u2019t expected/invited to the dinner? It\u2019s a little bit rude to turn up as an uninvited guest. Your son said she wanted to come but I\u2019m wondering if she hadn\u2019t known you\u2019d just wanted the boys there alone. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable intruding on something I knew I wasn\u2019t invited to. \n\nI do think you\u2019re NTA but to keep the peace, I would send them both a message but specifically invite his girlfriend out to do something girlie so you can have some one on one time with her and show that you\u2019re keen to get to know her. I think it\u2019s tricky for both her and you because she\u2019s probably desperate to feel accepted by your family, while you\u2019re not being able to have one on time with your son without her being somewhat involved.", "I would say her reaction is insecure. I understand the initial confusion but this is a ridiculous reaction to someone not wanting you to assume every invitation is for two.", "Agreed. OP needs to keep this between them and Alex.", "Unless she's abusive or something, she should always be welcome.", "This is why you\u2019re the asshole. It\u2019s your son\u2019s girlfriend. Either she\u2019s welcome all the time, or she isn\u2019t welcome ever.", "> As the parent of an adult son, I understand the desire to have time with your child, but it\u2019s not my child\u2019s responsibility to fill my emotional needs. \n\nIf only all parents were this enlightened.", "OP goes on and on about how they supposedly like Cora but the whole \u201cwhy did you bring her\u201d in the middle of the lunch the second Cora excuses herself for a work call seems so\u2026hostile.", "Which part did she not do?", "It is weird and seems somehow\u2026 possessive, I guess? Performative? Insecure? I\u2019m not sure. \n\nI recently lost a friend because her she always wanted to bring her bf/now-husband. We planned a girls shopping trip to a town over and when she asked if he could come too, I was floored. It wouldn\u2019t bother me so much except I can\u2019t stand him. \n\nOh well, it\u2019s her life.", "Absolutely you can :-)  \n\n\nFirst of all - I never said i can't do things without her. I absolutely can, and I do. However there was a time where my mom would ask, much like you do here, that I come alone. \n\nWhile this in it self is not a problem, having someone ask me not to bring the person I love the most, made me feel resentful. My mother apologized when I explained this eventually, and has since always invited us both. This in turn improved our relationship where I initiate time alone with her, drop by for a cup of coffee etc.\n\nTrust me when I say forcing is the same as pushing him away. Or trust your son who told you they are a package deal. You are not entitled to anyones time because you've given birth to them", "No, I will see her alone, but during the period of my life where she would ask for me not to bring the person in this world I love the most, I would not. This created resentment and I just stopped going all together. \n\nI told her how I feel (much like your son did) and she apologized and said she'd never thought of it that way. Ever since, she's invited us both to any and all occasions, which in turn improved our relationship a lot! This made me /want/ to go see my mom alone, even if just for coffee or a chat when im passing by.", "I would always assume that when I invite my daughter that she's going to be bringing the person she's seeing, because I want to see her more than I don't want to hang out with both of them.", "It\u2019s a shame you didn\u2019t realise everyone is different before you caused an argument.", "OP didn't say where Cora and son live. If they visit once a month, where are they coming from? How far apart do they live?\n\nI doN'T think it's EVERY interaction. But if it's once a month, it seems reasonable that she would also go out with his mom.  Especially if it wasn't made completely clear that it was just a mother/son thing.\n\n\\*edit: changed do to doN'T.", "\"Them\" could mean him and his brother, or him and Cora and the brother. Again, \"us\" could mean either. Be as specific as you can.\n\nI like the suggestion above - you need to be very clear in how you phrase it, so everyone is clear.  Don't make it sound like you're excluding Cora.\n\nAlso, I missed, but do they live nearby? I could see how she wouldn't want to stay home if he was coming into town for the weekend.", "No, you and your other son made it clear you didn't want her at *an event she was already at*. It would have been much less rude if you'd waited until the next lunch and asked if it could just be the three of you.", "It\u2019s easy to misinterpret especially with couples who are attached at the hip. The second line is supposed to clarify that Cora isn\u2019t invited but that it\u2019s not malicious and you still want to see her.", "she sounds like a tick, once dug in won't let go....", "Yeah, I might feel mortified if I realized I invited myself by accident, but I would apologize and say I\u2019ll go shop or something for a little while to give you some time, not start crying.", "Exactly.", "Absolutely\n\n\nAll could have been avoided by communication instead of letting things build and build until they exploded with frustration over a grievance they never expressed.\n\nIf she knew that this son was consistently bringing the girlfriend, and her intention was just a meal with her two kids..... Then she was setting everyone up for hurt feelings for not making that clear at the invite.\n\nShe knew that he would bring her, and assume the invite included her, and then got mad that he  brought her. He can't read minds.", "Nvm we're defining end of lunch differently. To me lunch was done because it was time for dishes", "Bringing it up at lunch. That was her other son.", "Indeed it is obsessive - imagine trying to control who someone else spends time with?? As if you're entitled to control who they're with? Go figure", "From what you have said it seems like there was more issues with your mom, did your mother have an issue with your partner or did she just ask to have time to see you alone? \n\nIf it is the former, that is totally fair but it doesn\u2019t sound like the situation with OP. If it is the latter, why did it you see it as such an issue? I appreciate your responses.", "So when you invite your daughter for a girls shopping trip or lunch you expect her husband to come, because that's strange to me.", "Totally fair on the distant aspect, I took once a month to mean they are relatively close, but I could be assuming. \n\nI guess it comes down to how the message was actually phrased. OP tells it like it was clearly a \u201cmom wants to see her boys\u201d kind of thing and I would take that as just me and my brother, but how it was specifically communicated is key.", "You're blowing this way out of proportion. Op has the right to want to be able to extend invites and expect them to be honoured, especially when the gf is more often than not welcome. Mom's not controlling her little boy's life like you're implying", "I feel you\u2019ve lost the plot a little here. \n\nThis isn\u2019t really a matter of control. OP isn\u2019t trying to control the son by wanting to spend time just with him, and the son isn\u2019t trying to control OP by making her spend time with Cora. \n\nIt\u2019s really more of a matter of acceptance and clear expectations. It\u2019s reasonable to want one-on-one time with people you know and love. It\u2019s reasonable to bring your SO to a generic family lunch and to want them to come along to most family functions. \n\nAn obvious solution here is for OP to communicate clearly when she wants 1-1 time, and accept that Cora will be there the rest of the time.", "Honestly it's neither one. I think she just wanted some alone time which I completely understand. But doing so by inviting me while asking not to bring my wife (or gf, when we were younger) is not the way to go about it for me and apparently not for OP's son either.\n\nThink it's important to remember that noone is entitled to anyones time, and that forcing it creates distance while open arms are inviting :)", "Probably not for a \u201cgirls shopping trip\u201d but for a lunch I\u2019d probably expect a bf/gf to tag along. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to ALWAYS come, but I wouldn\u2019t ever assume that a partner wouldn\u2019t come just because I didn\u2019t expressly invite them.\n\nIt can definitely get complicated with new relationships or couples who are always together. If I cared (if I didn\u2019t like the new partner or whatever) I\u2019d be clear about expectations.", "I wouldn't say \"let's have a girls' lunch!\". I would just invite her to lunch. She deals with a lot of anxiety, so whatever makes her more comfortable, that's the tack I take. Sometimes that means her BF. Sometimes it's her BFF. \n\nBut since she's with him so much, I would assume that inviting her means he'll come UNLESS stated otherwise.", "100% in agreement - how far apart do they live, and how was the ask made?", "LOL, I don't know what you're culture you're in and I can respect differences here, but if you expect people to be honored (???) by an invitation, while asking specifically for you not to bring your SO?... Well, that says a lot about your own ego and I can only imagine how much fun you're at parties", "Yeah I agree it is reasonable to want one on one time. \n\nI just don't think it's reasonable to expect or demand it. Forcing someone =/= pushing them away, but of course asking is allowed. Doing so repeatedly however if denied by one party will just create more and more distance", "Was there anyway to go about it correctly? Like could she have said anything that would have made you ok with seeing her alone?", "I think most people's problems when I read these posts is that they are poor communicators, the OP should have just messaged them both and said \" Hey I was hoping for a little mother/son time with you and your bother maybe get some lunch, etc\"   \n\n\nOn a side note it's unhealthy to never have time away from your SO, you can't allow him time alone with his mom and brother??", "... that's not the honoured I was using. \n\nHonouring a request is simply doing that thing. Honouring an invitation is doing what the invitation says, without changing it with no input from the person inviting you. \n\nSo to honour the invitation \"I'd like to have lunch with my sons and no one else\" the sons would attend without their partners. \n\nBut you seem just lovely yourself.", "I don\u2019t think anyone here demanded it, though. She was clearly expecting it, but because she thought the activity was a sons-only thing, but clearly her son misunderstood that. That\u2019s okay, it happens. \n\nI do actually think OP is TA here, but only because she brought it up during the lunch, in a pretty mean way, in front of the brother, causing an argument that Cora walked in on and of course felt horrible about. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for what she wants. She just needs to communicate it clearly.", "Ah right, English is not my first language, sorry about that.\n\nThat being said, I still think we'll have to agree to disagree on there being some sort of requirement to \"honour\" invitations. Saying no is always an option. And her son has made that clear I'd say?", "100% agree with your ending here and to be clear I do believe the reaction comes from a place of love.", "Harder to agree to disagree when you already insulated me because you got something wrong. \n\nHonouring invitations is polite. As is asking if you can bring your fairly new girlfriend to someone's house instead of assuming it. No one has to be polite, but it tends to make things go smoother.", "Actually it's super easy to agree to disagree, watch me ignore the rest of the conversation", "NTA. As someone who has been both the girlfriend and the mother of 4, this just seems weird. My husband spent a lot of time with his mother both before and after we married. More visiting his mom than his dad. I spent quite a bit of time with his just his mom and I as well.  As the girlfriend first and then the wife, I never had an issue with this. As a mother I currently have 2 sons-in-law and a future son-in-law. I also have an ex-DIL and ex-son-in-law, I can honestly say that I usually saw their ex-spouse without them, probably because we never really liked either of them and I think the feelings were mutual. I currently have two sons-in-law and a future son-in-law. I often see my daughters without their husbands. I also did while they were dating. I love both of my current sons-in-law, but I rarely see them unless we invite them over for something or they stop by to see if we need help with anything as we are getting older and have had some medical issues. Not that we don't like each other, just that our children are free to live their own lives and I know they are busy. I also see my future son-in-law only sporadically but not because we don't like him. We usually see our daughter when she had a day off mid-week while he is working. The girls will also stop by to see their dad if I am not home, so it isn't just because they are girls, and I am their mother that I see them by themselves. As far as the situation with Alex and Cora, it seems more an issue of control that insecurity on her part.", "NTA.   Sounds like Cora is insecure about her relationship with your son, so may feel a need to keep tabs on him.  That's not good.", "Nta Cora is one of those girls who can't let her bf do something on his own. Too young, no self esteem.\n\n\nEdit spelling", "Cora is an important part of Alex\u2019s life. For now, at least, you will be seeing Cora whenever you see Alex. If you persist at trying to see him away from Cora, you risk alienating him, especially if Cora is his future wife. Once he\u2019s married (whether or not it\u2019s to Cora), his first loyalty transfers to his wife. He\u2019s in love, he wants to be with her, and she wants to be with him. Just be glad you\u2019re in the mix there somewhere. You stir the pot at your own risk, and that includes your other son haranguing his brother on your behalf. \n\nNAH\u2026yet. Just proceed with caution.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA. Going to go on a bit of a tangent here, but I\u2019ve sort of been Alex before where my girlfriend insisted on tagging along to literally anything I did. Personally, I fucking hated it but anytime I tried to set boundaries she would start crying, telling me I\u2019m an asshole, saying that being in a relationship means you always want the other person around etc. I\u2019d cave everytime, and the result was that I became extremely isolated from a lot of my friends and family because my personal relationship with them basically didn\u2019t exist anymore. I started feeling a lot more anxiety because of this, and began to want her around more because she was the only person I truly felt comfortable with. It became incredibly unhealthy and codependent. And then, of course, it ended. And thank god it ended, but there I was with literally nobody left in my life. It took a ton of work to pick up the pieces, reforge the friendships that I could, and become my own person again. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to how your son feels about his situation, but it\u2019s clearly codependent if he\u2019s not willing to have one lunch per month alone with his parent. There is no way in hell a relationship like that lasts with both people being happy. I wish I had advice for you as a parent, but I think all you can do is be there for him when shit inevitably hits the fan. Maybe asking for one on one time will go over better if you also make plans with both of them, that way it\u2019s clear you aren\u2019t trying avoid the gf? If he can\u2019t do that there is something wrong, but you might not be in a place to help", "ESH Tell Alex that they are absolutely a couple but couldn't he give you one lunch a month for just you two? That's all you want is a couple hrs a month for one on one time. Everything else bring Cora and everyone will have a great time.", "NTA I totally understand your feelings but sorry, this happens. It\u2019s pretty common. A lot of the men on my dad\u2019s side did the whole \u201cleave your parents and cleave unto your spouse \u201c thing pretty hard. You just have to wait it out. You can\u2019t antagonize them in case they do get married.", "NAH. When I was dating my ex, when we\u2019d spend time with his family, his parents generally always wanted to spend time with us when we were around. They actually thought I didn\u2019t like time with them. Not everyone has similar relationships with significant others and their families. Cora didn\u2019t do anything wrong but the way this was handled absolutely was.", "Have you talked with your son?  Not as a confrontation but talk with him. I have a child that recently got married, Monday morning while that child is driving to work is our time to talk. We talk about the new marriage, job, working around the house etc. the new spouse isn\u2019t around and it is our time. When relationships are new people get joined at the hip. Some people are joined more than others.", "YTA.  Alex is not a little boy anymore.  You seem to be obsessed with wanting alone time with him.  It is weird and a bit creepy (like you are trying to keep your relationship with him the same as it was when he was a child).  Cora obviously likes you and wants to spend time with her boyfriend's family.  If I were Cora, I would feel like you don't like me.  However, my guess is that it is nothing personal against Cora -- you just don't/wouldn't like anyone in her position (your son's significant other).", "Sounds similar to my own family situation. Since my brother has been with his wife she always has to come with him when he visits my mom or I (sister). Before they were married I thought it was because she was worried we were going to talk him out of marrying her (which we wanted to honestly). Now they have been married for over 2 years and nothing has changed, it's actually worse. I hope your son realizes his girlfriend is too much before it's too late!", "NTA, it's actually not a great sign that they're that opposed to him having any time without her attached to him! Her over the top crying just cements that they NEED to make adjustments so they don't end up wholly codependent!", "I haven\u2019t spoken to my favorite uncle without his wife listening in for 25 years. As far as I know he hasn\u2019t had a private non business conversation with any of our family since they got married. This reminds me of that. NTA", "For real!

You are important to your son so she\u2019s made you a priority. Or maybe her family is a bit more fractured and she likes enjoys spending family time with yours.

If you drive a wedge between them expect him not to bring his next girlfriend around.", "NTA, But if you were hoping to get alone time with your son now, It'll be a long while, very long while. Now Alex will make a point to bring her, to EVERYTHING. either wait it out til their honeymoon period it over, and they cool off on having their hands in eachother'sbackpocket. Or, give Alex some space.\n\nAlex is now hooked on oxytocin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. the love hormones. Just let him hit rock-bottom.", "It\u2019s perfectly normal to want some alone time with your son. Yes, it\u2019s important that you get to know her since she will be around but it\u2019s nice to just be with the original family occasionally. It\u2019s a bit co-dependent to never go anywhere without SO. NTA.", "NTA. It's not that you never want her around it's just occasionally nice to get some individual time with people. \n\nMy parents were in their 50s and still did stuff with their parents individually at times.\n\nI'm in my 30s and have been married for over a decade. I still do things with my mom and things with my dad. Heck my dad and husband go out by themselves too.", "NTA.  It's not like you meet every day.

My feelings would be hurt and conflicted too if I left the room, where I was visiting with my boyfriend\u2019s people who I thought liked me, and come back to them fighting about me being there. Your other son was wrong to bring it up right there. She probably feels comfortable going around you guys because she likes you, and your son probably loves having her there.

My DIL\u2019s mom even comes on vacation with us - the grandkids get all excited to have extra grandparents around and their other grandmother is an adopted grandmother to the other kids in my family we bring with us. We have such a great time together and we do get time to visit separately if they need to talk about something privately while we are on a trip or when they come visit, but I never ask them to come alone. My ex boyfriend, when I was young (together 9 years), had a mom that was completely all inclusive with everyone. We still have a wonderful relationship even after her son and I broke up and he passed away many years ago. She loves my husband and my kids, too and she always welcomes them.", "They\u2019ve only been dating for six months.

Right now? This is expected behavior from a new couple, and you need to mentally adjust your expectations of Alex (And Tommy is younger, so, realistically, you encountered Tommy\u2019s partner at an age when it was realistic that Tommy might not marry that person. Cora and Alex are clearly on the \u201cwe might end up married\u201d track)\n\nEDIT: Alex is old enough that any partner could be his future spouse.

You didn\u2019t give any ultimatums, ban her from holidays/events, or say she can never come around. You asked for a sons\u2019 lunch. Plus by the way she refused to engage with everyone, I feel like the tears were fake and manipulative. Sadly, this is something your son has to figure out on his own. Keep doing your monthly meet ups and adjust for the extra person. Hope for the best and he sorts everything out.", "NTA. OP is def not wrong here.

You aren't an asshole for wanting to have a dinner with just your sons and she idn't an asshole for wanting to be included.

But i really don't think he minds her tagging along so in his mind he is doing nothing wrong, which he ain't. My brother is that way with his new wife when I call it's on speaker, when he comes over she is in front of or beside him. I just recently decided to go NC because he wouldn't even come to our brothers funeral because she couldn't be there I haven't spoken to him since about 8 months ago.

It's perfectly reasonable to have some one-on-one time, especially if you have a close relationship and would always spend time together regularly. Perhaps it was a bad idea to bring it up while Cora was around, because at that time there wasn't much that could be done anyway, but she basically came uninvited. Maybe try to have a calm conversation about it with your son a bit later and explain your point of view, that this is not about disliking or not accepting Cora, you just like to have some private time with him too in addition to that. Might also be good to try and apologise to her personally too for what she heard.

It certainly doesnt make Cora either immature or a manipulative person, just sounds like she's embarrassed.", "I think best case scenario he's in the honeymoon stage of this relationship and has decided she's so amazing that everyone else has to come to realise that too so he'll take her everywhere. \n\nOr he's lacking a spine, she's manipulative and he doesn't have the will or wherewithal to say no to her.\n\nEither way \"we're a package deal\" in a relationship that short shows a sizeable immaturity.", "NTA sounds like a abusive relationship.   \n\nNobody should be this enmeshed.", "That is quite the leap.", "Don't forget that meeting up once a month for a meal with their mother is perfectly acceptable.

By late 20s, people with healthy relationship dynamics understand that people are allowed one on one time with them and it's a normal expectation.

Being sensitive (and struggling with anxiety) doesn't make me or anyone immature.", "You are absolutely right. But having those struggles still doesn't make a person immature. It definetly means that they need to communicate a bit more and that she might need to seek therapy.", "Someone just learned a new word. You should look them up before using them though.

So when we did get together we became attached rather quickly. OP has the right to not like her, hence why I went with N A H in another comment I made.\n\nOne commenter did have a really clever suggestion that OP spends some alone time with Cora. If it were me it would tremendously ease my anxiety. Communication can be difficult, but I hope that they can get past the misunderstanding.

I hope you have a great week!", "Yeah - 90% of the world\u2019s issues, small or big, could be solved if we just communicated and understood each other as equal human beings who all deserve to live happily.\n\nI think Cora and her bf\u2019s mom (OP) need to just get some coffee and talk it out while doing something relaxing, like sewing (love this), listening to music, etc", "Wish you all of the BEST in life :))", "Indeed!

She constantly tags along and immediately goes to crying (a grown ass woman) and to \"why don't you like me???\"which is such a manipulation tactic.
