They owe you a replacement.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not suing the kids, the ones being sued are the adults responsible for them, and if they don't like it, post everything that happenned, including the audio you sent them, and whatever proof you have of them agreeing, as well as the total cost of the ps5, and you stating that you would be willing to let it go if they just reinburse you for the cost.

Multiple failures here on the part of your grandmother. The kids were allowed into the room after you told her it was off limits. They were allowed to play with the PS5 when they were clearly too young. They were obviously not being supervised. Kids that young should be supervised while playing, especially in someone else's home and especially around expensive equipment. And finally, your grandmother is failing to take responsibility for all the rest of her failures and is both blaming the children and trying use them as a shield from legal consequences. You aren't suing them. You're suing her. Anyone with any sense will be able to see that. She invited them over. She is responsible for them. She should be incredibly apologetic to you and offer to replace it right away.", "NTA. Add slander to the case. It sounds like their trash-talking is affecting your livelihood. Include potential lost wages from their actions as damages.   \n\n\nYour grandmother seems like a dick. I'd try to get away from her as fast as possible and not look back.", "Preemptive strike:\n\n Go and post your side of it on every social media possible.

They just wanted the kids to be busy so they'd have free time without them, even if it meant disrespecting your boundaries. Not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't sue them over an accident.  You sued them because they BROKE THE RULES and the damage was the result of them breaking the rules.", "NTA. Collect evidence for slander and continue with the suit.

It's, will this ruin my relationship with grandma, who I need to watch my kid?\n\nYou are morally and legally in the right.
