But, it's not a sport.\n\nI also don't care for it because of the sexualization of cheerleaders and its history of existing solely to cheer on male teams, often exclusively football.

This is everything that is involved with conducting the event, like the planning and logistics. So it's everything under cost of materials, cost of equipment, cost of music/entertainment, and other donations (materials, money, time, etc). \n\nThese would be under the category of \"restricted funds\", which is basically the funds that are needed to host the event. Restricted funds cannot be reappropraited by the organization after they've been collected FOR the event. \n\nThe ONLY people who can decide where these restricted funds go towards are the people who donated those \"funds\". So every person who spent hours planning, every person who contributed financially, every piece of land or furnishing, every donated material, etc. Those people can only decide where THEIR \"funds\" they contributed. \n\nSo the PTA cannot make a vote to change where the \"funds\" go at this point, because it's too close to the deadline. They would have to contact each person who donated to the fundraiser and get permission. Or the PTA would have to reimburse every single dollar that was contributed to the event. \n\nEssentially:  all of the people who volunteered to throw this event for the cheerleaders, and make materials for it, are 100% allowed to ignore the PTA and bail out and not participate with what they made. And if the PTA tries to bully anyone, then they are overreaching.\n\nEdit to add: I thought about this when I was driving home. The funds were collected specifically for cheerleaders, and cannot be changed by voting by the PTA. If the funds were collected under a general reason (ie collected for \"the sports teams at the high school\") then they could change it by a vote. \n\nHowever, since the efforts were conducted by people, for people, and from people who wanted them to go towards the cheerleader team, they are not allowed to be applied somewhere else. It would be like donating to a fundraiser for a soup kitchen, but then the group collecting the funds used it for NRA fundraising event", "Exactly!!!

(Yes, they did end up going on strike)", "This is why they do it though. If there's a \"vote\", it adds an air of legitimacy to the decision, when the \"vote\" never should have happened to begin with.

The high school was actually featured on ESPN for a documentary about their dominance at the state level just about every single year.", "YES. This is what I came here to say. I really think OP should talk to the school, as the PTA may not be allowed to do this.

So we got the the amount of signatures we need from girls interested in playing. What did they do instead. Start a boys team and to this day no girls team.", "Good for you! Agreed! \n\nAlso the football team should have asked to join the fundraiser in a meaningful way. AKA should have figured out complimentary or enhancing things to do for the fundraiser and asked instead of just stealing it bc of a vote.

Our rehearsal room had literal unencapsulated asbestos. So did the weight room. They held a fundraiser to \"build a new weight room and rehearsal room\". Then they shut both rooms down, built a brand new weight room, then put the choir in the old weight room because the asbestos wasn't as bad in there & told us to just not open a certain door in the room.
