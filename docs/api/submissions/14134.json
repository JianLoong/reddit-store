And super dangerious. But cheerleading is not a sport. Sports are won by objective measures. Cheerleading is \"won\" in competition by subjective voting. Just like gymnastics and skating. I am not saying they don't work hard, or aren't supper athletic or incredibly hard-working and self-disciplined. But, it's not a sport.\n\nI also don't care for it because of the sexualization of cheerleaders and its history of existing solely to cheer on male teams, often exclusively football. Male athletes do not have to pass make-up, physical attractiveness, and personality tests. Some of this has changed, but it still has an ick factor to me. I'd rather see girls playing soccer, volleyball, basketball, swimming, softball, or even gymnastics rather than cheerleading.", "Damn that sucks. Of course, small school/town football is king and everything else pales in comparison. You're NTA, not in my book. They pulled a bait and switch on you, and that's on them.", "I agree. OP can do whatever they want with their property. But i stand by my judgment. The footballers have no input on how \"pampered\" they are and justifying screwing them over just for \"fairness\" isn't actually fair. One way helps kids. One doesn't.

OP agreed for a fundraiser with a specific goal, regardless of who was organising it.", "Then there\u2019s no ambiguity, and she would\u2019t be here asking for judgment.\n\nAgain, they are perfectly within their rights to say no, that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t an AH. There\u2019s a reason why even people that voted against the change to the fundraiser are mad.\n\nDid you read their last paragraph? A lot of why they are an AH they already know.
