We had the track coach as the teacher and his naked disdain for our class still chaps my ass to this day. He had a friend of his who needed student teaching hours run our class for 2 months in the run up to the AP test, constantly gave out detentions to people who never normally had them and even volunteered our class to clean the field across from the school after a fire drill because \"it's good for you to work outside\".

There are competitions, etc., that have nothing to with the football/basketball/whatever team. The focus is more on stunts, tumbling, that kind of thing.

Not to mention the fact that they have their own competitions they perform in. So performing at football games is not their only purpose.", "Football games are just practice/performances opportunities for most cheer programs. Their real drive is the cheer competitions. The boys and girls who cheer are athletes at a pretty high level. They don't even do their \"best\"(read: most challenging and technical) stuff at football games.

Our marching band, colorguard (which even competed throughout the year separate from band) and cheerleading team were all nationally ranked while I was in HS. The color guard team even won the National title in two different leagues in the same year.

The only reason I ever went to football games in high school was that I had 4 or 5 friends who played in the marching band and we would hang out as soon as they could leave after half time!", "Lololol... well, if you count on the fact that tumbling uses more muscles in the human body than what a lineman uses lifting weights, then yes. Do I think a cheerleader could bench press a lineman no. But I also don't see many  lineman or any other football position out there throwing and twisting and flipping their bodies end over end in an INTENTIONAL & CONTROLLED manner either... \n And PS hyperbole is fun... ;D", ">Sport.  \n1. an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.\n\nHow is cheerleading not a sport?", "Did you really just imply Gymnastics and Ice Skating aren't sports? WOW.", "There are scoring sheets for cheerleading (and gymnastics). You can get maximum number of points for the skills you plan to do. Then get pre determined deductions for each mistake. A cheerleading team (and gymnast) goes in knowing what their maximum score can be with a perfect routine. It could be 6 max, it could be 9.5 for a gymnast. Cheerleading teams have complicated scorings since there are multiple kids competing at once. It is pretty cut and dry score wise. \n\nIt isn\u2019t the judges sitting there giving a 10 if they like it like in movies. It is essentially a rubric.\n\nETA: there are also tons of controversy about refs not calling things they should in many sports. Soccer/football is RIFE with corruption.", "But your definition doesn\u2019t make sense, since there are so many sports that are won by \u201csubjective\u201d voting. Refs interpret moves on the field and make calls that are often subjective. Martial arts are rated similar to cheerleading in that it\u2019s a combination of subjective calls and the contestant\u2019s execution of specific moves:\n\nCheerleading involves a series of complex moves, each of which are rated on execution and can rack up specific amounts of points. It\u2019s not like watching a musical and rating the quality\u2026 it\u2019s literally looking at the ability and execution.\n\nAs for the sexualization, only weirdos and pervs view it that way, and that\u2019s their problem, not the rest of society\u2019s. Note that we\u2019re talking about academic cheer teams, not the NFL squads (they\u2019re a completely different entity).

No one cares about anything else in this town except the football team.", "I would politely suggest learning a little bit more about cheerleading. Obviously my point of view is clear, and anything I say will come off as biased.

OP should not have to host a massive event \"just because\" and clean up after the randoms who screwed him over.

In his \"about me\" piece on the school website, he wrote all about how much he loved teaching Lit and introducing students to all these wonderful stories.  At the very end he wrote, \"I also coach the varsity football team.\"  That's the right attitude.\n\nWhen I was in school the coaches mostly taught PE, Health, and Driver's Ed.", "At the JR High I went to, coaches basically taught anything that was open. So I had a baseball coach for a math teacher, a basketball coach for a biology teacher, and a football coach for a social studies teacher.

The other two pretty much just passed out worksheets and sat at their desks.", ">those were the most boring, least informative classes I had in high school.\n\nI very much related to this. and I like history! but the social studies curriculum was absolute trash where I grew up. it was always my least favorite class. \n\nactually, I think my AP Gov teacher was fired in the years after I had already graduated high school -- because she was bad at her job.

One group, often in rural or understaffed areas, is terrible because they were assigned to teach math/science when the school district can't find anyone qualified to teach the subject.
