{"id": 2061, "submission_id": "yshb79", "title": "AITA for not letting my sister in law be too involved in my son\u2019s life?", "selftext": "My husband and I have a year old son and he\u2019s the center of our world. Both of our families are very supportive of us and always willing to help! It takes a village to raise a child and we definitely have our village. But, my sister in law over steps her boundaries I feel like. \n\nSo a little backstory on my sister in law who I will call Anna - she can\u2019t have children. She has gotten pregnant but suffered miscarriages but doctors have told her it\u2019s because of her weight. Instead of working on her weight she just stopped going to her doctors. When my husband and I first started dating, we weren\u2019t sure if we wanted to have kids (we were young) and Anna tried talking us into if we had gotten pregnant we would give her and her husband the baby. \n\nIn 2021, husband and I announced our pregnancy at his family\u2019s house and Anna was not happy. When we left the house, Anna told everyone this wasn\u2019t my first pregnancy (I had an ectopic pregnancy in the past & had to medically terminate) and that we \u201cowed\u201d her a baby. That our baby should be hers because we talked about adoption (which my husband and I never agreed to, we awkwardly laughed it off) and she didn\u2019t believe since I had a medical termination I should be able to \u201cpick\u201d when I want to be pregnant (again, it was an ectopic pregnancy). I\u2019m not sure if it was the pregnancy hormones, but Anna genuinely scared me and made me nervous so I distanced myself from her during my pregnancy. \n\nOnce my son was born, Anna and her husband went out and bought a pack & play for my son for when they baby sit, which neither me nor my husband agreed to. She took pictures from social media of my son and sent them to coworkers who I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve set my boundaries with her but she over steps them when we\u2019re at family gatherings. She begged me to pump extra so she could feed my son, took him out of his swing without asking me, and tried holding him and he began screaming and instead of giving him to me or my husband, she argued with us about giving him back. \n\nI send Anna little updates on my son and if she texts me asking how he\u2019s doing I\u2019ll say he\u2019s doing good. I\u2019ve talked to my mother about it and she said I\u2019m just being an overprotective first time mom and I need to let Anna be more involved because infertility is hard to deal with. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit; saw a few comments mentioning how doctors blame everything on weight. This woman gained 300+ pounds in the span of just a few years. She has a plethora of health issues & regularly sees specialists due to her weight. She was also advised her heath conditions would get better if she worked on her weight.\n\nLast edit: thank you everyone for making me feel better about her not wanting to be too involved in my son\u2019s life. My mom instincts are definitely kicking in and I 100% do not want her around my son. I currently have her blocked on social media and will just be giving vague updates if asked. When I delivered my son (2 weeks overdue, don\u2019t wish that on anyone) she made a comment about \u201ctoo bad they put bracelets on them now so you can\u2019t just walk out with them\u201d and I just brushed it off, but now it\u2019s just sitting differently with me. I would like to clarify - I am in no way shaming her body/weight to be vindictive. Her weight & infertility were brought up because they pertain to the situation. Her weight can be managed just by lifestyle changes which she refuses to do when I have offered to go to the gym with her, all of her siblings have, and her husband even offered to get her on a meal plan to help with her food portions. She refuses to seek mental health treatment because she does not believe in it, so it\u2019s hard to help her.", "created_utc": 1668188287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yshb79/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_in_law_be_too/", "score": 725, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is something wrong with SIL. IMO the baby should never be left alone with her.  If that means the baby stays on your lap or in a chair beside you when SIL is present, so be it.   \nThe troubling signs from SIL warrant that.   There are numerous cases of women who want a baby so bad that they will steal one.   Perhaps that is an extreme view to some.  But, SIL is definitely not trustworthy.   What you do is your own business, but here's hoping you never regret the choices you make.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL\u2019s behaviour is screaming red flags!  Trust your mama instincts.

She has overstepped both bounds and propriety in her comments and actions. You do not \"owe\" her anything. She has chosen not to listen to doctors and work on her weight. She clearly wants to take the easy way out and not work on her issues and instead to try and force you to give her a child through adoption, and if that doesn't work by being too involved in your sons life. Watch out for her. I would not let her babysit, and I would be very overly protective around her.\n\nSo sorry to hear of your ectopic pregnancy and the need to terminate. But glad you have recovered and have a healthy son. And there is nothing wrong with picking when you want to be pregnant. She is totally wrong in trying to shame you for an ectopic and a termination. \n\nPersonally, I would distance myself from her, limit her access to my son, and not engage her in conversation. \n\nGood luck!

That's disturbing enough, but even worse are family members who can't see that  her speech and behavior scream of someone who needs serious professional help.

Her anger and discomfort will mean zero if something happens with your child.", "NTA - honestly, you should be more concerned about her. She wants to mother your child. She straight up said to your family that you would give her your child and didn\u2019t deserve a child because you had a medical emergency with your last pregnancy. That is insane rationale. You\u2019re under reacting to this. Imo, she\u2019s not safe to be around. Do her actions and words make you think she\u2019d take your child?

Anna's infertility is not your problem and your son is not a substitute for the children she doesn't have. The parents make the decisions about who is allowed around their child. Your mother can mind her own business.", "NTA. This is not normal, and her belief that you owe her a baby is dangerous. She needs help. I feel bad for her because she clearly has at least one mental disorder, but until she gets help, she's a danger to you and your son.", "NTA - SIL\u2019s fertility have nothing to do with you and you don\u2019t owe her anything! \n\nAs sad as fertility issues can be, the idea that someone would think they are owed a child is preposterous and smacks of narcissism. No one is owed children. \n\nAlso, SIL\u2019s attitude towards your son is absolutely scary and crossing boundaries that should never be crossed. Listen to your instincts, don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. \n\nLastly, I would invite anyone who says you should have more compassion for your SIL, to instead advise her to seek therapy as she clear is mentally unstable and should focus on that rather than fixating on anyone else\u2019s children!", "NTA. I may watch too many Dateline and 20/20 shows but SIL needs help dealing with her weight and the need for a ready made baby.

I would honestly have gone No Contact after the adoption comments and leaking of my kids pictures.  You need to make sure you put up serious boundaries and keep them.

Stay FAR AWAY.", "NTA but you don\u2019t need to bring her weight or medical problems into the story. If she gained 300+ pounds in a few years, something is wrong and likely not something she can fully control. Bring that up makes you seem worse. \n\nSimply put, her behavior is plenty to justify not being closer or wanting her around your baby.

I had thought perhaps he was keeping in touch, like maybe she had other good qualities that might redeem a relationship.

She brought up your ectopic pregnancy in public to try and imply that you were a monster, and say that you needed to be a uterus for her use.\n\nYou guys need to completely cut off contact with her and possibly look around in your area for lawyers to send a cease and desist.

It was disrespectful of her to make you and your partner relive the pain. She seems unable to take care of her own (physical and mental) health, let alone a baby. To put it simply, she seems unstable so you should put your son's safety first and limit the contact with SIL. She overstepped her boundaries so your fears are valid. You should not update SIL about your son too much, it may make her feels more attached to your son.

You could have just said she\u2019s infertile and left it at that because that\u2019s all we needed to know, instead you\u2019re making it about her being fat, then making two edits harping on how fat she is and how it\u2019s her fault, then specifically responding to this comment to talk about how she\u2019s fat?
