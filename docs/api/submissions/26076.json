{"id": 26076, "submission_id": "168bys6", "title": "AITA for putting my niece in the same room as my daughter even though we had a spare?", "selftext": "On a throwaway. \n\nI (22f) and my bf (24m) have 3 kids, aged 3, triplets. When we moved into the house it has 4 bedrooms. we have one, our daughter has one, and the boys share, and then a playroom for their toys. When they\u2019re older one of the boys will move to the playroom but they\u2019re still little, and I\u2019ve read little kids should sleep in a calm, minimal room with toys separate for better sleep, so we\u2019re doing that for now. \n\nMy brother (32m) has a daughter \u201cLucy\u201d (2f). He and his wife married 2 years ago but weren\u2019t able to go on a honeymoon because Lucy was only a month old at the time, so they postponed it and things happened, so they\u2019re going now for their anniversary. They left yesterday for a week and I\u2019m watching Lucy. \n\nThey left in a hurry for their plane, so I took her things and unpacked. I put her in my daughters room. It\u2019s a bit cramped but for a week it\u2019ll do and they don\u2019t spend all day in there anyway. We FaceTimed that night, right before her bedtime. I told them Lucy was sleeping with my daughter, and they didnt say anything to that except they wanted to call after everyone was in bed. \n\nSo we called again, and they asked why Lucy had to share a room when they know the playroom is fine. I told them the playroom was very messy (my fault) and it was so cluttered and bright that Lucy might have trouble going to sleep, and my daughter still had room while the playroom would have to be emptied a bit to fit all her equipment. But they demanded I move her tomorrow, and I should have known their daughter deserved to be by herself since she is at home. So today while everyone was at preschool/playgroup I set up her things in there, but I\u2019m wondering if it really was a super bad thing to do. I didn\u2019t think it would matter, since they never told me she was to be by herself, but again they probably assumed. I don\u2019t know if I did something terrible because they were acting like it was, or if they\u2019re overreacting. They\u2019ve texted every couple hours now to make sure I\u2019m not forgetting things and they\u2019ve never done that before when I watched her in the past, so maybe they don\u2019t trust me anymore? Idk. AITA?

Her parents are just being stuck up and making a big deal out of nothing.", "I'd have told them if they didnt like it, they're welcome to come back and pick her up.", "NTA the kids sharing is fine, they will be great. However your brother and his wife, are big jerks. Don't baby sit for them anymore, they can hire a nanny to nitpick at. Stop responding to them nearly as much. Stick to say 4 times a day and mean it. Definitely don't baby sit for them anymore", "NTA, i would keep her in my daughter's room and then tell them they can take that demand and shove it up their asses and that when they come back dont ever expect me to watch her overnight again if their going to come at me with that attitude when im doing them a favor.", "NTA You have triplets and took on another child so your brother could have a honeymoon. As long as my child was safe (And she clearly is) I'd be so thrilled to get that break I'd never criticise any choice you'd make along the way.", "Nta don't babysit for them again until they get their priorities straightened. As long as her and your daughter are happy and safe then who cares for a week.", "That\u2019s insane \ud83d\ude02 NTA I had to share a room with my two sisters my female cousin and two of my female friends for like 2 weeks. We were having a big sleepover thing because my friends parents were out of town and my cousin was visiting. I had two other male cousins staying to.", "NTA. It makes sense for better sleep for kids to be in a calming environment. Also, some of the best memories of my childhood were sleepovers with my cousin. I definitely would not offer to babysit overnight for such entitled and ungrateful relatives.", "NTA. A 2 year old is more likely to feel uncomfortable in a room by herself than with her 3 year old cousin. \n\nIdk why they would make such a big deal about this, when they didn\u2019t do a good job planning themselves.", "NTA", "NTA! I\u2019d tell them if they don\u2019t like where their daughter is sleeping, they are free to come pick her up, immediately.", "NTA and it\u2019s your home!!", "Tell them you think she would benefit from being at home and you will expect them to come back asap.", "Lmao entitled much? When anyone sleep out they usually sleep with the person they are staying with. In the same room I mean", "NTA but they are and entitled. Whenever I had sleep overs with cousins we'd always sleep in the same bed or someone in a bed and blanket bed on the floor.", "It'd be one thing if your niece was, say, a teenager, and you were trying to get her to be the one in charge of watching your daughter at night*, but this is a 2yo. If anything it's better for her NOT to be completely alone in a new space.\n\nIt's probably for the best not to offer to babysit overnight again, with this reaction, as others have said.\n\n*My cousin tried to pull this with me and her two younger daughters once in a joint family vacation, while they wanted to sleep in a whole other floor from them. The eldest (at the time circa... 8yo, IIRC? Which means I was 15) has night terrors and she wakes up of those screaming bloody murder. Fuck no lol.", "NTA. You are doing them a favor. They don't think you're doing that favor to their standards. I think this post belongs in r/choosingbeggars", "NTA!! As a matter of fact, you're a saint for putting up with that crap. There is absolutely no reason that a 2 year old and a 3 year old can't share a room for a week. What 2 year old \"deserves\" her own room? What does that even mean?   \nWhen they get older I'll bet these 2 girls have many sleepovers. Isn't the whole point of sleepovers for kids to share a room?  \nYour brother and his wife are irrational and unreasonable. Remind them that you are doing them a favor and tell them to stop calling you. Give them a definite time to call you (once a day) and don't answer the phone or any messages except at that time.  \nYou taken care of triplets for 3 years, I have to think you've got a good handle on what you're doing.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t know what the issue is with them but there\u2019s no reason for her to be alone. She\u2019d probably be more comfortable in a room\nWith your daughter since she\u2019s not home. If they\u2019re that paranoid about how you watch their kid then maybe next time tell them you don\u2019t want to watch her.", "NTA. They're fine sharing a room. What is it with people being crappy to free or cheap childcare on reddit? The kids are better served with a playroom.", "Absolutely NTA \n\nThey\u2019re being ridiculous and I would not ever agree to babysit them again after this. They are showing you that they don\u2019t trust you. Maybe they need to come home then and take care of their kid themselves if they are going to be that particular", "My daughter would have been thrilled to have a sleep over with her cousins.", "I don\u2019t think they fully understand/respect how busy you are with a houseful of your own kids, let alone to take theirs for a week! I can\u2019t even imagine wanting my 2 yr old to sleep alone at my sisters place. I think it would be much more comforting for her to have her cousins around, especially if she wakes up in the middle of the night in a room that\u2019s not hers and gets a bit disoriented. Her cousins are like a safety blanket. But either way, the way your brother and sister in law treated you is not at all acceptable! They need to learn manners and you need to learn about setting boundaries.", "NTA. They sound deranged. She's TWO, ffs. If I were you I'd refuse to watch her again.", "Choosy beggars.  A two year old doesn\u2019t need their own bedroom and doesn\u2019t care where they sleep.  Why the parents care is a mystery.  NTA.  Don\u2019t babysit for them again.", "Nta and I would assume she would be scared to be alone. Ask her what she wants to do", "Your brother demanded?  Tell him he can pick up his daughter.", "Right! It\u2019s a cousin sleepover it\u2019s fun! Plus do they really think a 2 year old will sleep well surrounded by toys?", "I totally agree!", "I'd refuse to move her out of the daughter's room and tell the parents what i told all my niece's and nephew's parents when they were left with me: if you don't like how i take care of your kid, then come get them!", "Wouldn\u2019t volunteer to sit overnight again. They only concerns should include safety, security and kindness. Too much food, sweets, sharing a room\u2026 won\u2019t damage a child in a week. Parents have the wrong priorities.", "She's two years old sharing a room with a 3 year old girl and this is a temporary thing.\n\nNTA. This is rally controlling.", "And probably more comforting than being alone in a strange room with different shadows and sounds.", "r/ChoosingBeggars", "This, I'm so mad OP caved and put up with this ridiculous demand.  I would never babysit for them again.  I would've told them if they don't like how I'm babysitting they can come back and get their kid, or have someone else pick them up, or stfu about it.\n\nThis is absurd, the kids already away from her parents and they want to isolate her more. They're getting free childcare and want to make it as difficult as possible for the person doing them a huge favor, OP had to clean up the spare room, and now instead of being able to check on 2 kids at once she has to go from room to room. Seriously OP grow a spine! \n\nNTA for the same room thing, but y.  t.    a.  to yourself for giving in.", "She has her playpen (her travel bed), quite a few toys, foldable changing table, and I also moved a lamp in for her as a night light. I only took out their kitchen set and one bookshelf to make room though, it wasn\u2019t too much :)", "Well yes, when we decided one room would become the playroom, we grouped the boys together because they\u2019re boys, and the room is larger than my daughter\u2019s. They actually love sharing so far. But as I said, in a couple years they\u2019ll all have their own rooms :)", "The equipment is just her bed and things, no medical :)", "Especially unfamiliar toys", "Cousin sleepovers are the best! We didn\u2019t just share a room, we all slept in the same bed.", "Yeah, what a crazy thing to be upset/worried about. What's next, kid will only sleep on a mattress of clouds  with a string quartet lulling her to sleep? I'm guessing they didn't send the kid with a crib or a toddler bed, they should be grateful for anything they get.", "I cannot *imagine the luxury* of having a trusted family member care for a toddler for a week! My husband and I had no nearby family members. We didn\u2019t go away for that long until the oldest of our three boys was ten, and we had a trusted part-time sitter willing to take the job.\n\nNTA, OP! These people are entitled and crazy.", "Oooh thanks! Going to binge read that space now.", "She is taking care of 5 toddlers.  It may have been mentally easier just to move her than deal with the entitled parents?", "OP, you seem like a very nice person, but if you ever watch your niece again, I think it\u2019s reasonable to set an expectation that she\u2019ll be sharing your daughter\u2019s room.  Because once your kids are older, you said either way that there won\u2019t be a spare room anymore with the playroom converted to another bedroom.", "Foldable changing table? She's 2 years not 2 months! What the hell does she need a foldable changing table for?", "We slept on the floor in a pile of blankets and pillows it was great. We looked forward to it.", "They do go a bit overboard I admit, but she has just turned 2 a month ago so not toilet trained yet, I don\u2019t use it for her but they bring it everywhere \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
