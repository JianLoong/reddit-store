Or  say that something has \"come up\" last minute and you regretfully must miss the party.  Thank them for the invite and wish them a happy early birthday.\n\nNo harm, no foul.", "Maybe they just forgot, it happens. Unless there is some reason to think you are purposefully being snubbed, I would let it go. But if you really aren't going to feel comfortable at the party, don't go. NAH", "You're never obligated to attend a birthday party for another adult.\n\nNTA", "I forgot to invite my brother to my bday party. His my best friend. Brain fade.", "NTA\n\nBut I mean you're an adult, if you don't wanna go it's not a nig deal and if you do I'm sure ko one will even notice you weren't on the original list.", "NAH. \n\nTeams sucks. It's really hard to see who is actually in the group chat. My guess is that they thought you and the others were in there, then realized you weren't. I wouldn't read too much into it. \n\nGo or don't. It's just a work get-together. Don't take it personally. If they really didn't want you there, you wouldn't be invited at all.", "It doesn't need to go deeper than go if you want to go, don't if you don't. \n\nBut feeling slighted because your invitation was later than others is a little much.\n\nNAH", "NAH, You don't have to go if you don't want to.\n\nBut is not suspicious that you were invited after other people, specially since the party is weeks out. Is not like they gave you a 2 hour notice.\n\nAs the person who is usually in charge of planning, I usually invite people in stages and is not because i like some people more than others. I have learned that is easier to get the plan rolling once i get a couple of people to agree to go individually and we have the location and a time, after that i add everyone else.\n\nI find that when I make a group with everyone the plans never workout, because large groups are terrible at decision making and everyone wants to put their two cents without actually doing the work.\n\nI would say you sound a bit self centered, you mention that you guys are barely acquaintance but think the \"late\" invite is some plot against you.", "NTA\n\nGo if you want to go.  Don't go if you don't want to.\n\nHowever, if you work with these people, be sure you don't come off as petty.  I personally might make an appearance just to check the box.  Maybe they just forgot you and someone said \"what about Timmy?\"  \n\nThe one thing you don't want to do is make a big deal about being a late invite or tell someone that's why you're not going.", "NTA you are under no obligation to go but\u2026it might be a fun social opportunity with others if you can get past the B-list invite.", "I don't get why you are suspicious? What would the ulterior motive be?   \n\n\nI have ADHS and am super forgetful. There were plenty of times I have added people late to a group chat instead of in one go.  \nNTA though, you don't need to go if you don't want. I would just thank them for the invite and congratulate them on their birthday. If I don't forget.", "NTA, you don\u2019t have to go to anything if you don\u2019t want to; you certainly don\u2019t need a reason", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nGo or don't go, as you wish.\n\nBut if you don't, perhaps it would be better not to tell the hosts (or anyone) how you feel about how you were late-included.\n\nBe sure to RSVP, and if you turn it down, be nice, just in case it was an accident. Say you have an engagement, but happy birthday.", "NTA- for not going.\n\nOr something like this prepare a statement like oh, \"Oh! I'm sorry.  I just got the invite x date, and  I have plans.  If only I had known sooner.\n\n*- family because family cancels last minute all the time.  So if you get called on it then family cancelled.\n\nBut yeah, likely a work resource shouldn't be used to plan personal birthday parties.  Especially if not everyone is invited.  That is likely why you got an invite.  If someone asked well, is everyone invited? You used to work resource.  Then they invited everybody.\n\nA talk with HR might be involved but you might just give it some time.  Maybe talk to HR when this is more in the rear view.  To avoid middle school stuff like this.", "NTA", "NTA. But I would just politely decline and say you have other plans. Thank them for the invite and wish them a happy birthday. I\u2019m not excusing what they did, but bringing it up will inevitably cause office tension. Do what you feel is right. Just keep that in mind."]}
