For context as it\u2019s relevant to the situation, I (30F) am a white woman, while my husband and his family are 1st/2nd gen east and southeast Asian. \n\nWhen we originally made plans, we agreed on a local higher-end chain spot that we had been to many times in the past. However, the day before, my MIL sent us a message that her brother had switched spots to another high end Chinese restaurant. I\u2019d never been there,  but I didn\u2019t really care and was happy to go. We regularly eat and sometimes make home-cooked traditional Chinese food anyways, so there was no issue.\n\nSo we pack up our son (1M) and meet his family at this new restaurant. It was mostly nice but one thing struck me immediately. The restaurant HEAVILY advertised and displayed its shark fin soup menu. To the point that there were some fins literally hanging on display. \n\nIn our country, the sale of shark fins is illegal. It\u2019s also known to be extremely cruel (basically, the fin is removed from living sharks and the animal is left to slowly die unable to swim), and ecologically a key reason for some at-risk shark species population declines. \n\nEveryone sat down, and I was notably quiet. I quickly pulled my husband to the side to explain that I was really uncomfortable with this restaurant as it sold shark fin and try to figure out what to do. I was really anxious given the illegality of the dish and morally upset. He said we could talk about it when we got home but to please just get through the dinner.\n\nWhen it came time to order, a lot of the aunts and uncles ordered shark fin soup, while everyone else ordered fancy dishes. Internally I was still freaking out, and quickly just chose the plainest possible noodle dish (basically noodles with oil) and said I would share it with my son. I got some weird looks from my MIL and BIL since they know I regularly love Chinese food and this wouldn\u2019t be my typical order. \n\nThe food arrives and I cut up/give some of the noodles to my son (he still needs to eat) and really just pick at the rest while we\u2019re there. There is a lot of food sharing but I wouldn\u2019t participate and also blocked my son from participating. Some family made comments on my & my son\u2019s not sharing but I just laughed them off or changed the subject. There wasn\u2019t any conflict while we were at the restaurant and I tried to hide my discomfort and hold happier conversations with everyone there. \n\nWhen we got home my husband asked if I was feeling well and why I hadn\u2019t eaten more food. I told him I was uncomfortable eating shark fin and didn\u2019t want to eat at a restaurant that supported eating shark fin, and didn\u2019t want our son eating there either. He got angry and said I was embarrassing him, and I guess called a couple family members. Now I have a bunch of them messaging me saying I am racist and I am \u201cstealing my son\u2019s culture from him\u201d. \n\nAITA for not sucking it up and eating at the restaurant?", "created_utc": 1671360188, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zovut1/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_at_my_husbands_family/", "score": 1777, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I lived in China for 9 years and food culture has a whole different aspect that I am 100000% sure you haven't seen all of, even though you married into the family.  Yes, food sharing is part of the culture.  It is seen as a politeness and a way of showing that there is room for all and that all are important. It comes from a history of there being times of lack and the focus on everybody being equals and important.  It comes from a place of respect.

You had a private conversation with your husband about it, then you ate lightly, and went home. Your husband thought you were feeling ill, and likely others at the table thought the same thing, so it was only by HIM calling people to tell them why you didn't eat that this became a problem for anyone else there. \n\nIgnore the messages from his family, and tell your husband due to HIS actions his family is calling you racist, and he can deal with that because now you aren't going to be around people that would call you racist. That is fully on him to deal with, and honestly, I wouldn't be around anyone who would text/tell me that. \n\nAnd it isn't racist to uncomfortable with animal cruelty. Sure, most of us- of all cultures across the globe- participate in practices/food that are cruel to animals and do a host of other practices that are bad for the environment or society. But, we are all allowed to decide how to navigate that, and I think a fair one is not participating in actions deemed so bad they are illegal like shark fin soup or items made out of ivory. \n\nThat's a very reasonable boundary, to not want to eat illegal food and support a business that does, and again, you were very polite and nonconfrontational in your discomfort.

Seems like you tried to duck it up but definitely added tension to the situation that got read as hostility. I also have married into an Asian family. Once, when my mil encouraged my sil (both vietnamese) to have shark fin soup, my sil stated directly, \"no, it's cruel and endangers the environment. I'm getting something else.' that's actually what prompted me to look up the issue. Win/win. Also, fyi, most \"shark fin\" soup is substitution.", "nta, but your husband is for basically calling you out afterwards and telling his relatives.", "NTA. Shame on your husband for getting his family to harass you!", "They may be saying that the soup is  shark fin when it is not.  Restaurants substitute pork for veal and do other shady stuff.

For the Op and the spouse.\n\nI understand the discomfort of not wanting to support and eat the food at the restaurant that sells shark fin soup. The situation honestly could've been better handled to void the conflict of your personal moral and the culture the other family members are practicing.\n\nI'm Chinese and I don't support the sale, brutally harvesting of shark fin for consumption. But I also grew up eating it and not knowing anything about the brutality. And truthfully, the older generation don't know or see or want to hear about it. If I learn anything through therapy, is that you can't change others. You could advocate, you could educate, you can debate, but you can't change others.\n\nDoing it at the family gathering might not be the best way to raise the topic. There's the right time to do the right thing. \n\nIf you didn't want to eat shark fin or any food from the resto, make up an excuse and step away from the dinner table and go home. Call an uber, grab a taxi, drive yourself home, ask for a private area in the restaurant. Any excuse to step away is better than sit there awkwardly and demonstrate obvious dismay of the shark fin consumption by restricting what your kid wants to eat and ordering something you clearly won't order normally. \n\nAnd clearly your spouse is an AH for calling around.

I probably would have left and reported the restaurant  to the necessary authorities.", "Nta and good job to you for sticking to your views .

If it was the USA then you have all right to refuse service.\n\nBut NTA as due to the global pandemic going on, hello the last thing that locked the country down sharing food is not a good idea at all.  And to put your child at risk is not a good idea.\n\nThis is not about you being racist or stealing your son's culture from him, this is about the fact that you are protecting your son from a potential fatal disease at his young age and at the same time realizing that such foods, like shark fin is outlawed in some countries.  Even in the US, where it was outlawed and even the court cases challenging it was dismissed by the court.", "NTA I think you handled it way better than I would have. Seriously we're in 2022, with all the information available, people should know better. I would report the restaurant.", "NTA. You don't want you or your son to be included in eating illegal dishes. There's nothing wrong with that. \n\nShark fin soup is created by such a horrible practice. It would be \"better\" if they used every part of the shark (like some folks when they hunt dear, etc) but they don't. It's horrible.

And why in the name of all that's holy is he telling your family? It's not really their business.  \nAnd there's a lot more to Asian culture than eating shark fins.  \nHaving a moral objection to something isn't a big deal, and not eating something because of that moral objection also isn't a big deal. That doesn't make you racist.", "NTA honestly I would have left the restaurant and am a bit disappointed in you. You knew better but didn't do better.", "NTA I would\u2019ve walked out and I would 100% report the restaurant. We are decimating the shark populations. There are estimates that 90% of some species are now gone. Shark fin soup should be banned. It\u2019s barbaric and disgusting what we are doing to sharks around the world.", "NTA\n\nMany cultures participated in slavery and human sacrifice. Heck the ancient Hawaiians pretty much made a bird go extinct just so they could use their few yellow feathers for decorating their clothing.\n\nCultural traditions aren't always good.

It doesn\u2019t justify the cruelty of it.  NTA", "NAH, Depends on a few things. Were there other shark dishes on the menu? In Canada it\u2019s legal as long as they buy the entire shark. \n\nMy in laws are Chinese and tried to make us get it on our wedding menu and we finally just lied and say we did but went with imitation shark fin soup instead. \n\nI personally think even if the whole shark is used it\u2019s still pretty icky and and wouldn\u2019t consume the real thing myself. But if the restaurant has a license and does sell the rest of the shark it is legal (at least in Canada)", "NTA AT ALL! Good for you, sounds like you handled it like a pro. Shark Fin is cruel and disturbing,  thats why it is illegal and frowned upon so heavily. I think it was unnecessary for your husband to call and gossip about your opinion on the issue, knowing how his family would react. Good luck with everything OP.", "NTA\n\nYou normally eat with them and enjoy it. They chose a place whose luxury is based on its illegality. You did the best with the situation at hand. They know you enjoy them, their culture, and food. They just felt judged for doing something bad. I eat meat, and don\u2019t huge people for what they eat. But if I found out the meat source was gained, processed or distributed cruelly, OR ILLEGALLY!!!, I wouldn\u2019t participate.", "No vote. I feel like this is a weird hill to die on. Consuming animal protein at pretty much any restaurant or from a commercial supermarket is supporting animal cruelty to a greater or lesser degree. Industrial livestock trading is monstrous, full stop. So unless you're only sourcing your meat directly from a farm and only eating at certified farm-to-table restaurants, I don't think you've got the steadiest moral ground to stand on here.", "Look: everyone's making a big deal over the shark's fin and how illegal it is, which is fair, but what actually is upsetting your husband and his family is that you attended a celebratory family banquet and refused to partake of any of the dishes at all, not just the shark's fin, and also blocked your son from eating anything besides the very plainest noodles that you ordered separately. That looks really rude to Malaysian/Singaporean Chinese, like you're too picky to share food with them and trying to teach your child to be picky.\n\nNot saying that's what you're doing, that's what it's going to look like to someone of a similar cultural background to your husband.\n\nThe thing to do would've been to raise your objection to the shark's fin alone, and eat the other things, not passive-aggressively order a separate serving of noodles, and nothing but noodles with oil at that.\n\nAlso I'm not sure your husband actually called his relatives on you. Chinese uncles and aunties will 100% do that shit on their own.", "NTA - they were the assholes for patronizing this person place and even ordering this.", "NTA.  It seems like you were respectful about it and didn't make a scene.  Plus, just because something is \"cultural\" doesn't mean it needs to continue.  We have a lot of things that used to be considered cultural and as society evolved we discovered those things were wrong or cruel.  Change is good!", "Nta. Good for you on staying true to your ethics in an uncomfortable situation. You made an effort at dinner. You have nothing to feel bad about.", "NTA. There are Chinese people who also won't eat shark fin and don't support the practice, it isn't mandatory to do those things in order to be non-racist.\n\nI think you handled it very classily given you were so uncomfortable.", "NTA why dont you report the restaurant?", "YTA, babe. As someone who is also married into an Asian family, you already know what the vibes are. They are very serious about their food and they want everyone to have a good experience. Shark fin is clearly apart of their culture and you turning up your nose to them for eating it is messed up. It\u2019s like a vegan going out to dinner with friends and being weird about those friends eating meat. If it\u2019s not your preference, don\u2019t eat it.

OP isn't even the one who made a fuss, at the table or after. Her husband caused the main conflict  by running to his entire family to badmouth her.

Why should husband\u2019s family\u2019s feelings matter when OP\u2019s feelings don\u2019t. You were never given an opportunity to vet this place before agreeing as the change was last minute.", "Agreed. Your husband should\u2019ve had your back he didn\u2019t need to share with his family. That\u2019s not fair.", "Sorry, but being weirdly quiet and ordering almost nothing to eat counts as making a fuss. Passive-aggressive fuss, but fuss nonetheless.", "exactly this. being part of / supportive of a culture doesn't mean accepting everything that they do without question.

I had to look up what foie gras is, I wasn\u2019t against it before but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had it. I\u2019ll avoid it now (& thanks for highlighting it!). For other meats, I try but I am far from perfect. I\u2019m not vegetarian or vegan but I try to make it so at least half of my family\u2019s meals are plant-based, and we try to buy free-range (I know that\u2019s also not amazing but it\u2019s what we have in our stores). \n\nSo I guess to answer is I try to avoid ethically questionable foods overall, but I\u2019m definitely don\u2019t always get it right.", "SHE DID simply not order and not eat the soup. It says so right there in the post. She and her son ate noodles and she changed the subject/laughed it off when people commented.", "Wth? OP did simply order something else. She did sit through the dinner with vague politeness and made an effort to maintain pleasantries. She quietly stuck to her morals and did not use the dinner to make a statement or scene. It was not until OP confided her husband in the privacy of her own home that the in-laws found out because for some god-forsaken reason her husband called up his parents and told them like some insufferable whiney school boy. \n\nAnd illegal or not, the practice of harvesting only the fins of sharks exist because surprise, surprise, it affects profit margins and humans love money often at the cost of morals. I saw a documentary of the practice and let me tell you... I am no fan of sharks I think they look frightening and would high tail it out of there if ever I met one. But when I saw this apex predator of the sea caught by people, sliced of all its fins, then tossed back into the ocean like trash unable to swim, eyes still roving mouth still gaping falling towards the bottom of the ocean.. and they repeated this horrific dismembering and tossing again and again... I was INCENSED. No living thing should be treated this way! There is no way to police that the boats arent doing this to try to maximize profits because the fins are where the real money is at. OP had every right to just walk out of that restaurant but she didn't and uncomfortably but politely sat through. OP deserves an apology for the bogus racism accusations (c'mon now racism exists and this is not it) and a big one from her husband. OP did nothing wrong.", "So just because OP is at a family dinner it's time to abandon her morals to make others more comfortable? I would have left the restaurant with the kid. It sounds like OP married into the wrong family.", "Kinda feel like it's not rude to to stand up for your beliefs. It shows integrity. OP did not speak rudely to anyone in attendance. My ex-husband is Muslim, I am not. Muslim people do not eat pork. Was one of us supposed to give up our beliefs to satisfy the other? Should I have insisted he join me in chowing on bacon? Should he have expected me to partake in prayer for a belief I don't share?", "We\u2019re in Canada. Honestly it didn\u2019t even cross my mind on the food being potentially dangerous, and I want to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt that they are at least using safe food. I was more concerned ethically.", "You\u2019re wrong about OP being a bit of an AH. She didn\u2019t boycott the restaurant or expect anyone to leave or leave herself. All she did was eat simply and not share food. She could have had an upset stomach and ordered a small dish; she might not want to share because we\u2019re still living in a global panini. She\u2019s definitely not an AH in the least.", "Lmao. I read so many better informed responses to your rude arrogant one. Sounds like you need to educate yourself instead in this matter instead of OP.", "This had to be in Vancouver and there are many things that got through there just because one part of it was partially legal. Before cannabis was legal there were dispensaries all over Vancouver that you could go and buy weed. It was super illegal at the time and grey area for those with green cards. They still couldn't buy from those dispensaries legally.", "I wondered about this myself.  I can \ud83d\udcaf support not eating the shark fin soup!  I'm not clear on how passing up, say, sesame cucumber salad or ma po tofu or any other shared dishes is a principled stance against illegal shark harvesting.  Eating plain noodles and only allowing the son to eat same seems a little performative and passive-aggressive to me.  I'd have been more in favor of saying \"I am uncomfortable with eating shark fin, I'm going to pass on this dish.\"", "That was my understanding, that the broth would be nice if you swapped the fin for chicken or something. Its eaten because its 'traditional!!!' And maybe as a slight status symbol.", "And it's entirely possible to make soup that tastes exactly the same without shark fins!!", "I know it\u2019s illegal now but the soup was actually tasty. You just got bad soup.", "Very true and something I\u2019ve come to understand, so I\u2019m not super surprised my husband\u2019s immediate reaction was to call his relatives, and although I don\u2019t like it I do sort of \u201cget it\u201d.  For example, when I just started breastfeeding our son I got thrush, basically the equivalent of a yeast infection. I was super embarrassed and didn\u2019t tell anyone - but he immediately went to his mom and aunts for advice.  In his mind he was helping me by getting the family\u2019s input and support. I found out when his mom asked me how I was doing. We laughed it off, but the sharing (and in western views, oversharing) with family is definitely a cultural difference thing!", "Most large cities in canada have Buddhist vegetarian/vegan restaurants that serve veggie versions of traditional Chinese/asian foods- It's not a common thing to see, but I've seen \"shark fin\" soup on the menu at a couple of them, though I have only seen it at more off the beaten path places that don't cater as much to westerners.\n\nThere's plenty of people who practice and respect their cultures while not consuming animals at all!", "I haven't seen this mentioned in any comments yet, but I believe you're familiar with the fact that most Chinese restaurants (especially the high-end ones) are family-style dining.  Soups are usually served in a huge bowl with a ladle and a stack of small bowls.  If multiple people were ordering individual bowls of the same (expensive, illicit, exclusive) soup, they weren't for sharing.  The only time my family shares individual-serving soup dishes is if they've coordinated orders for different varieties in extra-large bowls.\n\nAdditionally, shark fin is traditionally a special occasion soup.  My family only ordered it for once-a-decade family reunions in HK, back before it was outlawed.  I agree with your stance on shark fin and I personally would not seek it out again for the same reasons as you.\n\nLastly, Asian families do not split the bill, it's considered extremely rude all around.  It's almost a highlight of the meal when everyone starts jockeying for position to pay, with uncles gesticulating emphatically with each other while the aunties are trying to discreetly slip a waiter their card before anyone else notices.  The gesture of offering/competing to pay is usually enough to satisfy for etiquette's sake.  Because it was a high-end (and therefore expensive) restaurant, unless your husband had something to prove, I would wager he was knocked out of contention early.\n\nSo to recap, you were a guest at a special occasion dinner at a high-end restaurant with extended family.  Given that your son is so young, your in-laws were probably very excited to share delicacies (not just shark fin) and dishes that would be hard to find outside of this particular milieu.\n\nThis experience would have been especially significant given how food-oriented Asian cultures (not just Chinese) tend to be.  The youngest child gets the choicest morsels.  Sure, he's only a year old, so he's not going to remember what lobster noodles taste like.  But your in-laws would have cherished the memory of his first bite, and recounted it for years to come.  My own family (myself included), has fond memories of my younger sister's meditative trance as she sampled steamed tilapia for the first time.\n\nIt's fine that you ordered plain noodles, but combined with your withdrawn behaviour, your in-laws probably thought that you were feeling poorly and were worried for you and your son's health.  They likely inquired about you both afterwards out of concern.\n\nTL;DR You're not the asshole for declining the shark fin, but you've needlessly alienated your in-laws because you were so focused on your moral stance.  Again, I completely agree that shark fin harvesting is cruel and ecologically destructive.  Your in-laws may feel defensive over their choice of appetizer, but more importantly, they feel that you blocked your son from a significant experience (outside of the shark fin) and robbed your in-laws of a chance to bond.  There's no telling when (or if) that opportunity may arise again.\n\nI myself am Chinese and have had multiple interracial partners, so I've had to explain these etiquette rules more than once.  I can't speculate on why your husband did not sufficiently cover for you, both at the restaurant and after the fact.", "agree that these things are culture - shark-fin soup, fois gras, sexualization of children, etc - but culture is not sacrosanct. harmful things are harmful regardless of who does them. \n\nand this isn't a fairly minor thing, like the normalization of high heels (harmful, but basically voluntary, and mostly for adults); this is widespread hunting of threatened or endangered keystone species for a delicacy.", "I think that\u2019s fair.

Shark fining is a horrific practice that should be banned everywhere. Shark fishing should be highly limited and even catch and release is questionable as the stress from being caught can often lead to the shark dying later anyway, especially if the shark is removed from the water, particularly with larger shark species.", "That really got to me too.

It should have been a private conversation but instead he used it to get his family's help in putting his wife \"back in her place.\" OP is NTA.", "I'm sorry - this is off topic and I know you meant pandemic, but global panini made me laugh so hard.", "Oh I wish I had an award for this comment", "She is educated enough to know that shark fins are illegal to harvest in most places because of the cruelty involved.
