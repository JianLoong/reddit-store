For context as it\u2019s relevant to the situation, I (30F) am a white woman, while my husband and his family are 1st/2nd gen east and southeast Asian. \n\nWhen we originally made plans, we agreed on a local higher-end chain spot that we had been to many times in the past. However, the day before, my MIL sent us a message that her brother had switched spots to another high end Chinese restaurant. I\u2019d never been there,  but I didn\u2019t really care and was happy to go. We regularly eat and sometimes make home-cooked traditional Chinese food anyways, so there was no issue.\n\nSo we pack up our son (1M) and meet his family at this new restaurant. It was mostly nice but one thing struck me immediately. The restaurant HEAVILY advertised and displayed its shark fin soup menu. To the point that there were some fins literally hanging on display. \n\nIn our country, the sale of shark fins is illegal. It\u2019s also known to be extremely cruel (basically, the fin is removed from living sharks and the animal is left to slowly die unable to swim), and ecologically a key reason for some at-risk shark species population declines. \n\nEveryone sat down, and I was notably quiet. I quickly pulled my husband to the side to explain that I was really uncomfortable with this restaurant as it sold shark fin and try to figure out what to do. I was really anxious given the illegality of the dish and morally upset. He said we could talk about it when we got home but to please just get through the dinner.\n\nWhen it came time to order, a lot of the aunts and uncles ordered shark fin soup, while everyone else ordered fancy dishes. Internally I was still freaking out, and quickly just chose the plainest possible noodle dish (basically noodles with oil) and said I would share it with my son. I got some weird looks from my MIL and BIL since they know I regularly love Chinese food and this wouldn\u2019t be my typical order. \n\nThe food arrives and I cut up/give some of the noodles to my son (he still needs to eat) and really just pick at the rest while we\u2019re there. There is a lot of food sharing but I wouldn\u2019t participate and also blocked my son from participating. Some family made comments on my & my son\u2019s not sharing but I just laughed them off or changed the subject. There wasn\u2019t any conflict while we were at the restaurant and I tried to hide my discomfort and hold happier conversations with everyone there. \n\nWhen we got home my husband asked if I was feeling well and why I hadn\u2019t eaten more food. I told him I was uncomfortable eating shark fin and didn\u2019t want to eat at a restaurant that supported eating shark fin, and didn\u2019t want our son eating there either. He got angry and said I was embarrassing him, and I guess called a couple family members. Now I have a bunch of them messaging me saying I am racist and I am \u201cstealing my son\u2019s culture from him\u201d. \n\nAITA for not sucking it up and eating at the restaurant?", "created_utc": 1671360188, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zovut1/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_at_my_husbands_family/", "score": 4676, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I lived in China for 9 years and food culture has a whole different aspect that I am 100000% sure you haven't seen all of, even though you married into the family.  Yes, food sharing is part of the culture.  It is seen as a politeness and a way of showing that there is room for all and that all are important. It comes from a history of there being times of lack and the focus on everybody being equals and important.  It comes from a place of respect.

You had a private conversation with your husband about it, then you ate lightly, and went home. Your husband thought you were feeling ill, and likely others at the table thought the same thing, so it was only by HIM calling people to tell them why you didn't eat that this became a problem for anyone else there. \n\nIgnore the messages from his family, and tell your husband due to HIS actions his family is calling you racist, and he can deal with that because now you aren't going to be around people that would call you racist. That is fully on him to deal with, and honestly, I wouldn't be around anyone who would text/tell me that. \n\nAnd it isn't racist to uncomfortable with animal cruelty. Sure, most of us- of all cultures across the globe- participate in practices/food that are cruel to animals and do a host of other practices that are bad for the environment or society. But, we are all allowed to decide how to navigate that, and I think a fair one is not participating in actions deemed so bad they are illegal like shark fin soup or items made out of ivory. \n\nThat's a very reasonable boundary, to not want to eat illegal food and support a business that does, and again, you were very polite and nonconfrontational in your discomfort.

I saw a documentary of the practice and let me tell you... I am no fan of sharks I think they look frightening and would high tail it out of there if ever I met one. But when I saw this apex predator of the sea caught by people, sliced of all its fins, then tossed back into the ocean like trash unable to swim, eyes still roving mouth still gaping falling towards the bottom of the ocean.. and they repeated this horrific dismembering and tossing again and again... I was INCENSED. No living thing should be treated this way! There is no way to police that the boats arent doing this to try to maximize profits because the fins are where the real money is at.

They still couldn't buy from those dispensaries legally.", "I wondered about this myself.  I can \ud83d\udcaf support not eating the shark fin soup!  I'm not clear on how passing up, say, sesame cucumber salad or ma po tofu or any other shared dishes is a principled stance against illegal shark harvesting.  Eating plain noodles and only allowing the son to eat same seems a little performative and passive-aggressive to me.  I'd have been more in favor of saying \"I am uncomfortable with eating shark fin, I'm going to pass on this dish.\"", "That was my understanding, that the broth would be nice if you swapped the fin for chicken or something. Its eaten because its 'traditional!!!'

For example, when I just started breastfeeding our son I got thrush, basically the equivalent of a yeast infection. I was super embarrassed and didn\u2019t tell anyone - but he immediately went to his mom and aunts for advice.  In his mind he was helping me by getting the family\u2019s input and support. I found out when his mom asked me how I was doing. We laughed it off, but the sharing (and in western views, oversharing) with family is definitely a cultural difference thing!", "Most large cities in canada have Buddhist vegetarian/vegan restaurants that serve veggie versions of traditional Chinese/asian foods- It's not a common thing to see, but I've seen \"shark fin\" soup on the menu at a couple of them, though I have only seen it at more off the beaten path places that don't cater as much to westerners.\n\nThere's plenty of people who practice and respect their cultures while not consuming animals at all!", "I haven't seen this mentioned in any comments yet, but I believe you're familiar with the fact that most Chinese restaurants (especially the high-end ones) are family-style dining.  Soups are usually served in a huge bowl with a ladle and a stack of small bowls.  If multiple people were ordering individual bowls of the same (expensive, illicit, exclusive) soup, they weren't for sharing.  The only time my family shares individual-serving soup dishes is if they've coordinated orders for different varieties in extra-large bowls.\n\nAdditionally, shark fin is traditionally a special occasion soup.  My family only ordered it for once-a-decade family reunions in HK, back before it was outlawed.  I agree with your stance on shark fin and I personally would not seek it out again for the same reasons as you.\n\nLastly, Asian families do not split the bill, it's considered extremely rude all around.  It's almost a highlight of the meal when everyone starts jockeying for position to pay, with uncles gesticulating emphatically with each other while the aunties are trying to discreetly slip a waiter their card before anyone else notices.  The gesture of offering/competing to pay is usually enough to satisfy for etiquette's sake.  Because it was a high-end (and therefore expensive) restaurant, unless your husband had something to prove, I would wager he was knocked out of contention early.\n\nSo to recap, you were a guest at a special occasion dinner at a high-end restaurant with extended family.  Given that your son is so young, your in-laws were probably very excited to share delicacies (not just shark fin) and dishes that would be hard to find outside of this particular milieu.\n\nThis experience would have been especially significant given how food-oriented Asian cultures (not just Chinese) tend to be.  The youngest child gets the choicest morsels.  Sure, he's only a year old, so he's not going to remember what lobster noodles taste like.  But your in-laws would have cherished the memory of his first bite, and recounted it for years to come.  My own family (myself included), has fond memories of my younger sister's meditative trance as she sampled steamed tilapia for the first time.\n\nIt's fine that you ordered plain noodles, but combined with your withdrawn behaviour, your in-laws probably thought that you were feeling poorly and were worried for you and your son's health.  They likely inquired about you both afterwards out of concern, and that's where your husband telling them \"no no, she was fine all along\" comes in.\n\nTL;DR You're not the asshole for declining the shark fin, but you've needlessly alienated your in-laws because you were so focused on your moral stance.  Again, I completely agree that shark fin harvesting is cruel and ecologically destructive.  Your in-laws may feel defensive over their choice of appetizer, but more importantly, they feel that you blocked your son from a significant experience (outside of the shark fin) and robbed your in-laws of a chance to bond.  There's no telling when (or if) that opportunity may arise again.\n\nI myself am Chinese and have had multiple interracial partners, so I've had to explain these etiquette rules more than once.  I can't speculate on why your husband did not sufficiently cover for you, both at the restaurant and after the fact.", "agree that these things are culture - shark-fin soup, fois gras, sexualization of children, etc - but culture is not sacrosanct. harmful things are harmful regardless of who does them. \n\nand this isn't a fairly minor thing, like the normalization of high heels (harmful, but basically voluntary, and mostly for adults); this is widespread hunting of threatened or endangered keystone species for a delicacy.", "I think that\u2019s fair.

These pickup trucks should be illegal, but they aren't.  Learn to let things go my friend.", "NTA. I am East Asian and was raised in an Asian country. It\u2019s indeed common for traditional Chinese families to order shark fins BUT it doesn\u2019t mean we have to support it. I personally do not, and definitely would not engage in sharing it. \n\nI actually think you handled it well. Because you weren\u2019t being confrontational, you weren\u2019t comfortable eating them so you declined it\u2019s totally normal! You sat through the dinner very politely. There is no issue at all. Why must everyone eat the same thing? \n\nIt\u2019s very Chinese of him to think it\u2019s making him \u201clost face\u201d. I have experienced that first-hand from my family members, but it\u2019s not your fault. He shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed of you, his wife, for having a good moral compass. And calling you racist?! \ud83d\ude2d That\u2019s ridiculous...\n\nP.S. I\u2019m a vegan so I completely understand how Chinese culture is so heavily relied on meat and endangered species. I\u2019d not order or eat it just to be part of the group, I\u2019d probably do what you did, sit through the dinner eating the food I prefer and mind my own business. In your case, it seems to be just shark fins alone, imagine if it was me I wouldn\u2019t even touch the meat (let alone shark fins!?) and your husband would\u2019ve been so mad at me I imagine?? \ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t need to eat what they eat to fit in, and they shouldn\u2019t care if I participate in the food sharing. We can respect each other\u2019s food choices.", "NTA at all, that is so cruel. It has nothing to do with race or culture and like you said it's illegal anyway - you definitely need to have a conversation with your husband though. Dismissing your feelings when you told him you were uncomfortable and then tattling to his family is not OK.", "Whether or not you were right about the shark finning (I feel you were 1000000xs correct btw), you were not the ah as you didn't make a scene and handled it like a mature adult. Your husband on the other hand, he became the ah when he got angry at you in the first place and then even MORE of an ah when he went out of his way to call other people and get them involved in your private disagreement. What kind of a spouse does that?!\nEdit for add", "Please please pleaseeeeeee report this restaurant to the Canadian authorities!! Sharkfin is absolutely illegal in Canada and has been for years! You can remain anonymous.", "OP, your husband is the AH. Why does he call his relatives to complain about his wife?  Why isn't he just talking this out with you?\n\nMy guess is he does this with other things as well and it isn't the family unit you think it is.  You may be the outlier, given you are white.  He may be more bound to his birth family than your family unit.\n\nBeware those that complain to others about you.  They are not your friends.", ">and you didn\u2019t make a fuss about it at the table.\n\nThis is the difference between AH and NAH.  I will not go to a restaurant that serves veal  because I won't sit with someone who orders it.  I made scenes before I learned better.  I am incapable of tolerating it so now I adroitly avoid it but had I been more like OP it would have gone much better. \n\nI feel badly for OP. This is a tough spot even after she behaved graciously.", ">And that media bias is, unfortunately, rooted in cultural racism and xenophobia\n\nSince I kind of live in this world, and it's not a joke on my username, I need to pop in and heartily disagree. The emphasis on finning is, at worst, rooted in reactive activism. The image of finning a living shark and tossing the live body back into the sea to drown is alarming, it's upsetting, and it's something people remember. While bycatch is the biggest threat, it's not very sexy, and finning still represents a significant problem, particularly when done at sea (as not landing the body intact makes room for too much catch on the boat for the ecosystems to keep up with).\n\nEvery reputable shark conservation organization acknowledges this. Finning gets the front seat because it draws more emotion and the answers are simpler than trying to fix an entire industry. I can't speak for every single activist, but I haven't encountered a one that was motivated by who consumes the most shark fin. If you're looking at simply who is catching finning and exporting, Spain is one of the biggest culprits.\n\nI haven't been directly involved in a few years (my career shifted towards microplastics and other pollution), so some of my figures might be outdated. And on a personal note, I know Shiffman. He's kind if a (insert uncivil descriptor that would get me banned from aita).", "Sorry! I meant 1M as 1 year old male, not 1 month old baby!", "I\u2019ve had it and it\u2019s not super special. I think they consider it a delicacy but that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s expensive to get because the only use such a small part of the shark. \n\nNTA", "Please please report them!!!", "Yeah, honestly that's the only part that OP would be TA for, is if she doesn't report this restaurant.", "Also, how was she embarrassing him when they were at home. \n\"How could you, in front of all of these pillows!\"", "Especially since she said she was uncomfortable   (privately before the meal) and he said they would discuss it later. Then he was surprised and angry when they discussed it later? \n\nEven if it was just a cultural thing without moral implications, she is allowed to be uncomfortable with things. There are traditions in every culture that are morally questionable or just wrong. We are supposed to identify them and keep them out of our children\u2019s traditions. In this case, it was a moral issue so it is her duty to protect her son from it.", "Valuing sharks over most livestock is a pretty common position. It isn't like cows and chickens are anywhere near being on the endangered species list. If it was something like dog or horse, I could see your point.", "What makes the husband an AH in my opinion is that he involved the family in their disagreement.  That was entirely uncalled for.", "Fuck that, nobody needs  anything from a shark.", "OP is NTA one little bit. If there is a food that - for *whatever* reason - she objects to, she is not obligated to \u201ctry it\u201d or give any to her son. She was not told about this particular dish ahead of time (and it would not even occur to me to ask), so how is she obligated to \u201cinform herself\u201d on this one particular dish? It should be a simple matter of \u201c\u2018No\u2019 means \u2018No\u2019,\u201d and then let her eat her d**n noodles in peace.", "Whether banned or legal, I would no support the restaurant serving shark fins.", "Exactly!!  Husband was very disloyal!  I would not appreciate that; I\u2019d let him know it\u2019s strike 1.", "Agreed, I\u2019ve had it once many years ago before I was aware of the issues surrounding this dish and it was meh\u2026\nOn the other hand I absolutely love foie gras, but never eat it anymore since I learned about how it\u2019s made. There are so many amazing things you can eat without engaging in animal cruelty so why insist on keeping those practices?", "Thanks for this information.", "And the culture approach in its defense is flawed as well. Whaling and the harvesting of dolphin were also incredibly popular in many cultures because *they had to to get by*. They didn\u2019t have the land or climate to sustain growing populations with other food sources. It\u2019s different nowadays where eating such meals is a luxury. Not to mention- most shark meat is high in mercury which is, as most of us are aware, *toxic* when consumed. Even if it\u2019s in small doses, it\u2019s still unethical, unhealthy, and flat out unecessary.", "\u201cI told EVERYONE the Embarrassing thing you said in private! And now I\u2019m embarrassed!

Whose whole culture revolves around Eating Shark Fin Soup. They wear Shark Fins as Hats and Shark Leather clothes and all their music is made from instruments made out of the body of a Shark and all their art is Shark related. \n\nOh that\u2019s not it, they just eat Shark Fin soup once or twice a year if they\u2019re moderately wealthy?", "The way she said everyone \u201cordered soup\u201d and \u201cothers ordered fancy dishes\u201d is so sus.

Which she said quietly.", "I\u2019m glad you got a laugh out of that! We all need more laughs.", "There is one option that I haven't seen mentioned yet. I know a couple of restaurants that makes their shark fin soup from egg whites. They beat them and heat it I believe and is supposed to be similar in taste, it wasn't for me.

I grew up in a place where people have to hunt deer because previous generations wiped out the wolves. I would always shut up the people getting offended by hunters by telling them what would happen if the population didn't get culled every year. Hunting is more humane than letting nature take it's course in that case. Especially given that all the other herbivores would suffer, insect life, everything. And the farms would get wrecked so humans and animals counting on the crops would also be screwed.

Never heard of anyone eating them so it was just me being uneducated. Thanks", " Just an add on. \n\nVeal is evil no matter what while lamb *can* be humanely killed.  I am not vegetarian but will not eat either yet I can sit while someone eats lamb but cannot veal.", "To add onto that, veal comes from a young animal that was forced to remain in a very contained space for its entire life. They don't want it to move and develop muscles because that toughens the texture of the meat. \n\nThere has been *some* improvement in that the veal calves are no longer tethered in a crate. However, they're still confined and not allowed to run outside at all, they're just now confined in a pen that's big enough to stand upright fully and lie down fully in.\n\nEven for meat eaters, veal is a product that many will refuse to consume. Other such products include foie gras and the shark fin which inspired OP's post.", "So instead of eating the sharks they can have lasers attached to their heads! /s"]}
