For context as it\u2019s relevant to the situation, I (30F) am a white woman, while my husband and his family are 1st/2nd gen east and southeast Asian. \n\nWhen we originally made plans, we agreed on a local higher-end chain spot that we had been to many times in the past. However, the day before, my MIL sent us a message that her brother had switched spots to another high end Chinese restaurant. I\u2019d never been there,  but I didn\u2019t really care and was happy to go. We regularly eat and sometimes make home-cooked traditional Chinese food anyways, so there was no issue.\n\nSo we pack up our son (1M) and meet his family at this new restaurant. It was mostly nice but one thing struck me immediately. The restaurant HEAVILY advertised and displayed its shark fin soup menu. To the point that there were some fins literally hanging on display. \n\nIn our country, the sale of shark fins is illegal. It\u2019s also known to be extremely cruel (basically, the fin is removed from living sharks and the animal is left to slowly die unable to swim), and ecologically a key reason for some at-risk shark species population declines. \n\nEveryone sat down, and I was notably quiet. I quickly pulled my husband to the side to explain that I was really uncomfortable with this restaurant as it sold shark fin and try to figure out what to do. I was really anxious given the illegality of the dish and morally upset. He said we could talk about it when we got home but to please just get through the dinner.\n\nWhen it came time to order, a lot of the aunts and uncles ordered shark fin soup, while everyone else ordered fancy dishes. Internally I was still freaking out, and quickly just chose the plainest possible noodle dish (basically noodles with oil) and said I would share it with my son. I got some weird looks from my MIL and BIL since they know I regularly love Chinese food and this wouldn\u2019t be my typical order. \n\nThe food arrives and I cut up/give some of the noodles to my son (he still needs to eat) and really just pick at the rest while we\u2019re there. There is a lot of food sharing but I wouldn\u2019t participate and also blocked my son from participating. Some family made comments on my & my son\u2019s not sharing but I just laughed them off or changed the subject. There wasn\u2019t any conflict while we were at the restaurant and I tried to hide my discomfort and hold happier conversations with everyone there. \n\nWhen we got home my husband asked if I was feeling well and why I hadn\u2019t eaten more food. I told him I was uncomfortable eating shark fin and didn\u2019t want to eat at a restaurant that supported eating shark fin, and didn\u2019t want our son eating there either. He got angry and said I was embarrassing him, and I guess called a couple family members. Now I have a bunch of them messaging me saying I am racist and I am \u201cstealing my son\u2019s culture from him\u201d. \n\nAITA for not sucking it up and eating at the restaurant?", "created_utc": 1671360188, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zovut1/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_at_my_husbands_family/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Shark fin soup practices sound really really bad from what I\u2019ve learned about it, and you didn\u2019t make a fuss about it at the table. I personally wouldn\u2019t support a restaurant like that, and this has nothing to do with being racist or depriving your child of culture. It\u2019s hard to stand up to your in-laws, and I think you handled the situation really well. Just don\u2019t go to that restaurant again, regardless of who\u2019s asking.", "NTA at all!! \n\nThe sale of shark fins is largely illegal for a reason. You obviously know and are uncomfortable with the way shark fins are harvested, I am too. it\u2019s appalling. But even when they ordered shark fin soup you didn\u2019t make a scene, you just sat with your son and ate your own food.\n\nShark fin soup is not imperative to their culture, you\u2019re not stealing anything from your son.\n\nYour husband shouldn\u2019t have called his relatives to tell them, he created a much bigger problem.", "NTA. Your husband should have supported you. Time to report that restaurant (anonymously of course).", "Regardless of the sharks, anyone whose first reaction to a relationship issue is to leave their partner hanging and phoning mommy and/or other relatives and inviting them to butt in where they shouldn't have any input is an **hole. You, on the other hand, are NTA. You were put into a legitimately uncomfortable situation that you handled as best as possible. Your husband does not have your back and your relatives are using the race card were it has no relevance. But now you know that you will always be an outsider in this family.", "NTA for how you handled it.\n\nAs I don't know the specific culture that rests on shark fin soup, I won't even attempt to decide if your refusal to eat it was insulting to them.\n\nI do know that some Asian cultures are offended when a guest refuses to eat, but it's usually the food the hosts cooked.  So I'm not sure how that part even fits into the culture argument since the elders at your table didn't make the dishes.\n\nYour husband, total AH for ratting you out however.  What was his goal, to humiliate you?  To make himself look virtuous, above you, to his family?  Bad move on his part and for no good reason.", "NTA\n\nIf your husband's family tradition is to harm the environment and contribute to the extermination of an endangered species, it's not a tradition to preserve.  Just because it's traditional, just because it's part of a legacy, doesn't mean they're okay.  The same can be said for cockfights and bullfights.", "NTA - it\u2019s not racist to call out illegal and harmful traditions just because it is \u201ctheir tradition\u201d. In this logic they could just get away with whatever and say it\u2019s their tradition and if you don\u2019t like it you are racist.", "Info: would they have been upset if you\u2019d ordered normally instead of just plain noodles, or were they specifically offended by you not eating shark fin? It\u2019s possible they view you barely eating anything as kind of a passive aggressive statement.", "NTA. You handled the situation as best as you could --- didn't make a scene but stuck to your mortals.", "So very much NTA! I wouldn\u2019t have been able to sit there so tactfully and not make snarky passive aggressive comments. You did beautifully under trying circumstances!", "NTA. It's illegal for a reason and if I were you I'd report the shit out of that restaurant.", "Info: is there any possibility they're using a substitute and you didn't realize? Just kind of hanging onto a glimmer of hope there.\n\nIf that is the case they're all jerks for not just *saying* \"it isn't real shark fin\".\n\nI also think it's a huge problem that your husband basically tattled to mommy and brought his family in to harass you when you literally did not make a scene.", "Is the serving of shark fin illegal? In Canada the importation and trade of shark fin not naturally attached is not permitted but whole carcasses are. \n\nThat said, NTA. Whether permitted or not, there are serious ecological, sustainability issues with the shark fin trade. Shark fin is considered a delicacy and not part of the day to day cuisine. It's be an imperceptible cultural loss for your son. The language, customs, art, music and lots of other food, let alone relationships with elders is more impactful.", "NTA", "Info: was the only thing on the menu shark fin related? If not, did they only order things with shark fin? \n\nI don\u2019t think your TA for not eating the shark fin. But if there were other dishes I feel like that could have been eaten shared, if not by you but by your son. \n\nIn the totality, I think NTA. \nPersonally, I would check whether or not they were doing something illegal. If they were I would personally feel compelled to report it.", "Nta", "NTA. At all. I completely agree with you. Just the thought of it makes me sick. Having to see it would set me off. I understand that it is a cultural thing, but as someone who is fascinated with marine biology and loves sharks I just couldn't deal. You handled that very well in my opinion. I would have noped the F outta there.\n\nEdit to add: Also your husband never should have called his family and told them. He turned it into a bigger deal than it needed to be. Especially since you told him at the beginning you were uncomfortable about the soup.", "NTA\n\nAlso, if it\u2019s illegal\u2026report the place", "NTA You handled the situation very well. You did not raise a stink, you were polite through dinner and you did not make the meal about you. You were right in being uncomfortable and are allowed to have those feelings  (I never even heard of shark fin soup before this post so I\u2019d have no idea if I encountered it). But you did nothing wrong.", "Ugh. Chinese woman here. I HATE when people pull out the racist card when it's not racist. It just diminishes actual racism and gets white people on this reverse racism shit. Not okay. You're allowed to dislike and not eat something that is illegal here. You have eaten Chinese food and even say you love it. Your in laws know this. This wasn't being racist, or rude, you were very respectful given the circumstances. Good for you. As a mama to half Asian boys - remember that YOUR culture is equally important too!! Remind your hubby's family that your son is also apart of your culture, as he is mixed, and will experience different cultures but will NOT participate in illegal activity!!", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s illegal. I would have walked out and reported them", "NTA His family is embarrassing themselves by supporting a restaurant that promotes shark fin soup. I would have refused to order/eat anything in such a restaurant. \n\nAnd to be honest I would have told the aunts and uncles they're barbarians for eating it themselves. No point in mincing words.\n\nJust because it's a cultural practice does not make it acceptable. Foot binding was a cultural practice. It stopped because it could not be justified.\n\nBut I am confused. You were not back in China? You were actually in a country where shark fin is illegal? Why not report the restaurant. How is it even still open?", "NTA. Shark fin soup is not only illegal, it's morally repugnant purely for the extreme cruelty of the method of \"harvest\". I'm on your side, I wouldn't want to eat there either. Your husband is lucky you didn't make a scene *at* the restaurant, and is a massive AH for not realising that when you told him you weren't happy at the restaurant *that meant that you weren't happy at the restaurant*. \n\nTrust me, shark fin soup is *not* so culturally important that not eating it affects how Asian he is. Report the restaurant.", "INFO: I'm sure you ate the other animals they had in the menu,  but you drew the line at shark fin, right? Whatever.

To be fair to the restaurant I didn\u2019t ask if it was a potential substitute. They did have displayed fins but I guess they could have been fake/decorative, I didn\u2019t really get close enough to investigate. I did some quick googling now and they do show up under a list of sellers on an activist website, but it\u2019s also possible that list just scrapes for \u201cshark fin\u201d on the menu.

I know it may not do much but worth doing it. \n\nI'm mostly hoping it's a substitute because they're so brazenly displaying their use of an illegal ingredient.  But I know regulation isn't always great so they may just be getting away with it.\n\nJust a quick Google but you can make something that looks like shark fin, such as for display, with agar agar.  They'll also use these for substitutes in the soup itself - \"chicken breast, jinhua ham, vermicelli, soy, sea cucumber, bird's nest, pig's skin and gelatin\"\n\nAdmittedly I watch a lot of cooking shows where people make one food look like another food so I'm aware of the tricks they can use to make it look real when it isn't so yeah *hoping* it's not real but sadly would not be surprised if it is.\n\nAnd, again, if they knew this wasn't real shark fin *they are still assholes* because instead of just saying \"oh no we don't condone that either, this is actually [substitute]\" they're just attacking you.\n\nIt's not racist to oppose animal cruelty and illegal practices.", "Sorry I should clarify - the restaurant definitely does also sell non-shark items and some people ordered other dishes. The family did order a fair amount of it overall though. I didn\u2019t want to be in the situation of being OK with sharing with some people and not others, and then having to go into the whole dilemma while they were literally eating the soup. I thought it would be easier to just not share at all so the dinner wasn\u2019t super awkward."]}
