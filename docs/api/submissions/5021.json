For context as it\u2019s relevant to the situation, I (30F) am a white woman, while my husband and his family are 1st/2nd gen east and southeast Asian. \n\nWhen we originally made plans, we agreed on a local higher-end chain spot that we had been to many times in the past. However, the day before, my MIL sent us a message that her brother had switched spots to another high end Chinese restaurant. I\u2019d never been there,  but I didn\u2019t really care and was happy to go. We regularly eat and sometimes make home-cooked traditional Chinese food anyways, so there was no issue.\n\nSo we pack up our son (1M) and meet his family at this new restaurant. It was mostly nice but one thing struck me immediately. The restaurant HEAVILY advertised and displayed its shark fin soup menu. To the point that there were some fins literally hanging on display. \n\nIn our country, the sale of shark fins is illegal. It\u2019s also known to be extremely cruel (basically, the fin is removed from living sharks and the animal is left to slowly die unable to swim), and ecologically a key reason for some at-risk shark species population declines. \n\nEveryone sat down, and I was notably quiet. I quickly pulled my husband to the side to explain that I was really uncomfortable with this restaurant as it sold shark fin and try to figure out what to do. I was really anxious given the illegality of the dish and morally upset. He said we could talk about it when we got home but to please just get through the dinner.\n\nWhen it came time to order, a lot of the aunts and uncles ordered shark fin soup, while everyone else ordered fancy dishes. Internally I was still freaking out, and quickly just chose the plainest possible noodle dish (basically noodles with oil) and said I would share it with my son. I got some weird looks from my MIL and BIL since they know I regularly love Chinese food and this wouldn\u2019t be my typical order. \n\nThe food arrives and I cut up/give some of the noodles to my son (he still needs to eat) and really just pick at the rest while we\u2019re there. There is a lot of food sharing but I wouldn\u2019t participate and also blocked my son from participating. Some family made comments on my & my son\u2019s not sharing but I just laughed them off or changed the subject. There wasn\u2019t any conflict while we were at the restaurant and I tried to hide my discomfort and hold happier conversations with everyone there. \n\nWhen we got home my husband asked if I was feeling well and why I hadn\u2019t eaten more food. I told him I was uncomfortable eating shark fin and didn\u2019t want to eat at a restaurant that supported eating shark fin, and didn\u2019t want our son eating there either. He got angry and said I was embarrassing him, and I guess called a couple family members. Now I have a bunch of them messaging me saying I am racist and I am \u201cstealing my son\u2019s culture from him\u201d. \n\nAITA for not sucking it up and eating at the restaurant?", "created_utc": 1671360188, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zovut1/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_at_my_husbands_family/", "score": 259, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I lived in China for 9 years and food culture has a whole different aspect that I am 100000% sure you haven't seen all of, even though you married into the family.  Yes, food sharing is part of the culture.  It is seen as a politeness and a way of showing that there is room for all and that all are important. It comes from a history of there being times of lack and the focus on everybody being equals and important.  It comes from a place of respect.  Just because YOU don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't important.\n\nAll cultures have food oddities.  Many religions will not eat pork.  Other cultures will not eat beef.

You had a private conversation with your husband about it, then you ate lightly, and went home. Your husband thought you were feeling ill, and likely others at the table thought the same thing, so it was only by HIM calling people to tell them why you didn't eat that this became a problem for anyone else there. \n\nIgnore the messages from his family, and tell your husband due to HIS actions his family is calling you racist, and he can deal with that because now you aren't going to be around people that would call you racist. That is fully on him to deal with, and honestly, I wouldn't be around anyone who would text/tell me that. \n\nAnd it isn't racist to uncomfortable with animal cruelty. Sure, most of us- of all cultures across the globe- participate in practices/food that are cruel to animals and do a host of other practices that are bad for the environment or society. But, we are all allowed to decide how to navigate that, and I think a fair one is not participating in actions deemed so bad they are illegal like shark fin soup or items made out of ivory. \n\nThat's a very reasonable boundary, to not want to eat illegal food and support a business that does, and again, you were very polite and nonconfrontational in your discomfort.

The rest of the animal is too ureic and is fucking nasty.

Theoretically, the majority of the animal does get used, just not in the same restaurant.\n\nWhat *was* happening is that they\u2019d just get the fins, throw the rest back and waste a lot of meat trying to maximise their profit-space ratio.
