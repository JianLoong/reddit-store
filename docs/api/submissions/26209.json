It\u2019s not like these people were gonna arrive soon and OP probably knew that (spoiler: even with all that, they still got there almost 3 hours late) and while canceling right when they arrived was AH behavior, they already mentioned this is a common occurrence so this was their breaking point. \n\nMaybe the husband should learn to respect people\u2019s time instead of blaming others for his mistakes, and the friend should realize they\u2019re enablers here.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not trying to villainize the friend either. Them being late wasn\u2019t their fault and OP did right by apologizing to them, but hopefully this experience will help them realize that their boyfriend is being disrespectful and quite simply a dick.", "This website's relationship with real human social interactions is tenuous at best", "Run itself is likely taking an hour and half or so. You ok-ed it at 10:22, at that moment the original meetup time is just not relevant anymore."]}
