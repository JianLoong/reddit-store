I haaaaate people being late, I find it super disrespectful, but your lack of communication and boundary setting was outrageously bad in this situation. You had multiple opportunities (HOURS) to communicate with them and tell them that you weren't okay with them taking so much time, that this wasn't working for you, that you had different expectations for the day. You KNOW the husband is not a punctual person and you gave him a \"yeah that's fine\" until they show up at your door and then you LAUGH and turn them away.  That is SO passive aggressive and inappropriate. YTA", "YTA. You call a brunch for 10:30. At noon you're asking the guests to bring some eggs??  You plan a brunch but don't have ingredients??
