I would talk to your grandparents and have them help you navigate with your mom and sister or see if you can live with them full time.", "NTA but your mom is and grandparents ESH.  You can never make up to kids when there are multiple other parents with some who choose to step up and some who don't.  All your sister will remember is that your grandparents do more for you than her.  You having no one else as the justification - in her mind that sounds like she's being punished for having an involved Dad.  It makes sense that she would have issues as your grandparents should treat you both equally.  It's not their job to makeup for anything and them doing so creates a rift between you and your sibling.  All around a terrible situation for you but if you go to live with your grandparents, your relationship with your sister will further go downhill.", "NTA\n\nYou spoke the truth and they didn't want to hear it, I'm only surprised you waited this long to blow up at them about it. I'm so sorry that your mom let you down in life (so far, she could still turn it around). Your sister is speaking with her father's voice, not that it makes it any better and she's old enough to start thinking for herself.", "NTA you reached your breaking point and let out the harsh truth. Your sister and mom are both awful people and need to get over themselves. The problems they have were started by them, not you. Ignore them \ud83d\ude11 their anger is not warranted. You're just a kid who got caught up in a shit storm. Hopefully things go over well and your sister grows up because she's 19. And your mom needs to get over her ex already, she's been a grown ass adult for the 16 years you've been alive.", "NTA, your mom created a toxic situation for you and your sister. It can't be a surprise for your mom that you resent her. No one can blame you either. I have a younger sister that is a product of an affair. I put the blame on the adults.", "Wow, that's bad... NTA by the way, except for losing it.\n\nYour sister is clearly an asshole influenced by her father and incapable of thinking for herself.\n\nAs for your mother, I understand her frustration, she must feel guilty towards you and she doesn't understand why you are not more frustrated by this situation.  \nYou should talk to her calmly and make her understand that you don't care about this man's actions. Instead, it's the way she keep rubing it in your face that's frustrating. Not sure i'm clear here...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
