You can never make up to kids when there are multiple other parents with some who choose to step up and some who don't.

It makes sense that she would have issues as your grandparents should treat you both equally.  It's not their job to makeup for anything and them doing so creates a rift between you and your sibling.  All around a terrible situation for you but if you go to live with your grandparents, your relationship with your sister will further go downhill.", "NTA\n\nYou spoke the truth and they didn't want to hear it, I'm only surprised you waited this long to blow up at them about it.

But I really don't expect anything to help. My sister would never go to therapy with me. I think mom is also too set in her ways to listen to a therapist. She's so convinced she's totally right.", "OP, of course they did... not because you are even close to an ahole or did anything remotely wrong.\n\nThey are furious at you and blaming you because (have not already noticed?) they never take responsibility for themselves.\n\nHere's your mom: She cheated and ended up with a child whose dad is not in the picture. She decides it's the poor guy she cheated on's responsibility to do for you what he does for his daughter. (Sometimes it works out, but it's nothing that other adult owes.) She doesn't even own up to the guy that SHE's the one who wants him to do things for you; she keeps saying that you want it. She's never going to see herself as being responsible for diddly-squat.\n\nI do give your sister a little more slack. She's learned to have this negative, blame-others mentality from your mom. She bought your mom's unhealthy way of bean-counting and expecting others to not short-change her in any way. But she either needs to break free from that influence and think for herself, or she becomes responsible for her own warped view of things.\n\nBTW, I'd make sure that you say to her dad once: \"*I never have wanted you to play dad for me; never wanted you to give me anything or do anything for me. That's what my mom wants. The only thing I expect from you is to treat me with basic decency and respect, as you would any other person. Do not blame me for my mom's actions. I am not her.*\"", "I'm so sorry that you are forced to be around such a set of awful people. NTA, and I'm afraid it's not likely to get better until/unless you can get away from them.", "NTA. You have been squeezed. This is the natural reaction.", "NTA, your mom and sister though... Can you go live with your grandparents cause they seem like the only reasonable people in your life.", ">I would talk to your grandparents... see if you can live with them full time.\n\nI think Op's sister will react like that is a nuclear option and that it completely proves her point about them favoring OP.  If OP wants a relationship with their sister, this could destroy any chance.", ">Your sister is clearly an asshole influenced by her father and incapable of thinking for herself.\n\nHow is any of this his fault?  He has never met OP and the sister is angry at her mom's affair, OP's existence and the Grandparent's for what she claims is favoritism.  The sister's dad is literally not involved at all.  What are you blaming him for?", "Honestly your mum is the #1 AH in the story. Sister is #2 (I don\u2019t get her, if my mum cheated on my dad, I would keep contact to a bare minimum and would not even bother with her side of the family).  \n\nYou are NTA, I feel sorry for you.", "Do not apologize. What they have done is worse and you will never hear an apology from either of them. They don\u2019t get to play the victim when you communicate unhappiness with their actions. Their actions and words have consequences and you have been dealing with their consequences your entire life. It\u2019s time for those consequences to be on them.\n\nAlso, I really hope that what your sister says doesn\u2019t affect you. Your birth is in no way shape or form your fault, nor does it say anything about you. If she has a problem with affair babies she should be going after your mother for having an affair.\n\nI hope your grandparents continue to be a port in the storm and I hope they support you through this time. It might get rough, but stay strong and stand up tall. You have done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING wrong.", "Considering their age her sister was around 3 years old when OP was born so they grew up together, yeah siblings are not necesseraly close to each other.\n\nYes she is jealous of the grandparents attention toward OP, but the \"disgusting little affair baby\" and other remarks of that kind dont come from nowhere and i hardly believe it come from their mother (*dont know since when it has become so bad though*).\n\nHer sister's father on the other have never hidden his rejection toward OP \"*her ex always told her to go to hell and he wasn't taking me anywhere*\"... children quickly register this kind of information, if the process is constant they will imitate their parents especially when it allows them to justify themselves.   \nIt's a no brainer way to attack her sister, she is not even original and seems to stick to the only thing she know to use.\n\n\"*Mom was with my sister's dad and cheated on him*\" no he didn't ask for that, yes he resent his ex-wife, but the child born from the affair never asked to be born, it's too easy to take it on them but he still do it and his daughter felt it since childhood.", "None of what you said is mentioned and if anything, the fact he wasn\u2019t mentioned is proof that he isn\u2019t involved. Op\u2019s sister isn\u2019t yelling daddy in these arguments, and if he was influencing her, she wouldn\u2019t be able to help herself and mention his opinion, his statement or his beliefs.  But she\u2019s not mentioning her father because he\u2019s not involved.\n\nHer complaints are OP existence which broke up her parent\u2019s marriage in her opinion, and that existence, according to her ruined her life, especially when she thinks it was further ruined by the favoritism for OP. Again, none of her opinions mention Daddy but they all seem to coexistence around OP\u2019s existence ruining her life.\n\nif Daddy was involved, he would\u2019ve been Weaponized and OP would hate him as well. The fact that OP just feels bad for him shows you he wasn\u2019t involved and has no influence on his kid. You can hate the adultery baby without parental influence, especially when it\u2019s easier to blame them then the parent who committed adultery for all of your problems.\n\nAlso, refusing to participate in the affair child\u2019s life is not proof of resentment or anger or hatred or being a bad person.  Even good people with great coparenting and even parenting skills do not owe their participation to their ex-wife\u2019s affair child simply because they exist even though the ex-wife thinks otherwise. As for the yelling, she\u2019s been harassing him for 16 years and he snapped at her. It\u2019s unfortunate her child heard, but OP\u2019s mother is responsible for putting her child in that situation not the ex for reacting to continued harassment for 16 years.", "\"She's so convinced she's totally right.\"\n\nIs there any truth to it?  You mention you got one on one time but did she as well growing up? If she never got one on one time and you did her point would be valid."]}
