Even her bringing over her own pizza when you told her you were cooking is insulting, much less telling you to order it.  NTA", "NTA \n\nshe can eat wtf y\u2019all made\u2026 and if she wanted pizza that bad then go on ur phone a Google it. She just wanted a reason not to come.", "NTA. You invited your sister into your home, and you were preparing food for her to eat. There's not much more you needed to do. You were not required to order special food or sing hymns to your sister to get her to join you.  \n\nAlso, your sister got into a pissing contest with you, not the other way around.", "NTA.  If your sister insists on eating pizza other than the dinner you've prepared, she should order/pickup her own. I suppose you could have made a concession for the sake of your mom, but so could your sister! She's the one who decided to turn around and go home, not you.", "NTA. Your wife and you were making dinner. Why was your sister so adamant on getting pizza? If she wanted it, pull over and search for a nearby pizza place and get it herself. She's a grown up. If anything I'd wait a day to get some pizza and just eat what your wife was serving. She can't control her cravings for a pizza for one day? \n\nI'm sure your mom was upset not at you though. Everyone needs to stop babying the little sister (myself included).", "NTA.  Wtf??  Your sister sounds like a drama-queen shit stirrer.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. It sounds like your sister was invited for dinner as a guest at your home and I struggle to understand why she felt entitled to make demands regarding the meal like that. It was ok for her to ask but when you mentioned the plan for dinner she should have dropped it. I understand a pizza craving, I love pizza, but she can get it another time. I will make a side note that it sounds like you and your sister probably don\u2019t have a great relationship and you probably could have made more of an effort to make her for welcome for your moms sake", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI totally get why you said she's \"welcome\" in that way. She sounds exhausting. Your mom needs to be mad at her and your wife needs to but out.", "NTA\n\nYou and your wife were making dinner. She didn't even ask what you were making, but demanded pizza instead.\n\nAnd her not knowing what's close to you...there's this fancy thing called Google maps that let's you find food near or on route to your destination. \n\n\nShe could have came, she choose not too because she wasn't getting her way.", "Going for NTA.  \n\n\nBased on this story it sounds like the sister was already in for a fight. First she was rude by asking to order her a pizza while you are cooking dinner. Where I live that is rude, unless there is a very good reason for it. \n\nThan she started to ask questions while being angry. And those were the kind of questions with no right answer.  \n\n\nBecause if you agreed, you would become a doormat. And if you disagreed she would start to yell. And if you play neutral and let her make her own choices... This would happen.", "NTA. I\u2019m astounded at all the yta responses here. Sister was invited to someone\u2019s home as a guest for dinner, and instead called to say that OP should arrange take-out for her simply because she wanted it and couldn\u2019t be bothered to pull over and order it. What obnoxious, entitled behavior. And somehow since OP didn\u2019t accommodate her AH behavior enough, he\u2019s the problem? Furthermore she wanted him to beg her to come after causing all the drama to begin with? I wouldn\u2019t have done it either.", "NTA, she was invited to have dinner with you guys. If her insistence on pizza was such a big deal, she could have ordered when she got there, or picked it up on the way. I hate when people do this kind of crap. There were several ways your sister could have handled this better, rather than acting like a brat.", "Honestly, I think ESH.\n\nNo, you're not an AH for the pizza thing. She should've ordered it herself, or just asked you to recommend a place where she could.\n\nBut the stuff about asking if you wanted her there... That sort of behavior is a bid for validation. So you saying she was \"welcome\" to come is rejecting her bid. All you had to say was that you did want her there. I get that the pizza stuff was annoying, but there's no reason to escalate a situation if you don't have to. \n\nSo much conflict on this sub happens because people want to be right or petty instead of coming to an understanding.", "JFC your sister is exhausting. NTA.", "[deleted]", "I've got to go ESH on this one, between you and your sister. \n\nUnless there's a particularly good reason she didn't want to eat whatever dinner was being served (food restrictions or whatever), why was she so insistent on pizza, rather than eating what was offered? Kinda rude to go to someone's house for dinner and insist that their food isn't good enough for you.\n\nBut telling her to order it herself, when she doesn't know what pizza place in the neighborhood to order from, and she's DRIVING and shouldn't be on the phone? Yeah, total AH move there. Just do her the favor of ordering it for her, and let her pay you back.", "YTA. You have no problem with her bringing her own food, but you won't actually help guide her since she doesn't know your area. Then you basically tell her you don't want her there. They should all be pissed at you for being a childish d-bag.", "Sounds like you are, yup. Or at least you can't stand your sister but don't have the nuts to actually be honest about it or why. YTA.", "YTA-- while she was a bit of an ah for the pizza thing why did you have to play the semantics game of stubbornly refusing to say you \"wanted\" her to come.", "ESH her slight tho.  She could have eaten what your wife was making.\n\nYou were an AH all around.  She asked you to do her a favor.  The very least you could have done was order her the dang pizza.  \n\nPizza issue aside.  Then when she asked if you wanted her there you never said you did and said your *mom* wanted to see her.  So yea you started unnecessary drama instead of just saying you wanted to see her.", "YTA and were being overly difficult. It was a VERY simple request from your sister who was working and driving and didn't know best place to order. You decided to be an asshole all around. Way to go. That wasn't babying her that was being a shit for no reason. YOU are in the wrong here.", "YTA, but not for refusing to order her a pizza. You're an asshole for not directly answering her question and \"pleading the 5th\" on whether you wanted her to come. You could have easily handled this differently but chose to make it difficult.", "YTA - this sounds like you didn't want her to come over.\n\nI don't know what's going on, but it's a very strange place to draw a line in the sand. *You can have your own food, but I will not lift a single finger to help you get your food here, even though you'll pay me back, and I know that you can't really find your own food because you're driving and don't know the area.* \n\nDo you even know what you were trying to accomplish in that interaction? Was it just pettiness? Was it showing you could be the smaller person? Do you get a high on being \"*principled*\" while acting like a jerk?", "ESH Both you and your sister are at fault for allowing a silly argument over pizza get in the way of your Mom seeing her.", "Unless your sister has a history of getting you to pay for stuff she wants, ESH. She was driving & while she *could* have pulled over & tried to figure out a place to get pizza, you were sitting at home with a phone in your hand. Y'all sound like drama.", "YTA--in no uncertain terms\n\nIt would have taken you 1 minute to do this for your sister, but you wanted to aggravate her for some reason. I totally understand why she asked if you actually wanted her to come over, and you could not even be nice and welcoming about THAT. It seems you have some resentment built up towards your sister, and you should deal with it instead of playing passive-aggressive games with her. She was asking you to do her a favor, that is not \"babying\".", "ESH. She sucks for demanding special dinner just for her. You suck for not answering her question when she asked if you wanted her to come.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
