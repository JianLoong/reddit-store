They always did their best and cared for Max, often at the expense of completely ignoring Alex and I. However, Alex stayed back in the city and worked with dad, I left as soon as I turned 18. So I was LC with them.\n\nUnfortunately my parents both passed away during covid and because I was in a different state altogether, Alex and his family took Max in and started caring for him. \n\nI got a call from Alex, asking me to visit him so that we could talk about Max. So I did. Alex told me he was physically and emotionally exhausted from caring for Max, that he couldn't spend as much time with his wife and son as he would like to, and asked me to temporarily take Max back home with me. \n\nWell I currently live with my wife (30F) and our two little ones (2F and 5F). My wife has a demanding job. Even though I'm a SAHM, I barely have time for myself.  Alex insisted that my wife could easily afford to hire help, and take care of Max. I told him I emotionally ready to take him in.\n\nAlex told me he was disappointed in me and that he thought Max would be more valuable in my opinion. There was a really long argument there.\n\nI came home and told my wife all about this. She agrees with me that taking Max in wouldn't be podsible for us but she suggested we could look for a facility or group home that can meet all his needs for him and pay for it. \n\nI offered Alex the solution I'd found. He called me a heartless monster, and a terrible sister for even suggesting that, and said Max was our brother and he should be at home with his family where he belongs. \n\nI feel like such a horrible person for not wanting to do this. No matter how much my wife tells me this is Alex' frustration with the situation misplaced towards me, I still feel like I am in the wrong.

A group home with qualified caretakers would be the best thing for everyone, and your parents should have set this up prior to passing.", "NTA. Your wife is right that the best solution here is to look for a group home or other facility for Max. Alex should also understand that you can\u2019t unilaterally make that decision-obviously your wife needs to be involved. And she said no. Also pretty bold of him to assume that your wife will just pony up the cash for a carer for Max. He\u2019s being very presumptuous and you have to stand up for yourself.", "NTA your parents long before covid should have made plans for Max\u2019s care in the event of their passing. Your brother can have his perspective on what the care should look like and you may have yours. He\u2019s stressed out from his efforts bc he\u2019s family not a trained professional. This is why being in a facility is best. If he feels thst strongly about it he can take him back later.", "NTA. I know group homes can sound scary but the right group home can help your brother obtain a sense of normalcy and independence. You have your own life and your own family that you've been building, and you don't have to uproot or change that for anybody.", "You are NTA, but your brother surely is.\n\n>Please come visit me so that we can talk.  \n>  \n>I want you to take Max with you when you return home.\n\nWhat the actual fuck?!?\n\nThat's not anywhere close to a fair request to make of someone with a partner and small children. He sprang a trap on you and tried to guilt you into taking on a huge, unexpected responsibility.\n\nYou not immediately agreeing to take him in and care for him is completely reasonable. You wanting to look for a facility or group home for your brother is, too. You are not Max's parent. You are not responsible for caring for him just because Alex doesn't want to any longer.\n\nA reasonable request from Alex would have been, \"I am really hoping you'll allow Max to move in with you and that you and your partner will hire someone to help care for him. Please go home and talk it over with your partner. Think about it for a couple of days. Let's plan on your and me talking about it again a week from now.\"\n\nThere are a number of practical considerations, too. What agreement did Alex have with your parents? Did your parents set up any sort of trust to provide for Max? Did Alex inherit money or property that was supposed to be used for Max's support? Why isn't Alex hiring a caregiver for Max and letting him stay where he is? And, if Alex is emotionally exhausted after only a couple of years of caring for Max, how much of an AH does he have to be to insult you and call you heartless for not jumping at the opportunity to take over as Max's guardian?", "NTA at all. I have a friend who cared for a sibling with severe non verbal autism for years before he just mentally and physically couldn\u2019t do it anymore. And he had NO KIDS! It\u2019s admirable when family is close enough and has the time, space, energy to take in and care for a disabled family member, but by no means does it make you a bad person for not doing it. A facility is 100% the best way to go, they have full time employees with training and resources to deal with this sort of thing. Do your research, find a good facility, and meet with your brother with literature in hand about the place.", "NTA, life isn\u2019t easy, and as unfortunate as it is that your older brother got the load he cannot force you. A facility might not be the best fit but what about everyone paying for a caregiver instead?", "So your brother blindsided you alone and said \"Take our brother home with you\" WTF.   \n\nNTA - Your brother is having a tough time. An adult way to handle this is to call a meeting of the siblings and chat it out. Max is your responsibility (in regards to being family) but that does not mean you should be expected to just take him in. Especially with no mental or physical prep. OR even time to think it over with your spouse!  \n\nIf Max is impossible for your brother to handle long-term- than of course you should look for other caregiver options.   \nSome people firmly believe family should always be with family. But many of us do not have the capacity to provide a good quality place for a family member. I could not care for an aging parent or an adult child with mental/emotional disabilities. I just couldn't. My life is not set up that way.  \n\nN T  A and good luck!", "NTA - your brother no longer wants to care for him so is trying to put this responsibility on you. \n\nHe calls you heartless for wanting to put him in a facility which offers the best possible care, when he's trying to get him out his own house - hypocritical.", "NTA.\n\n>she suggested we could look for a facility or group home that can meet all his needs for him and pay for it.\n\nThis is the solution and Alex's frustration at his own burnout IS misdirected to you. A facility like this is not prison--you'll all be able to visit Max and remain in his life, without having to burn out while doing so.", "NTA- sometimes living with family allows the special needs person to stay more of a kid, where as in a group home they are giving them the chance to live like an adult and teach them the skills needed. Some will also have contacts to help them get a basic job so they feel they have purpose.\n\nAlso look into respite care, instead of your bro having him 24/7, Max could go to a day camp or week long camp every few months so he can have time alone with this family.\n\nYour brother sounds stuck in the 'must be with family all the time' mentality which is not healthy. \n\nI used to volunteer with a group that would take adult special needs out for social events on a weekly basis so the families could have down time. I really enjoyed it, we went to concerts, dances, bowling, ice skating, horse riding and stand up comedy.  For them its going out with friends and getting to do fun things.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents should have ensured Max would be provided for when they died. You went LC 12 years ago. There should be no expectation of your involvement in this situation or anything with the family.\n\nHold firm and don't allow Max into the house under any circumstances until Alex and you come to terms.\n\nIt's really common for the \"family\" to expect the girl children to take care of any siblings - and sometimes parents - after one or both parents die. You stepped away to avoid that. Don't let Alex shame you into taking Max in now.\n\nEspecially since you and your wife are willing to help with placement in a facility. IF Alex doesn't want to compromise, he can take care of Max.", "NTA. A good group home can provide the care that Max needs. Sometimes they thrive when they\u2019re given the opportunity.", "NTA. There are several community living options with very good organizations that would not only take good care of Max, but would also help teach him new skills and enable him to go out and be a part of his community. I used to work for Easter Seals Midwest and a huge part of it was helping the individual be more independent and be a part of their community. I can understand Alex's concerns (I have an older brother with Down Syndrome who is nonverbal who could not easily tell us if someone was being mean to him), but there are mechanisms in place to help minimize any risks. A lot of these places are also focused on placing the individual in the community of their choice which, more often than not, is close to their family, so you or Alex, depending on who is closer, could visit him as often as you want. It is unfair of Alex to try to guilt you into doing what he wants and to call you a heartless monster when you  and your wife have come up with a perfectly viable solution.", "\n\n>said Max was our brother and he should be at home with his family where he belongs.\n\nfrom an emotional standpoint, I get this sentiment, but logically it just never makes sense. alex is burning his family to the ground, and expects you to do the same, rather than let max go somewhere where all his needs can be met. if that's Alex's choice, then so be it, but its on him to shoulder the burden of making that choice. NTA it shouldn't have ever been either of your responsibility to put your lives on hold for max, and your parents are the real assholes for not having this sorted before they died, but at this point the choice to keep burning the candle at both ends is Alex's and his alone.", "NTA, if he wants to pass your brother\u2019s care of to you it\u2019s your choice how you do said care. If he doesn\u2019t like the option that works best for your family and your brother than he can continue to care for him", "NTA\n\nThis is speaking as a parent of a child who is on the spectrum, and has significant additional needs. Taking on that kind of responsibility for the care of another human being, is not something that should be done unless you are 100% certain that it is what you want to do.\n\nIf your brother thinks that Max can only be taken care of by family, then he needs to be the one doing it. Not trying to guilt trip you into doing it, because he doesn't want to do it anymore. \n\nCaring for someone with additional needs is not a decision to be made lightly, and absolutely should not be done by anyone who is not emotionally able, and prepared to take it on. If you don't feel like you can, then you definitely should not. \n\nYou've presented a very viable, and reasonable alternative, and that's all you can do at this point.", "NTA. You don't have the time, energy, or means while also caring for 2 young kids. Even if you didn't have little ones, that's fine; you don't appear to be abandoning the issue. Some people simply do not have the fortitude to be a 24/7 caretaker.\n\nIf you were just \"dumping\" Max in a home and wiping your hands of him, that would be Y T A. But if you will be checking in on him, visiting, etc.; then what you've offered to do for him is probably the best option for all 3 siblings.", "NTA. Alex can either keep caring for him, or find him a good group home where he'll be happy and well cared for. You aren't doing anything wrong. Max needs more care than either you or Alex can provide.", "NTA  And I guarantee this wouldn't be temporary--there would be one reason or another why Max can't go back to Alex", "NTA\nPeople need to stop looking at group homes like they're a bad thing. It's a place where people can grow on their own and learn their independence. It could possibly be his best option in the long run.", "NTA. You suggested a completely reasonable solution, and it is not your fault that your brother doesn\u2019t like it. He just told you about how exhausted he is due to taking care of your younger brother and is now expecting you to change your entire life to do the same work. If he wants him to be in a home with family so badly, he can keep him and stop complaining about being the one that decided to take him in.", "Nope NTA and stop overthinking!!", "NTA. Your parents should have set something up before they passed", "Maybe offer to pay for some help for the brother? No one should be forced into being a caregiver and your parents should have taken care of this well before they passed. NTA", "Nta\n\nNeither is either of your brothers. The big ahs are your parents. They should have had a plan on place of your brother was going to need a caretaker for the rest of his life. If your other brother agreed to this freely and without threat or coercion from your parents, then he is an ah.", "NTA. Any responsible parent has a plan set up for care for their kid when they die - regardless of abilities. I wonder what was/if your parents planned.\n\nA group home or facility is the best option for everyone involved. If Alex is insistent that Max live with family, he is welcome to continue living there.", "NTA, your wife is right. Alex can either keep Max or accept your solution.", ">Alex told me he was physically and emotionally exhausted from caring for Max, that he couldn't spend as much time with his wife and son as he would like to\n\nSo now this is what he wants you to do even though he has experienced the same thing. He wants you to sacrifice your life and home to take care of a brother that has barely seen you and would probably be better off in a home with professionals to care for him.\n\nUnderstand where he is coming from but he is out of line. Your offer is reasonable and wpuld work better for all.\n\nNTA", "NTA. For the same reason we were NTA for putting my father in law in a nursing home- he needs to be somewhere where he can be monitored 24 hours, and is safe and can't run away. A place with programs that will help him. A place that can deal with medical problems. Not at your place, where you have too many responsibilities to watch him closely.\n\nYour brother has good intentions, but he is helping no one with his intransigence.", "NTA, caring for someone with disabilities is EXTREMELY difficult. I also believe he should be in a group home. He will receive care appropriate to his needs, make some friends and do activities you wouldn't have time to do with himself yourself. There is nothing stopping anyone taking him home for family time either. \n\nIt's a little bit like my dad. He has dementia, after my mum died he was home all alone. I could have taken him to live with me but that's not really fair to him. He needs to be with people his own age and with people who understand his needs. He loves the home he is in, has settled in easily and is loving life again.", "Oh. NTA. This must be so hard. Would be no one's an AH but your older brother is wrong. Max could be well taken care of by people who won't be so emotionally exhausted. He could visit. But he'd get the care he needed by people well suited to providing it.", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s generous offer is exactly what you should do. I am in the same position having to care for a disabled sibling. We tried and thought about keeping him in our home but it is just not fair or possible. Stick to your guns. He needs a team to care for him. You and your brother can visit when you want but knowing your brother is being taken care of 24/7 is the best option.", "NTA\n\nIf he should be with family, then why is your brother trying so hard to not do it? Easy answer - because it's not feasible for almost everybody. It's utterly unfair for him to decide you should do a thing that he absolutely knows he can't handle, either. The group home sounds like a perfect option.", "If your brother cannot handle it, what makes him think you can? He is beyond reasonable. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You don't have the means to help him. I don't know a lot about it, but I have seen other posters talk about adult services through DSS. He might qualify for Disability, too. Which would help pay for a facility or group home. But these are things that DSS/adult services can tell you. This isn't something that you & your older brother have to do alone.", "NTA. He is your sibling.  You are not his parent.  Your role in life is not to be his caregiver.  Your parents were wrong to not have a plan in place for your brother before they died. And by plan I don\u2019t mean just assuming his siblings would step in.  They should have prepared for this eventuality by finding your brother a place to live where he not only gets the care he needs but he also gets to experience and enjoy life as much as he can and have as much autonomy as he can.  Being a fifth wheel in someone else\u2019s home is not comfortable, if you have any awareness at all.  It sounds like your older brothers plan is to just pass your disabled sibling back and forth between the two of you when you are too exhausted to care for him anymore.  That is not fair to any of you.  But especially not fair to your autistic sibling.\n\nPlease don\u2019t agree to this plan.  Take some time to find a great place for your sibling, close to one of your homes.  Figure out what resources you can access.  Do this for all of you.", "NTA.  Shame on him for trying to make you feel guilty by saying Max should be more valuable.  If that were the case he shouldn't be trying to get rid of Max.  And no, this was never intended to be temporary.  He wants you to take Max forever.  A group home is the answer.", "NTA - the parents suck here.", "NTA. There is Independent Living programs out there that your parents frankly should have been involved in getting Max into a long time ago. He should have a chance to grow and have a life independent of family, not be considered a burden passed back and forth", "NTA. A home for max is actually being kind.  He could get socialization that he can\u2019t get at your homes.  They would teach him things.  Allow independence.  He would probably love it.", "YTA. You can't temporarily chip in taking care of your brother it's not like he suggested u keep him. Then suggesting putting him in a home wtf so much for family.", "NTA, you can only do so much, Alex made the decision to take in Max, and he is complaining that he can't spend as much time with his family as he would like. Isn't that the same thing that will happen to you if you take Max in, I guess it's different because it is not his household. \n\nHow can he determine what your wife can do with her money does he know how your finances, that takes some nerve to tell you where to spend your money. I think it is reasonable to put Max where he can get the care and attention he needs; you are not and expert in that field and therefore would not be proficient in properly carting for him. You are not a horrible sister you are a loving sister who only wants the best for Max, and you realize your lifestyle is not the ideal situation for caring for Max. It seems he needs a lot of attention and that is something you can't fully commit to raising your family. Don't let Alex get into your head about it, you're an **AWESOME SISTER**", "No you aren't an AH. Only you and your wife know what you each can physically and emotionally. It's not up to your brother what you have to do. If you don't feel you can for any freaking reason you shouldn't. Period. Best of luck to you and tell your brother no!!!", "NTA. \n\nYour parents are the biggest assholes here for not having arrangements made in the event of their passing. \n\nYour brother is an asshole for springing this on you and just expecting you to take your brother home with you without any forethought or preparation. \n\nYour brother is NOT an asshole for not wanting your brother at a care home. Even the nice ones can be terrible. \n\nMaybe instead of financing a care home, you guys could help pay for companion care at your brothers house? That could possibly be a better compromise that works for everyone. It keeps your brother with family but takes some of the stress away.", "NTA. you know what\u2019d be worse than a facility? taking max in knowing you don\u2019t have the time and mental fortitude to properly care for him the way he needs. familial bond is meaningful, but unfortunately not strong enough to give you more hours in the day. i get alex is probably stressed, but it was unreasonable to expect such a big decision by you be made so easily and quickly.", "NTA, I am the caregiver for my 90 plus mother.  There is no end in sight caring for a 25-year-old.  It will be a commitment for the rest of your life and maybe that of your kids.  The mental and physical toll is real. I have an end in sight.  You have two small children to care for.  You were second class to Max growing up, this will also happen to your children.  You will not be able to do any activities as a family as someone will have to stay and care for Max.  Your brother found this out and wants no part of it.  Even if you agree to take Max for a short time your brother will push this on you forever and not take him back.  Research the group home, make sure that family visits him often and he will be OK.", "isnt a option to have a hired caregiver/nurse for your autistic brother (paid by you) on your brother home? \nThat way you could cooperate in having him in good care and him.being placed with \"family\".\n\nIf not, your solution is ok. It wouldnt do for him or your kids to have a resenting/exhausted caregiver just for \"saving face\".\n\nYour other brother is frustated that he cant live his own expectation and tired. I imagine that your parents told him not to leave your other brother alone and maybe he feel like he is failing to them.\n\nBut if you happen to find a good solution and visit, a noursing home is an acceptable (and maybe the only) altrrnative at the moment. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If you take Max in your brother will never take him back. Brother knows how hard this is. You and your wife are very smart to be honest about your lives and limitations. You have made your decision of how you can help. Alex can take it or leave it. He has no right to try to force you to take on this daily obligation.", "NTA. You wouldn't be taking care of him temporarily. It sounds like your brother wants you to take care of Max indefinitely. He may say it's only temporary but he'll be full of excuses for why he can't take him back.", "Caregiving is hard. Your brother made a choice to take him in and that was on him, but that doesn't mean he gets to tell you what to do. You're willing to put the funds out to put Alex somewhere safe and where he can function. Group homes are not evil places. It's tragic that your parents passed and it's tragic that your brother is unable to care for himself, but that doesn't mean you're obligated to be a primary caregiver. NTA", "NTA. You have TWO kids, he has one. Why does he think it won't be twice as hard for you? \n\nYour wife's solution is brilliant. Your brother would be far better served in a group home, he will be with people like him and not isolated, and he will likely have a better level of care than he can get at home. \n\nYour older brother just isn't thinking this through he just wants you to suffer as much as he does. Stay firm that it's either a home or he keeps on doing as he has been.", "NTA \n\nParents really need to be responsible enough to have a formal plan in place for their dependents with willing participants in the event that they themselves pass away. People pass away all the time. Parents included. It\u2019s dangerously optimistic to just assume nothing tragic will happen.\n\nWhat your brother needs is beyond your ability to give. I think your proposal is reasonable.", "NTA but neither is your brother, he is exhausted.", "ESH because people -especially those on the spectrum- often have a hard time coping with change, especially when it\u2019s a big change. Max is probably still trying to adjust to a new normal after your parents\u2019 passing. Not only does he no longer have them around to interact with, he was also uprooted from his home and thrown into the mix of his brother, and has to learn that house\u2019s rules and routines. Also, simply being on the spectrum with intellectual disabilities shouldn\u2019t take Max out of the decision making process. At the very least, he should be given the viable options and asked what he would like more so he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s being abandoned by one or both of his big siblings. \n\n\n\nNTA because caring for a dependent adult is a huge responsibility that takes up a lot of time, and is not something you should be forced into doing full-time because someone else doesn\u2019t want to. I understand that your older brother is probably getting really burned out, but that\u2019s part of the reality he accepted when he took over Max\u2019s care. If group homes are out of the question, he should look into respite care programs that could take the physical and mental weight off his shoulders and let him get breaks from caring for Max while knowing he\u2019s still being taken care of instead of trying to force Max on you when you already said no.", "Sorry but it's not the same, your parents would love to have him live with a family member.

In an ideal world no one would be stucked caring for someone full time their entire lives, maybe the government would play a part; but this is the real world and someone has to take care of Max.

I told him I emotionally ready to take him in.\n\nAlex told me he was disappointed in me and that he thought Max would be more valuable in my opinion. There was a really long argument there.\n\nI came home and told my wife all about this. She agrees with me that taking Max in wouldn't be podsible for us but she suggested we could look for a facility for him and pay for it. \n\nI offered Alex the solution I'd found.

I'm heavily considering a group home for myself once certain health issues are resolved. Just be sure to do your research.

Your younger brother needs a long-term plan for his care that will work even if you and your brother are hit by Hypothetical Busses tomorrow.\n\nHowever, at least in the US, the solution is more complex than just finding a group home.  \n\nFirst, you need to be sure that guardianship of Max is legally established.  Your parents should have done this before he turned 18, if they were managing his care properly, however, sometimes this gets overlooked, because parents just assume that they'll keep taking care of their adult child.  \n\nSecond, you need to work with an agency that provides social services for disabled adults.  Max should be eligible for a variety of government programs to help pay for a group home, day habilitation treatment, and other expenses.  These are almost always more than a family can afford to pay for. \n\nIn some states, if someone lives in a group home, it is required that they also attend some type of day treatment or work program.  This is important for socialization, so that there is more to life than just staying home, and it also provides a valuable double-check on the quality of care.  Day treatment staff can notice if things aren't right when they arrive from home, and vice-versa. \n\nThere are also services that will send a caretaker for several hours a day into a private home (such as yours or your brother's) to help with some of the care.  This may be a stopgap measure.\n\nSome group home agencies run respite homes, as well, where someone can go and stay for a few days or weeks to give a family an occasional break.  \n\nYou'll need an attorney, in Max's home community, who specializes in the legal issues facing disabled individuals, to help make sure everything is set up.
