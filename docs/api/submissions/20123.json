She chronically cheated, is an active addict, and has abusive tendencies to us both. \n\nShe was just downright awful to him most days, but often time he\u2019d indulge her for reasons I don\u2019t know understand.\n\nMy dad had been terminally ill for several months leading up to his passing, mostly sleeping or laying down. My mother would come to his house uninvited, take things here and there, make light conversation, then leave. One of those things many times was his pain meds, which led to the loss of many good days with my dad.\n\nAbout two months prior to his death, they officially divorced. They still were \u201ccordial\u201d but it was clear to everyone my mom still treated them as married and he treated her like a pest. He barred her from visiting him at the hospital, would pretend to sleep when she visited, and generally do everything to avoid her.\n\n\nNow that he\u2019s passed, I (20) have been  arranging his funeral alongside his mother and uncle. The second she learned of him passing, my mom tried to swipe his wallet and has been calling dibs on items in the house. It\u2019s made me sick to my stomach, especially with how poorly she treated him all their marriage. \n\n\nNow, my dad\u2019s family had come to the decision it was not her place to be there. It wasn\u2019t reflective of their true relationship and it was inappropriate. I agreed. When we told her, instead of reacting with her usual anger, she was plain hurt. I\u2019ve never felt such guilt in my life.\n\nI know she lost her best friend, and I never could\u2019ve imagined burying my dad without her by my side.

Respect his dying wishes. He could not have been clearer I think.\n\nDon't fall for the guilt. It's (to me) one of the most effective ways abusers keep you in control. With anger it's easy to recognize abusive behavior,  but sadness and guilt is incredibly difficult to defend yourself against.\n\nAnd your father has passed, your mother is probably looking for her next target that is going to \" indulge \" her. Don't let her make it you.\n\nCondolences. \n\nAgain.. NtA", "I understand your guilt, I'd probably feel the same way for a day...maybe two. But your mother made her own bed. A *best friend* does not steal their terminally ill friends pain medication, impacting her child's limited time with her father...a best friend doesn't come in and out of a home where a terminally ill person is sleeping/resting just to take stuff/*steal* stuff, essentially taking advantage of their vulnerable position. Nor do they *steal* their wallet the moment they die. \n\nLet's not mince words...your mother is a thief and an addict and her 'visits' were self motivated... basically like a vulture circling around an injured animal. \n\nDo you think your dad would have wanted her there? I'd use that as a guide because ultimately, what's done is done...she has acted appallingly but if she wants to pay her final respects...there's probably no harm in that at this point.", "NTA\n\nNormally I like to err on the side of saying that everyone, even an ex, deserves to be able to come to a funeral service to say goodbye.  \n\nBut in this case, your mother sounds like a toxic person who would not be there for the right reasons and would likely cause problems your family and your dad's family don't need at this time. \n\nMy condolences on the loss of your father.", "NTA. She didn't act like a friend should, let alone a spouse. She doesn't deserve to be there.", "NTA  \nSounds like your dad didn't want her around at the end (don't blame him either), so he probably wouldn't have wanted her at the funeral.   \nShe stole from him... abused him? Man, from what you're saying, she really shouldn't be there. She can cry her boohoo tears, but she brought it on herself. You don't need to feel guilty, though I know you can't really choose how you feel.   \nBe wary also. She's probably going to pick a new target soon, and that target will be you if you show her any weakness.", "Let me clarify: she is attending the wake, she is simply not invited to stand with us for the calling hours.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, OP.\n\nYour father had his say in this when he chose to finalise the divorce and barred her from visiting the hospital as two of his final acts.\n\nThis is about him, not about assuaging any guilt or hurt she feels at being left out.", "NTA\n\nRespect your father's wishes. For man in his death bed to still go through the trouble of divorcing your mother should  tell you everything you need to know.\n\nFrankly, the other things she's done make me sick. How anyone could do that to someone is beyond me.\n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your father.", "NTA It's not your guilt to carry. And it was decided by your dad's mother and brother", "You\u2019re clearly not the asshole here. But I wonder if someday you might not regret not letting her come. If nothing else, your relationship with her will never be the same. Be prepared to answer every single person as to \u201cwhere is Mom?\u201d\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve likely been to more funerals than you (due to age), and let me tell you: There are always people there who have no business being there. Some are crying crocodile tears. Some are oblivious to the feelings of other attendees. But as a rule, people tend to behave themselves (unless there\u2019s alcohol).", "NTA but make sure the house is locked and maybe put some cameras up before the memorial.", "NTA. No offense to addicts but she\u2019s an addict and they\u2019re crafty cunning animals. She knew she could keep a thread and hook stuck in you by playing the hurt card. She feels nothing for your family. Completely disown her. \n\nMight be cold but that\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ll ever get. I\u2019ve known a lot of addicts. If they stay clean they\u2019re people. If not, they\u2019re not, they\u2019re just the drug walking around.", "NTA she swiped his wallet and called dibs on his household items, why was she even allowed in the house? Awful people have a tendency to make you feel like a bad person when you call them out on their shit.", "NTA.  Your mother has brought this all upon by herself.
