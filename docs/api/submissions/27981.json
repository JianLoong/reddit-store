We hit it off and officially got together the summer before senior year. It was clear from the beginning that my presence threatened my SIL (f 21), let\u2019s call her Sarah. We\u2019re pretty similar (both artsy, both chronically ill, both quiet and reserved). She often tries to one up me when my chronic illness flares up by telling everyone her\u2019s is flaring up and it\u2019s worse than mine. I have gone on vacation with them a couple of times and this happened several times over the couple week long vacations. It never bothered me as I am quite comfortable with myself and my illness, and I know that she was probably a bit jealous of the fact that her brother was finding success romantically and she wasn\u2019t.\n\nSarah also has an uncomfortable, Freudian infatuation with James. She often makes inappropriate comments about his genitals (and I mean OFTEN. We live out of town and almost every time we visit she brings up James\u2019 junk). \n\nThis came to a culmination a few weeks ago when my SIL bought a white/beige floor length dress for our wedding in two months. The dress is beige with white flowers all over it to the point of it being mostly white. It literally looks like a wedding dress. My sister who works as a bridal boutique says she sells a dress that looks exactly like the one Sarah bought. Now, it is worth noting that I am wearing a black dress, but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate for her to wear a wedding dress to her brother\u2019s wedding. When she sent James a photo of the dress asking if it was alright, I expressed my discomfort with it and James, being the absolutely incredible man he is, stood up for me and told Sarah that it was inappropriate. She thought he was joking and after quite a bit of back and forth, the conversation ended with James putting his foot down and saying Sarah was not welcome at our wedding if she was going to wear this dress and Sarah saying that James was \u201cno longer her brother\u201d and he was not to call or text her again. About 20 minutes after she said this, she left him an emphatic voicemail saying the same stuff.\n\nNow, today we went tux shopping for James and he invited his mom, and Sarah ended up tagging along. She acted as though nothing had happened but when my mom asked if Sarah had found a dress yet and she said yes, implying that she had not returned the dress to get something else.\n\nNow, under normal circumstances, I don\u2019t think anyone would think i am TA but does that change because I\u2019m wearing black?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696114004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wkdwa/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_wear_a_white_dress_to/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
