You still  shouldn't have thrown out the pizza.  But mom is a 100% an Ahole", "holy shit you really do remind me of my situation. i hope you don\u2019t get discouraged by reddit\u2014your mom is definitely on the wrong, and i can be hard to be misunderstood when you\u2019ve faced so much manipulation and gaslighting since a young age. i also hope you know that you can always heal from your family dysfunctions.", "You're right; I don't understand. But it's probably like you said. I am living this, so a description of one night doesn't really show you what my life is like. It's just been a lot for me. Honestly though, even with so many people saying such mean things about me, just typing out what happened and knowing other people read it makes me feel a little better. It's like screaming into a forest, I guess. So thanks for that.", "That was the only explanation I could think of for why that information would be important.", "I guess I just don't understand. Maybe it's one of those adult relationship things my dad insists I can't understand until I'm older. To me, if you are mean to someone in your family it shouldn't matter whether they are your stepson or not. You all seem to know something I don't.", "I appreciate it \u2764", "Dude, this parent threw a kid under the bus and you\u2019re just helping with the emotional abuse. Stop it.", "Why do we have to be her excuse? I don't want to be used like that.", "Calm down, i could understand if mom. Actually has a habit of doing this to OP's brother, and making him feel bad often (if only when he cooks she just doesn't like his cooking) then i understand why they're upset. Reoccurring they don't want to be one of their mothers outs.", "She\u2019s not in charge\u2026 yet it\u2019s her fault her mom bought pizza to hurt her step-brother\u2019s feelings. Make it make sense.", "Let me put it this way. In your comments you mentioned that she treats him differently and why, that's important enough for you to be upset over right? \n\nThat little snippet of information puts a whole different light on the situation and is important to tell people. If it's the reason you're upset then it's important to include it because it gives context. \n\nYour post makes it seems like you're upset over a single lie that could easily be explained, but the added context of \"He's not her son and she treats him differently\", gives her lie less credibility and let's us understand where all this anger from you is coming from. \n\nYou also have a single example of a spelling bee, this is also important because it shows a pattern of behavior and shows us that you're not going bananas over a one time incident. So it's important to give us several examples if this is a regular behavior.", "No you misunderstood me. You're right, blood or not it's all about respect in the end. However, the stepparent/child relationship is historically disastrous in many cases so the context helps to explain any underlying issues your mom may have with your brother.", "There is just much higher chance that she was being mean and not just buying food without any second thought if that was her stepson. I thought it was her son and she didn't do anything bad, just wanted to eat, I only realized it might have been on purpose after i read it was her stepson hence more chance she dislikes him and is an asshole.  Does it make sense to you this way? For me, it's about \"was she really mean or not\".", "Dude i was asking for other examples of her doing this, he did give an example in another  comment, Op did not post enough info in my opinion and everyone was ragging on him, after looking for other info i changed my mind, at the end of this thread i literally said i believed him, just stop", "My point is, i think it would be WAY MORE MEAN to say to her son \"i HATE your cooking and I'd rather get other food,\" then saying \"the kids were hungry rn, and food will be done in an hour\" if anything which sounds more mean to you, thats why i asked if its only food related.\n\nYou also didn't answer why you think she's purposely doing this.", "Okay, you're right. I guess because I'm just so used to everything I didn't realize I would need to explain how I knew she was lying. For me it's obvious.", "You're right. I did misunderstand you. I am feeling very emotional about everything. That might be part of the reason I jumped to the wrong conclusion about what you meant. The truth is, someone gave me good advice to tell my mom how I feel when I get home today in a respectful manner. They made a good case and I am trying to keep reminding myself why that is a good idea. Deep down though, all I want to do when I get home is yell \"fuck you and all your lies, you liar\" at her over and over, even though I obviously can't do that. Maybe I should just go to a friend's house and avoid her.", "If she just wanted to eat, she wouldn't have lied.", "He's not her son. He's just our brother. I don't want to be a part of anyone's lie. I don't care what her reason is.", "Letting people know she had a pattern of this sort of behavior with your brother let\u2019s people understand where you\u2019re coming from. If she is constantly putting you against him or using you as an excuse to be mean to him that is VASTLY different than you just flipping out and throwing the pizza away. I would add it as an edit so people get a clear picture of what\u2019s happening.", ">I didn't care that she was hungry because she's a mean person, so maybe being hungry for a bit will be good for her\n\nwell, after you said that... it's not much different from \"fuck you you liar\". Same level of disrespect (well, unless you are oversensitive to profanity). You already said the worst, you can either go on the same way or try to talk to her in a human way. It still bothers me that someone can hate their mom that much, even if she does that on purpose it's not that big a deal, you are a big boy now and you will not miss any spelling bees anymore, you have your own relationship with your brother now.", "Definitely keep the tone respectful, you have to give it to get it in return. But you should also be in the right state of mind to talk to her and emotional wreck isn't it. If you need space, take some just don't be mean in the process. That would make you a hypocrite and kill any righteousness you have rn. And look, I know this is a lot for you, you're a teenager (I'm guessing) and to be in this position is fucked up. Try and handle it the best way you can and with some grace. That's really much more for your benefit than hers.", "Don't see any lie, you kids did want a pizza. I do understand that there's context and details that you didn't describe in the post, but to the outsiders eye it looks like your dad is making mom the bad guy on purpose.\nJust saying, I could very well bring a pizza to my mom's house as my contribution even knowing that she was cooking. And mom would never see it as disrespect because we love each other and have a great relationship. When the relationship is great, things like bringing pizza don't matter at all. We'd eat both the pizza and the dinner.\n\nSo you really need to provide more context to help us understand.", "So by that logic you are OK by her being mean, as long as you're not included. \n\nYou'd prefer her to say she doesn't like his cooking. \n\nAgain tho you haven't answered if this is the only stuff that tends to happen related with food. \n\n If it's not only food related and she just seems like she dislikes your brother. She's an Ahole.\n\n If she doesn't like his cooking and that's the only reason she does some of this.\n\n I honestly can't think of a way to get out of eating someone's food that you don't like, especially family.\n\n Also my ad I still don't understand what MEAN is in this scenario.", "You keep stating this.\n\nYou were NOT \u201cblamed\u201d and not \u201cpart of a lie\u201d.\n\nHow do you know she didn\u2019t just forget? How do you know she didn\u2019t think dinner was for hours yet? You don\u2019t know any of that.\n\nShe was asked why she brought pizza home. She responded, \u201cI asked the kids and they were hungry.\u201d That isn\u2019t blaming you. That is explains how it happened. Stop trying to be a victim when you clearly were not.", "It's a big deal to me.", "No, she offered us pizza. That's not at all the same as us asking for pizza. So it's a lie. My dad couldn't make her something that she is. She knew what she did was wrong, so she tried to blame us. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of her. I know I should just keep calm and tell her how I feel, but I'm worried I'll be so angry I'll tell her what I really think of her, which is that she's a pathetic person who lies to make people feel bad. I know I can't say that because there will be consequences, but I'm so angry I'm scared I will say it anyway.", "She doesn't like him because they aren't related. She says I'm crazy and she loves us all the same, but she's a liar. I'm sick of the lies. Sometimes I love my mom a lot, but when she lies to me I feel so much hate for her. It's like she isn't my mom anymore, but a different person who is just a liar and nothing else. Like the Other Mother from Coraline or something. But this is real life, and there is only one version of my mom, and she is the person who lies to and about me. I know she's going to want me to apologize to her after school, but all I want to do is say whatever I think will hurt her the most so maybe she finally understands how her lies make me feel. I want to tell her I hate her, even though I don't really.", "Do you think that by hating her you can make her love your older brother ? The answer is no, you can't. You live your brother. That is great! So, she didn't turn you against him, do you realize that lots of parents turn their kids against the people they don't like?\nIf there's more context explaining the level of drama, people have to know the context (like yes, she did try to turn you against your brother etc) to make a fair jugement. We often have our own families in mind, and in our families a dinner may not be a big deal because we have other important ways to bond", "Look, you wrote that she said you wanted it. You didn't write she said you asked for it. Do you see the difference? \n\"I bought it because we all were hungry including kids\" and \"I only bought it because they asked me\" are two very different things", "Don't harass your mother please. This is making me feel worried for her tbh.", "I\u2019m sorry your mom is dishonest. It sucks when we can\u2019t trust the adults who are closest to us. If you just say mean things, she\u2019s going to assume you\u2019re being an irrational child. If you calmly tell her something like, \u201cI felt like you were blaming me for messing up my brother\u2019s dinner, when I only said yes to pizza because you offered. It seems like you don\u2019t like my brother, and that bothers me\u201d then she\u2019ll have to respond to you.", "Im sorry, i definitely wouldn't say anything more mean to your mom. I understand, im 20 and my mom is horrible, but you might regret it. I told my mom she's a horrible mother, i regret that, not because i don't believe it but because of how she will use it as ammo for the rest of your life. \"Oh ik im such a bad mother etc\"\n\nI wanted to run away or worse so my mom would see her actions, when i got a little older i realized she wouldn't ever see it my way. Even if i ran away she'd make an excuse as to why it wasn't her fault.\n\n Even tho i still haven't read anything other then the food that shows her lying/being rude, i believe you because again I've had a bad mom.\n\nLet your brother know you love him, as long as he knows what mom says has nothing to do with you, and i know you wont want to hear it but you're  not gonna help the situation with your brother by getting the fam mad at you. \n\nOther then that i wish you luck, im sorry the comments are beating you to a pulp, i think most of us are stuck om wasting food that you didn't buy, (your still the Ahole for that) but i also understand why you did it.", "Based on this comment, I think you should give therapy a shot. You have a lot of hate.", "I don't hate my mom. I just hate the things she does.", "It's a lie in spirit even if you use backwards logic to say technically what she said could mean something else. She lied to blame me for something she did, and I'm over it. I don't care anymore about being level headed or the bigger person or anything. Tonight I'm going to tell her how I really feel, that I think she's disgusting and pathetic and I don't love her. I'm going to tell her all the things she did to try and make us love her the most made me not love her at all.", "Maybe. But what if her response is just to lie more? Then what will have been the point?", "Yeah, I know I shouldn't say anything else mean to her, but I feel like I have to. I have so much anger in my heart and feel like I will explode from it. I feel like I have to tell her I hate her so she understands how it feels to have a member of your family treat you bad. Then maybe she won't want to treat any members of our family poorly anymore."]}
