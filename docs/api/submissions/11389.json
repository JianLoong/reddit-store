OP and their biological siblings have been tricked by their mom before into being part of the mom\u2019s calculated efforts to exclude or abuse her stepson/ OP\u2019s brother.\n\nOP, I think in the comments you\u2019re learning a very hard lesson right now about how your mom\u2019s behaviour towards your brother is emotionally abusive, and maybe you\u2019re also realizing why these details you shared in the comments are important for us who are reading your story to understand exactly what happened.\n\nJust to explain a little more why these details are important - they explain that your reaction isn\u2019t actually just to this one event. You\u2019re reacting to all the times you\u2019ve seen your mom treat your brother poorly, and also the other time (or times) she has tricked you into being part of the mean stuff she is doing to hurt your brother\u2019s feelings on purpose. These details also show all of us who are reading your story a possible (and likely) reason as to why your mom is acting the way she is, even though she definitely shouldn\u2019t be. When you say your mom is being mean to her stepson, and using her biological kids to do it, we at home understand what your mom is doing, and why this specific thing she did is so cruel.\n\nHere is an example of why the details are important: in my example we have someone named Alice, who has four cats. Alice is always nice to three of the cats, but really mean to the fourth cat. That\u2019s a weird thing to do, and it makes no sense why someone would be good to three cats and mean to the fourth when they\u2019re all the same. So people will wonder why is Alice nice to three cats but not the fourth. People will think maybe it\u2019s an accident. But if we learn that the three cats which Alice is nice to are orange, and the one cat Alice is mean to is grey, we now have a possible reason to understand why Alice is mean to that fourth cat. We know it\u2019s probably not an accident or a coincidence, and we know it\u2019s never the cat\u2019s fault for being grey. Alice shouldn\u2019t be mean to any cats, but the fact that she\u2019s mean to the grey one and not the orange ones is important. Or explains why she was mean to only one, even though she shouldn\u2019t be. Now those of us who are reading my example can understand just how mean it was of Alice. If we know Alice does this a lot, and not just one time, then we can also understand why a more severe reaction to Alice being mean may occur.\n\nObviously you guys aren\u2019t cats, it\u2019s just an example I wanted to share after seeing some of your comments where you didn\u2019t know why your mom not being biologically related to your brother would be important for us to understand. I hope this explains a little why lots of people have told you it\u2019s an important detail for us to know before we can judge if you\u2019re TA or not. If we understand that your mom is treating one of her kids differently from the rest, and the one she is treating differently is her stepson, and that this stuff has happened more than once, we get a better idea of why you were so mad. You are right when you say that people should treat their kids with love, compassion, and respect whether they\u2019re biologically related or not. The problem is, lots of times parents are cruel or abusive to kids that are not biologically theirs, just because the kids aren\u2019t biologically theirs. I, and some other commenters, think this is what is happening here.\n\nIf you edit your post and tell people that your brother isn\u2019t biologically related to your mom, and that your mom has done this sort of stuff before, like that time you told us about, where she offered to take you to the movies without telling you that it would be at the same time as your brother\u2019s school event which he had invited you to (and that your mom didn\u2019t tell you was happening) then I think we will understand better why you are so upset with your mom, and why what she did was so wrong it made you angry enough to throw away the pizzas. I\u2019m not saying wasting food is good, and you probably could have put them in the fridge for later, but I get why you did what you did.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m proud of you for being a good sibling to your brother and looking out for him! But it isn\u2019t your job to protect your big brother, thats what your dad should be doing. I think you need to have a talk with your dad about how what your mom is doing is making you feel. If your dad won\u2019t help your brother, is there someone who your brother can talk to at school maybe? Is there someone you can talk to? I think that would be a good idea.", "YTA oh my gosh the audacity", ">She said the pizza was hot and ready,\n\n\nOh the things people do to avoid eating Little Caesar's...\n\nYTA", "Geez, I want kids and them I read something like that and I'm like, maaaybe not. Yta", ">I said I didn't care that she was hungry because she's a mean person, so maybe being hungry for a bit will be good for her. She left and didn't come back until after dinner.\n\nWhere did OP learn it from though? This is so disturbing to read and I wonder if OP's used to speaking to their parent in that way, maybe that's the way they (the kids) are spoken to often as well. Or maybe that's how the father speaks to the mother?", "His mom wasted money because she bought the pizza when she knew it wasn\u2019t needed in the first place. Should he have thrown it away when it could have gone into the fridge when cold instead? No but he\u2019s not more of an ass than her in my opinion.", "I appreciate this comment because it underscores the point that OP is still a KID. Not to excuse the behavior, but I do suspect OP is reacting to a certain amount of turmoil in the house.", "OP mentioned in the comments that the brother is a step brother, not their mom\u2019s biological kid, the mom frequently emotionally abuses her biological kids by weaponizing them in her abuse of her stepson, and that\u2019s how OP knew it was intentional - because they live in this terrible dynamic every day.", "Buying extra food makes someone as much/more of an ass than throwing away someone's food?  How?", "I\u2019m not going to speculate fully because this is a very limited snapshot, but just because the dad said he told the mom that there were dinner plans doesn\u2019t mean that he actually did say that. It\u2019s not uncommon for toxic people to pretend like they\u2019ve passed along information to make someone else look bad. \n\nWe have no context and can\u2019t really know if that\u2019s more likely, or if the mom being wasteful is more likely. But it seems like this family doesn\u2019t have great conflict management skills, based on the post.", "Did she actually \"blame\" them, or is that just OP's emotions getting the better of them?  Considering OP's nutty behavior, I'm guessing the latter.", "Well, this definitely changes things. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve loved to have you as a sibling. I also grew up in a toxic household and no one ever stood up for me like what you did for your brother. Your mom does sound manipulative and mean and I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re having to deal with it.", "If you haven\u2019t, talk to your father about this. Try to recall all the instances where she\u2019s done something similar or was unkind to your brother. You can also explain why you did what you did to your younger siblings so that they understand the situation for what it is.", "Considering this happened while the parents were fighting I suspect this is normal shitting behavior for the Mom.", "What is written here is that the mom lied in order to drive a wedge between her children and her stepson and hurt her stepson. Pizza is temporary, child abuse is forever.", "That's not how this works, teenagers don't get to make these choices because they feel like it.", "The pizza wasn't for OP, it was for the family", "LOL this isn't a Christmas gift or something, this is a meal bought for the family.  If I buy pizza for my family and my son walked over and took a plate full and walked over to the trash and threw it straight away, he would be rightfully in trouble. Of course the mother is an AH, but most def OP also is.", "You seem to be creating a movie from 3 short and unhinged paragraphs, and also projecting yourself into this. Again, therapy is great, maybe go there to work out you abuse issues instead of trying to fight with people on Reddit.", "They do when their Mom's an AH.", "No it wasn't, it was to upset the brother.", "This wasn't a meal for the family, this was a prop for upsetting family.", "Sorry 3 paragraphs was too long for you to keep track, I guess. \n\nTherapy is indeed great, don\u2019t try to use it as a weapon though.", "People are responding based on limited info & are having to make assumptions. That\u2019s why you\u2019re getting such negative feedback that seems unfair.\n\nIf you gave some backstory about how your mother regularly mistreats your stepbrother, that would provide a better understanding about why you acted as you did. \n\nA lot of commenters don\u2019t see beyond the fact that you dramatically threw out food. On its own, that would be childish and wasteful behavior. But you were reacting to your mother\u2019s behavior.\n\nShe was deliberately being unkind to your stepbrother and was manipulating the situation (using you and your younger siblings) to do so. You showed that you rejected this by throwing out the food in question. \n\nWhile I think actually throwing out food may be taking things too far, it\u2019s to your credit that you see what your mother is doing and that you stand against it. \n\nGoing forward, I\u2019d suggest expressing yourself verbally rather than through actions.\n\nNTA", "Mom is an asshole but food waste is still wrong and not up to OP. I wouldn't ever buy them any treats ever again if my kid just decided to throw freshly made and bought food in the trash.", "What makes you think that?", "Sure, still wasn\u2019t OP\u2019s to throw away.", "What is the lie? \n\nDid you ask if your brother was cooking?", "\"If my kid just decided\"\nAs though there was nothing else going on and they did it out of nowhere. Ya'll are acting like the pizza trashing was done in a vacuum. I think the OP did a great job of demonstrating that their brother's feelings were more important than having pizza", "Reading the post...", "She wants to weaponize OP this is what she gets.", "If she forgot, she would have said she forgot, instead of of saying the kids wanted pizza. There is a difference. Also kids are allowed to have feelings, if you read this is  a reoccurring thing, look through comments and you'll get info thats adds that the mom does this alot. \n\nThey aren't playing victim, asking not to be included in the excuse as to why she got pizza is reasonable. Honestly, i still think throwing it away was bad, but being upset that they were basically being brought up in an excuse as their parents bickered, thats UNDERSTANDABLE.\n\nThe fact that this kid see's how mom is treating their brothe, is so mature, that they understand and feel bad for their brother. Thats NOT A VICTIM.", "It was not done in a vacuum but the trashing and the comments weren't appropriate. OP is a brat, mom is an asshole. Kid shouldn't get privileges like takeaway anymore.", "If one person is an Ah and you respond in an AH way there are now two AHs.", "Next time you want a treat, I hope she tells you that being a wittle hungry is good for you too.", "I think the Mom deserves more consequences than the OP.", "There is no justified AH selection so I make do with what I have."]}
