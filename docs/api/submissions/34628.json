She is also likely paying for the gas there and back, and maybe more while she has fil. Maybe offer some gas money to help there too.

Maybe as a empathetic relative you can turn the heating down a bit? Or maybe put a thin sweater on your kid? I know you said your kid doesn't wanna put on anything but this is as good a time to teach him that he cannot just roam around without clothes all the time?

Maybe if she chased her daughter around the  house with a jumper or sweater your niece will warm up enough to not need the extra layers. If your husband thinks your children can wear a jumper, then that argument definitely applies to the person who keeps their heat low.\n\nIf you lower your heat and have to struggle to get your child to wear a jumper, how is that different from SIL getting her child to wear a jumper?   Your husband's logic is flawed. Your SIL is making her problem your problem and that is not the solution.  I guess maybe don't babysit anymore if it causes issues like this?   Then her daughter will forget about your warm house and start wearing all her layers again.  \n\nIf your husband feels that bad about it, maybe if your finances allow for it, he could give his sister some money for her heat for a couple of months.
