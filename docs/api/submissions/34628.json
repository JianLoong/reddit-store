Your husband's logic is flawed. Your SIL is making her problem your problem and that is not the solution.  I guess maybe don't babysit anymore if it causes issues like this?   Then her daughter will forget about your warm house and start wearing all her layers again.  \n\nIf your husband feels that bad about it, maybe if your finances allow for it, he could give his sister some money for her heat for a couple of months.

You're doing her a favor and she should be appreciative of that, not making demands about what you do in your own home.", "Why are people so demanding of others???\n\nMy mother keeps a cold house I visit with sweaters, jackets, toque. I don\u2019t comment because she pays the bills not I.\n\nSIL needs to teach their kids about \u201cdifferent house different rules\u201d.\n\nShe\u2019s getting free childcare\u2026 otherwise charge her for your time then\u2026 keep the house like an icebox so mommy can avoid fighting with a child. What\u2019s next\u2026 you cant keep the lights on, food in the cupboards, pets.., etc.", "Does your son have a sensory processing disorder?  Is the temperature one the rest of your family finds comfortable?   It does seem to be a bit like he is ruling the roost.  That said your SIL also needs not let Ava do it either.  I think your husband has a point and an attempt to make peace with a middle ground.  I am between N A H and E S H.", "ESH, maybe it\u2019s time for your husband to step up and start providing care for his father", "ESH - why are we letting children dictate the temperature of our homes? What happens when the kids realize life won\u2019t always bend to their every whim? What happens when they go to school have to learn to share space with 25 other kids?", "Nta sucks they can\u2019t have heat but just bc they can\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t. Your house, your rules especially when regarding the temperature", "NTA\n\nThere are going to be a lot of hard conversations for a mother to give her daughter in her lifetime. If she can't sit her down and tell her that she can't afford to turn on the heater, which should be a two minute talk at most, then motherhood is going to be a very hard time for your SIL. Instead, she is trying to get you to turn off your heat, which is beyond ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for other peoples circumstances. I sympathize with your sister in law, but asking you all to freeze because she is is wildly unreasonable.", "NTA and I would offer to stop babysitting since it's causing such issues. I'm assuming you're doing everything OP and your husband is \"working\" (quotations because what you're doing is hard work). He can stay in his lane.", "NTA. You just keep your house at a different temperature because thats how you and your family like it. You shouldn't have to change it because of someone's financial struggle.  If the (im assuming) baby doesn't want to wear a jumper, then don't force it!", "Your SIL could explain to her child \"Auntie keeps her house warmer we do not. Put on layers if you are cold.\" No need to be embarrassed or make this a big issue for OP. SIL needs to parent her child. OP is helping with free childcare.  NTA.", "My son won\u2019t wear clothes around the house either so we have a bunch of blankets and he just pulls one on when he gets cold.", "NTA. Children learn to learn that different households have different rules and expectations. It's awful your SIL is struggling to heat her hone. If you're feeling generous make a payment towards her heating bill.", "NTA. I am part polar bear so I melt if the temp gets too high, but when people come to my house they can put on more clothes or I always have blankets everywhere. It's not your fault that she keeps her house colder. They should just explain to Ava that different people keep their house different temps and that wearing layers isn't hard. Keeping my house cold is only cost effective in the Winter, it's murder on my electric bill in the Summer.", "Nta: i don't even begin to understand why anyone thinks other people's homes are all the same temp.\nWe have, however, told my parents that they can't 'cook' the personal support workers. The PSWs are smaand wear light material scrubs. But if my kid said 'so and so's house is warmer' i would be 'nice for them'", "NTA.  It\u2019s your house, you do what you want.", "NTA. My house, my heat.", "NTA\n\nIt is not reasonable for someone to not use heat in the winter because they don't heat their own home anymore than it would be reasonable to request someone not to use A/C in the summer.\n\nWhile SIL is not being a choosing beggar since child care is because of medical issues for OP's husband's father, it still is not a reasonable request.", "NTA. Your house your rules.", "NTA.  Tell her this is a golden opportunity to teach her daughter that life doesn't always accommodate your wants.\n\nAlso a golden opportunity to teach her daughter that No means No.  You get what you get, don't throw a fit.", "NTA but your sister was coming from a place of pain and embarrassment when she asked you.", "NTA\nChildren can easily learn that different houses have different rules. You shouldn't have to change your way of life to match hers.", "NTA. I\u2019m a single mom who struggled with bills when my child was little. I would\u2019ve let her go without layers and get cold to experience the natural consequences.", "You are NTA for having your heat on.   You are not the NTA for not wanting to be a super cold place.  \n\nYou are, however, being insensitive and rude to your SIL.   Your SIL is living in poverty!   \n\nIn this stressful situation she is the one taking your FIL to his appointments, not you and not your husband.   NOT YOUR HUSBAND.   \n\nA compromise is reasonable.   Your child can learn to wear a jumper or be cold.   And you can pay for your SIL to have heat!   You can pay for your SIL who is caring for your FIL to have heat.", "NTA\n\nSiL can find other child care. She doesn't have a say in how you keep your home warm. I could see if you were FREEZING her kid, making it risky.", "NTA\n\nAva is 4. Sweetie, aunt likes to keep her home very warm. We don't do that because it is not comfortable for everyone in this house. If you feel cold, I can help you put in layers and snuggle with you to make sure you are comfy.\n\nSee, no need to explain that they are having trouble paying the bills. SIL and Ava will survive. No egos will be hurt.", "NTA. You can't make demands of someone else's house.\n\nI have family in the UK and I'm very aware of the cost of living crisis (and how bad it was last winter -- so many people keeping heating at 15-16C ALL DAY!) It sucks, and the government was absolute shit at helping people. Plus, there's also an insulation and damp crisis in UK housing so many homes are truly miserable. A baby died because of mold in a public housing flat last year and it was front page news. \n\nBut this isn't how to handle it. Even if you weren't doing her a favor -- it's your house! She can't make you and a toddler be cold so she can avoid uncomfortable conversations about the heating bill.", "NTA. Internal temp of your home is kind of your preference. Like what time you eat dinner or what kind of car you drive. SIL needs to back off and be grateful for the free childcare.", "NTA.  Sorry, but SIL doesn't get to dictate how you run your household, end of story.  If your husband is so concerned about his sister's finances, let him loan her money to turn her heat on.  Or buy her a space heater.", "Aside from that, constantly turning your heat on and off is REALLY hard on your HVAC. It's way harder to heat a cold house than it is to keep a warm house warm.", "I love how we're all sitting here chastising the SIL for not making her daughter keep her layers on but OP is allowed to not force her kid to put layers on, too.\n\nThis is such a double standard here.", "He\u2019s probably working?", "Ooh, I missed that the kiddo in question is 1! NT", "Imagine if she sends the kid to daycare and they also warm the place more than she does. Does she expect they will just make it colder and make a dozen or more kids bundle up?", "She is not a freeloader. She is driving OP's sick Father in Law to appointments.", "Wow you and your upvoters are cold - pun intended. Sil isn't out partying while op is minding niece. She's  taking care of FIL which helps out op and her husband too (why doesn't ops husband take on some of thus duty???).\n\nIf I heard my family was struggling so much they had to go without a baduc neccesity like heat in winter my mind wouldn't go to \"not my problem\". How can husband and op be so blasee about this?? They are shitty and so is your mentality. People on here are disgusting", "That's what I'm wondering.  And also, why is the temperature set based on the fact that they can't get a one year old to wear enough clothes?  Is that normal in households?", "He's 1yo.", "Exactly. What adult can\u2019t explain to her own daughter that their house doesn\u2019t have what other houses have. It\u2019s easier for sil to have *everyone* live like she does than to parent her own kid. \n\nOp can probably get her youngest to wear a jumper , albeit with effort and a bit of struggle. But *she* doesn\u2019t need to put that extra effort and struggle into something . Sil needs to learn she can\u2019t expect people to change their lifestyles to suit her kid. She should learn how to parent her kid. It will be a good lesson for her kid to learn .", "How long will we allow parents to not parent their kids by demanding others do things their way? Entitlement is real.", "The kid doesn\u2019t have cancer. The father in law does.", "You suck at reading", "If she was actually embarrassed, she wouldn't have mentioned she doesn't heat her home.", "This seems to be the standard advice for British gas central heating. You turn the heating on and off. it's one reason they don't understand heat pumps, where you just adjust the temperature and the system turns on and off as needed.", "I mean... it's not \"hard\" on it, it's just inefficient. It constantly turns on and off normally just to maintain steady temperature.", "That's... just not true. Your furnace works just as hard to heat a cold house as it does a warm house - it just runs longer to heat a cold house. Your thermostat can't tell your HVAC system to heat or cool \"just a little bit\", it can only call for heat, cooling, or ventilation (some fancier setups have more options such as auxiliary heat, but that's still not setting the intensity of anything). It controls the amount of heating and cooling that goes on by controlling the amount of time the heater or A/C runs for.", "I agree. We all were at bils house fir xmas. All Complained it was too cold. Hey George, its kinda cold could you turn up the heat a bit?  (His wife wearing snow pants to cook). He said OK! \ud83d\ude0a Ill turn it UP to SIXTY THREE.  \ud83e\udd76\ud83e\udd76\ud83e\udd76\ud83e\udd76", "On the hunt for rage responses heh? OP is ok with putting the heat on for her family. Why would she do otherwise? For someone else to feel okay about not having the heat on?", "Drat, can you edit in reddit? Now I'm feeling old and out of it. Was trying to say NTA regardless, but for sure in trying to get a 1 year old to wear a sweatshirt!", "I don't think they'll warm it up to a point where it's enough to just wear a t shirt. Keeping your place that warm is quite wasteful unless you produce the energy that takes yourself. \nThough I think OP needs to turn the heater down she's NTA for not turning it off while babysitting for free.", "It's her father & her choice. OP shouldn't have to change the way she acts in her home because an adult child (SIL) is taking care of their parent. If you said the husband should take 50/50 of the chore, I would agree with you. But then there would be no reason to take care of the child that 50% of the time because then OP is doing double what is assumed of her.", "The oil-filled ones are pretty good, they don't draw nearly as much as a quartz heater, and as a bonus are much safer. They aren't going to warm a space from near freezing, but they are perfect for boosting a single room a few degrees.", "He will get over it.", "See the 3 dots next to the reply arrow? Click there and you'll get a menu that includes edit", "And it\u2019s OP\u2019s husband\u2019s dad. Why isn\u2019t he the one driving his dad?", "Sorry yes, I left out the word \u2018husband\u2019s\u2019!", "The child is not complaining that OP\u2019s house is too warm. The child complains that her own house is too cold", "I'm an adult who runs colder than the rest of my household and keeps a space heater under my desk. It definitely makes it harder to leave the desk and go elsewhere in the house when I know I'll freeze as soon as I leave my island of warmth.\n\nFlip it around: if your bedroom was 65 and the rest of the house was 75, do you think you'd be inclined to spend more time in your bedroom where you're comfortable?
