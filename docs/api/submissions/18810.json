Maybe she'd like to see this concert while everything else on the night is good. Like if there was a sequel to one of your favourite films, would you want to watch it on some random occasion or during your movie night when you have all the good stuff? Could be how she feels about this concert.\n\nYou'll have the film you choose before or after anyway.\n\nMaybe some time there will be a TV series you want to watch, you want to see if you can get her into it, and she'll remember, \"That's not a movie.\"", "YTA.  Geez, do you want to break up and just don't have the balls?  Why on earth would you argue about the technicalities of a movie vs. a concert?", "Aw that poor girl :( YTA and I doubt she\u2019ll actively want to choose movies or participate in movie nights more", "NTA. I agree. That's not a movie. I would just do it anyways though since it's what she wants to watch and you two still get to spend time together.", "NTA.  Being uninterested in the concert is not the same as \"looking down upon\" it. Like you, I prefer movies with plots, action, excitement, etc. Concerts bore me to death - not what you said, it is simply my different choice.\n\nMy husband loves Tom Cruise movies, he watches them repeatedly whenever there isn't something else he's interested in.  I personally deeply dislike watching Tom Cruise. Yes, he's handsome, does cool stunts, is a good actor, but I just don't care for his acting. I did like Risky Business ;-)\n\nIt's a running joke between us now. I ask what he's watching, he tells me, I roll my eyes, we laugh, then I kiss him on the head and *leave the room*.", "NAH my fellow redditor, \"technicalities\". Watch the thing, make her happy and make your life easier then it will be if you decide that this hill will be the one you will defend till you die. \nPut you best nike shoes and just do it.", "Genuine question for those saying a this concert IS a movie. Does porn then count? \nPersonally, for me, ESH not in a big way but you both seem too stubborn to compromise, ANY. She won't watch another night. You won't let this one slide and then say I don't want to do that again for movie night. Like this isn't hard for either of you.\n\nEdit:spelling", "ESH. \n\nHer for choosing a non-movie for movie night. Personally, I think it is the same as if you had a night per week where you would go out to a restaurant for supper, and she decided the hot dog stand was the same thing.\n\nYou for not letting it go and making the compromise. I realize that you had mentally prepared for something with a plot, but sometimes we all have to make adjustments to our preferences in a relationship. Maybe suggest the concert video, followed by a movie?", "NAH. I agree with you. A recording of a concert is not a movie. It\u2019s a concert. A concert you\u2019re watching on a screen instead of in person. And a movie is described as \u201ca series of moving images shown on a screen, usually with sound, that make up a story.\u201d Plus you were willing to compromise by watching it another night, just not on your movie night. Still, it\u2019s probably not worth arguing over. You have a nice tradition going and it would be a shame if it ended because of this.", "If it's Harry Potter then Yes....", "YTA For pushing and pushing (but not for having the opinion you do). Why is this a huge deal? This is one movie night out of many so it's not like she's not asking too much here.\n\nSometimes we do things we're not interested in to make our loved ones happy.", "I was gonnnna say NTA based on the situation, because I do agree that watching a recorded concert on a movie night is not the vibe. Especially if you aren\u2019t a fan of the music yourself. \n\nHowever. After reading your responses to these comments, YTA. You\u2019re being SO stubborn about the semantics of what a movie night is to you that I wonder if you might be autistic (bc I am as well and this sounds like neurospicy behavior). One thing I\u2019ve learned being in a LTR and having rituals is that it\u2019s about the time you\u2019re spending together and setting aside for one another, not necessarily the activity. Of course it\u2019s ideal to both like the entertainment, but it\u2019s just not the main idea. It\u2019s like if you two had \u201crestaurant night\u201d and she wanted to have a picnic instead. You\u2019re still gonna eat dude, and it\u2019s just one meal.", "YTA and a very pedantic asshole at that", "NTA. Not a movie. Lol", "YTA.\n\nI used to be married to someone who prioritized his specific definitions of words or interpretations of our agreements way above my actual wants and needs. \n\nI am infinitely, INFINITELY happier without him. \n\nWhat is your actual goal here? Is it to be right at all costs, even the cost of your girlfriend's happiness (or possibly the relationship itself)? Then by all means continue digging in your heels.\n\nBut if your goal is a happy relationship, then sometimes you have to compromise and do what she wants even if it's not what you want. Relationships require flexibility or they fail.\n\nAnd you aren't even technically right. There are multiple dictionaries out there that define movies in ways that could include concert films. Some do specify storytelling, but others don't.\n\nLanguage is not 100% rigid. People shouldn't be, either.", "NTA where do you guys find these insufferable brats? Who is raising these entitled girls?", "Zx NTA", "Light YTA. It\u2019s just semantics. Heaven forbid she wants to watch Hamilton on movie night, it\u2019s a play!

She\u2019s hijacking movie night. Nothing is as boring as a video of a live music.", "NTA, but is this really the *ant* hill that you want to die on? Relationships are about win-wins (don\u2019t like to use the word \u201ccompromise\u201d because it just seems negative) and if you love her, just watch the concert. There will (hopefully) be many, many more movie nights and you get to choose the next one.", "Nta at all.", "OP YTA!!! All I see is you replying about how it\u2019s movie night and it HAS to be a movie. What is so wrong about bending the rules for one night? You\u2019re going to have a million other movie nights. You think your priority would be having a nice night with the person you love. Even if it isn\u2019t a classic movie, it\u2019s going to make you\u2019re girlfriend happy. You\u2019ll get to see her smile, laugh, sing along, possibly dance around. This is a gateway to enjoying your relationship even MORE!!! Instead of being so upset that she didn\u2019t want to choose a typical movie, be happy that she wants to do something she would truly enjoy with you.", "Agreed.\n\nI\u2019d be bored out of my fucking mind myself, but I\u2019d grin and bear it and hope it earns me some goodwill for the inevitable day I pick something he absolutely hates.

I am probably the most unstructured person you'll ever meet but my bf's parents are at the other end of the extreme. Anything deviating from what is normally on the schedule apparently drives them insane and makes them less productive. On the other hand, I get extremely anxious thinking about how I have to do certain things at a certain time whenever I stay over at their place. The thing is they are open to a lot of things but it's only confined to a specific order (but sometimes time too). If it does go out of order, they'll say they're fine but you can notice how they'll feel slightly more anxious or on edge. Interestingly enough, I have recently learned that none of them were aware of this internal need for order. To be fair, I didn't realize how being orderly made me feel worse until just last year (after knowing them for 3-4 years).\n\nI get the frustration on both sides and why details a big deal for some people but imma go with NAH as well.", "\"A feature film or feature-length film is a narrative film (motion picture or \"movie\") with a running time long enough to be considered the principal or sole presentation in a commercial entertainment program.\"\n\n- Wikipedia \n\nPersonally, I would say they are both AH.
