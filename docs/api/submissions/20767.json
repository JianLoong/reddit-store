He said I deserve it for being so unclean. \n\nSo, today I got a friend of mine to swing by and we unscrewed my parents door and put up a curtain whilst they were grocery shopping.

Living this way will be taking its toll on you even if you think you are coping.\n\nYou are worth so much more than this situation.\n\nWhich country are you based in? Practical advice will vary depending on the answer, in the UK for example you will get help towards rent and living costs. \n\nGet out now before anything worse happens, good luck!", "Legend. \n\nI wish I had the balls to do something like this to my own parents.\n\nEdit: the only way I got my door back when I was a teen was changing naked where people would see.", "NTA taking your door is overstepping, privacy is needed after a certain age (like when you don't have to worry about safety as much like you would a 5 yo choking on something)", "NTA  There's no excuse for taking your door.  I don't think I'd feel safe there.", "NTA\n\nBut you have to realise all your parents suck. Even a shitty dad wouldve come and taken you home with him after hearing even 5% of these stories.\n\nYour mom is a ho, your dad is a bum and your stepdad is insane. Lovely way to grow up.\n\nGet out of there asap and dont go live with your bio dad. Find your own place asap.", "NTA honestly your step-dad sounds gross. Could you explain the situation to a friend and possibly stay with them during the school week", "NTA. Ask him why he wants a young women who he isn't related to have no door.

Wish I could've thought of this when my step-dad pulled similar stunts to me. My dad definitely would've helped me remove and hide the door, lol.\n\nMy step-dad removed one door because I used to lock him out (my mom still insists it was because I slammed the door) and they put up a raggedy blanket instead. Then about 6 months after that, mom and step-dad moved me from one bedroom to one closer to their room, while I was vacationing with my dad - no I was not informed nor part of the discussion. This bedroom door lasted a few months before it fell off its frame during an argument (step-dad was trying to force his way in, I was trying to keep him out), and about 6-9 months after it was replaced, step-dad removed the doorknob because (the door squeaks!\" Yeah, the squeaks didn't stop since it was the hinges, but they never replaced the knob.

I would have left as soon as my mum married him", "That's a really good idea, I bet it would annoy him", "That's what I think too. He's making issues for himself by going into my room which isn't even messy, just not to his standard.\n\nHe believes that it's his house (its not, it's my mum's) so everything has to look how he wants it. Even my mum's sewing room has to be overly tidy.", "Thank you. Yeah I know this isn't normal. All my friends feel sorry for me and are rooting for me to move out as soon as I can", "Lowkey I could probably stack a few more doors under my bed. Maybe like the living room, kitchen and spare bedroom ones. That'd be funny", "Yeah I agree. If I were here, I would have kicked my stepdad to the curb ages ago. He definitely did some kind of sorcery getting her to marry him.\n\nI could but it would be a lot for him to suddenly have to move and he is near his place of work. I'd feel bad asking him to do that when I can just wait this out and move. I also would feel bad to leave my mum with him. I don't know what would happen. I'm worried that she would essentially take my place being retaliated against about cleaning\n\nI have both of them blocked on all of my social medias they also have. I don't want them to see what I have on there or I would have posted as soon as they took my door", "Definitely, my dad has my passport and other things\n\nI was thinking of removing the door handle. So he has the main door but can't use it. I don't want to go too far but just like something annoying", "Thank you. Ugh its so awful that those were the measures you had to take", "That sucks to hear, what you're saying makes sense. I dunno I always saw it as a reasonable thing for why my Dad couldn't have me. It would be an hour's drive from school and I can't drive. I also can't turn his living room into my own bedroom", "All my friends know what's been going on at home for a long time now.

I saw a comments in \nHow its closer and you would need to sleep on the couch, but is it worth staying with people who treats you like this? \n\nJust because your dad isn't married to your mom anymore doesn't mean he can't advocate for you being treated with basic decency (and potentially your safety.)", "In most cases, framing, headers, and doorjambs are going to be wood 2x4s. The screws can also be used for the door handle (the faceplate on the latch and the strike face on the frame) to prevent the door from being easily kicked in.

I hate living with him so much. I don't know why my mum puts up with it. I definitely l wouldn't if I were her", "I agree with that. It's just hard to stand up to him when my mum sides with him too.

I'm an adult who takes transit for 2 hours for work by my own very dumb choices. So that's understandable. And I'm guessing it was not a great time to switch schools in grade 12. \n\nI'm sorry about your Mom, it shouldn't be on your shoulders to be worried about her. I'm not going to pretend like this is black and white, but you are the most vulnerable party here right now. You need to come first, then you can help her if she wishes to be helped.\n\nEdit: I realised I have no idea what school system you are in for grad times. I was just going off my Canadian grad dates.
