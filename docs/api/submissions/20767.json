I was definitely on my Dad's side however my Mum's house was closer to my school so I had to stick with it. I would see my Dad on weekends but they both agreed I had to stay with my Mum in the school week.\n\nMy mum met this guy Harry a couple years ago and they got married. I think their relationship is gross, he's 15 years her senior but he makes my Mum happy so I can't really do anything about it. He has made my life hell. There's no mutual respect between us and I keep out his way and he keeps out of mine. I think he has OCD or something because everything has to be clean and out of sight all of the time. \n\nIf I leave any pans after I cook on the side because i'm eating my hot food and intend to wash them right after, I have to stop eating and clean them and my dinner goes cold. If I leave a book in the living room, I have to immediately put it away. If I make a cup of tea, I have to wipe down the surface. I don't spill the sugar, I don't spill any milk but the surface was technically used so it needs to be cleaned. God forbid the house doesn't look like a showroom. My mum follows his rules but I hate them. I'm not even untidy. I just don't want to clean things when they don't need to be.\n\nMy room had a door so if I left any books or paper out after studying or like an empty mug, he couldn't see them. Until he knocked on my door one time and started making me clean my own room when it's not even messy and would inspect it and make me do it again if he didn't like it. Last weekend, he decided to replace my door with a curtain so he could just pull it and see if there was any \"mess\". He said I deserve it for being so unclean. \n\nSo, today I got a friend of mine to swing by and we unscrewed my parents door and put up a curtain whilst they were grocery shopping. He helped my lift my bed which is where I'm keeping the door. As I expected, the room was bare. Everything was behind closet doors. I figure if I don't have a door as an adult, neither should he. My stepdad went mental, demanding me to reinstall the door but I refused. I said that if I can't have one, neither can he so now I have no curtain. I don't mind, I just stand by the wall to change and they haven't grounded me or taken anything too important since my Dad buys me things.\n\nMy Dad caught wind of what I did and while he thought it was funny, he said that it was their house so I need to give them the door back.

Harry is a control freak and a major creep.", "Nta. And a grown man taking away a young girl's door/curtain to her room and barging in to her room at will allowing for no privacy is abusive and feels...slimy- like he's trying to  catch you vulnerable or naked. And your mother allowing this stranger to control your homelife and be abusive/disrespectful of you is disgusting and pathetic. This isn't a safe environment for you. Time to move in with dad or find an apartment on your own and commute the extra distance to school.", "NTA. You should check your room for cameras.", "NTA. This is chaos and dysfunction to the max. You are 18. If you aren\u2019t still in school I would move in with your dad if I were you.", "IMO keep that door until he ready to mind his own business.", "NTA.  Taking your door is abusive and a red flag.", "NTA Harry is a pervert and mum cant see it, because shes blinded by the D. Sorry to be blunt but yeah, if theres no sign of dirty Harry going you should think about moving in with your dad or if you drive and have the money get a camper van. \n\nIn my opinion the dirty togger just wants to peep on you with ease and is using 'cleanliness' as a prerequisite to do so.", "NTA. I think its absolutely disgusting that your mother is not standing up for you in this situation. If any grown man (including her actual dad) tried to take my teenage daughter's door off of her bedroom, I would be highly suspicious of his intensions. You are at an age where you need privacy.\n\nKudos to you for being a boss and getting it done!", "NTA So funking weird taking an 18 year olds door. Your mum should stick up for you. I also don't understand your dad's reaction, yes your revenge was funny but I'd be more concerned if my sons stepdad had taken my teenage sons door", "NTA. How can your mum stand by & let him remove your door?! I understand wanting to keep a clean home, but he is definitely going to extreme with his behaviour. Sadly though you are 18, my best advice is to save to move out or see if you can live at your dad's. You're an adult now & it's your choice where you live. I would say to your mum that you're a grown woman & he is violating your privacy. Does she want him to see you getting changed or touching yourself? If no, then get her to give your frickin door back.", "NTA and inform someone at school about this nonsense.", "I think that's hilarious. Give it back when they give you your door back. NTA.

Why tf hasn\u2019t your mom stepped in???", "You are a clever minx!  This made me LOL.\n\nHarry is over the top, and I am sorry your Mum isn't advocating for you or defending you.  That said, you seem to be very much in control and are maintaining your sense of humor.  Well done you!\n\nGive the door back, have another laugh, and get on with your life.  I think you proved your point and then some.  NTA.", "YTA.  Move out, otherwise be respectful and stop making messes in other peoples houses.

So because of that you\u2019re the ahole in their situation. If it bothers you that much, your 18 just ask to live with your dad.

Definitely not the ass hole, dude sounds like a creep.", "NTA and tbh that's not a good situation. People are entitled to privacy, no matter their age and the fact that he's invading your space like that is alarming.", "NTA, you were brilliant. Seriously though, as an 18 year old you are a mature young lady. With a mature body that needs privacy. You have a right to a closed room to change, groom yourself, sleep or be in your own space. Taking your door violates many boundaries and stinks of an old man wanting to catch a young lady changing. It\u2019s not normal - not in the least. There is something wrong here, head everyone\u2019s warnings and check for cameras and get an exit plan now.", "Should put up her own to catch him creeping while shes sleeping.

He thinks it's fine that you don't have any privacy at all over there??
