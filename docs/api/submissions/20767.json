I was definitely on my Dad's side however my Mum's house was closer to my school so I had to stick with it. I would see my Dad on weekends but they both agreed I had to stay with my Mum in the school week.\n\nMy mum met this guy Harry a couple years ago and they got married. I think their relationship is gross, he's 15 years her senior but he makes my Mum happy so I can't really do anything about it. He has made my life hell. There's no mutual respect between us and I keep out his way and he keeps out of mine. I think he has OCD or something because everything has to be clean and out of sight all of the time.\n\nIf I leave any pans after I cook on the side because i'm eating my hot food and intend to wash them right after, I have to stop eating and clean them and my dinner goes cold. If I leave a book in the living room, I have to immediately put it away. If I make a cup of tea, I have to wipe down the surface. I don't spill the sugar, I don't spill any milk but the surface was technically used so it needs to be cleaned. God forbid the house doesn't look like a showroom. My mum follows his rules but I hate them. I'm not even untidy. I just don't want to clean things when they don't need to be.\n\nMy room had a door so if I left any books or paper out after studying or like an empty mug, he couldn't see them. Until he knocked on my door one time and started making me clean my own room when it's not even messy and would inspect it and make me do it again if he didn't like it. Last weekend, he decided to replace my door with a curtain so he could just pull it and see if there was any \"mess\". He said I deserve it for being so unclean.\n\nSo, today I got a friend of mine to swing by and we unscrewed my parents door and put up a curtain whilst they were grocery shopping. He helped my lift my bed which is where I'm keeping the door. As I expected, the room was bare. Everything was behind closet doors. I figure if I don't have a door as an adult, neither should he. My stepdad went mental, demanding me to reinstall the door but I refused. I said that if I can't have one, neither can he so now I have no curtain. I don't mind, I just stand by the wall to change and they haven't grounded me or taken anything too important since my Dad buys me things.\n\nMy Dad caught wind of what I did and while he thought it was funny, he said that it was their house so I need to give them the door back. AITA?\n\n\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nI'm glad to know I wasn't being crazy about this and I'm going to reinstall his door on my room with different screws, putty and a lock so I don't have to worry about him barging in anymore. Hopefully he doesn't make my life hell but I'm moving out asap. I am going to bed now since I accidentally pulled an all nighter thinking about this.
