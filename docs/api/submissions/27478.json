I've been called the AH from some people, but others understand. So little back story my dad held my sister and I against our will in japan from our mom for 8 years. We finally got to see our mom during a Christmas break. I was about to head back to Japan when the airport said we couldn't without a guardian over 16. Neither of us were 16, so my dad said he would come pick us up. 2 weeks past and we heard nothing from him, so I called, and he said we could stay and that he had already sold our stuff and made my room into a nursery for his new wife's future baby. I was shocked because that was all of my stuff. I only had a suitcase of 2 weeks' worth of clothes. About 3 years later, my mom served my sister and I with papers stating our dad was emancipating both of us(disowned). It was really hard at first, but I moved on and hadn't really heard from him. Years gone by where I'd say happy birthday or wishing him happy holidays... nothing. I gave up, and as soon as I gave up, he started putting effort in a little. He would say hey whats up? I haven't heard from you and I foolishly at first replied just to be left on read. I stopped replying, and after a few months of the same messages coming through, his wife sent me a huge paragraph stating how horrible we were for not talking to our father. How we almost ruined his marriage and that he's upset he isn't in our life. I left her on read too, but I starting to feel like yea, im the AH because at least he's trying now.
