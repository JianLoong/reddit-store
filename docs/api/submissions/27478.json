Ive been call the AH from some people but others understand. So little back story my dad held my sister and I against our will in japan from our mom for 8 years. We finally got to see our mom during a Christmas break. I was about to head back to Japan when the airport said we couldn't without a guardian over 16. Neither of us were 16, so my dad said he would come pick us up. 2 weeks past and we heard nothing from him so I called and he said we can stay and that he already sold our stuff and made my room into a nursery for his new wife's future baby. I was shocked becuase that was all of my stuff I only had a suitcase of 2 weeks worth of clothes. About 2 years later my mom served my sister and I with papers stating our dad was emancipating both of us(disowned). It was super really hard at first but I moved on and hadn't really heard from him. Years gone by where I'd say happy birthday or wishing him happy holidays... nothing. I gave up and as soon as I gave up he started putting effort in a little. He would say hey whats up haven't heard from you and I foolishly at first replied just to be left on read. I stopped replying and after a few months of the same messages coming through, his wife sent me a huge paragraph stating how horrible we were for not talking to our father. How we almost ruined his marriage and that he's upset he isn't in our life. I left her on read too, but I starting to feel like yea im the AH becuase at least he's trying now.

I celebrate that in you. Tell your dad's wife the truth: My father abandoned me and my sister. Sorry that's news to you. Please don't contact me again after you've feasted on his lies. I wish you luck, though. Hopefully he will love your child and never toss him away like garbage.\n\nHe can't make up for his past abuses because that's just not possible.

I tried to reconcile but too much had happened and she couldn't help but play games so I made the choice to cut her out of my life. To be honest it's their loss as they're the ones who will miss out on seeing the milestones in life: graduation, wedding, grandchildren being born.
