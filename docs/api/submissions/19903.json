My wife has a friend with a non verbal, autistic son(6m).  The problem is that when they come over, she sees it as an escape from parenting while they are here.  He gets into everything, despite me and my wife patiently explaining certain areas are off limits.  My son(5m) is past the point of needing cabinet locks, so we don\u2019t have them on this house we just built.  I\u2019ve asked her several times to keep him out of areas that have things that either he could get hurt with, or things that we don\u2019t want broken.  The mother always just kind of blows it off by making excuses for the behavior and not really respecting my wife and I\u2019s wishes.  He chases our cats to the point that they hide under beds until they leave.  \n\nI understand that parenting a young child can be stressful, and the father is kind of worthless when it comes to helping the child rearing.  Add to that the fact that he is non verbal, I\u2019m sure that adds a lot of stress.  I sympathize that this may be an opportunity for her to relax and unwind, but should we have to be the ones to facilitate it?  My wife doesn\u2019t like the situation, but feels for her friend, who needs a break.\n\nLooking for some good, objective point of views here to help me understand this, and maybe be a better person in this case.\n\nEDIT:\nSorry, I put 5m and 6m for their age and sex, so my son is 5 and her son is 6.\n\nMy cats are both older, but also still have their claws as I don\u2019t believe in declawing.  If locking them in a room is the rational decision, I\u2019ll do it.  Just hate doing that to them.\n\nUPDATE:\nI know this hasn\u2019t been up long, but my wife and I sat down and talked about it.  We decided that our home isn\u2019t the safest environment for her son to be in.  We decided that her friend does need a break from time to time and found someone that specializes in autism that would go on outings with them.  Places like the park to start, maybe pools, the zoo, etc.  Basically this person will help out watch him so that the mom can have a break, but still be around in case problems arise.  This is a start for my wife, and eventually myself, to hopefully help her watch him in the future.", "created_utc": 1687020811, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bvvec/aita_for_not_wanting_my_wifes_friend_to_come_over/", "score": 3950, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that he is autistic and non-verbal tends to make his behavior (NOT hers though) more understandable, but it\u2019s still not acceptable. Until she can respect the boundaries, she shouldn\u2019t be invited back over. Edited just to be clear - my real issue is with his mom, not with him. I do understand that it can be hard, but going over to someone else\u2019s home doesn\u2019t give you the right to abdicate parenting responsibilities.", "NTA.

If your wife's friend is opposed to this, the best you can do is prepare, put all the breakables into a room that can lock, bungee cord is good for cabinets (if tight the children can't get in).

Don't be argumentative, just inquisitive.

Don't offer advice unless she asks, and only focus on how your boundaries have changed. Say things like \"my wife and I talked about this for a long time\" and \"we're on the same page about this\".

He wasn\u2019t hurting anyone, and wasn\u2019t being any more disruptive than an average older baby/younger toddler would be, but he was old enough to have known better if he were a neurotypical child, and that woman felt totally justified in being judgmental and nasty. \n\nI expect your wife\u2019s friend has had experiences like that as well, and I applaud your wife for not wanting to add to that\u2026 but what you\u2019re describing is NOT okay, and your friend isn\u2019t doing her any favors by letting this continue.

Even in environments where they *do* spend a lot of time, it can take months of intense intervention for the child to grasp what the expectations are and become compliant\u2026 and the child may never understand *why* the expectations exist (I could be wrong on this part, but I think their inability to understand why they should care about something has a direct impact on how much time and work it takes to make them do whatever it is you\u2019re trying to make them do), and when they don\u2019t understand the why of it, they also don\u2019t have the ability to make the logical leaps necessary when there\u2019s the slightest variation in circumstances that might make them behave differently than what they\u2019ve been taught. Your wife could help more by visiting at the friend\u2019s house, which has hopefully been set up to meet the child\u2019s needs\u2026 that way the friend doesn\u2019t have to feel so isolated, the child is safe, and your animals and home aren\u2019t being terrorized.", "As someone with two nonverbal autistic cousins. \nNTA", "NTA I have a child with autism and there are things that we just can't do because it's not safe or fun for him.

That doesn't mean I think my word is law, but I have perspective from the other side of the coin.\n\nBeing the parent of an autistic kid is hard. There are many things that, sometimes, you just can't get them to do. Raising a puppy right now who is going through the biting stage, trying to get a kid who responds to nervous stress by laughing and flapping his arms in the dogs face who thinks this is now the biting game is hellish. We know now that we can't take him somewhere where there is a puppy he doesn't know that we can't separate him from physically. Depending on the severity of the autism, the kid may be completely unable to respond to the cats with the appropriate actions or disengage from this at all. He may be responding 100% wrong to the cats and doesn't know.\n\nThat being said doesn't excuse the mom. In my marriage, when my wife needs a break, she gets away without the kid and I am on duty. We both know and are open about when we need a break. It sounds like she may have a problem, but the husband has the larger problem. He needs to suck it up and give his wife a break.\n\nShe needs an escape from parenting, meaning a break from the kid. My wife and I and so many others with autistic kids get it. And I will say what looks like an escape from parenting might be the best she can control the chaos. It's hard to understand what it's like to control an autistic kid with ADD until that's your lot in life. I don't know how many miles of running from the back door to the front out of some unintelligible desire we have seen, but we can't really stop it. It's like asking somebody who is experiencing every emotion at once at level 11 to just sit still.\n\nThat being said, you need to have firm boundaries with the mom. Tell her what will and won't fly. If you are willing, you can shut the cats up for the time she is there. If not, then let her know that her kids terrorizing your cats is an absolute no and, if it happens, they need to go. I know that my wife and I have left places early precisely because we see a problem coming up like that. We are just used to bailing when the situation doesn't look good, to be honest.
