She is a terrible guest, save your get togethers for her house or out in public, like a park.  Maybe encourage her to look into respite care.", "NTA - I can understand parenting a non-verbal autistic son can be stressful and challenging, but when they are at your place, the mother cannot just turn off. She stays a parent with responsibilities. \n\nThe fact that the mother makes excuses for her sons behaviour also isn't good in my book.", "NTA. She wants free babysitting. Him terrorizing your cats and breaking your property should be enough to not have him over anymore.", "NTA\n\nParenting doesn't stop just because you are visiting someone. That's ridiculous. If she wants a break she can take it up with her partner or get some help to babysit the kid. And please keep him away from your cats!!", "NTA. It sounds like you've been as accommodating as you can be. Perhaps your wife can start visiting her friend at her place instead, if you're on the same page.", "NTA - You home is not the place for her break.

I was prepared to say Y T A, but no way, you are NTA. This isn\u2019t really even about him being autistic - she could do the same thing with a neurotypical kid, let him run wild, etc., and I would say the same thing. The fact that he is autistic and non-verbal tends to make his behavior (NOT hers though) more understandable, but it\u2019s still not acceptable. Until she can respect the boundaries, she shouldn\u2019t be invited back over. Edited just to be clear - my real issue is with his mom, not with him. I do understand that it can be hard, but going over to someone else\u2019s home doesn\u2019t give you the right to abdicate parenting responsibilities.", "NTA. It's fair to not want kids running around, getting into hazardous spaces and scaring your cats. If you're worried about the tough conversation then maybe your wife can just suggest going to her from now on.", "NTA You and your wife need to address the issue directly with the the friend. Let her know her son does not have free rein while his visiting your home. You need to let her know what areas of the house are in and out of bounds because you are concerned for the child's safety.  If she takes offense, so be it. Nothing is preventing your wife from meeting her friend at a park, cafe, visiting  her home, etc. You need to establish some parameters for her visits.", "NTA, but start with a real conversation with her (without her son around) about how disruptive he is. Tell her you value her friendship and time with her, but she has to keep her son under control or he is likely to be injured or something else bad might happen.

I agree with your wife, personally I\u2019d prbly do the same for my friend if they were in that situation. But, the concerns and points you made are completely valid. \n\nI think the best course is to show support to wife\u2019s friend, let her know you guys want to help but some ground rules need to be placed for it to work for everyone. Whatever rules or boundaries you want to set I think would be up to you and your wife and then present it to the friend and go from there.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife\u2019s friend has a tough job.

This mother is taking advantage of you and being a bad parent. Full stop.", "NTA until you actually come after her for it, so perhaps a compromise could be met? Do you have a backyard on your property? Let the kids burn energy in the yard. Also, most yards are practically designed so you, wife, and friendo will always see the kids in your line of vision. If your wife's friend is opposed to this, the best you can do is prepare, put all the breakables into a room that can lock, bungee cord is good for cabinets (if tight the children can't get in). You can also sit down and have a frank discussion, but that might go as badly as coming at her. No parent wants to hear they are raising their child wrong and will get upset or defensive.", "This is a genuinely tricky situation. On one hand, you have a parent who, whether or not they're doing the best *they* can, does not have the proper support for her non-verbal child. On the other hand, you have OP and his wife trying their best to be accommodating, but obviously struggling with a lot of the issues that come with taking care of a non-verbal child.\n\nI think the best course of action her would be to communicate with your wife first; ask her how comfortable and uncomfortable she feels with the whole situation. Don't be argumentative, just inquisitive. Mention things like the cats, don't mention things like the \"brand new cabinets\".\n\nThen, once on the same page with her, create boundaries together, and communicate that with her friend. Don't offer advice unless she asks, and only focus on how your boundaries have changed. Say things like \"my wife and I talked about this for a long time\" and \"we're on the same page about this\". If she comes back argumentative, then you provide her with resources on how to best support her own child. That could mean groups she can join, or specialists she can call, or what have you.", "NTA\n\nThis is talk you need to have with your wife and I get the feeling you will not be well received.  So, mitigate the issues you noted.  I know its a pain in the ass but this way you will show your wife you are trying and if this fails then you have a stronger argument.\n\nSo when they are coming over;\n\n* put the cats in a room with water and their litter box\n* buy some of those plastic hallway gates that can restrict movement\n* Tape cabinet doors shut or install child proof stuff on dangerous or expensive stuff\n\nWhen mom and child come over again let her know what you have done and explain again off limits and danger areas.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She can either help communicate that to the kid or ignore it but the idea is to acknowledge there are rules in your home that need to be communicated to this kid in a language he understands.
