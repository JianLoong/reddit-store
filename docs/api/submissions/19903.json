Even in environments where they *do* spend a lot of time, it can take months of intense intervention for the child to grasp what the expectations are and become compliant\u2026 and the child may never understand *why* the expectations exist (I could be wrong on this part, but I think their inability to understand why they should care about something has a direct impact on how much time and work it takes to make them do whatever it is you\u2019re trying to make them do), and when they don\u2019t understand the why of it, they also don\u2019t have the ability to make the logical leaps necessary when there\u2019s the slightest variation in circumstances that might make them behave differently than what they\u2019ve been taught. Your wife could help more by visiting at the friend\u2019s house, which has hopefully been set up to meet the child\u2019s needs\u2026 that way the friend doesn\u2019t have to feel so isolated, the child is safe, and your animals and home aren\u2019t being terrorized.", "As someone with two nonverbal autistic cousins. \nNTA", "NTA I have a child with autism and there are things that we just can't do because it's not safe or fun for him.

The alternative to this is that she spends her visit exclusively parenting her child and not talking to anyone she came to visit. Honestly i despair of a society where we act like disabled people and children aren\u2019t a normal part of society and that people may need accommodations to visit your home.

What is poor parenting is that this mother is letting her child terrorise someone else\u2019s pets, and letting the child destroy their house. The child having autism is *not* an excuse.", "I once heard a phrase that kind of applies here. \"Boundaries are the distance you can love someone else and still love yourself.\"\n\nHaving to redo your living space so someone can visit because they are ignoring the boundaries you set isn't loving yourself. Despite the hardship this mother is going through, she needs to love the people she is visiting enough to listen too. While this doesn't mean they should be cruel, it does mean they shouldn't need to continue things as is and having this pair over as guests may not be an option", "They're really doing it more as a favor for the friend. I could see not intrusive childproofing IF the friend paid for it. \n\nThere is a reason accomodation laws don't apply to private residences. People should be able to enjoy their own home, living in a way comfortable for themselves,  without worrying about an ill behaved sometimes guest. \n\nPresumably,  the friend's house is already childproof, so meetings should be there or in public.", "Not to say she's not doing that. But from this perspective it doesn't seem like it. You can never start too early either.", "Exactly. Honestly I feel like a lot of people I know who have a fear or dislike of either cats OR dogs had some kind of unpleasant experience with one as a child, that could probably have been prevented by better monitoring from their parents.", "Then she\u2019s a terrible friend. she is literally allowing her child to terrorize animals that could very well harm him (I have 20 year old scars from cats) and ignoring the hosts when they tell her they\u2019re concerned that her child will harm himself or their belongings. They are not responsible for his safety at the end of the day. She is, and she is blowing it off. If she\u2019s not willing to keep her kid out of trouble while she visits she needs to make alternate arrangements.\n\nYou can\u2019t expect someone to lock their pets, everything sharp they own, all their cleaning supplies, and anything fragile up every time this kid comes to visit. That goes beyond reasonable accommodations.

OP isn\u2019t either, it\u2019s his house and he\u2019s already communicated with both kid and mom what is and isn\u2019t okay. \n\nThe mom is failing as a mom.", "No, the alternative is meeting elsewhere. Or not meeting at all. Why can't they meet at her home? \n\nThis isn't just about sharp objects.

But if OP wants to, this is so easy to do, and for a friend most people would be willing to make some accommodations.  Hateful people, on the other hand, will throw an absolute fit at the mere suggestion that they do something nice for a friend.  Go figure.", "There\u2019s definitely space to meet in the middle. My cats don\u2019t mind being locked in a room with their things, they prefer it if they know they have a totally safe space where they won\u2019t be bothered. They know how to do normal childproofing so could just do that, it doesn\u2019t have to be every possibility and would likely take as long as it would take to get out a piece of plywood. The mom isn\u2019t doing a great job but maybe she\u2019s doing her best. Respite isn\u2019t an option here and babysitters arent ideal for vulnerable young people who can\u2019t tell you if anything happens to them. If someone\u2019s toddler comes to visit me then i would do the basic things and watch their kid so they can catch up with their wife. It\u2019s common to be kind to friends, this friend needs a little more help to be in this environment so just do basic things that make these visits easier for all", "I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t meet in her home, that\u2019s obviously the easiest solution but i assumed there was a reason that wasn\u2019t an option. Sharp objects away, lock bedroom doors, put breakable objects behind those doors, confine cats to one of those rooms and maybe put tape on cupboard doors, maybe 10 minutes work. Maybe they live in a mansion though", "Easiest solution is meeting elsewhere.", "The solution of child locks ignores the needs of his cats. They have needs and deserve safety too", "There\u2019s still the issue where we don\u2019t know if they have a room to do that in, plus everything else they\u2019d have to move. As for child proofing, if mom isn\u2019t going to do anything (which it seems like she won\u2019t. Either she doesn\u2019t believe them or she doesn\u2019t care) then it is a big ask. they\u2019d either have to make permanent changes to their brand new cabinets, or rush around making sure those cabinets are empty every time the kid comes over, not to mention remove and fragile Knick knacks, low hanging paintings, or whatever other breakables they have the op has already said he fears for. That\u2019s a lot more time and effort than just laying down some ply wood. \n\nThen mom can ask family, or a specialized daycare, or just keep an eye on him while she\u2019s visiting. If she has to hover over him so constantly that she can\u2019t divert him from things he\u2019s not supposed to be in, or find him something to keep him occupied (puzzles, books, an iPad jfc) and STILL have a conversation then he should, once again, not be there. \n\nIt\u2019s not \u2018easier for all\u2019 in this case. It\u2019s just \u2018easier for mom\u2019. Helping out with your friends kids is one thing, I\u2019ve had kids dumped on me out of nowhere before, but unless you\u2019re going to recant your statement about scolding an autistic child, OP literally has no way to keep this kid from causing harm to his belongings. Mom does.", "Again, OP stated he doesn\u2019t want to ruin his cabinets.  I pointed out there are ways to childproof without ruining cabinets, so that one piece should not be an obstacle.", "They have a 5 year old and cats, it\u2019s very unlikely they have much childproofing to do. Scolding isn\u2019t the only way to stop a child from damaging things, redirecting is definitely more than adequate for most situations. Specialised daycare? We must live in different worlds if they provide drop in options where you live. If they want to keep this family in their lives then they will have to make things a little easier for the mom to visit. If they don\u2019t want to continuing this relationship then mom will be another invisible carer. Everyone has a responsibility to make reasonable accommodations so disabled people can grow up in society instead of isolated from society. Sure the mother also isn\u2019t being responsible, i\u2019m not arguing that she\u2019s doing a great job but often ND kids have ND parents who are doing their best", "I'm not arguing it is a possible solution to an aspect of the situation, just stating it is not a solution to all of it and OP is not unkind for not being ok with things as they are. Relationships are supposed to go both ways, even if they tilt one way from time to time. This one is not, and even with a good reason, it sounds to me like time to move to other options. Meeting at her house or a park like someone suggested sounds much more healthy for OP and his family while still keeping their home safe for the pets and keeping the child from being hurt due to lack of oversight."]}
