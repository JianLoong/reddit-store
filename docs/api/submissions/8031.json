You had to have something in your home that wasn't on the top ten wanted poster of foods people are allergic to.\n\nYou don't say how long you had the child in your care. You called it a playdate, so I'm thinking 3-4 hours tops. You don't say if it included a mealtime. If it did or the playdate was longer, then you really needed to feed the child.\n\nHaving said that, the parent of the child may have disagreed with your caution, but still could have been nicer about it - if you were doing them a last minute favor and they were unreachable.
