Most of the time if there is a serious allergy, the parents going to tell you. And if the kids old enough, they can tell you. Not to mention, just stay away from the main ones that could cause serious injury or harm. Don't give any nuts, don't give any seeds, don't give any dairy, if you're that concerned. You could have given the kids some chips or a banana and been perfectly fine.

Why tf would you allow or invite a child into your home for playdate that went near or during mealtimes and not feed them?! Most kids who have serious food allergies or sensitivities or intolerances arent a secretive bunch. Their parents are very mindful of sharing them, making sure you can meet the needs, provide an environment free of allergens or cross contamination concerns, and if they aren't sure they'll provide a meal or snack(s). Wtf! How would you feel as that kid? Would you like being hungry and watching someone else eat in front of you or smelling food being made knowing you're not allowed to have any?! How heartless are you? You completely lack empathy and care for others and you're tryin to mask it with concern. If you were concerned about allergies, you would've asked at the beginning of the playdate or when it was planned.

As a kid I was super allergic to raspberries but I loved them so whenever someone else had raspberries or I saw them I\u2019d ask for them not caring and remembering what an allergic reaction feels like. Plenty of kids will try peanuts saying they aren\u2019t allergic when they are because they don\u2019t want to miss out and don\u2019t understand the severity of the issue. So fruit isn\u2019t always a safe option, and if you\u2019re that worried about a kids allergies you probably shouldn\u2019t feed them. You could give a granola bar to find out they can\u2019t eat wheat, a sandwich with meat when they only eat vegan at home, etc etc. While I think op could\u2019ve tried harder to either reach the parents, find something about allergies from school or possibly tried to identify a safe food for the kid, I can\u2019t blame them for being too anxious to feed a kid if they don\u2019t know about allergies because anything could spark a reaction and I damn well know those parents would\u2019ve been far more pissed if they eventually looked at their phone and found out their kid ended up in the hospital that they now have to foot a bill for.", "I did that with apples.

Probably not, even in a minor emergency. \n\nSecond, at 5, you could ask the kid if they have any allergies. Sure, 5 year olds aren't super reliable, but at that age it's still reasonable to assume a child who has allergies *should* be able to reliably say \"yes\" to that yes/no question (reliably listing those allergies might be another story). Kids without allergies are either going to say \"no\" or look at you like a deer in the headlights and say \"I don't know\" because they've never heard of allergies before. You could even follow up with something like \"are there any foods that make you sick or foods that your mom tells you not to eat?\" to be extra safe. \n\nThird, you could have asked the kid what food their mom or dad usually gives them after school and gone with the least risky thing they mentioned. \n\nBy asking the kid if they have allergies, and asking them for a food suggestion, you'd have fully covered your ass, especially since the parents didn't disclose any allergies.
