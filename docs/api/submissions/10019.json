Ryan and I were together for 2 years prior to getting married. We both knew about each other's children. I have a pair of twins, and an older child (5M/F, 8M) and he has two kids, one living with their mother (15M), and one living with us (14F) who we\u2019ll call Anna.\n\nAnna came to live with us because she no longer wanted to deal with her mother, I\u2019m not entirely sure what happened there. I don\u2019t expect her to tell me any more than that. Her father and I discussed the situation, and I do not tell her what to do or treat her as my own child. \n\nBut ever since her moving in a year ago, things haven\u2019t been super fair to my children, nor has she been nice to them. If needed, I\u2019ll provide a few examples, but I\u2019m trying to stay under the word count.\n\nMost recently, she absolutely refuses to let them play anything on the playstation and has been doing so since last year. Ryan bought her a ps5 for christmas, but when setting it up they decided that her PS4 was better and sold the ps5, so she decided to put that money aside and save up. Now, my children can\u2019t use the ps5 because it\u2019s sold, but they can\u2019t use the ps4 because she refuses to let them after one incident. I did confront Ryan about this, but he argued that I said he shouldn\u2019t get them anything tech-wise, and that the ps5 wasn\u2019t a gift for them anyway, he didn\u2019t decide what to do with it. I accepted that argument.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve been asking her to be nice and let my kids have a turn on the ps4 when she\u2019s not using it, (which she doesn\u2019t do much, she only plays for an hour after school on wednesdays, weekends, and whenever she has a friend over.) She said no time and time again, a few of those times her reasoning changed from, \u201dWhat if it happens again?\u201d, to \u201cMy playstations in my room, I don\u2019t want them in there.\u201d, to \u201cIf they really wanna play you should buy them their own.\u201d. And while that sounds like a great solution, I don\u2019t see the point in buying a whole new one when there is already one they can use. So, I asked her father about it and he said that I need her permission, since it was a gift to her and her things aren\u2019t his to have a say over.  \nSo, after trying time and time again, I gave up. But then she and her girlfriend went out yesterday to get coffee and buy some books. She wasn\u2019t here so I thought it\u2019d be fine to let my kids play, since they couldn\u2019t bother her since she wasn\u2019t even in her room and my kid swore he wouldn\u2019t do what he did last time. It was going great until 4pm, and I heard my kids crying as well as screaming. I went upstairs to check, and sure enough Anna threw them out and was yelling at them. I told her to talk to them calmly then she screamed at me as well.\n\nNothing happened this time and nothing was broken, I personally think she overreacted, but Ryan still hasn\u2019t talked to me and neither has Anna. My friends agree with me though, but now I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676458508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112vd6e/aita_for_asking_my_stepkid_to_be_nice_to_my_own/", "score": 3380, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I speak as a former step parent and step child. You crossed major boundaries by letting them in her room without permission. It's her room and her game system, she doesn't have to share and especially not with small children. Buy them their own system and respect your step daughters space and possessions.", "100%  YTA. You have been told multiple times by your stepdaughter and your husband that she does not wish to share her PS4. You do not own the item, it is not for you to say that it is fine for your children to use it if your stepdaughter says no. If you want your children to be able to occasionally play games you need to buy them a system of their own.", "YTA\n\nThere are a plethora of reasons why it's a bad idea to let your young children (two 5 year olds and an 8 year old) play with a PlayStation that doesn't belong to them/you. And unsupervised, too. \n\n\\- The PlayStation doesn't belong to them\n\n\\- The owner of the playstation explicitly said no\n\n\\- The PlayStation is inside a private room that is off limits for your kids\n\n\\- The kids don't have their own user account. They use the account of Anna, which means that they will easily overwrite save files, or they can mess up progress Anna has made over a long time. \n\n\\- depending on how Anna pays for her PlayStation games/content, there is a risk that your young kids mess around with the store and \"accidentally\" buy stuff via Anna's account. \n\n\\- Anna likely has/plays games that aren't suited for 5-8 year old children. \n\n\\- There already were incidents before where the kids broke something. \n\nAnna isn't \"mean\" when she denies your kids her PlayStation. She has very reasonable boundaries and you went behind her back and didn't respect her private space nor her property. Stop this and buy your kids their own gaming equipment.", "YTA. The PlayStation is Anna\u2019s. Full stop. How many times do you need to be told, her property. She has calmly said no. So you went behind her back and asked hubby, who said the same thing: NO. I don\u2019t care where it is\u2026.the answer is no. If you want one for your children, buy one. You are teaching your children that it\u2019s ok to sneak around other people\u2019s wishes if they aren\u2019t watching. Anna won\u2019t trust you at all either, and with good reason. Similarly, you are placing your own relationship at risk\u2026.how can your partner trust you? You nag and nag till you get what you want, and if not you take it? Grow up! No is no. Be trustworthy. And buy your children one, if you have promised that they can play on it!", "YTA if the Playstation is HERS then your kids have no rights to it unless SHE let's them.  If the PS5 was HER gift, then she should be allowed to do what she wants, and she sold it.  (Honestly don't blame her, I have a PS4 and no intention of getting a 5 any time soon.) \n\nIt sounds like you expect her to not be allowed to have her own personal boundaries and expect her to give your kids anything of hers to make them happy. \n\nNo wonder she's trying to keep distance from you acting entitled to HER things.  If you want your kids to have a PS so badly, go out and buy them one YOURSELF.  You let your kids into HER ROOM and act like she's the one in the wrong for being upset with you over the crap you keep pulling.\n\nYour husband SHOULD be on his kid's side and I'm glad he is.  You're an AH to her and no wonder she was upset.  That's HER ROOM and you think your kids get free reign over her things.  \n\nI hope he leaves you, as you shown you don't care about his daughter at all.\n\nAlso, what games are you thinking it's appropriate for a FIVE year old to play in the first place, if she doesn't have any kid friendly games?  Are you even monitoring what your kids are playing?  There's a very big age gap between the kids and if she's anything like I was, I had very violent games in my teens and definitely not something I'd let a closer to a toddler than teenage child play.", "\u201cAnd while that sound like a great solution, I don\u2019t see the point in buying a whole new one when there is already one they can use.\u201d\nBut they can\u2019t. Don\u2019t you understand? Didn\u2019t she tell you several times she doesn\u2019t want anyone to go in her own room and use her PS? Are you a child that doesn\u2019t understand boundaries? Suck it up and buy another one for your own kids or tell them why you\u2019re not getting them one. Don\u2019t shift the blame onto her. Also, you\u2019re not not describing \u201cthe incident\u201d because of the word count but because that actually explains her denying your kids playing with one of the few things in YOUR house that belongs to HER.\n\nAnother thing. You should be able to understand that, while they\u2019re all kids, there\u2019s a significant age difference between your kids and her. That means she understands the material value of most stuff whereas your kids don\u2019t know how to look after things (not to break it/pour a glass of milk over it, etc.) - which brings me back to the previous point, that you\u2019re most likely intentionally not going into details of what\u2019s happened previously.\n\nYou have to be the bigger person because you are an adult. You do know that whatever\u2019s happened before, there\u2019s a chance it could happen again.\n\nAnd yet, QUOTE: after \u201ctime and time again you gave up\u201d but then you big fat did it again anyway. AND you went upstairs because you heard screaming. So you weren\u2019t even there to make sure your kid won\u2019t do \u201cthe same\u201d as last time to begin with.\n\nAre you joking?\n\nYTA.", "She does not let your kids play with HER property? You do know that she is well within her rights to do that, right?\n\nYou do understand the difference between \"mine\" and \"yours\"?\nJudging by your invasion of her privacy, you don't.

You feel entitled to HER things and are placing your kids above her.  Her room, her stuff, she is a teenager and has the right to privacy and to decide what she will allow or not and yup, she might sometimes choose selfish.\n\nYou're teaching your kids that no doesn't really always mean no btw, that it's okay to be sneaky", "YTA. She is not obligated to like your kids. She is not obligated to share with your kids. If you want your children to have a games console to share between them, then you buy it for them. Instead of doing that, you crossed a clear boundary she had set, which resulted in your kids getting shouted at. This is all on you. You're teaching your kids that they don't have to respect her right to privacy and property.\n\nThis is a traumatised teen who has chosen to live away from her mother. She needs a safe, secure home and not to feel forced into behaving like a nuclear family when she isn't in one.\n\nThe most you can expect here is for them all to be considerate of others in the household. This means respecting one another's spaces,  knocking on doors and not entering rooms without permission, saying good morning, good night, please, and thank you.", "YTA \n\nThe PlayStation is Anna\u2019s. I\u2019m of the full belief that if something is specifically owned by one kid, you can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t force them to share it. It\u2019s theirs. Not to mention the fact it\u2019s in her room and she doesn\u2019t want them going in there which is 100% understandable. That\u2019s her private space. \n\nJust buy your kids their own PlayStation and none of these arguments would happen. You can get a cheap second hand one. Your poor kids got shouted at because of what YOU did.

Your title is clickbait\u2026I envisioned you wringing your hands and wailing about this older child bullying and harassing your defenseless crying kids.  \n\nNope, you are invading her privacy and wanting your young kids to play with her property, and there was apparently a damage incident previously you are curiously not sharing details on.\n\nSo, if stepdaughter wants to wear all your jewelry and clothes, and you say no, you\u2019re fine with her going into your bedroom and taking whatever she wants, right? This is the same thing.  \n\nYou\u2019re teaching your kids some pretty crappy lessons and values here, and blaming the wrong person.  Do better, by everyone.", "Sorry OP, but YTA. Your children are 5 and 8, while your stepdaughter is a literal teenager. Your kids shouldn't be in her room and invading her privacy. They have nothing in common and I don't think your 5-year-olds are old enough to be playing the videogames teenagers play. Your husband has the correct stance on this and you need to BACK OFF. Now. Otherwise you'll just create resentment in the household (you're already on this path btw). But seriously. Stop teaching your kids that it's okay to invade someone else's privacy because you're raising entitled brats at this point. Respect your stepdaughter and her father!", "YTA.\n\nThe PS4 is HER's. She says no time and time again and what you decide to do behind her back? Let your kids use the PS4 anyway. Even your husband refused to overrule Anna's decision and said no to you\n\n>\"If they teally wanna play you should buy their own.\"\n\nThis OP, deadass this. Buy them their own PS4. I don\u2019t know what this previous incident was but I assume it involves them breaking something or a very valid reason for Anna to protect her stuff. Keep this up and Anna will start to lock her door or ask for a lock on her door.\n\nPersonally, a 5 and 8 year old shouldn\u2019t have a PS4 or any electronic because they are very likely to break it because ya know they're kids. \n\n>I don\u2019t see the point of buying a whole new one when there is one they can use\n\nYou will have to buy a new one if they end up breaking Anna's PS4 regardless. It's better they break their own instead of someone else's and you end up buying a brand new one\n\nEDIT: Well, some very interesting information came to my attention. So your kids:\n\n1. Broke a PS4 remote and it took you 4 months to replace it\n\n2. One of your kids tripped over a wire and nearly broke the entire PS4 on their head\n\n3. Accidentally erased all of Anna's data\n\nAnd you really expect Anna to share her PS4 with your kids?! You deadass about this OP? You\u2019re further TA now that I know what those incidents were and Anna's reasons for protecting her PS4 is beyond valid", "Of course YTA. \nYou\u2019ve stated that something happened to stop her from letting them use it so of course there is a reason for you to buy them their own instead of constantly harassing a 14 year old. \nThen you have the audacity to stomp on her boundaries and let them use it anyway & are surprised they aren\u2019t speaking to you. \n\nSort it out.", "Yta those kids are not old enough to respect that kind of expensive technology without supervision which you are not doing. You let them into her room without telling her. She told you no and that tech was bought for her. This is not her \"being mean to the kids\" its her knowing full well they will break it and then she gets no ps4. Save up for your own why do you feel you have ownership over her things?", "YTA.

Plenty of teenagers wouldn\u2019t want a younger sibling using their PlayStation. Her father was right. It was a gift to her, and it was in her bedroom it sounds like.

Why can\u2019t you respect a 15 year-old enough to allow her this boundary?", "YTA.  If you want your kids to have a gaming system, buy a family one.  Appropriating your stepkid\u2019s possessions into being family possessions is one of the common (and very deeply resented) things bad stepparents do.  Asking her to share was fine, but forcing her to is wrong.  Are you trying to make her hate you?  Because this sort of ignoring her boundaries is a great way to do it.", "YTA. You were told no, you tried to get her Father to overrule her and were still told no.  Buy your own kids a system if you want, but her\u2019s is not for them.  The bigger deal is you let the little kids in her room, a 14 year old\u2019s room is important to them.  Boundaries really don\u2019t exist to you, do they?  You are also setting this kids up for major ongoing conflict.", "YTA. You have violated her privacy and trust. She told you know AND gave you valid solutions. Per your words you did not want any tech for your kids but your forcing someone else to let them use theirs. You sound like an entitled mom. \nThe fact that there is a gaming system in the house does not give the the right to use it. The fact that you allowed them in to the sacred space of a teenagers room when according to you has said no time and time again is just appalling to say the least. \nThe girl can\u2019t even leave the house without being violated and you say you have no clue why she\u2019s not with her mom I wager for the same issue of violating her privacy. She gave you a boundary and you basically told her feelings don\u2019t matter she doesn\u2019t matter and you\u2019ll just wait till she leaves the house to get what you want.\n\nGet ready for a huge argument with your husband he rightfully so should defend his daughter.\nJust buy them a damn console what is so hard about that. Even if she never was told they were in her room the moment she turned on the gaming system she would have known. What would you have told her then. You ma\u2019am are a flaming Entitled AH", "YTA. It's obviously not theirs to play with. This idea of the older child (and especially a stepchild) not being allowed to have their own space and things because the smaller children want to have it is really damaging. I hope you back off before you permanently damage your marriage, because the relationship with the kid is already shot but I don't think you care about that.", "YTA \n\nYou were clearly told over and over and over again no.. then you let your kids basically break into her space and use HER game system after being repeatedly told no.. and as it was a Gift for her\u2026 HER gift.. it belongs to HER. \n\nHow would you like it if she busted all up in your room and started wearing your jewelry or perfume or using your products after you kept telling her no? This is the same thing\u2026 you really disrespect her boundaries and I don\u2019t blame her for getting mad at you or your kids. \n\nGo buy them THIER OWN darn gaming system", "YTA. You're obviously the stereotypical step parent who favors your children over the step. Note I didn't say abusive, but this is clear favoritism. You have no regard for this girls property or space the second it inconveniences you.", "YTA. \nPS4s are almost dirt cheap now like under $200 cheap. Go buy YOUR kids their own system. Whatever they did the first and only time was honestly more than enough for her to not trust them. According to your husband neither system was for them anyway you said you don\u2019t treat his daughter as your own and you told him not to get your kids tech related presents. Long story short your kids are now upset because they don\u2019t have a system, but instead of getting them their own, you want to try and tell his daughter that she has to share her tech related game system. So basically you\u2019re just another entitled parent who feels that everyone around should cater to your children because YOU dropped the ball.\n\nEdited to add: don\u2019t listen to your friends who say you\u2019re not in the wrong. They sound just as entitled as you.", "YTA. She's right -- if you want to give your kids access to a PlayStation you can buy them one. Or you could have not said your husband explicitly NOT to buy them anything electronic, and simply talked over individual items case by case, and in that case he might have bought the PlayStation for the whole family.\n\nBut you didn't do that and so he didn't do that -- he bought it for *her*. Then they decided to keep her old one instead, which is equally hers and not yours. Either way, the key here is that it's hers and neither yours nor your kids'. \n\nThat means Anna has the right to say no. Is it ideally convenient for you that she says no? Of course not. Does that give you the right to override her no? Not even a little bit. \n\nApologize to your stepdaughter and then keep your and your kids' hands 100% off her PlayStation after this. If you want your kids to have one, you can still buy them one, and it doesn't matter that there is another in the household, because that one is just as much somebody else's property as if it belonged to your neighbor, or to me, or to the King of the Netherlands.

Of course they also insisted I leave the memory cards in for him to use, although there was no logical reason why. And what happens? He overwrote my save file. I am still bitter about it to this day. Its lucky that in general my parents weren\u2019t assholes though, so this was just one incident. But it sounds like you\u2019re an asshole pretty much all the time to your poor stepdaughter, and she will never forgive you for it.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo, I(34F) got married a year ago to who we\u2019ll call Ryan(44M). Ryan and I were together for 2 years prior to getting married. We both knew about each other's children. I have a pair of twins, and an older child (5M/F, 8M) and he has two kids, one living with their mother (15M), and one living with us (14F) who we\u2019ll call Anna.\n\nAnna came to live with us because she no longer wanted to deal with her mother, I\u2019m not entirely sure what happened there. I don\u2019t expect her to tell me any more than that. Her father and I discussed the situation, and I do not tell her what to do or treat her as my own child. \n\nBut ever since her moving in a year ago, things haven\u2019t been super fair to my children, nor has she been nice to them. If needed, I\u2019ll provide a few examples, but I\u2019m trying to stay under the word count.\n\nMost recently, she absolutely refuses to let them play anything on the playstation and has been doing so since last year. Ryan bought her a ps5 for christmas, but when setting it up they decided that her PS4 was better and sold the ps5, so she decided to put that money aside and save up. Now, my children can\u2019t use the ps5 because it\u2019s sold, but they can\u2019t use the ps4 because she refuses to let them after one incident. I did confront Ryan about this, but he argued that I said he shouldn\u2019t get them anything tech-wise, and that the ps5 wasn\u2019t a gift for them anyway, he didn\u2019t decide what to do with it. I accepted that argument.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve been asking her to be nice and let my kids have a turn on the ps4 when she\u2019s not using it, (which she doesn\u2019t do much, she only plays for an hour after school on wednesdays, weekends, and whenever she has a friend over.) She said no time and time again, a few of those times her reasoning changed from, \u201dWhat if it happens again?\u201d, to \u201cMy playstations in my room, I don\u2019t want them in there.\u201d, to \u201cIf they really wanna play you should buy them their own.\u201d. And while that sounds like a great solution, I don\u2019t see the point in buying a whole new one when there is already one they can use. So, I asked her father about it and he said that I need her permission, since it was a gift to her and her things aren\u2019t his to have a say over.  \nSo, after trying time and time again, I gave up. But then she and her girlfriend went out yesterday to get coffee and buy some books. She wasn\u2019t here so I thought it\u2019d be fine to let my kids play, since they couldn\u2019t bother her since she wasn\u2019t even in her room and my kid swore he wouldn\u2019t do what he did last time. It was going great until 4pm, and I heard my kids crying as well as screaming. I went upstairs to check, and sure enough Anna threw them out and was yelling at them. I told her to talk to them calmly then she screamed at me as well.\n\nNothing happened this time and nothing was broken, I personally think she overreacted, but Ryan still hasn\u2019t talked to me and neither has Anna. My friends agree with me though, but now I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Get them a PS5 and respect her privacy.", "YTA, that's not your stuff to decide who can use or not. I would be livid if I was her too (both in my teens and now as an adult). She's entitled to her own stuff and it's completely understandable that a teenager don't want younger kids in her room. You're being disrespectful of her space and her things, which it's one of the worst things you could do as her stepmom. I'm so glad your husband has a better sense of respect and is siding with his daughter. You should teach your kids to respect each other and specially her stuff too.

I would apologize and make sure it never happens again.", "YTA You need to teach your kids that if it doesn't belong to you, you need to leave it alone.

You and your kids all owe her an apology, and it needs to be sincere. You messed up. I hope you can fix it and have a better relationship with her.", "YTA- get them a Nintendo switch and a couple Mario games more appropriate for their ages and call it a day. It sounds like you are glossing over a major incident and a solid reason she doesn\u2019t want your kids on her PS4. It also sounds like you can afford another console but are choosing not to get one to prove a point. \nThis is no way to have a decent relationship with your step daughter and it sounds like you are obsessing about this for no good reason.

Seems fair!", "Yta.\n\nIt is her persona belonging that is in her room! Her room is suppose to be her safe space! And you have violated that space but allowing your children to enter it.

So if she doesn't wanna share, then she doesnt' have to. All you're teaching your kids is that it's okay to disrespect others and whatever boundaries they set.", "YTA you don\u2019t tell her what to do or treat her as your own child but expect that you get dominion over her personal belongings? Why? Because the person you\u2019re sleeping with bought it so you feel entitled to it? Because you don\u2019t want to teach your kids about boundaries? Or you just need a tech babysitter?

Yes you should have to get your own kids their own system. Hers is not theirs. She doesn\u2019t have to share. You also invaded her room and privacy after her own father backed her up.

Antics like this will only further drive the wedge between the kids. If your kids actually break something (*again* from the sounds of it) it will only further keep apart.
