Assume that a sitter with a close bond with kids cannot be an attentive figure without it being \"creepy.\"  No wonder you have not heard back from them.

I have brown hair and blue eyes. Recessive genes happen.", "Looks Jewish? Like the criteria the Nazis used?", "Lol, my husband has black hair/dark brown eye/dark skin for a white guy. He has 4 blue/green eyed blond haired children, a couple of them with light skin. You're assumption is such a wild one to make.", "\"Looks Jewish\" - I know a lot of Jews who are blue-eyed blondes.

Their parents had blue eyes and dark brown hair.", "My mom\u2019s twin has seven kids ranging from looking exactly like her with brown hair and eyes to very blonde and blue eyed. This is not unusual.", "Ignorant and racist!! If I were those parents, I would make sure my child never played with your kid again, and I would make sure all of the other parents realize that you are a racist", "Oh lord!", "I dont look like either of my parents or none of my siblings. My husband & i both have dark hair but our youngest had dark blonde hair but  now  its medium brown.", "I have black hair, green eyes, and I'm very short.

He looks like a perfect combination of both of us while somehow looking nothing like either one of us. \n\nYou are just....really dense.", "But it wasn\u2019t a sitter and you made a weird assumption.", "That would certainly be strange... but those were still presumptions that (up until you mentioned it out loud) only lived in your head. Bringing them to life in conversation made you the AH.\n\nAlso; idk if you said it to him, but commenting on a kid not looking like the parent to the parent in question is considered rude. But I dont think you mentioned saying it to him in your post.", "That\u2019s a weird thing to base whether or not someone is a parent on.", "Or maybe the kid is adopted!\n\nYTA!", "Kids can't be adopted now or anything?", "Dude who gives a shit whether they look alike? Why are you still so hung up on that?", "Look, I personally find it weird and uncomfortable that families kiss on the mouth.\n\n\nYou know what I don't do?

This is horrendous behavior, and I can't believe people are still doing this in 2023. It was bad enough 40 years ago, and I say that because there has been a lot of mixing in my family. Plus, my grandmother and many women her age gave birth to 8 or more children; whenever there are that many kids grandma always said there are bound to be some children  that don't even look related and some that may not look related to you...she had no idea how right she was. I have 3 children and I don't look like either of them to me. Maybe my son, but since we don't even look like we're the same race  you have to look past that to see our similarities.  My aunt used to be accused of being my cousins maid in the 80's even though they look just alike and always have; some strangers couldn't get past a Black woman being the mother of a white looking child. You obviously know nothing about genetics and your assumption was just as ignorant as these people I spoke of here who gave my aunt a hard time. Meanwhile, there may be a predator kidnapping a child right before your eyes but if they both look the same race and had similar features you wouldn't look twice...", "Well, maybe you do.\n\nAnd that's why you're the asshole in this situation.", "And sometimes you get it wrong and say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have assumed.\u201d Not \u201coh thank god.

I'm a blonde haired, blue eyed person married to a black haired, dark eyed person.  Kid #1 was super blond as a child...blue eyes (Now as an adult, he has light brown hair).  Kid #2?

I assumed it was a very strange family or maybe it's normal for sitters to do that.", "For you maybe. For a lot of people it's just a sign of affection. It's far more common than you think, especially outside of the US.", "This exactly. Me and my sister look nothing alike. We have the same mom, and different dads. We each are basically clones of our father. Me with very fair skin, hazel green eyes, and blonde hair that darkened to a mousy brown. Her with olive skin, dark brown eyes, and black-brown hair. But she's still my *biological* sister.", "Ok, so maybe he's adopted.\n\nMaybe he was a donated embryo for IVF.\n\nMaybe dad went sterile and they used donor sperm. Maybe mom had issues and they used a donor egg.\n\nWhen you make an assumption about parental relationships based on looks in today's world, you're an asshole, flat-out.", "The Jewish looking dads nose? Can you actually hear (or read) what you\u2019re saying?", "Quote from you OP \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen his parents\u201d. How do you, all of the sudden, know what the mother looks like?", "Genetically, you can have two parents that have brown hair and brown eyes, and it turns out their child is blonde with blue eyes. So this is a bit not valid.", "I was a blonde until I was 6, both my parents have dark hair. it's ironic that you were worried about a \"weird parent\" being around your kid, when that is exactly what every person at that camp is thinking about you now", "Dad or mom's nose? This after you said dad looks Jewish?? Damn you really are racist!!!", "How do you simultaneously hold the belief that someone shouldn\u2019t kiss a child or tell them they love them if they\u2019re not their parent, and see someone do that but still think \u201cthey don\u2019t seem like the parent\u201d?", "Lots of assumptions coming from you.  I wouldn\u2019t want my kids being around a judgmental person like you.  My husband has dark hair and eyes.  My son has really light blonde hair and blue eyes.  Bet you\u2019d assume my husbands the sitter too.\n\nEdit-Verdict YTA", "How?? You do realize people vary greatly, and many of them are still parents, right?", "And how, specifically, do a \"average male jewish millenial\" look? What features are jewish? Also, how can a religion determine genetics?", "Wtf how on earth do you know??", "YTA. Trying to call out a weird parent while commenting on Reddit about kids penises. Way to go mom of the year. You\u2019re a total weirdo.", "How the fuck would you even know that? YTA and a complete creep.", "Wtf? You don\u2019t know who the kid\u2019s parents are, but you know whether or not they\u2019re circumcised?  No way this is real.", "Ok, this cannot be real. YTA", "Whoa, who's the creep now?", "WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU!!!", "The more you type the worse you sound.", "Why do you know that but you don't know how a kid can look different than their parent?", "Jewish is an ethnicity as well as a religion. Someone can be ethnically Jewish but not practicing the religion. \n\nAlso, why do you know that?", "Wait, wait.\n\nYou were stalking her social media already and didn't also see pictures of dad?", "Why are you stalking the social media posts of someone you\u2019ve never met who likely thinks you\u2019re a creepy weirdo now?", "You can adopt and have biological children it's not either or????", "I'm sorry, how's he the creep?

They make an ass out of you not me", "Perhaps, but I think the first kiss criteria is universally accepted to be a kiss on the lips\u2026. \n\nWhich leads to my original notion of it being weird to practice that romantic gesture with your child.", "Exactly just because 2 people don\u2019t look 100% alike doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t related.", "They have five kids so I don't think fertilizing an issue", "After talking with him, I looked up their family on IG.", "My husband had super blond hair and bright blue eyes as a kid.
