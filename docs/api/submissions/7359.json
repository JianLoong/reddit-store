{"id": 7359, "submission_id": "10c4vsj", "title": "AITA for joking that my guy friend is doing a girl workout?", "selftext": "So I've (F23) been pretty active in the gym for a year and a half now. One of my guy friends Xander (M20) decided to start bulking a year ago. I've known Xander for three years now through a mutual friend, and he had honestly been a stick a majority of the time I knew him. Having been insecure and eventually grown tired of the \"scrawny shit,\" Xander decided to start working out. My boyfriend Ross (M24) and I went to the same college with Xander before we graduated last year, and last January, we both started taking Xander to the gym.\n\nI have to say, Xander ended up making great progress for a year, and he got visibly lean. Ross and my friends and I all hyped him up for this, and recently for winter break, we were all hanging out with friends at Xander's place. I asked Xander about his leg routine, and he mentioned that he had started doing barbell hip thrusts five months ago. I was a little surprised, but having the joking dynamic with Xander that I have, I said, \"Hip thrusts? That's definitely gonna do wonders for your cake like the squats, but that's sort of a girl thing bro.\" Xander chuckled and said, \"Yeah well, here I am defying the norm.\"\n\nWell last night, I ended up getting a text from Ross that he heard from our mutual friend that Xander was pretty hurt by my comment. From what Ross told me, Xander was not only hurt that I was stereotyping an exercise that he was committing to, but it apparently especially stung hearing it from his \"teacher.\" Apparently, Xander also said that it's people like me why guys are scared to do hip thrusts at the gym. It was sincerely not my intention to hurt Xander, I really was just trying to be goofy. I'm here debating over whether to apologize to Xander or not, but I also wonder if I should drop it or if it was even that bad in the first place. Ross thinks I should say something. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I can admit the joke wasn't exactly the shining example of how to encourage a gym friend, but everyone's acting like I was avidly trying to be malicious or put Xander down. And I'm not shaming Xander for this, but I also question why he felt the need to go to our other friends instead of me.

Strengthening the glutes protects the lower back and the knees. If you actually cared about his health and wellbeing, you'd be encouraging him to do it.

He is wasting his energy looking up to you if you are so uninformed.", "YTA. \n\nI mean, your internalized misogyny is showing and you're also just straight up *wrong* about hip thrusts. They're not a \"girl thing\" at all - hip thrusts are amazing for glute activation and they're one of the best exercises to train and improve your squat and deadlift. Every guy I know who's dedicated to improving in the gym and lifting heavy does hip thrusts.", "YTA.  You hurt his feelings.  You don't get to argue that it wasn't your intention.  Apologize and maybe reevaluate your thinking.", "YTA. You need to reach out with a gentle apology; something along the lines of you saying what you said, without thinking, and truly did not intend to hurt his feelings; that you are so proud of how hard he\u2019s worked and how far he\u2019s come and you don\u2019t care how he does it. That being said, only say it if you mean it.\n\nWe live in a pretty toxic misogynistic culture, which frequently tries to control and demean women. Something that we don\u2019t talk about enough is toxic masculinity; this misogynistic culture also harms men in ways that we really don\u2019t address enough. It is absolutely insane, for instance, that being compared to a woman is used to make men feel powerless and weak (see: \u201cgirly\u201d, \u201cb*tch\u201d, \u201cc*nt\u201d) .Being a woman is not a fault. \n\nBut what do we mean when we say someone is being \u201cgirly\u201d? We don\u2019t mean that they\u2019re being strong or smart or powerful. Despite the fact that girls and women are all of these things, there\u2019s still a deeply ingrained sense of this word is one of weakness.\n\nI think you meant girly in this sense, even though I also think it was unintentional. You need to work on how you define these words for yourself, and a conversation for later is maybe to discuss with your friend that being compared to a woman is not an insult.", "Haha. I implied that girls were inferior. AITA?\nYes, you\u2019re a misogynist and YTA\nDo you think it\u2019s gay to wash your a$$ as well?

I don\u2019t believe it makes OP TAH. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t understand your comment about body shaming - OP didn\u2019t say anything about her friends body, only that hip thrusts were feminine. My fianc\u00e9 laughs when I do mine, it\u2019s a funny looking exercise, and I look funny doing it. I also enjoy it and the effects", "Do you believe it was OP\u2019s intention to hurt her friend\u2019s feelings? I could be hurt by you disagreeing with my comment, would that mean that you\u2019re causing a problem? I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have apologised if he had raised it as an issue, but he didn\u2019t", "Arguably bench press for a boy workout, but that\u2019s also rooted in misogyny lol", "Well, they call it a \"man's drink\" when it's supposed to be cool and tough and \"manly\" to drink...", "That dumb cable tower butt lift thing. Doesn\u2019t do jack shit but I see women doing it constantly.", "100%", "Oh there\u2019s a whole side of TikTok/Insta Reels of thicc men and I am here for it.", "There are also elements of misandry here, hence me saying I wasn't sure which would be \"more\" appropriate. Both however, are sexism, making this a good umbrella term.\n\nETA: I'm also not sure I'd classify \"internalised misogyny\" as \"classic misogyny\". The former could be argued to be quite a different ballgame.", "I'm well aware women can be misogynistic. \n\nIf we switched the genders, and had a man making fun of a woman for doing something that was \"unwomanly\", we would call that misogyny. The inverse is misandry, and since OP was also implying that something for women was somehow \"lesser\", there we get the misogyny as well.", "Not sure what you mean sorry. My point was that gym workouts don't require genitalia (of any sort, regardless of gender), so equating *any* workout to *any* gender is idiotic and sexist.", "This is the type of \u201chumor\u201d used to demean \u201ceffeminate\u201d men for centuries. It\u2019s embedded in cultural misogyny and homophobia. The gender of the source is irrelevant.", "This all kind of seems like a mindfuck. Especially because if OP\u2019s friend has been teased and ridiculed for not being more (for lack of a better word) swoll and therefore not man enough then it\u2019s kind of both. Man this just has lots of layers.", "It\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t care if she hurt her friend\u2019s feelings, she only cares whether she can justify doing it or not.", "Our friends are pretty split. You already know Ross' feelings, but one half of our group thinks I went too far despite the intention of it being an innocent joke. On the other half, I was \"gatekeeping\" hip thrusts. Xander and I have always been able to joke around like this, bantering and laughing.", "Yeah, not to make it dirty but that extra effort has done wonders for my sex life.", "Them and kettlebell swings. More hip power focused exercises fellas!!!!", "I said this elsewhere but I played (American) college football and people would be shocked how many \u201cgirly\u201d workouts we do. If you took a second to think about it tho core strength/abs and hip flexibility is basically a synonym for \u201cathleticism\u201d.", "She hates pink and makeup and would rather be drinking beer with the boys!", "The \"butt\" of the joke, love it lol. I definitely agreed this would be a good way to apologize, but you can't do that if you're not sorry. Also:\n\n>I have a boyfriend \n\nAnd? Congrats.\n\nHumble yourself,  it may do you some good.", "That\u2019s the point gendering exercises is a problem. And it shames people because saying \u201cyou look like a girl doing this\u201d when someone is obviously a dude mentally and physically is just rude. It\u2019s demoralizing and makes you question your own confidence in your own body. It\u2019s shaming. \n\nYou may be fine with it but I would argue that as a society we shouldn\u2019t factor gender into exercising like something is good or bad. In this case OP implied it was bad he looked like he was  doing a girl workout. She attached good and bad to it.", "Hurting someone doesn\u2019t need to be intentional to be worthy of an apology. If she cares about this friend she should apologize for hurting his feelings even though she didn\u2019t mean to", "I\u2019m interested in exercises that women can do that male bodied people are biological incapable of preforming or exercises that men can do that female bodied people are biologically incapable of preforming.\n\nNot an exercise that males/females have a socialized preference for.", "What in this situation implies that masculinity/maleness is inherently bad or wrong?", "My point is that genitalia is not indicative of gender", "Oh, there are indeed workouts that require certain genitalia\u2026The internet is a rich tapestry, friendo.", "Just a trans person making sure a comment about gender and genitals wasn\u2019t made without making it about themselves. Carry on.", "I think it doesn\u2019t matter. You clearly went too far then if he is hurt. Apologize. Why do you somehow need to be right? Sometimes you just apologize to friends because you value them and want to respect their feelings.", "This could be a big moment of personal growth for you if you\u2019re able to get over yourself and put your friend\u2019s feelings before your need to be right. It\u2019s either that, or potentially lose a friend, one you probably don\u2019t deserve anyway. Be better.", "Hmm, I appreciate your perspective, but I don\u2019t equate calling an exercise feminine with saying someone looks like a woman. I\u2019m prone to gesticulating with my hands in a way that\u2019s been described as feminine; that doesn\u2019t mean I actually look like a woman, just that the action is something usually associated with females. \n\nBesides, why can\u2019t a man do something feminine? Why is everyone assuming that that\u2019s some sort of slur? If a simple comment about an exercise being feminine (not even him, but an action) hurts his feelings and causes him to question himself, then I\u2019d say that\u2019s something he should seek support for (which again, there is nothing wrong with).", "I absolutely agree. As per my other comment, I believe if he had been open with OP, she probably would have apologised and avoided similar jokes in the future - that\u2019s common decency. However, it doesn\u2019t mean the original joke makes her TAH. \n\nIf I said \u201cI like your username. Queen of Thorns reminds me of Alice in Wonderland\u201d and your feelings were hurt because you hate Alice in Wonderland and began to question your choice in username, WIBTA? Of course not. Would I still apologise? Absolutely. Would I think that reaction made you a bit of a Mad Hatter? Probably, yeah, ngl", ".... I'm well aware, as I hope I clarified with my \"any gender\" comment.", "I think the reason I assume it was negative is because if such good friends that this was normal or not patronizing and shaming then it wouldn\u2019t have made OP\u2019s friend hurt and would mean the people around her wouldn\u2019t be also thinking what she said was rude and offensive. If it was just one person being huffy then yes I would likely agree. But because her boyfriend her friend whom she hurt, and it\u2019s mutual friends who all kind of agree that it was hurtful or weird or that she needs to apologize then I think it\u2019s safe to say it was out of line and rude.", "Cool then we're on the same page", "To the first part, not necessarily. OP mentioned that he was previously very skinny and has put a lot of effort into bulking up - maybe the comment struck a nerve in a way that other comments (even ruder comments) didn\u2019t, because he\u2019s self conscious about being feminine/exercising wrong. I\u2019ve certainly reacted badly to benign comments from friends, and found \u2018horrible\u2019 comments incredibly funny. We don\u2019t always make logical sense.\n\nTo the part about their friends: possibly, if consensus is equal to proof. I don\u2019t believe it is, especially when it comes to morality. We\u2019ve seen a tiny window into OP\u2019s life - I just don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen enough to say they\u2019re an AH"]}
