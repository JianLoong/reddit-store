{"id": 7359, "submission_id": "10c4vsj", "title": "AITA for joking that my guy friend is doing a girl workout?", "selftext": "So I've (F23) been pretty active in the gym for a year and a half now. One of my guy friends Xander (M20) decided to start bulking a year ago. I've known Xander for three years now through a mutual friend, and he had honestly been a stick a majority of the time I knew him. Having been insecure and eventually grown tired of the \"scrawny shit,\" Xander decided to start working out. My boyfriend Ross (M24) and I went to the same college with Xander before we graduated last year, and last January, we both started taking Xander to the gym.\n\nI have to say, Xander ended up making great progress for a year, and he got visibly lean. Ross and my friends and I all hyped him up for this, and recently for winter break, we were all hanging out with friends at Xander's place. I asked Xander about his leg routine, and he mentioned that he had started doing barbell hip thrusts five months ago. I was a little surprised, but having the joking dynamic with Xander that I have, I said, \"Hip thrusts? That's definitely gonna do wonders for your cake like the squats, but that's sort of a girl thing bro.\" Xander chuckled and said, \"Yeah well, here I am defying the norm.\"\n\nWell last night, I ended up getting a text from Ross that he heard from our mutual friend that Xander was pretty hurt by my comment. From what Ross told me, Xander was not only hurt that I was stereotyping an exercise that he was committing to, but it apparently especially stung hearing it from his \"teacher.\" Apparently, Xander also said that it's people like me why guys are scared to do hip thrusts at the gym. It was sincerely not my intention to hurt Xander, I really was just trying to be goofy. I'm here debating over whether to apologize to Xander or not, but I also wonder if I should drop it or if it was even that bad in the first place. Ross thinks I should say something. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I can admit the joke wasn't exactly the shining example of how to encourage a gym friend, but everyone's acting like I was avidly trying to be malicious or put Xander down. And I'm not shaming Xander for this, but I also question why he felt the need to go to our other friends instead of me.

Does it matter that the particular exercise he is doing is \u201chip thrusts and squats\u201d it doesn\u2019t affect you. It just seems mean spirited.\n\nEdit: also this is body shaming. You said your friend was gaining and doing what works, then you said he was going \u201cgirly stuff\u201d and implied it\u2019s bad and he shouldn\u2019t be doing it. That\u2019s body shaming.

That mentality shows you need to either change your attitude or allow for Xander to step away from you and this friendship with some class. You do not get to decide if he deserves an apology.

He is wasting his energy looking up to you if you are so uninformed.", "YTA. \n\nI mean, your internalized misogyny is showing and you're also just straight up *wrong* about hip thrusts. They're not a \"girl thing\" at all - hip thrusts are amazing for glute activation and they're one of the best exercises to train and improve your squat and deadlift.

Apologize and maybe reevaluate your thinking.", "YTA. You need to reach out with a gentle apology; something along the lines of you saying what you said, without thinking, and truly did not intend to hurt his feelings; that you are so proud of how hard he\u2019s worked and how far he\u2019s come and you don\u2019t care how he does it. That being said, only say it if you mean it.\n\nWe live in a pretty toxic misogynistic culture, which frequently tries to control and demean women. Something that we don\u2019t talk about enough is toxic masculinity; this misogynistic culture also harms men in ways that we really don\u2019t address enough. It is absolutely insane, for instance, that being compared to a woman is used to make men feel powerless and weak (see: \u201cgirly\u201d, \u201cb*tch\u201d, \u201cc*nt\u201d) .Being a woman is not a fault. \n\nBut what do we mean when we say someone is being \u201cgirly\u201d? We don\u2019t mean that they\u2019re being strong or smart or powerful. Despite the fact that girls and women are all of these things, there\u2019s still a deeply ingrained sense of this word is one of weakness.\n\nI think you meant girly in this sense, even though I also think it was unintentional. You need to work on how you define these words for yourself, and a conversation for later is maybe to discuss with your friend that being compared to a woman is not an insult.", "Haha. I implied that girls were inferior. AITA?\nYes, you\u2019re a misogynist and YTA\nDo you think it\u2019s gay to wash your a$$ as well?

I *never* said they were \"only\" trying to prove misogyny. Jeesus. \n\nAnd yes, I have read every comment carefully. And the common theme is a blind eyed double standard. In not one comment have I a) denied it's misogyny, or b) said that misandry is the dominant form of sexism.\n\nWe're so used to seeing misogyny and calling it out, but I've literally seen *several* people on Reddit adamantly claiming that \"there's no such thing as misandry\". So, given that the comments have generally been proving misogyny rather than disproving the element of misandry, I'm keeping in mind that some people wouldn't see misandry if it hit them in the face, let alone in a more complex/subtle form such as what we see with OP. \n\nAlso the fact I'm not the only one to say misandry tells me I'm not completely left field here, so, \"have a nice rest of your day, I guess.\"", "I 100% agree that toxic masculinity hurts men, I just don't think it's done in the same way it hurts women which is why I say it's misogynistic and not misandristic. We can say that \"being like a woman is bad\" is clearly misogynistic. However, I don't think there are any facets of toxic masculinity that are misandristic.", "I think you\u2019re fundamentally misunderstanding what the definition of the word \u201cmisandry\u201d is though. Misandry is not when you are being mean to a man, or even when it is harmful to men, it is when you are saying something about a gender that is inherently negative. Me saying \u201cmen often watch sports\u201d is not misandrist because it isn\u2019t negative, similarly to how saying \u201cwomen are more likely to do hip thrusts in the gym\u201d is not misogyny, because it isn\u2019t negative in that context\u2014 just an observation. However, when you say \u201cmen shouldn\u2019t do hip thrusts BECAUSE that\u2019s a girl exercise\u201d, the inherent implication there is that it us insulting for the men to be compared to women, because being like a woman is bad. Although it does still negatively impacts an individual man, it is still a misogynistic concept. \nMost of the time, as evidenced by a lot of the modern problems men face (such as toxic masculinity), misogyny hurts both gender as men are being forced into harmful gender roles to avoid being seen as feminine. \nThis singular, isolated incident obviously isn\u2019t that big of a deal, but I think it is important to be precise and introspective about the little things, as it helps form a more informed worldview, especially as we work towards really tackling these deep problems as a society."]}
