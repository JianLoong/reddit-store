When I got back the next morning my girlfriend and I were talking about our days and she said she went out to a bar for drinks with a male friend that had just got out of a relationship. She said it was basically him venting to her about his ex girlfriend who had been cheating on him. It caught me off guard and made me upset that she would go out with another guy and not mention it to me beforehand. I told her I\u2019d prefer she didn\u2019t go out with another guy for drinks, especially if I was out of town. She said that she didn\u2019t think I would think anything of it and didn\u2019t say anything for about 30 minutes after I told her I\u2019d prefer she didn\u2019t go out with another guy for drinks by herself because she was scared I was mad at her. Her reaction and the whole situation made me feel uncomfortable and I\u2019m wondering am I being possessive? We\u2019ve been dating for 11 months and nothing like this has happened before. She has been friends with the guy for about 6-7 years and says that she has never seen him as anything but a friend and before we were dating she said she would go out with him by herself all the time. Am I being an asshole for saying I don\u2019t want her to go out for drinks with a male friend by herself?\n\nMy response after reading comments. After reading responses I am aware I reacted poorly and will apologize. We have never had a disagreement before this and I guess the situation made me feel insecure. \n\nScared is the the wrong word for why she didn\u2019t say much when I said that to her. I adore her and I have never said anything like this before so I think the reason she didn\u2019t say much is because it caught her off guard.", "created_utc": 1695665754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rzjdk/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_dont_want_her_to/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All the more a friend she's had for way longer than you've been in her life. \n\nYou have no right to demand her not see him or \"not for drinks\" or \"not when you're out of town.\" You're not her father nor her keeper.", "YTA\n\nYou're being super possessive, her being friends with a guy and going for a drink with him is not a big deal.\n\nAlso, FYI, if she was into him or doing anything wrong, she wouldn't have told you she was hanging out with him.", "INFO:\n\nShe's wondering what we are all wondering.  What exactly don't you like about it? You've told her you would prefer she not do it, but nowhere in your post do you give an explanation why.\n\nSo:  Why don't you want your gf to go out for drinks with a male friend?", "Yta, lighten up. If you don't she will either dump you or just stop being honest with you and either way, it was because you were being too possessive. You have to trust your partner to make smart decisions.", "YTA. You are being possessive. Your current girlfriend has friends, and she's known them longer than she knows you. And she's already walking on eggshells with you by not hanging out with him since she started dating you. She deserves better.", "YTA\n\nRelationships require trust. I am always baffled by straight people and their tendency to think that its impossible for people of opposite sexes to be friends.", "YTA - trust her (unless she has a history of being untrustworthy) or he single", "YTA, but you're catching yourself since you're feeling possessive. They're friends, they never dated, and it sounds like she's done nothing in your 11-month relationship to give you pause of any kind.", "YTA.  She's been friends with him for 6-7 years, and nothing in the post indicates that anything inappropriate was going on.  \n\nI'm more concerned that you're asking if you're being possessive, and she said she was scared you would be mad at her.  Sounds like there are some control issues going on...", "Yta so sick of reading these posts. What on earth gives you the right to tell your gf who she can and can\u2019t hang out with. Absolutely disgusting", "YTA\n\nYes you are being unreasonable and controlling.", "YTA\n\nPretty fucking controlling, my guy.", "YTA\n\nPeople can have friends of the opposite sex without being attracted to them. People can be alone with a member of the opposite sex who is not their partner without cheating. \n\nYou're being very insecure.", "INFO.\n\nDoes she have a history of infidelity? When she is going out with other friends does she tell you? I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and try to gaslight you by telling you that you're controlling, jealous, possessive, etc without knowing more information about your dynamic. It's entirely possible that your discomfort is warranted.", "YTA, she can have male friends and you should not be attempting to control her.", "NAH\n\nBullshit, follow your gut in how she is behaving.\n\nWhat are the chances that this guy just so happens to break up with his gf at the same time you are out of town thereby necessitating a need to hang out and get drinks last minute? Not likely. \n\nShe waited until you were safely out of town so she could hang out with him. Why? So she could stay out late with him? Perhaps sleep overnight at his house? You wouldn't know what really happened because you weren't there, which is why she planned it while you were out of town.", "I was in a similar situation many years ago when I was younger, and how I reacted (similarly to you) ended up likely being a big factor in that relationship not succeeding in hindsight. My advice is this: it\u2019s not abnormal to feel jealous or even insecure in these scenarios, but ultimately you aren\u2019t helping your relationship by setting these boundaries. If you\u2019re already in an exclusive relationship you should trust your partner not to cheat no matter the scenario they are in, and if not, maybe you aren\u2019t right for each other anyways. I think it\u2019s likely best to apologize.", "YTA she can have male friends and you need to be ok with that. is your relationship so fragile this is actually a problem? if so maybe find a relationship with someone else.", "YTA.

If I were her, I would never tell you anything again because it will just set off another temper tantrum.", "YTA and yes you are being possessive. No one has a right to dictate their partners friends or who they hang out with as friends. This is a red flag and not on.\n\nI\u2019m going to edit to add. If your girlfriend was bisexual/pansexual? Would you stop her from seeing friends that are women too? It seems like you don\u2019t trust her.

She's a grown person who is capable of having platonic friendships. \n\nI mean, really, by your logic, she shouldn't go out for drinks with anyone, ever, because \"that's how affairs start,\" and affairs are not limited by gender. Maybe she'll have drinks with a woman friend and discover she's attracted to her, too.", ">I\u2019m wondering am I being possessive?\n\nYes. Yes you are. YTA", "YTA nothing happened. She went to go comfort a friend after a break up. If there was something nefarious going on, do you think she would have just casually told you? People have got to stop projecting their insecurities onto their partner. This is your problem that you need to work on. Not hers.", "YTA.  They've been friends for a while and he wanted to vent about his breakup.\n\nTwo things disturbed me about this post.\n\n1.  Yes, you are being possessive and controlling.\n2. \"she was scared I was mad at her\"\n\nWhy was she scared?  Do you scare her often?", "YTA. This is controlling and possessive behaviour. This friend has been in her life long before you and will be in her life long after you if you keep this up. You are not allowed to dictate who she can/can't be friends with and vice versa. Apologize to her ASAP.", "YTA. You sound controlling, insecure and jealous. Your girlfriend is allowed to hang out with whoever she wants.", "YTA.\n\nI think it's generally okay to feel uncomfortable about not being in the loop that she was going out drinking with a male friend. I also think you should probably keep those thoughts to yourself and work out why it is that you don't trust your partner.\n\nIf you don't trust her because she's given reason for you not to trust her (either of you have a history with cheating, she's dodgy about the origins of friendships, etc.) then you should talk to her about it. If you realize that you don't have a reason to distrust her, then you need to grow and realize that straight people can be friends with people of the opposite sex without wanting to fuck them.\n\nA lot of people will jump to you're a bad person for even the initial feeling. To me, the problem is you didn't even try to introspect before you made your insecurity her problem. If you have a genuine insecurity about being cheated on (a lot of people do from either past relationships or relationships that have affected their lives), it would be more appropriate to have a conversation with your partner about your insecurity and see about either getting therapy or just healthy ways your relationship can work.\n\nTLDR: Your insecurity is fine, work on it instead of just creating Band-Aid rules that restrict your partner.", "NTA Don't let these Reddit fux gaslight you. It's okay to be concerned. People cheat. All the time. Especially when there is a definite chance of not getting caught. IE: Partner being out of town. \n\nI personally wouldn't put up with it. How would she feel if the roles were reversed?", "YTA. If she were bisexual, would you prevent her from going out with male and female friends? Would you be okay with her insisting that you don't see any friends?\n\nIt's good that you're posting to ask, it shows you're self-aware, but relationships are about trust. You are not her keeper.", "Good on you for being receptive, so many people who post here refuse to even entertain the notion that they could be wrong/TA.", "NTA", "**NAH** because I don\u2019t feel like you were too harsh about the situation but I get where she\u2019s coming from. People have different boundaries their comfortable with for their partner\u2019s interpersonal relationships. I think you guys should just sit down and talk more about the nuance of that and what your *are* comfortable with. \n\nDinner alone? What about a movie? Late night bar trips? A random \u201cline\u201d that comes to mind is that I personally would not want my partner complaining about me or his relationship to a female friend. That\u2019s just so often a recipe for disaster. \n\n\nIf my old boss came through town I\u2019d absolutely meet him for dinner near by to catch up. However, I probably wouldn\u2019t go grab evening drinks sitting bar-side. I\u2019m always conscious of keeping some type of invisible wall that stops the other party from possibly developing feelings whenever possible. \n\nKeep in mind they\u2019ve been friends for quite a long time. I think a *reasonable* ask would be: given the situation, his feelings about his relationship and the state he was in, *coffee* the next day seems a bit more appropriate and a safer (?) option. I think it just comes down to acting in a way that respects your relationship in your partners eyes. Unfortunately, sometimes your idea of what that means won\u2019t align with hers.", "NAH- I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting a heads up if she's going out solo with a dude. It doesn't sound like she meant anything by it or was secretive or defensive about it after, so it's likely just a different view on it all.", "NTA. Personally wouldn\u2019t let that fly", "Soft YTA - I don't want to dismiss your feelings.  Jealousy is only natural.  However, there is zero reason that she can't be friends with the opposite sex, and the same for you.  You've both got to be able to trust each other and be able to have your own friends.  If you can't trust each other and communicate, then there is no hope for your relationship.", "YTA, sorry. They've been friends for 7 years? You're outranked. I'll give you some advice: don't make any ultimatums like that, because you'll likely lose. I have several long-term close women friends, and I watched many boyfriends come and go, along with their jealousies and conditions. I stayed, and they left.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t trust her, then break up. If you say you trust her then actually do it. \n\nYou have a right to your feelings (insecurity, sexism, possessiveness, whatever it is) but you do not have the right to inflict your negativity on her when she\u2019s done nothing wrong.", "Nta! Those kinds of platonic friends later can become hookups or next partners. \n\nThat was a date while you were away. Why are they going out for drinks if they can meet for coffee or a walk? Why didn\u2019t she tell you about it until after? Beware that she doesn\u2019t sleep with him in case he wants to wreck another relationship bc he was cheated on. You might beware. \n\nI trusted friends like that and after I broke up with a partner, I found out there were lunch dates for years and they eventually hooked up. Humans are humans.", "NTA. She shouldn't even want to do this in the first place. It's not about being controlling, but rather about mutual respect and boundaries in a relationship. Going out for drinks alone with a male friend, especially when she knows it could make you uncomfortable, shows a lack of consideration for your feelings", "NTA, yet. So this reminds me of Matt Rife's bit about being friends with a girl you like until she is single again. \n\nBefore people pounce on you, let me just say that what you are feeling is normal. You have feelings for her and you don't want to be hurt. It's about what you do about it. \n\nRemind her that you love her, and that you see your future together, and that ambiguous male friendships can be a hindrance. \n\nBut Christ, be gentle and calm, or you will end up the AH and push her towards him.\n\nEdit: also tell her that guys, especially single guys, interpret that behaviour to mean that she is into them, or at least that she likes him at some level. So, if he's just a friend, treat him like a friend.\n\nAlso, I need to confide that this is exactly how I lost my wife. She fell in love with a friend. He was just waiting until the time was right.", "ESH you for saying that and her for waiting until the next day to say something", "OMFG, the amount of insecurity straight people have around opposite-sex friendships is mind-boggling to me. \n\nYTA", "YTA. They have been friends for a long time and yoyr relationship is new. You don't get to choose your parner's friends and she shouldn't have to ask you can she hang out with someone. I'd think is there something else in your relationship that makes you feel like you can't trust her?", "Question is how would she feel if you did the same thing. We don\u2019t know your dynamic and spoke about this on a earlier post today. In my relationship neither me or my fianc\u00e9 would hang out with the opposite sex by ourselves. But our dynamic is different and we also have children. NTA yet\u2026 but you guys are still very early in the relationship. You have the right to be concerned and vice versa but nothing happened so that\u2019s what matters. You guys should have a talk about your boundaries and mid to long term goals of your relationship.

If she uses Google maps for driving she will likely have the settings to track her whereabouts. It will tell you where she traveled and how long she stayed at that location. \n\nIf her history shows she never went to a bar, dump her ass.\n\nIf her history shows she went to a location that isn't ya'lls place after the bar, dump her ass.", "Because she had no plans, probably because OP was out of town.", "Not just that, she planned to go out with this friend while OP was out of town. Why couldn't she go out with this friend while OP was in town?", "That plus what another user mentioned; it\u2019s about mutual respect, why is she even going out for drinks with a \u201cfriend\u201d whole damn thing seems sus to me.", "Just because she's known her friend for a long time doesn't mean she should disregard your emotions or neglect to communicate with you about her plans. It's not about dictating, it's about discussing boundaries and expectations in a relationship. She is choosing that these drinks are more important than having her bf feel whole and well.", "Well yes I don't disagree but it's weird she wouldn't let him know what she's doing. Maybe I'm the weird one but I'll even let my boyfriend know when I'm going to the store because I like his lil supportive \"you got this babe\" message he always sends when I tell him I'm going shopping.", "I know and you're right. OP's position is really tough because you feel like the rope in a tug of war. But like I replied to your other comment....you have to be open to your partner about something that is bothering you. As long as you do it calmly and with empathy. (BTW, his gf also didn't tell him right away, because she knows it wasn't exactly right. In that context I think OP is not an AH)", "I'm neither poly nor pansexual. Nor am I so insecure in my relationship that I would tell my partner he can't have friendships with other gay men. \n\nBeing this obsessed with whether or not an SO is cheating sounds utterly pathetic.", "Thanks for the advice", "No problem sir I wish you best of luck I\u2019m sure y\u2019all will end up okay \ud83d\ude0a", "I'm sorry but OP's post is not about the ability of his girlfriend to have platonic relationships. It's about OP's right to express his feelings. He's not an AH for communicating to his gf how he feels. What should he do? Bottle it up? Remember he didn't act abusively (yet). I'm sorry we don't see eye to eye but I'm always in favour of full open communication, wherever that may take you.", "You are right. Like many others said, OP's insecurity is an issue, and I am sure that once he reads everything he will work on it (hopefully). Having said that, I still hold my position that OP is not an AH because he opened up about how he feels. I think men should do that more often. I wouldn't want OP to bottle it up and then it explode, and do something he will regret. I think opening up, as a behaviour, especially in men, should be encouraged. Hence, NTA.", "No, we\u2019re not. Didn\u2019t you know?? /sarcasm", "I agree with this 100%, he\u2019s being made to feel like an asshole for questioning his gut although this is a normal thing that happens to couples months in. If OP is serious about the relationship and wants to move forward with this, he needs to communicate, that\u2019s all.", "She can't make plans to spend time with her dear depressed friend while OP is in town? I mean if it was so *bad* why wait, why not go during the week if it was so important?", "[deleted]", "Yeah, no. Not all feelings have to be \"respected\". When a partner feels jealous for no reason and wants to control your behavior despite you giving them no cause to distrust you, no, you don't have to change your behavior to appease their insecurities. \n\nThat's some bullshit.", "If her bf doesn't feel \"whole and well\" unless she's avoiding social settings with half the planet, that's something HE needs to deal with, not her.", ">his gf also didn't tell him right away, because she knows it wasn't exactly right\n\nThis is an assumption. She said she didn't think it would be an issue nor that she should have to tell him beforehand. She did tell him right away, when they met the next day. She just didn't tell him before going. \n\nAssuming that anything you don't tell your partner before doing is because you know is not right, is ridiculous. I didn't tell my husband that I went and ordered myself lunch today instead of making something from our pantry. Does that mean I know it's wrong? Am I hiding it? Nope. I just don't think I need his permission to spend individual money in a meal that I feel like having. If he reacts negatively to this when I tell him --and I'd bet a million dollars he won't-- we'd discuss why and part from there. But it would never mean that I somehow knew I was breaking some rule.", "Your comment has nothing to do with OP's feelings and is implying that someone is likely to have an affair if they have a friend of the opposite sex.", "He can express his feelings within reason.  He does not get to make his feelings her problem.  He is the only one responsible for how he feels and if he cannot handle her having drinks with a longtime friend, that is entirely a HIM problem and he should reflect on that.  \n\nAs for this nonsense about \u201cthis is how affairs start\u201d, that\u2019s absolute bull.  They start all sorts of ways, so unless you can actually back that up, maybe find another straw man argument.", "A feeling can't be \"I don't want you to go out drinking with your friend\", a feeling is \"when you go out drinking with your friend I feel scared/jealous/worried\". A feeling is something that can beget reassurance when expressed. The only way to reassure someone with the former is to comply with their demand, so it's not a feeling. \n\nI'm in a long distance relationship, and my bf and I are both fairly possessive individuals. Still, we both maintain relationships with people of both the same and opposite gender and go out partying or drinking or hanging out, because we have plenty of conversations about our feelings and never hesitate to validate them. We have never once told the other not to hang out with someone because of their gender. And we're both bisexual, so if we started giving into random jealousy we'd each have no friends. It's not a sustainable model. I understand it's easy to feel jealous, sometimes without meaning to; but what you do after is entirely your own.", "Maybe she could have but if she was free then, it shouldn't matter either way.  She might not have thought OP would want to spend their time listening to this guy vent as one of their nights out together.  A free day is a good time to meet with a friend.  It sounds like the friend was going through some personal stuff and the girlfriend and the guy are good friends, not OP, GF and the guy.  It's perfectly normal to want to vent to a good friend but not to just anyone.", "YES\u2026 LIKE HELLO \ud83d\udea8", "you both sound ridiculous. Most of my friends are guys and have had many drinks with them one on one. Never cheated on the guy I was dating. Nothing \"sus\" about it. Calm down lol", "Don't mind them. The comment they're quoting about boundaries was written by a user that 15 min earlier had voted that a woman was the asshole for telling her fianc\u00e9 she would not marry him if he went to a strip club for his bachelor party, after clarifying this was something she never condoned and he was well aware of it for the entirety of their relationship. The same guy who called that girl a controlling person came here to say that OP is not possessive and that this is a normal boundary for him to push ROFL.   \nThey're just incels rubbing each other's...", "I always love hypocrisy so thanks for telling me this lol", "That\u2019s why she waited until OP was out of town?
