Her eating habits were not healthy/normal. She would literally eat a small piece of fruit for breakfast, a little fruit cup for lunch along with taking small bits out of our lunches, and would tell us that for dinner she would eat pasta with sauce. Literally every single night pasta and sauce, nothing different. She'd also make comments to us like \"I have plans later so I can't eat anything today, I don't want to look bloated\", and REFUSED to eat anything if god forbid we were in front of or by boys.

When the food came she started picking off our plates. My friends and I were all visibly annoyed at this as we were all STARVING and just wanted to eat our food in peace. So I finally, in a more serious tone, told her to \"please stop picking at my food, it's getting very annoying\". She got all offended and was like \"ok gosh you don't have to be rude about it\". I told her that I've nicely expressed to her on multiple occasions that she can't expect to always share my food with me. My other friends agreed with me. While I was in the middle of saying this our waiter came to our table and over heard the convo. He was a decently attractive guy. He didn't say or acknowledge anything but Ruby got SOOO embarrassed and stormed out of the restaurant. She texted my friends and I saying we're AH's and horrible friends for embarrassing her and not sharing our food etc. She told other people who's she friends with in out grade HER side of the story who now give us dirty looks whenever they see my friends and I.

One of her most annoying habits is to give a breakdown of what she eats EVERY day, and expect congratulations when she says: \"I only had half an apple and a piece of cheese all day.\".  Second most annoying habit?  To follow that with:. \"Oooo.  That (my food) looks delicious.  I only had ____ to eat today so I can treat myself.\"\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to express concern until I realized that she was thriving off that kind of attention and that was NOT all she was eating.   Now I just completely pretend I don't hear her when she does it.\n\nOver the years I would watch her sneak food (but she's only sneaking because of the lies she tells about what she eats) and  I have found chocolate bars and other junk food stashed everywhere from glove compartments to underwear drawers.    \n\nI think it began for her as a young woman, just like your friend.  And it evolved into a lifestyle of secrets and denial that looks very similar to that of an addict.  She has been significantly overweight for all of her adult life.

Sounds like she worked her weight loss into an an eating disorder.  You need to talk to her parents, a sibling, or even a school counselor (so that they might contact her parents and/or her).", "NTA but like others have said, it sounds like your friend has an eating disorder. She is probably always starving but feels ashamed getting a whole meal for herself so that's why she picks off yours. You should talk to her parents, a teacher, or someone close to her that you trust and try to get her the help that she needs", "NTA. It sounds like Ruby is definitely struggling with her self esteem and probably an eating disorder. You should try to talk to her parents about it, or if you can\u2019t talk to them maybe a trusted teacher. You weren\u2019t in the wrong for asking her to stop picking at your food and it wasn\u2019t your fault the waiter happened to walk by (and I promise you he didn\u2019t care anyways).", "Nta", "Nta but you need to talk to an adult about her eating habits because that is concerning", "NTA \n\nSounds like she has an ED and she\u2019s as well being very blatant about it (as someone who has experience in that area) Most hide it very deliberately and carefully, so it may be her desperate cry for help by being so overt with her disordered behaviours", "NTA but like many people have said, this frankly sounds like an eating disorder. Her thoughts may be that she doesn\u2019t allow herself to eat food, but it doesn\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d if she snacks on other people\u2019s food. Buying her own would be some sort of weakness/failing. You are totally right that you shouldn\u2019t have to share food, but please take some time to gently address her food issues, and if she has safe/good parents, please tell them as well. This sounds like it runs much deeper.", "NTA but I don't think she's doing this on purpose or to spite you. \nShe may be scared if she orders a meal or side she will eat it all which sounds ridiculous but as someone who had an ED for over 10 years that would derail my whole day and might possibly start a spiral for a week or more. \nIt's not OK that you have to deal with the behaviours of her disorder but it is important to know it isn't vindictive on her part and she's likely super embarrassed that she annoyed you and drew attention to her eating. \nHer self esteem is low and she needs help. Her parents need to help her and kmow whats actually going on and get her professional help. This isn't on you and your friends to be burdened with but if she chooses to fight it she may need your support. \nI think of all the shit I did with an ED and feel like it's watching an insane animal but brains will do as they please with trauma!", "NTA.  Charge her for each bite she wants. Her parents give her lunch money. What does she spend it on? No money, no bites. Tell her mom she skips lunch and mooches bites from everyone else. Let her go from there.", "NTA,  you are under no obligation to share your food. If Ruby has money she is choosing to not order and therefore not entitled to eating from your plate."]}
