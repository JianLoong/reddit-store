She's also apparently one of those super-judgmental religious assholes, which never helps.", "NTA \u2014 Its your decision to keep something YOU bought for yourself. Giving away other people\u2019s stuff without consent is never right in my opinion. You have the rights to feel angry since i understand how it must feel when you cannot afford yourself to always enjoy such things. \nAlso, her being pretty childish about it and blaming you for not being okay is making you even more innocent. Especially using religion and then refusing to talk to your child and being stubborn is also considered a sin, so she can\u2019t make a clear point on that. \nOverall, you are in the right.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your stuff. You bought it for yourself.\n\nIt's one thing if you are doing well and have tons to share, but nobody wants to be sacrificing for small luxuries and then waking up to see they're gone.\n\nShe's trying to impress these kids by taking advantage of you, and then she's gaslighting you by playing the saint. You never agreed to play the saint and that's not something you should be expected to do.", "Nta, pretty sure stealing is a sin.", "Your mom is a hyppocrite because she's the selfish one. She shared someone else's snacks with children instead of her own stuff. Stealing is also a sin.", "NTA.  Tell your mother that theft is a sin and she is a thief for stealing your property.  Demand full payment from her to replace what she stole.", "NTA \n\nOk. Then next time do the same thing when you have guests with her expensive things. Because Jesus did say in Matthew 7:12: \n\n*All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them.
