I didn't try to support my Dad and talk through it with him, I simply made him believe that his GF, who I saw and heard of multiple occasions abusing him, was in fact abusing him and he needed to break it off with her. I had many long talks with him about her, but I didn't see them breaking up in the future, so I took it into my own hands.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The GF did the rest.\n\nThat's not gaslighting.  That's showing him reason.", "Was she extra \"friendly\" around pay days? Just wondering.", "He shouldn't like what she was doing, it was manipulating him and emotional abuse on her part.\n\nNTA.  Ever think he didn't like what she was doing but just shrugged it off. You just confirmed his feelings on the matter.   He is much better without someone like that in his life.", "Im really leaning toward NTA. \n\nShe sounded controlling and not the nicest person so yeah, I understand giving the ultimatum. \n\nJust the gaslighting is what makes me wanna say you\u2019re a bit of an AH for. \n\nYou were just looking out for your dad though and in the long run hopefully he\u2019ll see that.", "INFO: I\u2019m a little confused - how exactly did you gaslight him?", "NTA.  *It doesn't matter what you would have said, any father worth his salt would never rise to her ultimatum.*  My father loved my mother with all of his heart and still does, even though she's been dead for over ten years.  But he's told me more than once that if he had to choose between my Mom and me, he would pick me every time.", "NTA.\n\nAll you did was help him see her true colors. You may have exaggerated when she said, but you probably conveyed the right feelings. She wanted to leech if your dad for her and her family while kicking his to the curb.\n\nYou protected him, yourself, and any family dynamic he has. Next step would have certainly been making sure he had NC with any siblings, parents, etc..\n\nAnd telling him ue had no choice in bringing her mom breakfast? Even if his ankle was fine, that's unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nand you were absolutely not in any way shape or form 'gaslighting' him.", "NTA at all.\n\nBUT gaslighting is trying to convince someone that they're mentally unwell and can't trust their own sense of reality. \n\nWhat you did was just convince him of a different point of view.", "NTA. She sounds quite abusive. It also sounds like your dad wasn't seeing that. You simply showed him the truth. I can guarantee her behavior would have gotten worse and more abusive if she was allowed to continue with that. Thank you for protecting your dad.", "NTA\n\nYou just saved your dad from a horrible relationship and a lifetime of suffering.  Perhaps this is wrong of me, but I honestly don't care how you did it.  Bravo!", "NTA\n\nYou were protecting his sanity, his health and from the sound of it his money.  This sounds like a \"love scam\" by the way.  If I were Dad, I would check to see if his identity has been used for credit cards and what not.", "ESH, except your dad. Looking at your description of how you gaslighted him in the comments, you were manipulating him, just like she was.

Be glad she's gone. She sounds like a nightmare. You'd have been shoved out of his life in a very short while.", "NTA.\n\nWhat you did is not gaslighting. You did what I wished someone would have done when I was with my manipulative ex. You helped your dad see that what his ex was doing was wrong and hurting him.", "She says she doesn\u2019t like American food. Lady you\u2019re in America!!!! NTA OP.", "NTA\n\nGas lighting is muuuuuch more involved than just telling someone over and over they don't feel a certain way about something, and generally involves more an attempt to convince them that they can't actually trust their own senses. Your father was putting up with that behaviour, but no doubt he didn't really care for it. Having someone repeatedly remind him that it was behaviour he didn't care for, and was prevalent, just stopped him from putting it to the back of his mind the same way we all put things we don't wanna cause waves over off. If anything, he was probably closer to gaslighting himself, because he likely was also thinking, \"you're stupid, that's not abuse, and even if it were you're a man so you can take it.\"", "Exactly. \"I convinced him he didn't like her behavior\" sounds a lot more like \"I pointed out what was wrong with her behavior and encouraged him to see it for what it was,\" which is a good thing to do when someone is dealing with a toxic person and doesn't realize it themselves. I don't even know how OP could theoretically gaslight him into not liking the gf, based on the actual definition of the word.", "What ex- gf was doing was gas lighting.  NTA in any way.", "Yeah. She was \ud83d\ude11\n\nShe pressured him into spending his overtime money (which he was getting to put down a down payment on a house) on a weekend trip to Galveston. She made him cancel his plans with me and blew a few grand of his savings that weekend.\n\nAlso forced him into fixing a bunch of random junk around her house and would get mad when it took \"too long\" then made him hire people to finish the various jobs.", "So he would call me on his way home from work and we would talk about things that she said to him. If I saw on him the weekend, I would purposefully over exaggerate both what she said and his response and twist her words.\n\nSo for example, because of their language barrier, I could read her text messages (the ones that he specifically showed me, I never did this without permission) and twist her words to make it seem a lot worse than it was. \n\nOne time he hurt his ankle at work and couldn't see her because he didn't want to drive. She said during their argument that she needed him to pick up breakfast for her mom and he didn't have a choice, I convinced him that she was using him and manipulating him to come over so that they could argue in person.\n\nIn another instance there was a controversy over my Dad looking for a new house. She said that she would like her brother and his wife to move in but that my sister and I could only be visitors. I convinced him that she really meant that we wouldn't be able to stay there if we needed help (which was his point of moving in the first place)\n\nI don't think gaslighting may be the right term, but I convinced him through exaggerating both his reactions and her words that she was being more aggressive than she actually was. I 100% do believe that she was abusing him though, so I felt by any means I needed to get my Dad away from her. I hope that gives you a better picture of what I mean by gaslighting.", "Yeah. This isn't some Wormtongue shit. This is OP probably vocalizing the issues in a questioning manner. Which is what you gotta do sometimes for those you love.", "Yeah. That's not gaslighting him, you just helped him see what she was really like. NTA", "This is why people need to stop using \"gaslighting\" so loosely. None of what you did is gaslighting. And you helped him get out of an abusive situation.", "Honestly, while technically slightly manipulative, this doesn't strike me as gaslighting. You said she was already telling your dad to avoid you and isolating him from you, so frankly, it's reasonable to think she wouldn't let you stay at his new house. And it sounds like she does pick fights with him when he says he can't see her, so telling him that's what's probably going to happen if he goes while his ankle is hurt makes sense. You're using her own behavior to make an educated guess of what you think is going to happen, which isn't gaslighting.", "Give your dad a little credit, at 55 maybe he managed to see this didn\u2019t go anywhere himself as well? Don\u2019t think he did this just because of your \u2018manipulations\u2019. Though you probably helped him see how this would affect your relationship. NTA.", "Whew, I haven't seen a honest to goodness justified a-h post in a while.", "Well, he has always been one of those incredibly friendly people who will do anything he can to help anyone. Very much a \"why would anyone want to hurt me?\" Type of person. Especially family and friends. About 3ish years ago he was put on a cholesterol medication and even though he stopped taking it, he really hasn't been 100% since. And it really magnified his already naive/gullible personality.\n\nI kid you not when I asked him if he thought she loved him, he said they were soulmates. That was last October. When I first asked him about the texting issues, he said \"that's just how she likes to communicate,\" so I don't think he saw any of this as problematic at all. He was incredibly resistant to my concerns at first, which is why I believe I did gaslight him.", "NTA all you did was open his eyes to the reality of the situation, which was unhealthy for him, and would have only gotten worse.", "NTA\n\nShe was a parasite.", "I was furious with her \"you're too fat\" comments to him, but when she said that my heart dropped I don't think I have cried over a situation that much in a long time. He smoked that brisket for 26 hours. She didn't even take a bite. It's probably one of the most disrespectful things to do to in my family (or in Texas for that matter)", "Look, I believe you're acting in your dad's best interests and it's hard to fault you for that.  I'm troubled by the use of the word \"gaslighting\" because it suggests there's deception involved.  \n\nDid you have to deceive your father into seeing this person for who she is? \n\nIt doesn't make you the AH.  But it does define the limits you going to.  Can your father understand how this person is treating him vs do you have to employ deception?   \n\nOnce your father sees the light, HE may feel shame...  and perceive deception on your part to be an AH move.  (Because of his own embarrassment).\n\nYou won't be wrong for caring about your father, but it's something to look out for.  Good luck OP.", "Thank you, and that's a firm yes. As long as I didn't lose him permanently, I didn't care what lengths I had to go to. I deceived him and he did not understand in the slightest."]}
