I believe she had been throwing herself around the bed and not realizing she had hit herself on the bed frame in the process. there were multiple and some even very red and discolored. I was unsure of what to do as head injuries can be pretty serious if not dealt with quickly, even leading to death. I tried communicating with her we needed to go to the hospital to get those checked out.

Those welts or bumps could've also been indication of an allergic reaction, maybe not to the shrooms, but something else, who knows?\n\nI'm a little more concerned with her trying to flip your concern for her well being into a consent  and savior thing; especially just when the bill came.

There\u2019s a way to take (certain) drugs responsibly and she appears to be too immature to do that. \n\nWhy is she throwing herself on the bed to the point she is getting huge bruises? Da fuck is going on?\n\nAlso her saying that it isn\u2019t okay for you to help when she\u2019s on drugs and just because you live in a shared space doesn\u2019t mean you can? You live in a shared space and if she\u2019s going to trip and do drugs in the shared space, she should get consent from you that you are okay with that going on in your shared space.

She was not communicating with you so you could not ask what happened or get her to the hospital without help. \n\nShe did the mushrooms alone which is her choice but very irresponsible .

You did the right thing. There is an acceptable response in a situation with a non-verbal person under the influence. I am a regular user of legal cannabis and even if I'm used to it, I won't do it alone. There is always a risk for any narcotic. Even for seasoned recreational users. Better to have EMTs and other medical professionals assess than to assume the risk of \"nothing is wrong\".", "NTA - You don't have enough knowledge to know if she is \"ok\" or not.\n\nAnd in that case, you play on the safe side.", "NTA she was tripping off her tits to the point of being nonverbal and then got annoyed with you being concerned about her wellbeing?!

All the comments saying you\u2019re the AH are wild. Her trip experience is not worth her life.

If she had a major head injury she would be thanking you.  too often people don't act and things end horribly.", "NTA. \n\nIf she were still able to talk and understand the situation, I\u2019d say you might be an AH (if she were to actively refuse help and insist she was fine). That being said, she was tripping so hard that she couldn\u2019t even speak or comprehend what was going on. That\u2019s insane. That could *absolutely* be a sign that something was wrong, and she clearly did not dose herself properly.\n\nI work in healthcare, and I would\u2019ve done the same thing in your position.", "NTA. You had good reason to be concerned. Although calling the paramedics may have been a little much. You could have taken her to the ER yourself or even an urgent care clinic. Still, you were doing the right thing to get her medical attention. Of bigger concern is the fact that her drug use is clearly leading to physical harm. That's a sure sign it has gone too far.", "NTA\n\nBut the \\*only\\* reason I'm going with NTA is my assuming that it is true she was actually \"nonverbal\". At that point, you don't know if it's a massive amount of shrooms or a bad brain bleed or what causing the non-verbal behavior. (If she actually was verbal, I'd have the complete opposite reaction)\n\nIn general, I'd be furious if someone called 911 on me without my permission. But then, despite being absolutely wild decades ago in my youth, I've never managed to get to the point of rendering myself non-verbal. And I mean...    that's up to 8.5g good dried shrooms on an empty stomach and other things riding on top. (Decades ago, that is). I have to wonder just how much she ate.\n\nIt's basically your call at this point. She doesn't want you summoning help on her behalf even if she can't gargle out at least one coherent sentence, and you don't want her dying in front of you because you didn't.", "NTA head injuries are not a joke. You were worried.  Also if she would have waited for you to come home then she would not have been in this predicament.", "NTA. And its not worth being in a relationship with someone this stupid and irresponsible", "That sounds like something other than, or in addition to, mushrooms tbh. NTA since head injuries are such a serious thing. \n\nBut I\u2019ve never been around anyone who was ONLY on psilocybin get so far gone as to hurl themselves around and be unresponsive.", "NAH\n\nYou freaked out and cost her $1000's and she seems to have responded by setting a new firm boundary.\n\nRespect it or break up and move out \n\nEither you are comfortable with her use of psychedelics or you aren't.\n\nYou are a bit of a drama queen.", "She\u2019s an adult making adult choices for herself. If she had asked you to be the \u201ctrip sitter\u201d it would be different. She chose to trip alone, she chose not to go to the hospital, you didn\u2019t listen.\n\nYTA", "Have you ever taken mushrooms before?  She understood you, she just didn't want you to kill her buzz.\n\nKill her buzz you did.\n\nEdit changed with details.", "YTA\n\nI exclusively trip on my own, outside interference from other people just leads to a less profound experience.\n\nI'm kind of wondering what kind of people you know and how they act that makes you so worried.\n\nI grow my own golden teachers, I'm at about 5 grams dry weight dosage these days. I have never seen anyone that I've given these to go insane. Hell I've been lucid enough to go buy snacks from a Walmart.\n\nYou put her in an incredibly uncomfortable position and cost her money because of your insecurities about drugs.\n\nYou still feel pain on mushrooms, she probably understood just fine and didn't want to go, you're just allowing your disdain for what she did to cloud what happened.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
