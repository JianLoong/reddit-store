{"id": 26811, "submission_id": "16hti67", "title": "AITA for not wanting to babysit my friends child overnights and not connecting them with my babysitter?", "selftext": "I (33F) have a friend (34F), we can call her \"Nina\". I am married, 2 kids, ages 4 and 3. Nina is a single mother, one child, 2 yrs old. Nina has a hard time being a single mother. She frequently reaches out to her circle to help babysit so she can have breaks. These breaks are often overnight breaks. Her mother helps a lot with these overnights during the week and on weekends so Nina can \"have her own life\". \n\nRecently, Nina asked me if I could connect her with my babysitter for possibly an overnight. I told her I was uncomfortable with that. I didn't get to fully express my reasons because she blew up at me and called me judgemental. My reasons are the following: Nina lives in an unsafe neighborhood (the neighbor across the street is creepy and spy's on her. And her apartment is infested with rats. The landlords (her mother and step-father) seem to have no interest in taking care of the rat infestation; it's been over 2 years with the rats. I would recommend my babysitter (17F), but I wouldn't recommend my friend in her current living situation. \n\nThe argument then turned into how Nina feels I am not willing to help her in her \"situation\". It always comes back to her situation (single mom, dead-beat baby daddy). i have babysat a few times, for a few hours each. She has asked me multiple times to baby sit overnight, all of which I said no, one being over the 4th of July long weekend. It's not something I am willing to do. She then turned it into how willing she is to babysit my kids and other peoples kids, and how it is a give/take relationship and that's called \"community\". I didn't respond to her last message because it my opinion it has nothing to do with community and everything to do with boundaries. \n\nAITA? I don't think we are friends anymore, but I keep brooding over this, it's been about 2 weeks since either one of us have spoken to each other. It's upsetting, but I think I can move on without her if she is going to guilt trip and try to manipulate me.

You have it for business purposes only, not give out to people the babysitter doesn't know.  You could have asked the babysitter if she'd be interested first.  However, by doing this you're implicitly saying you recommend this person as a potential client for her.  Even if you gave her warnings and said you don't think she should I can easily see a teenager thinking \"but why would OP mention this if it wasn't a good idea?\"\n\nIf you haven't you need to report Nina's living situation to whoever handles children services (like CPS in the US).  Rat infestations are dangerous.  They can carry diseases and I can only imagine how bad the house is.  This isn't safe for anyone.  As an adult Nina can make the decision to stay in unsafe/unsanitary conditions.  But her minor children can't.  Someone needs to step in and get them to a safe living situation.", "NTA.
