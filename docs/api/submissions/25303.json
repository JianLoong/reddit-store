{"id": 25303, "submission_id": "15yiqwm", "title": "AITA for asking my friend\u2019s girlfriend if she had a problem with our sexual past?", "selftext": "Back in 2020, I started hanging out and hooking up a guy who lives in my neighborhood after we met via Tinder. It lasted for about 6 months, until I noticed a shift in his interest towards romantic and sexual activities, asked him about it and we decided to keep it friendly. We went a few months without seeing each other until I messaged him to hang out as friends, it was fun and we both felt comfortable so we\u2019ve been meeting every other month for dinner or drinks as friends ever since. There has been no sexual nor romantic advances on either part in all that time, we truly are just friends. A year and a half ago he started dating a girl about 9 years younger than us (we\u2019re both 33, she\u2019s 24) and when he first told me about her I suggested perhaps we should stop hanging out. He said she didn\u2019t have a problem with it since we\u2019re just friends and she\u2019s understanding and chill and seemed weirded out that I would suggest that. I honestly just didn\u2019t want her to feel uncomfortable or threatened by our friendship and wanted my friend and her to work out, that was all. \n\nI had not met her until just a few days ago. My friend invited me to one of his band\u2019s concerts and his gf was there too, apparently she had suggested him inviting me since I had never been to one of their concerts. We chatted for a bit while he packed his drumset. She is pretty and seems nice enough. I then asked her whether she had a problem with me being friends with her bf due to us having dated in the past. She suddenly turned serious and said: \u201cI will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you\u2019re bringing this up with good intention, but to be honest, that is between my boyfriend and I and I don\u2019t have a need to discuss your sexual past with you\u201d. I thought that response was excessive and uncalled for and a telltale sign that she is indeed insecure about our friendship. I had dinner with my friend today and he said his gf told him about the incident and said that she believes I still have romantic feelings for him, however she doesn\u2019t care whether we remain friends because he trusts him. He seemed a little bit uncomfortable about the situation and suggested it was inappropriate of me to make that question to his gf. I think she\u2019s immature and insecure but won\u2019t tell him that.", "created_utc": 1692738677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yiqwm/aita_for_asking_my_friends_girlfriend_if_she_had/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was absolutely NO reason to ask that, except to parade in her face that you\u2019re still friends with him.

That's an invasive question to ask a complete stranger and you're reading into it way too much. Take her answer at face value", "YTA. You made it weird. You were intrusive. Apologize and move forward.", "YTA it honestly sounds like you brought it up to get a rise out of her, which is extremely immature. If she had been treating you rudely before hand and you genuinely wanted to know if she had a problem with you. I would get that. This however is just petty and is genuinely none of your business. It very much just sounds like you're jealous he has a younger pretty girl. Do better and don't be so insecure that you have to remind a girl you screwed her man because that's basically all you did.", "YTA. It seems like you are trying to make this uncomfortable, tbh. Are you sure you don\u2019t have feelings for him? \n\nNothing needed to be said. You made it weird. I\u2019d apologise and say your heart was in the right place but your brain and mouth weren\u2019t. Then move on, and never mention it again.", "YTA, for the exact reason she stated.\n\nEdit: also, your comments below make it clear that you don't approve of the relationship because of an age difference. You're acting in bad faith.", "YTA, that's a bullshit question to ask. She tried to be cool,  you acted like trash.  You're also TA for how childish your responses have been.", "YTA\n\nThere was no reason for you to bring this up.", "YTA\n\nThat question definitely comes off as if YOU are not okay with their relationship.", "YTA - For your disgusting and degrading comment about her being his \u201clittle lap dog\u201d when she goes to his concerts. Very clear how you see her.", "Why don\u2019t you care that I fucked your boyfriend?\n\n\nDo you understand now why that sounds fucked up?", "YTA\n\nIf you are truly just friends, and the friend said he spoke to his GF about you already -- there was no reason for you to bring it up with her. It's almost like you want to be the gatekeeper here. \n\nBy bringing it up directly with her, you put her in an awkward position -- and frankly, her answer is about as good as anybody could hope for in that position. If anything, you come across as the immature and insecure one here.", "YTA and your putting off very jealous vibes. It seems like you were actively driving a wedge between them. Maybe it wasn\u2019t intentional and had no ill will but that is definitely how it comes off.", "YTA, she\u2019s better than I am that\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say lmao", "Lol you thought you had more importance in his life than you did. You wanted her to feel to feel insecure but when she didn\u2019t you were taken back. Good for her. What she said was not rude but matter of fact and she put you in your place. \n\nEither you thought she didn\u2019t know or you wanted her to be mad. She is more immature than you are. She knows he doesn\u2019t look at you like that so she has nothing to worry about.", "it's so embarrassing when grown ass people still are pick me's\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d leave that stuff in high school\nYTA", "YTA but hear me out. \n\nFirst, why make a post asking for opinions on your behavior then refuse to see where everyone is coming from lol. Stop being so defensive and try to not take what they're saying in a bad way. You asked, people are answering \n\nNow, I will admit that when I was younger, I mostly had guy friends. And even if I had no intentions to make a friendship into something more (and yes some I did sleep with in the past) I liked it when their gf's were threatened by me because it made me feel like I was obviously better than them. *I am not proud of this behavior but I'm being honest*\n\nAnd if someone would've asked me if I was jealous, threatened, wanting to be with that guy, I would have said absolutely not and meant it (or so I thought) and I hated it when a girl seemed totally fine with me being friends with the guy...basically no matter the girl and how she was, I was the problem. I had to realize that about myself. Even when I didn't think I was being shitty to them, I was. \n\nSo you might not actually want a relationship with him, but maybe the fact that she seemed so comfortable with you and him as friends made you feel some type of way. Cause truly, there was no reason to ask her what you asked her! None. At all. You did it to get a reaction out of her. \n\nI'm not attacking you, but you created this problem. And you need to really try to figure out why you created this problem and be honest with yourself. And you owe her an apology.", "YTA, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you\u2026", "YTA.

I can't imagine a circumstance where it wouldn't be weird for you to bring that up, unless she had brought it up. \n\nHer response was not at all indicative of insecurity. In fact, it was perfectly reasonable and well-articulated. What's even more confusing is that your friend had literally already told you his partner was okay with you two remaining friends.

You seem to have issues with every single thing she says and it\u2019s interesting that her comments are broadly generic and polite (like her saying he speaks fondly of you), and yet you call it condescending. She doesn\u2019t know you. You are acquaintances AT BEST. She is being polite. I think you need to take some time to reevaluate how you actually feel about this man and if it\u2019s worth continuing your \u201cfriendship\u201d with him.", "YTA, you made it weird, she is right", "Just wanted to add, you are insanely jealous. Move on, he isn\u2019t into you", "Yta, tbh. Her suggesting he invite you to the concert and being generally friendly towards you would be enough for most people to realize that she is chill about the situation. If it *did* bother her, what was she supposed to say? \"Yes stop being friends with him\" and make herself look controlling?
