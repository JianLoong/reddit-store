{"id": 22849, "submission_id": "1569mha", "title": "AITA for Refusing to Attend My Best Friend's Wedding Because I Wasn't Chosen as the Maid of Honor?", "selftext": "I (26F) have been best friends with Jane (27F) since 5th grade. We've always been inseparable, and I considered her my closest friend. Recently, Jane got engaged to her long-term bf, and I was thrilled for her. As her best friend, I naturally assumed I would be chosen as the MOH for her wedding.\n\nHowever, when she announced her wedding party, she picked her cousin instead of me. I was (and still  am!) deeply hurt and couldn't hide my disappointment. I was shocked and devastated that she didn't choose me as the MOH. I confronted her privately and asked her why she didn't pick me, especially considering our history and how much I've supported her throughout the years. Jane told me that her cousin, who lives far away and whom she rarely sees, needed this opportunity to bond with the family. I told her that if she couldn't see how much I deserved to be her MOH, then I didn't want to be a part of her wedding at all. I even threatened not to attend the wedding altogether, just to get my point across. Well, this didn't work to my favor.\n\nShe told me I was no longer a bridesmaid and could attend as a guest if I decided to end my \"pity party.\" This offended me, admittedly more than it should have. I said some less-than-kind things. This little tiff between us caused her to ban me from the wedding altogether.\n\nPeople have been blowing up my phone calling me selfish, entitled, and a bad friend for trying to make Jane's big day all about me and my hurt feelings. All that \"true friends would \\[this that and the other\\]\" I think I have a right to be upset. I've busted my a\\*\\* as her friend, and I feel like she threw me away. She asked me to meet her on Sunday morning for breakfast and to try to talk it out. I don't want to pretend I think I'm wrong if I wasn't. I need some insight. So: AITA for being upset that I am not my close friend's MOH?\n\nEDIT: Since I'm getting grilled, maybe it's important to clarify some things.\n\nShe went way further than I did with her comments. I made a couple low blows, but nothing compared to her telling me I wasn't being a friend. I've done a lot for her, and I accepted her fianc\u00e9 into our life even though he\u00b4s a giant red flag (the biggest being trying to cut her off from me so she had no one to go to), and she had the gall to tell me I wasn't enough of a friend. I've put up with a lot from her.\n\nNo, I don't hate her cousin. She's nice enough, I think. She just isn't MOH material. They're not that close, she still has to be monitored after being taken off of chemo (meaning less time dedicated to the wedding), and she doesn't live close by. I don't want this to sound shallow, but honestly she draws a lot of attention. She's beautiful, but she's lost a lot of weight (kind of skeleton-ish, not in a body shaming way) and her hair is pretty clumpy. I just don't think she deserves it more than I do.\n\nIf she wanted a family member for MOH, she should have picked one of her sisters or other cousins. Picking someone she doesn't know that well anymore felt deliberately offensive towards me (and honestly to every other MOH candidate in her life)", "created_utc": 1689998802, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1569mha/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_best_friends/", "score": 271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound incredibly immature and self-centered, and your edit is just downright nasty. The woman just had chemo and her cousin is choosing to honor and include her in the wedding.

Your forced an ultimatum, and it backfired. \n\nYou did gain some valuable information:\n\nYou aren\u2019t as important to her as she is to you. \n\nIf you want to write her off forever, go ahead.

It went a bit far. You obviously considered her a close friend, but she did not share the same sentiments. It sounds like she wanted to do something nice for a cousin (family) who had been ill. Don't be surprised when people choose family over friends.", "ESH, not just you. In this situation, I would feel incredibly hurt too, especially since the cousin doesn\u2019t have a deep relationship with your friend, doesn\u2019t live nearby, and seems like she\u2019ll be unable to significantly help with moh duties due to health reasons (requiring you, as a bridesmaid, to step up without the recognition). \n\nI think your friend is an AH because she dismissed your feelings when you were being vulnerable and was a gossip and shared your argument with everyone. The loose lips, for me, would alone significantly lower my trust in the friendship. \n\nI think you are also an AH, though, because the attempt to manipulate by giving an ultimatum was an asshole move and the hurtful comments were unnecessary. Instead, you should have gracefully shared your feelings, declined any requests to help out with moh duties (if the cousin couldn\u2019t), attended the wedding as a bridesmaid, and then considered scaling back the friendship because she obviously doesn\u2019t hold you in the same position in her life as you do her.", "All you \u201cdeserve\u201d is to be kicked to the curb.  YTA", "Girl, here\u2019s the deal: IT\u2019S HER WEDDING. If she wants a stranger off the street to be her MOH, you support her. I get it. It can hurt. This is how be a good friend in the situation - you tell her you understand, that she\u2019s trying to make her cousin, who has had a pretty rough few years, feel special. You help her with the MOH duties and in your friend\u2019s wedding day, she experiences joy and is happy that she gets to share her wedding with the people that are most important to her, knowing that you did the MOH duties and helped make that day special but you supported her decision. As her \u201cbest friend,\u201d wouldn\u2019t you want that for her? Again, I get that it hurts - I\u2019ve been in that situation, but at the end of the day IT\u2019S NOT ABOUT YOU. YTA.\n\nI am curious though, what other red flags did her fianc\u00e9 show other than trying to separate you too? Also did she give a reason as to why he tried to do that?", "YTA \n\nHer wedding, her decision. And supporting her relationship with a controlling AH trying to isolate her doesn\u2019t make you a good friend.

How do you not see that. YTA.", "Lol, YTA. Surely you can see this. You sound like a terrible friend if you are honestly considering boycotting the wedding over this. You are not owed MOH duty. Stop making this about yourself", "YTA.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: she didn\u2019t choose her cousin because she \u2018needs the opportunity to bond with the family\u2019. She chose her cousin because she knew you would be an actual nightmare as maid of honor and make everything in her wedding about you.

Not only that, but you're picking apart the fact that she's gone through chemo, CHEMO, and it's affected her appearance. Newsflash chemo fucking sucks, and your description of her is fucking shallow as hell!! \n\nYou need to do some serious self reflection if you think being friends with others is some sort of job you have to \"bust your ass\" at, and entitles you to anything of someone elses.

So, guess who would likely have been 'acting MOH' if she hadn't acted like a selfish brat? Maybe the bestest buddy bridesmaid? The fact Jane even still wants to meet and talk means you might be able to fix this. Apologize, explain *calmly* how hurt you were, and that you felt discarded and devalued as a friend.

We've always been inseparable, and I considered her my closest friend. Recently, Jane got engaged to her long-term bf, and I was thrilled for her. As her best friend, I naturally assumed I would be chosen as the MOH for her wedding.\n\nHowever, when she announced her wedding party, she picked her cousin instead of me. I was (and still  am!) deeply hurt and couldn't hide my disappointment. I was shocked and devastated that she didn't choose me as the MOH. I confronted her privately and asked her why she didn't pick me, especially considering our history and how much I've supported her throughout the years. Jane told me that her cousin, who lives far away and whom she rarely sees, needed this opportunity to bond with the family. I told her that if she couldn't see how much I deserved to be her MOH, then I didn't want to be a part of her wedding at all. I even threatened not to attend the wedding altogether, just to get my point across. Well, this didn't work to my favor.\n\nShe told me I was no longer a bridesmaid and could attend as a guest if I decided to end my \"pity party.\" This offended me, admittedly more than it should have. I said some less-than-kind things. This little tiff between us caused her to ban me from the wedding altogether.\n\nPeople have been blowing up my phone calling me selfish, entitled, and a bad friend for trying to make Jane's big day all about me and my hurt feelings. All that \"true friends would \\[this that and the other\\]\" I think I have a right to be upset. I've busted my a\\*\\* as her friend, and I feel like she threw me away. She asked me to meet her on Sunday morning for breakfast and to try to talk it out. I don't want to pretend I think I'm wrong if I wasn't. I need some insight.

In fact, I\u2019d say the only issue with the wedding was her parents\u2019 recent divorce (that they hid from the priest until it was over) which meant her dad tried hitting on all the unrelated bridesmaids, including me. That was 27 years ago and I\u2019m still skeeved out by his behavior. \n\nWhen she got divorced and then remarried to her current husband, she asked if I wanted to be her MOH.

You are no best friend, you are a bitter, old, lonely, single, jealous, insecure, outrageously controlling, mental person, and an asshole through and through. Your parents did nothing to raise you right in any way. You made it all about you, you created drama when there was none, you are a pitiful excuse for a human, and a best friend. You are absurdly shallow, beyond belief. Throwing a young girl's chemo out there as a reason for not to be MOH? Criticizing her for being skinny and not to your body standards? You are the exact dirty cloth that shallow and body shaming behavior comes from. Who are you to be shaming another woman like this when she's done absolutely nothing to YOU?!!! You are nobody to decide what MOH standards are, it's not your wedding, not that you'll ever have one with your shitty behavior, and not unless you get some poor ass sucker to fall for your horrid self. Of course your friend said some not so nice things, but you hit so below the belt, you might as well have been trying to take her body out from under her, you are a horrible friend and a huge disaster of a person, honestly. Lots of people even pick their sisters over their best friends, their best friends over their sisters, and even a coworker over all of them, and you don't normally see someone as awful as you trying to tear every woman down in your path. You are throwing a massive tantrom because you aren't getting your way, you spoiled, asshole, entitled, unbearable, bitter, lonely, future cat lady brat! If the fiance's a red flag, I'm tempted to not believe it because it honestly just sounds like you are so lonely and miserable that you have to try and bring your supposed best friend down with you. You petulant child. If he's a red flag, let her find out, but the last thing I'd be doing if I was her is taking any advice from you, even if I had a gun to my head. Stop making it all about yourself and enjoy sitting at home with your boxed wine knowing you aren't at the wedding of your supposed best friend because you couldn't keep your petti, shallow, bitter, lonely, miserable, and asshole mouth shut and stupid thoughts to yourself.

Think about where this neediness of the bride could be coming from. Maybe google 'the abandonment life trap'.\n\nWould your friend see the situation as you having 'done everything for the friendship'? Perhaps what happened with the fianc\u00e9 was that when they met, he was able to provide some much-needed insight that she needed to lay down some boundaries with you, and this was a caring act- not him trying to isolate her, but to protect her. My husband helped me do that with my sisters when we first met and I'll always thank him for that.\n\nNobody said the cousin was more special. The fact is, her family, including the cousin, is very important to her. I can easily understand giving someone such a nice thing as being MOH if they're in your family and have suffered so much.", "get to therapy. im not even joking or being snarky. how are you an adult with a friend getting married (so presumably at least mid twenties and upon average) and making your friends wedding about your own desire to be \u2018special\u2019", "Nah, 12 year old knows better.. Even 5 yrs old knows better..", "the part that gets me is the clumpy hair comment and the \"skeleton like\" comment directly subsequent to 'oh, and she just finished chemo.'

But I kinda don't think anyone can be that awful, so I think its fake (while knowing ive met people 100x worse than this irl).", "she doesn't owe you an apology", "She doesn\u2019t belong to you. She\u2019s an entire person separate from you. Therefore he can\u2019t take her away from you.

My older sister once (at 16yo) repeatedly slammed my head into the floor while screaming \"WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME?!??!\" over and over because I didn't want to watch a movie with her. Not even the worst thing she ever did but if you asked her I was a horrible unsupportive sister and it's 100% my fault we never had a good relationship \ud83e\udd74", "My mantra is while the post itself is likely fake, there is someone out there dealing with the exact same situation.

That\u2019s your genuine insight.", "You are a horrible human being.  I hope you lose all your friends over this childish behavior.", "\u201cGoing further\u201d means she told OP that she wasn\u2019t being a friend and Op treated that as if this poor woman had shot her or something. That is not going farther, that\u2019s just stating a fact. Maybe the friend\u2019s boyfriend didn\u2019t want her to hang out with Op because Op is a toxic ahole. Agreed that OP sounds like an actual nightmare to deal with.", "THIS^  and did you catch the part where she said that she accepted her fianc\u00e9 into \u201ctheir\u201d life? Lol. She really does think that she\u2019s a conjoined twin", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. That\u2019s so horrible\u2026 I couldn\u2019t imagine what growing up with someone who could do that would be like.

You will be a nightmare for the bride.", "Girl, just stop. It\u2019s not your wedding. You are ruining whatever friendship you actually have with this mean girl shit.

Plus, how do you know what this person has gone through? Were you getting daily updates on her illness and treatment? \n\nYou are narcissistic, manipulative, and a horrible human being.

That's 1000% the bride's choice to make & doesn't need your input or opinions. You can be bummed that you weren't given the spotlight *you* wanted & think you deserve, but you can't say & do what you did. Also, your edit & comments make you look even worse. You have zero empathy & aren't being a good friend or person. YTA & need to take a step back & get some empathy. Stop trying to make it about you like you're claiming the cousin will due to the effects of surviving literal cancer. You should be ashamed of yourself for how you're behaving & the things you've said.", "... She's literally a member of the bride's family? And as a cancer survivor, YTA for the comments about her body and her hair, as if those things matter, and for referring to chemo as \"some medical treatment\" as if we didn't have literal poison pumped into our bodies over and over and over again hoping that it would help. \n\nWow.", "\u201cInsane amount of pity.\u201d \n\nDamn. My best friend had a very treatable form of leukemia, \u201conly\u201d had to do five rounds of chemo, and it has been absolutely soul crushing.

She wasn\u2019t that sick! Girl, everything you say is just you digging a deeper hole. Absolutely YTA.", "YES!!!  \nI'm too lazy to come back to the original post and look for this caption, but it was that, what struck me the most. \"THEIR LIFE\" ??? She graciously \" accepted \" him? How dumb can one be?", "I was honestly going to mention the fiance thing. Like, it seems like he saw right through her selfish \"me me me\" attitude and *rightfully* wanted to keep the bride away from the OP. Total Yikes.
