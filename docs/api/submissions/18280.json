They're doing an awesome job baking cakes, cupcakes, pies, bread, cookies,... and spending a lot of time/taking great pride in decorating them. \n\nNow, our family has caught wind of her passion and we have all been stimulating her dream to become a worldclass pattisier. She has been recieving \"orders\" and even when she doesn't she'll try and bake something for whoever we're seeing that day. \n\nFast forward to today. We have an elderly couple in the family and she decided she was going to try cookies. As the husband of the couple is a diabetic she decided to try her hand at a sugarfree recipe so he could eat some as well. \n\nShe spends a lot of time researching recipes, baking and decorating said cookies and when the elderly couple arrives she proudly shows off her plate and says \"look, these are sugarfree so you can have some too!\"\n\nThe man looks at her like she asked him to eat fried dogshit and tells her, quite angrily but without raising his voice that she doesn't get to police what he eats and that if she wants to be a baker she'll need to \"actually get good\". \n\nI watched all enjoyment and pride drain from her face and her eyes teared up. Already fuming i'm walking up to my child when the man rolls his eyes, calls her \"a little baby\" and tells her that she'll also have to learn how to take critisism. \n\n*Now, from a parenting pov I know I fucked up, this is no example to set.* \n\nI absolutely lost my shit. I yelled (full on yelled) that he was to leave my house and that he wouldn't be getting the cookies even if he promised to choke on them. When he refused to leave I grabbed his arm and removed him from my house, while using some colorful language and promising he wouldn't be allowed near any part of my family ever again. They ended up leaving, leaving my child gutted and wondering what she did wrong. \n\nI've spent the last hour consoling her and making sure she realises she did absolutely nothing wrong and that she doesn't lose her passion for baking over this. Now messages and phonecalls are coming in, telling me I overreacted, to the extent that I am starting to wonder if I actually did. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Frankly, I love that you actually forced him out of the house. A bit over board, but I'm okay with that.  Personally I don't care if its the driest damn cookie on the planet, if a child made it, I'm gonna choke it down.", "He's 65 ans of sane mind. Works as an accountant and has a variety of hobbies.
