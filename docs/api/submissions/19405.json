She has been in their lives since they were 5 and 3 and married their dad when they were 6 and 4. Agreeing to be adopted by the only mother either of them remembers doesn't besmirch the memory of the mother who gave birth to them. It wasn't a rejection of the maternal family.

You're being willfully ignorant. They left the money the way they did to create conflict and punish.", "Barring some serious issue no set out in the post, it was absolutely the right thing to do to adopt the two younger children, even if OP did not want to be adopted.  At that point step mom had been a defacto custodial parent for 3 years to the two young children.  It was important for her to get parental rights in case something happened to the dad, or in case an emergency came up regarding one of the kids and dad was unavailable for some reason.  Plus the other two kids wanted it.  OP was old enough at that point to make his own decision, but him not wanting to be adopted shouldn't prevent dad and step mom from doing the right thing for the other two.  Also, it seems like Grandma was creating, or at least contributing to the schism that did develop. OP says \"unfortunately\" the brothers wanted to be adopted and also that his grandparents were against it.  Why the hell would the grandparents be against it or OP consider it unfortunate other than they felt it was somehow disrespectfule to the deceased mother? It wasn't disrespectful, it was what was in the best interest of the two children.  Grandma, of course, is entitled to bequeath to whomever she wants and she has a reasonable rationale for only doing so to the eldest child (the siblings have a potential other inheritance source in their new adopted family), but the subtext here reads that grandparents were angry that dad moved on too quick and are taking it out on the younger boys and rewarding OP for seeing things their way.", "The grandparents left OP money as an inheritance. That's it. That's all. \n\nYou're the one assuming the actions of the dead was to punish and create division. All they did was choose to leave their legal grandchild - their deceased daughter's legal child - an inheritance. The brothers chose to be adopted and be their stepmother's legal children. Legally speaking, the brothers are not even grandchildren anymore. The brothers are just strangers and OP's half-siblings in the eyes of the law. They are not legally related to the grandparents.\n\nOP's father and brother CHOSE to create division by believing they're entitled to money that was left solely to OP. That's on them. They could have chosen to not allow this to divide them. Father could have put the kibosh on the adoption and brothers could have decided to remain unadopted. None of those things happened. Instead, brother and dad showed OP their true colors in regards to OP's legally inherited money. That's on them. \n\nLike I said, actions have consequences, regardless of age. Right or wrong, these are the fruits born of the choices made by the father and the brothers. OP was left an inheritance, brothers weren't. Brothers and dad could choose not to allow this to tear the family apart, they chose to allow it do so. OP chooses not to share and is under no obligation to share money that is legally theirs.", "That could be the case. We don't know what happened in this family. I also agree about the brothers being adopted, but it doesn't change the fact that actions have consequences nor does it change the fact that OP is the heir of this inheritance and father and brothers are not entitled to any of it.", "There\u2019s a lot of context missing about OP\u2019s parents and their relationship prior to the death of his mom, and the relationship of OP\u2019s dad to his grandparents (before they passed). For all we know, the grandparents may have had good reason to dislike his dad or stepmom for some reason, and the adoption came five years after marriage. That distinction of formally recognizing stepmom as a parent was ultimately what divided the kids, legally and even further emotionally.", "> You're the one assuming \n\nAnd you're assuming they didn't do it to be malicious. \n\nAtleast my assumption makes sense because any rational person would know this was going to create conflict.", "I agree that OP should keep the money and I think brothers and dad are being assholes.  Honestly I think everyone sucks here but step mom who, from the info provided, just wanted to do what was in the best interests of the three kids.", "My assumption is that if there were some issue with the step mom OP would have included it in the post.  He says nothing about her other than she wanted to adopt all three kids.  It sounds to me like OP had the normal reaction some kids have when one parent dies that it would be some sort of betrayal to get a new parent to replace the deceased one, but that his brothers didn't feel the same way (possibly do to their young age at the time of her passing but who knows).  There is nothing to indicate she was an unfit parent here. It also sounds like Grandma and Grandpa either just didn't like step mom, or they were mad because dad \"moved on too fast\" or something similar.", "OMG for the last time...\n\nThe grandparents aren't the ones who chose for this to become a conflict. The father and brothers are the ones who chose for this to become a conflict because they refuse to accept the consequences for their actions.\n\nWe can go in circles like this all day. It doesn't matter. OP was left money. Father and brothers weren't. We won't know if the grandparents intent was malicious, they're dead.\n\nNo I'm not assuming anything about they grandparents' actions. Why would I? They're dead. I'm stating facts. They left OP as the sole legal heir in lieu of their deceased daughter as OP is their daughter's only legal child. That's it.", "Yeah. I'm trying to look at this from as neutral of a spot as possible. If this were my kids, I would be happy for my child and tell my younger kids to back off.

OP was the only one who resisted it seems.", "For children of that age, the responsibility lies with the surviving parent, so OP's father is the biggest AH here.", "She\u2019s the only maternal figure they knew tho. They were 3 and 1 when their mother died", "Yeah I know\u2026 that\u2019s why I said I agree\u2026 first 5 words of my post\u2026", "That was to go away for long periods of time tho. Not just weekend visits and stuff.", "OP specifically mentioned it was for when they went away for longer times & to me that reads they wanted the whole family to go together on vacation. And OP still visiting at other times like on the weekend.", "What would constitute meeting halfway here?", "Ah ok I see what you mean. Maybe they removed the mum's surname and hyphenated SM's instead? Bit unusual like you say though, yeah.", "Doesn't mean adoption was warranted.\n\nAdoption as a means of erasing the biological parent is never warranted.", "> But it doesn\u2019t sound like they had a nonexistent relationship with them\n\nKinda does...\n\nFrom OP\n\n\"I asked them when was the last time they visited our mom's grave, or even their grandparents, but they had no answer.\"", "In this case the adoption was to legally cement an important real bond. Without adoption, OPs siblings risked losing their only mother figure in the event of their dad's death or a divorce. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of adoption, but to say it was solely as a means of erasing the biological parent and was unwarranted is ridiculous.", "The advantage is that if there's a divorce or their dad dies the kids other primary carer has a legal right to remain in their lives.\n\nIt's not a trivial name change.", "Not everyone visits their deceased relations gravestones. There are lots of people who don\u2019t go to graveyards beyond the burial. \n\nAnd again, not a close relationship but not nonexistent.", "Well, the father seems to have done nothing to maintain the relationship with their maternal family, so to me this is a hint that adoption could have had that objective. Also, IMO, he should have made an effort to remember his first wife and mother of the oldest sibling, specially when is clear that OP never forgot his mother.\n\nOverall, I thing OP's father is the AH here because he allowed the division of the sibling and it doesn't seem like he is worried about the root of the problem among his sons, which, again, is mostly OP's father responsibility."]}
