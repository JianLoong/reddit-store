She has been in their lives since they were 5 and 3 and married their dad when they were 6 and 4. Agreeing to be adopted by the only mother either of them remembers doesn't besmirch the memory of the mother who gave birth to them. It wasn't a rejection of the maternal family.

You're being willfully ignorant. They left the money the way they did to create conflict and punish.", "Barring some serious issue no set out in the post, it was absolutely the right thing to do to adopt the two younger children, even if OP did not want to be adopted.  At that point step mom had been a defacto custodial parent for 3 years to the two young children.  It was important for her to get parental rights in case something happened to the dad, or in case an emergency came up regarding one of the kids and dad was unavailable for some reason.  Plus the other two kids wanted it.  OP was old enough at that point to make his own decision, but him not wanting to be adopted shouldn't prevent dad and step mom from doing the right thing for the other two.  Also, it seems like Grandma was creating, or at least contributing to the schism that did develop. OP says \"unfortunately\" the brothers wanted to be adopted and also that his grandparents were against it.  Why the hell would the grandparents be against it or OP consider it unfortunate other than they felt it was somehow disrespectfule to the deceased mother? It wasn't disrespectful, it was what was in the best interest of the two children.  Grandma, of course, is entitled to bequeath to whomever she wants and she has a reasonable rationale for only doing so to the eldest child (the siblings have a potential other inheritance source in their new adopted family), but the subtext here reads that grandparents were angry that dad moved on too quick and are taking it out on the younger boys and rewarding OP for seeing things their way.", "The grandparents left OP money as an inheritance. That's it. That's all. \n\nYou're the one assuming the actions of the dead was to punish and create division. All they did was choose to leave their legal grandchild - their deceased daughter's legal child - an inheritance. The brothers chose to be adopted and be their stepmother's legal children. Legally speaking, the brothers are not even grandchildren anymore. The brothers are just strangers and OP's half-siblings in the eyes of the law. They are not legally related to the grandparents.\n\nOP's father and brother CHOSE to create division by believing they're entitled to money that was left solely to OP. That's on them. They could have chosen to not allow this to divide them. Father could have put the kibosh on the adoption and brothers could have decided to remain unadopted. None of those things happened. Instead, brother and dad showed OP their true colors in regards to OP's legally inherited money. That's on them. \n\nLike I said, actions have consequences, regardless of age. Right or wrong, these are the fruits born of the choices made by the father and the brothers. OP was left an inheritance, brothers weren't. Brothers and dad could choose not to allow this to tear the family apart, they chose to allow it do so. OP chooses not to share and is under no obligation to share money that is legally theirs.", "That could be the case. We don't know what happened in this family. I also agree about the brothers being adopted, but it doesn't change the fact that actions have consequences nor does it change the fact that OP is the heir of this inheritance and father and brothers are not entitled to any of it.", "There\u2019s a lot of context missing about OP\u2019s parents and their relationship prior to the death of his mom, and the relationship of OP\u2019s dad to his grandparents (before they passed). For all we know, the grandparents may have had good reason to dislike his dad or stepmom for some reason, and the adoption came five years after marriage. That distinction of formally recognizing stepmom as a parent was ultimately what divided the kids, legally and even further emotionally.", "> You're the one assuming \n\nAnd you're assuming they didn't do it to be malicious. \n\nAtleast my assumption makes sense because any rational person would know this was going to create conflict.", "I agree that OP should keep the money and I think brothers and dad are being assholes.  Honestly I think everyone sucks here but step mom who, from the info provided, just wanted to do what was in the best interests of the three kids.", "My assumption is that if there were some issue with the step mom OP would have included it in the post.  He says nothing about her other than she wanted to adopt all three kids.  It sounds to me like OP had the normal reaction some kids have when one parent dies that it would be some sort of betrayal to get a new parent to replace the deceased one, but that his brothers didn't feel the same way (possibly do to their young age at the time of her passing but who knows).  There is nothing to indicate she was an unfit parent here. It also sounds like Grandma and Grandpa either just didn't like step mom, or they were mad because dad \"moved on too fast\" or something similar.", "OMG for the last time...\n\nThe grandparents aren't the ones who chose for this to become a conflict. The father and brothers are the ones who chose for this to become a conflict because they refuse to accept the consequences for their actions.\n\nWe can go in circles like this all day. It doesn't matter. OP was left money. Father and brothers weren't. We won't know if the grandparents intent was malicious, they're dead.\n\nNo I'm not assuming anything about they grandparents' actions. Why would I? They're dead. I'm stating facts. They left OP as the sole legal heir in lieu of their deceased daughter as OP is their daughter's only legal child. That's it.", "Yeah. I'm trying to look at this from as neutral of a spot as possible. If this were my kids, I would be happy for my child and tell my younger kids to back off.

They\u2019re envious is all it is and it\u2019s a bad look on them.\n\nHonestly I\u2019d cut contact. They don\u2019t sound like family to me.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Don\u2019t give them a dime.", "Nta. If your younger sibs are adopted by stepmom, then this should mean they can have an inheritance from her side of the family. So how bout tell stepmoms family to add them to their will to give them their inheritance when they die then? Bec legally speaking, theyre a part of stepmoms family so stepmoms parents are their grandparents now\u2026if thats how it works. \n\nBec i doubt stepmoms parents will leave you anything anyway when they die since youre not legally part of their family. (Question is are stepmoms parents still alive though and do they have an existing relationship with your bros?)", "INFO - Were they \u201cdevastated\u201d at any point prior to finding out they lost out on free money?", "NTA. Stay with uncle. Money makes people crazy. They aren't looking out for you, only themselves.", "If your uncle is willing to let you live with him until you are ready to be on your own, that's your best bet. Do not give any of them a dime.\n\nEDIT: Just re-read your age. Take the money and get a place of your own. Don't go back to your dad's, you are an adult. You should not be with your uncle either. Move out, get a therapist and/or some distance and work out who you want in your life. Good luck.", "I'm glad OP has someone in his life calling it out correctly.", "Yup. NTA", "Absolutely this.  The adoption matters less than how your brothers treated your maternal family. You shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to divide the money equally with them.  But it would be a nice gesture, depending on the amount you received, to set aside a set amount for college funds.", "It seems dad made himself pretty clear: don't come back unless you're willing to apologize. What is she to apologize for? I'm sorry I have a closer relationship with my grandma? Dad is not a dad", "Sounds like uncle is more of a dad to OP than her biological father. If OP preferred to spend more time with her mother's side of the fam than with her dad, stepmom, and bros, that actually tells you a lot about their relationship, which is NOT good.", "I feel like the grandparents probably deserve more of the blame for letting that connection die than the ones that were literal toddlers when the mom died.", "Isn't a will is a legal document? Idk what grounds dad has for taking OP to court.", "It's not even necessarily the adoption that's the issue, it's the lack of relationship with that side of the family. Yes they were younger, but they grew up too.", "It should all be on dad. Grandparents can't foster a relationship if the dad isn't willing to meet them halfway", "Yes, it was a difficult situation for OP. She did what she thought was best for her even though it might have alienated her from the rest of her immediate family. However, her dad and brothers are demanding her inheritance from her grandmother with whom the brothers barely had much of a relationship with is the issue. Grandma gave the money to her. There should be no ifs ands or buts about this situation. I don't understand why dad feels the boys are somehow entitled to this money from this woman just because they share the same blood.", "OOP is a male.", "Oh my bad.", "Woah. Look at you just making up shit \ud83e\udd23 where did it say the grandparents were hostile ?", "Being their grandchildren doesn\u2019t mean they are entitled to their inheritance. They have the rights to will it how they want to.", "NTA, your uncle is correct. It's so harsh and wrong of your dad to kick you out of the house for this", "NTA. Stay with your uncle.", "STAND YOUR GROUND!! Your grandparents knew exactly what they were doing. You do not share a dime with anybody. \n\nNTA.", "NTAH- your dad and brothers ARE using emotional manipulation to try to change your mind. Your grandparents decided whom they wanted to inherit their estate- that\u2019s who should inherit it. No one else.", "NTA.\nThey weren't upset when the grandparents passed away. So why on earth would they be entitled to any of their money. Your uncle is 100% correct it's emotional blackmail.", "NTA... they were younger and shouldn't be blamed for accepting a new parent. \nHowever your grandparents made a will and put their wishes in it. In the end you are following their wish. \nAlso the emotional blackmailing is wrong.", "NTA. \n\nListen to your uncle. He\u2019s right, this is emotional blackmail - and honestly, a bit of financial abuse. Kicking you out of the house, with no notice (and I\u2019m assuming none of your belongings) because you wouldn\u2019t share money that was legally yours? Not okay. \n\nYour brothers aren\u2019t entitled to anything. Your father cannot maintain this \u2018everything is shared\u2019 charade when his children are adults, and I promise it will collapse on him soon enough. In the meantime, get out. Stay with your uncle, if you can, or use your inheritance to buy/rent a small flat. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend you send notice (by registered mail) to your fathers home that you are collecting your things on x date. Take some friends (the bigger the better) so you don\u2019t face the tirade of abuse alone, and call the police if your dad/brothers try to stop you from getting your stuff. Be aware that when your father realised that ordering you around won\u2019t work, he\u2019ll likely resort to begging and crying (your brothers are your mothers children too, you can\u2019t do this to them, etc etc). Stand your ground and document everything. You do have rights here, and I suggest you assert them.", "NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to go back, they made their choice, you made yours and grandma made hers. Take that money and go out on your own. Go no contact for awhile or forever if that\u2019s best for you so sorry for your loss", "NTA. You are absolutely in the right, and I'm glad you have your uncle to fall back on. Because in your time of need it is important for someone to have your back and I'm glad it's someone you can trust.", "NTA", "NTA.  Stick with your aunt and uncle.", "Your uncle is a good man", "I swear this has already been posted, like weeks ago.", "YTA , I am sure your mother would want you to be all happy and you all sound very miserable over her memory.", "NTA. Yeah its a little unfair on them, they are related by blood but they didn't foster a good relationship with Grandparents and ultimately the will is the final say and to disrespect that, isn't ok.", "stay with uncle, block your brothers. nta.", "I feel like the grandparents should be in that soft asshole group. I have a feeling they interjected their negative feelings on their son-in-law moving on from their daughter\u2019s death into OP\u2019s relationship with his family.", "I agree with you. The grandparents are definitely the AHs who were so angry that little kids accepted stepmom that they became spiteful. The inheritance was meant to divide and hurt. OP doesn\u2019t realize it, but she is a pawn in the grandparents\u2019 revenge scheme.", "You don't have to adopt what is the advantage of adopting other than the name?  She wanted to make the kids feel like hers with their name. \n\nOp keep it all don't let them get anything.  I love my gma and it's the only one I have ever known she's 97 and can't remember 2 mins before but we keep her home.  We will not put her in a nursing home unless we can't care for her.  Your gma loved you and saw your love and loyalty to your mom. That's why you got the money.  I wish you all the best in your future."]}
