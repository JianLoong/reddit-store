I live alone, so I just make my own food for myself, but because of Ella\u2019s allergy, I don\u2019t make foods with peanuts in them when I know I\u2019m also cooking for her.\n\nHer allergy is only reactive if she ingests a good amount of the actual nut and is unaffected by smell, airborne, and small traces of cross contamination. Recently, I made a dish which contains a heavy usage of nuts blended into the curry so you can\u2019t see that they\u2019re there and left the leftovers in my fridge. Ella came over while I was in the shower, and during that time she apparently went into my fridge and helped herself to a big portion of the curry and immediately started having an allergic reaction. Luckily she had her epipen and was okay after a few minutes, but she absolutely went off on me and kept accusing me of causing her harm.\n\nI felt extremely guilty that she had a bad allergic reaction from my food and apologized profusely and offered to take her to the hospital, but she was just screaming at me the whole time. She said that if I really cared about her I should have labeled all of my food for her and let her know ahead of time exactly what in the fridge has nuts. I understand that this is extremely scary and important for her health, but the same time she 1) never asked me to label things before 2) went into my fridge and helped herself to my food without even asking me 3) got mad at me for cooking my cultural dishes at all because they have her allergen in them.\n\nI told her that going forward, I\u2019ll try to put a sticky note on the containers that have nuts in the food so this doesn\u2019t happen again, but that she also cannot blame me for her allergic reaction when she ate my food without even asking me if she could or what was in it.

You don't need to label your food or change your cooking process, she just needs to ask you if something has nuts in it before eating it.\n\n\nAlso, it is kind of a red flag that she was assuming all your food in your home would be peanut free when you have only been dating 2 months.", "You're girlfriend of two months came over to your house and helped herself to leftovers in your refrigerator while you were in the shower, without asking, knowing you cook with nuts and nut products? Oh hell, NTA. Her allergic reaction was caused by her lack of manners and common sense.", "NTA. It was an accident. \n\nIt's also your apartment, your fridge, your food. She should accept that your own personal space is your personal space. That means you can strip naked, lather yourself up with chocolate fudge, roll around in peanuts, and call yourself an sundae if it pleases you. The larger issue is she doesn't live there and it's unrealistic to expect you to always think of her in your own home. It's her personal responsibility to manage her own allergy.", "NTA. First of all, her taking your food without asking was rude. Second, as someone who has an allergy, she should know better than to just stuff her face with food  when she doesn't know what's in it. That's beyond stupid, especially if she knows there's a fair chance that nuts were used in the preparation of the dish. You shouldn't have to label your food so she can help herself to whatever is in your fridge whenever she wants. Just tell her to assume that whatever is in there has nuts unless you've explicitly told her otherwise.", "Your title makes you sound like a total AH, but the actual situation is definitely NTA.\n\nYour gf is already aware that when you don't cook specifically for her, your food probably has nuts in it. Why would she then assume that a random dish she found is nut-free? On top of that, you've only been going out two months, but she is just helping herself to random food in your fridge without checking first? Not cool.\n\nSorry, but she needs to take her allergy more seriously. I have a peanut allergy too, and if I was in her position I would 100% ask about nut content before touching anything in your house.", "NTA\n\nAs you say, she didn't ask about the food, and if she knows you eat stuff with peanuts, she should have erred on the side of caution.", "NTA. If she comes in and *helps herself to the food in your fridge* without even asking you first, I'd say she was TAH. What if that was your dinner?  \n\nYou two are relatively new; it seems weird to be in the \"I'll just help myself to whatever you have in the fridge\" stage already.  Be clear that you don't use nuts ***if*** *you're cooking for her* *specifically*, but she should assume anything else in your kitchen would be made in the style that you're used to eating, ie delicious.", "NTA.

If she has an allergy, shouldn\u2019t she have asked you? \n\n\nAlso, does she know you cook food with nuts in it?", "NTA - You live alone and she knows or should know that nuts are a part of your cultural dishes. As someone with an allergy she should have asked if it was safe before taking it and eating it without asking. \n\nLabelling food that contains nuts is a good way to play it safe. But that is a discussion that should have been had before she started helping herself to your food. It also doesn\u2019t change the fact that she doesn\u2019t live there and didn\u2019t pay for the food.

You then proceed to agree to start labeling your food for her and you\u2019re still at fault??? This girl needs to be responsible for herself. People who have severe allergies always ask first! Sorry I shy away from blanket statements trashing people but she sounds a little high maintenance!", "NTA. It is her allergy and her responsibility to manage.  She should have known to ask you before she ate food that she did not know the ingredients of.

If you live alone and normally only cook for yourself, she should be smart enough to assume your food has nuts in them. Or wait to ask you if it does. She's an adult and should be mature enough to properly handle her allergies if they're that dangerous to her. She had no right to go off on you. That's HER fault for eating something she wasn't sure of.", "NTA.

She could've asked before eating your food, since it was your place. However, if you already live together, maybe then try to compromise on something to avoid this happening again.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s rude to eat people\u2019s food without asking, also if you have allergies they\u2019re your responsibility.", "She is an adult and has a known food allergy. She\u2019s 100% responsible here for eating something when she didn\u2019t know what was in it.", "NTA. You two aren\u2019t living together so she shouldn\u2019t be demanding you label your personal food in your fridge on the chance she lets herself into your house while you are busy doing something else. Since she has an allergy, one would hope she\u2019d be more cautious about eating random dishes especially when her bf makes cultural dishes with nuts.", "NTA \n\nAnybody with a severe allergy should know to ask before consuming unknown food. That is not your responsibility. It could be a kind thing for you to label unsafe foods \u2014 if she had ever asked before, but this is all on her.", "Her allergy is not her fault but it is her responsibility. She should have asked", "Be glad she showed her true colors after only 2 months. This is not someone you can have a healthy relationship with.", "NTA. I understand being upset and scared by a serious allergic reaction like that but you didn\u2019t do anything malicious. You had no way of knowing she planned to eat food from your fridge without warning you. Knowing many of your foods are made with nuts, it\u2019s on her to check before eating food like that.", "You\u2019d think somebody with a life-threatening allergy would be smart enough to not dive into a random bit of food without being sure it\u2019s safe. She screwed up and is blaming you. Absolutely NTA!", "NTA. She knows you cook with nuts and helped herself to unlabeled food. That's honestly pretty dumb of her.", "NTA- your girlfriend needs to not eat anything without reading the ingredient label. \nShoudl your relationship move to the next level, maybe eat the nutty food at your parents house when she\u2019s not with you.", "NTA. But think about if you want to be constantly blamed for things you didn't do. I have a food intolerance and do have to ask when out at restaurants/potluck, but I wouldn't ever go into another person's fridge unannounced and eat their food, period. That's just rude.", "Nta. She should have asked before eating it. But now that you know.. well just tell her all foods in your fridge has nuts in it unless you say it doesnt.", " NTA. She had no business stealing your food. You shouldn\u2019t have to label your own food in your own home. Giving in to her demand now will set the stage for you being the bad guy every time. Set boundaries.", "NTA. It was a meal for yourself, not both of you.  She is responsible for her own health and should know never to assume what might be in her food.  You've been dating two months, it might be time to move on.", "Can you get some stickers , put on container and write nuts on stickers? That would alleviate further problems, though i believe it was GF at fault. If she knows you cook with peanuts she shouldn\u2019t be tasting food without asking.", "NAH i guess. She probably had a scare, understandibly, and was upset. But you seem to be trying to compromise going forward. Seems like you'll work it out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If there is no one to ask (or someone isn't sure), I do not even attempt to eat it. It is my responsibility to make sure that I don't eat anything that will not agree with me.  \n\n**NTA**, OP.  She took it upon herself to eat something from your fridge without asking you if there were nuts in it. That is her fault, and her fault alone.", "Yup!!! She knows you cook with peanut/nut products when you\u2019re not cooking for her, that was her warning!", "This. \ud83d\udcaf", "God. Now I kind of want to do that.", "I always have to check myself with fridge reactions and then remind myself that my relationship started off atypically so I didn\u2019t encounter those boundaries.", "Ooh, interesting. So you're suggesting she might have lied about the severity or even using the epi pen?", "I personally don\u2019t have any allergies so I\u2019m not sure how they work. I wasn\u2019t present for her allergic reaction so this is all of what she told me once I got out of the shower", "Yeah, right? Too bad if that was his lunch for the next day, I guess.  \n\n\nNTA. You're totally in the right. She went into your fridge without permission and took your food. Had she asked, *like she should have*, the situation would never have happened.", "Why should he do that for? That\u2019s also just a waste of stickers.", "The GF is a huge AH here.", "The GF putting all the blame on OP is pretty AH behaviour", "Just wondering... isn't someone supposed to go to the hospital when they have a reaction enough to use an Epipen?  If that's true, I suspect that either OP made up the story or the GF is lying.", "This so much. I have allergies and food intolerance and I never ever eat something without checking. Never.", "Or she isn\u2019t managing her allergy properly and got lucky. We had to use epinephrine on my kid once and all they did at the hospital was observe him. But, you can have a delayed reaction after the epinephrine wears off and end up needing actual medical care. My kid didn\u2019t need anything, but some people do.", "well like i mentioned i have a very severe peanut allergy and have several epi pens in my possession. they explicitly tell you when prescribing you an epi pen that it does *not* stop the reaction and you *must* go to the hospital after injecting yourself", "Yeah, I really think she lied to you. A person is *always* supposed to call emergency services or go to the hospital after using an epinephrine injection. Someone who has just suffered a serious allergic reaction and has received a dose of epi will absolutely *not* be fine a few minutes later. Both will leave you feeling like complete ass.", "I use stickers to date my leftovers so no different. It\u2019s also called compromise something couples try do in relationships.", "She had a death scare. Nothing she said in the heat of the moment is relevant.\n\nWhat matters is what happens next.", "It is recommended, but it sounds like OP is the US, where we treat everything as \u201cmerely a flesh wound\u201d to avoid hospitalization costs.", "You\u2019re supposed to, but not everyone does. When my daughter had an anaphylactic reaction in day care, the paramedics advised that she did not need transport to the hospital because she had her epi-pen. The allergist was FURIOUS when I told her.", "> I suspect that either OP made up the story\n\nI'm fairly certain that the vast majority of posts on this on this subreddit are either made up or reposts or are highly distorted compared to what actually happened.", "I worked in airline industry a few years ago. You world be surprised how many people are chevalier about nut allergies and don\u2019t carry epi-pen. Very important when on an aircraft and FA is serving all passengers nuts. They would forget to tell us! If you\u2019ve ever had food service stopped or all nuts recollected that is usually why.", "Unless they\u2019re in America and uninsured", ">Just wondering... isn't someone supposed to go to the hospital when they have a reaction enough to use an Epipen?\n\nNot always. \n\nIn the UK, a lot of doctors & paramedics do advise adults with severe allergies who use an epipen more than twice a day that they only need to go to the hospital if they have either: missed a daily dose, are in moderate-severe pain or have used their epipen at least 3 times since the allergy trigger but continue to experience symptoms for more than 20mins post allergic reaction.", "Yep. You absolutely have to go. \n\nI agree with you, someone's lying!", "Or GF has bad or no insurance\u2026 epi-pens and ER visits are so expensive, even with insurance.", "I live in the midwestern US and have been trained in pediatric first aid/CPR. It's taught that use of an epi-pen is always a 911 emergency call because epinehprine is considered a temporary thing and if it wears off the allergic reaction could potentially restart and cause further harm.\nThat being said, the US healthcare system is fundamentally broken and it's entirely possible that a person didn't want to call EMS because of the cost factor. This is also Reddit and it's entirely possible that any of these stories are completely fabricated. While I love seeing people get called out on their BS, take what you read on the internet with a grain of salt.", "See, I don\u2019t have one myself but my coworker does and she\u2019s used it twice. Each time she needed a ride to the ER. But I didn\u2019t want to contradict OP since I do not have direct experience.", "I have a severe nut allergy and have several epi pens on in my purse and on in the house at all times and it depends on how bad her allergic reaction was to that specific nut. AND the big reason to go in is not for antihistamines you can use your epi and then crush a histamine blocker for a low level reaction but it's because you have just injected epinephrine jump starting your system putting g it under enormous pressure.", "What happened next is that she stayed angry at OP ..hense the post", "Yeah, epi pens are generally \"delay reaction to give you time to get to the hospital\" rather than a cure.  You aren't required to go but it's strongly recommended.", "yeah, all i'm saying is if she truly injected herself she'd want to go to hospital", "I know I do. I have this enormous \"high\" (think speed not weed)  moment after use it can make you illogically angry according to some warnings iv been told. But the crash that sucks and its quick."]}
