My family is from an Asian background so a majority of the food I cook for just myself include peanuts and other nuts because it\u2019s an important ingredient in my cultural dishes. I live alone, so I just make my own food for myself, but because of Ella\u2019s allergy, I don\u2019t make foods with peanuts in them when I know I\u2019m also cooking for her.\n\nHer allergy is only reactive if she ingests a good amount of the actual nut and is unaffected by smell, airborne, and small traces of cross contamination. Recently, I made a dish which contains a heavy usage of nuts blended into the curry so you can\u2019t see that they\u2019re there and left the leftovers in my fridge. Ella came over while I was in the shower, and during that time she apparently went into my fridge and helped herself to a big portion of the curry and immediately started having an allergic reaction. Luckily she had her epipen and was okay after a few minutes, but she absolutely went off on me and kept accusing me of causing her harm.\n\nI felt extremely guilty that she had a bad allergic reaction from my food and apologized profusely and offered to take her to the hospital, but she was just screaming at me the whole time. She said that if I really cared about her I should have labeled all of my food for her and let her know ahead of time exactly what in the fridge has nuts. I understand that this is extremely scary and important for her health, but the same time she 1) never asked me to label things before 2) went into my fridge and helped herself to my food without even asking me 3) got mad at me for cooking my cultural dishes at all because they have her allergen in them.\n\nI told her that going forward, I\u2019ll try to put a sticky note on the containers that have nuts in the food so this doesn\u2019t happen again, but that she also cannot blame me for her allergic reaction when she ate my food without even asking me if she could or what was in it.

It was an accident. \n\nIt's also your apartment, your fridge, your food. She should accept that your own personal space is your personal space. That means you can strip naked, lather yourself up with chocolate fudge, roll around in peanuts, and call yourself an sundae if it pleases you. The larger issue is she doesn't live there and it's unrealistic to expect you to always think of her in your own home. It's her personal responsibility to manage her own allergy.", "NTA. First of all, her taking your food without asking was rude. Second, as someone who has an allergy, she should know better than to just stuff her face with food  when she doesn't know what's in it. That's beyond stupid, especially if she knows there's a fair chance that nuts were used in the preparation of the dish. You shouldn't have to label your food so she can help herself to whatever is in your fridge whenever she wants.

Why would she then assume that a random dish she found is nut-free? On top of that, you've only been going out two months, but she is just helping herself to random food in your fridge without checking first? Not cool.\n\nSorry, but she needs to take her allergy more seriously. I have a peanut allergy too, and if I was in her position I would 100% ask about nut content before touching anything in your house.", "NTA\n\nAs you say, she didn't ask about the food, and if she knows you eat stuff with peanuts, she should have erred on the side of caution.", "NTA.

As someone with an allergy she should have asked if it was safe before taking it and eating it without asking. \n\nLabelling food that contains nuts is a good way to play it safe. But that is a discussion that should have been had before she started helping herself to your food. It also doesn\u2019t change the fact that she doesn\u2019t live there and didn\u2019t pay for the food.

Sorry I shy away from blanket statements trashing people but she sounds a little high maintenance!", "NTA. It is her allergy and her responsibility to manage.

If you live alone and normally only cook for yourself, she should be smart enough to assume your food has nuts in them. Or wait to ask you if it does.

She should have asked", "Be glad she showed her true colors after only 2 months. This is not someone you can have a healthy relationship with.", "NTA. I understand being upset and scared by a serious allergic reaction like that but you didn\u2019t do anything malicious. You had no way of knowing she planned to eat food from your fridge without warning you. Knowing many of your foods are made with nuts, it\u2019s on her to check before eating food like that.", "You\u2019d think somebody with a life-threatening allergy would be smart enough to not dive into a random bit of food without being sure it\u2019s safe.

She should have asked before eating it. But now that you know.. well just tell her all foods in your fridge has nuts in it unless you say it doesnt.", " NTA. She had no business stealing your food. You shouldn\u2019t have to label your own food in your own home. Giving in to her demand now will set the stage for you being the bad guy every time. Set boundaries.", "NTA. It was a meal for yourself, not both of you.  She is responsible for her own health and should know never to assume what might be in her food.  You've been dating two months, it might be time to move on.", "Can you get some stickers , put on container and write nuts on stickers? That would alleviate further problems, though i believe it was GF at fault. If she knows you cook with peanuts she shouldn\u2019t be tasting food without asking.", "NAH i guess.
