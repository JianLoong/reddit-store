You can still do a reduced rate for friends but that way you leave them with the choice whether to do it or not. I would not insist on charging this time unless you're willing to lose the friendship.", "I mean, he sounded extremely condescending when he said that. He could have just said \"she was having trouble with helping the kid with math so she asked me\" instead of commenting on her intelligence which served no purpose in this post, except to prove that he needed to be paid for being smarter than her.", "This is a good advice I was taught early in life but I failed to apply it and suffered the consequences.", "I totally agree, but if a friend would ask for my professional services it's accapteble to ask for a payment. Probably at a discount, but obviously tell them beforehand", "You don't have friends do you ?", "you must be miserable", "You have been taken advantage of. So sorry and I know how it feels. For any new encounters it better to clear it upfront that you are not a free available service.\n\nThe post is different because it's one time and money was not discussed beforehand.", "So you have no self control, gotcha", "YTA, its fine to charge even friends for services, but you have to make clear the intend on billing on it before. She asked for help, not for your service. Also saying she is noch book smart is showing that you are not a friend at all.", "YTA\n\nYou need to state up front if you are going to charge for something. I get it she shouldn't have assumed it would be free, because tutoring isn't a nanny duty, but ick for the \"not book smart\" comment and for a bait and switch.", "Yta", "YTA-I don\u2019t charge my friends anything for helping them. That\u2019s what friends do.

Wow are YTA.", "Let it go this time and ask her to let the kid\u2019s parents know you\u2019re available for tutoring if it\u2019s needed in the future.

The other night my friend was over for dinner and had pulled a muscle in her back so I gave her a quick 10 minute rub while we watched telly. Should I have charged her for it?\n\nIf you're going to charge you need to be upfront at the start. 'Yes friend, I can surely help you out with this. Just to check though, are you asking to book in a tutoring session with me or just a quick heads up? If you want a session that's no problem, my rate for that is X but I would be happy to accept X. If you're not looking for something so thorough I have 2 or 3 minutes here now I can give you'.\n\nI totally get that it's frustrating to be expected to give away your skillset for free to mates, but also you can't just spring a charge on her without clarifying first.

You cannot spring costs after the services are complete. You should have told her your rate before you tutored the kid she was baby sitting. She thought you were helping out as a friend.", "YTA 100%\n\nI had a partner once who paid his friend $100 to help him transport a few things literally 10 mins down the road that he couldn't fit in his car. He wasn't well-off, in fact the opposite. I said where I'm from we'd likely just order pizza & drinks, send a card, buy flowers etc. He did order pizza & beers, but also paid $100. I'd never charge a friend for helping them move a few things but he thought I was weird to say that \ud83e\udd14\n\nOP, I'm not surprised your friend felt the way she did.", "YTA for the fact that you did not let her know beforehand that you expected payment.", "YTA for not telling her you were going to charge. Then your friend can make a decision on whether she wants to get help from you. But you did the tutoring and then tried to charge her afterwards.", "You should have been upfront about your expectation of payment for services as most people when they help out a friend don\u2019t charge. Most people getting help from a friend wouldn\u2019t expect to be charged either so idk why you\u2019ve assumed that your friend knew to pay you, even at a discounted rate. \n\nYTA.", "YTA and not a good friend. Or at the very least a friend with a ridiculous attitude. Definitely.", "YTA they asked for help, unless they said 'hey can I employ you for 2 hours to help this kid' then they weren't asking for services for a professional, they were asking for help from a mate.\n\nBesides good business practice dictates you talk about payment or expectations of payment before rendering services. If you are unwilling to help put a friend for free then you should have made that clear the second she reached out to you. This is totally on you and you need to write it off, you did not confirm payment expecting before providing your help, that's your fault not your friends.", "YTA. If you\u2019re going to charge a friend reaching out for help, you need to make that clear ahead of time. \n\nIf I call up a friend for advice or help, I don\u2019t expect to pay anything and vice versa. Now, if this is a weekly thing, set a boundary and talk about how you need to look at it as business if it\u2019s going to be consistent. If this was a one time thing, then I question how much you consider this relationship a friendship.", "YTA", "For all people saying this person is TA i have one question... do you expect a friend thats a homerenovater to renovate/ fix things in your house for free? Or do you expect an artist friend to make you something for free if you ask them? Because to me that sounds the same, and i dont think its weird to charge for service. It would have been better to be open and ask about it upfront however, but i would never expect a professional to do something for free in any service whatsoever...\n\nI think NAH, only miscommunication of which blame is on both parties.", "YTA, you could turn down her request or tell her up front that you'd do it for a few, but to help out a friend and then ask to be paid is really awful.\n\nSo what if it's your job? She's your friend and you should at least make it clear that you'd do it as a professional and not a favor", "Always discuss payment first. You never had a payment agreement, you can't just decide to charge them after the fact. YTA", "YTA. A friend asked you for a favor and you charged her?!? If you were going to do that, you should have told her BEFORE you FaceTimed that you would assist only FOR A FEE and then agreed on a price. You can\u2019t wait until you assist her as a friend and then hit her up with an invoice. That\u2019s insane. I\u2019m a lawyer. I can\u2019t even imagine hitting my friends up for my hourly rate every time they ask me legal advice. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have any friends left if I did that. And my family?

That was so rude, YTA op. \n\nI would definitely need assistance if I were to have to help a middle schooler nowadays and I\u2019m 26.
