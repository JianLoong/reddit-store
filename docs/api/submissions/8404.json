I suggest agreeing an upfront rate for future work. \"Oh I thought you might do it for free\" \"Sorry, I don't work for free\".\n\nIf she's upset that her hourly rate is lower than yours, then she should take that up with her clients, other nannies, or the nanny union (if there is one) instead of complaining and trying to get out of paying you. She should seek to improve her own situation, not drag yours down to her level. It's not your fault that tutoring is in demand.
