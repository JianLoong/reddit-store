I talked to my wife and we agreed to let Jean stay, and set up our spare bedroom.\n\nThere's just one problem. Jean breastfeeds her baby and uses a breastmilk pump. The breastmilk pump is very, very loud and Jean frequently uses it in the middle of the night, even though her baby sleeps through the night.\n\nJean has woken up me, my wife and my kids several times in the night with the breastmilk pump and I think she's being a bit inconsiderate. My wife is really annoyed by it and thinks Jean has no self-awareness.\n\nI talked to Jean and explained that the pump is noisy and the walls in our home are very thin, I asked if she could use it during the day and not when everyone else is sleeping. Jean seemed shocked that I'd ask her that, and said that she's in a routine and that she read online that night time is the best time to pump.\n\nI told Jean that I understand but my family and I really need to sleep, and I offered to buy her a tub of baby formula for in case her milk supply runs low.\n\nThis really set her off, she said that breastmilk is liquid gold and that she couldn't believe I'd offer her formula, and said that me and my family need to stay out of her business and wear earplugs.\n\nI think Jean is overreacting and needs to compromise because she is living with other people. I told my wife about what happened and she thinks I should ask Jean to find somewhere else to live because if she won't compromise on this she won't compromise on other issues.

Formula is not the answer to this. Replacing pumps with formula is a quick way to lower your milk supply.  As a BF/pumping mom, I am very protective of my supply and any insinuation of making it dip with formula would result in me biting your head off. \n\nBuilding and maintaining a milk supply is the hardest thing I have ever done. It's a whole process of making sure you pump/nurse enough times and at the right time. \n\nPumping in the middle of the night is a necessity for some  in order to maintain their supply. Either they get too engorged, which is really painful and risks mastitis which can make you really sick, or their supply would dip if they skip it. \n\nThat being said, 8 months is a little long to still be doing this. By 8 months, I had weaned myself of my middle of the night pumps. Maybe she doesn't know that she is able to do that by now. Sometimes you get into your routine. She could possibly wean herself of this middle of the night pump if she is able to, but it will take time and effort on her part and will probably be painful for a little while. It's not as simple as stopping because you want to. It's a whole process.", "NTA not even a little bit. She can get a quiet pump.

COME ON! I would tell her she has to adjust the schedule with pumping or otherwise she has to find another solution to stay somewhere as no one is getting the rest they need around her. She is very inconsiderate. NTA\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t know about the consequences of not pumping regularly - so it might be not as easy as I originally thought to adjust the time.

And they are not complaining about it during the day, just the night. She could use the pump during the day and breastfeed directly at night, her supply would remain.\n\n Maybe switching times could be a better compromise, who knows.", "Exactly. She's on hard times, but he wants to move her from free food to expensive food? And then what, she moves out and can't afford formula now?", "Agree. Instead of offering formula, offer to buy her a newer pump. I guarantee if it's that loud, it's one of the crappy little pumps I used with my first. Can you discuss times at night it would be more appropriate to use? Like, instead of 2am, everyone could tolerate 4am better?", "Maybe a hand pump as others have suggested. They are quite cheap, and she could pay back when she can afford it. It is a NAH at the moment. I got mastitis when I didn't pump at night so it is important now she's in that routine.

So if they're planning to support her with formula for that long or longer (which, granted time frame isn't really mentioned in OP but I think it takes longer than that to get on your feet) then why not get a quieter pump instead. Pumping is hard work and pumping moms need support, not to be told to quit. Not to mention no pump is loud enough to wake the whole house. Not a single one.
