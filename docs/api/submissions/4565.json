Mia doesn\u2019t have kids nor wants kids but she\u2019s been brilliant with Ciara.\n\nI\u2019m a SAHM and obviously don\u2019t have as much time to hang out as I did previously. Mia and I live on the same street (we\u2019re in Manchester, England) and it\u2019s a walking distance between our houses. I\u2019ve told Mia numerous times that she can just pop in whenever she wants to (she works from home) but she rarely does. \n\nShe did at the beginning but it\u2019s been happening less and less. Instead, she keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or pizza or even a drink but I don\u2019t have the time and always just tell her to come over and we\u2019ll have coffee at my place.\n\nShe asked if I wanted to go out with her and her other friends for a drink last weekend but I said that no but she\u2019s welcome to come over and we\u2019ll have a few drinks at mine. She said she already had plans and it felt weird to drink when she knows there\u2019s a child around. \n\nHonestly, I feel neglected. I feel like she put me on a back burner and doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. I\u2019m always available but she rarely comes over and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\n\nToday, I saw her photos from Saturday night out and I was fuming. She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she\u2019s 20 again. I felt rejected and horrible, I thought we were best friends but she clearly doesn\u2019t value me when she won\u2019t even have a few drinks with me at my house.\n\nWhen she finished work, she called and asked if I fancied going for coffee to town but I asked her to come over again. She said yes but before she disconnected, I heard her mumble \u201clike always.\u201d This really annoyed me.\n\nWhen she came over, I decided to be open about everything. And while not my proudest or most mature moment, I shouted at her that she\u2019s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around.\n\nShe said she\u2019s always been accommodating but it\u2019s been 2 years and she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me when there\u2019s always a kid, especially now when she has to watch her language (Mia likes to swear).\n\nI said that she knew I had a child and responsibilities. And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off.\n\nThis felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage. \n\nI was really angry with her and kicked her out. She called me a selfish asshole on her way out.\n\nNormally, I would expect her to call by now with apologies but she hasn\u2019t done so and I\u2019m starting to wonder was I the asshole or was she? Perhaps I was too harsh and should\u2019ve been more careful with discussing it.", "created_utc": 1670873756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk8ys9/aita_for_snapping_at_my_friend_who_keeps_ditching/", "score": 3761, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She didn't ditch you. She asked you to go out with her friends as she'd made plans. She's not drinking like she's 20, she's drinking like someone who doesn't have a child.\n\n\n\nPS, she's right. Your partner can look after your daughter once in a while. And should do, to try and bond with her.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re always expecting her to accommodate you because you have a child. She\u2019s been coming over to your house for over a year because she understands your life has changed.\n\nYou\u2019re putting in very little effort and assuming that it\u2019s on her to maintain the friendship and compromise - why? Because you\u2019re a mom?\n\nShe didn\u2019t ditch you - you\u2019ve been a shitty friend for a while and she\u2019s probably done with you.", "YTA,\nAlso the \"Not to meddle in your marraige\" what are you on? He's a parent who can, ya know parent. It is not healthy to never socialise without your child, it's good for both of you.", "YTA she didn't ditch you on Saturday. She invited you to come with her and her other friends, meaning she had already committed to going out with other people. If she had come to yours for drinks, she would've been ditching her other friends.", "YTA. When you have a child, they are the most important person to you. BUT, that doesn\u2019t mean that they are the most important person to everyone else. Your a SAHM, that\u2019s your choice, and it sounds like Mia has tried really hard to be accommodating, but for Christ sakes, it\u2019s been two years of her doing things your way. She didn\u2019t ghost you or be rude, she suggested having your husband, the FATHER, watch your child so you can hang out and you yell at her an accuse her of meddling in your marriage? Girl, there\u2019s a lot of issues in your marriage in that statement alone that your not posting on here. Don\u2019t blame her for finally having enough and calling you an asshole cause you are acting like one. Don\u2019t expect her to apologize cause you don\u2019t deserve one. You want to keep this friendship, you talk to a therapist cause you\u2019ve got some issues, and when you are mature enough to have an adult conversation, call Mia and apologize.", "YTA. You refuse to do ANYTHING outside the home. She asks you constantly. You're evidently working on being a helicopter mom. At some point you need to leave the home and do something without your child. It's better for both of you.\n\nAnd you ditched her. Not the other way around.", "YTA. She\u2019s trying to stay engaged in your life, but you only want it 100% on your terms. She\u2019s not wrong for wanting to go out and have adult evenings out. Hire a sitter or ask your husband to take over for the night and join her. You were rude and out of line with her.", "You've made your entire friendship with Mia be about your kid and completely failed to acknowledge her POV or emotional needs. This is on you for neglecting the friendship, which REQUIRES time without a toddler around.\n\nYTA", "I can assure you that people in their 30s and 40s also sometimes drink like they\u2019re 20. Other than that, the others all said it well. YTA", "YTA.\n\n> This felt really intrusive\n\nWhy?  Because you *don\u2019t* have an answer for why your husband can\u2019t watch his own kid so you can have the occasional girls\u2019 night out that doesn\u2019t make him look bad?\n\nIf you really, truly do not want to do anything involving Mia that doesn\u2019t also involve Ciara, or that requires you to put any effort into going places, so be it.  But you really can\u2019t be surprised that\u2019s not going to work for her remotely as often as you\u2019re trying to push it - and maybe if you met her halfway a bit more often, she\u2019d be willing to do the same for you.  Assuming you can still salvage this, that is.", "Yes YTA!\n\nYour friend is not obligated to be around kids just because you had a child. It's not like she ignored you. She invited you out multiple times. Your entitlement that she should always hang out at your house around your kid is wrong.\n\nAlso, yes, she can go out and drink like she's in her 20s again. Maybe you should try that sometime too, instead of insisting to drink around a small child which majority of the people are not comfortable with.", "YTA. Your lifestyle choices are your own. Mia doesn\u2019t have to change her life to account for them. She is entitled to go out with her friends or generally live the way she wants to.", "YTA. You\u2019re so out of line, it\u2019s insane. You want everyone to accommodate you, so you can put in zero effort.", "YTA. It\u2019d be one thing if every once in a while you asked her to go to your place because of your child, even up to like half the time that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable accommodation. But if every time you\u2019ve hung out for 2 years it has to be at your house with your child I can totally understand why she\u2019s fed up with that. She wants to go out and do stuff. She wants to spend time with you child free. \n\nSaying \u201cif you don\u2019t want to spend time with me just tell me\u201d is immature and manipulative. It\u2019s very clear that she wants to spend time with you. She doesn\u2019t want to spend time with your child. And if you\u2019re not a single mom it\u2019s even more ridiculous of an ask because there is another parent who is perfectly capable of watching the child for a few hours. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re on your own and have to arrange child care.", "YTA. I say this as a mom. It's perfectly okay to leave your child with your partner to go hang out with friends occasionally. You don't have to make martyred motherhood your entire personality. It's pretty selfish to think she should *always* have to accommodate you and your inability to have a life outside of being a mom. The reality is you had a baby and now think your friends should cater to you without you making any effort. Friendships don't work that way.", "YTA\n\nI say this as a mother who has lost friends because I have a child, but people who don't want children, even if they are good around them, don't want to be around them all the time. She clearly does want to be friends with you, but that's the problem. She wants to be friends WITH YOU, not your child. Also, as someone who also works from home, it's important to be able to actually go out from time to time and going to someone else's house, doesn't always feel like actually going out. \n\n>She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she\u2019s 20 again.\n\nThis sounds like a little bit of jealousy, which I can respect. Having kids completely changes your life. She doesn't have kids though, or many other responsibilities it sounds like, so why can't she do these things? \n\nIt sounds like you are both just on different paths now, which happens. To be honest, asking if your partner could watch your kid doesn't seem like an intrusive comment, but your reaction potentially makes it seem like there are some issues in your relationship.\n\nWhy does she have to come over ALL the time? Why can't your partner watch his daughter as well? Do you just not want to go out? \n\nIt seems like you were projecting a lot of feelings onto Mia about some of your frustrations. Maybe you do need to get out more.", "YTA I'm afraid. Wanting a bit of variety after 18 months of only going to your place and only getting to hang out with the child also around is pretty reasonable. When does she ever get your undivided attention? Sounds like she's been exceptionally patient with the situation until recently, and I don't blame her for snapping.", "yes very much yes, YTA  \nyou are asking her to accommodate you, but you seems to forgot to accommodate her  \nshe didnt even ask you to go out and party, binge drinking and so on  \nbut sometime you can go out without your child and have some 'me' time as well  \nthat concept seems a lil lost to you it seems  \nthe fact that you keep declining her invitation is just plain rude, noone want to keep coming to your house to have a coffee  \nand the fact that you have the nerve to reprimanded her and actually scolded her  \nif she was me, yeah you are the friend that i wont mind ditching, not because you have kid, but because you seems to be wanting everyone to accommodate you while ignoring the others' need   \nheck you even get mad at her for suggesting your husband to care for the child once a while  \nthere's no perhaps here, you are harsh and very very rude", "YTA. It sounds like you are the one neglecting the friendship. You want to see her but only on your terms. You put all of the work on her. She has to come to you and can only do things that are child appropriate. If she dares to go out with other friends and do what she wants (making sure you know that you are welcome to join) you take it as a personal insult. I have a young child and I do understand that it is harder to go out than it used to be, but you could manage to do it occasionally if you actually valued her friendship. If for some reason you really can\u2019t ever go out, you should at least understand that she does not have that same limitation and isn\u2019t \u201cditching you\u201d if she doesn\u2019t come over on demand.", "YTA what\u2019s she supposed to do? Put her entire life on hold so she can cater to your neediness ? Get real", "YTA - She gave you 2 years to figure it out. You have seemingly decided you don\u2019t want to go out anymore and that\u2019s fine, but that no longer fits her idea of fun. If you want to remain friends you need to apologize and get someone to watch your kid every once and awhile.", "YTA - she wants to GO OUT AND HAVE FUN, not sit around. If you want to continue having her as a friend you had better find a way to get your hubby to parent for a while.\n\nShe's been pretty accommodating so far, but that ship has sailed. Find a compromise or kiss her good-bye. It's pretty revealing btw that you struck out at your family situation.", "YTA. You have a lot of guts to say shit like \"I told her she can come over whenever (*she works from home*)\" and \"she ditched me so she could drink like she's 20\" and my favorite \"I feel *neglected*\".\n\nYou have bene neglecting her! Why is your entire friendship about YOU and what YOU want?\n\nI can see why your friend group has shrunk since you had your kid.", "YTA.  Coming and sitting at your house with you and your kid is not fun.  Your friend doesn\u2019t want to do that and she\u2019s not unreasonable for feeling that way.  She isn\u2019t a married SAHM but that\u2019s what you make her act like in order to see you.  I wouldn\u2019t expect an apology from her.", "YTA - She is not neglecting you, she is just not bending over backwards to accommodate you. She wants to hang out with you. Not you and your kid.", "You very specifically asked if you're TA for snapping at her. Yes, YTA for that. You could've had a reasonable conversation with her without snapping. You like to be home with your daughter. She likes to be out. Your priorities are different at the moment, which sadly happens sometimes. You said she came over at first but rarely does now. How many times have you gone out with her, sans child? You have to compromise sometimes.", "YTA. she asked you out and you said no,  what else is she supposed to do?", "YTA big time and if you can't figure out why then I'm baffled.", "YTA.\n\nYou want her to accommodate your time and availability, but got mad and lashed out when she suggested your husband to watch the kid occasionly.\n\nVery entitled and disrespectful of your friend. Not everyone wants kids or is required to bend over backwards for yours", "YTA.\n\nShe has a right to hang out with her friend group by herself. She invited you, you declined. She\u2019s not obligated to stop her social life to sit up under you all day. You DO need to arrange to go out sometimes. \n\nYes, it\u2019s harder than pre-kid. \nYes, it requires more planning on your end.\nYes, it seems more inconvenient for you to do so.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s still a good friend to even continue to invite you. Especially since when she DID finally come over, all you did was berate her after she did what you asked her to do. You don\u2019t sound like much fun to be around at the moment.\n\nI mean this with no snark\u2014you might want to rule out post-partum depression and get treated if that\u2019s the case. Your reaction seems a bit unhinged and overly emotional/needy, and PPD can crop up up to two years after giving birth.", "YTA. It\u2019s sounds like you\u2019re projecting really. You have a kid so of course you can\u2019t do the things that she can. Drink like she\u2019s 20 again? Now that just makes you sound bitter. It\u2019s honestly a vibe kill to always be the one going to someone. I wouldn\u2019t want to always be going to my friends house if they had a kid. That gets old REAL quick. She is right. Your partner can watch the kid, so you can get out. I\u2019m not surprised she hasn\u2019t called. I would be if she called. Guess it\u2019s time to make some mom friends. Y\u2019all can take turns going to each other\u2019s houses.", "YTA. The only option for hanging out that you provide is at your house with a toddler around. Your friend doesn't want to do that, and you attacked her for it.", "YTA, why is your friendship so one sided? Why can't your partner or a babysitter watch Ciara at least one evening a month? You're selfish to expect constant accommodation, no wonder you don't have any friends, sheesh.", "YTA. \n\nOP it sounds like your friend is warning you that you\u2019re losing yourself in an unbalanced relationship. \n\nI thought you were a single parent but to find that you have a partner and always expect her to be around your child is a red flag. \n\nHire a babysitter. You are on the verge of losing your friend and your self.", "YTA. You have a kid. Mia does not have a kid. If Mia wants to go out and get drunk on a Saturday night, she has all the freedom in the world to do that. That's the benefit of not having kids. Your kid means your entire social life - how you spend your time, who with, and what you talk about - has changed. Mia's has not. She didn't have this kid with you. \n\nI have a 3 yo and I still cannot give my friends my full attention when they talk with my son nearby. We can't have focused, free flowing conversations because they are constantly interrupted. And the conversation - one way or another - always comes back around to the kid. And Mia - your BEST FRIEND - deserves to occasionally get your full and undivided attention, don't you think? She deserves to go to coffee shops, bars, restaurants with her best friend like she did pre-Ciara. Not all the time, but SOME times. If you can't find a way to do that for her, to show her that her needs matter, she'll simply find someone else who can.", "Yta. It's clear you aren't putting any effort into your friendship with Mia. You complain she is neglecting you, but what effort have you made to accommodate her? None. You expect her to come to your house, and will only see her if she comes to your house. You expect her to be the first to reach out to apologise after a conflict. You see her has interfering when she makes a completely normal suggestion that your Co parent take a shift alone with your kid so you can spend one evening being an adult without kid in tow. Heck, you won't even tow the kid to a cafe.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t want to see you with your kid all the time (who likely interrupts and distracts you for most of the time). You also probably always revert the conversation to your kid, based off how you frame your post.", "Wow, YTA big time. She's been accommodating you for 2 years and is more than enough. Everyone understands that having a baby takes time and specially the first year it usually takes a lot of work and adjustments for the parents so catering to them and help them is kind of expected. But two years in you have a toddler, not a baby. And she's not telling you to abandon your family to roam the world. She's asking for an adult interaction that doesn't revolve around your motherhood. Going for a coffee while the dad watches the kid is normal. Having a night out even if you go home early is healthy. And lashing at her for suggesting that the father could do some parenting? There're two assholes in this story and Mia is none of them.", "YTA. For heaven's sake, the child's father can be left alone with your baby surely? She seems to have offered to meet up with you several times and I completely understand that spending time in your home with a baby around would not be appealing. You'll be constantly distracted and preoccupied.\n\nAfter the way you spoke to her, YOU need to be calling HER to apologise for kicking her out. Hopefully she will forgive you.\n\nIf you're lonely and need company there will be a local mothers group that probably meets at homes that you could join.", "YTA.\n\nShe isn\u2019t neglecting you, you are neglecting her. She has been more than reasonable to accommodate you. Have you ever considered, \u201chey maybe I should do want she wants to do for once\u201d\n\nJust because you are a mom now, doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to bend over backwards to do what you want to do.\n\nAlso, she is right, your partner can watch the kid for once. If he can\u2019t, you are in a very awful relationship.\n\nEdit: also my ex-friend did the same crap you did. Guess what, we aren\u2019t friends anymore. Moreover, she lost all the friends in life, because she never realized that she sometimes should accommodate her friends.", "YTA. It\u2019s you that\u2019s failing to accommodate Mia, not the other way around. You\u2019ve made it worse by doubling down. You\u2019ve made it worse still by having the temerity and lack of self awareness to chastise her. If you want to preserve the friendship, suck it up, apologize, and find a way to get an afternoon off from your kid. And coffee and pizza should be your treat.", "YTA: you had a huge life change, which means your relationships with others change too. You criticize how your friend spends her time whilst demanding she constantly accommodate to your  life. How is that fair? Friendship is a two way street and right now it looks like your friend makes all the effort in the relationship while you just make demands.", "YTA I can understand your perspective but your friend is making considerable effort to be your friend and have an adult friendship with you. And you're essentially saying the only way she can see you is with a kid around who you are always giving half your attention to. Some of that is inevitable but it sounds like you're not willing to meet her halfway at all and let Tom take care of her for a night to let the two of you have some time together as friends. If you want a friend to always hang out with your kids I wouldn't do that with someone who doesn't want kids, and probably isn't interested in spending a ton of time with them.", "The lives of people who have kids become centered around those kids. People who don't want kids don't want to ALWAYS be around kids. You always expected her to be accommodating you, but friendship is a two way street. You two just have different lives now. Time to find new friends.", "YTA. She is child free and doesn\u2019t always want to be around a child. It wouldn\u2019t hurt you to make an effort for her as well. Your friendship is one sided. You think she should drop everything and everyone for you but you can\u2019t take an hour to go to her. She deserves a better friend", "YTA you don\u2019t compromise on anything. Maybe take a break and have your partner watch the child so you can go out with your friends. You act like you cannot leave your house, and yes, that gets old to others. Just because you have a kid doesn\u2019t mean your friend has to bend to all your ways.", "YTA\n\nYou decided to have a child.  She didn't.  So she doesn't owe you rearranging her social life to make it match yours. Particularly when you get offended at the suggestion that you could rearrange yours to join her. \n\nIf you don't want to go out anymore, that's fine.  But if she doesn't want to come to your house and hang out with your kid, that's also fine.  You don't get to berate her for that perfectly reasonable choice. \n\nStop waiting for an apology.  You are the one who owes an apology. \n\nAnd then get your husband to watch the kid while you take your friend out for drinks. Not just because she deserves it for putting up with this nonsense, but also because being home with a kid all the time takes its toll on everyone, and it's clearly taking a toll on you.", "YTA, did you even notice that you expect her to cater exclusively to your needs? You never compromised. You never got a sitter or your partner to watch your kid. You just want her always to come to your house\u2026that\u2019s selfish. Maybe she needs to see something else, maybe she needs a break from being home/at someones home, maybe she needs an adult talk without an interrupting toddler. You are so focused on yourself that you forgot to be a friend.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like Mia has made a *genuine effort* to include you, to invite you to do things, and to be your friend. However, you refuse to do so unless it\u2019s on *your* terms at *your* home. \n\nShe\u2019s absolutely right that your husband can watch your child for a few hours while you go out for coffee or dinner. Your refusal to even consider asking him do so, however, means that you will continue to miss out on things.

Nothing wrong with that.  You're a 2 year broken record of sitting at home with a cup of tea.  She's done with that.  She wants to go to a cafe or dinner with you.  She's been asking you nonstop for a year at this point, right?\n\n\"And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off...This felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage...I was really angry with her and kicked her out.\"\n\nBoom.

She doesn\u2019t have to change for you and it sounds like she\u2019s been the only one compromising and making an effort while you can\u2019t even meet her for coffee, and you think SHE\u2019S the bad friend?\n\nYTA", "YTA. You can\u2019t expect to have all of your friends, especially those who are child free, to be happy with always being kid friendly and coming to your house.\n\nIt\u2019s actually not healthy that you never seem to be able to go do adult stuff. Why can\u2019t your husband watch the kid while you go out for a night? I get that you\u2019re a SAHM but you also deserve off time where you\u2019re not attached to a toddler.\n\nIf you want friends you\u2019re going to either need to stick with other parents or start being more flexible.", "YTA, being friends is a two-way street, not always accommodating to you and the new baby.", "She didn\u2019t ditch you, she went to the thing that you were also invited to but declined to attend. You could have hired a babysitter if you wanted to go. Or, if you\u2019d rather stay home, then you can find friends that share that as an interest. You can\u2019t expect other people to alter their lifestyle just because yours has changed.", "YTA.  She invites you and you can't go.  And you yell at her after she does agree to come.\n\n\"I shouted at her that she\u2019s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around\"\n\nYou got your answer.

You're lifestyles don't mesh anymore and you should probably not ve surprised if she doesn't call back to apologize.", "Yta why can\u2019t your husband watch the kid sometimes?", "YTA, she\u2019s put effort in and you haven\u2019t. Not everyone wants to spend all their time around little children and it\u2019s not up to her to always come to you. If you want a friendship then you can actually put some effort in and show that it means something. If I was her I would\u2019ve just cut you off and no it\u2019s not your kid, it\u2019s you and your behaviour.", "YTA- YOU had a child, so yes your life changes- but you can\u2019t require your friend to change her life. It sounds like she\u2019s tried to accommodate you, but you don\u2019t even try to spend adult time with her. She\u2019s right, you can let the child stay with dad and have a night out or lunch with friends occasionally. You\u2019re not even trying- you want everyone to accommodate you.", "I say this as someone who went through this when I started having kids. You\u2019re being a bad friend. Your friends may adore your child, that still doesn\u2019t mean they want to be around her every time they hang out with you. Your child is not their responsibility and if they want to go out and have drinks at a bar, as adults they absolutely can and it\u2019s not a slight against your daughter. It sounds like she still tries include you, but you don\u2019t want to make an effort and expect her to come to you always, that\u2019s not how friendship works. YTA, but you\u2019re still a new mom and you\u2019ll figure it out.", "YTA friendship is a two way street and it sounds like your friend is tired of hanging out with your child if she wants to hang out with you.

And FYI I have kids of my own.", "YTA, hun you need to give time for your yourself, have some adult time, remind you are not just a mother you are also an adult women, my mother use to be like you,  and to be honest that's one of the reasons why I'm childfree, your kid needs to see that motherhood is more than just staying at home all the time", "YTA. You expect her to change her lifestyle and accommodates you 100% of the time. You are not willing to compromise. Having a kid doesn\u2019t entitle you to make people spend 100% of the time with you, with your child as well.", "YTA - it sounds like you are blowing her off far more than she is blowing you off.  Why can your partner no watch the child so you can go out?  Why can you not get a babysitter.   Honestly, if the only time you want to see her is on your terms, and with your child around, I can understand her being fed up.  You are the one who owes her an apology.", "YTA. Sorry but she\u2019s right - in two whole years your husband couldn\u2019t watch the baby once so you can have child free time with her? I\u2019m a mom of two by the way, so I understand it\u2019s hard to get out but that\u2019s not Mia\u2019s fault. And also sorry but it is weird to go drink at a friend\u2019s house while that friend is parenting a child and only half listening to you. I\u2019ve had that experience before kids, it\u2019s not fun.", "YTA. She hasn\u2019t ditched you at all, she\u2019s gone out of her way to invite you out. Your response is always to decline and try and force her to come hang out at your place. Clearly, she\u2019s not interested in doing that. \n\nA lot of my friends had kids, and one of them was just like you. She dropped out of college (we both had been attending together, later in life) once she got pregnant. She didn\u2019t want to do anything but stay in the house with the kid. I tried going over a few times but it was always awkward; the place was a mess and she just dumped the kid on me and used it as an opportunity to clean up the house. Her husband was useless and made her give up on her life and dreams to take care of the kids. After the second kid was born we drifted apart and I haven\u2019t spoken with her in years. \n\nWhat do you offer to your friend? What is it you bring to the table now in this friendship? If it\u2019s just stuff about your kid, you need to get a new set of mom martyr friends, or change your priorities.", "YTA. Friendship has to be a two way street. You want a friendship that is on your terms only. That is unreasonable. The people around you should not have to change because you changed.", "YTA She invites you out but you want her to come to you. She doesn\u2019t want to constantly be around a toddler take the hint. Your feeling neglected in your friendship and you don\u2019t have any time for yourself she\u2019s right ask your husband to watch his kid alone for a couple of hours so you can have an adult friendship.", "YTA. \n\nI laughed out loud, reading the paragraph about Mia inviting OP out for drinks with a group of other ladies, and OP said no, you ditch the other people you already have plans with and hang at my house instead. Then she felt vicrimized about the photos posted online. LOL, entitled much?", "YTA. How is she ditching you at all? She's invited you out several times and you refused. You choosing to have a kid doesn't mean others need to cater to you.", "YTA. No reason you can\u2019t get a sitter and go out.

You should be mindful that not everyone wants to spend time around young children, especially when they do not have children of their own. And you shouldn't consider this anything against you or your family.  Your friend wants to spend time with you and sometimes that means without your child.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s not Mia\u2019s responsibility to make sure your needs are satisfied. There is NO reason why the baby\u2019s father can\u2019t watch her while you go out with friends. Or why you can\u2019t hire a babysitter for a night.

You seriously can\u2019t leave the house for a few hours? \n\n\nYou\u2019re going to be really lonely when your kid grows up and you\u2019re left with nobody but your peach s/o who can\u2019t even be bothered to help parent his own kid. And it\u2019s going to be your own damn fault.", "YTA. You are also wrong. She has no obligation to accommodate you. Even though she clearly does occasionally. Which sounds boring as hell. \nAs a parent, I am going to level with you. The last thing I want to do is hang out with someone else\u2019s kids. If I invite someone out for dinner or drinks or whatever, and they suggest I come to theirs to sit with them and their kids, (barring extenuating circumstances) I will tell them know. I did not find childcare to just put up with someone else\u2019s kid. And based on your over the top reaction to her pointing out that your partner can parent too, I think this is not the first time that has been suggested. \n\nI have lost friends as we all had children. But typically the loss came when one of the new parents made the mistake of feeling like having a child made their time more valuable than anyone else\u2019s. \n\nYou need to apologize, and hope she has not decided that you are not worth the trouble you try to cause.", "Yta. Always going to your house can be boring. You expect her to always be at your house when you both want to hang out. She wants to hang out at a different place. You can do that. You can take your child with you or let the child stay with your partner so that you can have a good time together. You ruined your own friendship because of  that. She is not tah, you are the AH", "YTA expecting to your friend to only visit with you under your terms is unfair. She is correct you should be making an attempt to get out of the house without your child if you want to maintain friendships. It's not even about your friend not having a child. Other parents also enjoy going out without their children.\nYou can't expect her to always cater to you. There should be some compromises.", "Completely and wholly YTA. Your friend was making compromises to come visit you and always asked if you wanted a change of scenery. Did you ever stop to think maybe she was trying to get you out of the house for an hour or two for a change of scenery and some mental healthcare?

Some of the biggest challenges with being a SAHP is balancing a social life and dealing with isolation. You are now in a different life phase than your previous circle, including Mia, and it\u2019s going to be harder for them to connect with you given that. \n\nIt sounds like you have been overly demanding and one-sided by constantly expecting Mia to come to your house, when it\u2019s clear she does not find that enjoyable. It also sounds like you are projecting your frustration and loneliness onto her, when that is not her responsibility. Basically you don\u2019t seem to care about Mia\u2019s feelings, only yours, and that\u2019s not sustainable in a friendship. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to push Mia away, then you need to meet her where she\u2019s at, and get out of the house once in awhile.

They scream, cry, and are a huge distraction for parents to consistently be like: \u201cHold on, I have to get her a snack,\u201d \u201cHold on she needs comfort\u201d and whatnot. It seems like you\u2019re neglecting your friend. It\u2019s understandable you have responsibilities, but it comes with you needing to understand that your husband can watch her for a few hours.

Or, yeah I\u2019m multitasking and it\u2019s easy to add you to that list. \n\nI just felt like she only wanted to hang when it was convenient for her to multitask and likely she was reserving her precious time for other friends or guys. I\u2019d even offer to go to kid friendly places but she would never accept. \n\nI gave her many passes initially when she\u2019d forget our plans or cancel (typically bc of work, not her kids) because she\u2019s essentially a single mom, but that mixed with feeling used just led to us not talking as much.", "YTA not everyone wants to sit around on a couch and watch a wild toddler play/scream.

Maybe you should explore why you're so angry that she's not limiting herself to solely being stuck in the house with you, or like you.

Why should she cancel her plans with others if you aren\u2019t available? That\u2019s getting possessive! You have zero right to be upset about that.

It\u2019s probably upsetting you because you\u2019re lonely, which is understandable because 2 year olds are hardly interesting conversationalists!  Sounds like you also had a kid mid-pandemic, so going out can feel foreign to you.  Fix that! Get out more with adults! I\u2019m a single mom with full custody and I still figure that out, because it\u2019s important for everyone\u2019s mental health! \n\nShe is right, kiddo has a whole dad to care for her while you have some adult time! If you don\u2019t want to do that for whatever reason, fine, but you can\u2019t get upset that your friend doesn\u2019t want to go your house daily, watch her mouth, and give all focus to your kid. She want to talk to YOU!! She misses YOU and has been trying to get just you out, but you refuse. She has been TRYING and you yelled at her! \n\nThis is on you sis, you\u2019re majorly projecting your frustrations and expecting too much from your friend.

Initially this was the story of two friends in two different stages of life.  Relationships ebb and flow - sometimes we're more in contact than other times depending on what is happening in our lives.  Sometimes those relationships change as we find other people with more common interests or lifestyles and drift a little from others.\n\nBut then you decided to take her not joining the mommy-lifestyle and wanting to do things that don't involve a kid she neither birthed nor adopted herself as a personal affront to you and you became TA instead of accepting that you're in two different stages of life and you may have to try to meet in the middle or alternate plans to accommodate those stages.  And honestly, there's a bit of a judgmental tone in your post (especially when you say \"so she could go and drink like she\u2019s 20 again\") as if you somehow believe you're above those kinds of plans anymore and the way she spends her time is beneath you.\n\nI also fail to see how her comment is \"meddling\" in your marriage - she was just pointing out that your child has two parents so you should be able to have time away every now and then.  The fact that you became so defensive and called this meddling makes me think she struck a nerve and there's some issues there to work out.", "YTA. Mia works from home and then, you expect her to just go to another home to hang out. \n\nI don't think she's asking you to go out drinking every weekend.

How often do you invite her over without her initiating contact? \n\nI don't understand why you'd be upset that she went and had a good time with other friends? She didn't ditch you, she tried to include you and you said no. It's not like you had plans and she cancelled in order to go out with other friends. It's not surprising that a group of people who wanted a night out didn't want to hang out at someone's home with a child present when the goal was to let loose.  \n\nIt's not unreasonable that Mia wants to spend time with you without your child on occasion or to suggest that Tom could give you a break. If you're not ready to be away from your Ciara for a few hours yet, then that's your prerogative, however, Mia isn't an asshole for wanting to spend time with her friend, (you), without having to filter herself because there's a child present.\n\nA discussion seems warranted. If you're not ready to be away from your child, own that. But it's also not entirely fair that you expect your friends to only see you on your terms or to rearrange their plans to accommodate you. Especially those that have made an effort to do just that. Balance is a good thing. If Mia has been the one coming over and you haven't made any effort to just go get a coffee or do something with her that doesn't involve your daughter, that's not offering any accommodation to her. \n\nObviously your daughter is your priority and should be, however, it's usually healthier to maintain something of your life that is independent of your child and your partner. A lot of women sort of lose themselves in motherhood. Mia is likely trying to help you with that, which is indicative of a good friend. If she has the impression that Tom might not be pulling his weight, why wouldn't she look out for you? If Tom is an active and involved father, great, but if you're not indicating it's *your* choice to never go out, that's actually not entirely fair to him either because it would be very easy for a friend to assume that he's not being supportive of you having something of your own life. I would be concerned for any new-ish mom that didn't take time for themself too. Most of my friends with kids start wanting to get out a bit by the time their kiddo is around 18 mos. If staying home all the time is what they want, great, but often not getting out as a SAHM is a result of people not being considerate of the labor it takes to be one. \n\nI think you owe Mia an apology if you want to continue the friendship.

She's not trying to drink around your child, or curse around them excessively, I understand you've been feeling excluded but she's not actively doing so, she's making an attempt to keep you around and even asked if your husband could watch the child so you two could come out once. Chances are she'll cut her losses and just stop trying with you altogether.", "YTA and also incredibly selfish.", "YTA.

However I think he's not as happy about your unplanned pregnancy as you are and therefore does little to no interaction with Ciara which is why you're so desperately clinging to Mia. YTA for only telling half the story and for blaming Mia when obviously your problems are with the reluctant BD! Mia owes you absolutely NOTHING but your freedom to lie in that bed you made so inconveniently to babytrap Tom.

Sometimes it\u2019s hard for child free people to feel comfortable around children, not because they don\u2019t like them, but because the flow of the conversation changes. I remember hating going to my friends\u2019 with kids homes because we just couldn\u2019t get through a conversation without being interrupted by the child. My friends would understand that and we\u2019d all make an effort to meet in the middle, sometimes in their homes, sometimes out without kids.

Mia doesn\u2019t have kids nor wants kids but she\u2019s been brilliant with Ciara.\n\nI\u2019m a SAHM and obviously don\u2019t have as much time to hang out as I did previously. Mia and I live on the same street (we\u2019re in Manchester, England) and it\u2019s a walking distance between our houses. I\u2019ve told Mia numerous times that she can just pop in whenever she wants to (she works from home) but she rarely does. \n\nShe did at the beginning but it\u2019s been happening less and less. Instead, she keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or pizza or even a drink but I don\u2019t have the time and always just tell her to come over and we\u2019ll have coffee at my place.\n\nShe asked if I wanted to go out with her and her other friends for a drink last weekend but I said that no but she\u2019s welcome to come over and we\u2019ll have a few drinks at mine. She said she already had plans and it felt weird to drink when she knows there\u2019s a child around. \n\nHonestly, I feel neglected. I feel like she put me on a back burner and doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. I\u2019m always available but she rarely comes over and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\n\nToday, I saw her photos from Saturday night out and I was fuming. She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she\u2019s 20 again. I felt rejected and horrible, I thought we were best friends but she clearly doesn\u2019t value me when she won\u2019t even have a few drinks with me at my house.\n\nWhen she finished work, she called and asked if I fancied going for coffee to town but I asked her to come over again. She said yes but before she disconnected, I heard her mumble \u201clike always.\u201d This really annoyed me.\n\nWhen she came over, I decided to be open about everything. And while not my proudest or most mature moment, I shouted at her that she\u2019s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around.\n\nShe said she\u2019s always been accommodating but it\u2019s been 2 years and she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me when there\u2019s always a kid, especially now when she has to watch her language (Mia likes to swear).\n\nI said that she knew I had a child and responsibilities. And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off.\n\nThis felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage. \n\nI was really angry with her and kicked her out. She called me a selfish asshole on her way out.\n\nNormally, I would expect her to call by now with apologies but she hasn\u2019t done so and I\u2019m starting to wonder was I the asshole or was she? Perhaps I was too harsh and should\u2019ve been more careful with discussing it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA, are you not taking the hints??? She doesn\u2019t want to sit in your house with your kid. She wants you to tell your partner \u201c I\u2019m going out\u201d and for you all to actually enjoy yourselves. Yes it\u2019s nice to stay in once in awhile but not every time you hangout. Obviously everyone else is child free for a reason so why would they want to hang around yours? If you want friends start putting more effort into the friendship and leave your kid at home with dad.\n\nEdit to add: you also have to remember you\u2019re a parent now so you stop getting invited to things as well. She\u2019s trying to be inclusive the best she can but she\u2019s not going to stop her fun on your kids behalf. My cousin is 23 and his first kid is due in March. It was an accident and he\u2019s devastated. His friends are having a \u201clast big night out\u201d party for him in February since he won\u2019t be able to do all the things his friends will be doing now. It\u2019s that parenting life dear!", "YTA. This is pretty much what being a mom is. Welcome to the club.", "YTA. Plenty of parents manage to spend an afternoon or evening or even just a couple of hours away from their kid to spend time with a treasured adult friend. Sounds like you haven\u2019t made any effort at all. Having coffee or a drink with you at your home while you\u2019re not fully present, distracted with kid stuff, and likely blathering on about your kid 90% of the time isn\u2019t quality time for Mia. And if you were honest with yourself you would realize that and try to make an effort to contribute to the friendship.", "YTA. She shouldn\u2019t always accommodate you, she\u2019s allowed to not always want to be around children. She probably thinks you\u2019re neglecting her because you refuse to leave you baby with your partner for even an hour", "YTA, you\u2019re making everything about you", "YTA, if your life changed by having a child, hers doesn't have to. Plus, she's right, if you couldn't've gotten your husband to stay with your kid to go out once in two years, what do you expect? Ah yes, you expect an apology, lol", "YTA your friend has been more than accommodating and you seem to be putting in exactly 0 effort into occasionally reciprocating. I'm childfree and have friends with kids, there have been times where someone has had to bring one out to lunch with us and that's fine, but if that was going to be the case every single time for 2 years I'd start to pull away from that friendship too. \n\nShe has no reason to apologize and I hope she doesn't.\n\nThere's also something funny about you writing \"I\u2019m always available but she rarely comes over and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\" but then this whole post is littered with you talking about how busy you are. You're the one being neglectful in this relationship.", "As a fellow SAHM, YTA. I\u2019m sorry, I know how hard and lonely it can be. But your friend had not abandoned you. She kept reaching out, inviting you places and even when she didn\u2019t want to, she came over. Yes, it wasn\u2019t as often as you liked, but she did. She was a good friend and she\u2019s correct, your partner absolutely could and SHOULD pitch in and watch your baby so that you can go out. She\u2019s the one constantly having to accommodate, not you. \n\nLife as a hermit is lonely.", "YTA. I\u2019m childless and almost 40. Guess what, most of my girlfriends that have kids, aren\u2019t my friends anymore because they behaved just like you.  I have a few friends left that have kids. We are friends because they fully get that them having kids doesn\u2019t mean our friendship revolves around their kids. I have no issues hanging out at a friend\u2019s home because they may have a sitter issue or can\u2019t get a sitter frequently. And I love their kids and attend their birthdays and other events sometimes. But I\u2019m an adult and I want to do adult things. What I do expect is some sort of compromise because that\u2019s what relationships are.\n\nWhat you have is incredibly one sided. Mia tried for two years to maintain your friendship while you did zero. I have zero sympathy for you when you couldn\u2019t manage to meet your friend 1 time outside your home in 18 months. You are expecting your friends to cater to you because you popped a watermelon out of your vagina. Guess what, it doesn\u2019t make you special and doesn\u2019t exempt you from working to maintain friendships. I\u2019m sure your friend is happy to come and hang out at your house sometimes and talk about your kid. But she\u2019s also entitled to go out to bars with friends and talk about men or women or hobbies or whatever else she wants to.

It\u2019s good for Mia to go out from a developmental standpoint and you can also get out of your house with your friend. \n\nYou can\u2019t expect everyone to just come to your house and do what you want.

It doesn\u2019t mean your friends have to change the way they live there lives. She doesn\u2019t seem like she excludes you from invites, even when you can\u2019t/don\u2019t want to make them. It totally makes sense that someone without a kid and does not want kids wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with a kid everytjme they want to hang out with you. That\u2019s an unrealistic expectation. She is right. You can ask your partner or a family member to watch your daughter once in a while to get coffee or grab dinner or a drink with your friend. I would offer to trade with her on going out or staying in.", "YTA, and your friend is 100% right.  Your child is not the center of the universe and you should not be forcing her on your friends!\nYou should absolutely spend time with your friend without your daughter.  It\u2019s healthy to have some adult time.  Do you have access to a babysitter?  I suggest you call and apologize now and fix this or you will have no friends at all", "YTA, sorry.\n\nShe's right; it is, in fact, weird to day drink around a toddler.  She's allowed to live her life, and I don't see any efforts you're making to go spend time with her.", "YTA it really sounds like you expect her to do all the heavy lifting in the friendship. The fact you started a fight and kicked her out but expected her to apologize shows what a bad friend you are. It sounds like a one sided friendship where she was always catering to you. Good for her for standing up to you and realizing you are a selfish friend", "YTA !!! \n\nNot saying every situation is the same but , this isn\u2019t healthy! you cant have atleast some time away from your child? you have 100% of child care? do you have any means of income if anything goes wrong? \n\nto each its own but, in a couple of years when you dont have a social life, your husband is not pulling his weight .. i hope you get a \u2018i told you so\u2019. unless you change your behavior to have a balance.

They require time and effort to maintain and flourish.  What you have clearly indicted through your actions is that she only is a friend at your convenience and never absent your kid.  Yes, you can\u2019t expect a mom to be as free with their time as they were pre-kid, but it is equally as unrealistic to expect a friend put up with only ever seeing you with a kid present, meaning you are getting, at best, 50% attention.  \n\nIt seems like you friend tried, but got sick of only traveling on your one way street.", "YTA your friend makes it very clear she wants to spend time with you but you always decline her offers and suggest she come to you. This is a one sided relationship and you are not the victim. Do you ever leave the house? Go live your life. It's not unreasonable to leave your child with your husband or a responsible adult so that you can get a break. Why are you so adamant that she must come to your place to see you? She's clearly bored when she's there. Why would she sacrifice what little time we have on this earth to be bored out of her skull just so you can get some attention? Very selfish mindset.

She probably feels like you put her on the backburner because you're unwilling to ever get a sitter or ask the father to do his job and watch the kid and frankly, I don't blame her.\n\nFriendships almost always change after a kid comes into the equation, but you've also done literally nothing to try and maintain it in a healthy manner. If you apologize and try and meet her half way you might be able to salvage to friendship, but this very easily could have been the last straw for her.", "Yta. I get out once maybe twice a week, I don\u2019t want to spend that at someone else\u2019s house. I\u2019m at my own enough. I want to go OUT.", "YTA.  She can always come to you,but you can never go to her,because TiMe.  You can\u2019t make time for her!  Suggesting your husband take a night of childcare is NOT meddling in your marriage.  She is an adult and wants to do adult things.  If being a mother has consumed your life,your friendship may have run its course.", "YTA. \n\nYour kid is 1.5 years old - you are WELL out of the newborn/infant phase where it is 100% reasonable to expect anyone who wants to see you needs to come to you. \n\nWhile it would be unreasonable of Mia to expect you to constantly be free to go out the way you were pre-child, that doesn't sound like that's what is happening here. \n\nAt this point, you're either not leaving Ciara because you have a deadbeat partner who won't take care of her on his own OR you just simply don't want to leave Ciara and you expect Mia and your other friends to accommodate this indefinitely. \n\nSo - which is it? \n\nAlso, look - having been the childfree person who has visited my friends at their home because it was the only way to see them... hanging out with your friends while they're in \"parent\" mode, *especially* when the kids are toddlers, is not really quality time. And honestly, not really that much fun. \n\nIt's fun to play with the kids for a few minutes, ooh and ahh over their latest artwork or whatever, but beyond that, trying to have actual quality time with your friends becomes impossible - if we manage two minutes of uninterrupted talk, it's a miracle. \n\nIt's still worth doing if that's the only way to see them, but I'm absolutely not going to be over there all the time. At some point, effort has to be made to get out of the house - and you are WELL beyond that point.", "YTA.\nIf you want to see your friends, you're going to get to make that effort.\nYou don't get special privileges or accomodations by the whole world all the time because you chose to have a kid.\nNobody owes you their time, and you cannot expect to dictate other people's time and expect good results. \nTBH, your friend group has moved beyond you because y'all don't have very much in common anymore. It's time to go find some friends you have commonality with, such as other moms.\nGood luck to you! I do know how hard it is, I'm a mom myself.\n\ud83d\udda4\nEdited to add: it's not that you are unliked, it's that people who don't have kids often don't want to sit around with a kid and watch them play.

She called me a selfish asshole on her way out.\n\nI probably would have called you more than that on my way out if I were in her shoes, honestly. You are acting like a petulant child having a temper tantrum when everything isn't going exactly the way you want it. She's been much more accommodating than most people would be, and she shouldn't be expected to just come over to your house for some lame ass coffee around your kid all the time. \n\nI'm REALLY curious why her mentioning your partner taking over parental duties once in a while was so triggering for you.

Your partner SHOULD be spending time with your child, alone. Whether you go out, or just spend some time not being a parent, it doesn't matter, but he should be doing that regularly. \nYou are a horrible friend and seem to think the world should revolve around your child. It doesn't.", "Yes. YTA.", "YTA. Not everyone wants to spend all their free time sitting at home, or at someone else's home constantly around a toddler. She invites you to go out with her frequently. YOU are the one saying no. You don't get to shame her for spending time acting Ike an adult", "YTA. She went out on a Saturday night to enjoy herself  - she did not ditch you. There were no plans made to ditch! \n\nYour entire emotional response is based on the hurt you are feeling because you want your friend. Your emotions are fair - it's hard dealing with life changes like this. \n\nHowever your friends have the right to not always be around you AND baby. Plus if they never get time with you alone, it really sucks. Especially going into the second year of the kid's life, as they don't require around the clock care, breastfeeding is usually less often too, and generally easier to care for in many ways. Your friends see this and wonder \"when will I have my friend back?\" \n\nAs much as children are a joy, hanging out with a mom and her kid means that your friend is sidelined *every single time* you interact with your kid. It gets tiring and sometimes adults want to hang out with adults and not kids - especially those of us without children. It doesn't matter if you like kids or not, if it's not your normal to always have a child around it is something that can get tiring. Especially when you want to tell your friend something without being interrupted every 10 seconds. \n\nMake a game plan with your husband so you both get a night out at least once a week with friends away from the kid/house. Remind yourself that you are a person that your friends care about and want to interact with directly. Your friend is showing she's hurting because you aren't around, will you make some time for her?

Honestly, you're not entitled to peiples friendship.", "YTA. \n\nLook... priorities change. As a child free woman, when I was in my 20s and early 30s my friends didn't have time to do the things that we previously did together. That was fine! And some times we did things with their kids involved. And that was fine! Now that their kids are are older, you know that ones I still get together with? The ones that occasionally still made time to do things just us when the kids were little. The ones that went all in on their kids and were unwilling to do things without them or, like you, were only willing to see me if I came to their house?

SAHM is one of the most challenging jobs there is. \n\nWith that being said,\n\nYou neglected your friend by giving her one alternative to see you, instead of showing any kind of support or interest in her life. 2 years is a long time to not make plans with someone who you consider your closest friend. She deserves a major apology and - if there\u2019s any shred of a friendship left - you try to salvage it and start making time for yourself outside of your home.", "YTA, sounds like you are the one neglecting her. From your post, it seems like she tries to include you all the time, but you says no due to it being outside your home. Why can't you get a babysitter once in a while or have your partner be home with the baby while you to go out for dinner and drinks or just coffee? There is a big difference going out and to have drinks at your home, especially with the kid at home, why is she the one having to compromise all the time and then getting yelled at when she does come to your home \n\n\nI guarantee she would be so more open to be at your home, if you would also compromise and show that you wanted her.", "YTA and quite holier than thou. It sounds like your friend has been trying to include you in things, and she\u2019s reaching out and encouraging you to leave the house sometimes. She values your company. Yes, a child is a lot of responsibility, but they don\u2019t need to be your entire identity. Also the way you said she\u2019s going out drinking \u201clike she\u2019s 20\u201d um any adult can go out drinking. No need to treat her like it\u2019s some immature thing to do. Since it\u2019s harder for you to have fun, then she shouldn\u2019t either? \n\nThe way you were talking, I assumed you were a single parent - but you\u2019re married? What\u2019s wrong with him watching the kid for a while so you can be social? If he married you he should have known child rearing would be part of the deal. \n\nYou\u2019re being very rude to your friend who has clearly tried hard to keep the friendship alive. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll stop reaching out to you now though, since you seem set on being a bitter parent and a stick in the mud.", "YTA. She's making a lot of effort to include you I'm things, hang out and spend time with you, but you seem to shoot down every suggestion and insist she come to your house if she wants to see you. She's right: your partner should be able to handle watching a child for a few hours so you can spend time with someone who is so important to you.\n\nSuck it up, call her and apologize and understand if she doesn't want to spend time with you for a while.", "OP, YTA.  Why should she always have to come to your home?  Why can\u2019t you go out and meet with her and her other friends?", "YTA. Just because your kid is your whole life doesn\u2019t mean it has to be everyone else\u2019s as well. I thought you were a single mother until the end of the post. Your husband needs to step up and watch the kid from time to time.", "YTA. You\u2019re putting very little effort into your relationship with her, but expecting her to bend over backwards. Why can\u2019t your partner watch the kid? Why are you expecting her to cancel her plans to come hangout at your house? Your life may revolve around your child, but hers does not.", "Yep, soft YTA. I get that you\u2019re a new mom, but even parents need time off. You\u2019re acting so provincial about this, too. You better believe I found someone to watch my kid so I could feel like a human being again.", "NTA. She wants you to go out and drink at the club like when you were single And not a mother. You have out grown her.", "Were you raised to believe it's wrong or evil or unnatural for SAHMs to go out without their children for a night out with the girls? You're allowed to leave your house! Her father can watch her. If your partner refuses to share responsibility for his kid and forbids you from leaving the house, get help and get away.\n\nOtherwise, YTA. Your friends keep inviting you, and you keep refusing.", "YTA\n\nBeing a SAHP doesn't mean you can't leave the house only with your kids. Or not at all. When my son was the age of your daughter, I took him with me to a friend's house or restaurant all the time. Or he stayed at home with his dad and I went out alone.", "YTA. You ditched her not the other way around. You can\u2019t be jealous when she invited you and you said no. It\u2019s not her fault you have a kid, nor is it her responsibility to work around. It\u2019s your problem. Stop making her solve it.", "YTA but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to apologize or blame, sometimes people grow apart after life altering events like having a child. It\u2019s noones fault it just happens. She doesn\u2019t have to want to be around your kid and you do t have to leave your kid alone to go and be with your friend in public. Decide what\u2019s worth more and go from there. People don\u2019t have to be friends forever.", "Definitely the AH. Having a kid around all the time would get old, especially because adults have to watch their tongues. I don\u2019t like kids and someone who would constantly keep pushing their child into the equation of my friendship with said person\u2026nah. Also, she\u2019s not an \u201cawful\u201d person for having wants and needs that you cannot help. She has a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around you and your offspring. \n\n\nYTA.", "YTA.  When was she was giving you options, what she was trying to gently say is 'I value our friendship and I don't mind being around your child, but I don't want to always be with you with your child always being there. Your attention (rightfully so) is on the child. It changes everything about the time we spend together.' She probably misses you too.", "YTA. Regarding that specific Saturday night, she invited you along for plans she ALREADY HAD. And you get mad when you see how much fun she had? When you declined her invite? \n\nShe DOES want to hang out with you, just not at your house like you do ALL THE TIME. \n\nShe had been coming over, but maybe she just wants to go OUT instead of staying in the whole time. If you don\u2019t want to be part of that, it\u2019s your choice, but don\u2019t be an ass about it.", "YTA. You need to nurture your friendships. One day your daughter will be grown and gone and you\u2019ll have no friends. Tom can watch his daughter for an afternoon or evening.", "Surprise surprise imagine someone shouting at you and you don\u2019t respond to that tactic. OP you are annoying as fuck and selfish.", "Sounds like you flake on her as much as she flakes on you. YTA", "YTA. You are not putting any effort into this friendship. Can you leave your child with your spouse, or find a babysitter here and there so you can go out with your friend? You should not expect her to always want to go to your house. She may have been better in the beginning when your child could not walk or talk but now she is older and mobile and needs more attention and that may not be your friends thing.", "YTA indeed.  She has made time for you, but you are not trying to accommodate her in the least.  Going out to someplace in totally different from staying in your home.   She has been inclusive, you have been trying to keep her to yourself.", "Yes YTA she did her part and supported you when you had your baby by visiting you. She wants to go out. Not to visit at a friends house the whole time. She keeps on inviting you out so she hasn\u2019t cut you off. Don\u2019t you miss being social and going out? Surely your partner can watch the child when you want to go out? Your entire social life is expecting her to compromise when you are not willing to compromise. Having a baby does not make you special.", "YTA. As much as a friend can love your child, it doesn\u2019t mean they want to see them every time they see you. Sure, some accommodation will happen in the beginning, and it looks like Mia did just that \u2014 by visiting you at home for 18 months!\n\nBut you have made no such accommodation in return. You have just done what is best for you. That\u2019s selfish and asshole-ish. \n\nFrom personal experience, it is unpleasant and draining, as a friend, to have to endure time with new parents when they can\u2019t hold a normal conversation with you that isn\u2019t interrupted every 30 seconds by a simultaneous conversation (sometimes mid-sentence) with a kid that needs their mother\u2019s constant attention. \n\nHer suggesting that you enlist Tom for some occasional babysitting duties is a great idea \u2014 and is in no way \u201cintrusive\u201d or \u201cmeddling in your marriage.\u201d (What an odd takeaway on your part.) \n\nYou should apologize and make time for your friend outside of the house & without your child. I would suggest going child-free one half-day/evening per week.", "YTA. I had a friend like you before. I caught that shit off almost 4 years ago and have never felt better. No one wants to sit at home 24/7 to hang out with you and a kid (even those with kids). Hav me your spouse watch HIS child once in a while so you can also go out. \n\nYou\u2019re going to be asked less and less to go out if you keep saying no, which to me seems likely considering you already lost a few friends and from the sounds of it; it\u2019s this reason alone why you don\u2019t have many friends.", "Huh so I am not gonna assume what took place in the conversation you two last had but, you just start shouting at her in what I hopefully presume was a calm conversation at first? Eitehr way, YTA", "OP not reacting to any of the questions/comments.\n\nThis post smells like on big troll.", "Yeah YTA, stop thinking anyone owes you anything. She invited you out multiple times and you kept saying no, thats on you. She is childless and wants to enjoy her life, to her that means being able to go out and do things rather than being constantly stuck in your home. You just lost a friend because of your selfishness", "YTA. - It seems to me like your \"Best Friend\" is the only one who puts any effort into the relationship. \n\nI get it, you're a mom now but you're the type of mom who expects everyone else to bend to your will because being a mom is more important than all else and god forbid your child be left with dad or a sitter for a couple hours at most. It seems to me that your unwillingness to be away from your child is just going to ruin many adult relationships in your life (or already has based on this post.)   \n\n\nI side with the friend. This would have been my last straw as well. She has done more to keep the relationship going than 99.9% of people would have and for that you still whine and moan because you're \"neglected\" when in fact you are the one being negligent in the relationship.", "YTA\n\nWhy can't your partner watch Ciara so you can get a break away from home?", "YTA. Mia has asked to hang out on numerous occasions and each time she has YOU turned her down and demanded that you do everything at your house. Someone definitely is neglecting the friendship but it sure as heck isn't Mia.", "YTA. Sounds like you just lost a good friend.", "YTA your friend is right.\nJust because you're boring now doesn't mean your friends have to be too. \nShe seems like you're only friend too I'd look into that.", "Mom of 2 LOs here (2 and 4 years old) and i get it. You feel guilty for leaving your daughter alone since you seemingly still are the main caregiver even after she outgrew the baby phase. \n\nThats imo the main issue here. Moms deserve and most of all NEED time to be themselves apart from the child every once in a while. There is no good father in the world who would mind taking care of his little girl once or twice a month for a couple of hours. And you need that time for yourself. For your friendships, for your hobbies, for your mental health. Its vital to be your best self and the best mom you can be. \n\nI struggled too but am now at the point where i take my first 2 day trip with my best friend next weekend and i couldnt be more excited.\n\nThe fact that you accuse her of meddling on your marriage after only asking a question is also very strange. Why didnt you openly talk about Toms role in your daghters life with your best friend? Isnt that currently one of the main topics in your life as a SAHM? Talking about my husband and kids was like 70% of the conversations i had with my friends while i was a SAHM. Its only natural that you want to share and get input. \n\nDefinitely going with YTA and we miss a ton of info here..", "YTA. She\u2019s asked you again and again, repeatedly, to come out and do anything out of your house. You\u2019ve rejected her again and again, instead trying to force her to shoehorn herself into a little slice of time where she can\u2019t be herself and has to come to you. And then you proceed to go off on her and say she\u2019s the one with the problem.", "YTA\n\nShe isn't ditching you. She wants to do something with you other than sitting in your house. You have an 18 month old, not a newborn. Doesn't she go to sleep at 7:30 or 8? Even if your partner isn't very hands-on, surely he can be at home while your daughter sleeps so you can go out. Your friend has been the friend you needed while you are not being the friend she needs. Sounds like her patience is running thin, and you need to act (and apologize) if you want to save this friendship.", "YTA. You didn't have to be rude to your friend. I understand you feel hurt and left out, but it's a fact of life that people with kids and people without kids move in different worlds. Especially when young. We don't have kids and we always joked when we and our friends got to the baby-age that as soon as the kid comes we will never see them again.  And we don't.", "YTA for expecting everyone to cater to you all the time just because you have a kid. You have put zero effort in this relationship and she's realized that and acted accordingly. I doubt there's a chance to salvage this considering you don't see anything wrong with how you've been acting.", "Lol ditched you? She invited you out to plans she already had and you\u2019re mad she didn\u2019t dump her other plans to go sit in your house with you and watch a toddler cry and demand your attention the whole time. YTA and you\u2019re lucky she\u2019s stuck around for so long lol.", "YTA. She hasn't been ditching you. She's invited you out on many occasions. She just doesn't always want to go to your house to see you. She wants to go out and hang out with you. Your partner is perfectly capable of watching your daughter every now and then so you can leave the house. If anything, that would be good for you, too! Mia has been more than accommodating. Her coming over to your house all the time isn't a compromise. If you want to be her friend, you need to give a little too.", "YTA. And you sound incredibly jealous of Mia.", "YTA.  \nShe prefers to have time out with multiple friends friends over hanging out with one friend and a child, most people would, especially CF ones. She's asked you out on a number of occasions and each time YOU were the one doing the 'ditching', you have a partner, you can leave your child with him and go out, YOU choose not to. She's not meddling with your marriage in any shape or form, just pointing out something obvious, if your husband can't or won't look after his own daughter, that's a whole other issue.", "YTA. Did you read your post?\n\nShe invites you to things all the time, and you decline. You want her to come to you all the time, which must get boring. I'm sure she'd be happy to do so some of the time if you actually made and effort to see her. \n\nAnd if your \"best friend\" can't comment on your marriage then who can? Defensive much...\n\nI honestly thought you were a single mum till the last bit.\n\nYou don't mention money as a barrier to going out so could you not hire q babysitter?", "INFO: Is Tom Ciara's father? \n\nIf so, he should be sharing in the parental responsibilities.  You should be able to go out and have child-free time.  If you don't trust him to care for your daughter, you may need to reevaluate why and possibly get counseling.   \n\nYou keep asking your \"friend\" to make all the sacrifices in your relationship, and seem to only want to spend time in ways that are convenient for you.  You also don't seem to understand how important it is for some people who work from home to be able to get out and away from a home environment.  Switching houses to have coffee at doesn't always cut it.  \n\nAs someone who has been both a SAHM and a WFHM, and have friends who also have kids, it is definitely nice to be able to spend time with someone without having to worry about littles underfoot.  Heck, I just hosted a no-kids friends get-together recently because us moms need a break sometimes and it was AMAZING. For the time in question, your friend invited you to partake in her existing plans- you can't get mad at her for not wanting to ditch her other friends to sit on your couch because you felt you couldn't go. And to flip out at her over her having a good time with other friends is major controlling/red flag behavior.  I bet going over for coffee at your house sometimes wouldn't even BE an issue for her if you'd compromise and actually spend some quality time with this person you call a friend.  \n\ntl;dr: YTA.", "One of my friends recently pointed out that we haven\u2019t hung out without my kids in 5 years. Thankfully she is kind, understanding and accepting and although I don\u2019t get time to get together with her much I know she\u2019s always there and I\u2019m sure she knows that I am here for her as well. Relationships change when you have kids wether you want them to or not. My kids love her so much and I really appreciate the relationship she\u2019s built with them. I\u2019m trying to find the time to see her without my kids but haven\u2019t had the opportunity recently with sickness, partners work schedule and the cost of sitters. I know it\u2019s frustrating but you really should try to see it from her point of view and apologize for what you said. She may love your kid but that doesn\u2019t mean she wants to be around the kid every time you get together. Make an effort to have some adult time and go out with her. It would likely be beneficial for both you and your relationship.", "YTA. You changed the dynamic of your friendship once you had a kid to absolutely never go out with her. She has still faithfully invited you out for two years while all your friends have dwindled despite you rejecting her invites every time. By constantly rejecting her invites and insisting she come over you\u2019re telling her that her needs in this friendship don\u2019t matter and she exists for your needs and entertainment only. What do *you* bring to this friendship, besides constant rejection when she\u2019s not at your beck and call to entertain you in your home? Be a friend. Take your baby out with you for coffee with your friend. Let your husband have her for two hours so you can have lunch. Stop treating your friend like you only value her for company when you\u2019re bored at home seeking the presence of another adult but not the actual relationship with one.", "YTA times 2. She has gone out of her way to be accommodating. Friendship goes both ways. She right that hubby could watch the child so you could go out as well. It\u2019s not as fun hanging out in someone\u2019s house all the time.", "YTA  it sounds like your friend has been doing all the accommodating and is tired of it.

That\u2019s not fair. \nYou COULD have left the baby with Tom and gone out with her and had fun. YOU chose not to do that. You had no right to be angry with her. \nAs a woman without kids myself, I can say that I\u2019ve been where she is. And as much as she may love you, you can\u2019t expect her life and priorities to mirror yours. \nAnd getting angry at her for not just rolling over and doing what you want\u2026 that makes YOU a bad friend. \nAlso, why don\u2019t you pop round to hers?

You guys are now living two different lifestyles that are not syncing. It's okay to be jealous and resentful watching your bestie do as she pleases while you stay home BUT you should find someone to talk to about it, to be able to resolve those feelings. \n\nAlso, see it from her perspective.

Either there\u2019s something about your relationship in the way, or you\u2019re one very self centered asshole. I promise, going out with your friend without your child will be good for your mental health, it might save your friendship, and you won\u2019t look up in 12 years to realize you aren\u2019t even a person anymore\u2014you\u2019re just \u201cCiara\u2019s mom.\u201d\n\nApologize to your friend and hope she is willing to forgive you.", "YTA. She hasn\u2019t ditched you at all. She\u2019s tried time and time again to involve you and make plans and all you want to do is spend time in your home. You want her to come over to yours otherwise you don\u2019t spend time together at all. You want it completely your way. Why can\u2019t your partner look after your child while you have a break and a social life? Does your partner go out on the weekends with friends? And you look after the child while he\u2019s out? You are isolating your friends.", "YTA. Your friend is about right that your husband should be able to give you a night out every once in awhile. She also right that it\u2019s unfair of you to always expect her to come to you and hang out on your terms. It\u2019s perfectly okay for someone, childless or not, to prefer to spend their leisure time away from children so that they may act however they wish! You\u2019re being the selfish, unreasonable one. She invited you to go out. It\u2019s not her responsibility to make sure that her plans work for you.", "YTA, I couldn\u2019t even tell you were married until I got to the end of the story. It probably wouldn\u2019t kill your husband to watch over his own child every once in a while.

I am a mom as well and I would NEVER expect my friends to make plans according to my life and obligations. Sure every once in a while going to your house is fine but the childless don\u2019t want to always hang around a child. And that is their right.

My time had no value, my opinion on what to do was inconsequential. It was all about what Mommy wants.\n\nThe last straw was when she got a cat. I am severely allergic.

Very self centered.", "I second this\u2026 why would a child spending time with their father be so triggering? And then it feels like and attack against their marriage? I leave my kids with my husband all the time. I see some potential PPA or PPD that OP may be totally unaware of. Leaving the house with PPA is so difficult at times.", "It baffles me that OP is feeling neglected when her friend seems to be inviting her to hang out fairly often!

I also don\u2019t think the friend saying her partner could watch the kid once in a while so she can leave the house for a few hours was unreasonable at all.

About 18 months ago perhaps?", "A lot of people need to realize that friendships require effort from all parties.

A very gentle YTA (if it hadn't been a fight I'd say N A H). It sounds like OP, your desires have shifted - maybe you'd rather say your money for dates or what have you.

Maybe one a month girls night but weekly coffee at yours, etc.", "Mia has been pretty accommodating though.", "To be fair to Mia, it seems she has!  She went over when OP had just had the child.  She is asking OP to join her when she goes out.

My guess is OP engaged in some behavior policing when Mia came over.

It\u2019s not a crazy assumption to make that this man often doesn\u2019t care for his child without OP very often.", "I think she's jealous that Mia has the freedom to do what she likes, and she no longer does. Which is normal; all parents have a moment of \"what have I done\" every once in a while.

She never goes out because she doesn\u2019t want to. And when with other friend invite her to go for dinner, she says that it would be more fun if we all go to her place. Its easier for her cause that way \u2018she doesn\u2019t have to plan\u2019 anything to accommodate her kid. The one time she went with us, she brought her toddler to a 9pm dinner even when the dad was home willing to take care of her.

She chose to not go. That is not being ditched. The friend had existing plans and invited OP to join in. Instead she suggested that her friend skip the existing outing and again come to her place.

Then I got sick after my last pregnancy, and started asking her to come to me\u2026 she didn\u2019t, in fact, she eventually ghosted me. It was all about me going to her. She eventually regretted it.

You're the terrible friend. \n\nYour defensiveness about your relationship and reluctance to ask your partner for a night off raises some red flags. Is your partner not pulling his weight? Are you ashamed that you might be being mistreated? Your friend, who cares about you, is right to raise this question.", "YTA.

It's not unusual for friendships to end when you have competing/different stages of life as well.", "Yeah seriously sounds like OP hasn't gotten a break in 2 years? Not even to grab a coffee? I get that she's growing resentful, she is taking it out on the wrong person and she gets the YTA vote for that, but if she hasn't gotten a break in that time I can also understand that she's not being rational right now. I would have gone insane", "Sounds like OP could use a couple hours away from the child, just to get out of the house", "YOU ARE MEDDLING IN HER MARRIAGE HOW DARE YOU", "And who *can* say this kind of stuff if not your closest friend? \u201cWhy can\u2019t your husband parent your child?\u201d is a totally in-bounds question for a friendship in my book.", "Yeah OP if youre reading this YTA. I bet the Tom gets plenty of alone time and time out with his friends. You should be able to leave him with the baby so you can as well.", "And Mia has kept inviting OP to stuff for 18 months. She's been a good friend! Kept her in mind, invited her to a range of activities, not given up over that time. And then gets yelled at for it.", "I like how OP reframes this as Mia ditching her, when they hadn\u2019t even made plans \u2014 Mia was actively attempting to INCLUDE her in plans she\u2019d made with other people.\n\nNewsflash, OP. Mia just wants to have a normal social life that occasionally happens outside of your house. It\u2019s not her fault you aren\u2019t willing or able to ever leave it. Sounds like she\u2019s been coming to you for years, while you\u2019ve put zero effort into meeting her halfway.\n\nHave you considered that *you* might be the shitty friend? That what you\u2019re asking of Mia is selfish and unfair? Popping a kid out doesn\u2019t make you the center of the universe.

She asked why it seems like he friend puts in no effort but every time she mentions the friend coming to hang out, or asking to, it's her friend that's trying to make the plans. I don't think she once said she reached out to her friend to make plans. And, as always, just like her friend said, it has to be on OPs terms and at her place. People don't have to be subjected to someone else's kids if they don't want to be. It's no enjoyable to always be around your friends kids and to not be able to spend any actual, uninterrupted time with your friend. \n\nOP is the asshole and she's expecting her friend to apologize to her lol. She doesn't even have a friend anymore. Or any it seems, for that matter.", "Totally agree.  \n\nOP, YTA.  It sounds like your friend has spent a lot of time in your home, and you admit that she is \"brilliant\" with your daughter. Now that your daughter is older, it is not a lot for your friend to expect you to meet her outside of the house once in a while, especially because you have a partner. You are expecting a friendship only on your own terms, and are not considering your friend at all.\n\nThis is coming from someone who is the friend without kids that my friends with kids love.

OP, YTA. \n\nSounds like your friend has been accommodating to you. It's nice she keeps inviting you out, even though you never go. I honesty thought you were a single mom, which would explain why you're never available for a night out. But you're not, so I'm confused why you can never go out?\nIt's fine if you never want to go out but you should be upfront with your friend, as you want her to be with you and stop judging your friend (ex friend now?) for wanting to. Maybe it gets boring sitting around the house. Idk. Shouting at her was definitely not cool. Why are you expecting her to apologize?", "Totally this. \n\nEventually it clicks -- this friendship goes in one direction. I realized this was a lot of my dynamic with my former best friend....when we were kids/ teens, I envied her (wealthy, urban, glamourous, etc)... later when it was more of an even playing field, the dynamic was still a little bit rooted in that and I was like, wait, what am I even getting out of this? I don't really envy anything about you anymore but it seems like you think you're doing everyone a favour by being friends with them. Nice person, but only ever truly close with her mom and her partner.\n\nAnyhow that click was the beginning of the end.

No, thanks.\n\nIn my experience a lot of parents when you ask them how they are, they start to talk about how their kid is and don't say anything about themselves... *If your friends ask about you, they want to hear about you.*", "Ding ding ding, we have a winner.", "Of course. It's just good to remember there are names other than mummy for you. Chat about other interests, even if its just the telly or sports. A few hours off of being mum.", "Right.. like, I have a friend with a pretty sweet kid-free house, and even still I don\u2019t want to only go to theirs for the rest of our friendship. By the 4th time I\u2019d have to be like \u201cnah, I\u2019m actually feeling like going out and doing something fun today\u201d. \n\nAnd my friend would probably say \u201coh true\u201d instead of yelling at me about it.", "And when you're like \"maybe you should talk to them about this\" or \"you do nothing but complain about your partner, maybe it's time to consider other options?\" they get mad at you for trying to offer advice, right?", "Yes, same! I've ended friendships because they suddenly couldn't do anything without towing their new partner along, so I wouldn't hesitate to end one if after almost *2 years* they've never made an effort to meet me outside of their home or without their kid. All adult relationships are reciprocal.", "THANKYOU! This bothered me greatly. You'd think that the idea that \"work from home is still work\" would have shifted during covid when so many people started working from home, but I still see people constantly referring to WFH workers as having \"tons of free time.\"\n\nNo, they're AT WORK. \n\nOP.. YTA, and a shitty friend.", "And when she's done working inside her house, she's expected to just move to another house and never see the outside world unless it's the street between her and OPs house.", "Right! I end up glued to my desk when I WFH because I\u2019m scared to death they will take away the privilege!", "Yeah, if I want to sit around a house with a coffee, I want it to be the one wear I can take my bra off and wear my Jammie\u2019s!", "I\u2019m a parent and yeah if you are out with a toddler there is zero adult conversation happening because you need to either keep them entertained, or stop them from injuring themself.", "This! I absolutely don\u2019t mind when my friends have very little ones going to their place because it\u2019s hard for them to get out, but the whole event is based around the child/children. At some point even if it\u2019s hard you have to make an effort to get out without the kids. If you\u2019re a single parent or your spouse works off hours it\u2019s totally understandable, but if that\u2019s not the case you should be able to go out for a couple hours alone. Don\u2019t throw your friendships away, because one day your kids will be running out the door to friends houses for overnights and hanging out and then what will you do.", "Oh and add to that, many parents want to talk only about their kid, esp. when they're under 2.  So the whole conversation bounces between your example and, the parent rambling on about their kid, and how proud they are of them, and what they're up to with their kid, and all the things their kid loves, and does, and wants, and cries about. \n\nIf you try to have a non kid related conversation it just gets redirected back to talking about the kid.", "YES. The baby talk is insufferable. Plus you can only hear about breastfeeding woes and bowel movements (\u201cSolomon\u2019s potty habits!\u201d) so many times before hanging with that friend becomes a huge, gross bummer.", "Just reading that exhausted me....", "This sounds like it was experienced on a personal level. Are you free from that nightmare?", "Unbear-bearable", "This! I was just thinking \"I bet she just talks about the kid the whole time and how when she says \"kuhqjdbgtmd\" she's saying \"can I have milk wow she's so clever talking already\".\"", "Ugh yeah, so much this...", "And God forbid you use the mildest of mild bad language. I'm thinking damn or bum", "So true.  I told my wife when we have kids we\u2019re not going to do that.  We had our first kid and it\u2019s still\nhard not to talk about mostly them so I tell people if I\u2019m talking about the baby too much just tell me and we can switch topics", "Ahem. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unBear-Bearable.\u201d", "Did they ever find Bear-Bear?!", "I have never read a better description of how it feels when I hang out with my friends who have kids.\n\nIt's exhausting and SO BORING. OP, don't be an a\\*\\*hat to your friend, like she said, it's been two years, it's time for you to accommodate for her.\n\nYTA", "You\u2019re all SO right. I do have a friend who had kids over the last years. As much as I like her, maintaining a friendship is hard. She only stays at her house with the kids and rarely leaves. When I want to meet her, I always have to come to her house in a specific timeframe before her husband comes home from work. And we never get to talk uninterrupted more than 5 mins, as either one of the kids comes to her or she suddenly starts baby-talking to them. When her husband comes home from work, I get pushed to leave. The little bit of attention left for me is completely gone as soon as he enters the door. She even declined my wedding invitation 2 days before the wedding because it obviously was too exhausting to leave the house with them. (The kids were of course invited and we had other kids at the wedding too)\n\nIn the last few years, I only met her outside once, for a coffee in a cafe in town. But it ended up being a coffee to go and a walk in the nearby park with kid in a stroller/walking with us. Turns out she only came out because she needed to get a few groceries in a specific supermarket - which was near that park and cafe. After a round in the park she waved goodbye and was off to that supermarket. Ouch.\n\nI invited her so many times or made suggestions for activities- with and without kids. Asking her how she is on a regular basis. But often no answer or just a very short one. It became exhausting to be her friend. \n\nReading the OPs post really reminded me about this.", "I feel horrible for saying this is my worth nightmare. \nI'm childfree but love all my friends kids. If they need a sitter, I'm down to be the fun aunt who makes sure the kids survive lol. (No babies, my anxiety is too much for them lol)\n\nI also want to have gatherings with just the adults. I also don't do \"baby talk\". However, toddlers seem to really love this as they are \"big kids now and not babies\" as a friends kid told me once lol.", "Unbearable and so boring!  Nothing exists other than the child.", "Hahaha I love this comment bc this is the spelling of my name and it\u2019s so cute to see someone use it as commonly as they would Sarah or Jenny \ud83d\udc96.", "I've never had this issue ,as I know full well going I there this may be the case. \nSo when I'm coming to hang out, I know it's really me hanging out with them and their kid. which isn't an issue since I have no issues with kids ,but I know this isn't for everyone", "I just saw a friend for the first time in 18 months without her kid. And we only went to the pub two blocks from her house. \n\nIt's tiring. I want to stay her friend but it's so limiting. I miss our friendship and the times we spent together. I just don't think our lives are compatible anymore.", "I fell out with a friend for the same reason. The funny thing is we BOTH had kids six weeks apart from each other and I couldn't stand hanging out with her and her kid because she couldn't talk about anything other than him. I started to initiate get togethers where the kids stay home but she hated that idea so we just stopped hanging out at all. \n\n\nI went to a Christmas party a few nights ago where I was the only one bringing my kids (everyone who helps me out when needed was going too). I stopped at the dollar store and got crafts and colouring supplies and things that would keep them busy and they had a great time and I got to socialize with other adults like an adult. It was GLORIOUS. They are also a little older so it's easier (5&3) and are pretty chill in general", "That's basically my family. I have three siblings with 2-3 kids each. Even now when the oldest is 18 it's all they (and my parents) talk about. I can go a whole day of a family gathering saying maybe 30 words because I have nothing to add and, without kids of my own, nothing they want to talk about.", "I have 2 and I jump at the chance to go out without my children, I love them dearly but I do need space away from them - it\u2019s nice to be able to chat about adult life and relax", "Exactly this. Her friend wants friend time, not SAHM time. OP has ditched her friend by making 0 effort to go out sans kid.", "Plus perhaps the friend had turned up. And OP like shhh it\u2019s her sleep time. I don\u2019t want to wake her. Friend tells a story \u201cshhhhh, your being to loud.\u201d", "Why do I have a feeling she\u2019s with someone that feels parenting equates to \u2018babysitting\u2019.", "True, but it could be a starting point for a middle ground. Being at her house all the time is also not fun.", "Or just do the sinful screen time at the cafe so you can chat with your friend.", "Oh I wasn\u2019t defending that. I think it\u2019s creepy af when women throw their whole personality into being a mom/wife.", "YES. I just want to shake them by the shoulders and say HE WAS SHITTY BEFORE YOU HAD THE BABY WHAT MADE YOU THINK HE WOULD CHANGE AFTER YOU BECAME A SAHM AND GAVE HIM FINANCIAL CONTROL!?!?!?", "!!! Went to a friend with a toddler\u2019s house to spend time with them, she ended up distracted the whole time, naturally, because of the baby and house stuff. Which is fine, but the whole time we were trying to have a conversation and kept getting interrupted by the toddler, her husband was sitting in the next room on the couch, scrolling his phone. She made a complaint under her breath about it, but I\u2019ve known this girl for 9 years and I know if I so much and suggested her husband come get their sniveling kid out the kitchen, she would have been furious. He\u2019s \u201cthe best daddy/husband in the world\u201d that I hear complaints about every god damn day. \n\nI wish she would take it as the \u201cyou deserve better than this\u201d that it is, and not as a \u201clet\u2019s shit on your marriage\u201d thing.", ">or stop them from injuring themself.\n\nSwear to god, toddlers have a death wish. \n\nNo, baby, no, don't stick your fingers in there. No, please, don't eat that. No, please, get off there. \n\nHonestly, it's like Jackass on steroids.", "Tbh not just toddlers. As a childless person, even hanging with friends and their older kids, it\u2019s ALWAYS about the kid. Impossible not to feel like an afterthought when a child is around, and who wants to spend their free time that way?", "Second this. I have a 19 month old and feel I barely retain any adult conversation if there is one whilst he\u2019s around. You need eyes in the back of your head.", "You gave birth to a child and decided to become a mother. Your friends are under no obligation to change their wants, needs, or lifestyles to accommodate the choices you make.", "Not to mention how much you end up forgetting and then repeating whatever it was your were trying to say \ud83d\ude05", "My friends and I used to joke that our phone calls sound like a bizarre form of Tourette\u2019s. \u201cSo how has\u2026Timmy, put that down!\u2026work been?

I like kids, but yeah....very little actual interaction between adults when they're around.", "I've done this too, gone to my friends' house when they've just had kids, but it's also great to go out. Also, now I have a 5 month old and I keep asking my friends to go out and have a coffee, but they all wanna come to my place and see the baby. I'm like, dude, let me get my husband to mind my kiddo for 4 hours and let's GO OUT.", "This is so true. I\u2019m the childless friend and it can be exhausting to stay friends with parents that are like this. Sometimes I just want to have a conversation about things that are going on with me/something I can relate to, and not have the entire day filled with nothing but kid talk. I can\u2019t relate to that. If people want to maintain friendships after they become a parent, they need be a good friend and realize that not everything revolves around their life and parenthood.", "It can be boring to go to your house all the time. You expect her to be at your house whenever you want to spend time together.She wants to hang out somewhere else. She can take the kids with her or leave them with her partner so they can have a good time together. You ruined your own friendship. she's not tah, you're ah", "Exactly.  I think we should assume that Bear-Bear was never found, but we may never know the truth.  I\u2019m invested in it now, so this feels like a very loose end.", "Mine is spelled differently but I\u2019m still always surprised when I see a variation of it haha", "This is so relatable. I recently caught up with a friend (finally)... and all she did was talk about her kid. Kept steering the conversation back to her kid, and stopping the conversation every 15 minutes to continually text her babysitter. She just wasn't there with me mentally at all. \n\nAnd when I did mention any of the fun stuff in my life and happy news, you'd think I'd done it all to spite her - she was borderline rude. I genuinely don't think we're compatible anymore...", "I think the difference here is that you're willing to put in the effort to accommodate your child free friends while also raising well mannered children. OP sounds like she resents her friend for not worshiping her child.", "This.  After I finished nursing my child I went on vaca with a dear friend I hadn\u2019t seen in years. No talk of our kids, just two women having a great time away from our families. \nYou need time away from ur kids.  Maybe not a week like I did, but at least a couple of hrs to get adult time.", "Yeah\u2026weird how there\u2019s no mention of partner/coparent until commenting about her friend \u201cmeddling in her marriage\u201d\u2026it sounds like her relationship probably has an impact on her strained friendship, too. Maybe that\u2019s why her friend doesn\u2019t want to go to her house.", "That, or she doesn\u2019t trust her partner/spouse to keep Ciara alive whilst she\u2019s gone because she\u2019s never once left Ciara with someone else.", "Or walk with the kid in the pram!

Im not OP.", "I distanced myself from a lot of my mom friends because they\u2019d ask about my life and then make rude comments about how I needed to grow up and how they now knew *real* fun was watching Disney with their kids and not whatever I was doing.", "I don't get that. I just had a baby and I basically have nothing else to talk about because I'm home all day with my baby and dog so not much going on.

We visited them at their home, the baby was aware and present, around 6 months old to a year (cant remember). It's their first child so we talked about the baby a bit. Then we changed subjects and talked about work, theatre plays we'd been to see, then we went for a walk to soothe the baby for a nap, during which each of us had some time to chat one on one with the friend who wasn't carrying the baby at the time.  They asked questions about what was going on in our lives and sounded genuinely interested! We went away feeling like we had had a genuine connection with new parents. I'm looking forward to seeing them again.", "This is what my bestie & I do. She\u2019s a school teacher so on school breaks we go out during the week to places like the zoo to stroll and chat.
