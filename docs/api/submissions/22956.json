{"id": 22956, "submission_id": "157gazf", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend we\u2019re not getting a Borzoi dog?", "selftext": "I, M34, have been with my girlfriend, F46, for 7 years, she has been asking for a Borzoi breed dog since the start of our relationship. Initially I thought it would be a short lived obsession so I jokingly would say yes we can get one but only when we move in. She seemed very happy with this, fast forward 2 years and we finally moved in together. Once again, the conversation of buying a Borzoi dog game up, I kept deferring it making up excuses such as the flat is too small, we\u2019re too busy and so on. She was mad but she understood so we moved on with our happy lives, Borzoi dog free. \n\nOnce again fast forward another 2 years and we moved into a house, our beautiful dream house, a garden, 2 floors and plenty of space, or as my girlfriend describes it\u2026 \u201cbig enough for a Borzoi dog. We also found new jobs where we can work from home so we would have enough time to look after this hypothetical Borzoi dog. This is where things went downhill in our relationship. She once again brought up buying a Borzoi dog, I was cornered, my excuses no longer applied. I tried prolonging it out by saying not yet, and bless my girlfriend for her patience she kept sighing and leaving the discussion. Then Covid came and one of the very few perks of Covid were that dogs became extremely expensive and that became my new reason not to buy the Borzoi dog. I milked the excuse during covid but now Covid isn\u2019t affecting dog prices\u2026 so her obsession with getting the Borzoi dog has returned.\n\nI should now explain why I don\u2019t want a Borzoi dog. Simply, they\u2019re the most hideously creepy dogs I have ever seen. It\u2019s face makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I cannot imagine having one in the house a running around. It reminds me of the slender man but as a dog. As ridiculous as it may seem, I fear it. My girlfriend thinks the complete opposite. \n\nIt has now become a so much of a obsession she has started buying Borzoi cuddly toys, framed pictures, electronic cases, kitchenware, decoration, ALL Borzoi themed. The Borzoi dog has taken over my house and my girlfriend. We haven\u2019t argued over it yet but my girlfriend genuinely is heartbroken that I won\u2019t get her one. \n\nShe\u2019d cry when binge watching videos of them and it would break my heart so a couple of months ago I finally explained my utter disgust of Borzoi dogs, I explained how the Borzoi dog genuinely disturbs me. She said she that I lied to her all these years promising her the dog, I led her on and that if she didn\u2019t get the dog then she\u2019d consider leaving me. I don\u2019t want to lose her but I can not bring myself to live with a Borzoi dog. \n\nAITA for telling her that we\u2019re not getting a Borzoi dog?", "created_utc": 1690122666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157gazf/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_were_not_getting_a/", "score": 331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of telling her from the beginning that you didn\u2019t want this particular breed of dog you lied to her for *seven years* and continued to move the goal posts while getting her hopes up that one day you would agree to get the dog she wanted.

Of course you\u2019re TA.", "YTA for not being honest with your girlfriend from the begining. \n\"I led her on and that if she didn\u2019t get the dog then she\u2019d consider leaving me\" this is a big red flag!", "YTA. You weren\u2019t joking, you were lying. You thought it would be a \u2018short-lived obsession\u2019 because I don\u2019t know, you treat her like she\u2019s five years old? I would be on your side if you\u2019d been honest up front, but after 7 years of telling your girlfriend yes, we\u2019ll get a Borzoi dog\u2026sorry buddy, you\u2019re either getting none or she should rightly dump you.", "YTA, She has a point. You have lied to her for years or at least not been honest. It seems she has had her heart set on this breed of dog for years and built a future with you to enable having one. You dismissed it as a childish \u201cobsession\u201d and strung her alone hoping it would go away.", "YTA\nShe says you lied to her all these years and she is right. You should have been upfront from the start and say Borzoi is never happening. Now she has invested more than half a decade in you and is probably calling into question not just this, but every promise you have made to her for your collective futures. \nJust get the dog. TBH in so many situations like this where one partner doesn\u2019t want the dog and another does, the dog winds up being besties with the partner that didn\u2019t want it. Open your heart and this pet could benefit you both.", "YTA.\n\ndude, you knowingly dated a person obsessed with those dogs. You're an idiot. She's getting a borzoi dog - that's happening for her.  And how dare you lie to her and make her think you're ok with her dream only to try to steal it away from her?  You should have told her you hated them upfront!\n\nhow dare you make her choose between her lifelong dream and you? and write it off as an \"obsession\"? You don't love her at all, you are selfish.", "She wanted a Borzoi before she wanted you. If you don't want one, that's your problem, because you're getting a Borzoi, lol. YTA", "YTA, you spent seven years purposefully lying to her about this thing that she's obviously really passionate about.  Constantly leading her on and moving the goal posts is incredibly frustrating even if she were to eventually get the thing she wants. But for her to then learn that you never intended to cooperate and just let her believe that you would so she wouldn't leave you is crushing.  It's a deep betrayal of trust and an obvious sign of disrespect.\n\nAnd this is all because you don't like the way the dog looks? Do you want to lose this woman over not wanting to look at a dog with a skinny face? Because that's the choice you're making right now.", "YTA. She is allowed to have dreams and desires for her life. She has waited and completed everything you have demanded before getting a dog. If you don\u2019t want to live with her dog, you\u2019re free to go. You\u2019re not free to stop her from pursuing the things she wants from her life because you\u2019re not interested. Get over your dislike of a hypothetical dog you\u2019ve never met, or leave, but stop trying to tell her what she\u2019s allowed to do. You\u2019ve stolen years of her life promising a future you never intended to have. You\u2019re the worst.\n\nEdit: oh and you don\u2019t have any business telling her \u201cwe\u2019re not getting a borzoi dog.\u201d She is. This is her life. Your lies have cost her enough. For what it\u2019s worth, I had a Newfoundland dog as a kid and I knew I wanted another as an adult. I saved up and bought a house and searched for her for over a year.

But if someone was upfront with me about hating hairless cats, I wouldn't date them because we're not compatible.\n\nYou knew this whole time that she wanted a Borzoi.

It's only a dog. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.  This wasn't some off the cuff wish, it was a goal for the future.  You had agreed.  You not getting one at this point would mean that you don't see her vision of the future as worth consideration as compared to what? That you don't want a funny looking dog?", "YTA. If she wanted the dog, and you didn't, and it was super important to her, then your relationship was not meant to be. But you selfishly manipulated her and lied to her so she would stay with you and not get the dog. You deprived her of her choice for your own benefit. That's not what a loving partner does.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are an AH becaue you agreed, and then did everything to string her along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She said she that I lied to her all these years promising her the dog, I led her on and that if she didn\u2019t get the dog then she\u2019d consider leaving me.\" ..

Wtf dude", "YTA The Borzoi breed is a fabulous breed!  I can tell you you are missing out on having a wonderful and gentle dog. You may not like the way they look, but the minute you spent any time with the dog you would fall in love, I promise you that. Borzois are wonderful dogs and I can understand why your girlfriend is obsessed with them. She has waited for years and she deserves the dog. Think of the joy it would bring her and less about your feelings.", "YTA. Use your words dude.", "YTA for stringing her along instead of communicating to her like a damned adult.", "YTA. She\u2019s right, you did lie to her. It was nonsensical to tell her that the two of you can get one, when you already knew that wasn\u2019t the case. What a waste of her time.", "YTA not because you're gonna tell her no borzoi dog now. YTA because you chose to string her along with the idea she'll get a borzoi dog, again and again you chose to lie to her and gave her hope.", "Why didn't you just explained that you're afraid of borzois instead of making promises for years?

But now it turns out that the answer was always no. For what reason?", "Yes yta. She has made it clear from the very beginning that she wants the damn dog and you just lie and skirt around it. I would leave you too solely because you lied so much instead of just being upfront all this time. \n\nAnd this is a message to the ppl in relationships: don't wait forever.

You should have been upfront from the get go and let her decide whether a relationship with you was worth giving up something she deeply wanted.", "YTA.

At least the dog won\u2019t lie to her and waste so much of her life.

For some reason you dismissed her desire and interest for this breed as childish and something she'd change her mind over. Why did you do that? Do you think men's interests will change or is it just women you think don't know their own mind? I suspect your views of women are misogynistic which compounded with your lies makes me think your relationship could be in big trouble.\n\nShe now will look back on your whole relationship differently, knowing that you weren't honest.

Learn about the breed.  Borzois are a member of the sighthound family that includes greyhounds, Afghan hounds, Spanish galgos, Salukis, and Italian greyhounds.  They are a very interesting breed.

It is not going to work out long-term bc one person will never be truly happy - either bc they got baby trapped (can also be the woman when guilted into having a kid by the husband) or the other will never be happy bc they have to stay CF. \n\nI see those options for you with solutions:\n\nShe wants that specific breed and you don't - break up, before you waste each other's time any longer\n\nYou can both agree on a different breed - this might work out and you have a future\n\nShe wants any dog and you none - break up now, before you waste each other's time any longer\n\n!

Initially I thought it would be a short lived obsession so I jokingly would say yes we can get one but only when we move in. She seemed very happy with this, fast forward 2 years and we finally moved in together. Once again, the conversation of buying a Borzoi dog game up, I kept deferring it making up excuses such as the flat is too small, we\u2019re too busy and so on. She was mad but she understood so we moved on with our happy lives, Borzoi dog free. \n\nOnce again fast forward another 2 years and we moved into a house, our beautiful dream house, a garden, 2 floors and plenty of space, or as my girlfriend describes it\u2026 \u201cbig enough for a Borzoi dog. We also found new jobs where we can work from home so we would have enough time to look after this hypothetical Borzoi dog. This is where things went downhill in our relationship. She once again brought up buying a Borzoi dog, I was cornered, my excuses no longer applied. I tried prolonging it out by saying not yet, and bless my girlfriend for her patience she kept sighing and leaving the discussion. Then Covid came and one of the very few perks of Covid were that dogs became extremely expensive and that became my new reason not to buy the Borzoi dog. I milked the excuse during covid but now Covid isn\u2019t affecting dog prices\u2026 so her obsession with getting the Borzoi dog has returned.\n\nI should now explain why I don\u2019t want a Borzoi dog. Simply, they\u2019re the most hideously creepy dogs I have ever seen. It\u2019s face makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I cannot imagine having one in the house a running around. It reminds me of the slender man but as a dog. As ridiculous as it may seem, I fear it. My girlfriend thinks the complete opposite. \n\nIt has now become a so much of a obsession she has started buying Borzoi cuddly toys, framed pictures, electronic cases, kitchenware, decoration, ALL Borzoi themed. The Borzoi dog has taken over my house and my girlfriend. We haven\u2019t argued over it yet but my girlfriend genuinely is heartbroken that I won\u2019t get her one. \n\nShe\u2019d cry when binge watching videos of them and it would break my heart so a couple of months ago I finally explained my utter disgust of Borzoi dogs, I explained how the Borzoi dog genuinely disturbs me. She said she that I lied to her all these years promising her the dog, I led her on and that if she didn\u2019t get the dog then she\u2019d consider leaving me. I don\u2019t want to lose her but I can not bring myself to live with a Borzoi dog. \n\nAITA for telling her that we\u2019re not getting a Borzoi dog?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Since you imply that you've never even been around borzoi dogs, why don't you at least meet one?? Do research and look up their traits.
