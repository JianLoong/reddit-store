My grandfather John is a textbook narcissist. He emotionally abused his kids and made all of their accomplishments about himself. John claims that the reason 4 out of his 5 kids are no-contact with him is because they were \u201cmanipulated\u201d by Grandma after the divorce.\n\nJohn is a bigot as well. John has disowned several relatives for dating/marrying non-white people. My sister Emma dated a Hispanic guy for a few months. It didn\u2019t work out and they moved on. John found out and started telling people how he was going to cut Emma off until Emma \u201cstarted using some common sense\u201d and \u201cgot back on the right path\u201d when the breakup literally had nothing to do with John\u2019s racism.\n\nMy mom only visited John once a year for Christmas. She only communicates with him so we can get his money since John\u2019s very well-off and we don\u2019t want his bigoted church to get the money. (This church believes in verbally abusing and humiliating queer kids in order to \u201ccure\u201d them.) My mom and I have been visiting John more recently because he\u2019s in the final stages of a terminal illness. His doctor told us that John has a few weeks at best.\n\nEmma has been talking to me a lot about how she wants to introduce John to her fiance David (David\u2019s half-Korean) and that I should come out to John at the same time. I told Emma that I didn\u2019t want to come out to John and that if she wanted I would share the money with her after John died. Emma told me that I should stand up to John and I was being a coward for not standing by her.\n\nI explained to Emma that I\u2019m just trying to be logical. It would feel great to come out and stick it to John. But the fact is that John\u2019s going to die very soon anyway. So all that would really accomplish is getting money sent to bigots. If I just don\u2019t say anything for a month then that will make sure the money doesn\u2019t go to bigots and we can put it towards something good.\n\nSome other relatives told me that it\u2019s my choice to not come out to John. But that the right thing would be to stand by Emma and come out to him. And that standing up against bigots is always more important than money. I still think it would do more good in the long run for me to just not say anything for a month and keep the money away from John\u2019s bigoted church. But AITA?\n\nEdit: We don't care about keeping any of John's money.

That\u2019s a terrible thing for them to push you to do", "NTA it's not Emmas choice who you come out to, money or not. Also, why does Emma want to instigate racism against her fiance? If he is truly on deaths doorstep, why not just avoid the situation all together?", "NTA at all. There\u2019s no logical reason for you to come out to him. It\u2019ll only harm you financially, and also probably emotionally.

He thinks of you as subhuman and this experience is likely distressing for you, but it\u2019s helping me prove a point!\u201d Her point is more than valid, but subjecting marginalized people to bigots isn\u2019t the way to do it (unless her partner autonomously volunteered to be a part of sticking it to John by coming to meet him). Same applies to why it\u2019s not okay for her to be pressuring you to come out.

You owe him nothing, and I can\u2019t think of a single reason you WOULD come out to him. Besides all that, the biggest \u201cfuck you\u201d is his money going to his \u201csecret\u201d gay grandchild.

No one else\u2019s. \n\nI will also add that if you sister wants to take a stand with her \u201cnon white\u201d boyfriend that\u2019s her choice, but it\u2019s a poor one if it will also end up with her portion of the estate going to the church. \n\nAbsolutely stand up for what\u2019s right, but in this case it will not change his viewpoint and more harm that good will ultimately be caused.", "NTA.

It is not like you have to hide for very long if he is going to be gone very soon. Assuming you are sure that his money is definitely coming to you/your family and would go to the bigoted church if he found out, then it would be more harmful to you and the community in general for you to come out to him.", "NTA, it is your right to come out when, how and where you choose and nobody else's.

You guys are kissing the bigot's ass for the money, just own up to it.", "NTA\n\nI understand your sister but thinking logically there's nothing to gain from that stand. That stand is changing nothing, he's dying a bigot, take that money and have a good one.", "NTA. Refusing to let money fall into the hands of church bigots *is* standing up against bigots, & a lot more effectively than coming out just to piss off one bigoted old man. It appears the subtlety of that is beyond the family members nagging you, though.", "NTA\nIsn\u2019t keeping the money out of the hands of the bigoted church the real win?\nWhy does Emma want to expose her fianc\u00e9 to your grandfathers racism? She\u2019s not going to change the way he feels so what exactly is the purpose of the visit. \nDo what you want- this is one of those issues where everyone has got to make their own choices", "NTA, but there's no way you can know for sure where that money is going. You may be sucking up to him for nothing.", "NAH. You know what would be fun? Telling him after he's no longer considered of sound enough mind to edit the will. Look into where your state draws that line.", "Not gonna vote but all that money is probably gonna go to the church and all the squabbles will be for nothing", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's fair that gay people are always expected to take the higher road in the face of homophobia. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely times where it matters a lot and is important. But homophobia itself isn't fair, so why should you have to play fair? I think using a bigot's money however you want is a pretty great f you. Considering the money is going to go to an anti-gay church if it doesn't go to you, then coming out would hurt the larger gay community more than you keeping quiet in this instance.", "NTA because it's the OP's decision alone to decide when or if to come out to J. \n\nThe OP can't pretend though that their reasoning is something noble like preventing a bigoted church from getting money. It's about the OP wanting a slice of the pie.", "This is probably not the popular answer but ESH. As a homosexual myself, nobody should tell you who to come out to and when, that is something you decide when you are comfortable sharing that. Your sister should not be pressuring you to come out to anyone, and I agree with you that there\u2019s hardly any point in coming out to John in particular. \n\nBut I\u2019m gonna be real with you, you and your family really suck for kissing up to someone you don\u2019t respect(not saying you should) for the sole purpose of getting someone\u2019s money. That is incredibly manipulative, greedy, and John\u2019s bigotry does not excuse you, none of you are entitled to that money and kissing up to and withholding information that might change where the money goes to is incredibly wrong. I can\u2019t say I approve of that money going to a bigoted church as an alternative though\u2026..\n\nSpeaking of, unless one of you is deeply involved in the making of his will how do you even know for certainty that you\u2019ll inherit said money anyway?", "ESH - this one again.

Just do what works for you.  There's a fine line between 'brave' and 'stupid' but what Emma's suggesting is way over on the 'stupid' side.  What actual good will sticking it to John do at this stage? \n\nIt gets on my nerves when people prioritize moral crusades over, you know, actually making shit work.", "ESH. Money > your values.", "ESH\n\nLying to someone, to manipulate them into giving you money, even if they are a bigot or racist, is bad and wrong.

It\u2019s yours to tell who want and when you want.  Although I won\u2019t lie I would love for the last thing he hears before he dies is you coming out when it\u2019s to late to change his will.", "NTA. What do either of you stand to gain from sticking it to Jon? \n\nShort term satisfaction and nothing else.", "NTA\n\nTLDR - Do what you need to do for your own reasons. Morals are important, but standing by your sister in this case may not be the best idea. \n\nLike others have said, it's on you and you alone if you come out. (BTW not coming out to John and letting him think you're straight is NOT the same a sucking up or putting money above morals! He has no need to know if you don't want him to know and no one has the right to pressure you, regardless of the reason.)   And the fact is, he's not going to be around much longer, so while it'll probably piss him off if you come out, that's short term. But your inheritence could really help you for a long time if you manage it right. Besides, what better way to stick it to him (if that's what you want.)\n\nEmma can do what she wants, but it seems to me she's trying to cut off her nose to spite her face. Introducing her boyfriend to her bigoted grandfather as a moral stand at this time is pointless to me. John's anger is too short term, especially in comparison to the rest of her life.  Too many people want to shove differences in other people's faces as a big f.u., usually just for the shock value. But this is so short term that it only hurts her, and potentially you if you stand by her.  He's not going to care when he's dead, that's for sure. Regardless, she shouldn't expect you you see things the way she does.  Plus she may just be goading you to come out because she doesn't want to face him alone. \n\nAdditionally, I personally think that keeping the money out of the hands of the bigoted church is good. People are saying that it wouldn't change the church if they don't get the money, which is true. But the church getting it will give them so much more ammunition (potentially literally) to go after people they don't like. In other words, I think you'd be causing more damage letting the church get the money. \n\nFinally, I think anyone saying anything to the effect that you're kissing ass or putting money ahead of morals is thinking about it the wrong way. You and your family have been dealing with his bs for your whole lives, so in my opinion you do deserve that money. Think of it as an asshole tax if nothing else. And it seems like your family is owed lots of back taxes. You could even share it with the parts of the family that he cut off like you volunteered to do with Emma. While that won't do anything to him when he's gone, it'll sure help the people in your family who had to deal with him while he was here.", "NTA- take the money hunny. There's no reason everybody gotta stay poor.", "NTA, and there's really no point in riling John up on his deathbed, which is what it sounds like your sister is trying to do.  Just maintain whatever peace there still is in the family, especially if you do not feel the desire to come out.  If coming out would provide you with some sort of empowerment, then go for it.  But it sounds like you don't feel comfortable with that, and also, he's not going to change.", "NTA / you shouldn\u2019t have to come out to anyone. even if they would be supportive, you do not have to come out.", "Listen, no one, NO ONE gets to tell you when it's time to come out.

Use it to better your position, and even better, your sister could use it to literally improve her life with her \u201cnon white\u201d SO and the life of any future kids.
