She got upset by my request and said that she loves me but that she's sorry cuz she's not giving up on eating it and that lowering the amount of times she does was already enough.\n\nHer family eats seafood often and she grew up eating a lot of it so I kinda get why it would be hard for her to give up on it but I think that if she cared enough she'd be willing to do it. \nSo AITA.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No joke it was one of the most confusing and terrifying things that has ever happened to me. I couldn\u2019t stop vomiting on him and the surrounding furniture and I felt deadly sick. It took hours to figure out what had happened. Finally after googling a bunch of things I asked him if he happened to have eaten mollusk recently.. He had three oysters for dinner the night before. He no longer eats anything I\u2019m allergic to. Not because I made him but because he cares more about me and our sex life than mollusk.
