We've been dating for 2 years now and recently we discussed moving-in together into his house. Prior to this, we had always had separate living situations and, while living alone he had a butler and cleaners to help him manage his home. Now, while he is wealthy (he's from a very wealthy family, has inherited wealth from said family and he is in residency for cardiology), I simply did not think this was a good use of money but I didn't say anything.\n\nWhile discussing that we wanted to to move-in together however, I told him that I was uncomfortable with the fact that he had hired help around the house to clean and cook for him and specifically that it was an improper use of his money. He got mad and told me that it was his money and that if I wasn't comfortable with it then I should cook and clean as he had no desire to. I told him it would be better if we split the responsibility, to which he outright said no and, eventually, the argument transpired to me calling him a child.\n\nTo this he got pissed off. Eventually, we went to bed and the next morning he sat down with me and said that it may be advisable to maintain our separate living arrangements. After some discussion, I convinced him otherwise that we should still move-in together.\n\nNow, I really love my boyfriend and I want our relationship to continue to grow. I want to move-in with him and eventually start a family with him but I am really uncomfortable with the fact that he has no desire to actually work in the house. That said, it is his money and maybe I overreached by discussing how he should spend his money.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for calling my boyfriend a child?\n\nEdit: To everyone saying I am the asshole. I think you guys might be right. That said, it's just that I feel these are basic adulting skills that everyone should have and it just makes me uncomfortable that he has made no effort to ever even learn some basic things in the kitchen or how to do his laundry.", "created_utc": 1672991884, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104ogci/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriend_a_child_for_not/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA. If the housework is done, he\u2019s not expecting you to do it, and he can afford to pay to have it done, loud cheers. Cleaning isn\u2019t a virtue, it\u2019s a necessity. The problem comes when he thinks it\u2019s beneath him, but not you.", "YTA and I can\u2019t believe all these people are saying otherwise. It\u2019s extremely judgemental of you to \u201cdecide\u201d a cleaner is a bad use of his money and call him a child. He\u2019d be well within his rights to argue that cleaning is a bad use of his time, and that you\u2019re instead just a bit of a loser with nothing better to do. I don\u2019t actually know any doctors that want to spend their limited, valuable, free time mopping the floor.", "YTA. His money his decisions on how to spend it. As a doctor, your boyfriend isn\u2019t going to spend his limited free time cleaning and cooking. Anyone who has grown up with household help and can afford to pay for isn\u2019t going to suddenly start sweeping and banging pots and pans.", "YTA\n\nI think many of us wouldn't clean if we could afford to have it done for us, and that doesn't make us children. We could get into the ethics of wealth here, but you are either already ok with his money or you shouldn't be with him.", "YTA.  If he can afford a maid, good for him.  Who wouldn't want that off their plate, especially whilst doing their residency?  Sounds like you are wealth-shaming him a bit, which you are going to have to get over if you want this relationship to work.  Furthermore,  it's really not your place to tell him how he should or shouldn't spend his money.", "Yta. He was quite upfront about his lifestyle. He has no desire to take care of any housework or cooking. He had someone already established to do it for him. You've admittedly convinced him otherwise. But he's the child? Idk about anyone else but why try to convince him if he's adamant about it? If that's the way he grew up that's a core trait now. Might as well change his personality too", "YTA for calling him a child\n\nDoing your own cooking and cleaning isn't a moral issue. Neither of you is a better or worse person than the other. Employing people to do those tasks creates employment, shares his wealth a bit, and allows him to concentrate on other things he finds more fulfilling.\n\nIt might be worth thinking about why you feel this way about it.", "YTA.  You have no right to tell him how to spend his money.  He is absolutely correct, he can pay for the cleaning or you can do all the cleaning, or he can pay for someone to do his half.\n\nYou\u2019re problem is that you want to force him to physically do the cleaning.  What if he said that he doesn\u2019t believe in buying pre-packed food and every time you eat, you have to cook from scratch, make the bread, pasta, sauces, etc.  \n\nEveryone has things that they pay for because of convenience, if you can afford it, then a partner shouldn\u2019t stand in your way", "YTA. He\u2019s a resident. If it\u2019s like when my husband was a resident, all he did was sleep and work. He told you upfront he would rather pay for these services than do them himself. In his line of work, he likely won\u2019t be able to contribute equally at home. \n\nIt\u2019ll always be like that if you\u2019re with a doctor, so if you can\u2019t handle it jump ship now. You\u2019ll likely be the primary parent if you have children with this man. If you continue to refuse outsourcing chores/cooking, the same with that-primarily on you. I advise you learn to accept outside help or leave him.", "YTA. I think what most people are missing today is free time besides work to do the things they enjoy. If he has the chance not to why should he spend time doing work he does not Want to do besides his job? If you really want to start a family at a later time, would you not have him spent time with children rather than clean the toilet?", "YTA why does he have to learn to do things when he can pay to have it done? I prefer seeing a wealthy person actually take advantage of their wealth instead of putting on this humble facade. He\u2019s also helping someone by giving them a job.", "YTA\n\nIt's his money and his house? You don't get to come live somewhere and criticize how they run their househld and if you have an issue with it, do it yourself. \n\nBasic Adulting skills or not, he has money to make sure his house stays clean when he doesn't want to do it. We have a cleaner too at my household, doesn't mean we don't know how to clean, just means we dont always have time.", "Yta. Responsibilities for running a house should be evenly split. But if he wants to outsource his portion then that is on him.", "YTA. It is his money and he can hire whoever he wants. Honestly, if you want to eventually start a family with him having these helpers around will be great for you after you have children. You will be able to spend more time with your family. I think for those of us that didn\u2019t grow up with this kind of lifestyle it can feel weird to spend money on these things, but you get used to it over time. You can still cook or clean things if you want as well. You can tell them to not do things for you.", "YTA\n\nHe can do whatever he wants with his money and it is not up to you to decide if that was a proper use for his money or not and what kind of skills every person have to be able to do. Do you now decide what people can spend their money on? Whats will come next? You tell him when he can get new clothes?\n\nI am also not sure you should move in just now. You needed to convince him. This can backfire as he will now do it while feeling he shouldnt. Dont you want him to be excited to move together?\n\nYou two should discuss first how you want to split the tasks when living together.", "Yta. If he has the money to spend on this then what's the problem? He is giving someone else the chance to work and is giving himself free time.  There is nothing wrong with having hired help. I used to have a cleaner come in on Saturdays when I was financially better off now I have side jobs cleaning other people's houses to make ends meet.", "YTA  \n\n\nHe has the money and he is not married to you yet.  \nIf you are married to him, and he is using the money from the common income to pay the cleaner, You have the right to question him.  \n\n\nBut he is from a wealthy family and has a lot of inherited wealth.  \nHe never had worked on those cleaning task around the home (Not healthy but it is his lifestyle). \n\nHe may have the mindset that instead of wasting time on cleaning, I can earn more money during that time and that compared between the money I earned and the money I spent on the cleaner, I can get a profit, so why should I do the cleaning.", "YTA I always worked toward earning enough money to not have to clean my own house.", "YTA and a big one\n\nIf he has the money to give work away?\nWhy not?!?\nThis is how businesses are working.\nYou want to teach him, how you think simple life should be for him.\nYour style of life is not a law for everyone.\nHe das the money and possibility and the wish to pay for it. I would do it too \ud83d\ude01", "Eh, I wouldn't worry about it. If I could afford to pay someone to do my housework I would. If/when he's broke, he'll learn. Until such time, why shouldn't he hire someone to do what he doesn't want to? I mean, I should probably cook more, but I do order delivery sometimes because I can afford to.", "YTA \n\nBf laid the boundary of not wanting to do household chores. He has the means to hire help. It\u2019s his money. \n\nYou dictating what he can spend his money on because it is \u201cwasteful\u201d isn\u2019t cool. You have no jurisdiction on that.\n\nYou being disappointed that he doesn\u2019t want to attempt to learn how to do household chores and \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with not knowing basic skills is strictly an opinion. He has the privilege to forgo this \u201cbasic skill\u201d and has chosen to embrace that privilege fully. Power to him. \n\nYou\u2019re not his mom, you don\u2019t need to force him to learn things.

Enjoy that.", "YTA he offered you to stay separate but you still pushed to move now you have no right to complain", "YTA. While you are right that cooking, cleaning and laundry are useful life skills that everyone should be taught, he has the means to get it done for him by professionals and he is not requiring you to do it. Consider yourself lucky instead.", "YTA You are upset at a blessing. Less chores means more time together and less time wasted on stuff nobody wants to waste valuable time on. He has the money, he can hire a cleaner. \n\nIf you can't stand it then you aren't ready to move in with him. You don't even live with him and yet you are trying to lord over his money.", "YTA. If he has the money to hire a cleaner why shouldnt he. Hes in residency doctors work long hours. So having more free time because he doesnt have to clean sounds pretty good.", "I\u2019ve read your edit. Yes it is basic adulting duties but realistically, I don\u2019t know anyone who would not rather just have someone else do it. If I could afford to, I probably would too.\n\nHowever, if you have such very different beliefs over this, you may not be compatible as a couple\u2026..", "YTA for calling him a child, but not for your opinion. So, If he wants to outsource housework and can afford to do so, that\u2019s his prerogative. Similarly, if it\u2019s important for you that you (and your partner) perform all of the chores rather than hire a cleaning service etc, that\u2019s yours. The idea here is to respectfully find common ground or a compromise.

And maybe I would also not want to spend money that way. But this is such a fundamental difference in values that I would end the relationship. I wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who expected me to do all the domestic work. The only resolution that could work is for you to agree to hire people because your bf will NEVER do his share of the domestic work himself.

I agree household chores should be shared, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to tell the cleaners and butler to only clean his messes and only cook for him. Your portion will also be taken care of. You will have lots of extra time for you to enjoy doing other things. \n\nI grew up poor and am technically still poor, so I know how it can feel weird spending money that way or like it\u2019s a \u201cwaste\u201d because you can do it yourself. But as a single mom, I would absolutely love if someone could do all that stuff for me just once a week because it would free up so much of my time, which I could use to do more things with my child and more time on my hobbies. You can still do some cleaning and whatever if you feel obligated, but I think you should give it a try and I\u2019d bet that it wouldn\u2019t take long before you\u2019re on board with the cleaners and butler.", "YTA.

If he can afford to pay for cleaning then why not? From your perspective, cleaning's no big deal so why waste money on it? Neither of you are wrong, you just attach different values to cleaning yourself and paying for someone else to clean.\n\nLooking longer term, can you foresee this being a flashpoint if children come into the picture?", "NAH Neither of you is wrong. You clearly come from different worlds, with different values and expectations. You see merit in looking after a home yourself, he sees it as a chore that he can pay others to accomplish. There may be a deeper problem that this has highlighted though. Are there deeper values that you hold that your BF does not, and vice versa, and could these lead to issues in your relationship that become irreconcilable?", "Somehow a little bit of everything. I think somewhat YTA for calling him a child and also a bit for telling him how to spend (or not spend) his money, NTA for expecting a certain level of independence in household situations and NAH for different ways of living. I can totally understand where you're coming from. Not knowing any household skills is for me giving off some child vibes aka your loooking for a new mom to clean after you. However, your bf obviously comes from a different background and seemingly where you don't need to do chores yourself. Thus calling him a child over this probably doesn't relate to him. That being said, you must probably understand that he sees no value in learning this and coming from money he will most likely always be able to pay someone. Are you ok with this? Can you compromise with this? What you write is like This is a basic skill and it has be known. But you're not fundamentally right with this and I guess if you want this to work you have to consider your boyfriend's perspective", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Either you or paid staff will do the chores accept it.", "\"Cleaning isn\u2019t a virtue, it\u2019s a necessity\"\n\nThis sentence is so good, I'm going to steal it \ud83d\ude0e", "Exactly this. OP, do you equate doing your own cleaning to some moral high ground? \n\nYou\u2019re actually the one who sounds like a child by insisting on something that has no logical basis or negative impact on your life. \n\nI hope you realize by his immediate reaction that someone like him is not going to start giving you justifications for how he spends his own money, because you\u2019re simply used to another way of life. \n\nYTA", "And if he can afford to pay for help shouldn't he be using his money to support someone else instead of on whatever OP thinks is a morally superior use?\n\nYTA.", "I don\u2019t personally know any doctors at all but what person wants to spend their free time cleaning\u2026 anyone I know who could afford to hire out for those services would. Being able to spend more time with your kids or having a hobby you could dedicate time to, nah I\u2019d rather scrub this shitty toilet. OP YTA, even if he didn\u2019t have a demanding job he can do with his money as he pleases. Knowing adult skills and choosing to do them just for the fun of it when you don\u2019t have to are totally different things anyway.", "I'm a math teacher.", "Even if they were married, she doesn't get to dictate how he spends his money.", "Why does it give you the ick?  I think it's a basic skill to know how to change a tire, but I don't lie awake at night fretting about people who don't know how.", "But why should he clean and cook, when he can pay others to do it? He can earn many hours of cleaning by working one hour as a doctor. I agree that he should _be able to_ clean, cook and do laundry, but that is not the same as saying he should do it.", "Learning that housework is morally neutral helped me untangle a lot of knots.", "Hmm. When I proposed someone doing our laundry, my wife declined. She doesn\u2019t want other people touch her stuff.\nSame with cleaning the apartment.\n\nGiven her concerns, having a stranger in our home would definitely have a negative impact, although self inflicted.\n\nThough we share the burden, and she would never expect me to do stuff if I mentally/physically can\u2019t, and do her share to the same extend.\n\nOnly downside is: some stuff sometimes has to be done. So one of us has to overexert themselves at times, while the other feels bad he/she couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nWell, I sidetracked a bit.\n\nNot saying you are wrong. I just think it depends. Also if kids grow up having someone else do all the chores, will they also grow up like him, not being able to cook or do their laundry?\nI still see some discussions needed before family planning should proceed? \ud83d\ude02", "What if, he loses all his money? It happens. ESH OP, but I think you should talk to him about why you are uncomfortable with him not being able to take care of himself. If you two have children and he somehow loses his money they will be parentified (most likely) bc he has never learned (seemingly) the basics of adulting. You don't have a right to tell him how to use his money, but him making an effort to at least learn basic things seems like it would go a long way for you.", "If i recall, the bf is in residency and those are notorious for 80+ hours of work a week. I would say he's well within his rights to say no due to his time being limited and no one wants to come home from 16-24 hour shifts to clean because their girlfriend refused to let them pay for a cleaner", "I think you might be scared that he becomes less involved in the daily routine than you and that somehow you have to deal with it. He as the payer, you might also disagree on some of the directives although directly impacted by these choices. In case of children, I doubt you would want a stay at home nanny so basically, maybe you could consider it a sign of his future involvement as a father. Seems strange to me to be willing to control this kind of expenses because in the overall being relieved from daily chores gives you time for so many other stuff. This being said, it could be basically that you have much more upcoming decisions that involve money that you feel you are not on the same page with him. Like the tree hiding the forest.", "How much free time do you have? How much free time does he have? How much of this is spent together? Would you rather spent it together doing something nice, meaningful or you\u2019d rather do chores? What happens if and when you have kids? How much does it affect his budget? There are many things to take in consideration.", "I'm generally against hiring others for domestic labour but understand that people who grow up in that situation may never question it.", "In your case, my compromise to my spouse would have been that we do own laundry and get help with deep cleaning while we\u2019re home. That way it\u2019s still help in a way that makes her less uncomfortable. It\u2019s great that you compromised and you both share the burden without issues. \n\nA lot of this depends on how demanding your career is, how much free time you have and the finances etc. I can\u2019t imagine a doctor with a stressful job who grew up with that much wealth would be willing to do half the chores simply because his spouse feels uncomfortable by having help. If it\u2019s such a deal breaker for her, it would only show him incompatibility.  That\u2019s probably why he suggested keeping the current living arrangements.\n\nI agree there needs to be discussions. You can also still have help around the house and teach your kids responsibility and independence \ud83d\ude0a", "What if he loses his money? Well then he can start cleaning up himself. It's not rocket science and since he's a resident, he probably isn't the dumbest person out there. It's not like he needs a college degree for that lol", "Right? I might have some concerns if my bf was super wealthy and didn't work and didn't do anything around the house (not because he was paying for cleaning, but I'd be concerned about a lifestyle with 0 effort). But residency is HARD. If he's fortunate enough to be able to afford someone to do his household stuff for him, good for him. I'd advise him to not brag about it at the hospital as most residents can't, but I think he made an incredibly logical choice.", "He's in residency so i doubt he has a ton of free time and she's basically asking him to give up that little time and clean and cook", "As long as they are paid a fair wage and treated with respect I see no problem", "People need jobs and this is a job. Some people do genuinely love cleaning. You can be free to not pay for it, but he is already overworked with being in residency for cardiology so therefore she's going to burn him tf out by asking him to contribute equally.", "I share your viewpoint.\n\nI was even close to judge them just being incompatible \ud83d\ude39, but that would have went too far for long range diagnosis \ud83d\ude05", "Could literally check YouTube and learn in less than a day. \n\nWho the hell wants to do housework, and especially when he's a resident cardiologist? He's already working coked out hours.", "Lol literally was going to say it\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s laundry, I\u2019m sure he can figure it out.", "I know. I\u2019m a resident myself. I was trying to make OP understand what is she asking and consider some things.", "You're entitled to that opinion, mine is different."]}
