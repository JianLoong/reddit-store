Both the grocery store and the gas station is right beside his work. \n\nBasically what it boils down to is that every single time he's asked me if I need anything from the store (anything- food, drinks, snacks, stuff for dinner, etc) and I say yes, he will come home after work without it and then say \"did you really need me to pick that up\" or \"do you really need that?\" Or \"so you want me to go to the store for you or..?\" Sometimes he does actually forget and he gets a pass those times but usually there's no excuse.

He grabbed the broccoli, didn't get the sprite.

Not getting the woman whose body gestates  and recently birthed his child food is horrible\n\nPlease reconsider having another child with a man who can't care properly for what you need at this time", "NTA. Uno reverse the next time he asks that question and say \u201cyes.\u201d Have him go to the store and grab that sprite.", "NTA my husband define owning a task as communication planning and execution. The idea is if one of us accepts a task it\u2019s our job to plan for it, execute it and communicate about it. If we run into an issue, we solve it. \n\nThis means historically when it was my husbands turn to make dinner and he forgot to thaw the meat he needs the night before he\u2019d come to me and say oops I forgot, what do I do now? This put the mental load and stress of coming up with a last minute dinner while juggling a baby on me.\n\nNOW that we have clearly defined these things he takes ownership, he\u2019s invested. Instead he says hey I forgot to thaw the meat I\u2019m really sorry about that so I was thinking instead I\u2019ll make butternut squash pasta. It\u2019s not about getting it right, it\u2019s that he solved his own problem and didn\u2019t make it mine. \n\nYour husband is clearly not owning these tasks and instead looks at it like he\u2019s doing you a favor. He needs to step it up and do better. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s not like he just made a mistake and forgot one time. He consistently chooses not to do things for you, knowing you don\u2019t have access to a car and are entirely reliant on him (and also are keeping his child alive and recovering from creating that child). It sounds like you two need to have a serious conversation about what you need from him.", "He forgot. Then conveniently asked if you wanted what he supposedly forgot? Interesting. \n\nAdding stress to the delicate current nature of your hormones trying to balance themselves again after pushing out a whole human is\u2026..more than shameful.", "NTA, he's being manipulative and deserves to feel like shit for it", "NTA", "That's not a healthy way to communicate. He's in the wrong for being absent minded and nonchalant, and you need to talk to him about showing respect and consideration. Yelling and swearing at him is not the way to speak to him. Neither of you should do that. Sit him down, turn off the TV, and talk to him about your feelings and expectations.", "NTA feel like might be something else but that is the outlets he's choosing. Sounds like it's a passive aggressive thing. At least if he avoids conflict, probably is. Could just be he's burnt out and worried about money too idk. Us guys do try to simplify shit too much or over complicate it and overthink. I'm not sure which one he is", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
