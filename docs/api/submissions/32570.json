He's in the wrong for being absent minded and nonchalant, and you need to talk to him about showing respect and consideration. Yelling and swearing at him is not the way to speak to him.

And if he still doesn't bring home what you requested when the information is right there in his hand, then he needs to go out and bring home a freshly cooked meal at his expense.  What an AH.  This is a big red flag. I was married to a guy who only showed his true colors after I was trapped by having his baby and this is making me think you might be dealing with similar. He needs to shape up and cut this ish out.", "NTA. You serious need to reconsider having anymore children w/ this dude until you figure out the big picture.\n Several reasons: \n1. he is purposefully asking & \"somehow\" keeps forgetting. So why is he asking?- sounds like he's doing it to discount/negate you.\n2. If not, & there's financial issue so food vs junk (broccoli vs sprite), then why isn't he addressing it?\n3. If not, does he keep purposefully forgetting anything that you want for yourself that wouldn't be considered healthy (sprite)? Is he trying to control your appearance? Make you lose some baby weight? My wife has look like ___?", "My husband isn't perfect. After 3 weeks postpartum he started gaming because I ebf and he couldn't help with much since baby only wanted to eat all the time. But if I mentioned needing anything, he ran to get it. I'm not kidding, he literally ran. He watched me give birth and watched me handle being up all day and night feeding and caring for our baby. I often still at 5 months postpartum end up cooking a meal and not being to eat it hot because I feed on demand and prioritize my child. Because I feed everyone in this house, my husband knows its bare-minimum to help me. My car went into the shop one week before birth and it was a full month before we got it back. \n\nDon't let him guilt you. Don't let him have weak arguments.

He doesn't offer to go back though. He still wonders why I refuse to have kids. \n\nTell him to write it down in his phone what you need and the fact that you need him to go to the store to begin with. Tell him you know it's really scary at the grocery store but you're only one text away.You should remind him he is an adult and you just got ripped from V to A so it would be really nice if he show you the slightest respect by writing down what you need. \n\nYes, I would like it if you go back to the store because you came home before you were done shopping. I'm not going to let the fact that you lack the ability to follow a grocery list and come home before you're done, somehow make me the AH here. \n\nLet's see if I have this right. You're the bad guy and you can't count on your husband to complete a mindless task. \n\nYou should tell your husband to stop asking if you need something because he has made it clear that that is too complicated a task for him and you're sick of false hope. It's insulting he ask. Ask him why he asks. Why? What is the purpose of asking?\n\nIf I had a baby and was just ripped from V to A I would DEMAND instacart every time the grocery store gets the better of him. If he needs to work extra hours, so be it. The situation doesn't get to end with your husband patting himself on the back for an attempted grocery store run, makes you feel bad for you asking literally the bare minimum from a partner and then you don't get your sprite. \n\nOh, you're an AH for making him feel bad for not being able to grocery shop? Well he's an AH because it's apparent your husband's plan is to just fail at everything so you will do it all so he can come home and down jack and cokes which he WILL remember to pick up from the store without fail.", "I literally have to text my husband a list if it is over 3 items.
