Summary here.\n\nThanks for support last time. I kind of got in a bad spot after my last post and I took off by myself and I got in a weird headspace where I was trying to talk to my cousin and just thinking of how he\u2019d answer cos I knew him really well. Anyway \u201cAnnabel\u201d\u2019s mom found me - she posted here too and she took me to her place and got my aunt and uncle.\n\nMy uncle says that I half lived with them anyway and they wanted me home with them. It\u2019s been scary coming here because I feel like my cousin is going to come in any moment but it\u2019s actually easier because my aunt and uncle both loved him too. Plus they actually talk to me so I don\u2019t get in my own head as much as I did at my dad\u2019s.\n\nThey\u2019ve also got me a therapist because they say we all need counselling. Therapist seems nice so far.\n\nThings awkward with my dad. Think he took a lot of crap when Alice (Annabel\u2019s mom) told everyone about what had been happening. He\u2019s mad at me because his boss yelled at him and now he thinks he won\u2019t get the promotion he was expecting. \nAnnabel\u2019s mommy friends saw my post too and now that\u2019s causing her problems. Oops. She wants us to do a guided meditation together to realign our relationship but I told my uncle no and he agreed.\nThey put Stacey in therapy on advice of her teacher and the first thing she said was she was only doing the funerals because she wanted to make me sad. I have decided I don\u2019t want to see her any more.\n\nI\u2019m ok. I miss my cousin. I think I always will. But I\u2019m with good people and I will go to them for help next time and not strangers because I know that they will listen.\n\nTl,dr: I moved to live with my aunt and uncle and my dad is pissed", "created_utc": 1674067992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ffcup/update_aita_for_not_participating_in_my_sisters/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Wow, I can't  believe a six year old can be so cruel! Annabel - I'm sorry to say - sounds nuts and maybe the feedback she's getting from friends and family will help her change her views on grief, growth and healing. Also, it's embarrasing that a teacher had to recommend therapy, and not her parents when she started having mock funerals! \n\nI'm glad you're getting help, and that you and your aunt and uncle have each other and can hopefully heal together. I'm so sorry for your loss!", "Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy3aen/aita\\_for\\_refusing\\_to\\_participate\\_in\\_my\\_sisters/", "WTF! I am so incredibly sorry about what you\u2019ve been going through. I am so glad that a responsible adult in your family stepped in to help. How your dad and stepmom were so blinded by how harmful that was to you is disgusting. I hope you and your aunt and uncle are able to heal together and move forward as a close and strong family unit.", "That\u2019s atrocious that a child was that manipulative at that age, however if you look at her mother, I imagine you can see partly why! \n\nI am so happy you\u2019re in a safe and nurturing environment! I get in my own head a lot so I keep sticky notes on me (and a pen) to write down things to keep track, and if you\u2019re really in your head put on a playlist where you know every word, and even if you\u2019ve only got one headphone in you\u2019re a bit distracted, just a little suggestion but best of luck with everything sweet! You are still so young and already so mature, put yourself first and love those that show you love x", "I'm sorry for your lose but hopefully you and your aunt and uncle can all be there to support each other. If what you say about you half sister is true it is deeply concerning and yeah it might be better to cut contact. I'm sorry you father is a useless asshole that only cares about getting his d\\^ck wet and work and not actually about his daughters well being and that your fathers wife is a new age narcissistic moron", "Holy crap that is one cruel 6 year old! Do you know why she wanted to make you sad? Also what kind of hippie is Annabel? I am so sorry for your loss OP but it sound like now you finally have some peace to grieve surrounded by people that actually care about you.", ">\u201cAnnabel\u201d\u2019s mom found me - she posted here too\n\nI'd love to read that post. Has anyone found it?", "Holy smokes, I am so sorry you are going through all of this! What your sister said in therapy is shocking, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve put down some boundaries and aren\u2019t going to see her anymore. It also really sucks that your dad and step-mum only care about the effect this is having on THEM and not on the 16 year old who lost his cousin and best friend. On the bright side, Alice sounds great! Your aunt and uncle, too. I\u2019m super happy you have adults that are standing up for you, and I hope you\u2019re finding some healing with the new support you\u2019re getting.", "Yup seems like the negative flow wasn\u2019t coming from me\n\nShe also told my uncle on the phone that she wants to burn some incense to help heal Stacey\u2019s soul or something but my uncle thinks she\u2019s nuts so he zoned out and can\u2019t remember the details. I think it might have been sage as she does that whenever she thinks things are too negative.", "Early signs of psychopathy can be seen as young as two. \n\nI don\u2019t want to play armchair psychologist but I think most will agree that a 6 year old intentionally inflicting sadness isn\u2019t normal.", "Yeah sorry I should have put that in my post", "Yeah I think I\u2019d got in kind of a loop about not having somewhere to go. Things still suck without my cousin and I\u2019m figuring out which are the ways I can carry him with me and which are the ways I have to work out how to go on on my own. It\u2019s not something we can figure out straight away but we are going to be a team of three now.", "Thanks. I think I just really wanted to talk to my cousin and the therapist says that\u2019s ok to try and do as long as I can do it in a controlled way. Like I can write him letters and things\n\nThis is a really thoughtful comment and I do appreciate it", "Yeah I don\u2019t think she\u2019s like a demon seed or anything but she\u2019s not a nice kid. My aunt says maybe give her time and check back in when she\u2019s older but for now I am done.\nMy dad is a whole other story but yeah my uncle says that even if Dallie hadn\u2019t passed he thinks I would have ended up moving in with them anyway because of how things have been getting", "Nah she was commenting on my old post because she got all freaked out that I\u2019d taken off.\n\nShe isn\u2019t really into internet stuff as she\u2019s a hippy in a different way to Annabel but she got really scared I\u2019d been talking to strangers on the internet and was worried I\u2019d gone off with someone from Reddit \n\nShe also rang basically everyone she could think of including most of my dad\u2019s co workers because she didn\u2019t know any of my friend\u2019s names. \nAnd then someone helped her go on Google earth and she worked out which motel I had gone to and then suddenly she came breaking down the door of my room. It was quite something. And she yelled a lot at the guy who owned the motel for giving a room to a minor and she made him give me my money back. I have been harsh on Alice in the past but she is a good lady", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy3aen/aita\\_for\\_refusing\\_to\\_participate\\_in\\_my\\_sisters/j2agrxr/?context=3", "Nah she\u2019s just a brat. My aunt says she\u2019s just playing off her mom and that if there were stronger boundaries then she wouldn\u2019t have so many social problems", "Trust me you are doing wonderful for your age, and letters are a great way to visualise your own thoughts as well as helping you reach out to your cousin. I am no expert but I would always keep the ending light, mention something you have in common or a private joke, are you learning something new or have you done something he would have enjoyed? And if you\u2019re asking for help, think about how they would respond about the situation, it should help you find more ways to interpret and solve the issue at hand.\n\nAt this age the only thing you need to worry about being is \u2018happy\u2019 and \u2018safe\u2019, you will be more of both at your aunt and uncles. \n\nWe are all rooting for your happiness x", "Thank you!", "Yeah we were only six weeks apart in age and my uncle loved my mom (his sister) very much so we just did everything together. The problem is I know what he would say to most things so making sure I turn off and remember he is gone js sometimes hard especially as I don\u2019t really want  him to be gone. But as long as I am alive then a bit of him is too"]}
