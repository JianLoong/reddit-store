Summary here.\n\nThanks for support last time. I kind of got in a bad spot after my last post and I took off by myself and I got in a weird headspace where I was trying to talk to my cousin and just thinking of how he\u2019d answer cos I knew him really well. Anyway \u201cAnnabel\u201d\u2019s mom found me - she posted here too and she took me to her place and got my aunt and uncle.\n\nMy uncle says that I half lived with them anyway and they wanted me home with them. It\u2019s been scary coming here because I feel like my cousin is going to come in any moment but it\u2019s actually easier because my aunt and uncle both loved him too. Plus they actually talk to me so I don\u2019t get in my own head as much as I did at my dad\u2019s.\n\nThey\u2019ve also got me a therapist because they say we all need counselling. Therapist seems nice so far.\n\nThings awkward with my dad. Think he took a lot of crap when Alice (Annabel\u2019s mom) told everyone about what had been happening. He\u2019s mad at me because his boss yelled at him and now he thinks he won\u2019t get the promotion he was expecting. \nAnnabel\u2019s mommy friends saw my post too and now that\u2019s causing her problems. Oops. She wants us to do a guided meditation together to realign our relationship but I told my uncle no and he agreed.\nThey put Stacey in therapy on advice of her teacher and the first thing she said was she was only doing the funerals because she wanted to make me sad. I have decided I don\u2019t want to see her any more.\n\nI\u2019m ok. I miss my cousin. I think I always will. But I\u2019m with good people and I will go to them for help next time and not strangers because I know that they will listen.\n\nTl,dr: I moved to live with my aunt and uncle and my dad is pissed", "created_utc": 1674067992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ffcup/update_aita_for_not_participating_in_my_sisters/", "score": 544, "replies": ["Wow, I can't  believe a six year old can be so cruel! Annabel - I'm sorry to say - sounds nuts and maybe the feedback she's getting from friends and family will help her change her views on grief, growth and healing. Also, it's embarrasing that a teacher had to recommend therapy, and not her parents when she started having mock funerals! \n\nI'm glad you're getting help, and that you and your aunt and uncle have each other and can hopefully heal together.

I am so incredibly sorry about what you\u2019ve been going through. I am so glad that a responsible adult in your family stepped in to help. How your dad and stepmom were so blinded by how harmful that was to you is disgusting. I hope you and your aunt and uncle are able to heal together and move forward as a close and strong family unit.", "That\u2019s atrocious that a child was that manipulative at that age, however if you look at her mother, I imagine you can see partly why! \n\nI am so happy you\u2019re in a safe and nurturing environment! I get in my own head a lot so I keep sticky notes on me (and a pen) to write down things to keep track, and if you\u2019re really in your head put on a playlist where you know every word, and even if you\u2019ve only got one headphone in you\u2019re a bit distracted, just a little suggestion but best of luck with everything sweet! You are still so young and already so mature, put yourself first and love those that show you love x", "I'm sorry for your lose but hopefully you and your aunt and uncle can all be there to support each other. If what you say about you half sister is true it is deeply concerning and yeah it might be better to cut contact. I'm sorry you father is a useless asshole that only cares about getting his d\\^ck wet and work and not actually about his daughters well being and that your fathers wife is a new age narcissistic moron", "Holy crap that is one cruel 6 year old! Do you know why she wanted to make you sad? Also what kind of hippie is Annabel? I am so sorry for your loss OP but it sound like now you finally have some peace to grieve surrounded by people that actually care about you.", ">\u201cAnnabel\u201d\u2019s mom found me - she posted here too\n\nI'd love to read that post. Has anyone found it?", "Holy smokes, I am so sorry you are going through all of this! What your sister said in therapy is shocking, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve put down some boundaries and aren\u2019t going to see her anymore. It also really sucks that your dad and step-mum only care about the effect this is having on THEM and not on the 16 year old who lost his cousin and best friend. On the bright side, Alice sounds great! Your aunt and uncle, too. I\u2019m super happy you have adults that are standing up for you, and I hope you\u2019re finding some healing with the new support you\u2019re getting.", "Yup seems like the negative flow wasn\u2019t coming from me\n\nShe also told my uncle on the phone that she wants to burn some incense to help heal Stacey\u2019s soul or something but my uncle thinks she\u2019s nuts so he zoned out and can\u2019t remember the details. I think it might have been sage as she does that whenever she thinks things are too negative.", "Early signs of psychopathy can be seen as young as two. \n\nI don\u2019t want to play armchair psychologist but I think most will agree that a 6 year old intentionally inflicting sadness isn\u2019t normal.", "Yeah sorry I should have put that in my post", "Yeah I think I\u2019d got in kind of a loop about not having somewhere to go. Things still suck without my cousin and I\u2019m figuring out which are the ways I can carry him with me and which are the ways I have to work out how to go on on my own. It\u2019s not something we can figure out straight away but we are going to be a team of three now.", "Thanks. I think I just really wanted to talk to my cousin and the therapist says that\u2019s ok to try and do as long as I can do it in a controlled way. Like I can write him letters and things\n\nThis is a really thoughtful comment and I do appreciate it", "Yeah I don\u2019t think she\u2019s like a demon seed or anything but she\u2019s not a nice kid. My aunt says maybe give her time and check back in when she\u2019s older but for now I am done.\nMy dad is a whole other story but yeah my uncle says that even if Dallie hadn\u2019t passed he thinks I would have ended up moving in with them anyway because of how things have been getting", "Nah she was commenting on my old post because she got all freaked out that I\u2019d taken off.\n\nShe isn\u2019t really into internet stuff as she\u2019s a hippy in a different way to Annabel but she got really scared I\u2019d been talking to strangers on the internet and was worried I\u2019d gone off with someone from Reddit \n\nShe also rang basically everyone she could think of including most of my dad\u2019s co workers because she didn\u2019t know any of my friend\u2019s names. \nAnd then someone helped her go on Google earth and she worked out which motel I had gone to and then suddenly she came breaking down the door of my room. It was quite something. And she yelled a lot at the guy who owned the motel for giving a room to a minor and she made him give me my money back. I have been harsh on Alice in the past but she is a good lady", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy3aen/aita\\_for\\_refusing\\_to\\_participate\\_in\\_my\\_sisters/j2agrxr/?context=3", "Nah she\u2019s just a brat. My aunt says she\u2019s just playing off her mom and that if there were stronger boundaries then she wouldn\u2019t have so many social problems", "Trust me you are doing wonderful for your age, and letters are a great way to visualise your own thoughts as well as helping you reach out to your cousin. I am no expert but I would always keep the ending light, mention something you have in common or a private joke, are you learning something new or have you done something he would have enjoyed? And if you\u2019re asking for help, think about how they would respond about the situation, it should help you find more ways to interpret and solve the issue at hand.\n\nAt this age the only thing you need to worry about being is \u2018happy\u2019 and \u2018safe\u2019, you will be more of both at your aunt and uncles. \n\nWe are all rooting for your happiness x", "Thank you!", "Yeah we were only six weeks apart in age and my uncle loved my mom (his sister) very much so we just did everything together. The problem is I know what he would say to most things so making sure I turn off and remember he is gone js sometimes hard especially as I don\u2019t really want  him to be gone. But as long as I am alive then a bit of him is too", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re somewhere safe, OP. And I\u2019d definitely keep far away from your dad, Annabel, and Stacey for quite a while. Honestly, until you get a real apology, I don\u2019t see the point in trying to keep up contact at all. \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, why did your dad\u2019s boss yell at him? Not sure I\u2019m clear on that part (unless it\u2019s unrelated)", "[deleted]", "It's a really stretch saying Stacey is inflicting sadness on purpose. She is just dancing to her mother's tune, she doesn't understand how her make believe is harmful.", "I personally send messages to a social media account of theirs that I know won't get any response. \n\nI don't know if your aunt/uncle/anyone is logged into his accounts but if you know one that won't get looked at, maybe that could work for you? Or texting him?\n\nIt's helped me a lot to be able to message as if I am still able to talk to them. Hopefully it could work for you as well.", "She may not understand how her make believe is harmful (although I think she knows more than you\u2019re giving her credit for), but the fact that she likes making OP sad is pretty gross. Even for a child.", "I love Alice, and I guess its a good reminder that not all bad apples come from a bad tree.", "After a dear friend's husband died I used to write letters from him to her. He was a very wise, warm and funny man and I tried to find his voice from all my memories of him.\n\nI still miss you, Swami.", "I'm so glad Alice found you. You sound like a good kid, OP. I wish you well. I'm sorry for your loss and I hope living with your aunt and uncle helps. Don't think of it as them resenting you for looking like your cousin. Think of it as them being comforted by the love they had for him and you. Take care.", "Dawg that aint a brat, thats a psycho. Trust me, I was the bratty little half sister of 12 years. When I was a dick to my bro (broke his legos when he was away at school bc he wouldnt play barbies with me) my parents were quick to get on my ass and protect my bro's space. Now at 21 and 33, we are pretty cool sibs who like to hang out because he didn't grow up resenting me.  Glad for this update, take care, and so so sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019m so glad you are with your aunt and uncle. I\u2019ve read a lot of Reddit posts, and this is the one I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about after you first posted. You don\u2019t deserve any of their bs, no matter what they say.

Alice is a great person, and I knew your aunt and uncle would likely want you with them.  But I read it all just now and couldn\u2019t say that at the time, and I doubt you would have listened to me.  The closest firsthand adults were failing you in every way, and survivor\u2019s guilt was digging in, and probably still is.  I\u2019m glad you are in a safe place with loving adults.  Your dad is the real AH here and he should have kicked Annabel and her spawn out as soon as she started her sick games.\n\nSo glad you are safe.  And I now think you will recover.  The pain and weight will always be there, but to use a good quote from a show I saw once, which was part of a conversation, Paraphrasing:\n\n\u201cThe pain lessens, but the weight, it stays.\u201d\n\n\u201cForever?\u201d\n\n\u201cEventually, you start to hope so.\u201d", "Kids that age understand more than we think, and if they are doing that, then she probably does understand very well.", "Remember your cousin/best friend/brother honestly.

Yes, Stacey needs therapy but so does her mom. Her mother very openly doesn\u2019t like you and she has imprinted on her daughter that you being miserable makes her happy. So Stacey does it to gain favor from her mother. It\u2019s extremely sad. Your father needs to do better.", "I think in the comments I saw that Alice while looking for him ended up ringing the dads coworkers while trying to track him down.

It is gonna be 8 years next month and as soon as it\u2019s midnight I am gonna start sobbing.\n\nBut in the last 8 years I kind of think of him still being here. Sometimes when I am just driving after work I think of telling him about my day, what\u2019s new. Almost like writing a letter to him in my head. Or when I do something he\u2019d be proud of (I help out some of his relatives I am close to). It\u2019s not the same as having him here, but it helps a lot.", "Whoops! Thank you.", "You went through a hard loss and you should be surrounded by people who love and care about you. The people that will let you grieve and heal and I don't think your useless dad, batshit crazy stepmom, and insensitive sister can let you do that. Stay with your aunt and uncle. I think the three of you need each other.", "I want everyone to remember this post next time someone's assuming a child is innocent and doesn't understand what they're doing. Six year olds can absolutely be purposely cruel, fully understanding what they're doing. It's like everyone has forgotten being that age and how vicious kids can be, far, far worse than adults as they fear the social consequences less. I was bullied at that age by a very nasty girl, your half sister sounds a lot like her. Not only should you avoid her, you should assume she will seek out ways to continue hurting you even if you don't spend time with her, and that she will never grow out of it. Don't trust her around a future wedding for example, or any events that center on you like birthdays or graduations, she will be looking for revenge for you spoiling her fun and exposing what a nasty little shit she is.", "As someone with a very hippie mom who has close friends similar to Annabelle in regards to incense, energy, etc. I can confirm that Annabelle is nuts. Some people take it to a delusional level, once it starts negatively impacting others and they won't even hear you out, they are certifiably crazy. Your dad has majorly flopped on this, I'd recommend distancing yourself from him somewhat because it's unlikely you can trust him with anything important or serious in the future if Annabelle is in the picture. I hope you and your aunt and uncle are all doing well, they sound like good people and so do you.", "burning sage is bad vibes, she\u2019s stealing Native American ritual traditions.

Her daughter on the other hand... is a mess.\n\nEdit: I read some of Alice's comments and she sounds like a gem.", "i think she\u2019s just seeking affirmation and thinks that\u2019s what a funeral is for\u2026 6 year olds are old enough to see if someone is upset about their happiness, so making her sad probably came in later.", "Wait, OP's sister is 6?! That's a whole lot of trouble brewing there if they don't nip that in the bud.", "Holy moly Alice is such a sweetheart, I'm glad OP had someone looking out for him.", "I am so so glad you are doing okay. I was worried reading your last post because I did some scary and looking back, very stupid stuff at your age due too grief and pain that I thankfully survived. My daughter lost her dad, my late husband, on the morning of her 15th birthday, she is now 20. She still writes letters to him and actually mails them. It killed me to pick them up out of the mail and put them in a box for her, but is like a journal that is too painful for her to have with her everyday but said she may want in the future. I have never read them, but she told me some are filled with anger, some with pain, but still others are full of happy memories and now she says many are filled with just telling her dad about how her life is going. Grief is a process and my personal experience is that even though people say it fades with time, I feel it is more like it becomes a part of you. Kind of like my heart beats, my eyes blink, missing my love hurts. I sometimes compare it to a traumatic injury I had years ago, the pain is still there I am just used to it. The beautiful thing is, that like my husband, my daughters dad, your cousin as long as we love them and keep their memories alive they are immortal because we carry them forward with us. I tell people, when they tell me I need to move on that no I do not I just need to move forward and he is coming with me.", "I heard something lovely on another thread that helped me after the loss of a dear friend- Grief is simply love with nowhere to go. The presence of great grief means the presence of great love. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to be sad, this is a hard thing to go through. We are so lucky to get to be apart of others lives, and sometimes we have to focus on the quality of our time rather than the quantity. If you can try to reframe it in your head that grief is simply remembering all the beautiful memories you had together, it may help you process a few things- grief is indeed sorrowful, but can be a way for you to cherish the good times. Grief is a form of love, and we have to remember at the root of it all, we were part of something very special.\n\nThinking of you and your family!", "I am so sorry OP, that is actually pretty sick of Stacey to do and say what she said. I hope that kid can get her head together cause while young, that's messed up", "Jayzus. That was a ride. Thanks for the link.", "I'm so glad Alice caught up with you, and you're with your Uncle and Aunty. So sorry about your cousin.", "My cousin died in 2011 a few months before his 21st. All the cousins/ siblings got tattoos for him. I see him on my body everyday. I talk to him everyday. He is with me every step of the way, he's with all of us, all the time. We keep him alive within ourselves. It's equal parts tragic and amazing and it doesn't get any easier or better but the tears are further apart after a decade. But the tears are still there. He died in March, so that'll be a cry for another day, soon.", "Kid, your strength and maturity continue to impress. And you must be a pretty great guy IRL as well for Alice to go to the lengths she did to find you. You, Alice, and your aunt and uncle have quite the internet fan base. \n\nGlad things are looking up for you. Recovery and grief aren\u2019t linear. You\u2019ll have some really shitty days still, but you\u2019ll have some really amazing ones too. And even if it feels impossible right now, the pain does fade. You\u2019ll never stop missing him or loving him. Years from now, you\u2019ll catch yourself wanting to tell him something and it\u2019ll still be a jolt. The pain will always be there. But it *does* fade. It *does* become bearable.", "It was also used in western europe from the middle age until early 20th century. My own grand-mother used to burn sage after she cleaned the house with bleach as she didn't like the smell of bleach and brunt sage reminded her of her own grand-mother who used it when someone was ill.", "It kinda depends on how the mother handles it with her. If she's internalized that \"making OP sad makes mommy happy\" and she trusts her mother to know whats right, its not unreasonable for a 6 y/o not to question that. It might not make sense to her but most things adults do make no sense to 6 y/os and they usually are important and ultimately good."]}
