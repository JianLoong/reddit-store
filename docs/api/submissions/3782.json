I love to cook and cook regularly for my mom, my son (8m) and I and so mom has bragged to her sisters (aunt) about my cooking so I was requested to cook. I came up with a rice based casserole with meat, bell peppers, and cheese and seasoned with my home made taco seasoning that would suit all our tastes, except my son (I'll get to that in a bit), and even toned down the spices because my aunt and uncle very much dislike spice. I thought everything was all set and perfect. \n\nOn Monday evening I found out that two of my aunts five children would also be joining us Beth (20f) and Bill (17m). Which is a problem. Bill won't eat any meat but hamburgers, anything with veggies in it, or rice and Beth won't eat anything spicier than table pepper, anything with veggies in it, or anything with rice mixed with other stuff. (This family orders chicken wings plain and dips them in ketchup.) Meaning they would not be able to make what I had planned, but already prepared the casserole and put it in the fridge so i would just have to bake it on Tuesday evening. I'm out of work on disability so i can't afford to let food to go to waste. I decided that since my son has food issues (too long to go into detail here but I'd be happy to explain if anyone asks) and I already was planning on making him grilled cheese, i figured I'd just make a few more for them too and tell them they could choose which they wanted. \n\nTuesday came and we had... An evening (we're very different people so it's always a bit awkward). But over all it was pleasant. My cousins chose to eat the grilled cheese as did my son, and everyone else ate my casserole. There were no complaints. \n\nWednesday afternoon I started getting texts in my cousins group chat saying that I offended them by making grilled cheese because it was infantile and it meant I thought they were babyish. I told them I did that because I don't ever want someone to leave my house hungry and I knew they wouldn't eat the dish I made so what else was I supposed to do. They said I should have made them spaghetti. (In my family spaghetti also includes my grandma's famous home made sauce.) I told them they were being ridiculous and entitled brats and they were lucky I was considerate to make them food at all. Which I guess was a bad choice. They told their mom who told the entire family and now it's a big mess of drama and everyone is fighting about it and I feel really guilty because I \n\n1- made them grilled cheese which is treating them like babies \n\n2- called them entitled brats because they wanted spaghetti instead\n\nSo aita for assuming they wouldn't eat my food and making them grilled cheese which they saw as baby food?", "created_utc": 1669998776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaqm3n/aita_for_making_my_cousins_grilled_cheese_for_a/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don't have allergies, they're just picky.) This was very disrespectful towards you and you still graciously made a plan that worked for you and your budget.

They essentially admitted they would not eat what you made and instead you should have known to make a more complicated, expensive time consuming dish. Rather then tell them to eat what I made or don't eat. Did they even say thank you?", "NTA, I'm 60 and love a good grilled cheese sandwich both at home and sometimes eating out!", "Mmmmm, grilled cheese.\n\nNow I'm hungry.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and your family needs to adopt the potluck girl from yesterday", "And them whining about grilled cheese being baby food?? I'm 60 and grilled cheese sandwiches are delightful adult food.", "Exactly.  The gall of thinking others have to cater to everyone's eating habits is getting ridiculous.  If it is a scheduled big holiday dinner, ok, you try to a reasonable  extent. But this was a relatively unplanned dinner. You turn up like that,  you get what you get.", "Agreed! And there are so many different kinds of grilled cheese, but sometimes cheap white bread and Kraft American cheese is absolutely delicious.", "But it is only THEIR responsibility to manage it. It is not in anyone else. \n\nAnd these people are babies because they are insulted over being feed something simple when they don\u2019t plan for themselves.", "Yeah I was heavily physically abused when it came to food for a child and as a result I have very disordered eating. It's been made worse by the fact that covid seems to have permanently altered my tastebuds. Now I'll go an entire 24 hours+ without eating because everything makes me feel sick to my stomach when I eat it.", "Please don't use \"wheelchair bound\" the preferred phrase is \"wheelchair user\". Thanks \ud83d\ude01\n\n (disabled and dietarily restricted here, both impact day to day life and require accommodations)", "Duly noted. Thanks. I have little first hand input on that.", "Why would you be the AH for assuming they didn't want to eat your meal when they DIDNT?\n\nSounds to me like you were super insightful, know em better than they know themselves. You're NTA. But I get that some people don't like eating spicier food or whatever but what's life without trying something new. For all they know they could have really liked your dish. Oh well.", "I side with the chef. NTA.", "NTA. Eat it or beat it  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af \n\nYou were more than nice enough to provide an alternative for them to eat, not your fault they're entitled brats", "NTA for so many reasons, but what really sticks out to me is how these 2 nearly grown children don't eat any vegetables??? Like do they have some sensory processing issue? Or are they just spoiled brats?", "NTA - you handled the 5 surprise guests as best as you could.", "Wah, I no want grillded cheese.  I notta baby.  I wantd pasketti. \n\n\\*stomps their foot and crosses their arms, while the other throws themselves down on the floor screeching bloody murder.   \n\nNTA.", "Do you mean the one with the ape pie or is there another one?", "The fucking nerve of them calling grilled cheese baby food, when their own food pickiness is the actual baby behavior. F them. NTA", "There\u2019s a craft brewery in my town that just opened up and all of their food is various grilled cheese sandwiches. I haven\u2019t been, but\u2026yum. There\u2019s a ton of fun options.", "A few years back a friend was going to visit from out of town.  I was planning a nice dinner with her and other friends that live locally.  Was going to take half a day off work to do the prep and cooking.\n\nThen found out that due to her schedule the dinner would have to be the day of her arrival.  All the others could make it but I had no prep/cooking time.  So, I assembled a big stack of ham (shaved works best) and cheese sandwiches ready to grill, and dumped two bags of potato chips (regular and barbecue) into bowls.  Had the George Foreman grill right there on the dining table as I cooked the sandwiches as needed, we ate chips, and drank wine.\n\nBEST DINNER PARTY EVER!  We all still talk about how wonderful it was and it\u2019s served as a model for other occasions by group members.\n\nPulled some Dove bars out of the freezer later for dessert.  Perfect!", "That sounds amazing!  Craft beer and gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches?  Sign me up!  Now you need to go and report back.", "I only want to add that it's good that you care for your son like that. It can be tricky dealing with food issues and I imagine the food based abuse makes it a bit harder to help in that area"]}
