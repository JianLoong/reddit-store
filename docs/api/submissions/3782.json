Sorry for any spelling, grammar, or formatting issues.) \n\nOn Saturday (as of posting it is Friday) I (32F) found out my aunt and uncle would be coming over to the home my mom and I on Tuesday share for my uncle to put up shelves and my mom to give them both haircuts (my mom does hair dresser as a second job). I love to cook and cook regularly for my mom, my son (8m) and I and so mom has bragged to her sisters (aunt) about my cooking so I was requested to cook. I came up with a rice based casserole with meat, bell peppers, and cheese and seasoned with my home made taco seasoning that would suit all our tastes, except my son (I'll get to that in a bit), and even toned down the spices because my aunt and uncle very much dislike spice. I thought everything was all set and perfect. \n\nOn Monday evening I found out that two of my aunts five children would also be joining us Beth (20f) and Bill (17m). Which is a problem. Bill won't eat any meat but hamburgers, anything with veggies in it, or rice and Beth won't eat anything spicier than table pepper, anything with veggies in it, or anything with rice mixed with other stuff. (This family orders chicken wings plain and dips them in ketchup.) Meaning they would not be able to make what I had planned, but already prepared the casserole and put it in the fridge so i would just have to bake it on Tuesday evening. I'm out of work on disability so i can't afford to let food to go to waste. I decided that since my son has food issues (too long to go into detail here but I'd be happy to explain if anyone asks) and I already was planning on making him grilled cheese, i figured I'd just make a few more for them too and tell them they could choose which they wanted. \n\nTuesday came and we had... An evening (we're very different people so it's always a bit awkward). But over all it was pleasant. My cousins chose to eat the grilled cheese as did my son, and everyone else ate my casserole. There were no complaints. \n\nWednesday afternoon I started getting texts in my cousins group chat saying that I offended them by making grilled cheese because it was infantile and it meant I thought they were babyish. I told them I did that because I don't ever want someone to leave my house hungry and I knew they wouldn't eat the dish I made so what else was I supposed to do. They said I should have made them spaghetti. (In my family spaghetti also includes my grandma's famous home made sauce.) I told them they were being ridiculous and entitled brats and they were lucky I was considerate to make them food at all. Which I guess was a bad choice. They told their mom who told the entire family and now it's a big mess of drama and everyone is fighting about it and I feel really guilty because I \n\n1- made them grilled cheese which is treating them like babies \n\n2- called them entitled brats because they wanted spaghetti instead\n\nSo aita for assuming they wouldn't eat my food and making them grilled cheese which they saw as baby food?", "created_utc": 1669998776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaqm3n/aita_for_making_my_cousins_grilled_cheese_for_a/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA, nobody was stopping them from eating the adult food. Maybe you do think they are babyish, but it doesn't make you TA, because they are. I really don't get all these stories about adults who only eat limited number of food without vegetables - pizza, spaghetti and burgers. I like the junk food time to time, but all the time? Nope...", "NTA  \n\n\nYour are not a restaurant, they don't get to dictate to you what to serve them. On top of that, they basically come unannounced, so you had to improvise something for them. The fact they can't recognise/accept these two points does make them, indeed, \"entitled brats\".", "NTA\n\n>1- made them grilled cheese which is treating them like babies \n\nThey eat like babies, so they treated like one..\n\n>2- called them entitled brats because they wanted spaghetti instead\n\nThey should have asked before the day what you were planning to cook, and then /politely/ asked if was possible to make some spaghetti for them.\n\nGeez... I'm a pick eater, but when invited to a place new or different, I ask about the food before and when not possible to have something I like, I eat before/after. And apologize for not been a good guest. It's not the host problem if I'm a pick eater, it's mine.", "They were coming to your house, not a restaurant.  NTA. Also, how immature are they, worrying that grilled cheese is \"babyish\"?  Grilled cheese is delicious!", "NTA; You made food, they had options and choices.  Their choice was grilled cheese,  it could've been the other food you prepared or nothing at all.", "NTA - you're on a budget and had already planned and prepared a meal without being informed of the amount of people that were coming to your home. They (it sounds like) invited themselves over without much notice, and are expecting you to cater to their food wants (not needs, there is a difference between a food need and a food want. They don't have allergies, they're just picky.) This was very disrespectful towards you and you still graciously made a plan that worked for you and your budget. Heck, I'm 33 and I still love getting a grilled cheese. It's not infantilizing someone to make them a grilled cheese. If they're this picky, they should provide for themselves.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd honestly, I'm so confused . . . this is the second or third post I've seen in the last few months insisting that grilled cheese is \"for babies\" or young children. Where on earth did that idea come from? \n\nGrilled cheese is a standard on the menu (and I DON'T mean the kids' menu) of everything from greasy spoon diners to gourmet restaurants (I've had some VERY fancy grilled cheese sandwiches with amazing high-end cheeses, fruit like apples and pears, and yummy gourmet condiments over the years). I've literally NEVER heard of grilled cheese being a food specifically for young children until AITA. Was it a childhood favourite and comfort food? Sure. But so was meatloaf and mashed potatoes, or lots of other foods that adults also eat.\n\nSometimes I think people who show up to this sub just have the misfortune of having some of the weirdest families with the most odd ideas around . . . You are definitely NTA for giving your guests a very normal food that lots of adults love.", "NTA grilled cheese is awesome. If they cared about how it looked they should have ate the other dish", "NTA. You went out of your way to accommodate everyone. If they wanted spaghetti, they should have made it themselves and brought it over to share.

Seriously I'm about to be 38, and I'd be stoked if someone offered me grilled cheese. Especially well made grilled cheese.", "Nta. They deserved it. You were kind enough to give them what they got.", "NTA\n\nThey weren\u2019t even initially invited. They were given an option of food. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA I'd be stoked if you made me a grilled cheese. There's no age limit on grilled cheese.", "Tell the entitled brats that are your cousins to stay home the next time.", "NTA.

That's news to me. I made some to go with stew this week for everyone in my family. \n\nIf they wanted you to make spaghetti,  they could have asked ahead of time if you'd please do that since they enjoy it so much.

They could have tried some of the casserolle if they didn't want the grilled cheese. \n\nI'm not a super picky eater, but there are some things I really don't enjoy eating, like mushrooms. (The texture is just not my thing.) If I was brought to a dinner at the last minute and the host said to me \"hey, I had already made a mushroom casserolle for dinner tonight, but I know that's not something you really like, so I made you some grilled cheese!\" I'd be absolutely touched. Was calling them brats maybe rude? Yeah, sure, but they were the ones complaining to you about accommodating them at the last minute. They ARE being entitled. Fully NTA.

They do have children's pallettes, but grilled cheese is also on many adult menus. And that meat spaghetti they required is frequently on kid's menus. Coupled with the bratty whining about dinner at a guest's house leads me to think they both ARE giant babies and you should buy some bibs and sippy cups for their next visit.", "NTA. The fact that they could only eat food that is considered infantile (and it is) should be a moment of clarity about their eating habits", "They eat like babies, what do they actually expect? NTA.\n\nCheese toasties are yummy anyway.", "NTA. What's wrong with grilled cheese? \n\nThat's what you get for making sure everyone knows you have the palate of a toddler.\n\nThis was a no-win situation and you should knock them down a few pegs by pointing out how terrible they are as guests, uninvited ones, at that. The fucking cheek of some people.", "NTA\n\nYou found out late that they were coming after you had already made the dinner, and it doesn't really sound like you invited them anyways, so you made them a sandwich.  Also, they have some weird diet restrictions which isn't your problem.  I guess I probably would have offered them the casserole, knowing that they wouldn't eat it, then offered to make them sandwiches instead but doesn't really matter.\n\nSeems like no big deal to me and they are just being entitled/weird.  Tell both of them to learn how to eat adult food then next time they can have what the adults are eating... what kind of adults don't eat spicy food, vegetables or anything but hamburgers?  Sounds like my 6 year old niece.", "NTA. When I'm at someone's home and they offer me food I either kindly decline or graciously accept. I don't ask for alternatives of what they have prepared and if they offer I plead with them not to go through any extra trouble on my behalf. This goes for my mom who never wants her kids hungry to my friends who out of love and friendship feel compelled to offer me food when I visit. That is all anyone should be doing. Demanding accomodations because you're a picky eater is beyond selfish and entitled.", "They are old enough to be able to make and bring their own sandwiches or spaghetti. \u201cGrilled cheese is babyish,\u201d get a grip; they are infantile for saying such a goofy thing.

All my best to you, and I hope you keep cooking for yourself and others who appreciate it for many, many years.", "Soooo NTA - and I would recommend you send EVERYONE in the family chat a link to this post.  We got your back, kid.  You were very generous not only with your time but with the little resources you have.  They were guests in your home that you accommodated.  If they have a problem with what you did, call them out.  They have ABSOLUTELY no right to say anything about your generosity.  If they are picky eaters that is something that THEY have to absorb not you.  Just because they don't want certain food does NOT obligate anyone to conform to their wants, not needs, WANTS.  What a bunch of assholes.", "They seem to be entitled brats, but it maybe wasn't nice telling them.", "NTA\n\nWhy do peoples family read into things so far? If someone offered to make me something because they knew I wouldn't like what they cooked I would be grateful. That just shows how considerate you are. Plus a grilled cheese is always tasty. Idk maybe my family is more casual but this wouldn't be a problem at all. I think they are probably projecting their own insecurities about being perceived as childish for their food choices.", "NTA people who are insanely picky can deal with getting limited options or bring their own food.\n\ne: especially because if I read it right they were surprise guests and not actually invited?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
