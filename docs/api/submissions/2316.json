Did you speak to the younger 2 before you left? Did you make any plans w/ the whole family once you got back?\n\nI do think a large part of this is on your husband for not handling the situation while you were gone. I'm guessing he was resentful for having to deal with it instead of turning it into special time with daddy, he just punted.", "There needs to be an option for \u201cNTA but you executed that poorly\u201d \n\nYour hearts clearly in the right place but did you really think that an 11 and 9 year old would be able to understand the emotional nuance of the situation? Did you really not have a conversation with the younger two in advance of the trip explaining what you were doing and why? Did you really make no plans to have a special time or activity with the other two? \n\nNta but come on, you don\u2019t get to be surprised by the other kids reactions to this.", "NAH.  The kids arent mature enough to understand why you did that, but you didnt do anything wrong.", "NTA even if there wasn't the split between adopted and birth children, it would be appropriate sometimes to do a trip with just the older kids in my opinion.  Just do something with the younger 2 at some point too.  \n\nFair is not everyone getting the same, its everyone getting what they need.\n\nYour husband should be backing you up here.", "NAH\n\nI think it was appropriate to give the kids that are in distress some time away to decompress.\n\nBut it makes sense the younger children were upset. They're too young to understand special circumstances and this is a time to start teaching them about this.\n\nBeing adopted is not fun and while your younger two are upset, this is time to teach them that sometimes people who are hurting the most need a little extra support. Perhaps also take the two of them out for something smaller and fun for them, but not equal to what their older siblings got.", "NTA - take the other 2 away next weekend.\n\nI feel like your husband should have made some plans with Emily and Prue while you were away with Sophie and Michael.\n\nWhy did that not happen?  I feel like this issue should not have been a surprise for you and your husband and you should have planned something with the other 2 in the beginning - or at least explained what the others were going through.", "NTA. Your trying your best here. Take them out for a treat and explain it to them. One day they\u2019ll realize they didn\u2019t have to go through the same experience. Maybe plan a whole family trip and make them choose the place or plan something special for them so they don\u2019t feel neglected. Sorry this is tough hope it becomes easier for all of you \ud83d\udc95", "Nta. Why couldn\u2019t husband treat the youngest to something?", "NTA. Different kids have different needs. Nothing is equal but all things must be fair. The younger kids need to learn that they will not get everything the older ones get for various reasons and vice versa. You did nothing wrong. The older two needed that for reasons probably unknown to the younger kids.", "NTA, it sounds like Emily and Prue need to be sat down for a chat to reiterate that you love them all equally but the other two are having a rough time right now. Sometimes it can be hard for younger kids to understand the issues that others face and how severe they can be. You did the right thing in giving the older two some time away and space from the issue. Keep it up, I\u2019m sure those kids feel incredibly supported right now!", "NTA- I think you need to sit down again with Emily and Prue to discuss why exactly you took the other 2 to the beach without them. They are old enough to be having these types of conversations. It's been a couple of days now so hopefully they have calmed down a little and are able to have the conversation without crying", "NTA for taking them, but you could have handled it better with the younger two. \n\nThe two older kids definitely needed that time away, without younger sibs around. But you & your husband should have planned something with the younger two while you were away. Maybe he could have taken them to an amusement park, done a camping trip, something to make them feel special too. Would have saved you all a lot of trouble. It's always going to feel unfair when some siblings get a vacation and the others do not, and 9 is young enough that really understanding the complexity here is a big ask. So it might be worth giving the younger 2 a special trip for just the two of them soon, so they don't feel left out.", "NAH\n\nBut Sophie and Michael needed to feel the support of their siblings just as much as you. Don't make this mistake again. \n\nIf you must separate the kids, take all the girls out for treats while your husband has some bonding time with Michael.", "NAH, but your husband kind of failed on his end of things. He should have done something fun and special with your littles while you were away with the other kids. I don\u2019t think there are any assholes here because I understand why the little kids are upset. I\u2019d mend fences by doing something fun, just you and them soon.", "NTA. Kids need times away from their siblings sometimes. Your older kids needed some time to relax from a stressful situation. The younger ones don\u2019t right now, but they\u2019re kids and don\u2019t see that. It\u2019s okay for kids to be upset sometimes. They don\u2019t need to get everything they want 100% of the time.", "NTA\n\nThis is a good teachable moment for your younger children.  Sometimes people need space, even away from people they love and are their family, to cope with a super difficult situation.  It's self-care.  It's not meant to purposefully exclude or make other family members feel second best.  It's for their mental health. Your older two deserved a break to help lower their stress level and breathe for a moment.", "NTA, kids need to learn that they're not always going to be treated exactly the same. That's just life", "NTA but maybe should've been approached differently. Maybe you husband should've done something with the girls while you other 3 were elsewhere so that it didn't sting. They are a bit young to understand this complex problem.", "NAH. I was scared it was going to go the other way, as I\u2019ve sadly seen too many of these where there\u2019s clear favoritism towards the bio kids. Your younger children will get over it when they\u2019re old enough to have the empathy to understand what a truly hard time it is for your older kiddos. You did the right thing in trying to explain to them why you made an exclusive trip and are treating them special. You\u2019re a good parent :) They don\u2019t know what it would entail to be adopted and just see that \u2018mom took them and didn\u2019t take us to a fun place - I want to be in their position\u2019 without comprehending what they\u2019re wishing for.\n\nEDIT: initial judgment error - from not to none here", "More info needed - do you do things separately with just Prue and Emily?  I can see how they'd feel left out, especially at their young age.  However, if you make an effort to do this often by taking trips with just the girls, or just the boys, or 2 of 4, then it seems okay, I would just do something special with Emily and Prue to \"keep the score even\" I guess.  But if this was a one time thing, then yea, I think you unintentionally did something to hurt your kids feelings here.", "NTA\n\nYour natural born kids are just being kids. Which sometimes means immature and spoiled. It's not different than kids getting upset when it's a sibling's birthday and they are getting all the attention and gifts. It sounds like you've tried your best to explain the situation, but at their ages they are still a little young to understand the complicated family dynamics at play.\n\nWhile this goes again my normal parental thinking, if the girls are truly that upset, what I would suggest is maybe setting up a separate activity for just the two of them (obviously the older kids will understand), and then do something with the entire family the following week.\n\nThen going forward, maybe set up different events that focus on different kids or different combinations.", "NTA, your husband could take the younger two out somewhere for ice cream or something while you take the older two to the beach as planned. I think they'd benefit from the one on one time with you while the' little's' spend time with their dad.", "NTA. The younger kids need to get over it. The older ones needed extra care and you made a decision to give it.   \nYou could do something special for the younger ones, though. Something to reassure them that they are just as loved and special as the older 2. Actions speak louder than words. So maybe let them know how you feel about them and what the purpose of the private trip was, and offer them their own private trip or special event that is catered to them that the older 2 wouldn't be particularly interested in.  \n\nLet them know that raising kids isn't about a contest. There is no favoritism. It's called parenting and let them know you are sorry they were hurt but you hope they can understand after knowing why you made that decision and that hurting them was not your intent. You are doing your best.", "NTA\u2014 however I would learn from this. Its possible the other two think you don\u2019t care when they are as hurt. Don\u2019t overcompensate just something to keep in mind going forward.", "NTA--your heart was in the right place, and your logic is sound.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no logic to feeling left out, and you absolutely should not be explaining to the young ones all about your older kids' issues.\n\nWhat you CAN do, and no one will fault you for, is to take the younger 2 on their own beach weekend.\n\nALSO:  Sophie and Michael are YOUR children and have been for five years.  Their birth father has no rights here, and you should emphasize that to them AND to him.  (Sophie is an adult now anyway.) They should NOT feel obliged to meet with this man and they absolutely are justified in having negative feelings about him.", "NTA, but it sounds a bit like your husband is dumping this all on you and didn't make an effort to help the younger kids (do something special with them at the same time and/or help them understand that each kids' needs are different at different times and what you both do for them is different at different times.\n\n1. Kids don't really appreciate the difference between \"bad mood\" and \"traumatized\".\n2. The former dad should not be allowed to contact the kids until and unless they are ready to talk with him. They need to see a counselor to help them process everything.\n3. Your younger two may also benefit from seeing a counselor if they are having great difficulty in understanding the difference in need/keep feeling left out. (The counseling doesn't have to be a long term thing.)\n4. If your husband has, in fact, been dumping responsibility for managing everything on you, then you and he may also need counseling. Him to understand why he needs to step up; you to understand how to proceed if your husband isn't invested in helping. Even if he is helping, you two may benefit from understanding how to best help all the kids.", "I\u2019m gonna go with YTA. I know that\u2019s not gonna be popular however children have feelings and I have wondered why you treat the adoptive kids better than you do your own children? Do you do things with just your own children and not the adopted kids? If the kids get along there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t bring them all to have a good time and then spend some time discussing all of this with the adopted kids.\n\nThey are all your kids and no one likes to be treated differently. Why hurt your own children? Saying that they\u2019ll get over it and they\u2019re being brats it\u2019s not fair. They make get over it move on but this will always be in their mind that their second in their household.\n\nI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t even thought of your other children. I agree that the husband should take the other two on a nice trip too. That will probably help but it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s going to do that. Another thought might be to take the other two on a trip next week just the two of them.\n\nIt\u2019s all in how you approach this I understand you\u2019re trying to do a good thing but you are forgetting about the other two and how their feelings are. Well it might not seem logical to you it makes them feel like they aren\u2019t wanted or coming in second.\n\nI would definitely sit them down and tell them that you have planned a nice beach trip for them alone too I\u2019m sure they would be more than happy about that.", "Info do you ever do stuff with just the younger two? If you don\u2019t then of course they are going to feel bad, they see there older siblings getting special trips but they don\u2019t.", "YTA slightly.\n\nALL the kids need support, not just the adopted ones. I think you need to plan a weekend trip with the other two now, because it is being perceived as favoritism whether that's rightly or wrongly perceived that way.", "NTA. I think you should do something with just the younger two to \"make up for it.\" Your intentions were good, and I think your younger two will recognize the value in how you did things when they are older. They're just too young to get it right now.\n\nIn the future, I think that you should organize two separate trips if you can.", "NTA, the older kids needed to get away for a bit and to relax and have fun. Get their minds off the current situation is most likely the best for them all things considered. \n\nThe two younger kids don\u2019t understand and are jealous that the older kids got to go to the beach with mom. You could always take the two younger kids to get ice cream or something, or even take them to the beach so they have their own little get away. \n\nOr you can tell them no and that life is not fair and sometimes they don\u2019t get to do things that other people get to do. But no, not the asshole.", "Nta", "Soft YTA. You should have sat your younger kids down and explained that you were going to have a day with the older two because they needed extra time with you before you went. To them it just looks like you wanted a fun beach day without them. It\u2019s a great moment to teach them that each of them can have special time with mom and that doesn\u2019t mean you love any one of them less.", "YTA why wouldn't you take all the girls? Of course that's going to cause issues. You singled out two and left them out of a fun day with their sisters.", "Soft YTA. You should have asked them before hand how they would feel about it.  They might have still been mad but at least you could have explained before and maybe made other plans. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t know if this was a day trip or like a flight involved?  That makes a big difference too if it was several days you were gone.", "NTA. \n\nYou acted out of love and concern.  It has had consequences that you didn't expect, but you can assure the two youngest that if they need something special you'll be there for them too.", "NTA. The younger two dont' get it and your husband needs to support you in that.", "NTA, but maybe take the girls for some alone time with you too? Maybe not the beach, but maybe an indoor water park or amusement park? \n\nThe youngest ones clearly just don\u2019t understand the situation and that\u2019s ok, but maybe they just need to know they are a priority for you as well.", "NTA. \nI can see how the younger ones would feel left out, but an explanation on why, amd maybe a trip with them should be enough.", "NTA\n\nDifferent kids need different things at different times.\n\nBeing an effective parent isn't about giving each kid exactly the same thing every single time.  It's about giving each kid what they need when they need it. \n\nYour youngest kids likely still need stories and snuggles and time at playgrounds and setting up playdates and organising birthday parties.\n\nYour eldest need some time to focus and relax. You gave them that. That's important. Bringing the youngest would have changed the mood a lot.\n\n\nSo long as it's not part of a pattern of favouring one set of kids, it's a really good idea to meet the kids where they are at.\n\nAnd your husband's first instinct should have been to reinforce that. Of course the kids were fussed they didn't get a beach day. He should have been ready to deflect.", "NTA Their needs are different and you took that into account and did something for them. Your husband needs to have your back and help explain.", "**Gentle YTA**\n\nI get why you did what you did, and I genuinely believe that you felt this was the right thing, and understand why, but you can provide support and extra attention to some of your kids who are struggling without creating a hard division between your kids that's going to cause even more problems and resentment in the long run.\n\nI say this as someone who was severely ill and struggled with my mental health as a teenager. My parents also paid extra attention to me, and at the time genuinely did not believe that they were doing so to the detriment of my younger sibling, because they had legitimate reasons for it (they had every reason to believe that they might lose me, TBH), and they still loved her deeply of course. But that's NOT how she perceived it . . . she felt hurt, and excluded, and ended up with Borderline Personality Disorder because of the trauma of feeling like our parents had chosen me over her. Even though she understood the reasoning on some level, it didn't hurt her any less or make her feel any less abandoned that they spent extra time with me.\n\nAs someone suggested, you could have taken them ALL to the beach but carved out one-on-one time while there to talk to the teenagers and let them unburden themselves to you. There are ways to do this that don't involve making it look and feel to the younger ones like you are drawing a line down the middle of your family, where they are on one side and their adoptive siblings on the other. Tread very carefully . . . you may not realise how much resentment you're creating or what the repercussions could be. I agree with you that the older ones need extra attention; but that can be done in ways that don't feel exclusive.", "NTA\n\nIt's a complicated situation with no clear right answer. Hopefully you can get husband to see and understand that - it's not about you/him being right or wrong; it's about the 2 of you working together to create the best path forward in a tough situation. \n\nBravo for adopting the older kids. Don't try to convince the younger kids of anything all at once. They are kids and will see things the way they see it. Just consistently love them and be honest with them, and as they get older they will hopefully understand.", "NTA but you should have gently explained to your younger kids that their siblings needed a break from them as well.", "NTA - this is the perfect opportunity to show the younger tow that just because you are family doesn't mean everyone gets the same all the time.  A very good lesson to learn.  Take the younger two to the beach another time and start to normalise occasional family outings where not everyone is included.", "NTA, but you could have saved yourself and the kiddos some heartache by setting this up better. \n\nIt's okay for your kids to understand that mom and dad take care of each of them differently sometimes, because they are all individuals with individual needs. But that understanding has to be taught, with lots of compassion.", "NTA and your youngest two are sounding entitled. You don't have to do everything with all of your kids. If I take my youngest out for lunch that doesn't mean I'm playing favourites, it means that we're spending some time together.", "Nta. Suggest your husband take the younger 2 away for a weekend.", "I'm going to say NTA, but perhaps you should plan something to do with the younger 2.  It is clear you are acting out of love, but I can certainly see how an 11YO and a 9YO would be upset and feel left out.  Talk to them, try to explain why you did this for the older 2 and see if there is something you can plan for just the younger 2.

In that time, your eldest children needed to get away and clear their heads after their birth father got back into contact. Giving them a weekend away where the focus was solely on them was smart. If all your children were there, it's a guarantee that your youngest children could have divided your attention and it wouldn't have been beneficial to Sophie or Michael.\n\nI do think your husband dropped the ball on caring for the youngest children, though. They clearly were not informed that this trip was for a special reason and it probably did lead them to believe that favoritism was at play when it wasn't.

Which is natural.\n\nYour intentions were pure/your heart was in the right place so NTA.\n\nStop beating yourself up over it.\n\n(But maybe next time explain the reasons to your other girls before you spend time alone with their older siblings without them. You can't expect them to understand the situation if you don't explain)", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong, in fact you did things right by the elder two. \n\nThe younger two are old enough to know that you don't get the same things, do they all get presents on each others birthdays? It's important that the younger two understand that the older ones needed some time with you alone because they were going through a hard time.\n\nYour husband could have done better, and shouldn't be shirking the blame onto your shoulders. He could have easily explained what was happening and why you were away for a few days.\n\nAgain, NTA", "NTA - it is important for children to have one-on-one time with parents. And the reasons that prompted the beach vacation are ones that require some sensitivity and privacy to encourage them to be able speak to you. \n\nHowever, I can see why your other 2 children are upset & jealous.  Why don't you take them on a trip or do a special activity just for the younger ones to balance things out?  What interests a 9 yo is usually not of interest to an 18 year old so sometimes these activities are better done separate.", "Just give them a turn.", "NAH but you didn't think things through. Obviously they would think you were playing favorites.\n\nNow take them on a weekend vacation alone too.", "NTA\n\nI can understand why the younger 2 are upset, looking from their perspective and age it makes sense. But I also know that children should feel important, and the 2 oldest really needed some extra care right now. Id say take the younger 2 for something really fun, something that they will love. Im sure the older 2 would be able to understand if you explained it to them.", "NTA", "NTA, it was one day.  The younger ones are probably just acting out because the older ones are getting more attention - admittedly negative attention they don't want, but attention nonetheless.", "NTA . Agreed. And to add to this\u2026Maybe arrange for Dad to take the 2 younger ones somewhere for a weekend. That\u2019ll give them what they feel they missed out on & it\u2019ll also give you & the older kids a chance to further discuss the situation. I hope all works out.", "That's why imo is NAH, the biological father of the two oldest is the oy issue, everyone in the post is trying their best to navigate a very delicate situation, OP isn't an AH for wanting to cheer up her kids and the two younger daughters aren't AH for being upset cause they \"missed out\" on a beach day. \n\n\nSending lots of hugs to OP, hope your family goes through this soon.", "Exactly. One of these kids is 18, but you're not gonna hand the youngest one the car keys because the oldest got them the day before. It sounds a bit like they've been so careful to make sure the family was inclusive that they never took the time, which I understand takes a lot, to make clear they're all different as well and that's good/fine/and correct.", "Thank you! This is the comment I was looking for. There will be times when the younger two need more attention than the older two. But right now, the older two need it most.

It\u2019s healthy to do 1 on 1 activities with your kids, or to only do things with some of the kids. The parents should try this more often. Just things with the girls, something special with just Michael.  This is normal.", "This is the best comment. Exactly this \n\nNTA", "I have special days/outings with all of the kids a few times a month. But I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve been distant with the younger two because of everything with Sophie and Michael. Those two are a wreck and I\u2019m trying to field their father\u2019s persistence, threat of legal activity, and the two kids varying reactions, among everything else. It\u2019s a mess.", "Agree...  It's not a matter of tik for tak (which this thread loves) but of which child needs what at which time... It could have been explained better and sometimes, taking 1 or 2 children to do something is more beneficial to the children.. \n\nI'd also have a serious conversation with all the children explaining that not everything can be about all of them & their selfish needs", "This all would have probably gone over fine if you had divided and conquered, you taking the oldest two somewhere special, your husband taking the other two somewhere special. Nobody is left out. NTA persay but you should have planned this out better so no one felt excluded.", "I totally get you don't have plans yet. I was just suggesting you might have made plans when you first talked to them and made funner plans for your daughter w/ your husbnd.\n\nI'm sure you were in a tough spot, were worried about your oldest, and made some rather fast plans. I don't think you did anything wrong taking the other 2 for some down time for a couple of days, I just think hindsight is 20/20 and there should have been petter plans in place for the 2 younger ones, like line up a friend to take them to the zoo or someplace fun on Friday.", "Why don\u2019t you plan a trip with the other kids? So it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re putting them second. I know your heart was in the right place but you gotta think of all the kids.  I hope you plan a nice trip for them too.\n\nWhile you meant well I can see where the kids are coming from. Has this been a problem all of their lives because the adopted kids need more than the bio kids emotionally?\n\nI mean the dad had to work so you can\u2019t really blame him for dropping the ball. In a way you\u2019re the one that dropped the ball you should\u2019ve told him yeah I\u2019m gonna do this but we\u2019re gonna sit down and plan one with just the two of you. Dad can watch the others. I think you just forgot you had four kids not just two to worry about", "And clearly their parents are working on that. You can't blame the kids and not the parents for this one.", "Taking just the two out for a special outing is not the same as taking them all out for an outing. That\u2019s the point with all of this.\n\nI guess they have problems with all of the situation but you seem to forget that you have four kids not just two.\n\nTaking all the kids out isn\u2019t fair when you take only the two kids on a trip. I can understand Where they feel like they come in second with this. You can make this better by planning a trip with just the two of them but it doesn\u2019t sound like you really want to do that. It\u2019s all about the other kids. I just hope dad realizes this and does a special trip with them since you don\u2019t seem to want to. I have a feeling that this has been the bios kids all their lives I can see where they would be upset. Hope dad realizes this and does the right thing.", "I find it unbelievable you think you don\u2019t have to explain what\u2019s going on to your younger kids too (obviously in age appropriate terms). It has completely changed their relationship to you and your family dynamics so it\u2019s no wonder they feel upset and left out. You are not providing them with the tools to understand.", "Tit for tat?", "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been a problem for the girls or disrupting their lives, but they KNOW something\u2019s up. A few days ago, at dinner, one of the girls casually mentioned their father and Michael burst into tears. So they know something\u2019s up but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s big on their minds. They\u2019re kids, they don\u2019t get why S and M would be so upset. I mean, I can hardly tell them their siblings\u2019 father was a mean drunk who abandoned them after their mother\u2019s death without a second thought.", "My husband and I explained a bit of it to them (ie their bio dad wants to be a dad now and S and M don\u2019t know what to do) but they kept asking questions that were more and more complex. I told them they\u2019d understand when they were older, so they asked Sophie first, but she flipped at them (I made sure she apologized to them) and Michael started crying.", "I've only heard Tik for Tak, but yours is funny", "Well you don\u2019t have to word it that way, they should know that the dad had some issues and couldn\u2019t take care of them and you stepped in to make sure they had a good life.\n\nThat would be an awful thing to say to the kids you don\u2019t seem to have much closeness to your younger two. You seem to be more concerned about the older ones. This is something that the older ones are gonna have to deal with probably all their life and you need to be there for them.\n\nBut you abandon your other two children because they are going through this isn\u2019t right. The younger two should be involved in this they could provide empathy and if they know what\u2019s going on and that the older two are afraid they\u2019re gonna be taken away they should be part of this to help the other to get through this.\n\nThis is gonna go on for a long time so are you gonna just ignore your younger two to take care of the older two? They need the support of all of you. Why you denying to involve the younger two in this is pushing them further away. They might\u2019ve been more understanding if they knew what was going on. But again it\u2019s all going to be in how you approach it.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re angry with their bio dad and I get that I would be furious. However, maybe they need to be in therapy to help deal with this but this is a family problem and by the younger to not being involved and just seeing that what they Want doesn\u2019t matter and all that matters is the older two has got to be hard on the kids.", "You absoloutley CAN tell them that. And youre making things worse by not doing that. they are 9 and 11, they are old enough to understand that that's a horrible thing to happen.  \n\nAlso your family needs therapy.
