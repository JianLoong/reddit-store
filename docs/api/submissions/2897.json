Your child is both of yours;  not just yours.  It doesn't seem correct that you get to make a decision that the child will be vegetarian.  That should be a joint decision.", "Yep.

Which will be very easy to do since he makes the money. \n\nYou are allowed to have your beliefs for you and your body. But if you start forcing them on your partner don\u2019t be surprised if everything goes downhill.\n\nCongrats on making the change for yourself. Did it years ago and I have never felt better!", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re the SAHP and you cook most of the meals.  That is the set up that you and your husband have agreed to.\n\nSuddenly telling him he needs to cook his own meals or go vegetarian is not reasonable.  You\u2019re either passing off a duty that you used to do (cooking his meals) onto him, without any discussion, or making him become vegetarian with you.\n\nAnd your daughter has two parents - *both* of you should have a say in the diet and mentality she is raised on.", "YTA, and raising your daughter vegetarian a) isn\u2019t your decision alone to make and b) is entirely unfair to your daughter.\n\nWhat if your husband says \u201cI make all the money, don\u2019t buy any food I don\u2019t approve of\u201d do you think he would be an asshole in that situation?", "YTA because you and your husband have decided on a division of labor which includes your staying home and performing the normal acts of a stay at home spouse - regardless of gender. And typically this includes shopping for groceries and preparing the evening meal.\n\nA reasonable compromise would be for you to prepare meat based protein that is easy to prepare in a single serving - i.e a piece of fish; chicken cutlet; steak, lamb chops. Or even prepare a larger amount of animal protein type of food that is easy to freeze and heat up in an individual portion like a stew, braised meat, pot roast, meatballs etc.\n\nYou don't have to do this for every meal as many people who aren't complete vegetarians will eat plant based meals. You aren't a vegan so there are many cheese based foods like lasagna and ziti and many Mexican recipes are cheese with the protein source being beans and/or corn. There are many delicious ways to prepare tofu that would satisfy a meat eater - all kinds of recipes if you start getting imaginative.", "YTA For inflicting your choices on an unwilling partner.

You and your husband agreed to a division of labor where he brings in the money and you take care of home and hearth. Implied in that division is that you are not only going to cook the meals, but cook the same sorts of meals that the two of you enjoyed before you became a stay\u2013at\u2013home parent. \n\nIf you don't want to eat animals, that's on you.

I am on a plant base diet, for health reasons. I stay at home due to health reason, my husband works outside the home. I start dinner and cook my husband his meat.  This isn\u2019t really hard.

This what you are doing, so either get a job, so that the distribution of house work is distributed evenly and you can stick to your new morals.", "YTA.  So you stopped cooking me cause you decided to. Your husband should stop paying for groceries then. If he can cook, you can work", "YTA. You don't get to make unilateral decisions about the kid's diet, regardless of how labor is divided.

If you wanted vegetables you could get a job and buy your own (like how he can just cook his own meat according to you). Would that seem fair to you? For him to make a lifestyle change and to force it on you? That is what you are doing to him.\n\nGo ahead and give up eating meat yourself if that is what you wish. That means your household will consume less meat which will have the effect you are looking for. Don't try to force him into it.", "NTA but you're not going to get any fair answers from the cult of meat of the internet.\n\nIn LITERALLY any other post, Redditors will support their Sistas when they draw boundaries and negotiate with their partners, e.g. how they cook and clean and split money, etc. I don't see how you situation is any difference except for your trying not to kill innocent animals.\n\nEven worse is I've seen at least 3 posts today where the same Redditors complaint and judge people fort mistreating animals and keeping them in cages when they're pets.

If he wants meat he can make it himself, and then I\u2019ll separate out food for me from what I cook and he can add the meat to the rest. The difference in our case is that 1. I told him that is the deal from the start, but more importantly, 2. we both have full-time jobs.\nYou took on the SAH role, which includes cooking. I\u2019m sympathetic because I know I don\u2019t want to cook it either, but I\u2019m not trying to change the rules after the fact.

Why not serve meat from ethical sources?", "NTA He's not going to become sick because of not eating less meat, quite the opposite. He's not allergic to vegetarian food.

Also I was raised vegan, it\u2019s not a big deal.", "YTA - Massive inconvenience? Cooking/Baking meat is like adding a side dish or you can cook in bulk and it is in the frig for a few days.

He is capable to cook it himself", "It\u2019s a complicated question. NAH.\n\nIf there\u2019s an expectation that you\u2019re the one in charge for all the meals and has always been and now, you don\u2019t cook any meat home, that means that you becoming vegan actually affects his diet. In the end, you are indeed forcing him to eat less meat by making it harder for him to get. It\u2019s either meatless or he has to do his own cooking, basically.\n\nIf the role were reversed and you were the one wanting to keep eating meat and he was going vegan and claiming he didn\u2019t want to force his choice upon you but definitely wasn\u2019t eating meat anymore, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d cook veggies and meat for each meal and let each other have what they want. Or if you could cook meals that always have blended meat inside and tell him to cook himself meat free veggies if he wanted, which is the equivalent of what you\u2019re doing now.\n\nSee the thing is, you\u2019re the one cooking, so you have the power to push more for one lifestyle over the other.

So be conscious of that.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re an asshole for doing so, I get that some beliefs are strong and you don\u2019t want to be involved with the meat problem anymore.

Many people who do so, do not do so correctly and this can be extremely detrimental to a child's developing body and brain. Small children have complex nutritional needs and while it is possible for their nutrition to be met with a plant based diet you must ensure they are getting adequate nutrition particularly protein, iron, b12 and other nutrients most easily gotten through animal based food. That takes a lot of planning and coordination, and frankly if just cooking your husband a piece of chicken breast to go along with your plant based dinner is too inconvenient for you, how are you going to handle the inconvenience of managing a small child's complex dietary needs. Or it it just that you don't really care much about your husband so fuck him right, let's cook his own darn meat. You don't come across as a very caring wife. And maybe that's because he is a very caring husband, but we are not judging him today, we are judging you and I definitely think you are an asshole", "yta. quit forcing your beliefs on other.", "YTA. Pushing your newly chosen lifestyle on your husband is very self- righteous. I suggest you also research meat consumption and children. Meat is essential for brain development.

Why is everyone so precious with their meat btw? What it it was another dietary preference, like whipped cream? Surely no one would call you an asshole for not cooking with whipped cream even though your SO likes it.

There are quite a few horror stories of parents who had their children taken from them because they were malnourished, due to a vegan diet. It is incredibly unhealthy, despite your good intentions. \n\nThere are plenty of ways to have a positive impact on the environment, and consuming meat isn\u2019t the crime it\u2019s made out to be. I highly recommend reading Sacred Cow by Diana Rodgers. \n\nI say NTA for wanting to do this for yourself, as I understand where you are coming from. But your husband is NTA either. I do not think you should force this on your husband and child, and if you do then YTA. I work 50-70 hours a week, and am also responsible for cooking meals for my husband and child. My husband wanted to try the AIP diet. I accommodated that for months, and just cooked different dishes for him for every meal. I did this because I cared about his health and preferences, and we are a team. Which is how things like this should be viewed in a marriage.", "Ehhh, hard to call either of you the asshole here.\n\nBut I'm erring on the side that your husband has too much of his identity wrapped up in eating meat.\n\nHe absolutely can and should cook meat to add to his meals. 1) He clearly doesn't know how to cook and should start. 2) While you shouldn't force your diet on him, that means he shouldn't force his on you - he wants steak, he cooks steak.\n\nPerhaps you can share some resources with your husband about how the diet helps the environment. He probably doesn't understand it - and if he does but doesn't care, well, that's a pretty big philosophical difference to have while raising a child, imo. \n\nAlso his stance on you \"forcing the lifestyle\" on your daughter is weird, too. She's 5 months old. She doesn't *have* a choice of lifestyle right now, nor will she for years. For better or worse, her lifestyle is whatever you two make it. Being vegetarian certainly isn't the worst you could do. As long as she's getting the nutrition she needs to grow and be healthy, who cares? And you aren't forcing her to be vegetarian, she can eat meat at school.\n\nIt does bring a good question, though. What happens if, when your daughter grows up, she *doesn't* want to be veggie? What then?", "YTA-  you can\u2019t force something onto him.  Also if your agreement is to cook since you are a SAHM then you should cook him a little meat with the other dishes you cook.

Cook him meat some days a week and let him decide whether he wants to eat the veggie meals on the other days or cook some himself. If you really don\u2019t want to cook any meat at all, then stand your ground but it may come across as forcing him as he has said although I don\u2019t particularly agree as he is a grown man and can cook for himself.\n\nAlso I can kind of understand what he means when he says it\u2019s like forcing your daughter to be veggie as she\u2019s only five months old, she\u2019s not going to have the option of agency when it comes to what she eats right now.

What is in dispute is that she changed the terms of her duties and that directly affects her husband. Yes, her husband can cook meat, but she suddenly says she won\u2019t do that and now her husband has to change his days around to get what he was getting before. She did this completely wrong and she was sneaky by framing it as an \u201cethics\u201d issue when it really comes down to her not holding up her end of their agreement.", "What cultures are those?", "I am she. 34 years old, born and raised veggie. No health conditions, anaemia, mineral deficiencies or any other guff people have told me are in my future. It is in fact possible to raise a perfectly healthy human without meat *surpised pikachu*\n\nEdit- autocorrect", "for sure, i left \"something extra\" deliberately open.  it could be a job, it could be a task he hates, it could be taking the kids to the mall/park for  X hours for true alone time", "Missed the entire point. OP thinks it's unethical to cook meat. Let's say she changed her religion and won't eat pork anymore but her husband loves bacon and they had an agreement where they would have bacon rolls every morning. Would you still have the same opinion? It's ridiculous to force anyone to go against their beliefs and this is one of the very few circumstances where prior arrangements can be changed so both people are still comfortable. Besides, OP is still cooking for him, it's just that there is no meat in it.", "And that's absolutely fine . But if the division of labour was that she cooks the meals ( so in our house I'm meals he's dishes ) , if I stopped cooking food he wants to eat , I should absolutely be picking up another job , he shouldn't have to do all the dishes ( his job ) and I only cook for me and the choice I have made for our children without consulting him  ( household cooking was my job ) \n\nOP is not saying she thinks she's picking up too much labour in the house - that would be a different conversation . She's saying she's decided for everyone a major lifestyle change ,and forcing more labour on him \n\nIf he turned around tomorrow and said - morally I've decided that there corporate world takes too much out of me , im going part time , so you will need to go back to work , you wouldn't be ok with that.", "She hasn't mentioned any of that though , has she . She's basically said he's lucky she cooks the meals ( which is her part of the division of labour ) and he's just to suck it up and also she's made a major life choice for their child's well being without discussion.  She doesn't get to force her moral stance on everyone and then just go ...I'm not doing my agreed part of the workload anymore", "She isn\u2019t ethically against eating meat though. It isn\u2019t an \u201canimals can suffer\u201d take. It is a \u201cI\u2019m anxious about the environment\u201d take. The former might have good ground to argue. The latter, not so much given he will eat the meat regardless so the impact to the environment is the same.", "Support would require a discussion, a step she is not taking with her husband. Your glossing over that fact does indeed make you part of the problem.", "Do you support marriages where spouses care and are compassionate with each other, where they care about their wants, their needs, their emotional well being? How about marriages that allow for conversations instead of ultimatums? And marriages that use joint decision making, where do you stand on that? Because OP has stomped all over those parts of her marriage.", "That is a joke response. She came here asking, not as a willingness to renegotiate, but hopeful for affirmation that she wouldn\u2019t have to do so! This whole question was an exercise in her bad faith. OP is the asshole. YTA.", "Right. She negotiates. But doing what she\u2019s doing now and just stopping without a discussion is wrong on her end.", "How would you feel about a Muslim in a government job refusing to serve women without headscarves because it\u2019s against their values.", "Cooking *for the family* is not the same as cooking for her and dad can just deal with it. For the family takes into consideration what everyone likes and doesn't like.\n\nIf dad discovered companies are shitty and mental health is important and those are now his values, and decides to cut his hours to 50% income is gonna drop. But by your logic he's still fulfilling their agreement and doing his share since he's providing an income. So that's okay right?", "That agreement was made while they were both still eating meat and it was understood that meat would be on the menu. She\u2019s changing the terms of the agreement which is wrong.", "Okay- with that logic Dad can 100% dictate what every penny is spent on. What she is allowed and isn't allowed to buy. She can no longer spend a dime without his approval and if she doesn't like what daddy buys she can go work for herself or go homeless and broke.\n\n  \nOh wait.... maybe that idea is a little flawed ya think?", "Ya so since dad makes 100% income he gets to decide what she spend money on, the clothes she buys, and the food she buys. So since it\u2019s him making the income he should jsut say they are not allowed to buy anything BUT meat and the mom will just have to accept it or stop spending his money.", "A notable example are Indians. I believe something like 40% of the population is vegetarian. Other religious sects (some Buddhist sects come to mind) are also vegetarian.", "I don\u2019t see the husband being especially compassionate either. She\u2019s got a sincere ethical position; all I see is him being a big whiny baby about not getting the exact foods he wants.", "I\u2019m not an asshole for disagreeing with you. Rude.", "Yeah, that\u2019s different. The OP is not in paid employment. She\u2019s in a relationship between two equals, and her husband should support her moral stance. It\u2019s more like if the OP became an Orthodox Jew and the husband were insisting she cook on the sabbath. I\u2019d say NTA there too.", "Maybe 50%? Cooking is like half of taking care of a house and a baby. Maybe a third", "Becoming a vegetarian as an adult is not the same as being raised as a vegetarian from childhood.\n\nAlso, not quite correct about India - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43581122.amp", "And the devolution from actual arguments to ad-hominem attacks on the character of the husband is complete. Vegetarian Debate 101.", "Ok. Disposable diapers are terrible for the environment . If OPs husband took a moral stance that from now on baby was only using reusable diapers , causing extra work on OP , by your argument she would have to adhere by that because it's his moral stance. I assume you are also on board with that ?", "You don't get it.\n\nIt's enforcing your values on others.\n\nI think everybody should be vegetarian. If nothing else at least restaurants would have more decent vegetarian offerings.\n\nBut enforced vegetarianism is fascism.", "Okay? The article you sent said 23-37% of the population. The upper limit isn\u2019t far off from my \u201csomething like 40%\u201d statement. Way to nitpick. \n\nIt\u2019s fine raising a child vegan or vegetarian so long as they\u2019re meeting their needs and they\u2019re properly monitored with periodic health screenings: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2912628/.", "If he does all the diapering, he gets to choose the diapers. \n\nJust like she does all the cooking, she gets to choose what she cooks.", "Agreed! Forcing any kind of moral value on anyone is fascism.", "It\u2019s not enforced. The husband has two hands, a stove, and a credit card. He can eat whatever meat he wants.", "Did you not keep reading where it says that number is drastically overinflated and at most the number of vegetarians in India is 20% and most aren\u2019t raised vegetarian because it is extremely expensive?\n\nAnd Yes any reasonable diet should be qualified with having properly monitored health screenings. What about letting the kid eat food that they enjoy eating?", "So if he does all the money making does he get to choose where his money goes?", "Ok , then by that theory he earns all the money , he gets to choose what it's spent on", "You have missed the point completely and at this point, it\u2019s not even worth trying to explain to you.", "And what makes you say a kid can\u2019t enjoy a vegetarian diet? Lol. Your ignorance of a veg lifestyle is laughable. Did you know there\u2019s vegan chicken nuggets, meatloaf, burgers, and hotdogs? Because that\u2019s probably what you think is \u201cenjoyable\u201d right? You probably think vegetarian kids are restricted to asparagus and brussel sprouts which just isn\u2019t true. \n\nIf my kid ever says they want to eat meat, I\u2019m not going to stop them. I\u2019m just taking them to a local slaughterhouse first so they know that dino-nuggets don\u2019t come from a box. I hate that I grew up in ignorance so my kids won\u2019t. If they still want to eat meat after knowing the slaughtering process, that\u2019s their prerogative."]}
