Your child is both of yours;  not just yours.  It doesn't seem correct that you get to make a decision that the child will be vegetarian.  That should be a joint decision.", "Yep.

But if you start forcing them on your partner don\u2019t be surprised if everything goes downhill.\n\nCongrats on making the change for yourself. Did it years ago and I have never felt better!", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re the SAHP and you cook most of the meals.  That is the set up that you and your husband have agreed to.\n\nSuddenly telling him he needs to cook his own meals or go vegetarian is not reasonable.  You\u2019re either passing off a duty that you used to do (cooking his meals) onto him, without any discussion, or making him become vegetarian with you.\n\nAnd your daughter has two parents - *both* of you should have a say in the diet and mentality she is raised on.", "YTA, and raising your daughter vegetarian a) isn\u2019t your decision alone to make and b) is entirely unfair to your daughter.\n\nWhat if your husband says \u201cI make all the money, don\u2019t buy any food I don\u2019t approve of\u201d do you think he would be an asshole in that situation?", "YTA because you and your husband have decided on a division of labor which includes your staying home and performing the normal acts of a stay at home spouse - regardless of gender. And typically this includes shopping for groceries and preparing the evening meal.\n\nA reasonable compromise would be for you to prepare meat based protein that is easy to prepare in a single serving - i.e a piece of fish; chicken cutlet; steak, lamb chops. Or even prepare a larger amount of animal protein type of food that is easy to freeze and heat up in an individual portion like a stew, braised meat, pot roast, meatballs etc.\n\nYou don't have to do this for every meal as many people who aren't complete vegetarians will eat plant based meals. You aren't a vegan so there are many cheese based foods like lasagna and ziti and many Mexican recipes are cheese with the protein source being beans and/or corn. There are many delicious ways to prepare tofu that would satisfy a meat eater - all kinds of recipes if you start getting imaginative.", "YTA For inflicting your choices on an unwilling partner.

You and your husband agreed to a division of labor where he brings in the money and you take care of home and hearth. Implied in that division is that you are not only going to cook the meals, but cook the same sorts of meals that the two of you enjoyed before you became a stay\u2013at\u2013home parent. \n\nIf you don't want to eat animals, that's on you.

I am on a plant base diet, for health reasons. I stay at home due to health reason, my husband works outside the home. I start dinner and cook my husband his meat.  This isn\u2019t really hard.

So you stopped cooking me cause you decided to. Your husband should stop paying for groceries then. If he can cook, you can work", "YTA. You don't get to make unilateral decisions about the kid's diet, regardless of how labor is divided.

For him to make a lifestyle change and to force it on you? That is what you are doing to him.\n\nGo ahead and give up eating meat yourself if that is what you wish. That means your household will consume less meat which will have the effect you are looking for.

If he wants meat he can make it himself, and then I\u2019ll separate out food for me from what I cook and he can add the meat to the rest. The difference in our case is that 1. I told him that is the deal from the start, but more importantly, 2. we both have full-time jobs.\nYou took on the SAH role, which includes cooking.

Why not serve meat from ethical sources?", "NTA He's not going to become sick because of not eating less meat, quite the opposite. He's not allergic to vegetarian food. He can still buy meat himself and eat anything he wants. \n\nYou're also not his maid.", "YTA\u2026\n\nVegans/Vegetarians ALWAYS expect others to change their diet for them. \n\nPlease don\u2019t follow that trend, smh.

Also I was raised vegan, it\u2019s not a big deal.", "YTA - Massive inconvenience? Cooking/Baking meat is like adding a side dish or you can cook in bulk and it is in the frig for a few days.

He is capable to cook it himself", "It\u2019s a complicated question. NAH.\n\nIf there\u2019s an expectation that you\u2019re the one in charge for all the meals and has always been and now, you don\u2019t cook any meat home, that means that you becoming vegan actually affects his diet. In the end, you are indeed forcing him to eat less meat by making it harder for him to get. It\u2019s either meatless or he has to do his own cooking, basically.\n\nIf the role were reversed and you were the one wanting to keep eating meat and he was going vegan and claiming he didn\u2019t want to force his choice upon you but definitely wasn\u2019t eating meat anymore, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d cook veggies and meat for each meal and let each other have what they want. Or if you could cook meals that always have blended meat inside and tell him to cook himself meat free veggies if he wanted, which is the equivalent of what you\u2019re doing now.\n\nSee the thing is, you\u2019re the one cooking, so you have the power to push more for one lifestyle over the other.

So be conscious of that.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re an asshole for doing so, I get that some beliefs are strong and you don\u2019t want to be involved with the meat problem anymore.

Many people who do so, do not do so correctly and this can be extremely detrimental to a child's developing body and brain. Small children have complex nutritional needs and while it is possible for their nutrition to be met with a plant based diet you must ensure they are getting adequate nutrition particularly protein, iron, b12 and other nutrients most easily gotten through animal based food. That takes a lot of planning and coordination, and frankly if just cooking your husband a piece of chicken breast to go along with your plant based dinner is too inconvenient for you, how are you going to handle the inconvenience of managing a small child's complex dietary needs. Or it it just that you don't really care much about your husband so fuck him right, let's cook his own darn meat. You don't come across as a very caring wife. And maybe that's because he is a very caring husband, but we are not judging him today, we are judging you and I definitely think you are an asshole", "yta. quit forcing your beliefs on other.", "YTA. Pushing your newly chosen lifestyle on your husband is very self- righteous. I suggest you also research meat consumption and children. Meat is essential for brain development.

Why is everyone so precious with their meat btw? What it it was another dietary preference, like whipped cream? Surely no one would call you an asshole for not cooking with whipped cream even though your SO likes it.

There are quite a few horror stories of parents who had their children taken from them because they were malnourished, due to a vegan diet. It is incredibly unhealthy, despite your good intentions. \n\nThere are plenty of ways to have a positive impact on the environment, and consuming meat isn\u2019t the crime it\u2019s made out to be. I highly recommend reading Sacred Cow by Diana Rodgers. \n\nI say NTA for wanting to do this for yourself, as I understand where you are coming from. But your husband is NTA either. I do not think you should force this on your husband and child, and if you do then YTA. I work 50-70 hours a week, and am also responsible for cooking meals for my husband and child. My husband wanted to try the AIP diet. I accommodated that for months, and just cooked different dishes for him for every meal. I did this because I cared about his health and preferences, and we are a team. Which is how things like this should be viewed in a marriage.", "Ehhh, hard to call either of you the asshole here.\n\nBut I'm erring on the side that your husband has too much of his identity wrapped up in eating meat.\n\nHe absolutely can and should cook meat to add to his meals. 1) He clearly doesn't know how to cook and should start. 2) While you shouldn't force your diet on him, that means he shouldn't force his on you - he wants steak, he cooks steak.\n\nPerhaps you can share some resources with your husband about how the diet helps the environment. He probably doesn't understand it - and if he does but doesn't care, well, that's a pretty big philosophical difference to have while raising a child, imo. \n\nAlso his stance on you \"forcing the lifestyle\" on your daughter is weird, too. She's 5 months old. She doesn't *have* a choice of lifestyle right now, nor will she for years. For better or worse, her lifestyle is whatever you two make it. Being vegetarian certainly isn't the worst you could do. As long as she's getting the nutrition she needs to grow and be healthy, who cares? And you aren't forcing her to be vegetarian, she can eat meat at school.\n\nIt does bring a good question, though. What happens if, when your daughter grows up, she *doesn't* want to be veggie? What then?", "YTA-  you can\u2019t force something onto him.  Also if your agreement is to cook since you are a SAHM then you should cook him a little meat with the other dishes you cook.

Cook him meat some days a week and let him decide whether he wants to eat the veggie meals on the other days or cook some himself. If you really don\u2019t want to cook any meat at all, then stand your ground but it may come across as forcing him as he has said although I don\u2019t particularly agree as he is a grown man and can cook for himself.\n\nAlso I can kind of understand what he means when he says it\u2019s like forcing your daughter to be veggie as she\u2019s only five months old, she\u2019s not going to have the option of agency when it comes to what she eats right now.

But, I can inform you that I'm lactose intolerant, or I dislike the taste of mushrooms or I'm against eating pork or whatever, and I generally think the one cooking should include that in their decision making when making the food.\r  \n\r  \nHe doesn't have a problem with all the ingredients she's including, which would be the significant difference between what it would be like if the roles were reversed, and he was making meat for a vegetarian.\r  \n\r  \nThis would be like if the husband was a vegetarian, and the wife always made vegetarian foods, but then at some point she was like \"Welp, i wanna try this new gluten-free diet\"-- as long as she's providing good quality delicious dishes that cover all the nutrients n shit, I wouldn't have any complaint. I might think its silly, but I get food, it tastes good, im not hungry, I'm satisfied.\r  \n\r  \nNow obviously as a team, you should communicate together if he feels like the vegetarian dishes doesn't taste that good, and you can find a compromise by trying a bunch of vegetarian dishes together that you both like, and you can be nice n pick from the set of dishes that he also enjoys, particularly when its a decently big change in diet-- but thats as far as I'd go :b\n\nAlso, regarding your child, I don't think thats important. You're \"indoctrinating\" your child into either direction regardless of what u do, meat-eating, vegetarianism-- the child should just eat what the parents eat, and generally, i think its okay for parents to instill the values they have and believe in, into their child. That is your right as parents, even if I personally disagree with them.", "NTA", "YTA. Wow. The amount of virtue signaling in this post is crazy.

Her child can eat meat when she\u2019s old enough to choose  that, until then I guess all parents \u201cforce their lifestyle on their child\u201d.", "LMAO", "Caring about the environment is an ethical take too, I\u2019m surprised you think it\u2019s not. And she can\u2019t control his actions\u2014 the only thing she can control is her own.", "And what if her husband decides that this is unacceptable and just spends tons more money on take out nightly? Clearly, there should've been a discussion instead of unilateral decisions made.", "by that rationale he could say that he is going top paying for X, make X whatever you want it to be.   I won't pay for haircuts because you don't really *need* haircuts.  If you want haircuts get a part time job to pay for them.   At 5 their child is probably in school at least part time.  \n\nRidiculous, right?  We would all call him the asshole for refusing to pay for something on the basis that he is the one earning the money.   Her making a unilateral decision about what he needs or doesn't need to eat because she's the one cooking is the same thing.", "His needs aren't more important, but they are important enough that OP doesn't get to unilaterally decide every single meal and how the daughter is to be raised. It's just like if the husband insisted on 100% financial control because he's the bread winner. Marriage is supposed to be an equal partnership and she's not holding up her end. If he wants meat with some meals, she should be able to do that for him", "I asked the question if she is cooking when he gets home, or done cooking.  If that's the case OP is TA.  If he is cooking his meat right along side the veggies and they are still done at the same-ish time, then not as big of an AH.\n\nHer calling it a massive inconvenience is a bit off putting though. I don't understand how it would be an inconvenience as she's already cooking.\n\nI will also say cooking side by side with their current dynamic will also probably lead to arguments.  They'd be getting in each other's way.", "Issue seems on the division of the work. He works, she's a SAHM and it seems cooking is her responsibility as part of that division of work, so why does he get zero day in what he gets to eat that she cooks?", "His needs are not necessarily coming before hers. She can do her veggie lifestyle and just pan sear a pork chop for him. YTA It\u2019s not even a change for workload. She used to cook meat and now she will just cook less meat. He is not changing her work load.", "No, she is making a demand. There is zero real compromise when meat is cooked Into meals", "Yes seriously. How healthy it would be is not the point. If at that just get a divorce, they should get one now", "A pure meat diet does not cause constipation.", "Right. It\u2019s nauseating to see the normalization of meat-eating so much so that even asking a QUESTION (OP didn\u2019t even state an opinion) would illicit such strong negative responses.", "Haha! How dare I exist! \ud83d\ude02", "exactly, it\u2019s crazy the amount of downvotes you guys are getting . You can 100% be healthy and normal with a vegetarian diet, as long as you have proper sources of protein and nutrition. Idk why everyone here is so dead set on the fact you need meat to survive , when you really don\u2019t.", "Alright, lets flip this.\nSay the SAHP likes meat, the working parent wants to be vegetarian.\nNow the SAHP cooks meals with meat and tells their partner If they don't like it, they can set aside something before adding the meat so vegetarian partner can add whatever they like (lets say in a Lasagne or similar dish).\nWould that be okay for you? \n\nSpoiler: I don't think it would be.", "I didn't mean it that way and just realised that it does come across the way you understood it.", "So just ignoring the whole there is two parents that should be a joint decision thing ?", "5 months... Definitely not in school and requiring around the clock care. \n\nHowever, if she is the one cooking all the meals, it's in her right to whatever she wants to cook. My bf and I were vegetarians. He decided to eat meat again. He goes out of his way to make sure I never have to cook the meat. He had chicken defrosting on the table when I went to sit down and he jumped up to move it so I wouldn't be sitting next to it. I don't care about it at all, but he respects my decision and is fully competent to cook for himself.\n\nThis guy is more than capable of cooking up a few chicken pieces on sunday and storing them in the fridge to add to whatever food she makes. And pulling the 'well he works all day' is bullshit because he comes home and has a break from his job. She doesn't get to end her work at 5 and clock out.", "She contributed to his earnings by being a SAHM so that\u2019s her money too. What you described is financial abuse. Conversely, he wasn\u2019t involved at all in the cooking.", "Because that isn't actually a fair division of work when you think of it. I feel at this point this will end in divorce. Neither side is going to budge on this. I feel if he really can't live without always eating meat then it's just not going to work. Some meals could easily have meat added to them so he could cook his own. Others can't and if he needs meat that much he can cook for himself. It won't kill him", "I don't think most vegetarians consider cooking meat every meal as part of a veggie lifestyle..", "What is she demanding? She is setting boundaries for her own actions, not placing limits on his.", "No one\u2019s forcing moral values on anyone. She\u2019s not being forced to eat meat. Her husband who works all day wants a piece of meat at dinner. Its OP that is attempting to force her morals on her husband and daughter. So yeah she\u2019s the AH.\n\nETA piggybacking off you cause I agree!!!!", "yes, my mistake on the age.   \n\nhowever, haircuts are still not a necessity, so the rest of my post still stands.   She is more than capable of cutting her own hair.  Just takes a pair of scissors.", "Look, I was a stay at home mom for the duration of my kids growing up years.  I cooked, I cleaned, I was class mom and on the PTA, managed their sports teams, the whole nine yards.   I sometimes cooked things I was not overly fond of because my husband liked those meals and he was out earning the money that enabled me to be a stay at home home.   If we were a two-income family the division of labor might have been different - maybe we take turns cooking and I could tell him, if you want salmon it has to be on the nights you cook.  But he worked full time outside the house and cooking was part of my \"job\" responsibilities.   In my opinion, that did not make it ok for me to say that I was solely responsible for deciding what we would eat.", "The it\u2019s cooking abuse if he doesn\u2019t get what he wants to eat, it\u2019s a two way street.", "You\u2019re right about it not being a fair division of work, but for the wrong reasons. Her cooking should be for all 3 of them, not just her and baby. This would be like hubby only providing financial support for himself and baby but not her. Or to drill down further, her not making him food he wants to eat would be like him not buying stuff (clothes, etc.) stuff she wants. He can live without meat, but she could be warm dressed in all 2nd hand sweats but nothing else, right? If that sounds absurd, it\u2019s because it is. Both partners need to respect each other\u2019s choices. Not be controlling and impose each\u2019s wants on the other, be it with food or finances.", "It's not for us to decide what is fair for them. I also don't see why it wouldn't be fair though.\n\nIf she refuses to cook meat, she should take on some other responsibility that he currently he has to lighten his burden since she's changing the division of work.\n\nSide topic, but it seems she's also made a decision about the child not eating meat in the house without giving him any input, which felt odd but fitting given the OP scenario.", "Except cooking for him is her literal job, as a Sahm.", "Her boundaries equate to de facto limits on his since his time is limited. She\u2019s being an asshole.", "She's still cooking, just not with certain ingredients, she hasn't changed her workload at all.", "That makes no sense. She's still cooking she's just no longer cooking meat.", "She is still cooking though.. he can choose to *add* the meat of he wants", "Her job is being a parent, cleaning house, cooking meals, whatever the hell else they decided. Her role is not personal chef to hubby. She is still cooking meals for her family, as is her responsibility. So what if they arent the meals he prefers?"]}
