That is the set up that you and your husband have agreed to.\n\nSuddenly telling him he needs to cook his own meals or go vegetarian is not reasonable.  You\u2019re either passing off a duty that you used to do (cooking his meals) onto him, without any discussion, or making him become vegetarian with you.\n\nAnd your daughter has two parents - *both* of you should have a say in the diet and mentality she is raised on.", "YTA, and raising your daughter vegetarian a) isn\u2019t your decision alone to make and b) is entirely unfair to your daughter.\n\nWhat if your husband says \u201cI make all the money, don\u2019t buy any food I don\u2019t approve of\u201d do you think he would be an asshole in that situation?", "YTA because you and your husband have decided on a division of labor which includes your staying home and performing the normal acts of a stay at home spouse - regardless of gender. And typically this includes shopping for groceries and preparing the evening meal.\n\nA reasonable compromise would be for you to prepare meat based protein that is easy to prepare in a single serving - i.e a piece of fish; chicken cutlet; steak, lamb chops. Or even prepare a larger amount of animal protein type of food that is easy to freeze and heat up in an individual portion like a stew, braised meat, pot roast, meatballs etc.\n\nYou don't have to do this for every meal as many people who aren't complete vegetarians will eat plant based meals.

Many people who do so, do not do so correctly and this can be extremely detrimental to a child's developing body and brain. Small children have complex nutritional needs and while it is possible for their nutrition to be met with a plant based diet you must ensure they are getting adequate nutrition particularly protein, iron, b12 and other nutrients most easily gotten through animal based food. That takes a lot of planning and coordination, and frankly if just cooking your husband a piece of chicken breast to go along with your plant based dinner is too inconvenient for you, how are you going to handle the inconvenience of managing a small child's complex dietary needs. Or it it just that you don't really care much about your husband so fuck him right, let's cook his own darn meat. You don't come across as a very caring wife.

Why is everyone so precious with their meat btw? What it it was another dietary preference, like whipped cream? Surely no one would call you an asshole for not cooking with whipped cream even though your SO likes it.

There are quite a few horror stories of parents who had their children taken from them because they were malnourished, due to a vegan diet. It is incredibly unhealthy, despite your good intentions. \n\nThere are plenty of ways to have a positive impact on the environment, and consuming meat isn\u2019t the crime it\u2019s made out to be. I highly recommend reading Sacred Cow by Diana Rodgers. \n\nI say NTA for wanting to do this for yourself, as I understand where you are coming from. But your husband is NTA either. I do not think you should force this on your husband and child, and if you do then YTA. I work 50-70 hours a week, and am also responsible for cooking meals for my husband and child. My husband wanted to try the AIP diet. I accommodated that for months, and just cooked different dishes for him for every meal. I did this because I cared about his health and preferences, and we are a team. Which is how things like this should be viewed in a marriage.", "Ehhh, hard to call either of you the asshole here.\n\nBut I'm erring on the side that your husband has too much of his identity wrapped up in eating meat.\n\nHe absolutely can and should cook meat to add to his meals. 1) He clearly doesn't know how to cook and should start. 2) While you shouldn't force your diet on him, that means he shouldn't force his on you - he wants steak, he cooks steak.\n\nPerhaps you can share some resources with your husband about how the diet helps the environment. He probably doesn't understand it - and if he does but doesn't care, well, that's a pretty big philosophical difference to have while raising a child, imo. \n\nAlso his stance on you \"forcing the lifestyle\" on your daughter is weird, too. She's 5 months old. She doesn't *have* a choice of lifestyle right now, nor will she for years. For better or worse, her lifestyle is whatever you two make it. Being vegetarian certainly isn't the worst you could do. As long as she's getting the nutrition she needs to grow and be healthy, who cares?

Cook him meat some days a week and let him decide whether he wants to eat the veggie meals on the other days or cook some himself.

But, I can inform you that I'm lactose intolerant, or I dislike the taste of mushrooms or I'm against eating pork or whatever, and I generally think the one cooking should include that in their decision making when making the food.\r  \n\r  \nHe doesn't have a problem with all the ingredients she's including, which would be the significant difference between what it would be like if the roles were reversed, and he was making meat for a vegetarian.\r  \n\r  \nThis would be like if the husband was a vegetarian, and the wife always made vegetarian foods, but then at some point she was like \"Welp, i wanna try this new gluten-free diet\"-- as long as she's providing good quality delicious dishes that cover all the nutrients n shit, I wouldn't have any complaint. I might think its silly, but I get food, it tastes good, im not hungry, I'm satisfied.\r  \n\r  \nNow obviously as a team, you should communicate together if he feels like the vegetarian dishes doesn't taste that good, and you can find a compromise by trying a bunch of vegetarian dishes together that you both like, and you can be nice n pick from the set of dishes that he also enjoys, particularly when its a decently big change in diet-- but thats as far as I'd go :b\n\nAlso, regarding your child, I don't think thats important. You're \"indoctrinating\" your child into either direction regardless of what u do, meat-eating, vegetarianism-- the child should just eat what the parents eat, and generally, i think its okay for parents to instill the values they have and believe in, into their child. That is your right as parents, even if I personally disagree with them.", "NTA", "YTA. Wow. The amount of virtue signaling in this post is crazy.

Here are some suggestions on what you can do to make this easier on you:\n- Buy a pack of Bubba burgers or something similar and keep them in the freezer. (Bubba burgers can be cooked straight from frozen without needing to be thawed.) Also keep some buns in the freezer and condiments on hand. Bam, now for ~10 minutes of very low-effort cooking you can add a burger to his meal and he can eat whatever vegetarian sides you\u2019re having.\n- Buy chicken in frozen/fresh form, whichever is cheapest. Cook a bunch of it with just salt and pepper and maybe some very light, neutral seasoning, and stick it in the fridge for later. Having cooked, shredded chicken on hand means it can easily be added to most pasta dishes and also things like soups, stews, or certain chilis. You can cook the dish to your liking, separate yours and his, and add the chicken just until it gets warm (like 5 minutes).\n- For a situation where you\u2019re, for example, roasting your protein, you CAN roast meat on the same pan. Make a \u201cboat\u201d out of aluminum foil so the meat juices don\u2019t get on your roasted tofu. Fewer dishes.\n- Canned meat is your friend. It\u2019s pre-cooked and doesn\u2019t need any preparation. You can use it as a topping (like if you\u2019re having a salad and he wants to top his with some meat) or mix it into stuff. \n- You can also do \u201cbuild-your-own\u201d dinners like tacos or fajitas or homemade mini pizzas where everyone just gets to pick their toppings.

I learned how to make like two dishes with chicken because the smell of all other meats have slowly over time started to make me feel sick. I did this so that I can occasionally make dinner for my parents and we can all sit down together to eat (the rarest thing in our house). It makes them happy, so the discomfort of handling a few pieces of meat is okay to me. I handled most if not all of my own meals by the time I was 16.

You *can* source meat from smaller farms that raise their animals in good environments. **It\u2019s not going to hurt the world if you eat meat. It\u2019s all about where you\u2019re getting the meat from.**\n\nKeep in mind for the future that one day you will not ever be able to eat meat. *Your body will reject it.* In very unflattering and possibly embarrassing ways I might add (I\u2019ve thrown up in a parking lot because I *tasted* beef when my burrito order was wrong, didn\u2019t swallow, just tasted). If you follow a fully vegetarian diet (no meat or meat byproducts like gelatin) you will eventually not even be able to eat jello, most yogurts, most gummy brands, marshmallows, starburst, many foods labeled as having \u201cnatural flavors\u201d in them (raspberry is derived from glands in a beaver\u2019s anus, have fun thinking about that next time you eat something blue raspberry flavored)\u2026 your body will freak out and you\u2019ll get sick. A restaurant using the same grill to make meatless and normal food without fully sanitizing in between could even get you sick. Not double checking ingredients on yogurt or candy could make you get sick. **If you push a vegetarian diet on your child this will also happen to her.** I won\u2019t fully tackle that constantly having to check labels could cause your daughter to think that that\u2019s something she needs to do. \n\nThis started happening to me ~6 years after I went completely vegetarian.

By the time your daughter will be in a school where she can get a school lunch, *it will be too late*. **Do not force a vegetarian diet on your daughter.** I\u2019ve listed out some of my most embarrassing \u201cI accidentally ate meat or gelatin\u201d stories. I\u2019m sure there are plenty other people who could list out their own.\n\n**Again if you\u2019re doing this because of environmental impacts of the meat industry you can source meat from less environmentally toxic places.** If you want to be more environmentally conscious you can do so without changing your diet very much at all.

It\u2019s possible to make two servings of meat and reheat the rest as leftovers if you make certain meals. You could do a 3/4 day plan with 3 full vegetarian meals and 4 meals that are vegetarian friendly with meat that can be eaten with them.

You are fulfilling your 'duties' (as far as the way duties seem to be divided in your own relationship and not as in 'it's your duty as a woman' obvs), and if he *needs* to eat meat for every meal, he can use ten minutes of his day to grill his own dead body *(ETA: and eat the same sides you do, only needing to deal with his own protein)*. The key word in people's argument is that he 'expects' meat, but his expectations are not of greater importance than your morals regarding the consumption of animal products.\n\nAlso, re: 'forcing your daughter to be a vegetarian': she's 5 months old and I've never taken care of a baby but I feel like it's a bit early for meat lmao (and, jokes aside, this is even more disingenuous because as you said, you're not going to interfere with her meals outside of home, so if anything, that's 'fairer' than making her eat meat at home; she gets to know what meat tastes like *and* gets introduced to a variety of vegetarian meals. And even if you did raise her as a vegetarian, people are so scandalised by you 'making a choice for her', but isn't that a big part of parenting, making executive decisions? Not for everything obviously, but until she's old enough, she's probably not going to be choosing her own food every day (god knows I would've only eaten ice cream if I had been raised like that lmao).\n\nPeople are so incredibly deeply invested in the idea that eating meat is the norm that they won't even consider that making her eat meat is a choice, just as much as it would be if you chose to raise her as a vegetarian (*which is not even what you're doing!!!)* like, had I been raised as a vegetarian, I could've chosen to eat meat when I was old enough to know what it implied. But I wasn't, and I can't go back and un-eat animals, so. Raising a kid as a meat eater is a lot more of a 'permanent' decision than raising them as a vegetarian.\n\n(Also before people in bad faith try this argument: yes, there absolutely are a variety of reason someone could be unable to be a vegetarian, which could be the case for the child here - I'm not telling anyone to force feed beyond burgers to their child if they don't metabolise animal protein correctly, or any other legit reason someone would be unable to be a vegetarian.)\n\n(Edit: the prepositions in this were atrocious lmao)", "NTA.

I'm sure the last thing he wanted in his life was yet another big change.", "As a meat eating person married to a vegetarian with a very similar division of labor in our house, perhaps my opinion is unpopular but I'm gonna say NTA. It's really not a big deal for me to cook a side of meat and toss it into whatever my partner made. I guess you may be TA if your husband works 16 hour shifts or something like that, but if he's only upset about taking 15 minutes out of his day to make something for himself that's fairly selfish. \n\nLikely NTA.", "NTA you can decide what you want to cook.

She's mostly vegetarian, but will change her mind for bacon, chicken nuggets and the occasional pepperoni pizza) are vegetarian as well.\n\nWhen I cook, I make a meal with meat, usually.  When he cooks, he doesn't.  If I want meat to go with his meal, I will make it myself.  I don't expect my meatless people to cook meat for me.\n\nSo I vote NTA because if meat is that big a deal for him, he can make it himself.", "NTA. your husband sounds like an entitled brat. if he wants meat he can cook it himself", "NTA. It\u2019s amazing how many people slam a SAHM about not working but literally support a fully grown adult not being able to complete basic life skills.  I always wonder what these people would do if they were single and working full time.  Like the guy would have to come home and still feed himself after working a full day.", "I don't really understand why people think not feeding a kid meat is \"forcing a lifestyle\" on them. Giving them meat is also forcing a lifestyle on them? So much of what we do is \"forced\" on our children because they cannot make certain choices on their own.

If you are cooking dinners, and if he specifically wants some deviation from the meal, then he can cook his own meal. You are not his servant. If he doesnt want to eat what you make, you should not have to cook an entirely separate meal. This is like if a child hates what you cook for dinner and you cook an entirely new dinner for that one child, everyone would call you terrible names and belittle your parenting and youre giving into the child blah blah blah but suddenly you say youre a SAHM and you HAVE to cook a separate meal for your husband. please. hes a grown man, he can cook his own meals. SAHM moms are there to care for the child since daycare is expensive, not a reason to treat your wife as a slave to your whims.", "NTA.

NAH, you just need to rediscuss how chores get split up.", "NTA, he does not need (and should not) eat meat for every meal.

You shouldn't have to make two meals on top of taking care of your child, the house and cooking for you and your child just because he refuses to eat less meat. Meat isn't a nessecity or something you should be having on every meal anyways. Also your child eating vegetarian food isn't forcing them any more than cooking them food with meat would be. Kids eat what the parents eat and that's okay and normal as long as they get all of the vitamins and nutrients they need, which isn't affected by whether meat is incorporated in that or not. And since you said your child is getting to eat meat at school etc so that isn't even the case here, your kid will just propably have a larger food palate due to eating more different types of foods", "NTA I disagree with most of this thread. He should do 1 hour of meal prep per week and precook the meat he wants to add to meals if he wants meat. It\u2019s not hard.

It's not like you said you won't cook for him at all if he doesn't stop eating meat. Cutting up a piece of meat and tossing it on a pan takes like 10 minutes so if he wants to eat it so bad, it's not that difficult. Besides eating meat every day is not healthy anyway.", "Exactly. She's not saying I'm not cooking anymore at all. She's saying this won't be part of the menu.\n\nAlso agreeing, SAHM for so many people ends up being a 24/24 job for people that assume it becomes her role to do anything and everything around the house.", "And people are acting like he can\u2019t eat any of the food she cooks. Like?? He can cook meat and add it to what she made? I highly doubt their division of labor agreement everyone is referencing had \u201cmust include meat in dinner\u201d added.

Okay you can make something else yourself. OP's job is providing food and that's exactly what OP did. Demanding OP to make something else just because he doesn't like what's on the table is childish behaviour", "Right??? As long as OP is still making meals (because this is part of their arrangement), I see zero issue with those meals no longer containing meat. A meal is a meal.", "How do most people not get this? My partner doesn\u2019t cook and eats meat. I\u2019ve been a vegetarian for decades and do all the cooking. If my partner wants meat they order some in. It\u2019s not that big of deal.

My mom stayed home but before she gave up her job she sat down with my dad and they mapped out the division of labor. He would work 12+ hour days so she handled us almost exclusively on her own during the week and handled his meals and laundry. He paid for house cleaners to come weekly because she told him she couldn\u2019t handle doing that as well and he agreed it wasn\u2019t fair to put the cleaning on her too. He would handle any maintenance stuff around the house, the outdoor work, etc. and he would primarily watch us on the weekends so she could get some down time. They\u2019ve been together almost forty years because (1) the division of labor was always agreed upon and open for discussion if changed needed to be made, and (2) my dad understood they are a team and has never tried to control the money. He\u2019s always openly said he wouldn\u2019t have gotten very far without her support and if they ever divorced he would hand over half and pay alimony with no complaints because shes an awesome SAHM and would be entitled to all of that. The team mindset is key.

Not to mention, the husband can eat vegetarian! He can eat meat outside of the home, or make his own on the side. He is not entitled to her forced labour in this regard.", "As a vegan myself, if this happened I'd just... make my own food.

I do all the meal planning and most of the grocery shopping but my husband comes home from work, asks what\u2019s for dinner and then cooks whatever I tell him, and then I wash the dishes while he bathes our child.  Also, he eats meat and I do not, and he doesn\u2019t bring meat into our home, or eat it at home, only if he eats out somewhere.  I\u2019m on OPs side in this obviously.

Most children aren't given \"the choice\" to be omnivorous, they just eat what their parents prepare.  They can obviously make a choice when they're older, but feeding children a vegetarian diet is no more or less moral than feeding them an omnivorous one.", "Agreed. This is not a one person is right / one is wrong situation, as few are. I\u2019m repulsed by the many extremely sexist comments on here. Yes, she\u2019s a SAHP but that doesn\u2019t give him more rights than she does. The amount of money being made does not define the amount of work each is doing. Childcare is extremely expensive so she is contributing financially too. Their daughter is only 5 months old so it sounds like she is newly a SAHP. There\u2019s going to be some time needed to adjust their roles to this new situation. They are equal partners here so they need to figure this out together. NAH or else both are if they refuse to compromise.\n\nI have been a vegetarian since childhood. I don\u2019t cook meat for my husband but that has been the understanding all along. I would not be with anyone who would demand that I cook meat for them. And I would never demand someone be vegetarian. We usually have 2 \u201con our own\u201d dinners a week where we each cook what we want. I cook the rest vegetarian. This works for both of us. \n\nWhen we have kids I\u2019m not going to force them to be vegetarian but I\u2019m not going to start cooking meat either. But I may give them pre-prepared meat.

We have to figure out how to grow the different tissue types together, stimulate muscle tissue so it actually becomes muscle, ideally grow the meat without antibiotics, grow it in non-animal based media, and figure out how to mass produce it (again, without antibiotics and animal based media). \n\nIt\u2019s really exciting but frustrating that not many people are making a big enough deal about it!", "Agreed. Especially those darn vegan cat owners. Seriously, why is vegan cat food even a thing?", "> Is their agreement that she cooks meals on his demand? Was part of their deal that dinner needs to have meat?\n\nI don't think it's crazy moon logic to suggest that any such agreement was with the assumption that the meals she would fix would, generally speaking, be ones he would want to eat. \n\nI'm reminded of a post we had here a couple weeks ago, to the effect of \"Am I an asshole because I put mushrooms in almost everything I cook, despite my husband not liking mushrooms?\". The general consensus was, yes, she was.

Even then, we normally just talk about it. If I notice they\u2019ve stopped doing a task that is theirs and it frustrates me, but I\u2019m typically never mad they stopped doing it. Im normally just frustrated that they didn\u2019t communicate that they were going to stop (I have some disability with physical limitations, so I need some heads up so I can shift that task to myself with accommodations made) However, I think what you\u2019re saying is true and depends on the relationship.\n\nIn other relationships I definitely would have felt that way. In my current relationship I don\u2019t. My fianc\u00e9 could decide one day it\u2019s all too much and lay in bed all day indefinitely, and while it would be hard, I would pick up the slack.\n\nTheir value to me is who they are and not what they do. (Not saying that\u2019s better or worse than valuing your partner for BOTH who they are and what they do, it\u2019s just how I feel with this person).I don\u2019t think it\u2019s abnormal or bad to expect effort/a share in responsibilities with your partner. I think the way some of these commenters are framing it though is very unhealthy. It reeks of \u201cI\u2019ll leave my wife if she gets cancer and can\u2019t pull her load because our agreement was her doing xyz\u201d\n\nI also think in the case of OP and the original work: she is still pulling her load. She didn\u2019t stop cooking, she just stopped cooking meat. She\u2019s still doing the same work, just not in the way he\u2019d like. When that happens in my relationship, I just pick up those parts of the task myself. I.e. I have some beautiful Le Cruset Dutch ovens, croquettes, and dishes. My fianc\u00e9 is wayyyyy too rough with how they hand wash them (I don\u2019t want them in the dishwasher) and typically misses bits. Now, I just wash them a second time myself (they did start handling the dishes more gently lol). My fianc\u00e9 hates the way I prefer to have all dirty dishes in the sink. They prefer them spread on the counter with a basin empty, which stresses me out when I do them. So, they primarily do the dishes now and I come in and finish up the parts I\u2019m not picky about. I wouldn\u2019t say their slacking/not doing \u201ctheir work\u201d just because it\u2019s not in the way I prefer. I just do those parts myself\n\nSorry, this is a bit rambly lol", "Because he works, hur-de-hur.\n\nLike that's so hard. Most people have jobs.", "Ovens are also less likely to be contaminated with PFAS", "That is fair! I live north so running the oven is a bonus.  I feel like most of the times I see people raving it\u2019s over recipes that they\u2019ve prob never tried in the their oven.
