I'm a short woman in my early thirties, and today I was working for an hour at a cafe. I was sitting in a very tight corner by the window, at a short coffee table with two small chairs to go with it. I was in one chair, and because I have leg pain I had put a leg up on the other chair, along with my belongings. \n\nI was minding my business working and drinking my coffee, and all of a sudden this man (probably late 50s-early 60s?) comes up and asks if he can sit in the chair where I've put my things. I say no. \n\nThe reasons I say no are:  (1) it's a tiny corner meant either for one person or two people to sit together (who want to) and I don't feel comfortable sharing it with someone I don't know as a single woman by myself. I have anxiety around men whom I don't know; (2) I need to rest my leg; (3) There are other free chairs available in the cafe, and a nice area outside as well where he could sit. Note that it's not obvious to anyone that my leg hurts.\n\nI don't explain this to him, I just politely say no. \n\nHe gets **angry**. He starts shouting, 'You don't get two chairs! Let me sit here! I'm sitting here!' And then he grabs the chair with my stuff (and my leg) on it and starts pulling it out. I pull it back and I respond, 'Please go away sir, I'm minding my own business, you mind yours'. He keeps shouting that I 'shouldn't have two chairs' over and over, and I just keep making eye contact and repeating 'please go away, please go away, stop touching my things, go away'. \n\nHe gives up shouting at me after about five minutes and leaves. The lady across the room stares and kind of gives me this weird small smile, and that's it. He was very angry, and I was shaking.\n\nI'm wondering if I'm the asshole because technically, that chair didn't truly belong to me. I feel kind of bad about it. But I don't think I am because I wasn't preventing him sitting anywhere else, there were other spaces he could go, and I got the sense that he just wanted to push someone around to sit by the window.", "created_utc": 1681396003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kr19g/aita_because_i_wouldnt_let_this_guy_sit_beside_me/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm amazed (and horrified) the people working there let this continue for five minutes.", "NTA. There were other chairs that he could have sat in and you were technically occupying both of the chairs at your table. What he did was unacceptable and the fact that no staff member stepped in to help you would make me steer clear of that coffee shop.\n\nETA...it was pointed out that the staff was busy with a long line. In that case, I would give them the benefit of the doubt.", "NTA - The cafe wasn't overly crowded and there was plenty of seating. Had circumstances been different, ie crowded cafe or no physical/personal challenges- then that would be a different story.  Your physical discomfort may not be noticeable however people make assumptions all the time.  He asked a question and you said \"no\". You have a right to personal space in public and his reaction was absurd.  No need to feel bad, OP.", "NTA. \n\nOther chairs there, and in general public seating is first come first serve.  Yeah you could have explained things, but I get the feeling he still would have flipped out. I don't get why he flipped out - but, it makes me very suspicious of his intentions.", "NTA\n\nThere were other seats available, so not wanting to sit next to someone you don't know, when there are other options for the guy to sit in, is not unreasonable.\n\nIf there were no other empty seats, that would be a different story, but there were other seats, according to what you said.", "NTA. Where I\u2019m from, even if you have one chair at a 4 person table, it would be weird to ask. The only tables that are obviously shared are long ones in the middle of a space. Next time say your boyfriend/girlfriend/friend is meeting you, but running late.", "NTA, grandpas off his meds", "These people are *fascinating*. If there were free seats around you I'm gonna go with NTA. You weren't hurting anyone, why does this guy even care? Sit somewhere else, weirdo. \n\nThis reminds me of an encounter I had which is very similar:\n\nAbout 10 years ago, I (19M at the time) was sat on a bus having just started a 5 hour long journey. It was a late night bus so there were several empty seats available, as in multiple rows had both seats free with free space both in front and behind. I'm above average height so I was taking advantage of the free space by reclining in my seat with my left leg up between the window and the free seat in front of me, living my best life. After a few stops, this 40-something bald guy comes on the bus. He looks around for a seat for a bit, and then... he spots me. Oh boy did he spot me. He kinda freezes up for a bit and just gets this *look* on his face. As if something deep within him was awakened by the sight of me taking up more space than was strictly necessary. This was apparently gravely insulting towards his existence as a person. He confidently walks up to me and tells me to take my leg down because he needs the seat in front of me. I'm taken aback because... For real? Look around dude, wouldn't you rather wanna sit in any of these free seats all around us? But no, the hero of our story was adamant that he needed *this* exact seat. Because of reasons, you see. I, afraid of conflict as I am, reluctantly remove my leg so he could sit down. As I am readjusting, this motherfucker deliberately and forcefully jams his seat back into my legs, making me shout \"Hey hey what the fuck?!\" in confusion. He then whips his head around, looks me deep in the eyes with seething hatred and tells me \"If **YOU** can sit like this, **I** can sit like this!\" I was so flabbergasted by the whole situation. The guy was obviously dealing with some kind of repressed trauma that would take way longer than a bus ride to unravel, so I ended up just moving seats - something which gave our hero *great* satisfaction.\n\nI think some people just get incredibly ticked off when people take up more space than is *necessary*. Even if it doesn't hurt or affect anyone in any discernable way. If you were in a full caf\u00e9 or I was in a full bus, we would obviously be assholes for taking up more space than we needed and hindering others from using that space - but it's just very fascinating to me why these guys feel the need to stand up to the absolute tyrrany of someone stretching their legs when there's plenty of free space around.", "NTA because there were other spots available", "NTA. No, you don't have any 'right' to a second chair whether your leg hurts or not, but any sane stranger just asks if they can take the chair, and politely accepts a refusal. This guy went ballistic and should have been ejected from the cafe.", "If I sit at a table by myself, I sure as shit don\u2019t want a rando sitting down at the table with me.  That\u2019s super weird and awkward.   \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\nThere were other places to sit. \n\nThis reaction to not getting a preferred seat is over the top.", "NTA  This guy was bullying you, so good for you standing up to him.", "NTA - Man had other options ad chose to be a child instead.", "NTA. I\u2019m  sorry that happened, it sounds scary as hell. Nothing justifies a reaction like that", " NTA\nhe could\u2019ve sat in a different seat instead of antagonising you for 5 minutes.If anything he actually sounds a bit creepy", "NTA he probably wanted the window seat.\n\nHowever he is not entitled to it.  \n\nAs others have said he also probably wanted a woman to talk at.  \n\nMen like this are a nuisance.", "NTA I\u2019m shocked an old dude acted wildly entitled and unhinged in public./s\n\nSeriously men need to fuck off and leave women alone in public.", "As long as there were other places to sit, NTA.", "NTA.\n\nConsidering there was other places to sit, and he was I assume alone, it seems like he just didn\u2019t like the fact you had your foot on one of the chairs and wanted to disrupt your peace and comfort.", "NTA - that sounds like a scary situation.    He was the AH.", "NTA since you said that he could have sat anywhere else. I've had this happen to me and said that I was waiting for someone. When they got pushy I pointed them to the other chairs and called the staff for help when they still insisted. Sorry about what happened, I hope you take it up with the staff in case it happens again.", "NTA. There were other places to sit. If you're in the US it's not normal to join others.", "I spend a lot of time eating out or at cafes solo, and usually travel solo. The unspoken rule is it\u2019s 1000% cool to ask to join someone else sitting alone if there\u2019s limited seating and it\u2019s busy, AS LONG AS you\u2019re 1000% cool with them saying no. NTA", "He grabbed the chair with your stuff and leg on it and tried to forcibly remove it? That sounds like assault. NTA .", "NTA what a complete creep.", "Even if there were no other tables or chairs, no one is entitled to force others to share a table. And no one is entitled to an explanation. \n\nNext time, don't go beyond the first no. Immediately pull out your phone and call the police when anyone wigs out like this. You do not have to put up with any amount of abuse.", "NTA. He sounded entitled.", "YTA for taking up so many chairs.", "YTA for the chair, not for saying you don't want him sitting with you.  You don't get to occupy two chairs in a business.  The chairs are for customers to sit on, not for your stuff or your foot/leg.  You occupying two chairs is bad for the business.  The rest of us don't want to sit down on a dirty chair where your foot has been either.", "YTA, seats are for people not feet and stuff.", "Yta for sitting with your leg on a chair. Other people need to sit on those chairs. You don't need to let strangers sit next to you. But show some manners. People jump up and down about kids being a bit loud or unruly and then you have adults sitting with their feet on chairs.", "ESH\n\nIs this the kind of cafe where people can plug in their laptops and you were sitting by the outlet?\n\nIf he was so weird and belligerent about insisting on that chair, you could have moved. Sure, you shouldn\u2019t have to move from a spot you\u2019re comfortable in and have sat in for a while because of some random guy. But you also didn\u2019t have to escalate the situation. When people get weird like that, why not just remove yourself from the situation completely?\n\nI have an invisible disability that causes severe chronic pain. I have a disabled parking placard, there are days I literally cannot walk, sometimes I use a wheelchair. I STILL would not use two chairs in a cafe the way you\u2019re describing because it\u2019s ridiculously rude.\n\nEditing to add: I am a woman, short in stature, grew up in domestic violence, and have survived more than one sexual assault. I am well aware that men usually have the upper hand in situations where there is a power imbalance and that they can be very dangerous and unpredictable.  When this particular man made it clear he was going to cause problems, it would have been the safer option to just let him have the stupid chair and move to another table.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If there were other chairs open he could've sat somewhere else, I bet at least one of those chairs didn't have belongings or legs on them.\n\nIf something like this were to happen again, something that could help you would be to loudly say back to him \"I don't know you, leave me alone!\" To hopefully get the attention of more people near you that this person is not welcome to invade your space. Especially as a short woman, (me too!) we often look younger than we are and can use that to our advantage to alert others that we might require assistance and some kind person might come to our aid.
