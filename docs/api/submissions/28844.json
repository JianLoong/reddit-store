We're having to rip everything down to its bonework. \n\nMy new neighbours are a bit elusive. I know theres at least a dad and a daughter and the daughter has additional needs. We've been working for three months and she has been having screaming fits every time we work with anything remotely noisy. There is also a son and I know there is at least a mum somewhere but I've never seen her.\n\nRecently we've moved to the bathroom which seems to line up with their daughters bedroom. \n\nNow, the bathroom has been the worst room yet. Literally everything has to go - sink, bath, shower, toilet, windows - even the walls have to go. Its bad.\n\nWe started four days ago. Immediately she started screaming, so loud we could hear her over the tools and through our ear protection. \n\nWhen we continued the next day her dad banged on our door. Explained that she's autistic and we're invading her space - apparently the vibrations through the wall shook something off a shelf and broke. I apologised and he seemed happy with that.\n\nLater that evening he cane back, clearly in from work, and started laying into me and my brother (the one helping me). Called us inconsiderate bastards, left again.\n\nYesterday he was red in the face with rage, asking if we're really that \"heartless\" to keep overwhelming her, . I did catch sight of his daughter and she did look distraught, so I apologised again, but explained that I have to do it. \n\nToday he came knocking, again, and demanded we move on from our drilling. He explained that his daughter hasn't been able to recover from meltdowns, that its been a constant battle for days. He and she are both exhausted. \n\nI apologised, again, but told him it was his job as a father to help her cope and we should not have to hinder our work for a child we don't even know.\n\nHe left, pissed as all hell, and ever since my wife has been giving me the cold shoulder. We're expecting and she's calling me an asshole, saying we would expect the same decency when our baby arrives.\n\nI understand why the dad is annoyed, but I am on a time crunch and my brother and I are basically doing this solo (obviously excluding the hired help for things I'm not well versed in). \n\nWe're continuing on with our work but my wife still isn't talking to be. She called me a dick and I've been delegated to the couch. The neighbours also seemed pretty pissed when we left.\n\nSo, AITA?

I\u2019m confused what he thinks you\u2019re going to do but finish?", "What exactly did your wife expect you to do??? Stop working and leave everything torn down with no walls and plumbing??? Are you supposed to put your lives on hold for a stranger's kid?? \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou are right, it's unfortunate that she is unable to handle being around the work but that doesn't mean you can just stop the project. As her parents it IS their job to help her cope and just letting her scream and not helping her find coping skills that help or removing her from the situation is on them.", "NTA\n\nI really don't know what you're expected to do here. Unless the father somehow expects you to drag this out for literally *months*", "As an autistic person myself, she's being put through the ringer.  Annoying sounds are the absolute worst. I legitimately want to sock the television  sometimes. I refrain because I have learned to cope and they are expensive and you can change the channel.  That said, perhaps it would help to gift them some noise-cancelling headphones or suggest they invest in some . You aren't trying to hurt her. You're just working on your house.  The world is just a different experience for us. Personally sound can be just as beautiful as it is annoying but I imagine even normal folk don't want to hear construction all day.", "NTA, you simply have to finish the work, there is no way around that. But I also het the father's frustration. \n\nMaybe limit the loud noise to a few hours a day and ask them when it's the most convenient, like when she is in daycare/school/therapy/somewhere else?", "NAH. I have ASD myself, and I know that if I had to deal with that kind of noise consistently as a little kid, I probably would have been ballistic a lot of the time. Unfortunately there's not much that can be done when a small child is experiencing sensory overload except to try to remove them from the cause of the noise, and it's hard when it's right next to your home. That said, nobody should realistically expect you to stop mandatory work being done on your home.", "NTA but your neighbor and wife sure are!\n\nNeighbor needs to find a way for his daughter to deal. The world won\u2019t stop for her and he can\u2019t expect it to.\n\nWife is\u2026a piece of work. Super nasty of her to call you an AH over this. And no, you two should NOT expect neighbors to forgo any home renovation projects that involve drilling once your baby comes. Smh how entitled can someone be?\n\nWhat does your wife want you to do? Just live in a shitty place and let your baby live in it too?\n\nAlso the silent treatment is emotional abuse, just saying.", "NTA\n\nHe can't realistically expect that because he has an autistic child, his neighbors are prohibited from doing work o their own properties until he moves out.\n\nHe *should* have already thought to get ear plugs and noise-canceling earphones to go over them. Perhaps make a schedule of when you'll be doing work and give it to them so they can get out of their place while work is going on.", "NTA. You are renovating your house that's going to get noisy, you can't exactly make renovations noise free. Your neighbor was out of line, banging the door, yelling, insulting you, he should have talk to you about his daughter's situation and tried to find a solution like maybe you work in the bathroom at certain hours or certain days while he takes her out, he knows his daughter he should have propose a solution you are not a mind reader. \n\nAnd you're wife is also being unreasonable, what are you supposed to do, leave the bathroom in a crappy condition or leave the work half way done? \n\nThe world won't stop for the girl, you are right her family needs to help her to find ways to cope", "NTA. Maybe you can invite the dad in to show him how much work is left, and coordinate a time that works for both of you when she isn't in the house, or if she stays in the house 24/7 can he get her out of the house while the noise is happening? Quite frankly, this is not your problem. It's his.", "NTA. Sit down with your wife and ask her what she feels would work best?  You can stop working on the house and your family can live in it in the current condition.  You can sell the house and buy something already liveable.  The neighbor can deal with their child for the short term. You will not be working on the house for 10 years.", "Nah. I understand the father's frustration, but what other option do you have? Construction isn't quiet even if you try to drag it out. It has to happen. Maybe try to do it when the daughter is out of the house or arrange with the father for her to leave for a certain amount of time?", "NTA\n\n> Explained that she's autistic and we're invading her space\n\nYeah. Well. \n\nHER screaming fits are invading YOUR space.", "\nNTA. It's a tough spot but you have the right to do work on your property during reasonable hours.", "Info: What sort of hours are you working on things?  \n\nSome noise is unavoidable with shared walls, and you need to be able to do the work, and they'll need to help their daughter through things... but if you've kept her up all day and night for days, that's a big gap in the story.  It seems like you could have told them when to expect the noise after the first time they came over, and it seems odd that never came up.  Most neighborhoods with joined houses especially do have stricter noise laws at night, and you may be breaking them if you are working late due to the rush you mention.  If that's the case, give them some reasonable hours and find non-drilling parts to do at night.  There's probably plenty of that as well anyways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have construction going on and this is the perfect time for her father to help her with additional coping mechanisms.  The world is not going to adjust for her.", "INFO - What times are these things happening? (I'm presuming during the day, in which case, not the AH but just checking it's not at a time that she needs to be in that specific room.)\n\nThere has to be some sort of compromise where there are agreed hours where you can work so her parents know they need to help her out during those times. I appreciate that it is difficult for some autistic people with loud noise but at the same time, it's unfair for them to expect for you never to do any refurbishments.", "YTA\n\nTalk to the dad about how to time the work so she isn't in the bedroom. Or how to get her headphones or such. Ask your wife's advice on how to proceed. \n\nDo something to make things easier. You can ignore her just because you don't know her? What a huge AH."]}
