You're def the AH here.", "NTA\n\nYou are right, it's unfortunate that she is unable to handle being around the work but that doesn't mean you can just stop the project.

I legitimately want to sock the television  sometimes. I refrain because I have learned to cope and they are expensive and you can change the channel.  That said, perhaps it would help to gift them some noise-cancelling headphones or suggest they invest in some . You aren't trying to hurt her. You're just working on your house.

I have ASD myself, and I know that if I had to deal with that kind of noise consistently as a little kid, I probably would have been ballistic a lot of the time. Unfortunately there's not much that can be done when a small child is experiencing sensory overload except to try to remove them from the cause of the noise, and it's hard when it's right next to your home. That said, nobody should realistically expect you to stop mandatory work being done on your home.\n\nEDIT: After some comments cluing me in and seeing the extra info about the hours of noise, OP is ABSOLUTELY the AH.

Just live in a shitty place and let your baby live in it too?\n\nAlso the silent treatment is emotional abuse, just saying.", "NTA\n\nHe can't realistically expect that because he has an autistic child, his neighbors are prohibited from doing work o their own properties until he moves out.\n\nHe *should* have already thought to get ear plugs and noise-canceling earphones to go over them.

You are renovating your house that's going to get noisy, you can't exactly make renovations noise free.

Maybe you can invite the dad in to show him how much work is left, and coordinate a time that works for both of you when she isn't in the house, or if she stays in the house 24/7 can he get her out of the house while the noise is happening? Quite frankly, this is not your problem. It's his.", "NTA. Sit down with your wife and ask her what she feels would work best?  You can stop working on the house and your family can live in it in the current condition.  You can sell the house and buy something already liveable.

It seems like you could have told them when to expect the noise after the first time they came over, and it seems odd that never came up.  Most neighborhoods with joined houses especially do have stricter noise laws at night, and you may be breaking them if you are working late due to the rush you mention.  If that's the case, give them some reasonable hours and find non-drilling parts to do at night.  There's probably plenty of that as well anyways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So construction starting at 6PM and lasting long past a typical kids bedtime, bc quiet hours legally start at 11 PM. And you are doing this for weeks on end.  Instead of hiring help and blasting through sooner, or taking work days off, you save money, but your neighbor suffers greatly. I hope they don\u2019t take pleasure in waking your sleeping baby!", "YTA for not including that you're doing construction from 5pm to 11pm every day. Ofc your wife is mad, imagine having a newborn and trying to put it to sleep at a decent hour only to have loud construction noises outside during bed time.

Many assholes conduct their assholery entirely legally. \n\nI was on your side until you said in a comment that you're doing construction work from 5pm-11pm every night. \n\nIf your house is connected to other houses and there isn't much of any noise insulation, then thats such an asshole move. I'd be raging with you if you were doing construction until 11pm, even without an autistic child in the picture. \n\nYes, you're probably within your rights regarding noise ordinances but that doesn't mean you aren't being an asshole.\n\nWhat you need to be aware of is that by doing this you're destroying any prospect of a good relationship with your neighbours.

Hell, kids or not, I'd be pissed coming home from work to an AH neighbor making that much racket from the time I got home until 11 anyway, rather than hiring professionals that could get the work done during the day & be done at a reasonable time or working on the weekends during the day.   \n The fact that your wife literally isn't talking to you over this also makes it seem like there is more missing info with how you've handled this overall or you've softened how you've spoke to the neighbor in your retelling of the story.", "You\u2019re doing the work between 5pm and 11pm? And it\u2019s been _three months_? YTA. \n\nI\u2019m curious as to what steps you took prior to starting this work, to attempt to maintain or not overly impact the peace and comfort of your neighbours. This block of time is a time for rest, dinner, unwinding and de-stressing. Did you talk to them before you started? Explain the time frame of how long it would take, outline your plan?   \n\nYou say the neighbours are elusive. I wonder how hard you have tried to pin them down. Your post is very, very focused on your needs - and your home being liveable is a valid need - however, your neighbours have needs as well and you seem to feel that\u2019s unfair.   \n\nI\u2019m not convinced you\u2019ve tried to meet them in the middle, given you\u2019re doing this work at this time of day. My suspicion is you\u2019ve had a tiny voice in the back of your mind saying \u2018Well, I _need_ to do this, even though it\u2019s in irregular hours, so everyone just has to suck it up and deal with it for a while.\u2019 Others may not be willing to agree with that when it\u2019s their peace and quiet that\u2019s being sacrificed.  \n\nI\u2019m an autistic adult. Prolonged noise takes an enormous toll on me. My brain perceives noise as pain, the more complex the noise, the more painful it is. Your actions are likely causing this girl a lot of pain and it\u2019s been going on for _months_. She/her family presumably have little idea of what\u2019s happening, when, what time, what noise level to expect, and so on.   \n\nHave you given them any detail? How can they plan? How can they manage to cope with the consequences of your actions, which they have no control over? How can they make the best out of this shitty situation? How have you helped, how have you been neighbourly about this?  \n\nThat you say you shouldnt have to modify your work for \u201ca child you don\u2019t even know\u201d is what really gets my goat. Do you only extend compassion to those you know? Do you not think that someone living next to you will be within that circle of \u2018people I know\u2019 one day?

There are ways they can move her to other parts of the house and provide her w things to redirect, depending on how severe her sensitivity is.\n\nHonestly...that's kind of the job that comes w being the parent of someone w autism. There's a lot of everyday situations that you have to work around in ways you never would've even had to consider otherwise.\n\nI think besides being in contact w the dad and warning him when you're about to use power tools so he can shift her to a different area of the house, use noise canceling headphones (which if this happens w other noises then they should def invest in some) and throw something on the TV that comforts her, there's really not much to be done that doesn't hinder your progress.", "You're doing everything legally and it's not like you're trying to do it on purpose.

The best compromise really is that you at least sit with your neighbour and find out the set times that she isn't at home (maybe school, a club or therapies she might go to) if any of them align with your times, brilliant. If not, request your neighbour if he could take her out for a walk, swimming or any other activities for an hour or two till you're done with the bathroom and hopefully try to be as quick as you can till the bathroom is complete. Maybe also suggest that he takes his daughter to a room that is furthest away from your home and put on TV or music with whatever her favourite is and put on noise cancelling headphones on her so at least she can't hear the noise as loud as she usually does. If massage helps her calm down, do that while the headphones are on.\nI know you're in a tough spot but so are they.
