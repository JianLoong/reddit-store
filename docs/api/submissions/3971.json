He has like 300 people in his family lol no matter what day we chose, I bet it would have been someone\u2019s bday!", ">I\u2019m surprised no one in the comments is bringing up the fact that out of all the days to get married, his brother literally chooses his nephews birthday.\n\nI actually can see that.  Couples are still going to be dealing with Pandemic backlog, especially if they want Saturday night.  I wouldn't be too hard on anyone at this point for grabbing the reception hall slot they can.  With parents, any Grandparents, six siblings alone on his side, and who knows how many on his wife's, it was probably likely there wouldn't be a slot that would be ideal for everyone, even without the backlog.\n\nBrother didn't want them there.  I find it kind of hard to believe OP doesn't know why.  I think he's deliberately leaving that kind of major detail out.", "This does not seem that aH-ish to me since in their family there are 6 siblings.  Using 4 as the average number of kids each sibling had based on OP\u2019s post That\u2019s 24 nieces and nephews and who knows how many great nieces and great nephews.  That\u2019s just OP\u2019s family.  Add in his wife\u2019s family and that there are only so many long weekends in a year to have a wedding.\n\nIt would be a logistical nightmare to leave out everyone\u2019s birthday - birthday/weekend.", "Because OP is jealous of bro and his family, according to another comment OP is contempt of their niece and nephew due to them being able to afford nice things and are not fat.", "\u201cAnd the Brother intentionally chose his nephews birthday.\u201d\n\nThere is no way he remembers the birthday have a nephew he never sees. OP has no relationship with their sibling, they weren\u2019t even told about the wedding let alone invited. The date was a coincidence.", "It could not matter less for his wedding to be on his nephew\u2019s birthday.", "Happy Cake Day!", "I bet if his brother were posting we would find out why. Not all families are happily close. He clearly included the people who were important to him, as is his right. Instead of reaching out like a grown up and having a conversation he tattled. YTA.", "Even if it was intentional, who cares? Like literally what is the impact, especially when the family doesn\u2019t see each other that often anyway? There is now more to celebrate on that day? Oh the horror! \n\nMy aunt and uncle got married on my birthday, which also happens to be two days before one of her sons birthday. We celebrated both our birthdays the day before their wedding, they had a nice little \u201cbirthday cake\u201d for the two of us at the wedding, and every year since they call and sing me happy birthday and I wish them a happy anniversary back.", "I'm a five hour plane ride from my sister and we are not very close. I can literally tell you one of my nephews' birthdays and that's because he was born on Christmas. I can tell you their first names but that's it. I find it perfectly believable that he didn't know what day the birthday actually is (they celebrate on Thanksgiving which changes dates every year) especially since they aren't all that close", "With 6 siblings and at least 9 (likely more) in the next generation, there's probably more weekends with a birthday party than without. Highly doubt he even realized it was his nephew's birthday considering the brothers don't seem at all close. And he shouldn't have told because it wasn't his news to share; his goal was to his brother look bad in the eyes of the rest of the family.", "Because not everyone has a loving family they get along with\u2026 you can also invite whoever you\u2019d like to your wedding especially if you and your spouse are the ones paying for all of it.", "Where does it say OP\u2019s kids were invited?", "Again , why do you care if he sees the rest of the family or not ? You mentioned that you guys are not close. So you are obsessed about his only for the money he makes and you and your girls are jealous of his kids", "So he \"always tried to see the family\" and the one time he doesn't you do this? That is absurd. Do you hear yourself right now?", "You've said you're not close, so why is this such a huge issue?", "But according to you, you two aren\u2019t that close so why does it matter if he misses the birthdays?", "Your brother didn\u2019t want you and your family at his own wedding. What in god\u2019s name makes you think he wants to spend thanksgiving or your kid\u2019s birthday with you?", "This child is your son, not his. And you\u2019re not close to your brother, either emotionally or physically. If your son\u2019s birthday wasn\u2019t close to Thanksgiving, your brother would never have been there at all; most people don\u2019t fly for 4 hours to go to a kid\u2019s birthday party when they\u2019re not close to the parents. And given the size of your extended family, it would be a lot of parties to go to if he went to all kids\u2019 birthdays.", "He had good reasons for not telling you.", "why would you ever think its N T A, they crashed his wedding and made one of his happiest days the worse day of his life???", "Maybe reflect on why he didn\u2019t invite you and your other siblings? I\u2019m thinking because you\u2019re an asshole. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA and you are even more TA for not accepting your judgment. \n\nFirst, you are conflating issues here. Admit to yourself that your hurt is not because your brother missed your son\u2019s birthday - it\u2019s because you weren\u2019t invited to his wedding and didn\u2019t know he was getting married in the first place. You don\u2019t even care if his kids are there with him to celebrate your son (ya know, your nieces and nephew), so how much does \u201cfamily\u201d really matter to you? How often do you talk to your beloved brother? \n\nSecond, you telling the rest of the family when he clearly preferred for them not to know is gross of you. You sowed chaos in order to make yourself feel better. Call your brother to hash it out with him why you and the others weren\u2019t invited. Don\u2019t put it in the family group chat. Poorly done. I can see why you weren\u2019t invited.", "I have so many cousins. (Big families on both sides) There isn\u2019t a weekend that isn\u2019t someone\u2019s birthday. But we all know how many of us there is so there is no hard feelings when only a couple from each family gets invited. Usually my brother and his wife because they don\u2019t have children yet.", "Exactly! My dad is one of 5 siblings, I have over 20 cousins (which is not counting all of our spouses and kids). When I was a kid the whole family gathered at my grandparents' house every other Saturday and there was almost always a birthday or two to be celebrated. \n\nEven if there isn't any underlying toxicity (which I would assume there is given the level of animosity) it is almost impossible to accommodate everyone's important days.", "Honestly. There's only so many weekends in the world, and a birthday in a family that wasn't even invited is not nearly enough to be a major conflict with a wedding.", "If it was intentional, he was probably hoping they'd be too busy fussing over OP's son to come to his wedding. The audacity of some people to expect to be invited to another's wedding, unbelievable.", "My cousin had her 15 years old party (a debutante one, absolutely glam, two dresses) at my 13th birthday. You know what I did? I hugged her very tightly and was happy, and we celebrated my birthday the next day on her house eating MOUNTAINS of candy and finger food that weren't eaten at the party. Oh I miss the stomachache lol. (I got my own Debutante party after when I was 15. But due to logistics I had to schedule it for almost a month after my real birthday. Had two cakes.) \n\n\nBut maybe we are just... Family that like each other? Wild concept for OP. (YTA OP, there are 7B+ people on this planet and only 365 days to be born)", "My sister had her daughter on her birthday, and then I had MY twins on her birthday too. (Tried not to, but it happens.). We celebrate my twins\u2019 birthday a month before along with my older daughter, so that my niece can celebrate with her friends on her birthday (and so can ours.)", "Right? I would have to really stop and think about when my niece and nephew\u2019s birthday are and I only have one of each.\nI doubt my aunts and uncles could have told you the date of my birthday", "More likely did it around thanksgiving for that reason", "I think her brother knew she was a shit stirrer and avoided inviting her for good reason. She only proved his point.", "Op admitted in another comment their daughters bully his daughter to the point of tears and OP will not step in because OP agrees thinks it is the niece's fault because she is skinny/wears nicer clothes and OP's kids are overweight/have less nice clothes.  The bullying is why he is no contact.", "Main character syndrome by proxy!", "Op didn\u2019t tell them to go. They obviously knew they weren\u2019t invited bc they didn\u2019t get an invitation. Op just gave them info", "OP will never see it, however. Who wants to bet OP's done crap like this far more often than this scenario we're judging her on?", "So why are you upset that he had his wedding on your sons birthday and chose to keep it tight lipped, if you\u2019re not that close?", "Then why do you care if he attends your silly party for your son ?", "Yes. Life happens. There are changes in jobs, marriages, etc. Life doesn't stay static. Kids change things. Maybe they'll decide to do Thanksgiving with the wife's family.\n\nNone of this has anything to do with you.\n\nIf you want to see him, because you actually *want* to see *him* as opposed to fulfilling a perceived obligation, then invite him and be  grateful and happy at the times when he is able to come.", "Who cares? He\u2019s an adult with his own kids. You guys don\u2019t have to be at each other\u2019s kids birthday parties.", "But the reasons she gave them the info was spiteful. She decided since he hadn't told her that she was going to tell everyone. \n\nShe doesn't actually know what he had planned to do announcement wise.\n\nI'm also willing to bet conversation about people going anyway would have happened at that lunch, she absolutely knew what a clusterfuck she was about to cause and didn't give a shit.", "He's wealthy. Probably gives expensive gifts.", "I don't think that's why you weren't invited OP. I'd bet a whole lot of money that you weren't invited because of something about YOU.", "Nope. That's not it.", "A gift grab is right, he probably ponies up a very nice gift that they wouldn't have the budget for.", "Why does he have to pretend to care about family when you are actively showing you don\u2019t care about him?", "It is not her fault your children are jealous of her (you sound a little jealous yourself) but it is your fault that your children bully her so much she cries to the point she\u2019s desperate for parent involvement because you won\u2019t parent your kids.  You should self-reflect on why so many of your siblings are no/low contact before you lose everyone else.", "So you mean to say, because the his kids are with their mom, he is obligated and you are entitled to his attendance during your son's birthday. Does that give you the privileged to force someone who doesn't want to attend your son's birthday to actually show up? Because that's the only time your family could see each other, they can only see each other on your son's birthday?", "So everyone sees each other on Thanksgiving, why does everyone have to show up for a kids bday?", "Your son doesn\u2019t own the thanksgiving holidays. Other ppl are allowed to have celebrations around that time that doesn\u2019t involve you and your son. Probably your brother\u2019s new family have relatives that can only attend on thanksgiving. I can\u2019t believe you think your son\u2019s bday is special when there are countless children in your extended family.", "Or maybe she wanted expensive gifts for her son. I mean isn't it so convenient, everyone of her family is gonna attend her son's birthday, so the rich brother would be pressured to attend and you know how some families are, scrutinizing you if you won't have present or if your present no expensive enough if your rich.", "Not everyone sees each other on thanksgiving. My brother and his kids visit his ex wife\u2019s family on every holiday. Some of my other siblings visit their spouse\u2019s family for thanksgiving but everyone\u2019s usually available right before or right after thanksgiving", "He\u2019s not"]}
