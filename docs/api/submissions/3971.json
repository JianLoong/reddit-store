My brother has 5 (16f, 15m, 12f, 3f, 4mo f). We don\u2019t get together often because my girls and his oldest don\u2019t get along and because we\u2019re a 4 hour plane ride from each other. \n\nMy son\u2019s birthday is around thanksgiving. We\u2019re always with my family on thanksgiving and we always have a big family party for his birthday. \n\nMy brother is a busy person (owns a large company) so I was asking him what day he\u2019d be available for the party. He wasn\u2019t available any day, which I thought was weird considering he always tries to meet with me/the rest of our family around thanksgiving. \n\nThen I got a text from a mutual friend asking what I was wearing to my brother\u2019s wedding and if I had any ideas for a gift since she couldn\u2019t find a registry. I asked her what she was talking about and my friend told me that he was getting married. I didn\u2019t even know he was engaged. He told us last year that he was in a relationship and they had just had a child together but nothing about getting married. \n\nAfter some digging, I found out that the wedding would be on my son\u2019s birthday and only 2 of our siblings/their kids are invited. \n\nI thought this was incredibly rude of him so I decided to tell the entire family at thanksgiving that he was getting married, when, and where. \n\nSome family members made an appearance at his wedding and he found out I was the one who told them about it. He called me the next day screaming at me for \u201cruining his wedding\u201d then blocked me on everything. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel bad so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1670195159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcoys8/aita_for_telling_the_entire_family_that_my/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be livid if someone told the toxic members of my family I was getting married. The fact that they actually went, not being invited says a ton about how toxic they are. Never disrespect someone\u2019s right to go NC.", "YTA \n\nBased on how you handled this I can see why you were left off the guest list", "YTA it sounds like your brother has gone LC (now NC) with you and other members of your family, and  in any case is not obligated to invite you or anyone else to his wedding. More to the point absolutely no one is required to schedule their wedding around your son\u2019s birthday party. It would be one thing if you shared the info with your family as a curiosity, but you clearly state you found his entirely not rude behavior to be rude and spitefully shared all his wedding info, clearly to have your people crash it, which they then did.", "YTA for starting drama / outing your brother's plans just because you were petty and mad at him over something else.", "YTA. he didn't invite you and the other siblings? gee, i wonder why... /s", "YTA. Holy moly. \n\nClearly he has a reason for not inviting you and the other family. Maybe do some self reflection into that. You maliciously told your family. They crashed his wedding. \n\nI hope your apples fall far away from the tree.", "YTA, and yikes. You admit the two of you aren\u2019t close. He doesn\u2019t owe you an invitation to his wedding or any information about his life. You probably just reinforced his decision to keep you at a distance.", "YTA. It is never your place to make announcements on behalf of other people without their permission. \n\nYou guys clearly aren't that close, so why should he care that it's your son's birthday?", "Of course YTA \n\nThere was a reason he didn\u2019t tell you and didn\u2019t invite the rest of the family. This response from you is likely a good indication as to why.", "YTA of course. If some of you weren't invited to the wedding, there's a reason for that. And if your family thought crashing a wedding was the right thing to do, I can see why your brother didn't invite them in the first place.", "YTA. So you caused extremely drama when you admit you are not close to him, and you want to make sure you are the asshole for ruining his wedding? Yes. Yes, you are.", "YTA- did you ever stop to think that he had HIS reasons for not wanting certain people there.  Of course not!  You chose to disclose this information because of your childish reaction to his not wanting you there.  I am sure he has very valid reasons for not wanting you there.  News flash the world does not revolve around you or your son's birthday. Congrats on destroying your relationship with your brother.", "YTA!\n\nIf he wanted you or the rest of the family to know, he would have told you.\n\nWhat an AH! you are!", "YTA - Really?!? You think there\u2019s a world where you\u2019re somehow not?! What an absolutely miserable person you are.", "YTA.  There\u2019s a reason some people didn\u2019t get an invite.", "YTA", "Yta and bro you are an adult and that was some childish ass behavior.", "YTA this was none of you business and you did it out of spite. You said you found out the details after doing \u201csome digging\u201d he didn\u2019t tell you on purpose. He also didn\u2019t tell the rest of the family on purpose and you took it upon yourself to GOSSIP. Yes that\u2019s what is was and you said you thought it was RUDE? He can get married any day he wants. You are not entitled to claim every thanksgiving family gathering to be your own celebration, if people want to join your celebration that\u2019s wonderful but you are not entitled to it. What you did was awful.", "Yta", "YTA\n\nYou wanted to cause drama for his wedding, you seem more upset that it\u2019s on the same day as your child\u2019s birthday than not being invited. \nIt feels like there is some missing information.", "YTA\n\nSo he's getting married and didn't tell you.\n\nYou don't handle that by telling all the family without his agreement, you handle that by calling and telling him you heard he was getting married.\n\nYou don't know why you and the other 4 siblings were left out and you didn't even care to ask. You just went straight to retribution.\n\nFor all you know he might have wanted to have a small event, or had limitations on finances/or number of guests. He might have been planning to tell you but you beat him to the punch.", "YTA - you werent invited for a reason, trying to sabotage it is just petty and vindictive. Sounds like he may have been right not inviting you.", "YTA.", "YTA", "This is petty revenge.", "YTA\n\nYour brother must have had reasons for not inviting the whole family. His wedding was not your news to break. You seem bitter that you were not invited and acted very childish to get revenge. Don't be surprised if your brother chooses to never speak with you again.", "I get that he may make a point of coming every other year but clearly he kept this info from family members for a reason. And if you had just poked around asking \"hey, did you know anything about (brother) getting married?\" that would be one thing. But making an announcement to everyone at Thanksgiving with full details of when and where makes YTA", "YTA", "Lol... YTA... Obviously. I understand being upset if i don't get an invitation and really, getting married on the same day of a relative's birthday is just petty. I'd have just announced that I've found out that he was getting married on the same day of my son's birthday. But, I'd have never say where, especially if i had the slightest suspicious one of my relatives could crash the wedding.\n\nIf I were in a good mood I'd have just called my brother and asked him WTF was wronged with him and proceeded to blocked NC. If he didn't want me in his wedding it was pretty obvious i wasn't important in his life, so goodbye forever.", "So fake, so dumb.\n\n\nYour brother thought he could pull off a secret wedding without any of his family finding out? Even though two of your siblings were invited? Does this seem believable?\n\nAnd then when they did find out instead of talking to your brother \u2026they crashed his wedding? Does this seem believable?\n\nAnd your kid\u2019s birthday falling on the same day was what caused your outage? Not that the wedding was a secret and only a limited amount of family was invited?

How do you fix this?", "He deserved it. Not informing his family is a slap in their face. He got it back.", "Nta. He kept it a secret without reasoning.

No boundaries at all.", "So, you're the center of the universe and your son is a shining star to be worshipped by all?\n\nOP, most anniversaries would hold higher priority between the married couple.", "That's a hell of an assumption.", "Seeing as he doesn't even like you I don't think he needs much of an excuse to miss your precious sons birthday.  Get over yourself you are not the main character in his life story.  He is not all that important to you yet you are shocked, shocked I tell you! That for some reason his life doesn't revolve around you and your children.  Get over yourself.", "There\u2019s a lot of people in your family.  It\u2019s going to be very difficult to avoid all of their birthdays.  Are you this precious about your daughters and their birthdays, or just your son?  How many of his kids have you at all their birthdays?\n\nIt sounds like your son has been lucky to have big family birthdays because of the timing of his celebration.  That\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not owed to him for people to make sure that continues.", "Sorry, misread. Invites half his siblings and not the others but point still stands.

He is not obligated and you even said the kids aren\u2019t close", "That doesn't mean you're close, that could just means he feels a sense of obligation to show up once a year.", "You can't know that because you didn't ask what his plans were.

They might do a bit of reflection on the state of that relationship.\n\nQuite frankly, no matter what spin you put on this you did the wrong thing and you did it because you were being spiteful.\n\nThat alone makes you the asshole.", "So, that gave you the right to announce HIS news to everyone else? \n\nDid t occur to you that he and his wife had their reasons for a small gathering?", "Well considering it was not his siblings who spilled the beans ya... They wouldn't have found out till after the fact. No one is obligated to invite you to their wedding", "None of my siblings told us about the wedding.

It runs in the family), and she always has the newest electronics around my kids. Despite all of this, she still runs to her dad in tears every time one of my girls says something about her.", "What my take away from this comment is you blame their weight solely on genetics. Which apparently gives them a free pass to bully their skinny cousin ? \n\nUnless you can give us examples of her bullying them I'm going to believe you're just a family of AHs.", "So your kids are jealous of her expensive clothes and electronics and they bully her. Got it. How exactly does she rub her natural body shape in their faces? Is it just her existing or does she say things to them? Cause it sounds like they're just jealous.\n\nHer existing with her expensive electronics does nothing to your jealous kids. \n\nYTA. No wonder you weren't invited.", "What exactly does \u201crubbing it in their faces\u201d mean to you?", "Genetics plays a big part of it. My oldest was a swimmer then she wrestled throughout high school. My middle danced at least 10 hours a week until she was 15. My youngest daughter plays softball. They all workout but they\u2019re still overweight. \n\nAlso, my girls invited the oldest to go thrift shopping with her and she said \u201cno thanks, I can never find anything my size there\u201d and jokes about having to get pants in the kids section because adult ones are too big. My oldest also asked her for a sweater once and she said to ask her dad because she wouldn\u2019t fit in any of hers."]}
