We\u2019re always with my family on thanksgiving and we always have a big family party for his birthday. \n\nMy brother is a busy person (owns a large company) so I was asking him what day he\u2019d be available for the party. He wasn\u2019t available any day, which I thought was weird considering he always tries to meet with me/the rest of our family around thanksgiving. \n\nThen I got a text from a mutual friend asking what I was wearing to my brother\u2019s wedding and if I had any ideas for a gift since she couldn\u2019t find a registry. I asked her what she was talking about and my friend told me that he was getting married. I didn\u2019t even know he was engaged. He told us last year that he was in a relationship and they had just had a child together but nothing about getting married. \n\nAfter some digging, I found out that the wedding would be on my son\u2019s birthday and only 2 of our siblings/their kids are invited. \n\nI thought this was incredibly rude of him so I decided to tell the entire family at thanksgiving that he was getting married, when, and where. \n\nSome family members made an appearance at his wedding and he found out I was the one who told them about it. He called me the next day screaming at me for \u201cruining his wedding\u201d then blocked me on everything. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel bad so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m seeing that some people are confused. First of all, my brother didn\u2019t want a small wedding. There were at least 300-400 people at the wedding. Second, the wedding was not on thanksgiving.

And you acted like a spoiled rotten teenage high schooler at a family Thanksgiving dinner?  Oy.  And you have to wonder why you were not invited.  And omg, it was planned on your child\u2019s birthday, which you have every year because you are all together. Your brother has a busy work schedule.  Maybe he had no other day to plan said wedding.  Why is such a big family that seems to only get together a few times a year only celebrating one child\u2019s birthday?  Why not a big party for all birthdays?  And it sounds as if all kids are older, so if some do not get a long, they should be mature enough to be respectful for a few hours of each other and with a large gathering, easy to avoid each other.

Some people also call her TA because they think that her children bully her niece and she dismisses it, but as long as we don't have anymore evidence for that I don't jump to this conclusion. There are many reasons why teenagers don't get along and making niece the victim of bullying is only a way of Reddit to antagonise OP even more.\n\nWell, I am not free of not interpreting too much, but with brother still trying to be involved with his family and not being NC with them doesn't make me think that there is a real issue with OP and the rest of the family other than not being fancy enough for his wedding. He owns a company, so I guess from the 300 to 400 guests most of them were some business partners and his girlfriend's family. Do you know anything about her, OP? Needless to say, many guests which are higher up at the food chain and brother probably only invited the side of the family he thought of good enough for that kind of event. That's one thing that's bothering me, the second is the time of the wedding:\n\nWell, this isn't up to much interpretation because we know from OP that the whole family comes together to celebrate thanksgiving and her son's birthday, including her brother. You could dismiss that he celebrated his wedding on his nephew's birthday because he is a business owner and doesn't have that much time etc., but he also made two of his siblings families also miss the party and probably thanksgiving, too. All that with no explanation. Also, everyone who ever married knows that having a party that big takes a lot of preparation that doesn't happen over night, so he most likely lied to them for way over a year. Not only that, but he expected others to lie for him which is almost never ok.\nDon't consider someone family if you can't even tell them that you are getting married.

Overweight kids can and are sometimes the bully.  Based on other comments, it\u2019s niece who ends up in tears, not OP\u2019s kids. Having nice and/or expensive things does not make a person a bully. Being skinny does not make someone a bully. People *are* more likely to become bullies if their parents are mean and/or dismissive regarding the feelings of others which is what OP demonstrated in the action of telling the rest of the family Info behind brother\u2019s back knowing it would cause problems and hurt people and make people angry with him.", "If it was the other way around then the *siblings* that were invited would have said something; this wasn't the brother cutting everyone out, or inviting all siblings except the OP, this was the brother very carefully cultivating the selection of what parts of his family he even wanted there on his special day. The fact that he had hundreds of guests even without the majority of his family makes it even clearer that he and his spouse are popular people with a huge support network; the brother had reason to not invite family, OP knows her family and clearly acted with malicious intent when informing people of the event, so their 'oh woe is me, how was I ever to know that the assholes I informed of the event would crash it' rings hollow; OP is TA, their actions show *exactly* why they and the gatecrashers weren't invited.", "I mean that it could also be the other way around why the kids don't get along (some jumped to the conclusion that OP's kids bully the daughter of her brother. Couls also be that daughter acts like a spoiled brat or their personalities simply clash). But having a big wedding doesn't always mean that you have a strong support network but that's a different story.\nWhat really bothers me is that people don't think it through when they invite one half of their family and not the other. As a family member, you are expected to be invited to a wedding (unless NC or other reasons). Heck, it was so much expected from OP to be invited that her brother's friend called her to ask for a present! Not telling your family from your wedding is one thing but it seems like nobody is aware that they still have some explaining to do or did he expect not to tell anyone that his girlfriend is indeed his wife? OP is a big AH for telling everyone and I am not even doubting that she did it out of spite, but the reason why I call her brother TA is because my uncle did pretty much the same. He invited some of his siblings (they were ten) and didn't tell his other siblings and parents because they weren't fancy enough for his big wedding. The family dynamic was ruined from this day on even though he tried to redeem himself. Mind you that this happened almost 40 years ago and my grandmother hold a grudge till her dying day. Seems like brother doesn't have the balls to tell them that they are not invited or to cut them out of his life completely.

LPT: If you are giving someone the silent treatment, you have to tell them first.", "I don't get this logic she is in no way obligated (morally or otherwise) to keep his wedding a secret.", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t care now or when I was a kid. My family is spread out everywhere. It would be cool to see them on my birthday, even if it wasn\u2019t FOR my birthday.", "I feel like the brother though may not be a saint here either. Im just speculating here, but if the brother knows his family members are assholes, knows that the family all get together for thanksgiving, and didn\u2019t invite some of those family members to his wedding taking place shortly after thanksgiving, he should have anticipated that the uninvited family members would find out and be upset. If he knows his family sucks, he also should have anticipated that finding out about the wedding in that manner would cause drama with those family members. It seems that the brother made no effort to try to avoid that drama. \n\nWhile OP was an AH, the brother was either very dumb not to expect the drama, or is also an AH and knew he would cause drama with his family with the way he went about the invite situation.", "You seriously think you are not the asshole?

I would have been hurt too but that\u2019s how he decided to have his wedding. Be mad and handle it between you and him.", "Imagine a grown-ass person being jealous of a teenager.", "YTA. I see why you weren't invited.", "I don't have words for that nonsense. That's victim blaming plain and simple."]}
