Not only are you not respecting his personal space, but you are also in a position to hear sensitive information regarding other clients cars and costs. We often have tricky conversations with people about tough costs that can be unavoidable and can be very sensitive. You are also preventing this person from allowing another client at their desk to discuss matters pertaining to their car. \n\nThe fact that you own a Lexus doesn\u2019t mean you deserve better treatment. I have worked for very high up luxury brand cars and entitled people like you make my job the hardest. Grow up and get a Toyota or come prepared. \n\nFurther, these new cars don\u2019t take an hour for an \u201coil change\u201d they are complex vehicle with over 40 odd computers in a car. And that takes time. \n\nAnd I can guarantee you\u2019re the person coming in for a \u201cwait service\u201d that adds 20+ complaints on the day and expects a 2 hour turnaround with your free wash.\n\nDon\u2019t be a dick to service people.

Someone\u2019s desk is their \u201cprivate\u201d space, when I worked I kept a picture of my son on my desk and while it was one thing for my coworkers to see my son it would be WEIRD AF for some random creep to be sitting at my desk with my child\u2019s picture there.", "YTA. Minimum ask someone at dealership if there is a place where you could do some work while waiting.", "YTA obviously.\n\nI work internet sales for several luxury dealerships, so I am on the phones all day.

It was clean as I had mentioned earlier, it didn\u2019t look like it was desk that was being used. It was also very close to the waiting area where people were waiting to get the car serviced.

Def a big learning for me personally.", "Agreed, the situation definitely could have been handled better by everyone involved!", "I had to scroll SO far down to find a comment that acknowledged that the salesman was rather out of line publicly shaming and berating a customer.

He didn't acknowledge the guy's question and is acting like the guy is being unreasonable. \n\nIf I walked into my office and you were working at my desk I'd ask who the hell you were and to get out of my damn office. And then I would ask how you would like random assholes camping at your desk and shut the door as you walked out. Then I would start checking my drawers to make sure you didn't steal anything, like my wallet, or take other people's files, or steal people's account numbers. I mean there are serious issues with a random stranger at your desk. In a dealership I would be worried about customer information being stolen, or my information.

I am a teacher and always have grading and paperwork, so I do it while I wait.", "Felt the exact same, really surprised that there\u2019s not more comments on his behaviour being totally inappropriate.

Only difference is the walls are temporary. Did the salesman overreact a bit? Sure. But OP\u2019s definitely not NTA because of that. At worst YTA, at best ESH\n\nEdit/Add-on: his other comments also make him more and more of an AH.

I work at a dealer, and anything sensitive is supposed to be locked up, but that salesperson could get in SO much trouble if anything close to PII was left out that OP could see.
