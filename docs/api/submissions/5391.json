But there\u2019s a difference between walking into my home or car and seeing someone using it vs a business where I am there for a reason and using their resources. I am not justifying my actions, I should have asked and will do so in future. But this comparison doesn\u2019t equate to my position I was put in!", "Company could have faced liability if you rummaged through or obtained customer financial and personal information.\n\nFrankly, they should have banned you from the dealership", "Answer the question", "You act like a coworker you get coworker energy \ud83e\udd37\n\nYou don't deserve an apology imo.", "God you are tiresome. He did not owe you an apology.", "He wasent servicing you so no he didn't need to be over the top friendly. The availableility of the desk does not make it free to  use. If u asked an employee and they directed you to the decks it would be completely different.yta", "How entitled are you that you expect an apology for that. You were 100% the AH, just own up to it. The other guy did nothing wrong.", "Your actions were BIZARRE. Most people would not even consider using a random persons desk while waiting for their car to get done. That is invasive and entitled. Because of that, you do not get to expect customer service type interactions when you were acting so outside the norm. He had every right to treat you the way he did.", "Maybe he\u2019s a germaphobe and having a stranger sitting in his chair, at his desk quite literally ruined the rest of his day. \n\nMaybe he has a bad back and has the chair adjusted *just so* to keep it from spasming, and he was worried you might have messed up his settings. \n\nMaybe his dog died this morning and he\u2019s thinking about how he has to bury his best friend when he gets home from work, and gets in and some ASSHOLE who he doesn\u2019t even KNOW is sitting at his FUCKING DESK!\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever right to yell at strangers, but I think you should just pick the scenario that makes it easiest for you to empathize with him coming off so hot. Right now, you\u2019re getting caught up in whether his reaction was proportionate or not, and are not really reflecting on why YOUR choices here were objectively disrespectful to this stranger\u2019s space.\n\nThe fact that you apologized doesn\u2019t change that you did something you shouldn\u2019t have done, and that realistically you should have *known* it was wrong to do before you did it. Your work issues that needed immediate attention are no one\u2019s problem but your own.", "My point is not that. I am coming from a place where you run a business and customers walk in and out. I am there for a reason, although I agree my actions were way out of line, there is a way you talk to customers. That\u2019s just business 101, you don\u2019t want to intimidate your customer. As the famous adage goes \u201c the customer is always right\u201d. I am not saying my actions are right but the point being is to be decent in talking to customers and not make a scene in front of everyone and embarrass them.", "Beauty of a laptop is you really shouldn\u2019t need to \u2018hook it up\u2019 and it can work while sitting on your lap. If you were taking in your car you should have either arranged a loaner so you could pick it up again later or planned better to take a charged laptop so as not to rely on available outlets.\n\nYTA for the entitlement, there were better ways you could have handled all of this", "Wow. You really think the world revolves around you.", ">But there\u2019s a difference between walking into my home or car and seeing someone using it vs a business where I am there for a reason\n\nUpon entering, did he immediately know your business there?\n\n>using their resources.\n\nTheir resources that you didn't have permission to use, you mean?", "Situation you were put in?! Literally every car owner has had to wait for service at some point. And most of us have jobs that we manage to also do while staying in the designated area for customers. \n\nWhat you did is actually worse, because there may have been customer or company sensitive information in or around his personal desk so it might have affected more than just the one guy whose desk you squatted at.", "a desk is not a resource their customers can use. \n\nmy dealership has a space for customers to sit and wait. I would never walk over to their work space (which is 20ft from their customer area) and make myself comfortable.", "You are a bigger AH than we thought.  The customer isn\u2019t always right.  In fact, anyone that has worked in customer service will tell you that the majority of the time, the customer is wrong.\n\nYTA and the fact that you keep thinking that anyone owes you any sort of respect in the face of your disregard, is rude and entitled.  I\u2019m sure this is just a blimp of what you are truly like in other areas in life.  \n\nAnd before you get all Lexus on me, I\u2019ve been in the same type of luxury vehicle waiting rooms for my own car service and I bring my laptop everywhere cause I work remotely.  Once I had a last minute call that popped up.  I asked a service coordinator if they had any space and they set me up in their conference room.  \n\nTreat others the way you want to be treated.  Period.", "All those options were explored and they didn\u2019t have a loaner. They said it\u2019s a 3 hr wait and for anything less than 5 hrs they don\u2019t give away loaners. I get it, life lesson learnt!"]}
