If you feel hurt, insecure, or jealous of this girl you can absolutely politely decline the trip and not be an asshole. I would guess that you allowing jealousy to get in the way of a nice family trip, but it's your prerogative. Now, if you throw a hissy fit and demand she not go ... Then you'd be the asshole.", "I don't know what's more distressing. The fact so many of these stories are of parents who treat their kids like shit, or the fact that so many of these kids have to come here an ask if they're the asshole for being resentful.\n\nAs you might have ascertained, I'm going with NTA.\n\nYour father is awful. No decent father replaces their kids. With anyone.\n\nWorse, your brother and his girlfriend are only 18. Chances are, she won't be the one whom he settles down with. Or, if she capitulates to your father's manipulation (because that's what he's doing with all these expensive trips; he's trying to bribe her into marrying your brother), it will be terrible marriage that will end badly for him.\n\nHow do I know this? Because she's acting like a total snob who treats you horribly. Any decent woman who is dating your brother will ensure they are polite and friendly to his family. And the fact that she sees his sister like some kind of threat is . . . weird.\n\nShe should be with your brother because she wants to be with your brother. Not because his father pays for her expensive vacations.\n\nSo, your father is, by far, the biggest asshole in this story, with your brother's girlfriend a distant second place. Your brother is third.\n\nAnd you and your 10-year-old brother are not assholes at all.", "NTA - youre not an AH for your feelings, youre also 18 so if you dont want to go on a trip you shouldnt have to. Also, youre not being replaced even though you feel like you are. \n\nSide note - is this a cruise? Because a boat from new york to boston is\u2026 odd.", "NTA but make sure you sit down and talk with your dad first. He could be a turd noodle but hopefully he just doesn't realize how you're feeling and everything can be worked out with a good sit down.\n\nUltimately though its your choice if you want to go, and i dont think you're wrong for not wanting to go if you dont feel like you'd have a good time.

How much effort did you put into talking to her?  Is she shy or just rude?\n\nYour half brother is 10, how much work is it watching him and what would you miss out on doing so?\n\nIf you don\u2019t go, then you\u2019re basically making a self fulfilling prophecy of the gf replacing you.", "NTA\n\nSorry you need to nip the babysitting thing in the bud. \nIf you do go the first time you are asked to babysit you need to tell them \u201cI\u2019m sorry not available this morning - I have other plans.\u201d\n\nIt is grossly unfair that you\u2019re the babysitter.

Whether it's his idea or not, he's not allowing it to happen, he's *encouraging* it by not fighting for you. Do not go on this trip with them. It will suck to miss it, but sounds like you'll be miserable and end up feeling used. That's not worth it. I'm sorry you have to go through this, but start choosing your own feelings over anybody else's.", "I agree with this. While OP's dad has a prenup in place, and his wife was compelled to sign it beforehand, she's also been able to manipulate OP's dad to exclude you, and he isn't advocating for you.\n\nIf she can do that, she's probably hoping that she can further manipulate your father to write you out of the will.  And she may be right.", "Exactly this. Given that you will be the babysitter, it won't be a vacation for you. And your dad's wife doesn't have that relationship with you, so it's not on you to give her a break. And it is your dad's son, so it is his responsibility. The only thing you will miss is spending some time with the siblings."]}
