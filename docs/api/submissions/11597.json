Me and my fianc\u00e9 live with my mother but we were told to leave the house while we had the flu so we went to my fathers house. We got back today. two days ago my mother said they were cleaning out our room because my mother had stuff in here because it was the storage room as well as my room, (I should also say that I also pay half rent) so me and my fianc\u00e9 were not really liking it the situation anyway because we weren\u2019t there and when I get home, one of our pets had been taken my rat. my aunt had wanted one of my rats. I breed rats, so we had said that you could take a rat from the smaller tank, which is separate from the rats that were already spoken for by me and My Fianc\u00e9. when I get home my fianc\u00e9 noticed that his rat was gone so we called up. My aunt who\u2019s had said she wanted one she denied and denied but then she admitted it when I had subsequently went off on her and called her and her daughters a bitch. I then also noticed that $150 worth of gold dollar coins was missing and $30 of silver coins were missing and I said that if I did not have my rats or my money that I was filing a police report I filed a police report and I said if they give me my rat, which is my pet and one of my breeding females that I would drop the charge on the stolen rat, but not on the money.

I will say, as someone who has owned rats throughout my whole life, all of whom were rescues, that I kind of think you're an a****** for breeding rats. Just like I think that most people who breed dogs are assholes too. With the multitude of animals that are given up to shelters, or who go from a loved pet being snake food, I can't understand why you would want to create more of that. Especially if you love them as much as you seem to.", "NTA. They're calling you names because they're in the wrong. It's a last ditch effort to intimidate you into dropping the charges. Stand your ground!", "NTA.  People stole from you.  Just because they are related to you doesn't mean they get to steal from you.  It sounds like they thought they could do it, and try to intimidate or shame you into letting them get away with it.  Not okay, and they deserve the consequences.", "NTA.

You told them if you got the rat back, you\u2019d drop the charges related to the theft of the rat, but that you wouldn\u2019t drop the charges for the monetary theft - and you told them this while they have your rat.  If they\u2019re going to face the more serious legal charge regardless - unfortunately pets are legally property most places so the coins are a higher value - what motivation did you give for them to return the rat?  All you\u2019ve done is make them angry - again, while they have your rat, who they could hurt to get back at you.  This was not smart.  You\u2019re morally in the right but strategically making bad calls.  This is a negotiation - it shouldn\u2019t be, but it is.", "I hope you get your rat back, OP.

We\u2019ve had that rat since it was born my fianc\u00e9 snuggles that rat all the time that\u2019s his favorite.", "Their motivation to return the rat is to avoid having to pay OP for the value of the rat.", "Thank you I hope I do too I hope robin is ok and I hope I get my coins back they have sentimental value", "Thank you for your support. It means a lot to know that I am not the asshole in the situation.", "I was I had a panic attack and everything, but getting the cops called on me would have put me in a bad situation where I wouldn\u2019t of had a job", "If OP presses charges for the theft of the coins regardless, which do you think they\u2019ll value more highly, the cost of a rat or getting back at OP?", "Hard to say, I don't know these people. If they killed the rat to get back at OP, it definitely wouldn't look good in the eyes of a judge, which could be problematic for them if the gold coins are part of the same claim.", "NTA for filing charges, this is NOT petty theft. This is felony charges material.  \n\n\nHave the rat returned, the coins returned and a written apology that you can frame in your living room to drop the charges.", "Nta.  You were robbed and have the right to press charges if you wish", "NTA\nThey're calling you names because they are angry, angry that you are standing up for your right to safety and privacy in your property in your home. It's easy for them to focus anger on you, for your response, to shift attn away from the lack of respect for your belongings and stealing from you. Much easier than returning your pet and stolen property.\n\nBeware of linking your plan for a place of your own on your mom's following through with any promised action. Make plans that are YOUR plans, and can't be blocked or disrupted by your mom, or any of them, deciding not to or just not following through at a critical juncture.\n\nYou are right to stand up for yourself when your boundaries are violated. Boundary stompers often react as yours have.", "NTA It\u2019s time to move out and get your own place.", "does the answer you got make things better or worse lmao"]}
