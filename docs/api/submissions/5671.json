How dare she say such a thing. It's rude, uncalled for, offensive and completely wrong. Doesn't matter if she has been a mother longer. That is zero excuse. And for crying out loud, you're child is only 7 months old. There is plenty of time for your child to socialise. The family calling you an asshole are also assholes themselves.", "NTA. I\u2019m baffled at why anyone would stick their kid in a daycare during a holiday celebration. Once you have kids, the whole point of the celebration is your kid. And, I hope you or your mother explained to the larger family what transpired before you kicked gf out.", "NTA. Disgusting comment to make, I would have told her to leave too. SIL is the AH. It's fantastic that you're able to stay at home and look after your child yourself, there's plenty of opportunities for your child to socialise as she gets older without daycare. Her children are going to have abandonment issues, cannot believe she'd put her children in nursery over Christmas! One thing if you had to work but doing so because you want to party is shocking. Christmas is about family. She sounds awful.", "NTA.

This is her going out of her way to be f***ing rude about something she had no reason to comment on. \n\nAlso, she's a crap parent.

She's using an inappropriate slur in reference to your child's ego you are trying to protect  from RSV which we ask know can be deadly... meanwhile she's just letting someone else care for her kid on a holiday which should be spent with family. Her priorities are clearly not straight.", "NTA. She's so shitty a person that she utilizes childcare to avoid socializing with her child? And your brother, who is also an asshole, wonders if she might be right? Like how? His girlfriend doesn't want to be with her child and he thinks she might be right to leave all his socializing to professional caregivers rather than family?\n\nIt defies. *DEFIES* common sense. The child most likely to have poorly adjusted social skills is the one who spends their time on a merry-go-round of childcare that isn't their parent while their parent socialize and celebrate occasions without them. That's fucking weird. Those types of childcare options are for people with non-traditional work schedules, not lazy people who won't care for their own kids!", "NTA. She basically said your daughter was mentally handicapped", "NTA - she called your baby something horrible while a guest in your home. You had good reason for asking her to leave", "NTA.

She doesn't sound like that great of a mother is she ships her kid off for holidays.", "My though was : Who the fuck put their kid in daycare on Christmas ?\n\nAnd then : Why the fuck did she decide to have a child ? \n\nAnd then : Poor kid. I hope that at least, he has a good father.", "Thank you. Also to the socialisation part we actually are very conscious of that was we aren\u2019t able to have another child so we take our daughter to story time at the library and set up play dates with other families with kids her age. Right now they don\u2019t really play together of course but just to have a bit of exposure as she won\u2019t have siblings or daycare.", "My mother wasn\u2019t there sadly but my auntie filled me in on the story she told which wasn\u2019t entirely accurate and she straightened a few people out for me. The ones who matter.\n\nAlso thank you for saying this! I couldn\u2019t imagine not spending Christmas with my little one.", "I am getting this feeling. I spoke with my auntie who was at the dinner and apparently the way she framed it was also very different from what actually happened and she said I shamed her for putting her child in daycare by saying that wasn\u2019t my plan. Goodness me for thinking we were both allowed separate opinions without it being a direct attack on the other.", "I agree. It sounds like her child is nothing but an inconvenience.", "SIL is using \u201csocialization\u201d as an excuse to not be hindered by their child and to reinforce the rightness of her bad decisions. What you are doing is exactly right at your child\u2019s developmental stage and rsv concerns are totally valid.", "Yeah this is what narcissists do, they will turn it back on you and try to place blame on you. Avoid her", "NTA. I see a divorce in the future for your brother with such a SIL.", "TBH, she should be shamed for putting her kid in daycare on Christmas when she\u2019s not going to work. She\u2019s taking advantage of a service that\u2019s likely meant for folks who have no choice but to work on holidays. People like her cause more people to have to work on holidays. \n\nBesides, who doesn\u2019t want to spend holidays with their young children?", "NTA. daycare on christmas? christmas is for family, isn't the baby family? she's not a \"mother\", she is only a girl who had a baby", "You are doing great. I feel sorry for her kid if *God forbid* it turns out he has some kind of learning disability. \n\nI can guarantee that the only reason you're catching shit from your other family members is because she has left out most of the facts, including that she threw a slur out while shit talking you and your precious little baby. \n\nYou clearly care a lot for your baby and with the public health situation being as it is, your choice to keep her home (even if you just wanted to spend time with her regardless) is perfectly valid and probably the better one at her age, since I imagine its more important for a 7 month old baby to be healthy than be \"socializing\" with a bunch of loud germy kids.", "NTA. And it seems odd to me that the longtime gf wasn't going to come until the last minute.", "She\u2019s leaving her kids with a sitter so she doesn\u2019t have to spend holidays with them?   She\u2019s a gem.", "NTA and I completely understand your rage and the situation in the moment, and in no way were you in the wrong however I don\u2019t think you needed to kick her out but could have just waited for her to leave and just talked shit about her after she was gone.  Everyone was already on your side with her one snarky comment, and from that already lost reputation with the immediately family; hers and yours.  It could have eased to situation to tell your parents and brother that you overheard the conversation after the fact, later on and let them know she was no longer welcome because of it.", "NTA. \"She is not my family if she is going to call my daughter a slur.\"", "Some people disagree with using insults and slurs in their home.\n\nNTA.  \n\nThos wasn't a disagreement, it was outright rude and ableist behaviour.  \n\nHope the door didn't hit her ass on the way out.", "NTA \n\nThat is a terrible comment to make for so many reasons. Why did she even have a child if she doesn't want to see him on the holidays??? Her having been a parent longer means nothing, particularly when she is such a miserable one.", "NTA.

That is emotional neglect. Plain and simple.", "The fact you have the privilege to be home with your kids, and during a time where SO many people are getting sick (nailed it with RSV going rampant)! Plus how bold to have the nerve to say that in your house to your family. Congrats on delivering a calm response, OP! Super NTA. Bravo for composure!", "You should be shamed if you\u2019re using daycare to not spend a holiday like Xmas with your kid.  It\u2019d be one thing if she was working xmas day, but that\u2019s not what this is.", "She should be ashamed for doing just that. This is emotionnal neglect.", "So the person who stuck their kid in daycare resulting in their kid missing the opportunity to learn family social interactions is worried about your kids socialization.

Not a good one.", "She's not family and had no right to say anything even if she was.", "NTA She is and your brother is.", "Brother's girlfriend is an asshole. A dumb asshole, too", "NTA. First, a child doesn't have to be put into daycare to be socialized. Play dates, library activities, kid sports, music lessons, 4-H, other clubs and activity groups.\n\nThere are so many ways to provide socialization to a young child. Plus, doing it that way allows you to be in touch with the socialization your child is getting and guiding it directly. With childcare, you have to trust that what is occurring there is what you want.\n\nSecond, childcare centers that are open on holidays do so for parents that have to work. Not so that people tgat don't want to take their child to a family holiday event can foist them off. If the staff at that center know thats why the GF dropped her kid off, they won't be saying anything, but they're already judging her pretty harshly.\n\nLast, your daughter will grow up feeling secure and knowing her parents love her. The GFs son, if she keeps this up, may end up feeling very insecure and unloved.", "NTA. A proper NTA not a justified A H either", ">My brother stayed neutral saying he didn't approve of what she said but that as she's been a mother longer than me maybe she knows more.\n\nOr maybe he's got no real argument but either has the same asshole opinions about you and your daughter or is too scared to deal with her reaction to call her out on insulting his sister *and* his niece *and* using a slur to do so.", "NTA.  Completely and unequivocally NTA. I have a feeling that woman's poor child will be emotionally neglected.  Add to that she used the particular slur she did...as a close family member of someone with disabilities I'd have gone nuclear on anyone using that slur in my home", "Nta I would have told them to buy me grinch costume.", "NTA. Parenting isn't a \"well they've been parents longer, maybe they know\" situation when it comes to things like this. A crappy parent and crappy person can stay that way no matter how long they've been a parent. She sounds completely intolerable and awful.", "NTA. Ridiculous.", "NTA. Ffs.

I will not let another generation grow up listening to that crap. Now he keeps such opinions to himself if he has them. Not letting my kids learn that at home.\nOh, and  NTA.", "My first thought was what daycare is open on Christmas? I could see one that caters to surgeons and ER doctors or nurses bc the hospital stays open. This is wild! My daycare lady spends holidays with her family and she expects us all to understand she is closed on all major holidays.", "NTA, OP. I have a 6 and half month old and he doesn\u2019t go to daycare. He will be our only child too. I\u2019m also a night shift nurse, so my husband and I work around our schedules. RSV this season is really bad and our local children\u2019s hospital ER is so full there\u2019s a 20 hour wait time and no rooms open. He\u2019s also under one like your baby, and RSV for children under one is particularly dangerous. With this in mind, I didn\u2019t sign him up to any music/gym class until he\u2019s slightly older and pass the RSV season. And if that makes him \u201cmentally handicapped\u201d then so be it, I rather he stay healthy and alive. Plus, do you know what they do with him at daycare? They have more babies than one, so does socialization even happen? These daycare workers are so busy with the amount children, would they have the time to spend for each baby? Anyway, any mother that prefers to spend away from her child on Christmas Day is an asshole.", "One who has a large population of non-Christian clients maybe?", "Nta\n\nShe put her child in daycare on Christmas day.

As long as there\u2019s lots of fun stimulation and interesting experiences and good examples of how to be a stand-up human in her life, what form all that takes is totally secondary!

She's not family - she's a guest in your house who thinks it's her place to tell you how to raise your child.
