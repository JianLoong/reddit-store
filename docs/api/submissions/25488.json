It's a decision she made to lose weight. We\u2019re supportive & help her search 4 alternatives & ensure she's not just eating bland vegs. \n\u00a0\n\n2 years later, we noticed her attitude change. We didnt notice it at 1st but Tom pointed out that Sam reminded him of the Vegan Teacher from Tiktok. \n\u00a0\n\nIt started on Tom's bday when Sam\u2019s in a bad mood. She would demand 2 see the food someone brought & frown whenever she opens the container. She\u2019d do discreet gagging noises whenever someone takes a bite. She\u2019s silent the whole time we were in Tom's house. We asked her what\u2019s wrong but she would say nothing. We just shrugged it off 2 catch up with each other. \n\u00a0\n\nOn Sam\u2019s bday she told us not to bring any food & offered 2 cook. She dramatically improved her recipes, which are occasionally delicious. But that day, I made pastries & sold them in the neighbourhood. I had 2 taste them before boxing them up, so I was half full when I arrived. \n\u00a0\n\nWe were right when we arrived that all the food was vegan. She would only bring vegan food t2 our meet up. They were delicious & we almost finished all the food. I was just too full 2 eat more. @ the end of the day, we piled into Eli's car. I was in a food coma when the rest talked about eating a meal before coming to Sam's house. \n\u00a0\n\nThe next gathering was Eli's bday, & we were shocked 2 find messages from Sam in our GC demanding we bring only vegan food. Eli is the \"steak man\" of the group. He built a smoker & planned to serve us brisket. That was the first time Sam didn't come to our gathering. I'm not confrontational so I kept quiet but the others were vocalising that Sam doesn't have a right to tell Eli what he can & cannot eat on his own bday & house. \n\u00a0\n\nAt Cas's bday, he bought vegan and beef dogs to cook as he's planning to grill, but Sam said that she won't be attending if we plan to eat meat. At the end of that day, she sent a msg that if we plan to serve meat on my bday, dont bother inviting her. \n\u00a0\n\nSo, we discussed what to serve at my house in the GC on my bday. I especially mentioned that I'll prepare a vegan option for every non-vegan dish. Again, Sam was silent in the chat & didn't show up on my bday. \n\u00a0\n\nWe didn't bother inviting her on Bes's bday as Bes wanted to do a Korean BBQ. When Sam saw our pics on FB, she was furious that no one contacted her & complained that we intentionally isolated her. We reminded her what she told us about not inviting her if we were eating meat & told her that we had adjusted for her on Cas's & my bday, but she didn't come. All mention of vegan food 4 our bday was still in the GC & as it was all 'seen' by her, we assumed that she purposely didn't go because not all the food is vegan. She called us AH & left the group. Bes tried to call her but she must have blocked our numbers bc no 1 could reach her. \n\u00a0\n\nSo, are we the assholes?", "created_utc": 1692966672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160xy8y/aita_for_not_inviting_our_vegan_friend/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Veganism is a cult. Sorry you lost your friend to a cult.", "NTA. No real loss there. She sounds self-absorbed.", "NTA - she issued an ultimatum to take control of the situation and you preferred eating meat to her preaching. That is the risk with ultimatiums - they don't go the way you want them to.\n\nYou didn't force her to eat meat, you ensured there were options for her but she wanted every event she attended to be meatless even if someone else's party.\n\nEdit: But do imagine her feelings are hurt and she probably is an ex friend.", "NTA. \n\nShe did this to herself.", "NTA. Sam wanted to control what the rest of you ate. That's a dick move; it's one thing to host a vegan only dinner but when she gets upset that others host and have meat?

Sam can do whatever she wants to do, but can't tell others what to do at their own birthday parties. She decided to leave the group; that's fine. She's only an AH for getting upset that she can't control everyone and for calling the rest of you AHs. Not attending because of her own beliefs is totally up to her.\n\nYour now-smaller group can have fun together eating whatever you want.", "She\u2019s an asshole. Farming is farming and sustainable practices are not put in place for farming vegetables. Every single animal is killed that comes onto the property. Every single ground dwelling animal is killed be the farming equipment every single insect including bees are killed by pesticides. \n\nVegans are just as responsible for murder as anyone else that eats food. Nobody likes them because they are so judgemental. Eat what you want and shut the fuck up about it. If you want people to accommodate you they usually will.

I invited my friend Dan and his GF who RSVP'd yes. Dan called me to let me know his GF was vegan and had a peanut allergy. We went over and above to ensure the was Vegan options and all of them were peanut free and it cost me a small fortune. Guess what they didn't show and we had \u00a330 of vegan food that no one would touch went to waste.\n\nWe don't invite veggies or vegans anymore.", "NTA. She is. Vegans gonna vegan. This often happens after someone converts. There was a story here last week about a child acting the same way when she went vegan. Caused a rift in the family.", "NTA. She's not the birthday girl here. She also sounds like drama and knew meat was on the menu. \n\nI had a birthday where I had invited my friends from school to have dinner with me at a Korean BBQ place. I had a friend of a friend invite himself to my birthday dinner even though he knew it was a KBBQ place. It was miserable all he did was complained all night and got full on rice. Made things very awkward. He did the same thing when we went to eat at chilis too....\n\nYou would definitely be the asshole if you invited your vegan friend and forgot they were vegan lol.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
