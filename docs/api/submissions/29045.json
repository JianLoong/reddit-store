To give a little background, my mom had a hip replacement a few years back.

She's 72, but looks more 50-ish, even acts that way.\n\nWhen we go shopping she always pushes the trolley because it helps with her back and the limping as she doesn't get tired while walking then. \n\nSo I parked in the disabled spot because I don't want her to walk far.\n\nI walked passed a colleague with her family just as we came from the shop and who then teased me that I was taking a disabled persons parking, claimed they just saw my mom walking upright while pushing the trolley so in their eyes there was nothing wrong with her.\nAlso, my mom stays with me and uses my car so no need for a disabled sticker. \n\nI explained to her about my mom's condition and to not always make assumptions, but she already told everyone her side of the story and they are all now laughing at me. \n\nI now ignore her because of that and only speak to her about work while we had a good relationship.", "created_utc": 1697476823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179bc1r/aita_parking_in_a_disabled_parking_spot_for_my_mom/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
