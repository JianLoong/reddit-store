Court might be the way to go if SIL keeps being weird, but also consider your kids feelings and interactions that are leading to this outcome.\n\nEdit from new info: it's not just an isolated event. The kid has known SIL as the main parental figure for almost 9 years, and calling her mom now is a natural consequence.

But the reality is that if her home is stable and safe and there is no evidence of unacceptable behavior, odds are you won't get far if you push for too much at once.   Either way, you should try to arrange to see her more, because with your limited time, your relationship will also  always be limited.\n\nYou can talk to your daughter about it, try to make her understand it hurts you, and see if you can find a compromise that will make everyone happy.

Therapy would still be a solid option, or plan more visitation and family outings but I mean if the kid wants to see the SIL as the mother figure rather than her biological mother after all this time then it's a natural consequence.", "I'm not sure that's true, though. OP says the divorce happened when the kid was 9 months old and that's why the SIL moved in to help take care of her (OP says she wasn't in a good situation to raise a kid). If this kid is 10 now and the SIL has been in her life since she was a baby, raising her...then yeah, I guess the aunt has \"made\" that happen. But that's not the aunt's \"fault.\" Or a red flag. If OP wasn't there to raise her own child, it is natural someone else is going to become \"Mom\" to this little girl. You can tell her, \"That's your mom,\" but don't you think she's going to love and trust the person who's there for her day in and day out, not the woman she spends a couple of weekends with?", "That's fair, but if your SIL has been in your kid's life since she was 9 months old, and you're the person she sees a couple of weekends a month...then it does feel to me that the SIL is more of a mom in this situation. She's the one who's been there when your kid was sick, to help her through any issues with school, to take her to the doctor. It's asking a lot for your daughter to see you as a mother if you haven't filled that role and for your SIL to just see her as a niece if she's had a hand in raising her since she was a baby.", "So you\u2019re \u201cmom\u201d because you gave birth to her and spend a few hours with her every other weekend? \n\nThe more you comment, the more obvious it becomes that this is about you exclusively and your pride, and not about your daughter.", "She is the girl's closest, both in time and emotional intimacy, female biological relation. Typically, we call that person \"Mom\". That is what your daughter has chosen to do. You can also be mom or bio mom. \n\nTrying to force a distance between your daughter and the woman who raised her is only going to lead your daughter to choose not to see you once she has an option. You can't win by making her pick between your ex SIL and yourself being her mom. That battle has been called. \n\nWhat you can do is be the best mother to her that you're capable of, so that your daughter knows that you love her and you respect the important relationships in her life even if adults don't always get along. That's going to get you more in the end then jumping on her when she needs comfort because you don't like what she calls the other woman.", "OK...so if you're the mom, why does your daughter want to call SIL in the middle of the night to be comforted? Why doesn't your child want you to comfort her when she's terrified.", "Bio mom only gets her every other weekend and the dad has primary custody too. As far as I\u2019m concerned the aunt is her mother at that point, she\u2019s doing 90% of the heavy lifting.", "Yes, because the only reason the daughter calls the aunt \"mom\" is because the aunt is leading her to believe this, which is psycho.", "So be OK with the fact that you're not a mother.", ">What's weird is another lady allowing a kid to call her \"mom\" when the kid has a mom.  That's psycho, I'd want my kid nowhere near this crazy lady.\n\nBut that's the thing. You say that \"when the kid has a mom,\" as in OP. To a child, parenthood isn't about who has what title or whose DNA you are. To this kid, \"Mom\" means the person who takes care of me and holds me and tells me I'm special.\n\nYou can tell the kid she has another mom...but I just don't see how that's going to sink in when SIL is the one who's actually being a mom to her. And there's got to be a huge disconnect. The OP is a mother in name only, and the fact that her first response is \"I'm going to court\" because her child calls another woman Mom says a lot. If she were really a mother, her kid would know it.", "US - you\u2019ve never heard of people suing for parental alienation?   Even of they don\u2019t do that I\u2019ve met multiple people who have gone through a mediation process where they negotiate over these issues.", "Because the kid calls her \"mom\" at age 10 despite the actual mom's clarifications.", "Agreed. I think therapy would help, too, but OP does need to realize that no amount of therapy will replace the aunt's role in her child's life. Those are the formative years...", "Its totally on the aunt and major red flags.  Its not hard to make clear \"I'm not your mom, that's a special term for your real mom.  Call me Aunt XYZ or whatever other special term.\"   Then when the kid is scared at night she'll ask for her Aunt instead of her mom.  \n\nFailing to do that for 10 years is psycho and I'd want my child nowhere near this lady.", "Doesn't change the fact that the SIL is leading the girl to believe she's her mom.  She could easily go with \"Aunt\" and make clear to the child who her mom is.  She doesn't.  Which is pyscho and red flags for other maladaptive behaviors in the SIL.", "I'm doing my best\n\nI chose a custody agreement that was better for HER and I try to spend as much time with her as I can\n\nWhat else am I supposed to do?", "Well, if child after nightmare does not want to be comforted by her biological mother  that is right near her but tries to call her aunt - thats a sigh for the OP that for this child she is failing as a mother and problem is bigger than just aunt leading to call her mom. Her daughter does not sees OP as a source of comfort and love. And if instead of providing that OP will go against her daughters real mother figure and only source of comfort and love that little girl now knows - well, that can end badly for her. I'd suggest therapy for all adults involved - so all of them (OP, OPs ex and ex's sister)  will stop holding little girl as living hostage for their issues and insecurities and fix that situation.  ESH", "You keep saying this, but just because you inferred that. OP never said she encouraged this. Are you OP\u2019s husband in real life? Because you seem to have some very strong opinions about the aunt, without actually knowing the story.", "She doesn't have another mom.  She has a mom and an aunt.  The aunt needs to be called aunt.  The mom needs to be called mom. \n\nThere's no \"sinking in.\"  The kid should have been calling her \"Aunt\" from the start, but the Aunt has groomed her into calling her mom.", "I have heard of people suing for parental alienation.  In fact I have gone through the process with my husband and his kids in NY state. That is why I think people who throw it around as if it\u2019s easy are idiots who have clearly not been through the family court system.\n\nThe child still goes for visits.\n\nThere was a case in NY where the father spent $100k+ in legal fees, the mother was proven to have prevented all contact with the for years.  No visits, no calls, nothing.  In the end the court said that the mother had so thoroughly poisoned the child, that it was impossible for the father to rebuild  a relationship and the only end result is that the father didn\u2019t have to pay child support anymore.\n\nFamily court is horrible, stressful and pointless.  Only someone who\u2019s never experienced it would tell someone to go to court over who a child calls \u201cmom\u201d without having actual custody violations.\n\nETA: In our case, over 18 months we spent $12k in legal fees and didn\u2019t even get to trial because it kept getting postponed due to the court being behind schedule.  Theres nothing g quite like sitting in the court waiting room all fucking day just to have your case postponed.", "Well then maybe you should have raised your own child so you could have the ability to make those choices. It has been 9 years and the custody agreement has not been changed", ">She could easily go with \"Aunt\" and make clear to the child who her mom is.\n\nBut honestly...how do you do that when the kid is a baby, or a toddler? This isn't a case of the SIL just coming by once in awhile and saying \"I'm your mom.\" The SIL is the only real mom this kid has known.\n\nETA: Also, I feel like she isn't \"leading her to believe she's her mom.\" Like...she is her mom. This is the person who's been there for her her whole life, who didn't walk away from her. She may develop a good and even loving relationship with OP, but this woman is never going to be Mom to her in the ways that matter.", ">What else am I supposed to do?\n\nDon't yell at the woman who raised her when you yourself admit that she gave your child a better life than you could have. Go down on your knees and thank your SIL for being there for your baby when you weren't. Continue to be part of your daughter's life but don't push it. And don't tell these people who they can call Mom.", "You\u2019re supposed to respect the relationship she has with the woman who is actually raising her.  She\u2019s the person who is there when she\u2019s scared, when she\u2019s sad, when she\u2019s sick, probably when anything that impacts her life, happens.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to like her OP, but you should be happy that your daughter had someone there for her when you couldn\u2019t be, whatever the circumstances may have been. \n\nYou can\u2019t change the past 10 years of your daughter\u2019s life, but you can work to build a stronger relationship with her from here on, and make whatever changes you need to. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to resent your daughter for feeling that your SIL is her mom. And you don\u2019t get to verbally abuse SIL because she stepped up and became the mother your daughter needed then.", "Basically, you have two options.\n\n1.  Accept your place.\n2. Change your place.\n\nRight now you aren't doing the vast majority of the work associated with being \"mom\".  You can work towards changing that (whatever that looks like for you) or you can accept that.  The choice is yours.\n\nAny specific suggestions would probably fall in to one of those two categories.", "A 10 year old calling another lady \"mom\" to her mom is major red flags.", "The aunt has raised her from nearly birth onward. You can't \"groom\" a kid into calling someone mom...the SIL has DONE all the things that moms do. It's not as simple as saying, \"Call me Mom.\" The child has seen other kids and moms, and she knows that her aunt is doing what moms do.", "Yeah if I were the OP I'd definitely do something about the custody agreement ASAP.   She should have nipped this in the bud long ago.  Now her kid is 9 years groomed into not understanding who her mom is.", "Seriously?  You refer to yourself as Aunt and the mom as mom and that's what the kid learns.\n\nIts fine that the kid has a closer connection to the women she's spent more time with, its absolutely not fine to be calling her \"mom\" when she has a mom, which is major major red flags.", "The woman who\u2019s raising her. OP only gets her every other weekend though.", "A red flag that her aunt is providing love for her and playing a major role in her care?", "The whole thing is grooming. The Aunt should teach the kid what to call her.  The only reason the kid refers to her as mom is because the Aunt failed to do this.", "She does understand who her mom is. The woman that raised her. \nWhat did OP do other than give birth to her and see her every other weekend?", "If you're taking care of a kid every day of her life and raising her and you're the person she goes to when she's scared or needs something...you can tell her you're biologically the aunt and that she has another woman who gave birth to her, but you can't really prevent that kid from seeing you as a parent, because that's what you're doing. Parenting isn't a title or a name. It's an action.\n\nIt's also not clear to me that the aunt is making the girl call her \"Mom.\" We only see that the child did that and the OP is going on about the aunt being \"jealous.\" I think the OP knows she doesn't have a parent-child relationship with her own daughter. It doesn't matter what words anyone uses, though...what really matters is who has actually raised the kid. The kid sees her aunt as her mom because the aunt did what moms do.", "No.  A red flag that she allows/encourages the girl to call her mom.", "But it doesn't matter what she calls anyone. The aunt is the only one in this situation who deserves the title of mom. The person you call when you're terrified in the middle of the night and you want someone to comfort you? That's Mom. No amount of court intervention is going to make the child see OP as a mother, and that's the problem. OP is angry that SIL is seen as the mother figure.", ">She does understand who her mom is. The woman that raised her. What did OP do other than give birth to her and see her every other weekend?\n\nI'm reminded of that scene in the Birdcage, when they refer to Katherine as \"the woman who gave birth to Val\" and Albert as Val's true mother.", "You can tell the kid to call you \"Aunt\" or whatever other pet name you like.\n\nIts major red flags not to do so.  The kid wouldn't be calling her \"mom\" if that isn't how she refers to herself, and if she was being corrected by the Aunt if she made the error.", "I would hardly ascribe that as red flag behavior when she has been raising the child since infancy.", "It totally matters what people are called.   The mom is the mom.  If she wants to call her Aunt in the middle of the night because she's closer to her, fine, but don't call her \"mom.\"  Its crazy that the Aunt allows/encourages this."]}
