Court might be the way to go if SIL keeps being weird, but also consider your kids feelings and interactions that are leading to this outcome.\n\nEdit from new info: it's not just an isolated event. The kid has known SIL as the main parental figure for almost 9 years, and calling her mom now is a natural consequence. Granted it sucks as the bio mom, but I mean the most you can do now is maybe compromise with titles. It's not a matter of SIL attempting to take your place, it's just what the kid started doing.

But the reality is that if her home is stable and safe and there is no evidence of unacceptable behavior, odds are you won't get far if you push for too much at once.   Either way, you should try to arrange to see her more, because with your limited time, your relationship will also  always be limited.\n\nYou can talk to your daughter about it, try to make her understand it hurts you, and see if you can find a compromise that will make everyone happy.

This is not really what's going on here.\n\nYou said you don't like the sister and believe she is jealous because she can't have kids.\n\nYou said you think she doesn't like you.\n\nI would stay well away from a court-room with this one.\n\nYou might have to accept that this woman - your ex's sister - is mom #2. Kids often have two moms - all the time. They're called step-parents.\n\nIs this a hang-up about them being brother and sister and not partners? It could be. That's actually what makes this entire case somewhat unusual. But courts will see her as a de-facto step parent under court precedents relating to \"en loco parentis\" which deal with how non biologically tied adults have the responsibilities - and thus, the rights - of biological parents.\n\nCool off. Slow down. talk to your daughter. Be honest. Tell her you thought you were her only mommy and that was super special but now you realize that (sister) is a mommy to her as well and that she's a very lucky little girl because she has two mommies who love her very very much.\n\nEither that or go against him in court and possibly lose. And if you do go to court, she might go back to having only one mom. This man's sister. And not because a judge ruled it, because she chose to resent you for trying to destroy a relationship that is important to her. She's 10. Not 3. She knows what's going on.\n\nYou have a lot to lose here if you can't share the title mom. I get it. It's a tough pill to swallow. But ask yourself what's at stake here. And ask what's best for your daughter.\n\nAnd ask yourself honestly... is this woman really evil incarnate? Or just a threat to you? *What's this really about.*\n\nTough questions and none of my business. But I hope the little girl wins in the end. :-)\n\nI bet both women in this story care deeply about that little girl and would do anything for her. I mean, kids don't call assholes mom just because someone told them to...\n\nKids always lose in these fights I am afraid.\n\nMaybe two good moms isn't as terrifying as you're thinking it is...", "NAH with a caveat. You need to sit down with your daughter and be a proper parent. It doesn't matter who she calls \"mom,\" it matters that she's being raised with love and compassion. Making a thing out of a word is kinda petty. It doesn't matter what you or your SIL wants. If your daughter truly feels like her aunt is like her mother, then just letter her call her that. Choose mommy instead or mama, or mother or something. Be the bigger person here.  If your SIL is firing her into it, she'll be drawn back to you, and if not then she gets two mommas. Don't make this the hill you want to die on because 100% your daughter won't choose you.", "NTA. Take her to court, because you are her mom, not SIL. Also weird if she calls her that and ex dad, they're siblings...", "NTA. Go to court - parental alienation", "Definitely NTA, go to court. This is attempted alienation.", "Honestly, you should have gone to court the second you've been able to handle more custody. The fact that you're only threatening it because aunt has a stronger hold on your daughter's heart means that you haven't felt the need to have your daughter more. \n\nI don't agree with a woman taking advantage of another woman's inability to raise her child...even because she is incapable of having her own...but after 10 years...you allowed the situation to continue. \n\nI also find it highly suspicious that a man allows his sister to live with him and help raise his child...for 10 years. Has he had no relationships?  Is he Fucking his sister?  Might be why she \"won't\" have a kid? I know, pretty nefarious...but I've been seeing a lot of this going on. \n\nBut if you rip your daughter's world apart by taking away the woman you allowed to raise your daughter, she will hate you. She will not get  over it. Ever. You might ought to consider talking with a therapist on how best to handle this, because your focus will need to be on your daughter, not your pride.", "OP has commented that she has daughter every other weekend while father has primary custody. Aunt is the primary caretaker and primary mother figure in this girl's life. It sounds like the kid is closer to aunt than OP and prefer aunt to be her mother figure. \n\nJust because OP gave birth doesn't mean she's a good mother. For all we know, she wasn't in daughter's life all that much and is just jealous another woman has stepped up as a proper mother figure. \n\nOP only sees her own daughter 4 days a month and she didn't want to fight for custody, but her jealousy over another woman taking better care of her daughter suddenly makes her want to fight for custody? I don't think OP is faultless here.\n\nIf OP wanted more time with her own daughter she would have fought for it already. Now she's just using \"custody\" as a threat to throw a tantrum. TBH she sounds like those couples in a bitter divorce who fights for custody of the kid just to spite the other parent, and not because they actually want what's best for the kid.\n\nEDIT: So it seems this divorce happened when kid is 9 months old and this custody arrangement has been for the past *9 years*. Aunt is the only mother figure this girl knows. OP even states that she tries to \"free up a few hrs\" during her custody time to spend with her daughter but daughter says it's not good enough and \"Auntie is better because she plays with me\". Instead of spending more time with her daughter, OP threatens to take daughter away from her mother figure.\n\nSo OP only sees her for 4 days a month but actually only bothers to spend a few hrs during these 4 days with the kid. *OF COURSE* aunt is the de facto mother to the child. She raised the child from infancy. She might as well apply for adoption and make it official so we aren't here arguing over what's the appropriate title to call her.", "OP only has custody every other weekend and has said in comments she tries to set aside a \u201cfew hours\u201d during her custodial time to spend with her daughter. Meanwhile, aunt has raised this child with dad since the child was about 9 months old. Dad has primary custody. If the daughter views aunt as a parental \u201cmom\u201d figure because aunt is the primary caregiver, that\u2019s not parental alienation. That\u2019s attachment to the most present female figure in her life. If she calls her mom, that\u2019s the daughter\u2019s choice.", "OP has daughter every other weekend and father has primary custody according to OP's comments. \n\nYes I agree a 10yo is old enough to distinguish the difference of mother vs aunt and she has *chosen* aunt to be her mom because they have a closer relationship.

The child probably sees the sister as a step-parent, and the sister is filling that role. It's perfectly natural for this child to feel that this woman is her \"other mom\".\n\nPeople here are having difficulty with the fact they are not a couple but brother and sister. Doesn't matter. She could be a room-mate living there, and if she treats that child like her own, that child will feel like she's a mom- and call her mom.\n\nYes it's odd that a brother and sister are raising a kid together. It's unusual. But... what's wrong with it, other than the sorts of biases that are surely to come up in judgement against these people?\n\nI don't think the daughter is being coerced or manipulated into calling the sister \"mom\".\n\nAnd I think immediate calls to run to court are putting the ego of bio mom ahead of the needs of the child here and that's just very *gross.*", "This is not parental alienation. It's a mom who doesn't want to share title of mom with a de-facto step parent (woman) who is doing what millions of other step parents do every day: serve as mothers to other people's kids.\n\nThe fact is, there are two adults living in that house and both are serving parental roles despite not being in a sexual relationship with each-other. It's odd, but the sister is serving in a role that courts refer to as \"en loco parentis\" which is, \"in place of\" a biological parent.\n\nThe ex's sister is behaving like a mother and the child is calling her a mom for this reason. This really should not surprise anyone. My ex works with children and kids call her mom all the time - it's a term of endearment for a woman who *simply cares for you.*", "Am I missing part of the post?

She divorced her husband when the daughter was 9 months old and SIL stepped in to help him after the courts gave him primary custody.

But, SIL has been the biggest parent the child has known. If you have spent 90% of your life with your aunt, it is only natural that the child will consider her a mom as well. This is the issue.

They will not reduce a father's custody unless doing so is to the child's benefit. Based on the information you have provided I don't think you will win. The kid is 10 and obviously loves her aunt, she is not refusing to call you mum or exhibiting behaviour towards you that is aggressive, you have no evidence of neglect or abuse.

There is no demonization or lies being told, and there are no attempts to strip OP of her custody nor to keep the child from her.\n\nBy your logic, a child who decided to call their stepmother mom is somehow involved in parental alienation.", "> My point was there are lots of fathers who only see their children every other weekend and they\u2019re still dad!\n\nCan you point out where in the OP or the comments where OP states that their child does not call them mom?", "> I helped raise my sister's kid's, but I never once allowed them to call me mum, without correcting them.\n\nYou moved in and became the primary caregiver to your sister's kid for *10 years?*", "> life isn't pretty. \n\nYou're right.

No information as to why the custody is set up this way. This happens to men a lot where courts give primarily custody to the mom and give dads weekends in the same way.

The kiddo wouldn't be calling her mom if she wasn't encouraged to do so. \n\nI've seen a lot of posts of parents who had their kids young, kids were raised by the grandparents but they still knew their mom/dad was their mom/dad and grandparents were the grandparents even in a more formal parental role so it begs the question did they start it, encourage it, or simply not correct her when she said it and went along with a auntie mommy uncle daddy lol", "The fact that they think a kid calling another parental figure 'mom' is parental alienation is hilarious.

I'm not saying they are ACTUALLY incestuous but I am saying allowing kiddo to continue along that vein is weird.

To push for the biological title too \n\nWait, why is it a \"biological title\" if you admit that an adopted parent is a real parent? Also, we don't know that the aunt is \"pushing\" for anything. OP has assumed that...it could very well be that the kid sees SIL as her mom because SIL stepped up and acted like a real mom (versus her bio mom who shows up once in awhile but hasn't been a strong or reliable presence).", "> Using the correct names for everyone will mostly serve to leave the door open for OP to mend her relationship with her daughter over their lifetimes\n\nYou really think a kid is going to change their perspective on their near absentee mother because they called their primary female role model mom? People don't reconcile with their happily married biological parents *all the time*.", "I don't know how you can sit there and call other people obtuse while simultaneously acting like a 10 year old, who interacts with the outside world couldn't warm to the idea completely of their own volition to call their female parental caretaker \"mom\".", "Your daughter is 10 years old. She has a woman in her life looking after her who she has decided to call \"Mom\". She is close to her. However, she is aware that you are her mother. Why not just ask her how she sees you and how she sees her aunt? Her answer may make sense. Why create unnecessary drama calling up her aunt and yelling at her? Soft YTA.\n\nAs your daughter grows up, she will begin to distinguish between an aunt and a mom. Let it happen naturally. Make her visits fun and peaceful, something to look forward to. You will always be her mother. No one can change that. And if indeed the aunt and your ex are being manipulative, your daughter will figure it out with time. Just be her mom.", "INFO: Do you call her while she is there? How often?", "NTA. Go to court. This is already attempted alienation.", "NTA, but did you tell your ex this? Bc he's enabling this shit too.   \nGet more custody, your daughter does not need this kind of toxicity.", "I have to disagree with these people and say you are NTA. You are still in the kid life despite how often you have her. The SIL needs to respect boundaries and respect you as the mother as long as you are doing your part. IMO it is evil to confuse a childs mind like that. She is not the mother and she has to accept that. Its a very emotional gut wrenching feeling when you give your best, may not be the best to others but you are still standing. Explain to your daughter again. Speak politely one more time to SIL and apologize to be on the same page. She can pretend to be mom all she wants but when the kid grows up she will know the truth. If things dont change go to court. Make sure in the clause there is no bad mouthing on each side when the child is present. Everyone needs to respect everyone. Plus your Ex is TA he needs a fucking spine", "I disagree completely. When the mother is still in the picture, the daughter should not be calling her aunt, \u201cMom\u201d. My husband won primary custody of his son years ago. The mother (his ex) still lived in Charleston and had visitation ev other wkend and ev Wednesday. The child was 6 and asked to call me Mom. I told him that he would only ever have one Mom and it was good that we loved one another, but if he called me Mom, it would hurt his mother\u2019s feelings. He understood and continued calling me by my first name. His child psychologist at the time told me that had been the right decision. My stepson is an adult now. He is close to me and his mother (now). When he was 20, he thanked me for stepping back on that. His mother had already lost custody due to some actions of her own doing; but to take that title and rub salt in the wound wasn\u2019t going to help heal and move forward.", "Respected family members do not diminish other family members who their child loves dearly like you did with the nanny bs. You're sad and jealous and those feelings are fine, but never forget that this person treats your child well and that it's your relationship with your child that needs to be fixed in order for your kid to see you as mom.", "It is parental alienation", "We lived together.", "There's no evidence of it. OP never said that SIL told the daughter to call her \"Mom.\" And it's impossible to raise someone and take care of them every day without developing a parent-child relationship.

It's natural to be alienated from someone who has no real bond with you.", "And again, you were the primary caregiver for her child for 10 years? You actively filled the role of the primary caregiver in this child's life for a majority of her childhood from infancy? You were there 5 days a week, every week, without fail, because there was nobody else to watch the child outside of an occasional sitter?", "Why was it best for her?", "Okay, in Texas, it would be considered paretal alienation. I personally know the person that sued because of it. Maybe they just got the right judge..lol", "Yes. I wouldn't of mentioned it if it wasn't the case.", "She said she wasn't in a good place to be a parent when the daughter was a baby and at one point said the father had a better lawyer but also says she chose this setup. She didn't raise this kid and now it seems like she wants to do more...but she can't snap her fingers and expect to be \"Mommy.\" She can work at building a relationship, though she'll likely never replace the SIL in terms of importance. But even if she manages to force her kid to stop calling SIL \"Mom,\" it's not going to make the kid see OP as a real mom.", ">We don't know why? \n\nWe do know why. Or rather, OP is *remarkably unclear* on why.\n\nFirst it was the kid's dad had a better lawyer and more money.\n\nThen it was \"I wasn't in a position to raise my kid.\"\n\nThen it was \"I agreed to this custody arrangement.\"\n\nIf someone is being cagey about the actual reasons for their custody split, *and why they haven't attempted to have it adjusted in the subsequent 9 years*, they're probably hiding something negative about themselves.\n\nEvery one of OP's excuses sounds exactly like every deadbeat dad who claims the system is against them, while simultaneously never petitioning for more custody and never showing an interest in their children's lives.", "> This happens to men a lot where courts give primarily custody to the mom and give dads weekends in the same way.\n\nWhen men ask for even custody, they get it a majority of the time.", "You'd be surprised.", "But how is it parental alienation? Doesn't parental alienation mean that one parent is turning the kid against the other parent? All we've seen here is that the OP's daughter calls the SIL \"Mom.\" We don't know what SIL is doing or not doing...but we do know SIL has actually raised the kid. I'm pretty sure most judges would look at the situation and realize that. Any alienation happened because OP isn't a legitimate parent. Legally and biologically, yes, but emotionally she's not a real parent.", ">but she can't snap her fingers and expect to be \"Mommy.\" \n\nEven worse, there's no indication from the OP that her child doesn't call her mom.

I'd be even more surprised to see this same case not go to appeal and be completely reversed.\n\nOP might end up with some more custody, but she isn't getting primary.
