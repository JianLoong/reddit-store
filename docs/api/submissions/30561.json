You are protecting your wife and your new family (congratulations!) and doing the right thing here.\n\nI think you are right to cut off your mother, and when you do bring her back in your life, you need to assert some SERIOUS boundaries with her. She is never to hit, yell, make false accusations etc -- she is acting like a crazy toddler, and you are right, you need to focus on your wife and your baby now, and protect them both.", "NTA  \nI mean according to her own words, she'd not even her grandchild so why's she there huh?  \n\n\nSounds like your mother could do with a reality check that your wife and now your daughter are a part of your life and therefore a package deal. She can't hate your wife and make her life awful (esp. in one of her most vulnerable moments when she was being considerate) and then expect you to be fine with it.", "NTA. If she has keys to your house, change the locks. She needs to get the message that she can\u2019t insult your wife and expect you to accommodate her wishes. As your daughter gets older your mother is likely to make hurtful comments about her not being a boy or not being your child. Keep your mother away from your wife and child.", "Birth is not a spectator sport, nor is it an audience-participation event. NTA. And maybe hold off letting you mum meet the child until she learns boundaries and basic manners.", "Why did she have the means to get inside your house when you were not there?", "NTA, your mother is a bully. It is good you are putting the foot down because she will make life very difficult. Forget about the cousins etc, your priority is your own family now. Congratulations on your daughter and also it is your job to protect your daughter from your mother's worst characteristics.", "She hit your wife. She should have been evicted from your life permanently then and there.", "NTA unless you let this woman continue harassing your wife. If you have to move, do it and don't share the information with anyone. If you have to get a ring doorbell so you can pretend to be out and your \"shy wife\" can just hide upstairs or in the garden, do it. Your mom is a nightmare and she will ruin your marriage.", "NTA and I\u2019d give yourself space (don\u2019t talk to them for a while)  from any family who wants to get in the middle.", "Your primary responsibility is to your wife and the well-being of your new family, especially considering the highly disrespectful and inappropriate behavior your mother has exhibited. Kicking her out of the delivery room was a decision made to protect your wife and child from unnecessary stress and discomfort, which was necessary given the history of your mother's behavior. Your family's opinions may vary, but your duty is to prioritize the comfort, safety, and peace of mind for your immediate family \u2013 your wife and newborn daughter. Setting boundaries to maintain a healthy and safe environment for them is not an act of being inconsiderate but a crucial step towards ensuring their well-being. It's crucial to prioritize their emotional and physical safety over external opinions in this sensitive time.", "NTA\n\nYour mother sounds like she should book an appointment with a psychiatrist asap. Or like she should really get back to her childhood and learn manners.", "Good lord you have done next to nothing to set appropriate boundaries.  You have brought this on yourself.  ESH", "The birth of a child, let alone the birth of your first child, is such a vulnerable time in a woman's life and in the life of a married couple.  It doesn't need multiple people in attendance, and sure as h\\*ll doesn't need someone who is insulting and abusive to your wife in attendance.  \n\nThank you for standing up for your wife.  NTA", "NTA, and you need to protect your wife and child. Your wife might be sweet and shy, but that's likely because she's a people pleaser, not because she's okay with it. I don't see how anyone could be okay with the way your mother treats your wife.\n\nYou need to lay some boundaries and set some ultimatums for your mum and stick to them if she breaks those boundaries. \n\n1: No more insulting your wife in any way, including, but not limited to accusing her of cheating.\n\n2: No more unannounced visits.\n\n3: No more showing up at your house when you aren't home.\n\nBreaking any of those rules will result in limited to no access to her grandchild and/or you reporting her for harassment.\n\nNone of this is normal and there's no such things as grandparents having rights to see their grandchildren or even their own children once they're adults.\n\nYour don't want your daughter growing up with the attitude your mum is showing, and you definitely don't want her around people who will critise and insult her mother.", "nta", "tell all of the how your mother behaves. block anyone that does not apologizes instantly. NTA", "Nta", "The fact that she has hit your wife, disrespected both of you with false accusations, should be enough. I'm so sorry this is happening to you, but your mother sounds unwell at the most, a bully at best, but either of those should not be near you or your wife or child at this moment.\n\nThe question I have for you OP, what good has your mother done for you for the past few years? What has she helped with, given you, how has she supported you etc?", "Right? We ARE talking about the kid that can't be her grandchild because DiL had to be cheating because it wasn't a boy (which, the logic of that escapes me)?\n\nMiL sounds as if there's an untreated mental health issue in play. I wouldn't let her anywhere near my wife or child until it's treated-she sounds unhinged and could be dangerous, especially if she believes the child isn't her son's.\n\nNTA and protect your family."]}
