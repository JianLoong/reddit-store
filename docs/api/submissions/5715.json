Very conservative, don't believe in evolution, you get the idea. They (my aunt and uncle in their 50s and my cousins 14m and 16f) were visiting me, my parents and my grandma (who lives with us) for Christmas.   \nTo add some backstory - I remember this one visit to my aunt and uncle when I was \\~around 12 years old when my aunt made a comment on some girls wearing sorta revealing clothes. Something along the lines of \"if only they were aware of the thoughts they are causing men to have\". I didn't realize how fucked up that is back then but I randomly remembered again a few years ago and have since started wearing short skirts whenever I see them. Nothing obscene - skirts that are totally appropriate for everyday wear but enough to piss off my aunt. \n\nToday was the same, I was again wearing a short checkered skirt with sheer black tights and a rather baggy jumper - definitely nothing sexy or provocative. I got the usual disapproving glances from my aunt when they arrived at our place but today things went differently.   \nA few minutes later while people were getting settled in the living room, my aunt approached me when I was briefly in my room where other people couldn't hear us. She told me that I should change out of my skirt into something more modest since my male cousin was starting to be \"at that age\" and that I shouldn't give him \"bad thoughts\". I told her that I would continue wearing what I'm wearing and went back to the living room. Seems like my aunt then approached my dad in the kitchen to make me change and they started fighting. To make a long story short - other people became involved, things were heated and my relatives left shortly after. \n\nMy dad is fully on my side, especially since we're not just talking about random men but my *relatives*. My mom however thinks that while it is not ok to imply that the way women dress is somehow relevant to what thoughts men have about them, I should have just changed to keep the peace and respect my relatives' religious beliefs.

She's the AH by thinking the responsibility over men's thoughts lie on the women. Men need to be taught, from an early age, to respect body autonomy and your aunt is failing at teaching him that.

You're entitled to wear what you like, what you were wearing wasn't indecent or revealing, and *if* her son has impure lustful thoughts at seeing a fair amount of covered leg on a relative of his, well, just maybe the problem is him and particularly his upbringing that's given him a weird relationship with other people's bodies...\n\nNTA in the slightest.", "NTA. Those religious beliefs that your aunt has are toxic and misoginistic by nature. At the core, they indicate that men aren't able to control their thoughts or actions towards woman. \n\nThey tell women that if they dress a certain way, they are immoral or should be ashamed. \n\nThey form a baseline for victim blaming when men do attack women \"well what was she wearing\". \n\nAt the end of the day, you are not responsible for your cousin's thoughts or actions. \n\nI'm all for respecting people's beliefs.

You wouldn\u2019t be an asshole without the tights, but you even HAD the tights. I\u2019m always so weirded out when people imply family members are aroused by other family members.

It sends a terrible message to everyone that YOU would need to make a change so that someone else doesn\u2019t have \u201cbad thoughts.\u201d  Why perpetuate the notions that men cannot control themselves and that their sexual desires exist because women in \u201crevealing\u201d clothes make them have such thoughts.  \n\nAlso, if your mom wants someone to \u201ckeep the peace,\u201d she should ask your aunt to keep her thoughts to herself or else let it go.  \n\nFinally, your outfit sounds really cute. \n\nGood on you and your dad for standing your ground.\n\nEDIT TO ADD:  Next time, maybe ask your aunt why she isn\u2019t nearly as concerned that she thinks her son might want to bang his cousin.

Your aunt more than you, but still.\n\nDon't get me wrong, what you did is delishishly petty and I love it. It's silly to say skirts are causing impure thoughts or something. It's straight up victim blaming and I hate it.\n\nbut you're asking if you're an a hole, and being petty or spiteful is an a hole thing.

I wear quite conservative clothes and long skirts because it's a cute style, I'm a bit prudish and I hold certain (non-Christian) religious beliefs. The third is a clear third in priority. Why should you respect your aunt's aunt's religious beliefs when she is unwilling to respect your autonomy? The latter might not be held as a dearly treasured religious belief in itself, but it is rooted in the ultimate autonomy of the self, which is just as precious and should be just as treasured. You could maybe concede to your mom that doing so would have kept the peace, but every action in this sequence of events is on your aunt choosing to initiate. She is not a slave to her religious beliefs; she is a human being endowed with choice and she made the choice to break the peace.", "Nta. My god your aunt is SUPER CREEPY. Why would she make it anything sexual at all!!! Good on your dad for defending you! Anyone sexualising my child, especially a family member, would immediately be out", "NTA. Does her son know she thinks of him as a brainless animal that would hump your leg when in heat or something? You're his cousin ffs. Also it's not your responsibility if every short skirt he sees leaves him hot and bothered which,again,is just in your aunt's mind for now. She's sexist towards both women and men - women aren't obligated to restrict their clothing to what wouldn't cause men to think about sex and men aren't terrible monsters that would rape their cousins because of a relatively short skirt.", "I've never understood their mental gymnastics on this one. \n\nMen are superior but also can't control their own thoughts around skin???

That may not change much as it\u2019s still a bit petty, and I bet there are times she definitely goes over to aunt\u2019s with the short skirt, but to me there is something slightly more irksome about being asked to change in your own home.", "I get your point\u2014and if OP had chosen to wear really skimpy clothing, like a skirt with her butt hanging out or a loose deep v-neck with no bra, I\u2019d be more inclined to say she was going out of her way to antagonize her aunt and therefore was at least partly an AH.  But it doesn\u2019t at all sound like that here.  So, NTA for me", "This is the correct answer.\n\nOp isnt asking if she is ta for wearing a skirt. She isnt asking if her aunt is misogynistic.  She isnt asking if women should be able to wear what she wants. \n\nShe is asking : i put a piece of clothing specifically to make someone mad, is it ok ? No, its not, they were probably other ways to act on what her aunt was doing.", "Fair; I am basing most of my judgment on the title and the use of the Word \"Spite\".\n\nI think a justified a hole can easily be a Not the A hole in many situations. And someone pointed out that this happened in her own home, not her aunt's like I initially assumed.  I think OP is absolutely a Justified A hole, and it comes no where near as big an A hole as her aunt."]}
