Your aunt chose to destroy the peace for her religious views. Your body is yours to clothe however you want.", "NTA. What do people like this think men do at beaches or swimming pools? Somehow, they manage. \n\nAlso, I have to know if you wore a long jacket.", "NTA Your relatives ruined Christmas by attempting to impose *their* religious beliefs and practices on people who don't share them.\n\nAlso they are just wrong. Their is nothing a woman can wear or not wear that will prevent a man from having sexual thoughts about her if he is so inclined. I remember a story of a Iranian man arguing with a woman wearing a full burka that she was insufficiently modest because his 'passions were being inflamed' by the glimpse of half an inch of skin on her neck where the burka fastened. \n\nMale lust is a male problem - best dealt with by keeping their thoughts to themselves and ensuring their behaviour is decent and respectful.", "It\u2019s scary to hear this. Is the aunt is teaching the cousin that he cannot control himself by extension?  And that he is justified is unsavory thoughts and actions when a woman dresses a certain way?  Frightening.", "NTA I grew up in a Mennonite home. My mom is the aunt. I have large boobs that very few shirts can contain. I give 0 shits about my family's opinions. I now have children I breastfeed without thought in public.\n\nMy mother's face is hilarious. (She's loosening up and adapting to me)", "Mom is AH too for \"wanting to keep the peace\". Not having her daughter's back about a basic human right is disgusting. It makes me wonder is mom low level agrees with aunt.", "What the fuck?", "Yeah, my girls GRADE SCHOOL disallowed spaghetti strap shirts because it's a \"distraction\" to the male teachers? Like WTAF?!? These kids are 10 and under!", "If men are having lustful thoughts about you, they should gouge out their own eyes. That's what Jesus said.", "NTA", "NTA, you and your dad are based.", "NTA and honestly that verdict doesn't need any explaining. Brownie points to your dad too! Go him! Go you!", "NTA!!!\n\nYour aunt was being creepy, misogynistic, and wildly inappropriate.", "Your house...", "OP is NTA and I bet Auntie has banjo music on repeat", "NTA. Your aunt\u2019s extreme religious beliefs have made her batshit crazy!", "NTA, if she's worried about your male relatives, she either has a filthy mind or someone should call the police.", "nta. Aunt is jealous she could never pull them off...Plus why should woman have to cover up if men can control themselves? Esp a family member, thats gross.", "NTA. Next time this happens, refer your aunt to Matthew 18:9.", "NTA.  Where in the Bible does it say \u201cno short skirts\u201d?"]}
