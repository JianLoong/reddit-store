My brother (28 M) and I are pretty close, but have really massive fights here and there that lead us to not talk for months at a time, but we typically agree to squash things and go back to hanging out like buds again.\n\nMy brother and I were streaming on Twitch today playing video games from our childhood and having a great time. We were drinking and smoking like we normally do when we hang out so nothing crazy, just chilling and enjoying our day off of work. My bf had to come pick something up he left at my brother place after he got off work.\n\nWhen my boyfriend arrived he greeted me with a peck on the lips and a couple of pats on my behind like he normally does. He decided to stay a chat for a few minutes then decided to leave. While he was at my brother place, he and I sat on the edge of my brothers bed and talked (he lives in a studio apartment so there\u2019s not much seating). I didn\u2019t think anything of it. I gave him a peck on the lips again and he patted me on the behind again, then he left.\n\nAs soon as the door closed, my brother turned to me infuriated and said he doesn\u2019t want us making soft core p*rn in his house and making out on his bed and the next time my bf disrespected him by grabbing my ass in front of him he would knock him out. I kind of laughed in shock and asked if he was serious. He demanded I look him in the eyes and said he was dead serious. I was stunned.\n\nI can\u2019t even remember the last time my bf and I \u201cmade out\u201d. Again, we\u2019ve been together for 6 years. Making out usually only happens in the heat of the moment at this point and it\u2019s very rare. We certainly would never do it in front of anyone, let alone my brother. We do love each other and are affectionate with each other, but not to the point where it should make anyone uncomfortable. We would act the same way we did in front of my brother at a mall or grocery store. I see literally nothing wrong with it. It just feels like my brother is over-sexualizing everything I do with my bf and it\u2019s making me uncomfortable.\n\nI decided to go home and he sent both my bf and I texts doubling down and saying we\u2019re both being disrespectful and even going as far as to say to my bf that he understands \u201cwomen get h*rny when they drink\u201d but its my bfs job to handle me \u201cwhen im like that\u201d. This made me want to puke. I was not h*rny at all and it\u2019s weird as f*ck that my brother would even think of me like that.\n\nI literally have the clip from Twitch of this going down and I keep replaying it to see if I missed something, but I can\u2019t for the life of me find us doing anything that could be interpreted as inappropriate.\n\nTLDR; am I the asshole for showing mild affection to my bf in front of my brother because it makes him uncomfortable for some reason? And am I the asshole for thinking my brother is over sexualizing me because of this?\n\nEdit: Please feel free to review the clip yourself here https://www.reddit.com/r/infuriatingasfuck/comments/13gtls0/aita/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1", "created_utc": 1684015619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gu7b4/aita_for_showing_mild_affection_to_my_bf_in_front/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All he would have needed to do was ask you to refrain from any physical contact with your bf while at his house.\n\nThird, yeah, it's creepy af that he talked about you being horny when you're drunk.\n\nSounds to me like he's been cheated on by a girl when she was drunk and he's got some pent-up resentment going on.

You did nothing wrong here. I wonder why your brother is so sensitive about seeing affection and where his ideas about women getting \u2026. When they drink \ud83e\udd14 Is he neurotypical?", "NTA, not even close. This may seem like an odd question, but did you two grow up with parents/family that didn't display any pda? \n\nWhen I went to college, I was lucky enough to stay with an aunt that lived nearby. Whenever her boyfriend was around, I tried to respect their privacy and gave them space. Then one day my aunt asked why I disliked her boyfriend so much. I was shocked to hear her ask that. \n\nHere's the thing, my parents basically hated each other during my teen years. I didn't see them show each other any affection. This caused me to feel like I was intruding during even the mildest display of intimacy. Fortunately, my aunt figured out the cause of my discomfort during our conversation. She reassured me I wasn't intruding at all. I made a point to stick around after that, and eventually I stopped feeling so awkward. I later learned my viewpoint at that time is rather common. \n\nHowever, even *if* that explains the underlying cause for your brother, it sure as fuck doesn't excuse his misogynistic tirade. I can see why you go months without talking to him. My own brother flipped out when I brought around a guy. He at least knew his life would be forfeit if he implied a man should get me under control. That's top tier asshole right there.\n\nThe only reason I bring up a possible underlying cause (which may not even be close to applicable) is because it might help you have a conversation with him when you try to reconnect after months of silence (might I suggest years instead?). Quietly burying the hatchet only helps to continue a dysfunctional cycle. Something needs to change.", "NTA.  Your brother's reaction is over the top and, frankly, weird.   My guess would be that he was uncomfortable thinking of his sister in a sexual context, but that's a him problem.  You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother is objectifying both of you and his behavior is disgusting.", "your brother sounds single as fuck, that was such a mild greeting between lovers lol that was so casual and nonchalant and not even remotely sexual like....has this guy had a partner before? any chance he's jealous and incelling out?", "Your brother is dangerous. This ideas and sentiments he is expressing are dangerous. Time to go low to no contact OP.", "NTA, but you should have a polite adult conversation together about it. Your brother is wrong for the way he said it, but not for being uncomfortable seeing his sister involved in some level of PDA. I can't say I'd ever be comfortable with being greeted by my SO in public with a pat on the butt, so what you see as a peck on the lips might be more like a deep kiss to me. Everyone has their own comfort level with being involved in and viewing PDAs, so if you want to hang out with your brother again, you need to get on the same page, or you'll be in the same argument again.", "I feel my IQ has gone down 30 points from watching that clip. All of you need to brush up on your language skills.\n\nNTA. Your brother is very immature.", "ESH, slapping ass in front of family members is awkward and weird.\n\nBut your brother also sounds like a misogynist so, there's that.", "Probably going to get downvoted for this, but . . .\n\nYTA, and I don't trust that you're a reliable narrator. \n\nI'm pretty old, and have seen more than I care to admit, and I've literally NEVER seen anyone greet their SO with \"a few pats on the butt\" while kissing that wasn't actually an honest-to-goodness grope.\n\nPeople don't just pat each other \"politely\" on the ass while giving a \"peck\" hello. Especially multiple times. That's . . . not a thing. Especially because an actual \"peck\" lasts a fraction of a second. \n\nIf your BF was \"patting\" you on the ass multiple times, I'm guessing that the affection wasn't nearly as \"mild\" as you're making it out to be, through anyone's eyes but yours. Doesn't mean that it was deeply inappropriate, but it does mean that you need to be aware that when someone expressed discomfort with the level of PDA, that's legit, and it's pretty gross to dismiss them. More importantly, if you're literally making someone else uncomfortable with your PDA that they're asking you to please tone it down, then turning around and saying, \"I'm uncomfortable with your accusations, you're SEXUALISING ME\" is pretty skeevy DARVOing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
