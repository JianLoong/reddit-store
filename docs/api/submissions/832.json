Still doesn't make you an AH, but it's weird.", "NTA, but agree with the idea of therapy. I don't think holding onto someone's clothes after they've passed is weird, but if I were dating you, I'd be creeped out if you offered to let me wear them. Sure, they're nice, but they obviously have value to you that goes beyond the bounds of casual into more symbolic.", "NAH.\n\nTwo things can be true at the same time:\n\n1. Your mother's clothes and accessories bring you joy and fond memories of your mother, which is totally understandable given the circumstances.\n2. The situation is very UNUSUAL, which is just another word for WEIRD.\n\nYour GF is trying to understand if there is room in your life for HER.  She feels as is she is competing with your mother's memory for your attention.  You suggesting she dress up AS YOUR MOTHER doesn't help her feel better at all.\n\nYour GF wants you to like the way SHE dresses.  You don't have to throw out your mother's things, but you certainly should be able to put them away and not bother your GF with them.  It would probably be better for you all around if you maybe kept a few things and donated the rest.", "NTA. But I would definitely recommend some therapy. It's very normal for those that have lost loved ones to hold on to certain belongings such as jewelry, however you are holding on a bit too tight. These articles of clothing seem to have a hold of you. I would agree with your girlfriend, when you mentioned she could wear your mothers clothes. That's bordering on some Norman Bates vibes friend. Therapy can help ease this loss you still haven't gotten over.", "NAH but get some therapy. Keeping a few things is one thing, but this is impacting your relationship and you should interrogate this further.", "NTA, that is how you remember your mother. How many items of clothing are we talking and how many does she want to give away. If it is taking up a lot of space it is reasonable for her to suggest or politely ask for you to get rid of a \"few\" items, not all of them.", "Don't throw those items away, they are a part of your history and have sentimental value. Throw out the girlfriend instead. NTA", "NTA for wanting to hang on to a few things for sentimental reasons.  But if you have closets full of her clothes it's time to do a major purge.", "NAH\n\nI wouldn't consider what you're doing bad, but I'm not sure I would consider it healthy either.  One or two pieces that you hang /display as remembrance of your mother is one thing, her entire wardrobe is another.  Have you been to a therapist to work through the grief of losing your mother?", "INFO: did the suggestion that she wear your deceased mom's clothing come before or after the general conversation about her finding it weird that you keep these things?", "NTA - These are your prized possessions and if your gf thinks they are creepy then she can beat it.", "NTA\n\nPeople grieve differently.  You may want to speak with a grief counsellor to help you process your grief, but there's nothing inherently wrong or creepy with what you're doing.  I would say don't mention your gf wearing the stuff again if it bothers her, but her suggestion that you should just get rid of the things if you don't want to is really inappropriate and insensitive.", "NTA but I think it's time to realise your Mum is not in those things. They're just things. You won't stop remembering her or thinking of her if you got rid of them. I'd maybe keep one item and give the rest to charity/goodwill if they're still in good condition. Let her things help other people who might be struggling with money.\n\nAnd please don't ask your gf to wear your deceased mother's clothes. That's a bit Norman Bates.", "NTA \n\nAs long as these items are being kept somewhere safe and out of the way and you're not begging your girlfriend to wear any of it, I don't see anything wrong with keeping the clothes and shoes. She can have her feelings about what you keep from your deceased mother but ultimately these are your possessions and they come with a lot of memories", "NTA and don\u2019t get rid of your moms stuff!! It has sentimental value to you and it\u2019s something you can hold onto to help her memory carry on. If you decide to have kids in the future and have a little girl, having those clothes will mean the world to them as well as yourself. \n  \nWhen my grandma died, she left me a beanie baby with sentimental value and a ring of hers I cherish so deeply. I knew her and it\u2019s super important to me so if you have a child that never got to meet her it\u2019ll mean even more to them. \n  \nEven if you don\u2019t have kids, if they mean something to you then keep them. It seems very unfair of her to tell you it\u2019s creepy when clearly she\u2019s never lost a parent and doesn\u2019t seem to understand the sentimental value. Plus if they were expensive that\u2019s even more reason to hold onto them since their value will only increase potentially (as if you need more justification than them meaning something to you). \n  \nNot creepy at all, don\u2019t get rid of them, and maybe ask your gf what her issue is with it because it sounds like a her issue she\u2019s projecting", "NTA your girlfriend is though. Sure about her? Lots of people keep clothing of their passed family members. There's nothing weird with that. We have my grandma's in her closet as well. They aren't on display or causing an issue. Its nice though to look through them now and again and remember the pieces they loved to wear and moments they wore those. I wear some of her clothes now (took them home), too. Others in the family and friends did as well. It's a nice way to be close to her still. Your girlfriend sounds super insensitive.", "NAH. And I also think it\u2019s important to you because that is a bonding experience you did together. I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s healthy or not like others have mentioned, but I understand it. When the time comes you have to make those decisions, maybe see if someone can make keepsakes for you. When my grandma passed she left behind hundreds of shirts, pants, and other items. We had them made into several quilts for our family.", "NTA- \n\nI was a single mom to my son for a long time and he would often pick out my attire and even my jewelry.\n\nI\u2019ve had cancer and survived a terrible car accident. \n\nMy son has asked, that in the event something happens to me, that he receives all my jewelry and my collection of vintage coats, scarves, and a few sentimental pieces of clothing. It\u2019s not strange at all. \n\nOffering to let her wear it, that probably crossed the line for her and you might want to rethink that in the future.", "NTA. DO NOT THROW THESE AWAY. You might have a daughter one day and you\u2019d hate yourself if they couldn\u2019t be passed down.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s being callous. She doesn\u2019t get to pick and choose what objects you inherit have sentimental value.", "NTA. These belongings are a link to your mother, that should be respected and treasured. Don't get rid of a single item. The GF however, rethink her.", "NTA at all. That\u2019s your mother\u2019s clothes, who passed away and this is how you remember her. It\u2019s completely normal to hold onto clothing or anything of a deceased loved one. I have a t-shirt of my dad\u2019s who passed away 7 years ago, and it was turned into a stuffed shirt like a pillow. I also have some pieces of clothing we still have of my dad.\n\nHow I view this, is your gf has never gone through grief or doesn\u2019t understand the significance of the clothes, or she\u2019s trying to see if she can pawn off the clothing since you mentioned how your mother dressed. Not saying your gf is like this, but we don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s been your gf so that is where my mind goes to.\n\nPlease make sure your mother\u2019s clothes and possessions are somewhere safe where your gf can\u2019t get to them, I\u2019d be worried if she tried to get rid of them anyway. Better safe than sorry if she ever tries something- I\u2019ve seen people get very weird about deceased people\u2019s stuff whether they were close to said person or not.", "INFO needed, I think. Do you have a place to keep these clothes and accessories, or are they eating up your storage/living space? Do you still have ALL of them, or have you just picked out some pieces that are meaningful to you?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with keeping mementos that remind you of someone you loved, but it's easy to sometimes transfer your feelings from the person you loved to the things you have left, and place an undue importance on them. Assuming you have a storage place for these items and you've kept a reasonable amount, it doesn't sound like there is anything creepy or questionable about what you have done, but if it is beyond those parameters, you may want to re-evaluate. Also, I'm wondering if your girlfriend feels like your attention to the items and then asking her to wear them is transferring some of your feelings for your mother onto her? I think I might feel that way if I was offered to wear the clothes of another woman that my partner had loved dearly - it would be uncomfortable. Your offer may have come from a good/generous place, but I can see how it might not have been taken that way, and you might want to talk to your girlfriend about it.", "NAH\n\nHow you process your grief is personal to you, but....holding onto everything doesn't sound healthy and I agree with your gf that it's a bit creepy (Norman Bates vibes)  I think you should talk to a therapist about it.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

Wont lie. This is weird. Not keeping her clothing but suggesting she wear them snd the comparisons to you mom. I will say though, be careful about the house and that its in good order.

It\u2019s not AT ALL weird or unusual (to keep the clothes, asking her to wear them is weird).\n\nIt\u2019s completely normal to have personal keep sakes from a loved one who has died.\n\nIf my mom had died when I was a kid I absolutely would keep a lot of her clothes until the day I died.\n\nYour gf lacks compassion and lacks love, and is unfortunately quite judgemental.

You find straight men who have interests in womens fashion offputting.", "NTA. does she feel jealous that u aren't giving her those cloths or something?? she's demanding to get rid of clothes thats not even in your direct possession, lol she is a red flag.", "She\u2019s trying to assert her dominance over OP by making OP throw out precious family memories.

These are expensive family hairlooms potentially.\nI hope to pass down some of my designer items to my daughters, so since these are expensive designer clothes I think it's actually quite nice of OP to let his girlfriend wear some of them if she wishes.\n\nHe hasn't asked her too.

I don\u2019t even think they\u2019d say shit if it was a gay man. This is that really deep, hard to pin down, sometimes subtle kind of misogyny that truly effects everyone.
