She's really bitter her mother won't retire and babysit the kids for free, but her mother is only in her mid 50s and can't afford to retire yet. She constantly complains she can't travel or enjoy her life anymore because she doesn't have a village. \n\nAfter years of this, I told her I'm actually really glad we have moved away from that because \"the village\" that parents romanticise was actually the unpaid labor of women, and as a woman who doesn't want a child, I'm glad that I'm no longer considered socially obligated to babysit other people's kids for free or do household chores for people who chose to have kids in my free time, especially because these people won't pay it forward to me in any way, and if something happened to me, like getting really sick and needing help, they'd use their kids as a reason they can't help me. I also reminded her that \"the village\" depended on women not having jobs and it is a good thing that women can now sustain themselves and aren't forced into dependency on their fathers or husbands. \n\nThe thing that triggered it was that I went overseas recently for a holiday and to attend a concert of an artist I really like and she complained about how she doesn't get to to these things because \"the village\" is off doing things like that.\n\nShe said I'm just a really selfish childfree person who wants mothers to \"suffer\", but I don't think I was wrong, and then she said I was a bad feminist and a terrible person and hasn't spoken to me since.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698692592, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k0v67/aita_for_telling_my_friend_with_kids_that_im_glad/", "score": 9703, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having children with the expectation that other people will raise them for you is one of the most entitled narcissistic delusions you can have, imo. \"The village\" works when EVERYONE comes together to help everyone out through mutual understanding and for mutual benefit; the men provide and protect, and the women forage and child-rear. \"The village\" is NOT \"Hey take my kids for a weekend cause I want to go party and get blackout drunk\" or \"I want a vacation without my kids so I'm going to dump them on So-and-So for a week.\"\n\nEdit: spelling", "ESH. \n\nThe village isn\u2019t unpaid female labor to give parents free time to go to concerts and vacation.

You had no need to confront her on this, and injected phantom sexist meaning into the phrase only makes it worse. Separately, how would you feel if in 30 or so years, when you\u2019re wanting somebody to take of you, this same friend said something unnecessary hurtful and snide like \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re lonely, it\u2019s the payback for those years of\nEnjoying the world while I was stuck at home not living my life\u201d or some equality unnecessary, hurtful thing?\n\nSo basically, she has no reason to complain, and your screed is wrong on the meaning of the quote, unnecessarily sexist, and rude for no reason.

I say this as a parent: having your own biological kids is the most selfish, self-indulgent thing any human being can do, and I think we parents should acknowledge this.  We literally create mini-mes in our own image and expect the world to bend around us and our kids.  My kid is my world, and I adore him beyond compare, and I hope he will go into the wider world and try to make it a better place, but I'm under no illusions that my part in his creation, however difficult it was for me (pregnancy is awful and permanently alters your health), it was still a self-indulgent act.\n\n(I think it's a different thing for adoptive parents. )\n\nThere's nothing \"selfish\" about being child free.

She made a choice to be a parent and is regretting that and envious that you and others aren\u2019t tied to the responsibility she chose.", "ESH. Your friend sounds like an exhausting complainer who wants things done for her. Especially calling people selfish. Like, you had a hid. Take care of it. \n\nBut, at least in my culture and upbringing, your perception of \u201cthe village\u201d is a little off base. I personally think that it\u2019s incredibly important for children to be supported by different people. This is not in place of the parents, as your friend seems to be thinking, but in support of them. Time with grandparents is very important, so is time with other extended family. I do agree with your friend that American society has trended toward parents being kind of alone in upbringing and it makes me scared to have kids here. Where I am from and how I grew up, we were always around other people. My parents had a big group of friends who had kids around the same age. We would always go out together, go on vacations together. The \u201clabor\u201d was diffused in that way. The kids entertain themselves, the adults get adult time, things are supervised. I was with my grandparents all the time (and they LOVED it). I was with my aunt, my uncle, my cousins. Even other family friends who didn\u2019t have kids but just liked having me over for a sleepover (like a surrogate grandma lol). I think this kind of social net is really beneficial for kids to grow up in. As you get older, kids alternate where the sleepover is and the parents get a break. It\u2019s important for parents to have some alone time and for kids to be alone away from them sometimes too! Otherwise, you risk super dependent children. \n\nAll this to say, yeah she sounds annoying. I\u2019m not sure why you hang out with someone who complains all the time and thinks you\u2019re selfish. But your view of village isn\u2019t how I see it/how a lot of other people see it. I don\u2019t have kids, btw. But I love kids and I love helping out my friends and family when they need it. I would never flat out expect that from anyone if I did have a kid though.

She's not an asshole for ranting about all the things she can't do, although it is a bit assholish to do it in such a pointed way considering OP just went on a vacation. Having a baby and a toddler is being in the trenches and it is really hard to relate when you are not there. I look back on how I was when my sister and friends had kids before I did and I was not there for them because I did not get it at all. I figured they'd ask for help if they needed it and they would want time alone as a family. When they disappeared I figured they were in their happy little family bubble rather than the truth, which is that they were isolated in sleep deprivation hell. \n\nOP is not an asshole for not wanting to be the village because she's not in the phase of life. Maybe this whole blow up could have been avoided if Bella felt her rants were received with empathy (\"Mothering babies and toddlers is exhausting, and women mostly suffer in secret, I feel for you\") but the fact that it didn't just kind of shows Bella and OP aren't really in compatible phases of life to maintain a close friendship.", "NTA.  Wow, the village, really?  She is interpreting that phrase pretty literally, isn't she?  How someone could think that others are at standby waiting to jump in and assist in this day and age is beyond me.  Maybe she was too young to have kids and never got the chance to do what? - have fun, party, travel?  Oh well, you make your bed you must lie in it with no help from the village.  The part that kills me is the guilt-tripping she is hoisting on you for living your life.  Yeah, the last thing I want it to be roped into taking care of the other village kids.

They had free, nearly unlimited childcare from their depression-era parents - the generation who worked their assess off to make a better world for their children. This allowed boomers to go to school, build careers, and go on vacations largely unencumbered by the burdens of domestic life and childcare. Now that their own kids are grown though, they're spending their retirement buying vacation homes and playing golf, meanwhile Gen-Z and millennials are perma-renters working multiple jobs with an alarming level of burnout. Many boomers see their grandkids maybe once or twice a year, and only if it's convenient. This isn't hyperbole - I've witnessed this with my own parents and heard this sentiment MULTILPLE times in many different parenting and relationship forums. \"Why are our boomer parents like this\" is such a common theme it's become a trope. \n\nSomeone in another thread put it best - the boomers didn't expect *grandparents* to raise kids, they expected *someone else* to raise their kids. It would never be their turn. They were absent, emotionally distant parents, and now they're the same type of grandparents. The concept of a village doesn't even exist because it's something they only ever took from, not gave back to, and that's why younger generations feel stranded. That's why we aren't giving them grandbabies, or if we do it's when we're well into adulthood ourselves. Because we're doing it all on our own.\n\nEdit: Obligatory not all boomers, but way too many of them (especially those skewing white middle class)", "Honestly having someone babysit so that you can go do something you really want to do isn't a huge deal.

That's a fair criticism.\n\nBut not having a Village is a relatively, extremely new method of child rearing that has come about from modern Western society's obsession with the nuclear family and putting people to work, not from choice and freedom. For eons, people have relied on the village to be both productive community members and successful parents, but then we all got forced into an economy that has demanded income earners across generations. Grandparents *can't* be grandparents because the retirement age keeps increasing right along with the cost of living. Support systems that did come from The Village were outsourced expensively to companies. This includes elderly care, too, not just children and parents.\n\nBasically, what society did was take away one support system without providing a meaningful replacement.\n\nI don't fault you or anyone for not wanting to take an active role in raising someone else's child.

My maternal aunt also hosted us in the quaint mountain town she lived, but it was  a given she would stay with us every time she came into the larger city we lived in. My father's sister-in-laws often provided childcare, but my mother dis the same with their children. Childless relatives, men and women, also babysat and provided for us children, but my parents were helping them in a variety of ways.

Many of the parents who bemoan the fact that they don't have a village seem to fundamentally misunderstand how it works.

It is not to make things easy on you (switching to a general \"you\" from here on out, not directed at the redditor I am replying to)\n\nI lived abroad in a rural village that followed this type of collectivist lifestyle.  So, when you had a baby, your neighbors would take care of all of your housework.  They would fetch water from the pump.  They would provide meals.  But, you would do all the same for them.  \n\nSomeone has to take their baby to the health clinic that is far away?  You will volunteer to take care of at least one of your children, no matter how busy you are with your own.  Your mother takes care of your children while you are working? It's a community, so you will obviously provide for her and take care of her in your own home once your father passes or is no longer able to provide for her financially.  \n\nIn most cases, you end up helping others as much as others help your, or even more.  And if that is the case, you will count yourself as lucky.  The people who get more than they give are those who have exceptionally difficult lives like those with disabilities, orphans, widows, etc.\n\nAlso, everyone helping you with your child means that they are involved in all different ways.  So, any village member can discipline your child.  They can borrow your kid to help with chores.  They can chastise you when they feel your parenting is inadequate. You are collectively raising the child and promoting the good of the community, so you have to defer to others. \n\nClearly, this is the village in the most traditional form, and parents are usually asking for something more in-between.  But, they need to understand that it is give and take.  It's not \"people help me with my kid, but since I am busy with my kid, I can't help them.\" It is \"I go out of my way to help my community however possible, and I know that others will help me when I need it.\" It's not \"people help me how I want them to and then they mind their own business,\" but rather \"our business is each other's business, so we handle it together\".", "Her amazing baby, duh!", "No need to completely end all friendships, but this particular one seems like it needs a couple of years on ice.", "I agree with you.\n\nI have a kid, and I feel the OP's friend is totally out of line to try to guilt trip people in to helping, and to assume they would automatically help anyways.

A parent working part time or being a SAHM/SAHP is more often than not the result of choice borne out of being able to maintain a good standard of living on one partner\u2019s income. In some regions, we\u2019re seeing one partner having no choice but to stay at home until the child is pre-K age and that\u2019s due to a lack of daycare spots (not affordable daycare spots, but a lack of spots in general). Yes, it tends to be women who will have to become the SAHP in those situations, but that decision isn\u2019t usually due to women being better suited to being the default parent, but to the wage gaps. Now, if you want to burn bras and protest about the lack of child care spots and the wage gap, I\u2019m your gal, I\u2019m all for it.

It\u2019s not about men being \u201cavailable\u201d to participate in the village. The point that u/Kingsdaughter613 made, and the one I\u2019ve reiterated/agreed with is that *men have abrogated much of their duty in the village*. Traditionally, \u201cthe village\u201d didn\u2019t refer to the unpaid labour of women: It referred to the unpaid labour of *every member of the village* to support every member of said village. \n\nAs a feminist, I have 2 choices: Either I go with OP\u2019s definition of the village, the one in which men play no role (so, really, might as well call it a nunnery/convent) or the traditional definition in which every member of the village/community puts their shoulder to the wheel. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m going with option 2. It\u2019s what *both* my parents have modeled and reinforced throughout my life. It\u2019s what I\u2019m now seeing them do as a 41yo woman with a dad with Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer (I wish I were kidding, it\u2019s now a great combo) where they\u2019re relying more on 2 of my uncles and a male friend/neighbor for most of their current/immediate needs. But mostly, the village worked. It **fucking used to work** (pardon my English), until men abrogated their duty in it and, *somehow*, in recent years, the village became the sole duty of women. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 not. The village is the village\u2019s duty. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s duty and it\u2019s to everyone\u2019s benefit.\n\n**Again**, I don\u2019t think OP is the asshole in her interpretation and role in **her specific** situation.

Of course sometimes (especially when there's a new baby) people need more help than they can reciprocate, but the people I will drop everything for and help are always the ones who are actually helpful to me when they can. \n\nI think OP sounds a little salty about all of this, but I think it's probably salt that comes from her friend expecting a lot without returning much even before she had kids. You probably knew, when your friend asked you to come help for a few days, that she wasn't going to get you to do all the work. If she was that type, you probably wouldn't have taken the week off work. I think if she was similar to OP's friend, you'd probably not have been able to find the time.", "Sometimes. Sometimes the kind caring people just constantly get taken advantage of and never get the help they need despite a lifetime of being kind and helping others. \n\nI wish the world worked for everyone in the nice caring way it does for your friend. Sadly, for some people, life and their village just lets them down.", "The west generally refers to NA and Europe, basically most of the global north/nato. Or at least that's what the person you replied to was describing.", "Selfishness started back during world war 2. Watch the docu series on youtube called \u201cthe century of self\u201d", "I know the majority of reddit is from white western countries but the village isn\u2019t a thing of the past. I had a village growing up and it\u2019s still a thing in a lot of non western countries. \n\nThe way we have \u201cfamily friends\u201d is a concept me and my spouse struggle to explain to people constantly but they\u2019re just one stop removed from literal blood family. Someone you would trust with your own life. People who come over and spoil your kids but also scold them because they\u2019re their \u201csecond parents\u201d. I honestly don\u2019t have the words to explain it.", "if we're talking olden olden days a lot of men's labor was related to tasks that feel invisible to us in modern times and that we also now associate with women. for example - a lot of the cutting and carving and slicing of meat is a task that's now done by butchers and sold to us in already partitioned units. men used to have to do a LOT of work to make flour - and now we only recognize flour in its final form.\n\nanother very basic concept that helps bridge the gap about the men in the village is simply the contrast between (1) getting a woman pregnant and disappearing and immediately resuming dating and eventually getting another woman pregnant vs (2) getting a woman pregnant and then remaining in a relationship and living situation with that woman. you could do any number of tasks (work, clean, mow the lawn, etc) and you'd still be a valuable part of the village - if for nothing directly related to childcare then simply freeing up the woman's time for childcare with your other tasks. \n\nthe point is just having both parents actively engaged in their family life and the 'village' being a natural bonding between engaged family units.", "Chores and helping the family is not parentification.", "I wasn\u2019t parentified but I had chores to do. Not all families parentified their kids while expecting them to help around the house. My stepmom did that with her 3 boys as well. They all took turns doing household chores including her and my father!"]}
