I would definitely do this.", "Omg!!! \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 I love this!!!", "Or just a happy face.", "Oh do this !!! Hilarious", "I had an uncle that churned through so many wives that my grandpa did just that. Each time uncle got married grandpa would take a photo of her, cut out her head and just tape it over a family wedding photo of the first wife\u2019s head. It became a running joke in the family for decades.", "Even I, with no photoshop experience whatsoever, could do that.  Of course, you may not want a photo with a large black ex-girlfriend-shaped blob in it...", "The fiance seems pretty reasonable to me. She wasn't mad Brother had a prior GF; she was mad it was a specific person and he wasn't honest about it. Brother is just trying to find a way to make it OP's fault, and is an AH.", "Oh yeah absolutely. Even requesting that *at all* is ridiculous. Money aside. If he had said \"Look I'll pay for it I'll even give you an extra $100 for your trouble.\" it'd *still* be ridiculous. Expecting OP to pay for it is just the icing on the cake.", "Ah. Well...in that case it sounds like the issue is that they dated at all and he wasn't up front about it, not that they're in the wedding photos. Still definitely not OP's problem nor is it a reasonable request to photoshop the wedding photos.", "Yeah, apparently, the ex-girlfriend had bullied the fiancee for years and bro hasn't been upfront about anything.", "Sure. Still not OP's problem nor is it reasonable to request that they photoshop the wedding photos. How does that even address the actual issue?", "Did OP's brother know that this specific woman is his gf du jour's 'nemesis'?", "The ex was a bully to the fiancee in middle school and high school. The issue isn't.that my brother dated other women. It's that he had a serious enough relationship with her that she was included in a family wedding picture. My brother is between a rock and a hard place.  He either has to admit he was an asshole for insisting she be in the pictures even though she was in his life for a few minutes or lie about how important to him she was.", "Yeah, yeah, NTA, whatever\u2026.\n\n\nEXPLAIN THE BEEF!", "Yeah, I also now need to hear the nemesis origin story, hah!", "This is exactly how a similar problem was solved in my family xD except for the cutout was an actress \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019d be petty and put the ex in MORE photos.", "I think they're factoring in the re-printing costs as well", "Erasing her from his memory is free and painless. Erasing her from your pictures is difficult and expensive.\n\nDoes his fiancee know about his history of casual dating?", "Right, but you\u2019re going to be on stage too, no matter what you do. That\u2019s how the dysfunction works. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m reading between the lines, and totally applying my own bias, but the drama and fighting was going to happen anyhow. You were going to be blamed no matter what. You could have left, or not even been there, and it\u2019s would STILL be your fault. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve lived that for decades, at some point you just go, you know what, fuck they all. You mitigate any real damage, as much as you can, but shit like this, that\u2019s just funny\u2026.. burn it down.", "I can at the very least see payment for the printing, and possibly the framing too.", "Because that would not have been suspicious at all? Nope you cannot look at all the pictures. You have to trust my brother is telling the truth when he says I randomly picked the only picture with his ex to print and display in my home.", "I was in this situation once. Boyfriend tried to insist I be in family wedding picture -- for an uncle I had never met. I'd only been dating this dude a short time and I knew he would not be endgame. So I politely declined. Afterwards he got all mad at me saying I \"embarrassed him\" yada yada. \ud83d\ude44 maybe your extended family doesn't want some rando in your family photos forever because YOU decided! \n\nI also feel like I accidentally did the same thing to my brother's gf recently. Whole family went on vacation and I wanted to get a family photo but didn't want to be like okay Jennifer you go stand over there now. So she kinda awkwardly offered to take the picture of the family and I took some of her and my brother just the two of them. No drama or anything (see how easy that is, Ex?)", "I was the boyfriend who was basically demanded to be in my ex's families pictures. I tried to refuse, but they insisted. I complied. We broke up a few months later. I tried to tell them...", "Lmao I love this \ud83e\udd23", "I'm laughing way too hard at this!  Please tell me it was old Gary and not young Gary.", "OMG could we start something here. Gary Busey  or maybe Samuel L Jackson  or etc is cut and pasted onto those exes who are no longer in the family.\n\nBut like Dave Chappelle's The Racial Draft everyone has to nominate one for their race. So then it becomes a shorthand. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z3wUD3AZg4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z3wUD3AZg4)\n\nYou're welcome. \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA. Edited to add the link and NTA.", "My aunt did exactly this with my brother\u2019s wedding photo\u2026she cut my ex SIL out \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "That funny. But probably could have avoided doing that by using a x-acto knife", "My best generational picture with my brother and cousins unfortunately had my cousin's ex in it.  Fortunately she was to the side, so Mom was just able to crop it.\n\nAren't professional wedding pictures more difficult?  I thought that they were actually imprinted on the pages and impossible to remove or change.", "On God, OP's brother sounds exhausting and not worth the hassle to accommodate. How did he insist on taking pictures with the nemesis ex, then bring over his fiancee to his sister's place where those photos are in the open for all to see?", "Of course it is not OP's problem and brother's request is totally ridiculous. I wanted to pinpoint that the issue of the current girlfriend is not just that she has discovered that her boyfriend has dated other women before her. This also confirms brother is stupid: he insisted to have his girlfriend of the week/month in a family picture knowing he has no issue dating women from the same circle and no basic courtesy...", "lmao your brother sounds like a catch \ud83d\ude02", "Just tell him you saw this coming and you warned him, none of this is on you, or your pocket. Tell your parents the same. It has to be his money or no change. If it doesn't sound fair to them, tell them to explain. Tell them you are giving them a chance to reason you into footing the bill of changing these photo frames.", "Wow! A mess of his own making!", "> My brother is between a rock and a hard place\n\nHardly. Your bro is just being a baby, in a mess of his own making. If he's ready to get married - as having a fiancee would suggest -, he is old enough to have \"difficult discussions\" with his fiancee and cope up to embarrassing truths. It's silly to expect you to pay to get your wedding pictures photoshopped just so he doesn't have to talk to his own fiancee, especially since that wouldn't even solve the issue.\n\nTell him to grow up. NTA", "What a dumb thing for her to be upset about.", "Oh that\u2019s a nemesis alright. I\u2019m loving this", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Also here for the nemesis origin story. It had better be good after her hissy fit \ud83d\ude02", "The biggest cost would be the editing. If they have high res images with a copyright release, they can get it printed at a prosumer lab for a few bucks for an 8x10 to something extremely reasonable for a larger size.\n\nSo the printing should not really be a factor unless they have some fancy framing done, which again, should be not very costly to have a print lab swap it out.", "If she didn't, odds are good she's scouring that history now.", "You could have said \"She was in quite a few photos back then\" and left it at that.  \n\nNot pulled out a whole album to giggle about, just to stoke the fire of this truly immature argument.", "When my ex graduated we had been together two years and were super happy. They wanted me in all the pics. I insisted on taking half the pics so I was only in half, and his dad was in half too.\n\nWe split a year later. Bet they're glad I'm a 'But what if...?' sorta person \ud83d\ude02", "Tell me I'm reading this wrong and she didn't cut THE BRIDE out of her own wedding photos lmao that is ridiculous", "My mom also did this with one of the photos from my wedding. To be fair, it's a really good picture of me that they'd had hanging up for a few years. The first time I visited them after my ex and I split up, they still had the picture hanging up but only the half with me in it. \n\nWe divorced because my ex started cheating on me with a good friend while I was working out of town for a couple of months and ended up getting pregnant. My parents knew that and they'd never really trusted my ex to begin with so my mom told me she got great pleasure out of cutting the photo of my ex in her wedding dress into tiny pieces and tossing them into the fireplace.", "In my opinion, I\u2019d refuse alterations even if someone else did pay for them to get changed. Too much hassle. SPECIALLY if I saw all this coming and was overruled.", "I think she\u2018s talking about the whole wedding album which can easily have up to 300 pictures and maybe some photobooks were printed etc etc\u2026 so yes the editing would take a lot of time and also the printing costs can be high enough to not want to pay for everything just because story above", "You're going hard on OP as opposed to their brother to be arguing this hard against someone showing their wedding album upon request as \"stoking the fire\". What an odd hill to die on for your poor argument.", "are you the brother or something? lay off it already. op is not in the wrong, and you are just making yourself look foolish", "Lol no they were family copies. Guess my aunt was bored one day and stumbled on it tucked away when she moved \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit\u2026yes, the bride. My brother was divorced less than three years in.", "Gotta love mom\u2026I\u2019m sure it was cathartic for her. I hope it was for you too. Sorry you had to go through that.", "Wait are you saying the family wants her to remove the ex from ALL the photos?? The album (likely) isn\u2019t even display, this is wiiiiiild", "This dude definitely got caught lying about something and had their family expose him in the past to be this mad at OP.", "No but like the ex in question was the BRIDE in those photos????", "Yep. She did a pretty good job\u2026if you couldn\u2019t see the corner of the wedding dress, you\u2019d never know", "Well, damn!", "Sharpie will fix that."]}
