I wasn't too thrilled about it, but my wife and I have been as supportive as possible. She still lives at home with us so our family has had to adapt to a baby in the house. My wife and I have 2 other kids, one of which lets\ncall him \"Lucas' who is 8 and has bad ADHD. He's very energetic and is always running around the house making noise. Our family is used to how he behaves and nobody has a problem with it. That was until Ava brought a baby into the house.\n\nEverything was fine until Ava started complaining that Lucas was repeatedly waking up the baby after she's finally been settled down to sleep, by making loud noises and barging into her room to look at her and try to wake her up from her sleep to play with her. She complained about it a few times and so I told Lucas that he needs to keep in mind that the baby is trying to sleep so he has to keep it down a bit, and he seemed to understand where I was coming from. I also reminded Ava that Lucas can't help how he behaves and that he is naturally loud and full of energy.\n\nI was in the kitchen one afternoon and I hear shouting coming from upstairs so I went up so see what was wrong. I walk up to see that Ava is angrily shouting at Lucas, who was in tears. I asked her what on earth was going on and she explained that again, Lucas had barged into her room shouting while the baby is sleeping and as a result had woken her up. I told her I didn't care what Lucas had done and it was no excuse for making him cry. She didn't like that I wasn't on her side and started saying how I need to start disciplining Lucas properly and that my parenting skills are awful. I fired back at her and told her that it was her decision to have a baby so young and that if she doesn't want to have to deal with Lucas then she shouldn't have had a baby whilst still living with us and if she doesn't like it she can get out of my house. She didn't say anything after this, just angrily stormed off. She's been avoiding speaking to me since this happened.", "created_utc": 1672364330, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyn9ew/aita_for_essentially_telling_my_daughter_she/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you getting him appropriate treatment ? Medication ? Or do you use it as an excuse to not parent ? 8 years old is definitely old enough to understand not to barge into someone else\u2019s room. Plus most new grandparents would be excited about the new baby but I don\u2019t see that in your post. Maybe the whole my kid isn\u2019t responsible for their behavior approach is why your 20 year old daughter already has a baby and lives in your house.", "YTA. Your son Lucas is acting out of control and I don\u2019t blame Ava for her frustration.\n\nA bit of energy and noise is one thing. Barging into a room and waking his sleeping sister is ridiculous behavior. \n\nIt really sounds like you are allowing your son to do whatever the hell he wants. I agree with her, your parenting seems lacking in this department.", "YTA, \n\nYou listed a bunch of excuses for Lucas's poor behavior but have failed to try to manage or solve any of them. One, TELL Lucas that he is absolutely not allowed to enter his sister's bedroom unless specifically invited by his sister. And if he does then he will need to face a consequence. That boundary should have been set about five years ago. Two, blaming a stressed out, sleep deprived new mother for finally losing her cool when you have failed to parent is just wrong. She asked for your assistance with her brother's behavior. \n\nAlso, Lucas is old enough to use an inside voice and to take his energy outside and run it off. \n\nLucas cried because someone finally put him in his place. I love how it is fine for Lucas to make a newborn cry and miss developmentally necessary sleep but you freak out when someone makes him cry.", "ESH\n\nAva shouldn't be yelling at Lucas to make him cry. He is young, and this won't teach him a thing. She's clearly stressed and just snapped, but it's not excuse to take it out on an 8 year old.\n\nOn the fip side, Lucas's ADHD is not entirely responsible for his behaviour. He can still learn boundaries like to not barge into rooms without permission, and *needs* to learn the empathy to not make a lot of loud noise when someone is sleeping. It may not always happen, kids make noise, kids with ADHD are loud without meaning to. I get it. But an effort can and should be made, and he is plenty old enough to start to get it, if he's taught. When I was his age at friends' houses, we would all creep around like mice if one of my friends' moms had a migraine and was trying to lay down, etc.", "YTA. Ava is your daughter. You seem mad at her for getting pregnant, but treating her like crap won\u2019t change anything, it will just hurt your relationship further. No, she shouldn\u2019t have yelled at Lucas, but he is old enough (even with ADHD) to be told he can\u2019t go in a room and wake the baby. You didn\u2019t even try to see her side. She\u2019s dealing with a whole host of post partum issues on top of you being a big ol jerk to her.", "ESH.\n\nADHD isn't the end-all that it used to be years ago.  With proper medication, therapy, etc. it can be controlled so it should not be an excuse for everything Lucas does.  \n\nAva is likely tired due to lack of sleep.\n\nYou shouldn't be favoring one child (Lucas) over the other (Ava), regardless of your feelings about Ava having a baby so young.", "YTA\n\nWhat a mean, spiteful thing to say to your daughter.\n\nLucas may be loud and energetic, but he can learn boundaries like not barging into rooms with the door closed.\n\nYou owe her a huge apology.", "YTA. Your out of control 8 year old boy is allowed to barge in and disturb an infant child??\n\nThat seems incredibly dangerous, he clearly has no understanding of how you are supposed to act around a baby. How do you know he won't accidentally hurt her or worse during one of his \"energetic\" episodes?? Especially since you are clearly refusing to set boundaries with him and his behavior regarding the baby. The baby that is your grandchild incase you have forgotten.\n\nYou clearly disapprove of your daughters choice to have a baby, but what kind of choices do you think Lucas will be making when he is a teenager, after a childhood of being absolutely feral with zero consequences? Maybe you don't understand the connection between how you raise your kids and how they turn out when they are adults.", "YTA - teach Lucas boundaries. Yes, it's your house, but dang. Your son is waking up his nephew and causing distress to your daughter who is mere WEEKS postpartum. Where is your wife in this btw? Unless your kids were adopted I assume you and she, especially, understand the physical and mental strain of being weeks postpartum, and should have some shred of empathy. She is your child too. You don't have to let her live there forever, but while she does at least be nice. Sheesh.", "ESH\n\nLucas having ADHD is an explanation for his behaviour but not an excuse. Kids with ADHD can be taught to avoid a room, for example. \n\nYou're also TA for how you spoke to her. How cruel to say that to a new Mom. You yelling at her for yelling is also a pretty good sign as to why she yells!\n\nBut your daughter also doesn't get to dictate what Lucas does in the rest of the house or be specific about when a child can / cannot make noise. She can expect he stays out of the room and away from the baby, but the rest isn't hers to dictate IMO", "Yes YTA, but also a lock on your adult child\u2019s door would solve a lot of problems here. You can actually be kind to Lucas AND Ava.", "Way to go - threatening to throw your daughter who has just had a baby (I guess as a single parent) out of the house. How lovely and supportive of you.\n\nYes, Lucas has ADHD and that's hard. He cannot control all of his behaviour but he is barging into your daughter's bedroom to wake the baby. Did you think how exhausting and upsetting that must be? How about fitting a lock for starters?\n\nYou seem to be letting your obvious resentment at your daughter's pregnancy get the better of being fair. Cut her some slack and give her some grace. She just had a baby. She doesn't need an asshole threatening to put them on the streets. YTA.", "ESH. Why the H E double hockey sticks did you not GET HER A LOCK FOR HER DOOR. And if he's loud in the hallway outside, possibly, oh, I dunno, put up a baby gate or other barrier if possible? So he can't go screaming down the hall and banging about outside the room? But you're both adults.  You should be able to figure out how to use a lock and stop the problem. You may be mad at her for having a baby but that doesn't mean you get to abuse the child by denying it sleep.", "ESH I don't think ADHD can be blamed for his behaviour, he should still be able to remember common rules in regards to barging into people's rooms, baby or no baby. But where is your daughters partner in this, is she getting any help? Is the fact that she knew you would let her continue to live there part of her decision?", "It is your job as a parent to teach your son how to behave properly. Maybe he'll have to work harder at it than some children, but it's a life skill he needs.\n\nYou were mad that your daughter made her brother cry with no regard for the fact that he made her child cry - you should be able to recall how difficult things are with a newborn.\n\nAnd then to say that your grandchild shouldn't have been born ...\n\nYTA a million times over", "YTA. Lucas is 8 years old, just because he has ADHD doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t learn boundaries. Would YOU like it if he woke you up every night when you\u2019re trying to sleep? A baby needs to nap, it\u2019s how their bodies work. \n\nI feel like you know you can\u2019t just kick Ava out at this point, so you\u2019re using Lucas as an excuse to force her out. Lucas isn\u2019t the one with the problem\u2014YOU are.", "ESH. Ava is right about you & Lucas. Your job as his parent is to teach him how to behave.  That includes staying out of places where he\u2019s not welcome, ie, Ava\u2019s room. I bet he doesn\u2019t roam the halls at school & poke his head into random classrooms. That\u2019s because his teachers taught him how to act in school. You\u2019re not doing Lucas any favors with your attitude that he doesn\u2019t have to behave because \u201che can\u2019t control himself\u201d.", "YTA. While I understand wanting to protect Lucas, and I don\u2019t agree with her yelling at him the point of tears, you as a parent could have handled this better. As someone with ADD, I wish more than anything that my parents would have gotten me professional help, and helped me learn to put my energy into proper outlets, or manage how i\u2019m feeling in a healthy and productive way. ADD is not an excuse for bad behaviour, especially when the well-being of granddaughter, not your \u201cdaughters baby\u201d, your granddaughter is at expense. There are so many solutions available to you, but it sounds like you\u2019re more focused on protecting Lucas\u2019 innocence than finding solutions that would benefit both parties.\n\nI agree with the other comments saying that your daughter doesn\u2019t have to live there, and you don\u2019t have to keep her there if you don\u2019t want to, TO AN EXTENT. If you\u2019ve agreed to accommodate for your daughter, who, as you can hopefully sympathize with, is experiencing motherhood for the very first time in her life, that also means adjusting your life for the very fresh and new human in the house. And for the love of God, give the woman, who will probably spend the next few months getting little to no sleep and PRAYING that her baby will be able to get some, a shred of sympathy. \n\nI don\u2019t know you, and I can\u2019t make any judgement on your character other than what you\u2019ve presented to us, but I will say this: If you want to support your daughter, you need to support her fully. She is going through an incredibly difficult, confusing, life changing period in her life, and she not only wants for her daughter to turn out okay, but to have the love and support she\u2019s desperately needing right now from her parents. If occasionally scolding and adjusting your other child\u2019s behaviour to ensure your daughter and grandchild can get some rest is too much for you to handle, that says enough.", "YTA \nTreat your son's ADHD. I bet his teachers hate you", "YTA \n\nLucas is old enough to know not to barge into someone else\u2019s room yelling, and waking a baby. There is zero excuse for that. You need to teach your child. And what you said? There is no excuse.", "ESH, she has had a baby while living with her parents and thus doesn\u2019t get to dictate the ground rules in the house. \n\nHowever, you are also TA for not enforcing any boundaries with Lucas. ADHD is not a license to be as loud and annoying as you want at all times in perpetuity. You are doing him a massive disservice by choosing to allow him to run absolutely rampant. That\u2019s not gonna fly when he\u2019s older and not living with you, and 8 is well past the age when he should\u2019ve started learning that he needs to respect others needs.", "YTA I agree with Ava, try disciplining the 8 year old. Just because he has high energy and ADHD, doesn't mean that he can't learn to be respectful. \n\nAlso, major AH vibes for telling your daughter that she shouldn't have had a baby! I don't know the specifics of why/how she came about having a child, but shaming your daughter this way is terrible.", "YTA. Kid has ADHD and needs you to teach him how to manage it first of all. Secondly there is no reason for him to be barging into his sister's room. Ever. He's old enough to know better. You're going to regret not helping him regulate his behaviour as he gets older", "YTA, because ADHD doesn\u2019t keep him from being reprimanded when he continues behaviors that negatively effect others like barging into Ava\u2019s room which he\u2019s been expressly told not to do.\n\nYou can be both disappointed in Ava, and not make her life more difficult to prove your point. \n\nShe is correct that you aren\u2019t doing your son any favors by excusing him constantly ignoring other boundaries.", "YTA\u2026it seems you are allowing your disapproval and her lack of resources to be pons for you to be unkind when really Lucas should have some boundaries when it comes to the baby. Threatening to put her out and telling her you don\u2019t care what Lucas has done was not productive. If you want to help maybe put a lock in the door so she knows she can lock it when she doesn\u2019t want Lucas to come in and help parent Lucas to know that while he does have a lot of energy he has to learn how to control it.", "You refer to Lucas' ADHD as if it is a get-out-of-consequences-free card. It's not.\n\nESH is my judgment. But far and above the rest, YTA.", "YTA\n\nSo, let me get this straight. You were pissed at her for making your son cry by yelling at him for bothering her child, and then proceeded to do exactly that to her? You don't see the hypocrisy here? I wonder where she learned how to deal with her emotions? And then threatened to put her on the streets? Father of the year...", "YTA that should never be said to anyone about their baby. While I was pregnant a \u201cfriend\u201d told me I was making a mistake keeping the baby, because she was struggling as a mom. 9 years ago this was said to me by a friend, while you say that to your own daughter. Your son may have ADHD but he should also know better than to barge into anyone\u2019s room, let alone one with a sleeping baby. \n\nYour daughter will remember what you said the rest of her life. Even if you apologize, she will most likely hold resentment from it because it insinuates you don\u2019t think her baby, that\u2019s here and breathing, should have been born.", "YTA.\n\nnot for what you said but how you said it. \n\nand ADHD is no excuse for not respecting other and being out of control", "YTA\n\nI have a kid with ADHD and still taught them to respect others in the house. You seem to think he can't help his behavior, but with guidance and reinforcement from you, he most certainly can. He's old enough to know better, but he hears you saying he \"can't help it\" so that's his permission to keep being a little brat about this.", "ESH", "YTA\n\nLucas absolutely CAN help how he behaves. He just has parents who are too lazy to actually parent him. You are doing him a huge disservice because his behavior isn\u2019t going to slide in the real world and people will hold him accountable.", "YTA, stop making excuses for your son's behavior you are not doing him any favors.\n\nIf his ADHD is that bad he needs a lot more structure and help and at 8 he should be able to avoid a room where a baby is sleeping. I'm not a big fan of going straight to medication but he sounds like he could benefit from it.\n\nYou obviously resent your daughter for having a baby and aren't doing much to help the the situation with your son barging into her space. This is very passive aggressive on your part. It's a way for you to punish her without actually punishing her. Nice job setting up your son to do it for you.\n\nGet your priorities straight. Get some intensive help/therapy for your 8 year old and rebuild your relationship with your daughter. \n\nBy the way the therapy for your son will be intense for you as a parent as well, YOU will have to do work as well, YOU will have to make a lot of changes in the structure of your household and the consistency of your discipline of your child.", "YTA.\n\nThe time for lecturing about not having babies when you're young, unwed, still dependent on your family has long passed - that's a lecture that should have happened to prevent pregnancy, not after it's already happened.  The time has also passed for maliciously throwing it in your own child's face.  You're past the point of no return and that baby is here so all of your hurt feelings and disappointment over her life choices no longer matter and you need to just stuff that sh\\*\\* down because there is an innocent baby who doesn't deserve to be on the receiving end of your disdain.\n\nWhat matters now is that ALL of the children have the support and environment they need and problem solving to make that happen and honestly, it sounds like you're failing every single child in this regard.  You're threatening and making vicious comments to your post-partum daughter struggling as a new mom.  You don't appear to be getting Lucas the help and support he needs to manage his ADHD - he's eight and \"he appeared to have understood\" doesn't cut it if you're not also giving him the tools and coping mechanisms to self-regulate and manage his behavior.  And you're allowing your grandchild to live in a chaos.  And since you make no mention of where the other child is in all this, I'm going to guess you think that child is doing just fine when the reality is they're probably getting lost and feeling ignored in the chaos of new babies and disruptive siblings.", "Everyone made mistakes here. Lucas needs to learn how to be quieter and about boundaries. Ava probably shouldn\u2019t live there, if she\u2019s expecting a perfectly peaceful house for her baby. You need to watch your temper and think before you speak. ESH", "\"I fired back at her and told her that it was her decision to have a baby so young\"\n\nI feel like you vented here some grudge that was born before and only now it showed.\n\nIn this situation it's not the problem that Ava decided to have a baby - but that she decides to raise it in her parent's house when there are other habitants with their individual needs.\n\nAdjusting space and facilities so it would answear different needs now was suggested in the comments and I agree - if there is problem with a boy who storms into a room, why is it still possoble for him? If he has ADHD just giving him some verbal instructions might be not enough.\n\nESH: Ava shouldnt be violent towards the boy ane expect you to accept that, you shouldn't use this situations to vent your disappointment with her motherhood and for not having this conversation earlier, before it escalated. The boy is AH-ish totally in the norm of adhd boys being AHish sometimes and crossing the boundaries - but he is a child and you should be adults.", "Yta. \n\nThe kid is loud. OK fine.

You need to start disciplining him when he does that.", "YTA\n\nMy kids (7 and 10) have ADHD. I do not let them run amok.

No, he can\u2019t help his energy levels but he most certainly can learn how to properly channel his energy AND respect boundaries. \n\nYes my kids forget and get loud but I redirect and give them a consequence if the behavior if repeated. No they are not perfect. Yes they make mistakes. If they continually woke up a newborn you bet your ass there would be a consequence.", "YTA\n\n8 is old enough for Lucas to be making reasonable efforts to not wake his baby niece. \n\nTelling a stressed new mother that she shouldn't have had a baby because she's exhausted by being woken all the time? Low. Very low. \n\nYou're playing favourites with your children. Stop it now.", "NTA for your actual question. Your 20 yo doesn\u2019t have to live there. However, you didn\u2019t ask, but you are the AH for your parenting skills. Stop making excuses-he\u2019s old enough, even with ADHD (or even lightly on the autism spectrum) to be taught to not wake the baby.

That\u2019s a horrible thing to say. You can disapprove all you want. But to say that after the baby is born is wrong. You agreed to have her and the baby there.

You can still implement boundaries but honestly it seems like he\u2019s had full run of the house since birth it\u2019s going to be hard to implement anything now and that\u2019s on you.

It sounds like instead of parenting your son you are just letting him run around and do what he wants, then blaming it on the ADHD. Speaking as someone with ADHD, you say it wasn't a problem before, but honestly it was. It was just a problem that didn't bother you.

I'm guessing a lot of people chiming in don't have much experience caring for children with special needs.\n\nFor the people who are claiming OP isn't disciplining her child, that is clearly untrue.  She talked to her son and thought he understood. Sometimes, it takes longer for some kids to get the message, but she clearly is addressing the behavior.\n\nPeople are claiming that this can be fixed with medication.  Medication isn't nearly as simple as people think.  It can take years of trial and error to find the correct dosage of the correct medication. Things often get worse before they get better.\n\nRegardless, your daughter has no right to yell at your son like that.  She has no business criticizing anybody else's parenting skills.  How can she honestly believe she can take care of a child when she can't take care of herself?", "NTA, though I think you misfired in your response to your daughter. The bit that you said that\u2019s pertinent is that she is in your house and if she doesn\u2019t like it (ie how your household operates), she can leave. Do t let her shift focus to Lucas or your parenting. Even saying that if she doesn\u2019t want to deal with Lucas she shouldn\u2019t have had a child in the house is allowing her to deflect. You\u2019re a self sufficient adult in your own household raising your own child. If she\u2019d like the same privilege she can assume the same responsibility. If she cannot, she may make reasonable requests but should not be attempting to discipline her sibling or instructing you on parenting. \n\nThat said, if Lucas is having challenges with behavior management, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to structure differently with him. He needs to be able to moderate behaviors and volume of voice. It would be a good time for him to learn to respect privacy\u2014maybe have a sign on the door to indicate  he shouldn\u2019t disturb or needs to be quiet in the area?\n\nYou\u2019re still her parent, too.

I do think this entire situation could have been handled with more compassion on both sides. She definitely shouldn't have been berating Lucas, but it's likely she's a stressed out young mother trying to handle a baby alone for the most part. It would be incredibly stressful for her to have your child waking hers up all the time. I would want to cry and scream too. \n\nHowever, people with ADHD are still able to respect rules and boundaries i.e, knowing not to just go barging into people's rooms without permission. He's eight and more than old enough to be learning boundaries. Respect starts in the home. At the moment, you may just be enabling him with the excuse of \"he has ADHD, he can't help it!\"\n\nWe're not people who don't understand how to respect others. We do. Sometimes we just need to be reminded of the rules. It's your job to enforce them and ensure your children respect those they're living with.", "Info:\nAre you helping Ava with the baby?\nI understand not being thrilled with how the baby came to be, but the reality is, the baby is a tiny human living in your house. It\u2019s your grand baby. And Ava is still your baby who has just gone through something very difficult. I\u2019m not saying coddle her but maybe have some compassion. \nAlso, what are you doing with your son to help him with his ADHD. It\u2019s distressing for people to have such little control. If the ADHD is this severe and you\u2019re not doing absolutely everything, then Y T A", "NTA. Lucas is a minor child for whom you are responsible, and he doesn\u2019t deserve to be yelled at for making a mistake. Ava is the adult responsible for your grandchild.

What exactly was Ava expecting, deciding to bring a baby into the house? She knew what Lucas\u2019s behavior was like.", "NTA, you protected your son. Could have been more subtle, but hard truths are required, sometimes.", "I mean, I'm kind of hoping that what's happening is that everyone is tired and stressed out.  \n\n\nSo, speaking as someone who was once a 20-year-old with a baby that no one thought I should have had -- it accomplishes nothing to say that a person shouldn't have had a baby that's already been born. All that does is hurt the person you're saying it to. You do know that, right? I mean, this isn't something she can go back in time and change, and a baby is not a misspelled tattoo -- most of us love our babies even if the timing of their entrance into the world wasn't ideal. At worst, saying \"you shouldn't have had a baby\" to someone who already has a baby sounds like an attempt to make a person regret their own child. At best it sounds like a mean, thoughtless retort in an argument. Either way, it does absolutely nothing to de-escalate what sounds like an already tense situation. You're the parent of both Ava and Lucas, the grandparent of that baby, and the eldest member of the family in the room with, hopefully, the most experience in childrearing. While it's certainly understandable to bristle at your adult child yelling at your younger child, you are kind of by default the person who should be de-escalating in this situation. There are two children in this story and one relatively young and newly post-partum adult, who's also your child, then there's you. You should be concerned about the welfare of all of them, not just Lucas, though I think your concern for Lucas here is very valid. And if comments that serve no purpose beyond hurting the person you're talking to are your response to stressful situations, it's hard for me to imagine you raised kids who respond well in stressful situations either -- like continually having a small baby woken up, you know?   \n\n\nAlso, as a parent of kids with ADHD, the answer is not to just let them run wild making all the noise. A child with ADHD may to some extent be noisier than one without (although they also may not be) and some noise from an 8-year-old is normal, ADHD or not, but you aren't doing Lucas any favors by not teaching him how to control himself. It doesn't matter if everyone in the family is OK with it. Have you considered that *Lucas* might not be OK with it? Feeling like you can't calm down or slow your body and brain down is *stressful*. I mean, if you're seeing a doctor and working on finding a medication that works for him or finding strategies he can use to help him control himself, fine, but just letting him run around making noise is not a treatment or solution. It's bad for *him*. It also wakes up any babies that might be in the house (or anyone else trying to nap, for that matter), and it's not a great behavior pattern for when he's out of the house either. And dealing with that is *your job*. You are his parent. One of Ava's jobs as a parent to a newborn is to make sure that the baby gets adequate sleep and also to make sure that she herself does so she can take care of him. Your failure to do *your* job interfered with her ability to do *her* job. That is actually your fault. Saying after the fact that she shouldn't have had a baby or she could just not be there ignores where you screwed up here. As I said, \"shouldn't have had a baby\" means nothing useful after the baby is born. And you knew she and the baby were there. And even if they weren't, you should still be doing something to help your child if he's having so much trouble controlling himself that he's a constant blur of noise and motion all day.   \n\n\nWhere Ava went wrong is by yelling at Lucas instead of taking it to you in the first place. She probably should have told you to actually do something for your child so that hers could get the sleep he needs... but I don't know, *would* you have? Or she should have told your wife to do something for your child. Either way, yelling at Lucas was certainly not the right answer -- it sounds like they're half-siblings from the way you put it, and she's so much older -- being yelled at by a sibling isn't the same as being yelled at by a random houseguest or even a more distant relative, and I know a lot of siblings continue patterns they started in childhood as adults, but this sounds like a case where she should have insisted one of you tackle the problem. At 5 freaking weeks post-partum, she's probably still in pain and massively sleep-deprived, which could compromise her judgment and shorten her temper, which is not an excuse, but it probably is at least a factor in an explanation for how this played out. \n\nESH, but more to you. You've had babies. You knew what this was going to be like. You could have told Ava early in her pregnancy that she needed to secure other living arrangements, but you didn't do that. You also could be doing something with Lucas other than letting him run and make noise constantly -- and should be doing that whether Ava and the baby are there or not -- but it sounds like you aren't. Ava showed poor judgement, but if you're her role model... no wonder.", "NTA\n\nAva is irresponsible for having a baby when she can't even take care of herself.", "Nta.

I wasn't too thrilled about it, but my wife and I have been as supportive as possible. She still lives at home with us so our family has had to adapt to a baby in the house. My wife and I have 2 other kids, one of which lets\ncall him \"Lucas' who is 8 and has bad ADHD. He's very energetic and is always running around the house making noise. Our family is used to how he behaves and nobody has a problem with it. That was until Ava brought a baby into the house.\n\nEverything was fine until Ava started complaining that Lucas was repeatedly waking up the baby after she's finally been settled down to sleep, by making loud noises and barging into her room to look at her and try to wake her up from her sleep to play with her. She complained about it a few times and so I told Lucas that he needs to keep in mind that the baby is trying to sleep so he has to keep it down a bit, and he seemed to understand where I was coming from. I also reminded Ava that Lucas can't help how he behaves and that he is naturally loud and full of energy.\n\nI was in the kitchen one afternoon and I hear shouting coming from upstairs so I went up so see what was wrong. I walk up to see that Ava is angrily shouting at Lucas, who was in tears. I asked her what on earth was going on and she explained that again, Lucas had barged into her room shouting while the baby is sleeping and as a result had woken her up. I told her I didn't care what Lucas had done and it was no excuse for making him cry. She didn't like that I wasn't on her side and started saying how I need to start disciplining Lucas properly and that my parenting skills are awful. I fired back at her and said that if she doesn't want to have to deal with Lucas then she shouldn't have had a child in this house and if she doesn't like it she can get out of my house. She didn't say anything after this, just angrily stormed off. She's been avoiding speaking to me since this happened.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nobody is being negatively affected by my kid being wild in our home. If we did have a baby the expectation would be that he tone it down, make an effort not to wake the baby. And he absolutely would. At this age he's been taught coping mechanisms, and is on meds. If he wanted/needed to regulate by being loud and active I would send him outside(and I do if I feel he is getting to be unsafe with how he's acting inside).\n\n When there's a baby in the house and older kid needs to learn those boundaries. The baby needs sleep, the mom needs sleep. The 8yo needs to be taught how to adjust so he can regulate and get that sensory input in a way that isn't disruptive to the baby. And OP may have to be more hands on to help that happen.", "Literally says my wife and I so I think they are the dad, or there are 2 mums. Don\u2019t know what no dad would have to do with how an ADHD child acts though. (Work with these children, family makeup makes no difference)", "I am a learning assistant. I bet if he is as extreme as the ones I work with, he doesn\u2019t. The teacher or I repeat this for them every 5 minutes to try and remind them because it just doesn\u2019t sink in. And I am with 11-12 year olds.", "I agree with YTA. I understand that having ADHD is difficult as a child, but it's still entirely possible for an 8-year-old with ADHD to learn appropriate boundaries, like not running into someone's bedroom without permission (awkward) and waking them up. If you are your wife are okay with him running into your bedroom, that is one thing. Other people deserve to have personal boundaries, even in your own home. This is not a behavior that should be happening with or without a baby in the house.", "First of all, I was comparing the behavior of the father to Ava not Lucas. They are both adults. Lucas came upstairs and upset her child, she then became angry and yelled at him. The father became angry because Ava had upset his child and yelled at her. Two upset children and two angry parents who can't handle their emotions. How is that not the same? Ava tried to shame the father for not properly raising his son. The father even went the extra mile to shame her for having a baby and threatening her living arrangements.\n\nYou are going to have to elaborate on why the situation is not the same. The only difference I see is that one is the head of the household, which doesn't give him carte blanche to behave like an AH.", "If you don't want to raise babies in a house with a special needs child, you don't tell the special needs child to stop being that way \n\nYou get your own place like an adult", "ADHD is *not* an excuse for this child\u2019s behavior. This is poor parenting and lack of boundaries."]}
