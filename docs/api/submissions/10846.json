WIBTA for telling MIL to back off?", "selftext": "\nEDIT: okay I appreciate all the comments and I\u2019m going to do what needs done. \n\n^^^Also a lot of you are deathly concerned about 100 people and I love it. Lol. I\u2019m the first of my generation having a baby currently. (No old enough cousins (5-6 year old cousins. Just me and my siblings who are old enough in this generational group) \n\nThis is my SO\u2019s first child and he is the last carrier of his birth name. So him having any babies is a huge deal I guess. (His nana says it like that)\n\nalso 100 is actually less then normal for gatherings like this. My SO  and I both chose 50 family members to invite. His family is huge and Italian and mine is huge and Puerto Rican. Weddings for our families look like 300-450 guests for a regular one if not more. ^^^\n\n\nHi, I\u2019m currently 6 months pregnant and counting. \n\n\n\nI guess I\u2019m not sure where to start. So some background I guess; Found out I was pregnant in October and have been exhaustingly nervous from day one. I\u2019m having a little girl and am very excited to meet her but again. Still nervous. \n\nI\u2019ve never been huge on dresses. I can count on one hand how many times as an adult I\u2019ve worn a dress. I typically choose a nice blouse and pair of pants for nicer events unless asked specifically to wear a dress. I also do not like patterned clothing. I\u2019m very much as tomboy as it gets. \n\nAnyway, my MIL is planning my baby shower. And I was all good with that. I didn\u2019t want one initially, but she insisted since she wasn\u2019t able to plan her daughters last year and my mom didn\u2019t want to do mine. So I let her. \n\nIt\u2019s been four long months of planning and it\u2019s happening in April. The planning is almost done. However, a couple weeks ago MIL started sending me links to dresses on Amazon and photos from in store dresses. \n\nI hadn\u2019t remembered anything being mentioned about her buying the clothing myself and SO were wearing to the shower. But according to SO, MIL was worried we\u2019d dress like \u201cbums\u201d going to the shower. \n\nI very quickly called my parents and asked if we ever looked like bums going to important events. And they said no. That when we go over for a regular visit we do which was fine. - \n\n (my thing is if I can be comfortable and there\u2019s no reason to dress up I won\u2019t. But this event is 100 people and I definitely wasn\u2019t planning on going in jammies) \n\n\nAnyway. I tried explaining to my MIL that I don\u2019t like the way I look in dresses. And that most of my family has never seen me in a dress before and I\u2019m insecure about it. But she seems not to have listened. And is still sending me photos/links to dresses that I\u2019ve blatantly said I do not like. \n\n(I\u2019m also plus size and most plus size dresses have floral patterns and make me feel like I look like a couch.) \n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to wear a dress? \n\nAnd\n\nWould I be the asshole if I told her I will find and pay for my own outfit?", "created_utc": 1677292341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11b9mea/aita_for_not_wanting_to_wear_a_dress_to_my_baby/", "score": 231, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "NTA, it's perfectly fine for you to buy  your own clothes to wear for your baby shower. You're a grown woman. I suggest palazzo pants. They're pants but look almost like a dress. They're stretchy and comfy, too. \nMy granddaughter and my best friend are not girly girls either. I'm a girly girl, lol. They always like what I buy them though, because I know them both so well. So I know what they like and don't like. I would never buy my granddaughter anything frilly or especially pink. It would be a waste of money and inconsiderate, as well. If I bought my best friend a dress with flowers, she would throw it at me, lol. \nYour MIL is nice to throw you a baby shower. So I'd just tell her, thank you, but you already have something to wear. Then change the subject. Like talk about the cake, invitations, Amazon and Target gift registries or something else related to the baby shower. If she still can't comprehend that you're capable of dressing yourself. Your husband should talk to her. If I was that insensitive to my DIL, my son would call me to let me know. I love her so I don't ever want to purposely hurt her feelings. I didn't know she wasn't a hugger. Her sister saw me hugging her one day and started laughing out loud.
