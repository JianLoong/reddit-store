Instead, she just threw it out, a horrible waste of food and completely disrespectful to you.

Your brother's gf is very young. I'm not surprised by her immaturity, and her snap decision to throw out perfectly good food. Clearly, she has some growing up to do. I can also surmise that part of her stupid decision has a lot to do with being pregnant also. I believe the term is pregnancy brain. It's basically your brain being overly taxed because there is simply a lot more that the brain is being asked to do because of the pregnancy. I consider myself a pretty intelligent lady, but even I made some pretty goofy choices that I never would have made if it weren't for being pregnant. I've never been that dotty before or since.

It boggles my mind how people think that barely obscuring the word they were going to use would make people feel differently about their comment? as if when we see A**hole or A$$hole we don't just read it as asshole in our heads anyways? I could go on a tirade about this for three hours.", "There are so many ways through which you can deal in such situation", "Cost of traveling to a different state < Raising a child\n\nOf course it shouldn't come down to that, but that's the current reality", "Yup. Trashing the steak was a power move. The boyfriend, his parents and that kid are going to be in for a world of hurt if they keep condoning this type of behavior.", "Exactly no one would want such \n\nWomen in their house", "Yuppppp!!", "She could have left the house instead of throwing the food in garbage", "i agree! but i'm aware we're very lucky here to have free and easily accessible abortions with lots of support and no pushback, so i'm not inclined to immediately judge people who feel they have to make a difference choice (or don't have a choice) for whatever reason - while it may be an inherently mature choice to get an abortion because you're aware of your limited capabilities or simply don't want a child, i don't think it's inherently immature to go the other way, lots of factors go into it and we likely aren't seeing all of them from an outside perspective", "Depending on the state where you live, you can get arrested for going to another state to get an abortion.", "Yeah exactly this. Putting something in a garbage can inside the house doesn't take away the smell (ok maybe slightly w a lid but still, her behavior makes no sense).", "When I was pregnant I found that the grocery store I usually shopped in started smelling like meat that was starting to go bad.  It was nauseating.   Apparently pregnancy makes you more sensitive to smells, especially anything that might harm the baby.  I never trusted the meat department in that store after that.", "Ya i had horrible morning sickness until day kid was born and there was no way I could handle perfume. It's just so sketchy, doesn't seem to be the smell that was her problem.", "Pill+Condom+Spermicide+Bidet toilet+Plan B for 5 days after = No pregnancy.", "As a teenager, sometimes I would cook the meat for my mom because it still would bother her sometimes.", "It depends on the procedure. There's three\n\n1. putting a clamp on the tubes (it can fall off or loosen)\n2. cutting the tubes (they can heal and reconnect)\n3. having the tubes completely removed (typically the only 100% guarantee)", "Not just a guest, the brother invited himself and her over, OP didn't do the inviting.", "This brought back a memory of my mom spraying at least ten shots of Bath and Body Works concentrated room spray directly into my open mouth and face as I backed away, asking/yelling at her to stop. I'd dropped by for a visit.  My uvula and throat swelled up.  I couldn't breathe.  I started yelling and ran outside saying \"I can't breathe \".  Then my father came downstairs and accused me of causing a scene in their neighborhood and telling me the neighbors could here my yells. She plays like she's dumb and innocent.  But too many of these instances have happened.  Anyhoo, pregnancy is not a reason to be an AH about food.", "You're not killing anything because it's not fucking alive, fuck off with this shit", "If that really happens a lot, it sounds as though she's trying to kill you.", "what is that?", "No it isn't. \n\nNothing is more important than life. Nobody has the right to forcefully terminate anyone else's life", "You think something that is growing, has a heart beat, and a unique set of DNA is not alive?", "Reddit is making changes to how they charge for the use of their API by third party apps. Basically a ton of subreddits are protesting and the quality of content may drop starting tomorrow.", "Do I take that to mean you don't eat meat and don't believe in the death penalty? If a clump of cells is so important to you, actual life must be. Unless you're a raging hypocrite.", "No one has the right to use someone else's body against their will.", "Look, you don\u2019t like abortion, don\u2019t get one. But it\u2019s her life that will be affected not yours. You don\u2019t get a say. Better to send the child to heaven than a shitty life on earth."]}
