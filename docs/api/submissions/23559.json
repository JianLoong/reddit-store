My wife came with a 6-year-old daughter Jay now 15. My wife and I also have twin boys together I make the majority of the money while my wife works part-time at the boy's school. \n\nJay has never liked me, I think it is because my relationship with her mom confirmed her mom and dad aren\u2019t going to get back together. Meanwhile, I\u2019m always there for Jay, at her soccer games, help her with homework, and drive her places considering I\u2019m the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d who pays for most of Jay\u2019s things which is completely fine I love Jay. \n\nHer bio Dad is an absolute POS full of broken promises always letting Jay down. He\u2019s selfish and prioritizes himself over his kid. Jay still adores him though and wants him In her life. Because of that if Jay usually tells me I\u2019m not her dad and takes it out on me verbally if her dad\u2019s being his usual POS self which hurts honestly. \n\n2 weeks ago was Jay\u2019s bday and her dad promised he would come to her party but didn\u2019t show up later after the party Jay got a text from him saying sorry he got caught up with things but will make it up to her. Jay and I were the only ones up so when she started sobbing I heard. I instantly started trying to comfort her. After a few minutes, Jay freaked out telling me to leave me alone. As I was leaving to give her her space she said \u201cgod you\u2019re not even my real dad anyway stop trying to act like it (first name)\u201d. I understand I\u2019m not her bio dad but constantly getting verbally abused just because I\u2019m not her bio dad even though I\u2019ve always been there for her is exhausting. \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk unless needed until yesterday. Jay asked for money so she could go get lunch and go shopping with a few friends. After how she treated me I decided to say why don\u2019t you ask your real dad for money because you constantly remind me I\u2019m not him. She started crying and ran to her room. My wife said I was harsh because I know how shitty her bio dad is but she understands because of how Jay treats me. I also told a few friends and they all called me AH. So am I\u2026 I feel like it needed to be said for Jay to finally realize how much I do for her even if I\u2019m not her \u201creal dad\u201d.", "created_utc": 1690813245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ehji1/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_to_ask_her_real/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My dad (step dad, but he is my dad) put up with me telling him for years that he wasn't my \"real dad\". I was pretty brutal. The difference between me and your step daughter is that I never asked him for anything. It took me a long time and a lot of therapy to understand that I was upset that a guy who had no reason to care gave more love and support than the sperm donor that was supposed to love me unconditionally. I was around 20 when it finally sunk in. My relationship with him got a lot better after I figured out my own headspace. Sadly, he passed away the year I turned 38.

You are NTA for how you feel but you have to do the critical thinking about how when Jay is rejected by Biodad, Jay takes it out on you.  (I mean kid is 15, and doesn't have a fully developed brain, so you have to adult it.) You care and are hurt by the constant rejection when you didn't do anything, just like Jay did nothing to constantly be ditched by Biodad.  Ask them how they feel when Biodad \"forgets\" to show up and then let them know their actions make you feel the same way.

Give her the space to be angry while protecting yourself.

My wife came with a 6-year-old daughter Jay now 15. My wife and I also have twin boys together I make the majority of the money while my wife works part-time at the boy's school. \n\nJay has never liked me, I think it is because my relationship with her mom confirmed her mom and dad aren\u2019t going to get back together. Meanwhile, I\u2019m always there for Jay, at her soccer games, help her with homework, and drive her places considering I\u2019m the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d who pays for most of Jay\u2019s things which is completely fine I love Jay. \n\nHer bio Dad is an absolute POS full of broken promises always letting Jay down. He\u2019s selfish and prioritizes himself over his kid. Jay still adores him though and wants him In her life. Because of that if Jay usually tells me I\u2019m not her dad and takes it out on me verbally if her dad\u2019s being his usual POS self which hurts honestly. \n\n2 weeks ago was Jay\u2019s bday and her dad promised he would come to her party but didn\u2019t show up later after the party Jay got a text from him saying sorry he got caught up with things but will make it up to her. Jay and I were the only ones up so when she started sobbing I heard. I instantly started trying to comfort her. After a few minutes, Jay freaked out telling me to leave me alone. As I was leaving to give her her space she said \u201cgod you\u2019re not even my real dad anyway stop trying to act like it (first name)\u201d. I understand I\u2019m not her bio dad but constantly getting verbally abused just because I\u2019m not her bio dad even though I\u2019ve always been there for her is exhausting. \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk unless needed until yesterday. Jay asked for money so she could go get lunch and go shopping with a few friends. After how she treated me I decided to say why don\u2019t you ask your real dad for money because you constantly remind me I\u2019m not him. She started crying and ran to her room. My wife said I was harsh because I know how shitty her bio dad is but she understands because of how Jay treats me. I also told a few friends and they all called me AH. So am I\u2026 I feel like it needed to be said for Jay to finally realize how much I do for her even if I\u2019m not her \u201creal dad\u201d.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When you took her on as a step child, you took her on as a parent.

She is 15 and also a good lesson for her anyway not to treat people like doormats and then expect favours", "NTA \u2014 But you all might need family therapy. Everyone is playing a part in this dynamic, and it\u2019s not going to be solved with just Jay in therapy.", "YTA. She\u2019s a kid who is dealing with a a lot. It probably took a lot of courage for her to ask you for money since you said she already doesn\u2019t like you.\n\nI\u2019ve been in her shoes and if my step dad did this to me I\u2019d never speak to him ever again. Is that what you want?", "NTA- I'm a step parent myself and sometimes you have to say the things that get your step kids to wake up and see that they're not treating you right", "Shes a teenager dealing not only with the complicated emotions of a teenager, but the complicated emotions of a bio dad who clearly doesn\u2019t love and supporter. She seems to be aware of that fact and it sucks. \n\nYou\u2019re the adult here. You had an opportunity to be the adult and you chose instead to make a petty remark. You didn\u2019t even need to give her money considering your relationship lately. \nInstead you chose to hurt her.\n\nOften times teenagers can be tough. Years later they will look back in retrospective of their shitty behavior and many feel bad. They will also look at how the adults treated them as well. \n\nYTA for the comment you made.", "You'll probably get eviscerated here, since I'm pretty sure this place is full of 14 year olds who hate their stepparents. But I get it. You aren't some perfect being; you're going to have emotional reactions when she lashes out at you in spite of everything you do for her. And really, she is old enough to start learning that you don't lash out at people who are just trying to help you. She's being a typical kid her age, though, and you have to be the adult here. Probably an unpopular opinion but NAH. A very human reaction on both sides and I think if you apologize and give her some space then it'll probably be fine.", "NTA.  Everyone has a breaking point.  She is 15 and old enough to understand that hurting someone on purpose has consequences.  Just remember not to hold a grudge so you can talk about this later.", "NTA . At what point does OP stop eating crap. He has been there for her and I know she is a teen, but that excuse gets old real fast. The Mother is also the AH, while it might not help, she needs to reinforce that OP isn't the enemy, its her Bio dad. OP made his point and from the sound of it, will back off. I just hope the daughter grows up quickly or she is in for a lot of heartbreak.", "This is honestly a tough one. Many comments are stating that Y T A because you're an adult and she's a child so you shouldn't have said what you did. While there's a part of me that understands that Jay is a hurting teenager, what she did and continues to do unchecked is leaving a bad taste in my mouth. At no point in time would I have been allowed to disrespect an adult in my household like she continues to disrespect you, OP. \n\nAt some point, Jay does need to realize that you can't be the bully and the victim. I get that she's pissed about her parents divorce and her father's inability to be reliable. But it's not okay or reasonable for her to take it out on you when you're trying to be there for her. However, she sees no issue with asking and expecting you to fulfill her wants and needs at her whim regardless of how she's treating you. I'm sorry, I can't cosign this behavior in a 15 year old. This type of dynamic is what leads to entitlement and taking advantage of other people. Sort of, 'No matter how I act, I expect you to give or do what I want because you need to show me how much you care. I'll continue to treat you like crap, but I expect you to keep going above and beyond.'  No. That's not the way life works. \n\nI have to ask where your wife/her mom is in all this? Has she tried to give Jay the information she needs concerning the divorce and the fact that she doesn't have to like you, but she does need to respect you? If she has and it still hasn't helped, then Jay needs some family therapy to work through her issues with her dad. It's not fair to you and especially to her brothers for them to see their dad being crapped on all the time by their older sister.\n\nFor me, despite her age and her pain, Jay is old enough to know quite a bit about what is right and what is wrong. Her feelings concerning you may be a bit jumbled in the minutiae of her feelings about her father, but you're NTA here.", "Very gently YTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear this! You seem like you\u2019re trying really hard and it\u2019s really hurtful to hear this over every single thing. \n\nThe hard part about being a parent is that even when your kids have pushed you to the absolute limit you do still need to watch yourself and not react to things like this. I\u2019m sorry, I understand that you\u2019re hurting but it\u2019s true.\n\nYour daughter needs therapy and you both need to sit down and have a larger conversation about this. She\u2019s also a teenager and we\u2019re horrible at that point in our lives. It\u2019s also really messed up but we do treat our family and the people we love a bit worse because we also know they\u2019ll be around. This is not to excuse her behaviour, but to in some weird way reassure you. She knows you\u2019ll be around; your behaviour over the years has shown her that.\n\nHer mom does need to step in a bit over here and make this conversation happen though. It\u2019s not okay that you guys didn\u2019t speak for two weeks and that this was the first interaction. Therapy is needed here.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but I\u2019ll tell you why I think you\u2019re wrong. She\u2019s 15 and a lot of 15 yo\u2019s just suck. So she\u2019d be hurtful to you regardless of you being a step parent or a bio parent. If you were her bio parent with no divorce or other BS, she\u2019d lash out at you for something different.

You shouldnt have done that much earlier. You let her abuse your kindness over the years. If she hates you that much she can live with her dad. No ones stopping her. Thats how you deal with it.

Also when she turns 18 kick her out.", "YTA\n\nThis is a child whose father does not care for her. She used to have one reliable male figure in her life. You.

She has zero control over her life, you don't.\n\nDoes that mean she should be allowed to treat you badly? Of course not. But being the supposed grown up in the relationship, you should discuss with her, in a calm situation, how what she says hurts you. Not just react, like a teenager yourself. You owe her an apology. And you owe all of you some good family therapy.", "NTA. She has to grow up and see that you are doing all the things her biodad should be and apologize for lashing out at you.

She needs to know actions and words have consequences and, while you\u2019re an adult, you\u2019re also human and to be treated that way constantly is completely unfair. You\u2019re not her \u201cdad\u201d until she needs something from you. I would say your wife needs to sit her down and have a chat with her about all of this as it\u2019s unfair to everyone!", " YTA\n\nDon\u2019t become a step parent if you can\u2019t handle not being *the parent* while still being financially responsible and a side parent.  \n\nKids don\u2019t owe you anything for receiving what their entitled to. The kid-parent relationship (even step parent) is very one directional for bulk of first two decades.  Kids had no say in birth, in parents (or marriages), nothing.  Forced power imbalance.  Parents owe kids, not the other way around until relationship can start to be a two way.  That isn\u2019t truly possible until they\u2019re transitioning into adulthood and treated with independence, etc.  15 has a long way to go.\n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t matter if you make more than your wife, your assets are shared.  Decide with your wife an appropriate allowance from your combined income.

All she can think of in these moments is that her dad doesn't live her, and man, that must hurt a lot. No wonder that she lashes at you.\n\nSo, sir, YTA.\nInstead of acting like you did, a little sympathy could work better : tell her you're sorry, but the stuff with her dad isn't your fault, as it isn't her fault either.\nAlso, even if you're not her dad, you're here for her if she wants to, and either if her real dad is there or not.", "Please please please read- \n\nLove should never be conditional.

She is 15 and trying to navigate what her life looks like and what to make of it. Please give her grace. \n\nIn a weird way, and please believe me on this, her lashing out at you actually means that she feels safe enough around you to express how she\u2019s feeling. Don\u2019t take her words literally. Try to read what\u2019s happening at a higher level. She felt let down by her dad, her own blood, but someone like you was even kinder towards her.

Do let mom step up and provide for her child not to be vindictive but to show mom that you deserve respect and support. Also to show the teen what life really would be like without step dad\u2019s financial and emotional support.  This is a lesson and consequence for bad behavior not a punishment.

For all his faults, not letting me treat him like shit, just because I've had it a bit hard, is one of the best things he did for me.", "She still can\u2019t except op to give her money after the way she keeps treating him atleast treat him with real respect because of all the things he has done for her", "Kick the dog syndrome or not, treating people like crap then expecting them to just give whatever is asked for is AH behaviour.", "According to OP, his wife is the one who told his stepdaughter to ask him for money.", "Still doesn\u2019t change the fact that jay expected op to just give her money after all the things she said to him", "Her mom was the one who expected OP to give her the money. All the step daughter wanted was money and she went to her mother first.", "She should have waited for her mum to finish with her siblings instead of going to op expecting him to give her money because she went to op knowing full well all the things she said she thought there wouldn\u2019t be any consequences for her behavior"]}
