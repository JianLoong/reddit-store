I earned and paid for almost everything. I supported us and paid for Tom to go to college. 8 years ago he had a proper plan to start a business, and I supported him. While it was mostly his skill and hard work that made it successful, I funded everything. \n\nThings changed when we had Nida four years ago. My husband's business was getting successful the year before, my job didn't like me taking maternity leave, and part time wasn't an option, so my husband convinced me to be a stay at home mother. While it was hard, I did ended up enjoying it.\n\nMy husband was extremely hard working and lucky and has managed to stay successful despite everything over the last few years. I do admittedly spend a lot on myself and my daughters, and more frequent since I'm home. Plus we did take things easier and hire some help for cleaning and everything for the second pregnancy because it was a lot worse than my first. However my husband had NO issue with it, though he prefers simple experiences himself. We can afford it, there's no financial issues. However, apparently my brother-in-law, Zeke, disagrees\n\nWhen I was around 5 months I had a weekend out with my friends. It was the first time in months, and I obviously didn't drink or do anything crazy. But we did have a great time and admittedly spend a lot. When I got home Zeke apparently didn't hear me, and I overheard him 'warning' my husband 'again' not to have our daughter with me. Apparently I'm a 'gold digger' 'using him' for money. That a good wife wouldn't be going out and spending all his money like 'that greedy bitch does', I should be a good wide and do all the cleaning, cooking and childcare without help. That I already 'baby-trapped' him once and he has to go now. So his advice is for Tom to leave his pregnant wife and take Nida with him. Tom did tell him he's being crazy and to stop, but I got mad and yelling at him. I told him he's single for a reason and it ain't money, and if I was a gold digger I wouldn't have touched my husband and to basically get out.\n\nSince then I want nothing to do with him, and thought Tom didn't. But it's almost Tom's birthday and he wants to invite Zeke over like nothing happened. I refused, and don't want him anywhere near our home, daughters or me. Tom is pissed and says it's his birthday and his brother so I don't get to say no. But with what Zeke said, he shouldn't be ok with him. Apparently I'm 'proving he has a point' by arguing about this. And that Zeke was just 'concerned' about him. I told him if he invites him, our daughters and I won't be there, and it hasn't gone well.\n\nTom thinks I'm being a selfish asshole and his parents are jumping on the Sarika's a shitty gold digger train. I think it's bullshit. Sure I live on his money now, but it was built on mine. I don't care if it's his brother. He's wrong to think it, and Tom should be on my side.

I'm not sure the reasoning how you could be a gold digger or baby-trapping someone. Can anyone on here understand this and explain it to me because I'm not seeing the logic. NTA", "NTA. Zeke is saying slanderous things about you, your husband should be shutting it down. You helped him build his empire, you were there when he had nothing. That is not gold digger behavior.", "NTA. The man called you a bitch. in your home. also did i read that right, that his advice to your husband was to take only *one* of your daughters and run??? so his advice was not financial therapy, but to split the family up? that is shite advice regardless of the situation", "NTA\n\nYou had been married for 6 years, when you had Nida. That's some seriously amateur baby-trapping right there. Zeke doesn't seem to know what it even means.\n\nYour husband needs to shut his brother down, tell him to apologise, inform him that he'd have no money/business if not for you. \n\nGet counselling. Stat. Your husband needs to understand what he's allowing Zeke to do. \n\nIf hubby isn't willing to do either of those things, you may need to consider taking Zeke's advice and start planning your exit, because nobody should have to accept being insulted and undermined in their own home.", "NTA. Zeke has some seriously misogynistic ideas. You supported your husband while he was in school, and the decision to be a SAHM was made together. \n\nI gotta be honest: it\u2019s concerning that your husband wants to have Zeke over without him offering you an apology for what he said. And the whole \u201cproving he has a point\u201d line is really worrying. It means he is listening to his brother and is starting to agree with him. This is not good for the father of daughters. \n\nYou are right: your current life was built on your work.", "Ask your husband \"Would you expose your poor little brother to an evil golddigger like me\" \n\nHe has not apologized, right? Also, has your husband ever set the record straight - about you funding his success? \n\nNTA\n\nThis is a serious red flag - and if you haven\\`t used a fake name for your husband - he\\`s NOT worthy of that name!", "NTA. Kind of sounds like your husband agrees with him though. That's the only reason I can see with him pushing this issue.", "NTA.   \n\n\nZeke sounds like an incel; he's probably been listening to Andrew Tate. The rest of the family sounds envious and toxic, and trying to tear you down. Zeke may be your husband's brother, but you are his wife first and foremost.  \n\n\nAs for your husband, I would be concerned about his attitude to this whole situation. I wouldn't rush to divorce, but maybe have a conversation about possibly doing some couples counselling. If I am to give his words and actions the most generous interpretation, he doesn't want to rock the boat with the rest of his family and risk being estranged from them.   \n\n\nLikely, his family is the type who rugsweeps a lot, and that it's better for the wronged party to just suck it up and keep quiet to keep the peace for the sake of 'family'.", "NTA.\n\nZeke is projecting. He has his own issues and it's possible he doesn't want his money making brother spending money on his own family instead of giving it to Zeke (or some other reason that makes it problematic for Zeke for his brother to have a wife he takes good care of). Does Zeke need a wealthy wing man when he goes out trolling for women? Is he a gold digging brother who wants to ask his brother for money? My only concern is that it seems like he might be getting into your husband's head if your husband is defending him.\n\nSaying someone is \"overreacting\" (or worse, \"you're too sensitive\" from bullies when you're being mistreated) is such gaslighting BS. Now that you helped him get where he is, his family wants to stick their hand in the cookie jar and edge you out of what they think should be their share.\n\nPS if S------ is really your name, edit it out.", "How in the world does your BIL know what you spend?  Sounds like your husband isn\u2019t as good with everything as you think. NTA", "NTA - Zeke is an asshole especially since you talked this through with your husband.\nAs for Tom, he\u2019s a little bit of an AH. Yes he should back you up and support you but I can see why cutting out your own brother may be hard for him.  Has zeke even tried to apologise at all? If not then you\u2019re justified otherwise maybe it\u2019s a bit harsh to take the kids away from his birthday if the brother shows up", "I\u2019d find a babysitter or something and go back to work and I would let them know how much you made plus you were paying for everything in the beginning. If he feels like you are a gold digger would you want to stay with a man that thinks you are. I would remind him his success was built off yours & idk I would stay with family plus your pregnant that\u2019s wrong", "I would secure a job and have a conversation with your husband to see if he believes that as well. Also remind him, Zeke and whoever else that you were the bread winner for a long time and the one who financially supported his now successful business. It's sad you even have to take it there but don't let his family/friends disrespect you like that. Your husband should also stand up for you properly", "NTA. Zeke's characterizations make no sense whatever. If we're pointing fingers here, wasn't Tom the golddigger (or fortune hunter, lol!) originally, marrying you to fund his education & business?  Certainly he ought to on your side unequivocally. Ideally if he pursues a relationship with Zeke it would be far, far away from you or your daughters. \n\nBut as others have suggested, please don't just walk away over Tom's insistence at including Zeke. If your marriage founders over this issue then you're giving Zeke exactly what he wants. The narrative henceforth will always be: *Zeke was crude, but he was right after all!*\n\nSit down with Tom. Demanding he go NC with his brother is extreme. Surely there are compromises here. Tom doesn't seem to be demanding that you continue a relationship with Zeke as though nothing happened. But obviously he should not invited into your home until he has at least apologized & you have accepted. Best of luck here.", "Why can't Tom invite Zeke to go out somewhere for his birthday? That way they can still hang out together and you and the children can be at home in peace.\n\nNTA", "Zeke - AH - greedy and wishing he was mining that gold. \n\nHusband - AH.  Why is he letting his friends and family disrespect you? \nSeriously......you were the one who believed in him and his dream.  Not them.  You supported him.  Not them.  \n\nHusband parents - AH - you all worked hard to build this life for your family.  It took team work and dedication from all parts.  They should recognize what a good wife is.  Zeke was likely parroting them.  \n\nOP - NTA but your drifting into murky waters. \n\nIt's your husband birthday.  I wouldn't punish your husband.  \n\nInstead, I would ask that boundaries be set about how you are treated.  Zeke and your in-laws had no problem with the money arrangements when it was you working.  Whether you made easily or by working hard.  It all spends the same. \n\nYour husband wanted you as a stay at home mom.  You agreed. Now his family and friends can treat you with some respect or he is guilty of disrespecting you.  \n\nIf the topic is brought up about getting a divorce.  Make sure to remind him you were his sole investor and have the bank roll to prove it.  Regardless of his hard work.  You don't abandoned the ones who believed in you and you don't let people disrespect them either.", "You see, when it comes to money, people\u2019s memories can be very short. I say you try to get an official legal piece of the business or go back to work and make your own money again. Your husband is easily influenced, his head is getting big. All he sees is he\u2019s a self made man and you\u2019re the lazy SAHM who relies on him. I got burned by a friend like him, who I helped so much and turned back to throw self made in my face.", "NTA\n\nYou are no way a gold digger as it was you're money.\n\nTo prove a point and I'm petty like this I would do one of two things,\n\nwrite a list of most of the things you paid for before he job his job and ask to be paid back in instalments. Express it was a loan OR, (I think this is better) Ask for a stake in your husband business as without you it wouldn't be here today. Ask for at least a 20% (or at at least a decent chunk) stake to repay for all the money you put towards it, honestly if it were me this would have been in the initial planning of the business anyway, but now even more so.\n\nI know most people are going to disagree because your married etc, but honestly not all marriages last and as you put in well over half the money for his job/business you are entitled for you share back starting now.  And this still isnt being a gold digger, you asking for you money back you gave to help him. \n\nAlso Tom is an ass and what he said was awful, remember he's single for a reason.", "NTA and its so wrong that he's even entertaining having him in your house after what he said. I would expect him to completely cut him off until he gets on his hands and knees in front of you and begs you to forgive him for being such a giant AH. He definitely shouldn't want anybody who is willing to say those things about you anywhere near your daughters. You husband needs to be reminded who it is that got him to where he is now.", "NTA. Why\u2019s it always gotta be the woman that\u2019s a \u201cgold digger?\u201d Doesn\u2019t look like anyone was hollering gold digger when OP was paying for her husband to go to college. No, she was probably just \u2018supporting her man like she\u2019s supposed to\u2019 then. Shady.\n\nOP, hopefully you, Tom, and your family aren\u2019t torn apart by his brother\u2019s misogynistic mess. But you and Tom need to get on the same page. Teamwork makes the dream work but cause of this, he doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s being a good team mate.", "NTA. That AH should be nowhere near you and your children. If your husband wants to hang out with him he can go to his brothers house. Huge red flags from your husband tho with the comment that his brother may have a point.", "NTA- but the issue here isn't that you are/aren't baby trapping your husband. Its clear that you aren't. The issue here is that Zeke disrespected you, was rude to you, questioned your motives of your marriage. You set a boundary of \"hey, you aren't going to talk shit like that around me or my children\" and you are again, being disrespected now by your husband, who is entertaining Zeke's ideas by saying you are proving a point because you don't want to be disrespected.", "Now that the family is involved you're in a very difficult position. Z openly insulted you, encouraged him to leave you and take 1 of your children with him, dividing and destroying a  family. Your husband offered a token, tepid push back at best.\n\nYour husband has not managed his family. He has not insisted Z apologize. He wants to pretend it's water under the bridge. At your expense.\n\nHe's allowing you to be villified, and doing nothing about it. That's telling. I suspect he has more of an issue with your lifestyle and spending than you realize. Because it sounds like he secretly agrees with this reasoning. \n\nI would have a sit down with your husband and really confide feelings about spending and lifestyle, as well as your hurt and his lack of support and protection from his family.\n\nIf he's not going to back and protect you, he can't expect you to spend time with his family. But you need to find out if he has issues with your current lifestyle choices, or is it just his family.", "NTA. Has Zelda always been a jerk with you, openly, or did he secretly hold this? Can I also ask this, was it clear what you did financially for your husband? I won\u2019t get into to many details, as your post, simply an example. I am older and was sick about a decade ago. I have no living family and had bought a very reasonable house for my sister( after the housing market crashed) My sister died. As I said I was was sick and had no one to leave my things to( I am NOT wealthy, but didn\u2019t want my things going to the state) I put a house into a friend\u2019s name. She did pay for a few upgrades( hot water heater, etc) as she wants to give it to her daughter eventually. I find out she didn\u2019t tell people I gave her the house. I do NOT care about that, BUT I did care she told people she paid for about 2k worth of upgrades and told people. Did your husband tell people YOU paved the way for his success? If not, he is wrong, also. Zeke seems like he either has wrong information or is just being an absolute jerk. I would strongly suggest you make sure the truth of your husband\u2019s success was generated by your help!", "NTA.  I can see why this is upsetting.  It sounds like you and your husband have navigated your marriage successfully and have been on the same page, so his reaction to his brother doesn\u2019t make sense to me.  I\u2019m sure he loves his brother and values his opinion, but he should have shut it down when Zeke crossed the line and disrespected you.  You are his wife and your family should be his priority.  Your husband didn\u2019t take a firm stand against his brother and I can see why you felt compelled to defend yourself.  It\u2019s just a shame that it even got to that point.  Maybe you aren\u2019t on the same page after all?  \n\nIMHO, that\u2019s the real issue and that\u2019s the conversation that you need to have with your husband.  If he has a problem with the arrangement, then he needs to communicate with you.  I don\u2019t mean telling you that you are \u201cproving that Zeke has a point\u201d.  Fuck Zeke.  Deal with whatever issue is causing your husband to waffle on his end of the united front.  Then, as a couple, decide how to deal with Zeke.  He inserted himself into your marriage, unsolicited\u2026and you heard every disrespectful comment.  If Zeke wants to be a part of your lives, then he needs to acknowledge that he was wrong.  It makes sense for him to make things right with you first, or else it\u2019s going to affect your marriage and their relationship as brothers.  Why shouldn\u2019t he have to apologize?  Why wouldn\u2019t your husband want that?    It\u2019s the best way to show Zeke (and you) that your husband has your back.", "NTA. Omggg if one of my \u201cfriends\u201d said that about my partner I would cut them from my life immediately. How incredibly disrespectful.", "Nta. It blows my mind how men won\u2019t be shit and need help for months/years and then when they make it you\u2019re a gold digger lol", "NTA. And not a gold digger. I guess you just didn\u2019t get the message that to some people, women can\u2019t do anything right.", "NTA, your husband's brother told him to leave his pregnant wife and take her child from her bc he was concerned about money that wasn't his. In what world would someone want to interact with such a person? Ask your husband if he got sick in the hospital on a vent and your family member suggested you leave him and take the kids bc of how much the hospital bills are gonna cost and ask him if he'd like to play nice with them.", "NTA\n\nBut marriage counselling STAT with your husband. You say your husband has never complained but it sounds like there are some things he is sharing with his family instead of with you. This is not healthy.   \n\n\nHe needs to share his concerns directly with you like an adult and you both need to listen to each other like adults.   \n\n\nThis doesn't sound like a broken marriage yet but you need to communicate a lot better now.", "NTA. And this guy, with his backward, misogynistic attitudes, shouldn't be around your kids.", "ESH.\n\nJust hear me out.\nNo doubt Zeke is wrong with his accusations, and at the moment, I wouldn't blame you for screaming at him.\n\nBut now, you need to sit and have a honest word with your husband. Zeke is his brother. He is entitled to have a relationship with him. By just stomping your feet, you are acting like a tantrum toddler. Talk with husband, tell him how much you're hurting, explain that you never regretted supporting him in the beginning, and you're happy his professional dreams came true. Ask him if he regrets anything. Use this moment to strengthen your bond. But tell him zeke never apologized for the name calling, and his parents are making it worse. Ask if the would be happy to be called gold digger in the beginning, when you were the breadwinner and paying for his studies and funding everything. Ask if it's fair they to this to you now. \n\nMost importantly, listen to his answers. That it's going to make you realize the truth about what's in his mind. And if the agrees with you, he will be your champion to demand an apology from them. But it needs to be his decision or you'll just push him further away.", "ESH but hold on.\n\nYTA for one reason. Stop using your children as a weapon in your arguments you selfish asshole. They are innocent and not props for your fights. Leave them out of it.\nI get it, he is an asshole for not understanding your pain.\nZeke is clearly an asshole as you\u2019re not a gold digger assuming what you are saying is all true.\n\nBut regardless you are an asshole for using your children as a ploy.\nIf you aren\u2019t happy with zeke going to the birthday party then you say you won\u2019t go. That\u2019s fair. But why are you threatening to take his children away\u2026 that\u2019s a horrible things to do to him and your children. That\u2019s a really nasty thing to do which makes me worry about your truth.", "ESH. I was fully behind you until I got here:\n\n>Tom is pissed and says it's his birthday and his brother so I don't get to say no. But with what Zeke said, he shouldn't be ok with him.\n\nZeke is an asshole, no doubt about it. What he said was way out of line and probably comes from a place of jealousy. You have every right to be pissed and want nothing to do with him. But to dictate what your husband should feel about it is not your place. He shut it down as soon as it came up and was probably going to let it go unless Zeke brought it up again. But on the other hand, him telling you that you don't get to say no is just as shitty and invalidating as you telling him how he should feel. This really is a situation in which everyone is being an asshole to everyone else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stay firm with the boundary you set.\n\nEdit to add: As nasty as Zeke's behavior is, I'm only suggesting some compromise with your husband. I've been in a similar situation because my husband and sister don't get along. We have had some really rough, tense moments over time and I have been caught in the middle. In the end the compromise was that I still see my sister, just not in our home. \n\nYour husband still loves his brother/family and clearly wants to see them. I wouldn't deny him that, but I would stay firm to the boundary that it's not to be in your home and that you don't want to be near Zeke at all (and for very good reasons!). I think in time your husband will come around and not be so upset with the situation. I just half to wonder if he feels caught in the middle and that is what is sparking his frustration.", "NTA. It sounds like Zeke has an issue with women in general. Probably worships at the alter of Andrew Tate. Zeke has the nerve to go into YOUR house and call you a bitch and a gold digger, and tries to convince  your husband to leave you.

I\u2019m a little suspicious that when you were footing the bill, he made it sound like you weren\u2019t.

I would send them a lovely worded email with attachments and dates, and all the way you were the bread winner and supported your husband before he had anything. And at the end, ask them if there are any additional questions.\n\nThe easier way to quiet down people like this is proof. It\u2019ll reflect back to him, and anyone agreeing, that his accusations are unfounded and obviously rooted in his own jealousy/insecurity. \n\nIf he wants to make you look like the villain, then make him look like the child he\u2019s behaving as.", "NTA- Zeke sounds like a jerk and your husband should have shut that comment down. Yes, by supporting him, he was able to grow his business and congratulations to the both of you for making it successful! \n\nHowever, you made a few comments that you admit to spending a lot. Perhaps your spending is giving off an impression. I\u2019m not saying you are a gold-digger- that logic doesn\u2019t make sense. But you are spending a lot now. You admit that.

It's her money coming back from the investment, not his. If he left at this point, I'd be arguing for and settling for nothing less than 50% if I could prove MY money built it.\n\nI am pissed at both Tom and his family. This is the sort of stuff people who are gold diggers do to someone. They would be the gold diggers, not OP. Tom took her money happily to build himself up when he was worth nothing, and now that her investment in him is paying off... isn't this also what doctors who have their nurse wives build them up through med school and residency usually do?", "I don't understand either. Basically it's that I'm now leeching off him. So I guess it's was a master plan or something? I don't get it. \n\nI will freely admit I can be a high spender, BUT it was almost always my money for so long. I did spend less at first when we changed, but once we could afford it I did go back to usual, with his knowledge.

It sounds like Zeke is jealous of their relationship/family life, or maybe he just doesn't like OP. It's mindblowing to me that her husband doesn't shut this down.

I definitely hope it's the better interpretation.", "He might be, that's better than having a reason to think it. Because I know I spend a lot, but since I was happy to use my own money I don't think it's bad. \n\nAnd yeah I've been getting overreacting and emotional from Tom and our friends. His family is more the slutty gold digger train of thought. I think both are wrong, but a part of me was worried hearing so much against me. \n\nOh I didn't realise I wrote it, I was just venting and wrote what came to head.

So if he can\u2019t be angry on your behalf (which he 100% should be), then he can at least be angry for his.", "Wait- so these \"kids\" were at least 30? 30 year old adults who aren't his responsibility and got upset that thier uncle wouldn't give them money anymore?", "Most moms aren\u2019t going to want someone who called them a bitch and a gold digger to be around their kids, even if it\u2019s a family member. That\u2019s not a healthy person for their family as a whole.", "I wouldn't want any impressionable ears around a guy who'll tell them that mommy is a dirty gold digger who baby trapped daddy. They don't understand now, but they will and it'll affect how they see OP and themselves.", ">what threat is he to her children.\n\nAdvising to take away a child from her mother for example?", "I hope it goes well. I can probably let you know how it goes but it'll probably be a while. And I definitely think he should be more upset about it, rather than just shrugging it off saying he's worried about him.", "But that\u2019s not only her decision to make.\nShe is one of two parents\u2026 they are not just her children. If she thinks they are a risk to her children enough that they shouldn\u2019t even be close then she needs to raise a complaint with the police or get an order or something.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t. Is it.\nIt\u2019s just a disagreement. He is clearly an asshole. Don\u2019t get me wrong. But my whole point is. That this is a disagreement between three adults. Yet a child is being brought into this argument and being used as leverage by one parent to force the hand of another.", "Where in the post is it being said that the uncle is sitting the kids down for story time and telling the tale of how mummy baby trapped daddy.\n\nNor is there anything in post suggesting this was done near or around the children. I\u2019m going to say this again.\n\nYou are 1/2 of the parental unit. You do not get to make unilateral decisions without more grounds than \u201cI don\u2019t want this thing\u201d.\n\nYou are not the arbiter of right and wrong for everything for your child. You have to have a discussion.\n\nIf you can\u2019t have a discussion. Then you need to be objective. Take the action that has the minimal harm.\n\nI.e in this case\u2026\n\nChoice 1: tear the children away from their father and stop them from being able to go to their fathers birthday. When asked why\u2026 what is she going to say. Because their daddy loves their uncle more than their mummy? Because this is what their daddy chose? #trauma or lie and make up some other reason sure\u2026 but the children are going to ask questions.\n\nOr option 2: mummy doesn\u2019t go and spends it with her family.\nChild is still going to have questions but they at least don\u2019t have an important memory ripped away from them. Their father isn\u2019t being punished.

If so, this\u2019ll be my last comment here and I just want to say I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019ve ever been weaponized by a parent.

We live in different states and they've been really busy so I didn't want to add to their worries.\n\nThey would almost definitely be on my side. While they still supported me (not financially), they definitely worried about TOM leeching off ME When I was younger.", "I\u2019m not young but through work I have seen the common practice of using children as tools in disputes.\n\nPeople don\u2019t realise the harm that it does. Even little things like taking them away from a family party. In the name of protecting them. When that is a lie. I\u2019m am very fortunate that I never had that growing up. But have seen it over and over again. And I have seen the harm it can cause. Children than come to think that one parent doesn\u2019t love them because they can\u2019t go to birthdays.
