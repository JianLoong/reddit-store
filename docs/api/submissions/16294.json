Let them do their typical kid thing and eat (or choose a place with a playground or activities if the kids are of that age) and let the adults just sit and talk. This gives your husband the sense of connection to his sister, gives the sister the feeling that you want to rebuild trust but can't do it all at once, and adds some time for the sister to re-learn the family dynamic. You can call it off and walk away if the time goes awry, or if it's going really well you can easily extend the time by just sitting at the restaurant longer or moving to a second location like a park or desert shop.\n\nAddiction is hard on everyone. It doesn't negate the love you have for them, but sure makes it harder to see and feel every time you wanted to believe they turned it around and find out they crashed again.

At the height of my addictions was about a $ 200-a-day habit for heroin and opiates/painkillers. Yes, I know that is a lot, and yes I did almost OD a few times. Where I was raised, there wasn't really a way of not getting introduced to these drugs. It took years away from me, my family, my friends. But I got better. It took years of therapy, group sessions, failed rehab stints, church ministry, you name it I tried it. I had to get to a point where getting out of that cycle took systems and safety measures that were put in place by my friends and family who supported my journey to get clean as well as my therapists and doctors. It took time and it took hard work from me to stay clean, absolutely, and staying clean was the choice i knew i wanted to make. But i was still sick, i relapsed more than once, but it was how my support systems and people reacted to those relapses that helped me stay clean. Addiction is a disease. You can get better with treatment sure, but if no one around you is there to hold you accountable out of love, to encourage you, to set up and KEEP the systems in place to break the cycles of addiction, addicts rarely get clean. I've lost so many friends because they went down the roads of rehab center after rehab center, methadone clinic after methadone clinic. I think its time her family understands that they may not be helping the sister in the best way.   \n\n\nI celebrated 9 years sober this year. With a kick ass wife of 3 years, the coolest daughter I could have ever asked for, and as a parent, for me, I don't want my kid to ever touch the stuff, but I know I can't protect her from the world, but at least if she does end up with the same demons as her dad, I can be there for her in ways my parents couldnt.

When in rehab, or any treatment program, whether it is 12 steps, therapy or intensives, boundaries are part of the process and the addict needs to learn them not just the ones against her, but the ones that they need to enforce to protect their sobriety. \n\nFirst, OP you are awesome for sticking to a boundary, especially to a loved one in the family - it is vital for your family safety as the main priority. \n\nBut know this..... \n\nAddicts know that they are broken, and have created great pain with their addiction creating deep guilt and shame upon them, which creates a huge reason why they want to use/numb out. They are not a bad person trying to be good, they are a sick person wanting to get well. They know that when family and friends look at them, they are looked at with heartache, anger, sadness, hurt, insert all the negative emotions here. \n\nYou are well within your rights to not allow them to stay in your home, and if I were in your shoes I would most likely do and say the same things you are - especially with your kids present. But I would hope that even though you are not allowing her in your home that you encourage your sister in law in their recovery journey, celebrate with them their victories, no matter how small they are. It would greatly help them to know that there is a support network that loves them outside of their friends in recovery. \"You hit 3 month sobriety? You rock sister, I am so proud of you.\" \"One day at a time, you got this!\" \"I hope your sponsor knows just how awesome you are.\" \"You don't have to tell me any details about your recovery, I just want to know you are doing ok, and I want YOU to know that we love you.\" Words of love and encouragement are a huge help in reducing that shame for the addict, and encourages them to keep going to their 12 step meetings, their therapy sessions, making phone calls to other recovering addicts and their sponsor. \n\nGet to learn and understand some of the process that they go through. It is not easy, and knowing that loved ones are taking the time to understand the process is a huge deal and will go a long way. \n\nBut with all that being said..... that does not mean she gets to stay at your home right now for the simple fact that you have kids in the mix and that will hurt them too much to see her in the chance that she falls back into her addiction. \n\nGood luck OP, and I hope that you and your in-laws (and hubby) are able to all come together to help the sister know that she is loved and supported, and that you ALL want her to get well, and continue to build her recovery.", "NTA.

People don't realize that getting back into the swing of mundane everyday life can be downright terrifying to an addict when they've been living at warp speed for so long with the drugs.

He is thinking ONLY of his sister while his wife has to worry about her children and herself", "I get what you are saying but the sister has other family members not just OPs husband. Sister or not his kids should be coming first and while ever he is not setting very strict boundaries all his sister is learning is brother will always forgive me. \n\nI love my brother dearly but if he repeatedly was in and out of rehab, dropping in and out of my kids lives and even stole from us. I would be having very strict boundaries because I have to focus on my two main priorities, one my kidd especially as two are disabled and two myself because if I'm not in a good place and I'm exhausted and stressed I'm absolutely not going to be doing the best I can for my kids either.\n\nAddiction is an illness and it is hard on everyone however with any toxic relationship you have to eventually go no sorry I'm done trying to prioritise you I need to step back and focus on me and the people I brought into this world.", "This!! So true. And it\u2019s really hard to stay clean when your family doesn\u2019t want you around. I also think that people use \u201cprotect the kids\u201d as an excuse to avoid accountability. Kids are far more resilient than we give them credit for. And by cutting off this relative, you are also teaching your kids to turn their back on someone while they are struggling. As someone else mentioned, maybe the boundary is not having her in your house but I don\u2019t think OP mentioned that the sister has caused harm to the kids (outside of having to explain why she\u2019s away).", "Thanks! It\u2019s sadly born of experience. My aunt recently passed away from an overdose in her enabler ex-boyfriends garage, so unfortunately I know from painful experience how important it is to set boundaries, and how damaging \u201csupporting\u201d an addict can be. \n\nOP if you are reading this, I encourage your family to see therapy collectively. There\u2019s great evidence-based family therapies out there that take a systems approach to understanding addiction! If the whole family is willing to give it a try that usually bodes really well for recovery.", "He has done more than enough showing compassion when she stole from them.  Family values when he didn\u2019t call the police when she stole from them.   He is showing absolutely no boundaries.  Wanting to allow her to come back. The wife needs to stand firm!", "There is also a lot to be said for having boundaries and teaching your kids that just because someone shares your DNA does not grant them permanent access to be a part of your life.", "I think we need more information because two times in the post OP states she doesn\u2019t want the sister in the house, and once mentions the sister \u201cstaying over.\u201d", "[bad bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136rmwf/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_his_sister_needs/jiq87i1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Thank you.", "No, I don't think that's all he's thinking at all,  he's more than likely stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I bet he has a very real fear of rejection causing a relapse.  \n\nShe can stop her coming in the house,  but she can't stop her husband having some sort of relationship with his sister", ":-(", "She does not need to stay over or set foot in the house. It's not her home, and she has ruined trust with her prior actions. \n\nActions have consequences. Sometimes ones that last a long time. Young children do not need that chaos in their safe place. Keep her out of the house.", "No he's not. His job is to protect his children, not to coddle and enable his sister. Letting her around the kids can actively harm them. He's choosing his sister over his wife and children. \n\nIt's tough when substance abuse rears its head and rips apart families. No one is saying it's easy. What people are saying is that it's time he does right by his family, that's what an adult and father should do.", "I disagree.  Why would he have gotten so mad he left?  Thinking only of his sister!", "I really hope that no one you care about ever falls victim to addiction or mental illness because you clearly lack empathy/compassion. Based off of this post, I would bet you have created far more chaos then this sister ever will.", "Because it's a difficult position to be in and being frustrated over it is very understandable. I don't think anyone is the asshole here.", "His family is absolutely the asshole here for shaming her for not letting a barely clean addict hang out with her kids. \n\nYes, it's hard, blah blah blah. Why aren't they offering her a place to live then? Why must she go live with the family member with small children? Unless they are opening their door as well, they have no room to tell someone else they must open their door to her. \n\nI've had to be this person with my husband's family. Hold the line. Do not let her in."]}
