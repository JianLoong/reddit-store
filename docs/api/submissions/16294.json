Let them do their typical kid thing and eat (or choose a place with a playground or activities if the kids are of that age) and let the adults just sit and talk. This gives your husband the sense of connection to his sister, gives the sister the feeling that you want to rebuild trust but can't do it all at once, and adds some time for the sister to re-learn the family dynamic. You can call it off and walk away if the time goes awry, or if it's going really well you can easily extend the time by just sitting at the restaurant longer or moving to a second location like a park or desert shop.\n\nAddiction is hard on everyone. It doesn't negate the love you have for them, but sure makes it harder to see and feel every time you wanted to believe they turned it around and find out they crashed again.

At that point cutting her out until she stayed clean seemed easier because if I let her around then my nephews would end up in traditional foster care. It sucked. My family called me every name under the sun for sticking up for the kids and not letting her around. \n\nShe finally hit rock bottom. She went to in patient rehab, then moved into a donor living house and completed outpatient rehab. She stayed in the house for another year before she was stable enough to live on her own.

At the height of my addictions was about a $ 200-a-day habit for heroin and opiates/painkillers. Yes, I know that is a lot, and yes I did almost OD a few times. Where I was raised, there wasn't really a way of not getting introduced to these drugs. It took years away from me, my family, my friends. But I got better. It took years of therapy, group sessions, failed rehab stints, church ministry, you name it I tried it. I had to get to a point where getting out of that cycle took systems and safety measures that were put in place by my friends and family who supported my journey to get clean as well as my therapists and doctors. It took time and it took hard work from me to stay clean, absolutely, and staying clean was the choice i knew i wanted to make. But i was still sick, i relapsed more than once, but it was how my support systems and people reacted to those relapses that helped me stay clean. Addiction is a disease. You can get better with treatment sure, but if no one around you is there to hold you accountable out of love, to encourage you, to set up and KEEP the systems in place to break the cycles of addiction, addicts rarely get clean. I've lost so many friends because they went down the roads of rehab center after rehab center, methadone clinic after methadone clinic. I think its time her family understands that they may not be helping the sister in the best way.   \n\n\nI celebrated 9 years sober this year. With a kick ass wife of 3 years, the coolest daughter I could have ever asked for, and as a parent, for me, I don't want my kid to ever touch the stuff, but I know I can't protect her from the world, but at least if she does end up with the same demons as her dad, I can be there for her in ways my parents couldnt.

When in rehab, or any treatment program, whether it is 12 steps, therapy or intensives, boundaries are part of the process and the addict needs to learn them not just the ones against her, but the ones that they need to enforce to protect their sobriety. \n\nFirst, OP you are awesome for sticking to a boundary, especially to a loved one in the family - it is vital for your family safety as the main priority. \n\nBut know this..... \n\nAddicts know that they are broken, and have created great pain with their addiction creating deep guilt and shame upon them, which creates a huge reason why they want to use/numb out. They are not a bad person trying to be good, they are a sick person wanting to get well. They know that when family and friends look at them, they are looked at with heartache, anger, sadness, hurt, insert all the negative emotions here. \n\nYou are well within your rights to not allow them to stay in your home, and if I were in your shoes I would most likely do and say the same things you are - especially with your kids present. But I would hope that even though you are not allowing her in your home that you encourage your sister in law in their recovery journey, celebrate with them their victories, no matter how small they are. It would greatly help them to know that there is a support network that loves them outside of their friends in recovery. \"You hit 3 month sobriety? You rock sister, I am so proud of you.\" \"One day at a time, you got this!\" \"I hope your sponsor knows just how awesome you are.\" \"You don't have to tell me any details about your recovery, I just want to know you are doing ok, and I want YOU to know that we love you.\" Words of love and encouragement are a huge help in reducing that shame for the addict, and encourages them to keep going to their 12 step meetings, their therapy sessions, making phone calls to other recovering addicts and their sponsor. \n\nGet to learn and understand some of the process that they go through. It is not easy, and knowing that loved ones are taking the time to understand the process is a huge deal and will go a long way. \n\nBut with all that being said..... that does not mean she gets to stay at your home right now for the simple fact that you have kids in the mix and that will hurt them too much to see her in the chance that she falls back into her addiction. \n\nGood luck OP, and I hope that you and your in-laws (and hubby) are able to all come together to help the sister know that she is loved and supported, and that you ALL want her to get well, and continue to build her recovery.", "NTA.

People don't realize that getting back into the swing of mundane everyday life can be downright terrifying to an addict when they've been living at warp speed for so long with the drugs.

It's important to talk through things calmly with him and without either of you being heated, discuss in detail the specifics of both of your concerns. \n\nIts important to make sure that you both have each other's backs.

I suggest a conversation between you, your husband, and her that sets boundaries and expectations in a firm yet compassionate way. If you're worried about her relapsing in the future, maybe NA or AA meetings are a good place to start. A good sponsor could really increase the chances of remaining in recovery and also making sure a relapse doesn't snowball into more harmful patterns. If there are underlying mental health issues then maybe therapy could be another useful tool for her to have. Maybe some precautions could be necessary (supervised visits with the kids for X time or until X milestone is reached, no overnight visits or locking away valuables discreetly if overnight visits are allowed, etc).

I\u2019ve worked with substance abusers and have advocated for them to get their kids back, but it has to be done delicately and with time and recovery factors considered, as every time they have their kids removed it\u2019s another punch in the face to their attachment and likelihood of good outcomes as adults.

I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that addicts will do what they have to do in order to get what they want, but if they themselves are not ready to get clean then they most likely are not going to stay clean.

Her mother (my step sister), went from the bat of just beating on her husband for no apparent reason, to drinking at work (a factory) and cheating on her husband.

How she hasn't killed somebody, I honestly don't know, but I am thankful that she hasn't taken the life of somebody else due to her addiction. She started telling her daughter that she's sleeping around with other men to get her a sibling. I hope to God she doesn't get pregnant because that poor child is going to have fetal alcohol syndrome.\nAddiction is no joke. It's serious and people can go eight months and relapse. People go years and relapse, but the longer they're in recovery, the less likely they are to relapse.

Imagine a simple scenario, like you smoked your whole life but there was a certain group of people who rejected you because of this but you really wanted them to be part of your life, so you try to quit and drop the habit but they still reject you, to an addict that's a pretty good turning point of I want them to accept me so I tried to fix it, but they still want nothing to do with me.

Came to find he'd mixed with alcohol, and once another roommate yelled at him, he took off in his car...calling the police was the hardest thing in the world for me to do, but it saved his life and many other lives, I believe.\n\nWhen our friend group (and his sister, who'd just had a new baby) cut him off and stopped helping him, he finally had to face the consequences of his actions. Other terrible things happened when he was enabled again, which ended up with him in the hospital, almost dying, then in and out of jail/inpatient care for over a decade.\n\nHe approached me many times trying to apologize to get me to take him back as a friend, but I refused, until one day I heard from his mom that he'd been clean, out of jail, and on meds for almost a year. I spoke to him that day for hours, told him I was proud, and for him to keep going. I talk to him every so often, usually on birthdays when we tell one another 'happy birthday' or when he messages randomly...but while I accepted his apology, I could never fully forgive him because of all the times he took advantage of me, my parents, our friends--and I also feel guilty for enabling him for so long. In this case, you have the chance to not do what I did. Nip it in the bud and not let her destroy everything and everyone in her life.\n\nDon't let your husband and his family enable her. 7 months is a long time, but relapsing may have happened due to giving her too much slack (via friends or fam, sorry if I'm incorrect here, just an assumption). She needs to realize that, in order to have a good, healthy, loving life with her family and nephews, she has to pick herself up and prove to everyone that she has changed, or else it's just overall dangerous to have her in your home, even after 7 months, because she's never made it further.\n\nJust like the show Intervention, an ultimatum needs to be given (in my opinion)\n\nTough love is not evil or hurtful. It could save her life, and it gives her a goal to meet. Maybe giving her milestones and 'rewards' would help to motivate, to remind her that you guys are proud and love her, but I think you're doing the right thing.\n\nSorry for the wall of text and a (probably) unwanted story dropped onto you lol--I felt it relevant.", "I grew up with some addict family members and we were always allowed to see them but with certain rules in place.

I 27(M) have a brother 35(M) who was on hard drugs for more than 10 years. My brother often used me as a teenager to steal pills from my mother in order to feed his habit, I've found drugs, needles, spoons you name it in his room over the years. He was always a Yo-Yo addict, \"I'm clean I promise\". I've seen it all and done it all. Used, stolen from, let down and more. The pain of our relationship will be with me forever...... But I never stopped loving my brother, I stopped enabling him early on and was ALWAYS an obstacle for him. Eventually I moved out of my parents when I was 17 and didn't look back I was tired of my family enabling him and allowing him to steal, cheat, lie, and hurt us. After many years my brother did get clean, seriously clean. It took me more than a year to trust he was telling the truth about his sobriety and probably another year before I trusted him completely. It's now been almost three years and I'm the closest I've ever been with my brother. Like I said I never ever stopped loving my brother, I also NEVER kept my children from him. He always was a good uncle, he loved and cared for his nieces and nephews as his own and would do anything for them. Just because someone is an addict, which is a mental illness does not indicate a danger to your family.
