It's perfectly acceptable to need to see a bit more progress in her recovery before you bring her into your home", "NTA. It sounds like she\u2019s had more than one  chance and she\u2019s relapsed. At this point you need to put your family\u2019s mental health and well being first.", "NTA\n\nYour children deserve someone who is consistent in their lives. An addict cannot be that. A recovering addict can. But if she's shown relapse, then absolutely make that boundary of a year - and stick to it. Your children don't deserve to be hurt because his family wants to cheer up his sister - your children are not there to be an emotional support. She needs to clean up her act or she doesn't need to see them.", "NTA I wouldn't let anyone with any past into my house again after they stole from me.", "NTA. Your husband is using your kids-- and therefore the risk that they'll get hurt or harmed by Aunt's behaviors-- as both a reward and as a stake to be lost. That they're a stake to be lost even shows that he knows there's a risk of harm to the kids and he's so far gone he doesn't even register it as harm anymore.\n\nI'd maybe point those things out to him, so far as his enabling and codependence-- that he's tempting his kids into a riptide because he doesn't realize he's been drowning so long he's living underwater.", "NTA.

I'm sorry you're going through that. It's very hard, but you need to protect your family from getting dragged into your SIL's problems.

I hope she can stay clean and come back.", "NTA - it\u2019s your responsibility to put your family first and that\u2019s what your doing", "NTA.

Because while the message itself isn't unreasonable, there's a big difference between compassionately stating a boundary for the safety of the family while still acknowledging SIL's hard work and desire to let her into your lives when she's more stable versus implying your husband's no-good sister isn't allowed anywhere near you until she proves herself worthy", "NTA. If someone stole from me I would never let them in my house again.", "NTA - addiction is a disease but that doesn\u2019t negate her actions have consequences.

It\u2019s hard to live with an addict and it\u2019s hard on kids who will be hurt if the addict goes back to using and stealing and lying. I would not let a freshly sober addict near my kids let alone move in.", "NTA - i sympathize with addicts and their road to recovery. However, one thing they need to do is accept the wrongs they have committed and that not everyone will just forgive them because they started their journey. I think its a great compromise that you are willing to allow her back into your life when she has proven she has stayed clean for a set amount of time and the 1 year mark is great. When she celebrates her first year clean she will be around more people that love her and have started their journey for forgiveness as well. That is my take at least.", "Info - honestly theres not enough to judge, and dont know if there ever will be a *right* answer here, but I think the whats best will be a dialogue and communication with your spouse about this.", "NTA at all. Be a jerk 100x over versus exposing your kids to an addict. Being an enabler is FAR worse than being a jerk. Due to your husbands enabling you might want to consider nanny cameras throughout the house before she visits.", "NTA because she stole from you but as far as being in the kids\u2019 lives\u2014not every adult they meet is going to be a constant. So maybe let go of that requirement. We live far away from our nieces so we aren\u2019t a constant presence (and they are my partner\u2019s siblings\u2019 kids so I don\u2019t even talk to them that much) but we have a good time when we see them. I know it\u2019s a little different because it\u2019s not addiction related\u2014but she\u2019s not an addict *at* you. \n\nMaybe you can explore seeing her away from your house? It\u2019s more casual to the kids and safer for you. She is your husband\u2019s sister after all.", "NTA\n\nYou are right to want to protect your kids. Ignore anyone, including your husband, who says otherwise.", "NTA put her in an oxford house. It'll do her some good", "NTA - it is a reasonable boundary. Maybe suggest some neutral places you can meet, like a park or zoo.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour right 2 months is too short. Not to mention say she relapses and brings drugs or shady partners around to your house. And say they get into some legal trouble and her residence is your home. CPS has grounds to come in. Ask your husband is being a brother more important than being a father?", "NTA\n\nA year isn\u2019t long at all\u2026.\n\nOnce they became an addict I would\u2019ve gone NC. Once an addict, always an addict. Protect your kids.", "Kinda TA. \n\nCompletely understand your pov from a parents perspective, and also understand it from a family members perspective who had to deal with the same craziness.\n\nThat being said, recovery is an on going process that she will never be done with. Relapses are bound to happen. What's important is a strong foundation. And remembering this is your husband's sister, who whether he admits it or not is probably one of the closest friends he's had in his life. \n\n12 months isn't exactly a long span of time for an acquaintance, but family is a very sensitive topic for a lot of people. I'd suggest setting some reasonable boundaries and maybe going from 12 months maybe down to 6 with those parameters\n\n*edit* I misunderstood the post, and thought it meant contact in general.
