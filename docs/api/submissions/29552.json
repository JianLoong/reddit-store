He wants to spend time with my kids which is awesome and I want my kids to have a good relationship with him, but I don't feel comfortable with him being alone with my kids. \n\n\nMy reasons:\n\n\n- he is not a safe driver. 4 car wrecks. He brake checks, flips off, and chases cars.\n\n\n- he carries c*caine with him. Hes resisted arrest before and I worry about what will happen to my kids if he is pulled over.\n\n\n- Kids in my wife's family cry and run away when he comes around. I heard one of the moms say \"BIL, what did you do to my daughter?\" When commenting about how her daughter was behaving around him.\n\n\nI've told my wife my reasons, but the last 2 times that he came into town, he made plans for him to have our kids and my wife agreed to them without asking me. The first time she didn't realize how serious it was to me. The second time, she forgot. This time, I reminded her and she is following through with it. \n\n\nWe've talked about this and agreed that if one parent feels unsafe, that should be enough. She felt same with my mom having the kids alone and I kept that boundary with my mom for years.\n\n\nThis has been hard on my wife. He is stubborn and usually gets his way and is difficult when he doesn't. She did her best to suggest things that they can all do together, but he refused any idea that wasn't him having alone time with each kid. This is a red flag for me. I could be reading more into it than what's there, but his insistence added to how other kids act around him just gives me a bad feeling. \n\n\nShe told him that I had plans for the kids on that day. This wasnt true, but I am fine with the blame being on me since it's me that has the issue. He told my SIL that he gets the feeling that we dont trust him with the kids.\n\n\nHe has been really short with my wife and he has declined every invitation to come spend time with the kids. Tonight, he was invited to come over to carve pumpkins with the kids, but didn't show up. My wife had a panic attack because she feels like she's stuck in the middle of this. I let her know that im sorry she has to go through this and how grateful I am she is enforcing this boundary.\n\n\nShe trusts her brother and thinks that his reasoning for wanting to be alone with them is because he didn't have a good relationship with his uncle. I just don't understand. If he wants to have a good relationship with the kids, why is he declining to do anything with the kids unless it's 1-on-1 time?\n\n\nI feel like an AH because she is stressed, having panic attacks, and this has affected her relationship with family. Am I the AH? Are my reasons valid or am I just being paranoid? Should I salvage this and let him take my kids before this blows up and causes a rift in the family?", "created_utc": 1698121410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17f4cfs/aita_for_not_wanting_my_bil_to_be_alone_with_my/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your BIL is a predator.  Insisting on being alone with your kids and being tempermental when he doesn't get his own way are huge red flags.  His drug use and disregard for other people's boundaries make him unsafe as well. Your wife seems afraid to upset him and has trouble saying no to him, which is not safe for your kids. You'd be better off severing contact with him.", "NTA.\n\nYikes! Any of your points, alone, would be more than enough reason to not let him be alone with your kids!\n\nI think it is bizarre and very suspicious that he is so fixed on aloneness, and won't come to family events. His comment about his uncle is utterly unpersuasive.", "Your wife feels \u2018stuck in the middle\u2019 so I suggest you ask her WHY she\u2019s decided to be in the middle, as opposed to: \u2018I\u2019m not on the side of the drug dealing/taking, dangerous driving man who works consistently to isolate and be alone with children, that other children are scared of?\u2019\n\nAsk her to explain the merits of her brother\u2019s position. If she can see both sides, then what\u2019s his? \n\nI\u2019m genuinely blown away here. He refuses to be in settings where he doesn\u2019t have unsupervised access to young children? That\u2019s something she thinks is ok? She thinks it has equal weight with wanting kids to be safe and she can defensibly be on the fence about? \n\nThe rest of the family doesn\u2019t want a rift? If you won\u2019t create a rift with someone who behaves like this, then god only knows what they think crosses the line. \n\nNTA, and wife needs some professional help.", "Hell no.  I can't imagine why your wife thinks it's okay for your kids to be in a car with this guy.  Also, anyone who demands time alone with your kids is probably the last person on earth who should get alone time with them. \n\nYour wife needs therapy (assertiveness training) to learn to say no without having a panic attack. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nGo with your gut. Don\u2019t ever leave your kids with your BIL.\n\n>He declined every invitation to come spend time with the kids\n\nYeah, he doesn\u2019t want to be around them where you might catch on to his creepiness.

They don\u2019t know how to describe it beyond fear/terror. **Please listen to their cries for help**. It may save your own children.\n\nUnder NO circumstances let your BIL have and private time with your kids. The more I reread your post, the more clear it became.\n\nYou should ask your wife\u2019s family\u2019s parents why their kids are so scared. If they confirm your fears, spread the news far and wide and excommunicate him from the family. Just make sure you\u2019re  \ud83d\udcaf% certain.\n\nI say this because I have a friend who was molested by a relative that folks knew had done bad things to others, but it was a closely held secret. They didn\u2019t want to bring shame to the family so they let him assault 2 other girls over many months.", "NTA but I'd worry about what kind of family dynamics your wife grew up in when she is so stressed about putting her own children's safety above her brother's plans given all the safety concerns you listed.\n\nAlso top of the list should be that other parents have questioned what he did with her child because of her kid's behaviour afterwards. That is fucked up. This family is providing cover for him and it's weird. Your wife needs to really think about this whole thing and why she is finding it difficult to protect her kids.", "Ok, so I only read about the first 1/3 of your post before I felt the need to stop and ask, you want your kids to have a good relationship with this guy? Alone or not, wtf?", "\ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 so many red flags with this man. Who the hell insists on being alone with other peoples children??? \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \n\nNTA and your wife needs to grow a backbone it\u2019s concerning she would potentially endanger your children in order to keep the peace.", "NTA\n\nThe brother in law sounds very manipulative, and like a total weirdo.\n\nHonestly, I am a little worried you need reassurance about this and he is able to even influence you a little bit. These are YOUR kids, not his. Their safety is in YOUR hands, not his. If your BIL molested them, you would never forgive yourself, you would never forgive your wife for influencing you to allow him around them, and your kids lives would be ruined.\n\nYou are never the AH when it comes to protecting your kids from weirdos. Your BIL is an adult. He is acting like a manipulative, petulant child. He is a full grown man and the way he feels about things have nothing to do with you or your kids.\n\nFull grown adults understand the importance of a child's safety, and they understand the importance of making parents feel secure. A full grown adult wanting to spend 1 on 1 time with someone else's children, and making a big fuss when they aren't allowed to, is not normal. That is predatory behavior. If I were you, I would never allow him to be around my kids ever, and I wouldn't care how he felt about it. Your BIL does not sound like a good person who you should allow into your life.\n\nYou should not feel like an asshole for protecting your children from what sounds like a manipulative predator. These are your children and their safety is in your hands.\n\nAlso, the fact that he acts like a manipulative predator is NOT your fault. That's his fault. \"I am angry at you that you feel uncomfortable with how I'm acting around your kids!\" ...uhhh then maybe don't at that way? That's his fault. \n\nThis is more than you asked for but I would encourage you to check out the books \"When I Say No, I Feel Guilty\" and \"No More Mr. Nice Guy.\" I know the titles sound cringe, but they are very good for helping people who are kind and empathetic work on assertiveness.", "NTA. So if he can't have alone time with the kids, he doesn't want to see your family at all? And other kids he's been around cry and run away from him. WTH. **Don't even let him in the door.** Why is this even a question? \n\nDid he abuse your wife too for his amusement when they were growing up? \n\nAnd FYI you don't need \"alone time\" to create a good relationship. I'm creeped out just reading this.", "Your BIL sounds like a predator, have you by chance ever looked up if has a record? \nYou should stop at a funeral home to give the brochure to your wife and if you both watch tv then perfect time to watch forensic shows and crime dramas. It sounds odd but people become very blind about some things or never knew something like that can happen. Those shows can help people to become more aware.", "NTA and your wife is insane to trust her brother with your kids before they are...at least adults or he changes dramatically.  I don't need the explanation of the third bullet point for that, the second is enough (but note that you could control for the first by not letting him actually drive them anywhere).", "NTA - Safety of the kids always come first. If you're not comfortable with him being with your kids, then you have every right to protect them.", "NTA. No one needs alone time with your children. Listen to your instincts.", "Not TA!\n\nIf having your children in the car with a c\\*ke head with multiple accidents and run-ins with cops isn't enough the surely, I would imagine, the possibility that he may have harmed other kids and insists that \"alone time\" is necessary to form meaningful relationships would be the only red flag needed.\n\nIf protecting your children from this guy causes a rift in the family, then they are not the kind of family that deserves to be in the children's lives.", "NTA but what is wrong with your wife?", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat planet is your wife on that she would trust a cocaine carrying, horrible driving, potential child mistreater? Did he do something to her? Because her defense of him is sus at the minimum.", "NTA I think it is really wierd he is so insisted on having alone time with the children.", "NTA. I would NEVER allow my child to be with someone so unsafe. The only thing I think, though, is that maybe you should be straight with him that until he cleans.up.his act, he will never be alone with your kids.", "This needs to be a strong boundary. You should also teach your kids know that he is not a safe adult and they should not be alone with him. Your wife is delusional if she isn't listening to the other parents and kids about his behavior. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Get your wife a good therapist, now. She needs help with this, and she needs help protecting your kids. She's probably been taught by her family to bow to his wishes (given that he \"usually gets his way\") and doesn't see how *incredibly* dangerous he is.", "Someone needs to talk to the other kids in your family and make sure he didn\u2019t do anything shady with them. That guy is nothing but a walking red flag. Stick to your guns, OP. Don\u2019t let that man around your children.", "Who in their right mind would hand their child over to a reckless driving drug user? Seriously? Your wife doesn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings? Wow.

It\u2019s totally understandable why you don\u2019t want him around your kids alone but I\u2019d also tell him straight up rather than have my wife coming up with lies and having panic attacks because she feels stick in the middle.", "NTA!!

Seriously any of your points individually would be enough for you to want to keep your kids away from this man, all of them combined should have you questioning having him involved with your family in any manner whatsoever.  \n\nCocaine is a scheduled 2 drug, if he is at your house there are so many risk with that alone, from your kids accidentally getting a hold of it to the police showing up and a shoot first ask questions later situation.

Your wife however needs a reality check, I had a parent who put their family over our safety and I can tell you that impacted our health growing up on a large scale. \n\nWe could sit and list all the reasons, but the biggest red flag is his insistence at alone time with the kids and throwing a fit when he doesn't get his way. I won't jump the gun by saying predatory behaviour, but it's certainly bordering on it.\n\nYou need to have a sit down as parents and a married couple and become a united front, trust your gut.", "NTA. It's your job to protect your kids, and that's what you're doing. It is not your job to appease others so that *they* are not uncomfortable. They can figure that out themselves. You are doing the right thing, by standing strong against even the slightest possibility of harm to your kids.", "Wow, NTA. WTF is wrong with your wife? Why isn\u2019t she willing to prioritize protecting her own children over her cokehead predator of a brother? Considering what other kids and moms in the family have said about him, it\u2018s clear he cannot be trusted. Who gives a f how mad he gets? Your wife should be ashamed of herself for failing to step up for her kids.\n\nIn any case, I\u2019d say it\u2019s time for you to take the initiative and shut him down. To do so, you need to ignore your wife\u2019s hand-wringing BS for now and deal directly with your BIL. Call him up and let him know that if he wants to see your kids it will be with you present, or not at all.

And make sure you are ready to back up those words with actions. And to be clear, I did not say anything about violence \u2014 there are a lot of ways to set a hard boundary with a difficult person. If it means enlisting the help of friends, or other dads in the family, then do that. For the sake of all the kids in the family. Step. Up.", "Also, why does she think she needs to occupy a middle ground? This is an important question. She needs to be 100% on the side of her children\u2019s safety. If she doesn\u2019t feel safe saying no to her brother, and facing his reactions to her disagreement, that should be proof enough that he isn\u2019t safe around her children, with or without supervision.", "All.of.this. BIL is creating the rift by pitching a hissy fit over completely reasonable boundaries. He\u2019s acting like he has some weird right to be alone with the children. Enormous red flag. OP you are keeping your kids safe and that\u2019s the priority. Make this your hill to die on.", "Well said, no offense to OP but there seems to be a lack of assertiveness in this household.", "Yes! Gigantic red flags the size of Texas! Your BIL\u2019s insistence on alone time *only* with the kids is EXTREMELY off! He\u2019s clearly not interested in actually spending time with the kids because he declines to see them otherwise. \n\nMy gut says HELL to the NAW! \n\nKeep that BIL away from your kids! Then ask your wife how that doesn\u2019t bring up red flags for her? Ask her to explain to you why exclusive alone time with BIL and kids is ok with her. Ask her to justify his behavior in her mind because it\u2019s just super super weird."]}
