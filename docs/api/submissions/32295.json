I have a 21 YO son who is mildly on the autism spectrum and who I raised mostly alone. Husband has an 18 YO son and a 12 YO daughter who he raises 50/50. \nI work full time. Husband is a part time student who lives off some family investments. He owns the house we live in. We keep finances separate mostly. \n\nWe all lived together as a family for several years until my son left for university 3 years ago and it has been mostly easy. We\u2019ve been lucky - all the kids are nice - although we\u2019ve had a few disagreements about parenting styles and tolerance. \nMy son now has a girlfriend (18) who he lives with.  She has gone no contact with her mum - who I believe is bi polar and angry - and didn\u2019t really know her dad. The girlfriend seems nice but has some mental health issues which she gets help for. She seems to love my son and make him happy. \n\nThis year for xmas my son asked if his GF could stay with us- otherwise my son won\u2019t be able to join us as he doesn\u2019t want to leave her alone. My husband finds having people stay over very stressful - it causes anxiety - so said no. My husbands been dealing with his own mental health issues for the last year so I understand that but it puts me in a tricky spot with my son. \nI have said that I would want to join my son at his house to help cook and make a fuss if they can\u2019t come here. My son says that would mean a lot to him as it feels more family ish. My husband is very upset about this and doesn\u2019t want me to go. \n\nI tried to offer a compromise to my son of paying for an Airbnb for them nearby to sleep at whilst spending xmas day with us - but he says the GF feels unwelcome and awkward now. \nI have told my husband I might still go to them for Christmas. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect this to be an issue as my husband doesn\u2019t like Christmas. His kids will come to us after 2pm from their mums, open presents and then do their own thing until dinner - which is traditionally chicken schnitzel in their family. My husband loves to cook for his kids and cooks nearly all the food in our home (lucky me). My husband is very upset that I\u2019d go elsewhere for Christmas Day and wants me to be with him and his kids. He\u2019s being very unhappy for days and making it clear I\u2019ll be letting him down if I go. \n\nI know I\u2019m a part of their family and my son is a grown up but he\u2019s still my son and I feel torn. My son can\u2019t leave his GF alone but wants to see me, husband isn\u2019t comfortable for her to stay, she feels too rejected to stay nearby and visit and my husband feels I should be with him for Christmas. I\u2019m just stuck! I want everyone to be happy.", "created_utc": 1701640033, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18a4bmm/wibta_if_i_went_to_my_adult_sons_for_christmas/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband is wanting his cake and eat it too if he doesn\u2019t want your son to come home with his gf and he doesn\u2019t want you to go to visit your son.  That is very unfair of him.  He wants Christmas with his kids but is willing to deny you Christmas with your kid. If it were me, I would go see my son and my husband would have to just get over it.  If he isn\u2019t willing to compromise then the decision falls to you to do what you want.  Happy Holidays and I hope you get to visit your son and your husband is able to understand.", "NTA. Your husband shouldn't be guilt tripping you about going to see your son. He didn't want your son's gf to come, your son wasn't going to leave her, and I can't really blame her for feeling unwanted when your husband explicitly doesn't want her there. You can't please everyone and the 55 year old man can take a damn breath and come to terms with not everything being the way he wants it this year.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your husband\u2019s anxiety, but he created this situation by saying your son\u2019s girlfriend couldn\u2019t stay. Of course you want your child, even your adult child, to feel loved and included on Christmas. Your husband is an adult too, but he had the power to avoid this situation.", "You should tell your husband he is creating the problem either way you go.  I have a grown son too and I haven\u2019t seen my side of the family in 8 years because I always have to cook for his side of the family. It is very unfair. My son and his wife came last week and everything my son did he griped about. I would tell him either he makes your son and girlfriend feel comfortable being at your house and staying over or he lets you go stay with them for the holiday and make him choose the solution", "NTA\n\n\nI hope you have an amazing Christmas with your son :)", "NTA.  It\u2019s normal that when a couple moves in together they would stay together and your husband is basically pushing them away.  Go be with your son.", "NTA. Your children are more important than any second husband. Have a great Christmas with your son! You can always get another husband. One of the many reasons a second marriage can really be a problem.", "NTA - you're in a really tricky situation. with that many mental health issues involved, its going to be near impossible to make everyone happy.\n\nhowever, he can't just expect you to neglect your kid. nor can he expect family christmas to never change - kids bringing around their partners for christmas is a very normal thing to happen as they grow older. I understand that it gives him anxiety, but I'd still venture he needs to learn to cope with this. would he tell his own kids their parners can't come over for christmas? if no hes being a hypocrite, if yes, he needs serious help to overcome his anxiety.", "**NTA but your husband caused this rift.** As kids grow they have partners and want them included. I swear we\u2019ve had different girlfriends for Christmas with my older son until he found the latest one who\u2019s been with hime 3 years. \n\nHusband can cook for his kids. You cook for your son at his place. Don\u2019t under any circumstances abandon him at this time and let your husband know that this is the only option as you will not neglect your son in favor of his kids. You asked for all to be together and he said no.", "Nta. I find the first part completely reasonable. I am also on the spectrum, and well, strangers in the house overwhelm the f out of me. But you going out should not be a problem, especially when he is the one who cooks at Christmas. So he is not missing out on anything. And if he thinks he is, he should go with you to your son's house.", "Do you think it would change your husband\u2019s mind if you both had dinner or met a few times before Christmas? I\u2019m unsure from your post if he said no because she\u2019s a stranger, or rather that he never wants people to stay\u2026", "NTA. If your husband can't show any whisper of Christnas spirit and welcome your son's gf there to stay, he doesn't get to sulk if you want to go there to see your son.  This is on him  he is being selfish. And also showing some unpleasant tendencies towards your son. \n\nGo see your son. Husband is being a dick.", "Your husband gets to choose (1) son and gf at his home or (2) you at sons place\n\nHe can\u2019t put himself first in every scenario.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He said no to your son's girlfriend so now she doesn't feel welcome in the home. Husband is going to spend some of the day with his own kids so you should be able to do the same. His anxiety may be driving him to not want to be alone for the holiday but that's something a 55yr father and husband needs to learn to deal with.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make this decision; your husband made the decision when he said he didn\u2019t want them to stay over. I can totally understand the GF not feeling welcome at this point.\n\nYour husband may have his own mental health issues, but I think in this case it\u2019s ok to say, \u201cthis is what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nGo be with your son and his GF and make some great memories with them. I think you will regret it if you don\u2019t.", "NTA but you would be TA if you ditch your son on Christmas because your husband won\u2019t let him and his gf come. Also, when your husband\u2019s son goes to university do you think he\u2019d keep the same policy if it meant his son wouldn\u2019t be able to come?", "NTA you\u2019re an adult we should all get to spend the holidays where we want with who we want. Your husband can compromise or miss you. He could have had you for Christmas if he\u2019d been willing to host.", "NTA.  Your husband won't allow your son in his house for Christmas.  HIS decision.  You don't want your son with no family on Christmas so you will spend the holiday with him. I don't blame the gf for feeling like she is not wanted at your house. An AirBNB is very different from staying with family for a holiday.\n\nI don't know how far away your son lives but could you go for Christmas Eve and morning and return for dinner with your husband and his kids?", "Thank you so much to everyone who has spent the time to comment. I\u2019ve been feeling a bit lost and was beginning to feel I couldn\u2019t do anything right here. Your comments have helped me feel more comfortable with my Xmas choice x", "NTA. How long has your husband hated your son?", "I think because your husband isn't willing to let your son's girlfriend come, then the two of you need to find a compromise.\n\nThis is going to come up again and again, though. If it's not your son's girlfriend, it will be his kids' partners.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the girlfriend feels too unwelcome to stay in an Airbnb with your son, because that would have been the perfect arrangement. When we used to have big holidays at my parents' house, they rented a nearby place for  some of the family to stay in, and it was tremendous fun.\n\nBut for now, it seems the only possible compromise is for you to visit your son. I'm sorry for your husband, but he'll have his kids with him so he will be okay.\n\nNTA. Happy Holidays!", "INFO did your husband change his mind, or did you invite son and gf before you brought it up to your husband?", "NTA", "NTA, and sorry but it seems like he is trying to alienate your son.", ">he says the GF feels unwelcome and awkward now. \n\nNAH between you, husband, and son. I think the GF is the problem here. She has an invite to stay FREE at an AirBnB and join you on Christmas Day, but can't be happy with that. I don't think you should accommodate that further by going to see your son and leaving the rest of your family on Christmas.", "Son is not doing too good managing his gf and his moms relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's your and your son's holiday too.", "Ask your husband what will happen when his kids want to bring someone home for Christmas. Is he going to tell them that they can't??", "Nta You sound like a very kind person. Ultimately, your child is asking for their mother. It sounds like he's willing to do just about anything to see you. Your husband seems determined to cut him out. That is being a crappy stepparent and his mental health isn't an excuse for denying you time with your child. \n\nGo be with your son and have a Merry Christmas.", "NTA  If he wants to spend it with you then he can go with you.

It sucks that you're stuck in the middle and your husband should be more understanding.", "What\u2019s right is for him to not pitch a fit that you want to spend some part of the holiday with your own child.

It sucks for trying to make Christmas plans, but I get it, you know? \nThe Airbnb compromise was ideal and while I understand her initial reaction, it would be nice if she could trust and accept it\u2019s not personal. \n\nAll that said, the situation is kind of a mess (standard Christmas scheduling mess tbh - everyone competing for the 25th and you can only be in one place at a time) and you\u2019re fine to decide what you want to do. It\u2019s also fine for your husband to be a bit upset about it.\n\nI say, do whatever you want, try not to stress too much, and let everyone else just deal with it.", "He specifically doesn't want her to stay over. There's nothing in the post that says she's unwelcome as a daytime guest for Christmas.", "Exactly. OP your husband is making a choice as well. I get the anxiety, but we are talking *one* person, a person your son adores and your husband needs to get used to being around regardless. I have *terrible* anxiety with strangers, and am in my house overnight it's even worse, but I sure as hell wouldn't do what your husband is doing under those circumstances. I would push through and get to know and be comfortable with her. He married you, your son is part of the package and so are his loved ones. Your husband needs to make the effort, even if it isn't his son he is yours and he needs to understand he a priority in your life, even as an adult.", "She IS welcome as a daytime guest for Christmas - I\u2019ve offered to cover the cost of a nearby Airbnb for them to sleep at - but the whole situation has made the GF feel uncomfortable and an Airbnb feels like a bit of a rejection to her."]}
