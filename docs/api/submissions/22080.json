You didn\u2019t say your nephew is an asshole or you want to cut contact with him so just let the parents know that this is THEIR circus and he is THEIR monkey abd THEY can feed him from now on. No exceptions.", "NTA. The parents should have told you if he only eats McDonald's. That is a big thing to leave out. If they bring it up again, tell them you are sorry they forgot to tell you that information and since you had dinner already planned hopefully your nephew liked trying something new. \n\nI'm not going to get into how limiting this is to his future socializing or his health.", "NTA.

I'm not an expert on parenting or child diets but isn't it considered bad for a kid to have fast food every night instead of a square meal? unless they can't afford a healthy meal, that's a different story. either way, still, when you're babysitting, the kid eats what you make them, noting of course any allergies or diet restrictions. \n\nand even if they wanted you to feed him mcdonalds, they should've told you ahead of time instead of expect you to believe a child who says \"I eat mcdonalds every night for dinner\"", "What lazy parents feed their child McDonald's every night?

Eating Macca's every night is just plain McWrong.", "I'm confused, if they eat Maccy Ds every night and then they went to someone elses for dinner and were served chicken and gravy and veg, would they refuse to eat it? \n\nOf course not. This is bizarre. What you get to eat at home and what is provided for you at someone else's is not equal or the same. Eat what you want at home, be grateful for someone else making you dinner when you are out. \n\nParents are a joke. Ask your SIL why she buys an 9 year old Maccy Ds every night.", "Right on.
