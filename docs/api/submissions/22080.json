You didn\u2019t say your nephew is an asshole or you want to cut contact with him so just let the parents know that this is THEIR circus and he is THEIR monkey abd THEY can feed him from now on. No exceptions.", "NTA. The parents should have told you if he only eats McDonald's. That is a big thing to leave out. If they bring it up again, tell them you are sorry they forgot to tell you that information and since you had dinner already planned hopefully your nephew liked trying something new. \n\nI'm not going to get into how limiting this is to his future socializing or his health.", "NTA.

I'm not an expert on parenting or child diets but isn't it considered bad for a kid to have fast food every night instead of a square meal? unless they can't afford a healthy meal, that's a different story. either way, still, when you're babysitting, the kid eats what you make them, noting of course any allergies or diet restrictions. \n\nand even if they wanted you to feed him mcdonalds, they should've told you ahead of time instead of expect you to believe a child who says \"I eat mcdonalds every night for dinner\"", "What lazy parents feed their child McDonald's every night?

This is bizarre. What you get to eat at home and what is provided for you at someone else's is not equal or the same. Eat what you want at home, be grateful for someone else making you dinner when you are out. \n\nParents are a joke. Ask your SIL why she buys an 9 year old Maccy Ds every night.", "Right on.

You made him a nice meal with two veggie sides and I'm assuming he ate it in the end? Doubtless that was the healthiest dinner he'd had in a long time. You don't mention if your nephew cried about it or really put up resistance about it so if he didn't really argue, the McDonald's thing is probably because of his parents not wanting to cook.

Besides, how were you supposed to know that if your SIL didn't tell you beforehand?", "NTA. The fact that eating that much McDonald's is very unhealthy is entirely irrelevant. The important part is that if an elementary school aged child told me they ate McDonald's every. Single. Night. While I was babysitting them, I would automatically assume that child was pulling my leg and trying to get a treat. I would have had exactly the same reaction \"Haha sure thing, buddy, can I help you cut up your chicken?\" That is not something you take a child's word for. I'm sure he would also happily tell you that he has a giant bowl of ice cream for breakfast every day before school and no bedtime ever if he thought it would work.", "The outburst of laughing incredulity and disbelief assaulting the ears of a parent who told me this after babysitting for free would beggar belief.
