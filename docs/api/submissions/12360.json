{"id": 12360, "submission_id": "11rzwda", "title": "AITA for taking my ex-SIL's side over my mom?", "selftext": " Last summer my brother's wife left him. He initially tried to hide the reason why but as it turns out he had been abusing her and she finally left him over his treatment of her oldest son. They have 4 children together (8M/5F/4F/0M) and she has an older son (16M). After finding out the reason for separation my sister and I no longer have a relationship with our brother. \n\nMy dad & brother couldn't care less to have found out that their son/brother was abusing his partner and have been painting his ex the one to blame. My mom is having a hard time. My brother has always been her favorite child and although she has become a lot colder with him she still has a relationship with him. \n\nWhen SIL left my brother, it was the start of the kids summer break and she took them to stay with her dad in a different state. A month later she gave birth to her youngest child. When my mom found out the baby had been born, she was upset that SIL hadn't contacted her as she had been present for her other kids birth. When she tried to contact SIL she wouldn't answer her calls/messages. \n\nIn august, SIL moved back to our city so the kids could return to the same schools. Her and my brother have also sorted out custody/child support and my brother is only allowed a few hours of supervised visitation a week. Since then, my mom has been smothering SIL. It comes from a good place; she feels guilty about what her son did and wants to support SIL. She has been going to all the kids\u2019 events/sports games, taking them out regularly, spoiling them with gifts (I think she spent close to $1000 on the 16 yr olds birthday), and has been inviting herself over to SILs house a lot. \n\nI know SIL is grateful for the help I think she finds my mom's presence a bit much. She recently told my mom (while I was present) that she didn't want to see her until spring break and that afterwards they would sit down and create some boundaries in their relationship and her relationship with the kids. My mom was very upset and called my SIL ungrateful for everything she had done for her and that she would struggle as a single mom without her help. They argued for a while before my mom and I left. In the car my mom tried to get me on her side, but I told her I agreed with SIL and that she had been smothering her and the kids too much and they needed space. \n\nA few days ago, my mom and I got into an argument about it again. My mom tried to defend herself by saying something along the lines of \"it's not my fault \\[brother\\] abused her\" to which I responded that she did hold some blame as she was the one who raised him and arguably helped program his sense of arrogance by favoring him. My mom is now angry at me that I would take SIL's side and overreacting about what I said. Even my sister thinks I'm in the wrong.

SIL is being very reasonable, considering the circumstances. Your mom clearly thinks that she can buy access to the grandkids. Support your SIL however you can, even if just by voicing your support.", "NTA.  Mom's money can't undo years of abuse and her low-key excusing her son's behavior make me totally back former SiL as well.  Mom needs to take a major step back here and consider the fact that she is beyond lucky to have any sort of contact at all given the situation.", "NTA \n\nHowever, it is no ones fault that your ex-SIL was abused. It is only the fault of your brother!! I would say that your mom needs to be prepared for this to be a marathon and not a sprint. Maybe SIL needs some space now, but with 5 kids and a baby, she is going to need help for a very long time.", "NTA. It's very possible for acts of generosity to actually be selfish, and it sounds like this is happening here. If your mother were really concerned with your SIL's well-being, she'd be focused on learning how she overstepped, not on why she shouldn't have been rejected. SIL has a right to set a limit on how much time someone can spend with her and her kids, no matter who that is.", "NTA\n\nI don't know if this will help. I've always lived by speak the truth with love and let the chips fall. I'm old now, people who don't want an honest answer, don't ask what I think.", "NTA to take your SIL's side. It's your SIL's decision, and it should be respected.\n\nBut you did directly blame your mother for bad parenting. You don't do that to someone you care about - not during an argument and not in a situation when the person is already down, and can't change the circumstances anymore. \n\nI would apologize to your mother for hurting her feelings. And try find a right moment to express your opinion of (possibly what she should have done differently as a parent and) how you think she could change her behaviour towards her son to try to modify his behaviour towards women.", "NTA - Everything you've done seems reasonable. I bet Mom is aware of the degree of culpability that she has in this. It might explain the lengths at which she has gone to to support your ex SIL.", "NTA Your mother is reaping all at once things that took a lifetime to sow. I get that she's overwhelmed, but SIL owes her nothing.", "NTA", "ESH, except SIL. Your Mom feels guilty about Brother's behavior and is frankly trying to guilt you into relieving her from that guilt and that's not fair. Sadly, she's sounds manipulative and you fell for her bait and brought more drama to the situation. Take a step back and tell everyone, your not getting involved in working out the new issue between Mom and SIL.", "ESH I was completely with you until you said she raised and programmed him to be an abuser. That's all on him. She was wrong for supporting him afterwards and she's wrong for smothering your SIL but she doesn't have to take the blame for an abusive son. That's where you crossed the line in my opinion. It's just another way of taking some of the blame off him for being an abusive AH.", "NTA.  You were honest with your mom.", "ESH.\n\nIt sounds reasonable to side with the SIL that she could use some space and that your mom was likely being a bit overbearing, but it's really going to far to blame your mother for the abuse her son and your brother did to this woman. Given you still seem to be in regular contact with her, I'd assume she raised you too and it sounds like your sister also. Neither of you seem to be abusive, and I doubt your mother actively told him what to do.\n\nYour mom does need to give your SIL some space, but calling her essentially an abuser to your SIL is really going to far.", "So\u2026 imo no you\u2019re mom is not particularly responsible for what you brother did as abuse. That responsibility is solely with your brother.\n\nSo for that yes you are the AH. However, I think I see what you were going for. You should say to your mom, that while no it\u2019s not her fault what your bro did, it is also not her responsibility to fix his mistakes. That while SIL appreciates the help and love, she also needs space to be a mom herself. \n\nA mom, being a mom to a mom, who is actively a mom creates a hard dynamic. If your (OP\u2019s) mom was more so close by to help when asked for, otherwise standy it would help your SIL a lot. \n\nLove bombing is never great long term", "I have to say YTA. \n\nI was with you until tried to shift blame for your grown brothers actions to your mom.  That is a pretty insulting thing to do.   Then you are saying she is overreacting to it, because it upset her.\n\nMy little brother is an asshole.

They are a new n different family unit that has to figure it out together. I'm sure the SIL is grateful for the help. I know if it was my DIL I'd help her get started out again, I'd likely disown my son for hurting her n the kids too. But I digress.\nI'm thinking MIL is trying to manage their lives and even if MIL truly knew better or did better (cant quite get the wording right on that, sorry) it isn't her place, period.\n\nYou did good.", "NTA. Your Mom needs to realize she doesn't get to force herself into this situation or onto anyone. Depending on where you are a judge could easily say your Mom seeing the kids is to be done on your brothers time and is your brothers responsibility. So it's probably best she plays nice.", "NTA and as soon as you mentioned your mom was upset that your abused SIL gave birth \u201cwithout her\u201d it was pretty clear that your mom holds some messed up views about female autonomy and acceptable male behavior. \n\nYou are a great guy for supporting and respecting your SIL.", "NTA. Sometimes the truth hurts.", "nta the truth hurts sometimes.", "NTA. You truthfully expressed your opinion.", "NTA for taking your SILs side, but I agree with others that you were way out of line pinning your brother's abusive behavior on her favoritism.

Boundaries are fair.\n\nTA for saying ur mom is to blame for ur ADULT brother being an AH.   \nBy blaming ur mom for what happened, ur just like ur dad and brothers, justifying ur brothers behaviour as not 100% his fault.   \nWhich is weird.   \nBecause u cut off ties with ur bro and not ur mom.   \nIf u really felt like ur mom was partially responsible, i think u wouldve cut her off too.    \nOpinion: it sounds like u weaponized ur sil's abuse just to hurt ur mom because u saw a chance to bring up ur own grievances with her parenting, even tho u know she isnt responsible. Which is an AH move.\n\nEDIT\nForgot to add that part of the reason I think this way is because:   \nDad seems to be in support of the brothers behaviour.   \nMom is actively working against it the behaviour.   \n\nIt seems weird to me to blame the mom instead of the dad for the brothers behaviour, unless they have some sort of personal motive.", "ESH. Your mom for smothering your ex SIL and you for blaming her for your brothers actions. He chose to abuse his wife and kids.", "It's concerning that your dad and brother could care less that your brother is abusive. He was also abusive to a child. So if one of your SOs hurt you, your dad would be alright with that? Your brother learned that shit somewhere. Even if jokingly,  like a woman's place, give her slap, etc... that's not okay. And if your mother laughed or didn't lock that shit down, then she IS culpable. Golden boy has anger issues.

Parents certainly influence their children but to place all the bad actions of a child on the parent is nonsense, especially when that child is now an adult with four kids of their own, and especially when that parent has other supposedly well adjusted children.  \n\n\nThe whole favoritism thing needs taken with a pinch of salt to begin with as siblings always argue over such things. Not saying it's not true, but it's far from sufficient to support a claim that the mother somehow caused her son to become abusive to his wife.", "You don\u2019t have consequences for your actions makes you think you can do whatever you want. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f doesn\u2019t directly make you an abuser just makes you an entitled prick that can morph into abuse for some people", "This. Plus how the dad reacted vs the mom.

It might help to remind your mom that they are getting divorced and the kids need to get used to a new normal.  That takes time by themselves.
