He initially tried to hide the reason why but as it turns out he had been abusing her and she finally left him over his treatment of her oldest son. They have 4 children together (8M/5F/4F/0M) and she has an older son (16M). After finding out the reason for separation my sister and I no longer have a relationship with our brother. \n\nMy dad & brother couldn't care less to have found out that their son/brother was abusing his partner and have been painting his ex the one to blame. My mom is having a hard time. My brother has always been her favorite child and although she has become a lot colder with him she still has a relationship with him. \n\nWhen SIL left my brother, it was the start of the kids summer break and she took them to stay with her dad in a different state. A month later she gave birth to her youngest child. When my mom found out the baby had been born, she was upset that SIL hadn't contacted her as she had been present for her other kids birth. When she tried to contact SIL she wouldn't answer her calls/messages. \n\nIn august, SIL moved back to our city so the kids could return to the same schools. Her and my brother have also sorted out custody/child support and my brother is only allowed a few hours of supervised visitation a week. Since then, my mom has been smothering SIL. It comes from a good place; she feels guilty about what her son did and wants to support SIL. She has been going to all the kids\u2019 events/sports games, taking them out regularly, spoiling them with gifts (I think she spent close to $1000 on the 16 yr olds birthday), and has been inviting herself over to SILs house a lot. \n\nI know SIL is grateful for the help I think she finds my mom's presence a bit much. She recently told my mom (while I was present) that she didn't want to see her until spring break and that afterwards they would sit down and create some boundaries in their relationship and her relationship with the kids. My mom was very upset and called my SIL ungrateful for everything she had done for her and that she would struggle as a single mom without her help. They argued for a while before my mom and I left. In the car my mom tried to get me on her side, but I told her I agreed with SIL and that she had been smothering her and the kids too much and they needed space. \n\nA few days ago, my mom and I got into an argument about it again. My mom tried to defend herself by saying something along the lines of \"it's not my fault \\[brother\\] abused her\" to which I responded that she did hold some blame as she was the one who raised him and arguably helped program his sense of arrogance by favoring him. My mom is now angry at me that I would take SIL's side and overreacting about what I said. Even my sister thinks I'm in the wrong.

Your Mom feels guilty about Brother's behavior and is frankly trying to guilt you into relieving her from that guilt and that's not fair.

That's all on him. She was wrong for supporting him afterwards and she's wrong for smothering your SIL but she doesn't have to take the blame for an abusive son.

You were honest with your mom.", "ESH.\n\nIt sounds reasonable to side with the SIL that she could use some space and that your mom was likely being a bit overbearing, but it's really going to far to blame your mother for the abuse her son and your brother did to this woman. Given you still seem to be in regular contact with her, I'd assume she raised you too and it sounds like your sister also. Neither of you seem to be abusive, and I doubt your mother actively told him what to do.\n\nYour mom does need to give your SIL some space, but calling her essentially an abuser to your SIL is really going to far.", "So\u2026 imo no you\u2019re mom is not particularly responsible for what you brother did as abuse.

You should say to your mom, that while no it\u2019s not her fault what your bro did, it is also not her responsibility to fix his mistakes. That while SIL appreciates the help and love, she also needs space to be a mom herself. \n\nA mom, being a mom to a mom, who is actively a mom creates a hard dynamic.

Just because she's your mother doesn't mean you automatically side with her, especially when she's obviously in the wrong.", "My question is she the mole for the abusive son, getting dirt on the ex, giving messages to the kids, working on getting the kids to take her son's side.", "Just what I was thinking.  Other things happen as well. She can be working to make the ex look bad as a parent.  Trying to win her son better visitation.", "ESH except the SIL\nSiding with the SIL is the right call imo, but you lost me at telling your mom that your brother being abusive is her fault. Pretty messed up thing to lay on someone, and not exactly a healthy thing to say to someone who seems to genuinely want to do right by her grandkids.", "You are NTA for supporting your ex-SIL's intention to build boundaries with your mom.\n\nYour mom is wrong for not understanding SIL and kids' need for space. This situation your brother created is not a good or easy one, and your mom struggles to deal with difficult things.\n\nShe may have some role in your brother's abusive behavior, but his behavior is all is to own.\n\nI think you helping your mom understand that SIL and the kids need some space, that your mom would help best if she let SIL tell her what help she needs and is comfortable with... and respected the boundaries SIL feels she needs to uphold.\n\nIt's probably not your place to judge whether/how much your mom helped your brother become the abuse he is; and it's probably more than your mom is ready to consider or process. I suggest you step back from that comment and focus more on helping your mom better accept what your SIL needs and wants.", "I think mom needs to have a sit down conversation without blame being thrown around (unless it's at the abusive ahole brother), about the reality of what SIL and her son went through, and that her love bombing them isn't going to make up for that.  Boundaries aren't a bad thing, and if she insists on behaving this way, that's only going to make SIL pull even further away from the family.  They need to feel safe and respected right now, and to feel like grandma isn't going to just be a proxy for her son.", "YTA only because it was nothing to do with your mum that the brother abused his wife. To say that to your own mum shows problems with you and you are an absolute asshole for saying it. You\u2019re the sister to the guy, why didn\u2019t you stop it. You\u2019re closer in age to him, he grew up as a sibling to you and that would have affected the way he grew up and why so maybe you\u2019re to blame more than the mum? See how stupid that is. Exactly. YTA your mum deserves better than you.", "NTA. As a person who grew up with a GC sibling, I think the childhood favouritism definitely contributes to a persons sense of entitlement and lack of respect or empathy for others", "NTA \n\nI probably would have snapped at mom too.\n\nDad's behaviour makes me wonder if that is where bad-brother learned it from.\n\nJust because they are biologically related doesn't mean they can't be called.out on their BS.", "NTA for siding with SIL but YTA for blaming your mom for him being an abuser.", "It is not your mom's fault. Plenty of boys are spoiled and favored, and they don't abuse anyone. So, on that YTA. However, your mom saying \" it's not my fault\" as if that gives her the right to control how SIL deals with it or that SIL can't set boundaries bc it's not her adult just simply doesn't make sense. So, mom is also the AH. I'm sure SIL is grateful and simply needs to make some kind of progress as far as organizing her new reality. Making this about you and your mom is pathetic and just really awful. The both of you are in need of some serious compassion and empsthy.", ">I know SIL is grateful for the help I think she finds my mom's presence a bit much. She recently told my mom (while I was present) that she didn't want to see her until spring break and that afterwards they would sit down and create some boundaries in their relationship and her relationship with the kids. My mom was very upset and called my SIL ungrateful for everything she had done for her and that she would struggle as a single mom without her help. They argued for a while before my mom and I left. In the car my mom tried to get me on her side, but I told her I agreed with SIL and that she had been smothering her and the kids too much and they needed space.\n\nIt sounds like your mom had a little \"I'm trying to be *me* for *you*!\" meltdown moment being confronted by both you and SIL.\n\n>My mom tried to defend herself by saying something along the lines of \"it's not my fault \\[brother\\] abused her\" to which I responded that she did hold some blame as she was the one who raised him and arguably helped program his sense of arrogance by favoring him. \n\nI have a feeling that your mom's intrusive/clingy behavior might be compelled by an already overwhelming feeling of guilt/compunction/responsibility just from what you quoted of her here. You mentioned earlier that your mom really favored your brother. You probably already know this, but a lot of parents (especially older women from more traditional/conservative backgrounds who haven't had the opportunities/regard/etc. to make more of themselves than what they put into their children) identify closely with their children's accomplishments and consider their children extensions/reflections of themselves, at times to the point of considering an adult child not a friend/peer but a second/surrogate life (of their own!) With your adult brother being \"revealed\" to her in such a shocking and cruel light, a sense of personal loss along with that duty or guilt towards her DIL is motivating your mother to cling to your SIL. \n\nIn general, it seems like you're describing a pattern of utterly uninvolved men and overly-involved women. Consider the fact that everyone's emotions are being described (and thus, likely, felt/expressed by everyone) *but* the men involved. Consider how your sister is directing her wrath at you for something she was not even directly involved in. This is an extremely unilaterally turbulent situation. It sounds like you've been listening and wisely deferring to your SIL. Continue to support her/kids in ways she asks for and see if there are any public programs for assistance available for her while you/her take a break from Hurt Mom.\n\nNTA.", "Additionally. I personally think that an abusive husband and boundary crossing MIL have the same energy, and deep down, the same social skills issues. Inability to empathize comes from somewhere.", "Nailed it!", "Na, thats fine to say. I mean the mom is boundary stomping with the SIL in her own right. Not hard to believe she never taught her son boundaries. And that very well could have played a big part in him becoming abusive. That his dad and brother don't care about the abuse is very telling too."]}
