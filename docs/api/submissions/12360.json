He initially tried to hide the reason why but as it turns out he had been abusing her and she finally left him over his treatment of her oldest son. They have 4 children together (8M/5F/4F/0M) and she has an older son (16M). After finding out the reason for separation my sister and I no longer have a relationship with our brother. \n\nMy dad & brother couldn't care less to have found out that their son/brother was abusing his partner and have been painting his ex the one to blame. My mom is having a hard time. My brother has always been her favorite child and although she has become a lot colder with him she still has a relationship with him. \n\nWhen SIL left my brother, it was the start of the kids summer break and she took them to stay with her dad in a different state. A month later she gave birth to her youngest child. When my mom found out the baby had been born, she was upset that SIL hadn't contacted her as she had been present for her other kids birth. When she tried to contact SIL she wouldn't answer her calls/messages. \n\nIn august, SIL moved back to our city so the kids could return to the same schools. Her and my brother have also sorted out custody/child support and my brother is only allowed a few hours of supervised visitation a week. Since then, my mom has been smothering SIL. It comes from a good place; she feels guilty about what her son did and wants to support SIL. She has been going to all the kids\u2019 events/sports games, taking them out regularly, spoiling them with gifts (I think she spent close to $1000 on the 16 yr olds birthday), and has been inviting herself over to SILs house a lot. \n\nI know SIL is grateful for the help I think she finds my mom's presence a bit much. She recently told my mom (while I was present) that she didn't want to see her until spring break and that afterwards they would sit down and create some boundaries in their relationship and her relationship with the kids. My mom was very upset and called my SIL ungrateful for everything she had done for her and that she would struggle as a single mom without her help. They argued for a while before my mom and I left. In the car my mom tried to get me on her side, but I told her I agreed with SIL and that she had been smothering her and the kids too much and they needed space. \n\nA few days ago, my mom and I got into an argument about it again. My mom tried to defend herself by saying something along the lines of \"it's not my fault \\[brother\\] abused her\" to which I responded that she did hold some blame as she was the one who raised him and arguably helped program his sense of arrogance by favoring him. My mom is now angry at me that I would take SIL's side and overreacting about what I said. Even my sister thinks I'm in the wrong.

I get that she's overwhelmed, but SIL owes her nothing.", "NTA", "ESH, except SIL. Your Mom feels guilty about Brother's behavior and is frankly trying to guilt you into relieving her from that guilt and that's not fair.

That's all on him. She was wrong for supporting him afterwards and she's wrong for smothering your SIL but she doesn't have to take the blame for an abusive son.

You were honest with your mom.", "ESH.\n\nIt sounds reasonable to side with the SIL that she could use some space and that your mom was likely being a bit overbearing, but it's really going to far to blame your mother for the abuse her son and your brother did to this woman. Given you still seem to be in regular contact with her, I'd assume she raised you too and it sounds like your sister also. Neither of you seem to be abusive, and I doubt your mother actively told him what to do.\n\nYour mom does need to give your SIL some space, but calling her essentially an abuser to your SIL is really going to far.", "So\u2026 imo no you\u2019re mom is not particularly responsible for what you brother did as abuse.

You should say to your mom, that while no it\u2019s not her fault what your bro did, it is also not her responsibility to fix his mistakes. That while SIL appreciates the help and love, she also needs space to be a mom herself. \n\nA mom, being a mom to a mom, who is actively a mom creates a hard dynamic.

Boundaries are fair.\n\nTA for saying ur mom is to blame for ur ADULT brother being an AH.   \nBy blaming ur mom for what happened, ur just like ur dad and brothers, justifying ur brothers behaviour as not 100% his fault.   \nWhich is weird.   \nBecause u cut off ties with ur bro and not ur mom.   \nIf u really felt like ur mom was partially responsible, i think u wouldve cut her off too.    \nOpinion: it sounds like u weaponized ur sil's abuse just to hurt ur mom because u saw a chance to bring up ur own grievances with her parenting, even tho u know she isnt responsible. Which is an AH move.\n\nEDIT\nForgot to add that part of the reason I think this way is because:   \nDad seems to be in support of the brothers behaviour.   \nMom is actively working against it the behaviour.   \n\nIt seems weird to me to blame the mom instead of the dad for the brothers behaviour, unless they have some sort of personal motive.", "ESH.

That to me screams of the parents raising those boys to think that this kind of behavior is acceptable.  It's every abuser a product of a bad home?

Your family created an abusive man and most have shown no issues with that, when confronted with the truth about him. They turned their backs on SIL, and now that your mother is forcing herself on her, trying to buy her way out of her failures.

Wonder where your brother got it from?", "NTA, but if I was mom I would stop trying to spend time with SIL and kids all together unless they called me.

And there is most likely some truth to the conclusion you made about his being her golden child did probably help build his sense of arrogance. Does the statement you made about your father and other brother didn't care that he was abusive mean that they are possibly abusive as well? Could your mother have been on the receiving end and didn't want to see it in his character and is feeling guilty and that is why she is overdoing it with ex-SIL?

I do think the fact OP said this is her mum\u2019s fault is telling, though, of their upbringing.", "Well the mother may not be at fault for her son abusing her ex-daughter-in-law, she is at fault for continuing to have a relationship with her abusive son, despite knowing what happened, and then trying to manipulate and weaponize that as an excuse to continue seeing the kids whenever she wants and disregarding the children's mother's decision.", "Yeah I have a feeling if Father is victim blaming that brother probably learned those behaviors from the father. Perhaps even from watching the father abuse the mother. At the very least, father probably passed on some toxic misogynist ideas to his sons", "There are people who grow up with abusers (I'm assuming the father was either an abuser or verbally misogynist) and come to denounce abuse and there are people who model the abuse later in life. Though I think father's and brother's reaction is more telling where the behavior stems from than only the mother treating him as golden child. That might be OP's own resentment"]}
