I work in health care and have to work on holidays occasionally, this was my holiday to work 3pm to 11pm. We set that dinner was going to be at 2pm so I had time to eat quick and then run to work. Well of course no one was there on time (we even got there early)so they did not start dinner until after I was already in work. I asked my husband if he would bring me up a plate of dinner afterwards, he said yes. He ended up bringing up to me about a tablespoons worth of 3 different things and said this was all that was left. I then asked him if anyone got leftovers to take home and he said oh yeah every family got 2 takeout containers to go home with and this was what was leftover after that. All of the people at the dinner knew that I 1. Did not eat anything. And 2. Knew that I went into work. But never thought that it was a good idea to make sure that the 1 person who made most of the dinner was fed. AITA for getting into an argument with my husband for not making sure there was something for me to eat?

I could get behind a potluck, but if I'm cooking 90% of the meal you can drag your happy asses to my home.", "NTA\n\nDo not cook next year. Ideally your husband should handle talking to his family, but I sincerely doubt he has that wherewithal, given that he literally gave away your food. \n\nSo... \n\n\"Last year hubby and I put a lot of effort into making a successful Thanksgiving dinner for the family. Yet, not one person bothered to make sure that I actually got to eat. Beyond being hungry, I was hurt. It is someone else's turn to put in the work this year, I'm taking the year off from cooking. I look forward to seeing you all there.\" \n\nAnd then do not engage. Let the ah's figure it out themselves.", "NTA  \n\n\nBut your entire IL family is! Every single adult involved in that event is an ah besides you. First off.... It's a real mf to have to work certain holidays... Thanksgiving and Christmas are the main two that suck shit. I would know, I've been doing it for nearly 20 years now. In fact, I was working right along with you this year. \n\nThe fact that they (including your husband) had the balls to drop off a plate with so little food on it is absolutely insane. Especially given the fact that they all took giant helpings of leftovers home. I'm especially pissed that your own husband was crazy enough to walk into your work with that bullshit. \n\nIf I were you, I'd never cook for one of them again. Not even your husband. Not until they realize that you don't fuck over the person that cooked a majority of your meal and then went to work.", "NYTA\n\nYour husband is the biggest culprit\r  \nIt is YOUR OBLIGATION as a couple to make sure you have food.\r  \n\r  \nI better not even mention all the rude things that go through my head.", "Well that was actually down to your husband to say woah stop, my wife gets first dibs on the leftovers .  He was an idiot , they were all thoughtless and greedy. \n\nYou know what not to do next year.", "NTA. It's absolutely shameful that your husband or any of the family there thought to set aside a full plate of food for you. You have *every* right to be upset and hurt. Next year, just don't cook. Or take food for yourself even if everyone else is late and you have to go. You cooked it, you should be able to eat it.", "NTA\n\nTell them to get stuffed about Christmas or any other holidays, you're not cooking for anyone but your household going forward.  And if your jerk husband ever realizes what an asshole he's been and truly apologizes to you, well maybe he can have some too.", "NTA and I honestly can't believe you married into a family that is so incredibly thoughtless. You had to have known this beforehand right? This can't be the first time they've been complete assholes to you, your husband included.\n\nFrankly, I'm surprised that, when they hadn't bothered to start serving by 2:30 that you didn't just serve yourself a huge portion of everything and leave for work. Heck, at that point I would have taken enough to feed my coworkers as well.", "NTA\n\nNext year withdraw your labour!\n\nI would really like to hear what your husband had to say for himself and why he didn't make sure you got a full meal after doing all the work. He is the biggest AH of the lot\n\nit seems to be a recurring theme on here at the moment, greedy in-laws snaffling all the leftovers away.\n\nBut in all seriousness, don't do any food apart from 1 plate next year.", "Definitely NTA. But your husband is, along with everyone else that was there!. Now that the family has shown you what they REALLY think of you, it would be in your best interest to NOT ever again attend, or much less cook for, dinners with the cretins!", "I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t just grab a plate and eat at the scheduled time before you left to go to work. If they were all late, that\u2019s on them. What makes their time more valuable than yours? If they kick up a stink because the person that made the effort to make the food actually ate the food, that\u2019s a whole new level of crazy.", "NTA. They seem to be uncaring trolls.

Also NTA if you decide to never cook for him or them again. \n\nYou might be the A for being pissed at his family. It was his responsibility to get you food, you asked him to do it, not them. He could have stepped in at any time to remind everyone that you still needed some food, but he didn't. He also didn't bring you a dinner even if he messed up and forgot to say something, he could have picked you up something else to eat. Instead, he left you hungry.", "NTA. Stop doing this and let others people pick up the slack.", "NTA why are there so many entitled and selfish people in this world!! My gawd!!! Next year book two days off n get yourself to a spa hotel with all your own trimmings!!", "NTA\u2026that would be the last dinner I cooked and took it somewhere else and the one you really should be mad at is your husband.  Why isn\u2019t he in the dog house?  Why didn\u2019t he make you a plate first before everyone else?   You did most if the cooking and because back and let\u2019s everyone take leftovers before you get anything?!", "NTA \n\nThey are all assholes, especially husband.

When a fried or family is missing due to work etc, making them a plate is just just thoughtful, telling them we missed you here, and gives them a nice lil taste of everything to look forward to.", "The family prob just gave hubby too much credit. They prob heard her ask him to make a plate and so assumed he was not such a nitwit he was incapable of performing this basic task and that he\u2019d done it so they were free to pack up the leftovers", "Yeah like he doesn't make her a plate so she can have some of the feast she made?  It's common practice for most people I know that when someone has to leave early etc (even if they're not the one cooking most of it like OP was) you make them a plate with a bit of everything and put it aside.", "Or leave him without eating and give away all the leftovers in the refrigerator to see if he likes to stay hungry.", "lol, OP could spend the entire day cooking and then surprise her husband by taking it all to work to share with her coworkers. haha!!!", "That's a very good idea"]}
