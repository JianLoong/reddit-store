He ended up bringing up to me about a tablespoons worth of 3 different things and said this was all that was left.

When they realized things were running late, a plate should have been made for OP before anyone else ate and before they left for work!! \nHubs also should have picked up wife\u2019s favorite dessert or candy bar or soda as a surprise at the minimum when showing up \n(Considering she did prep for a holiday she couldn\u2019t even attend and is working a holiday)", "That is what I was thinking too, maybe it wasn\u00b4t the whole family intentionally leaving her out.\n\nI would have assumed that her husband would not have been such an incompetent moron, and he would obviously have made her a nice plate of food for later. That is literally what he said he would do! \n\nThat said, the family is not completely off the hook because not one of them ASKED, hey where\u00b4s OP\u00b4s plate, when they were loading up their tupperwares with the food she cooked and delivered to them! It doesn\u00b4t even sound like anyone said Thank You to OP. Plus OP and husband didn\u00b4t get leftovers, why does everybody get boxes of leftovers except the cook?\n\nHusband definitely the biggest ASS.HOOOOOOOLLLLLEEEE and family also assholes, but milder", "What really got me was two things.\n\n1.) He KNEW she hadn't eaten because people dicked around and caused dinner to start later than expected.\n\n2.) He stood by while all the leftovers were packaged up by HIS family and proceeds to bring the literal scraps to her.\n\nDickishness all around.", ">  **Send it NOW**.\n\nAbsolutely.  Christmas is coming - make sure that they never have another chance to pull this on you again, OP.  Your ire is justified.\n\nNTA", "Update: he has not apologized, nor does he think that he did any wrong. I was not there, so I do not know if anyone there said anything about me not getting anything. Needless to say, we are not on speaking terms right now and not so sure if we are going to be.", "If you ever cook for them again, take a big piece of everything out before delivering it. I mean it. Every pie should have 1/4 missing. Take a leg and half a breast off the turkey. Etc. \n\nTell them , yeah, remember last year when I did all the work and not one of you thought to make me a plate? That so not happening again. \n\nNTA they are all AH especially your husband and the host.", "NTA.  And in future do not cater anything towards the dinner.  The rest of the family can step up instead of freeloading.  Your husband definitely stuffed up on this one.  Also the set dinner start time is the start time so if people are late then tough.", "NTA. Everybody should have thought of you, and your husband most of all.", "NTA, I work in healthcare. I worked Thanksgiving overnight (10pm to 8:30am). I unfortunately had to sleep through dinner to be awake for my last overnight shift. (My mom cooked and there were leftovers to eat too, but this is about an SO specifically). My boyfriend of 8 months had the day off. We don't live together. He and his mother packaged up a heaping to go plate that he brought to me before I left for work, without my asking. We are in our mid to late 20s. No excuse your husband and his family wouldn't save you a plate before everyone else took it all.", "Absolutely NTA! The lack of respect and/or consideration you were shown is indefensible. I'm definitely not one to sow turmoil in anyone's relationship, but your husband deserves to have his hide nailed to the wall, and I'M A MAN. This just goes beyond your average forgetfulness. I can't tell you how I'd handle this, but at a minimum, your husband must be held accountable. For some reason, this really struck a nerve with me!", "How the hell did you get roped into this setup?  Tell your sister in law that hosting means cooking.  And make sure to thank the rest of those deadbeats at Christmas for saving you some of the food THAT YOU COOKED.\n\nI honestly wonder about some of you people.  I would tell them all to get fucked and go out to dinner.  Plenty of restaurants in my area make a full Thanksgiving dinner, and send you home with the leftovers.", "NTA. I had to work one thanksgiving and asked my husband to make me a plate so I would have something to eat when I arrived after work and he did not and said everybody ate everything. There was only a couple slices of pie left and I hadn\u2019t eaten all day because of how busy I was at work. I was furious and left.", "all AH except you.  I would tell them now that next year this shit isn't going to fly", "NTA and do not provide their stingy self centered asses any food next year they can figure it out or you leave with EVERYTHING.", "NTA - you absolutely deserve your anger. DO NOT COOK FOR THEM EVER AGAIN. They didn't give a crap about you - why should you slave for them? What a-holes!", "NTA that\u2019s awful of them all but especially of your husband", "NTA. I guess this is the last year you need to cook! A family at least respects each other! \nBut I\u2019d say your BIGGEST problem is your HUSBAND! You left him in charge. You asked him to bring you food. His JOB was to take care of setting YOUR FOOD aside Before he ate his dinner. Your husband is the AH. And your SIL\u2019s family has ZERO respect for you in general and absolutely NO Appreciation of the effort you make. It\u2019s Thanksgiving for heaven\u2019s sake and they certainly have made it crystal clear, they aren\u2019t thankful for you! If I had to go back, next time I\u2019d bring purchased pizzas.", "ESH. Since most of the dinner was already there (provided by you and your husband), you could have eaten before work or made a plate to take with you to work. Your husband is an AH for agreeing to bring you a plate later and then waiting until everything was gone to fix the plate and for not saying anything to his family for taking everything knowing you had not eaten.", "Nta but your husband is. It is his responsibility to make sure you have a generous plate of food saved. Shame on him. What a bunch of jerks!!!", "NTA. I'd stop cooking for all of them.", "NTA, he should have fixed you a to go plate before serving everyone else.", "NTA. They are all AH.", "NTA. I would just refuse to cook again", "I hope you make your husband and SIL read this thread.", "NTA at all! What is wrong with your husband that he didn't make sure you got a full plate of everything?! especially if you cooked it! \n\nI wonder if your family assumed husband had put food aside for you before packing up their leftovers. Honestly, he has some major explaining to do and I don't think you should cook next year and tell everyone it's because no one saved you a plate this year. I'm so sorry!", "Yeah your husband hosed you.  Not on anyone but him to make you a plate and bring it to you.", "NTA.  I applaud your manners but you really should have eaten something before you went to work.  Even though some family members were late.  If they were late, what's the old saying?  \"Snooze you lose.\"  My oldest brother and his wife were always late for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. One year on Thanksgiving they were supposed to bring the turkey.  Dinner was at 1:00.  At 1:30 i told my wife i like my dinner hot, so i fixed myself a plate.  So did most everyone else.  They arrived at 2:30 and were pissed that we had already started without them.   I used to Quail hunt and my wife had baked a big pan of Quail breasts under the stuffing.  So we made due without the turkey.  So a month later for Christmas,dinner would be at 1:00 PM.  Guess who was late?  Guess who started dinner without them?  Yes, me.  They walked out and drove off.  Snooze you lose.", "Your husband is the AH.  You can bet if the roles were reversed OP would have remembered to put together a plate for him- weaponized incompetence.  Don\u2019t accept his lame excuses and wide eyed innocence.  NTA", "NTA.  I secretly want posts like yours to be fake because I cannot fathom people\u2019s lack of awareness and/or selfishness.  He should be ashamed of himself.", "NTA.  That was outrageously inconsiderate of your husband and his family.  Next year, absolutely do not make dinner.  If your husband wants to do a bunch of cooking, let him.  I would spend the morning at the spa.", "This was posted somewhere else with a different username\nPeople said it wasn\u2019t a real post", "NTA. That\u2019s extremely inconsiderate of him and his family. Seriously- I\u2019m choked than anyone would treat someone like that.\nWhat an egotistical bunch! I wouldn\u2019t cook for them again.", "Your husband should have made sure there was something for you. Were you so far from his mind that he didnt even think of you? And the rest of the family? What greedy selfish assholes! I would be fuming! \n\nIf I were you, OP, this would be the last time I did anything for these entitled jerks.  And husband would be on very thin ice too.\n\nYou are so NTA. Maybe put something on social media on how much you enjoyed your tablespoon of Thanksgiving dinner, that you mostly cooked, but had to work, so couldn't attend. Also ask did everyone enjoy the piles of leftovers they took home, but no one thought to save you some? Call out their selfish asses!", "NTA. Wow. This is just awful. And you're the second lady who has posted having to work and not getting food while people took leftovers home. (The other one also cooked). I would never cook for them again.", "Hindsight is 20/20\n\nBOX YOUR FOOD BEFORE THEY EAT\n\nAsk your husband why you were only given a small plate of food? That\u2019s an AH move and borderline divorce", "NTA, and this would be the last Thanksgiving that I would cook if I were you. Atrocious behavior on their part and nobody even thought about you. You now see where you fit and how you are valued by them, including your husband.", "NTA. I would tell him that you will never cook for thanksgiving again. Honestly, the fact that he didnt bring you a real plate of food is a big red flag showing how much he really cares for you.", "NTA, you have every right to be furious at your husband for not making YOU a plate and leftovers before everyone else took their share.\n\nAnd at the family as a whole for being so ungrateful.\n\nI think it's very clear that next year you do not cook for these people.", "NTA. Your husband is descended from jackasses. My honest opinion is that he's one too. If I were you that would be the last cooking I did for that family, unless they come at you with abject apologies issued without equivocation or excuse, just an unadulterated admission that what they did was wrong and that it will not happen again.  Otherwise, from here on out you're the person who brings the rolls. Store bought rolls. I'm sorry this happened to you.  I would be livid.\nEdited to add: and same apology from husband.", "NTA. Your spouse is the one to blame here. Everyone else is a close second. Just don\u2019t cook next year. See how much food is going home with them then. \n\nI don\u2019t understand all these stories of people just scooping up so much of the leftovers. Friendsgiving, Thanksgiving, just regular potlucks are basically a game of \u201cNOT IT\u201d for the majority of the food. If we really like something it is discussed and no one has ever gone without if absent. The audacity of some people\u2019s children.", "NTA What I would do is pretend that I was going to cook an entire meal for them so they'd come over for the next family get together holiday. Then when they show up come out with a single plate of food and sit eating it in front of them. \"I cooked last time and you left me nothing. I cooked this time and you get to watch me enjoy it while getting nothing.\"", "I can damn sure guarantee I\u2019d never cook another thing for those jerks again.", "Welp, now you know to never prepare thanksgiving meal again if you can\u2019t stay for the entire time.  You should send a group text to all of them asking how the meal was and then point out that you wouldn\u2019t know because NO ONE was thoughtful enough to make you a carry out container.   you know, for all the food I prepared.   Love you too!", "NTA\n\nYour husband is the biggest AH. It was his job to make sure food was put aside for you.", "NTA. I always keep a box at home when I cook large amounts. Bc I made that good stuff. Treat yo self. Also I\u2019m beyond pissed for you. Sorry girl.", "NTA\n\nNext year I'd literally make a meal for one and enjoy it by myself and keep all the leftovers for myself", "You really shouldn\u2019t cook for them at all next year. \nUnbelievably thoughtless and selfish. NTA", "I would happily cook everything and bring to someone else\u2019s house to not have to cook and host. But if this was my family, my MIL would have made sure I had a huge plate put aside before anyone else got any food. It\u2019s insane that the husband and MIL did not do that for OP. \n\nOP NTA. I hope this isn\u2019t normal behavior for your husband to not be so careless", "Agree that husband is for sure the AH, we don't have enough info to know whether the rest of the family are AHs or not. Hubs was the one who promised OP he'd make up a plate for her, and he dropped the ball.", "For real. Her husband clearly forgot to make her a plate and then remembered after everyone had left (with the leftovers) and scraped out what was left in the pans to bring her home.", "I would send them a note. Dear family,  I am glad to hear you enjoyed my cooking so much that you took every scrap of leftover home. Since it didn't occur to any of you that me, the cook, hadn't eaten any of it, due to your tardiness, and would have liked to have some leftovers myself,  instead of cooking the next day again, keep this meal as a fond memory. It was the last I cooked for all of you. I look very much forward to Christmas,  Easter, and all the family gatherings to come, when I will enjoy the delicious dinners you cook. And should I have to work, don't worry.  I will make sure that my dear husband bring enough containers to take home a full meal for me and leftovers for at least two days.", "She was already at work by the time the food was ready.", "Refuse to cook for them ever again.", "Update above", "I can say that this one is real. Because I was the one that ended up at Sheetz getting something to eat after my shift!", ">You only get to take home the leftovers of the food you brought, unless explicitly told otherwise by the maker\n\nThough it's rare I'd cooking for my friends and not send them home with something.\n\nThanksgiving, we usually pass around the tupperware and fill them all, factory line style. We even tell people to bring their own so we don't have to get it back.", "You cooked it, you should be able to eat it.", "We have a smaller family, but I get meal prep containers and make leftover meals for each person with equal amounts of everything. It's a nice thing to throw in the microwave for a quick meal later.\n\nWe do a little alterations to the to go bags of someone who doesn't want their cookies or rolls.\n\nAnd then my sister and I always wash the dishes quick of the guests' things, so they go home with no clean up! \n\nHusband's family here was just being not thoughtful at all. And OPs husband was just slacking, should have spoken up for his wife. This weekend would be a good weekend for him to make her a 'do over' meal, he can recruit his family to donate dishes.", "there was another post recently where a woman gave up doing ALL the work and took herself on vacation.  this post gave me those exact vibes.", "This only works when the family is considerate. \n\nMy family the people who didn't come get plates set up to be taken home first and then left overs get grabbed by those who want them and what's left the maker takes home. It's a lot more simple than it probably sounds but it works for us because we're all nice and looking out for each other. \n\nSadly, OP's in-laws weren't looking out for her.", "Yes the lady who went to the beach!", "This works almost all the time for us.\n\nWe live across the country from our families. So it's always with friends. You know. People you chose to have around.\n\nPeople act like OP's family won't have a spot at my table.", "I think she ended up staying by the pool but is separating from her husband (and his mooching family).", "We do Friendsgiving as well so I completely understand that."]}
