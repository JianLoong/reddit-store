I don\u2019t blame your wife for having strong feelings about having them meet, bcs it sounds as though you don\u2019t quite realise how abusive his behaviour was. \nSaying that, having an open discussion with your daughter who is 15, and respecting her decision is good parenting. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t take after your dad", "INFO: I do not understand why Maisy shouldn't meet your dad.  You didn't like him as a parent, but he wouldn't be Maisy's parent.

You've claimed that your Father wasn't abusive but some of the examples you've given in the comments do imply a slightly different story.

Glad she was raised right and can recognize signs that your clearly ignoring because \u201cyou turned out fine lol\u201d. I do understand your wife\u2019s apprehensions since your dad was an ABUSIVE person, she\u2019s probably exaggerating a bit due to her not being close by and only allowing emergency contact. I\u2019m imagining military or some high paying job that\u2019s very stressful.", "Because she's still a child and I suspect op is severely sugar coating how badly the grandfather behaved.  It could be endangering her.", "He was never violent, or I wouldn't even consider letting him near my kid! He just had weird ideas, like locking me in the closet overnight to help me get over my fear of the dark, or letting me smoke and drink with him starting when I was around 10. He was very much a 'throw the kid in the water to teach them how to swim' type. It was a different time lol", "My wife knows the stuff I've told her from her childhood, and even though I wouldn't treat Maisy the same, my wife might be worried I would? Or that my dad would act like he did towards me? I just know that on the rare occasion my dad comes up in convo, my wife is very clear that she doesn't like him despite having never met him", "I wouldn't call him abusive, but I can understand that I maybe should have waited to talk to my wife since I know she doesn't like my dad", "And daughter said no....", "I'd personally rather be beat than locked in a closet. That sounds like torture.", "Hitting isn't the only form of abuse. The things you mention him doing are just as bad. You say it must have worked because you barely remember it, but not remembering or not having feelings about it can be a trauma response, and in any case it's not proof of it doing any good.\n\nI'm not sure this is a case of anyone being TA at all. But I do get where your wife is coming from with her (maybe over)protectiveness when you're kind of glib about him doing terrible things. She might be worried about whether you've got a realistic sense of what behavior toward Maisy would be okay for him to do when this is how you talk about the abuse he put you through.", "NTA, I guess.  I'm not hearing any reason they can't *meet*.", "While it probably sucked at the time, it's long enough ago that I barely remember more than that it happened, so it must've worked lol. Just like the time when I lost my house key so my dad wouldn't let me inside until after dinner, and I never lost another key after that. So you could say that his parenting worked, even if I would never do the same for my daughter.", "You said he wasn't abusive. But locking a child in a dark closet to get over a fear IS abuse.", "Dude, you WERE abused. You were abused and scared by your dad your whole childhood.", "NTA. Maisy is old enough to have a say, and it's JUST a meeting and conversation - you aren't handing her over.  Your wife is an Absent Parent (due to work) and you are a fully functioning Adult, so NO- you don't have to put Life on Hold to wait for her to make Decisions. She handed the Parenting over to you when she LEFT.  On paper, meeting your Low Contact Father might seem like a Major Event - but as *you aren't handing Maisy over* or anything, this is really no big deal. Not any riskier than meeting any other random stranger. Your wife is just freaking out because your Father is a hot button issue for HER, and because she's unhappy that she isn't present when things are happening at home. Her expectation that you Wait For Her to make this decision is unreasonable and disrespectful. If she thinks you are unqualified to be a Responsible Guardian for Maisy, then your wife needs to get a job that allows her to be home.", "Yta as a parent you always talk to your spouse first specifically if there was some kind of abuse involved, your daughter made the right choice so please don't try to pressure her to change her mind once you reconnect with your father. This type of stuff can ruin your marriage. Be careful", "YTA. I was ambushed with an estranged parent by his mother when my other parent was out of town. I was then forced to keep that secret. Don't make solo decisions that impact your child this profoundly. Your wife should have been consulted and your estranged parent should have waited.", "Info:  if this was so urgent it couldn\u2019t wait for you to talk with your wife about it, why wasn\u2019t it considered an emergency for contact purposes?  \n\nAt 15, I agree Maisy is mature enough to decide.  But that\u2019s something you should be deciding together with your wife.  \n\nYour relationship with your father is your own business.  Provided you don\u2019t expect him to stay with you and expect your wife to meet him, etc", "NTA, and imho a good parent.  If you and your wife made the decision for your old enough to decide for herself daughter at some point you could well face the 'you never gave me a chance to meet him' outcome.  It'd be different if circumstances meant you were directly worried about any danger, or if you had decided to cut him out of your life completely - but as it was, you made the right choice.\n\nIs your wife really mad at you asking your daughter  or is she worried about you getting involved with him at all because of how he's hurt you and mad you might get taken in by him?

Along with him locking you out for losing a key", "Picture this. You've gone away for a few days for a trip. Maybe with friends for a holiday or you've gone to see your Dad on your own.\n\nWhen you come home, you find out your wife and Masey had a huge argument because your wife had suddenly decided Masey needs to get over a fear. Lets pretend she has a fear of dogs for example.\n\nAnd so your wife has locked Masey in a room overnight with a dog. The dog isn't dangerous or violent. It 100% will not hurt Masey. But she still has the dog fear and is still trapped in that room with the dog.\n\nHow angry would you be at your wife for doing this? Would you see it as abusive behaviour/parenting? Because that is EXACTLY what your father did to you.", ">It also seems like this parent shifted their emotional labor to a 15 yr old.\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by emotional labour? I only know that phrase from an academic sociological context and I have no clue how it translates to what you're saying here.", "\"shifted their emotional labor\" jesus christ come on.

Father also locked OP out until after dinner for losing a key\n\n\nI can see why OP\u2019s wife wouldn\u2019t want her 15 year old kid around this guy. \n\nBut I\u2019m withholding judgment until we get more information about why this was urgent enough for OP to make a unilateral parenting decision but not urgent enough to meet emergency contact rules for his wife.  Unless his wife is in a war zone or something.  Or a doctor or other medical person assisting with disaster relief in Turkey.", "So there's this thing. When, as children, we are hurt by our caregivers our brains will go to any length to convince us that we are not being abused. \n\nIt's VERY uncomfortable to look back and consider that maybe the childhood we thought was just \"tough\" was abusive. It sounds like you grew up with your brain protecting you by telling you that there was a justification for his actions. That's what you needed at the time. It kept you alive, and now you get to be a grown up.\n\nBut your wife is seeing this from a different perspective and is maybe furious on your behalf. Her brain never needed to find the silver lining to how your Dad treated you. She's looking at this wanting to keep people she loves safe (you and your kid). Her mind lets her feel the anger that your mind doesn't let you feel.\n\nThe way we grow up can give us blind spots. It sounds like you have some Dad-related blind spots and that doesn't make you a bad person. Your life can get better if you work on addressing them, but that's a step that you have to choose. Good luck, try to be gentle with yourself. This stuff is hard.", "You were abused and your proliclivity to down play it is why your wife is upset. You downplayed his actions on this post, she is afraid you did the same to your daughter. \n\nAdditionally, you shouldn't have considered committing to your daughter meeting him, either to her or to him, until you met him first to see if he has actually changed or was shedding crocodile tears to just lure you in.\n\nYou could have told your dad you would meet with him, but you are still tininking about him meeting your daughter, but at this point it wasn't very likely. His reaction would have told you if you should have even considered making the next steps. Not doing this makes you YTA.\n\nAll of the above is why you should have discussed w/ your wife before talking to your daughter, which gives you a second YTA."]}
