I agree that your daughter was old enough to learn some of the facts and make this decision.", "NTA. 15 is old enough to have a say. My guess is that your wife has heard some horror stories that framed her understanding of your Father and is therefore naturally protective of you and your daughter. I think you've made the right call but proceed with caution.", "NTA, at 15 Maisy is definitely able to decided who does/doesn\u2019t want to spend time with.", "NTA. Maisy is 15 and is old enough to make her own choices by now. I think you did the right thing by giving her all the info and letting her choose. That shows you respect and value her judgment and autonomy. Parenting win!", "Why should your wife get a say?\nYour daughter can control her contact with your father, regardless of you or her.\n\nNta", "NTA, at 15 Maisy is definitely able to decided who does/doesn\u2019t want to spend time with.", "NTA 15 is old enough to make a decision like that. I hope you and your father come to an understanding before he passes.", "Info: Why is your wife against Maisy and her grandfather meeting?", "Info: what were the creative parenting methods? Big difference between a kooky parent and one who physically chastises the child.", "NTA. But neither is your wife.\nYour fathers methods don\u2019t sound creative, the examples you have given are abuse. I don\u2019t blame your wife for having strong feelings about having them meet, bcs it sounds as though you don\u2019t quite realise how abusive his behaviour was. \nSaying that, having an open discussion with your daughter who is 15, and respecting her decision is good parenting. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t take after your dad", "INFO: I do not understand why Maisy shouldn't meet your dad.  You didn't like him as a parent, but he wouldn't be Maisy's parent.  They would just meet, and that would be that.  There's something missing from the story as far as why your wife wouldn't even want them to meet.", "Make a dying man wait a long time for an answer vs not consult your coparent on an important choice. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to make the argument that you\u2019re an AH, unless you broke an existing parenting agreement. I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t. \n\nSince you followed the existing parenting rules and made a choice, NTA. Your wife\u2019s inability to accept that is concerning, and suggests that you two need to sit down and reestablish rules for how to handle situations that arise while she\u2019s away for work. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour daghter is old enough to make the decision of whether she wants to see her grandfather. Your wife is out of the country and not easy to reach on a daily basis, and needs to trust that you do the best you can while she is away.", "I think the sad thing is that as children we might not agree with things that were done to us & would never do them to our own children... but we don't actually realise how awful our situation actually was. If your wife had a regular childhood, hearing your stories would have been very upsetting. I think YTA because you did know your wife's feelings & I wouldn't want my child at 15 or 25 around a man who could sleep knowing he'd locked his terrified child in a cupboard.", "NAH. You've claimed that your Father wasn't abusive but some of the examples you've given in the comments do imply a slightly different story. I think sometimes it's not as easy for those on the inside to recognise it, especially with parents. I think your wife probably has good reasons to feel concerned based on the information you've provided her but ultimately I do believe that a 15 year old has the capacity to decide for herself.", "I\u2019m reading your reasons for his creative parenting and honestly I don\u2019t understand why your wife wouldn\u2019t even let them meet. That sounds\u2026 just\u2026 absurdly unreasonable to me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your father was abusive not creative.", "NTA. Your daughter is old enough to decide for herself, and she chose correctly because she can see your ABUSIVE father for what he is. Glad she was raised right and can recognize signs that your clearly ignoring because \u201cyou turned out fine lol\u201d. I do understand your wife\u2019s apprehensions since your dad was an ABUSIVE person, she\u2019s probably exaggerating a bit due to her not being close by and only allowing emergency contact. I\u2019m imagining military or some high paying job that\u2019s very stressful.", "Because she's still a child and I suspect op is severely sugar coating how badly the grandfather behaved.  It could be endangering her.", "He was never violent, or I wouldn't even consider letting him near my kid! He just had weird ideas, like locking me in the closet overnight to help me get over my fear of the dark, or letting me smoke and drink with him starting when I was around 10. He was very much a 'throw the kid in the water to teach them how to swim' type. It was a different time lol", "My wife knows the stuff I've told her from her childhood, and even though I wouldn't treat Maisy the same, my wife might be worried I would? Or that my dad would act like he did towards me? I just know that on the rare occasion my dad comes up in convo, my wife is very clear that she doesn't like him despite having never met him", "I wouldn't call him abusive, but I can understand that I maybe should have waited to talk to my wife since I know she doesn't like my dad", "And daughter said no....", "I'd personally rather be beat than locked in a closet. That sounds like torture.", "Hitting isn't the only form of abuse. The things you mention him doing are just as bad. You say it must have worked because you barely remember it, but not remembering or not having feelings about it can be a trauma response, and in any case it's not proof of it doing any good.\n\nI'm not sure this is a case of anyone being TA at all. But I do get where your wife is coming from with her (maybe over)protectiveness when you're kind of glib about him doing terrible things. She might be worried about whether you've got a realistic sense of what behavior toward Maisy would be okay for him to do when this is how you talk about the abuse he put you through.", "NTA, I guess.  I'm not hearing any reason they can't *meet*.", "While it probably sucked at the time, it's long enough ago that I barely remember more than that it happened, so it must've worked lol. Just like the time when I lost my house key so my dad wouldn't let me inside until after dinner, and I never lost another key after that. So you could say that his parenting worked, even if I would never do the same for my daughter.", "You said he wasn't abusive. But locking a child in a dark closet to get over a fear IS abuse.", "Dude, you WERE abused. You were abused and scared by your dad your whole childhood."]}
