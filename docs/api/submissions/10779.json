My stepfathers parents both passed not too long after they got married.  Abby has always hated going over to my grandparents, and she\u2019s not always nice to them. She has no desire for them to have any type of a relationship.   \n  Abby and I were super close growing up. But something changed after high school.  I left for college and she stayed home, then dropped out of community college to pursue another opportunity, but it fell through. \n\nWhen I came home for Thanksgiving break I could tell things were off between us. She\u2019d blow me off and wouldn\u2019t talk to me.  Then the same thing happened over Christmas break. I\u2019ve sent texts and calls all read but none responded to. I then reached out to my mom to see if she knew anything, and she said she figured it was jealousy, so i gave her space. \nHer birthday is right around the first of the year. So that day I sent her flowers, ordered her food on doordash, and sent her a corny text message. I didn\u2019t do any of it for her to \u201cpraise\u201d me, but I did expect a text back. But I got nothing. \n\nFast forward three weeks to my birthday, I flew home so my family and I could have dinner together. Abby opted not to come. At dinner my grandmas gave me a diamond necklace that was a family heirloom. She wore this necklace everyday and had promised me since I was a little girl that one day it would be mine.\n\nAbby was in the living room when we all walked in from dinner, immediately she saw I had the necklace on. This is when all hell broke loose. \nShe jumped up from the couch and got about 3 inches from my face screaming that I knew she loved that necklace. And that she had begged for it to be left to her. So I snapped back and said it was a family heirloom and that it has always been mine. \n\nShe then said I implied she wasn\u2019t family and how I was a self centered bitch. I told her she didn\u2019t want to start with me. And she said since the necklace is supposed to be given to the first granddaughter we should sell it and split the money so it\u2019s fair. At this point I had enough, and I told her no and that she just wanted the necklace for the money and she didn\u2019t care or couldn\u2019t begin to appreciate the history behind the necklace. And that she didn\u2019t even love my grandparents, and that they were just money signs to her. Abby then stormed up stairs packed a bag and left. \n\nShe\u2019s now not returning anyone\u2019s calls and says she will come home after I agree to split it with her or give her the necklace. My mom and stepfather think I took it too far and that I was a jerk. And I should just split the necklace with her to end this nonsense.

The fact is, this isnt about the necklace, this is just her excuse to attack you and make her to be the victim.  Why?  Because she has been cutting you off and treating you like dirt, because she is jealous of you because of her own life choices. Your getting everything SHE WANTS AND ITS NOT FAIR!\n\n\nLet me guess, she didn't like that she couldn't afford to go to or couldn't get into better schools?  Is that what she is jealous of?  Or was it that she expected you to not go off to college and do what she did?  Or did she just make the choice to stay back and then drop out for no good reason, and she now resents you for making better choices and is projecting onto you?\n\n\nI think she came at you thinking you would just take it off and give it to her, she knows you have been trying to connect with her, what she didn't expect was for you to defend yourself and tell her the truth, this is a family heirloom and it was always meant to be yours.  She is still part of the family, and you weren't saying she wasn't, but it would be like you demanding a family heirloom from her dad's mother, it's different.

Somehow, she has made you a stand-in for her own feelings of inadequacy. You didn\u2019t make her do that, and her treating you aggressively is not ok for any reason. She raged. And rage isnt normal anger. It is triggered and out of control. If you think about it, you\u2019ll likely realize you felt something coming-tension building. You tried to diffuse it with a kind gift. Good move. Didn\u2019t work. Further evidence this isn\u2019t about you. The stuff she said isn\u2019t about you. It isnt. Even if it\u2019s sometimes true (most of us aren\u2019t perfect), you did not make this happen with her. You aren\u2019t responsible for whatever she is spewing at you. If it helps, think of anger and rage as different things. Anger is when you get pissed off, maybe complain, say something pissy, even raise your voice. Rage is when you lose it, spew hateful things, break or throw something. Rage is not just huge anger. Rage leaves recipients feeling like we just got hit by a tornado, and shocked. Her behavior isn\u2019t just intense anger, \u201cvery angry at me\u201d. She isn\u2019t \u201cvery angry at\u201d you. She is triggered. What that means is there\u2019s no point in any response you can have to this other than somebody helping her get to therapy. We own our triggers, and it is our responsibility to be aware of them and manage them. She can do that now, or when she\u2019s 40 after it has cost her relationships and even jobs. Point is, you can\u2019t do it for her. You aren\u2019t responsible for her triggers, and you cannot manage them. This means you aren\u2019t obliged to discuss your part of this with parents or her. This wasn\u2019t about you. And do yourself a favor and view her as \u201cclearly wounded\u201d instead of making judgements about who she is based on this.  Most of us have some triggers and behave poorly on the rare occasion we get triggered, but we aren\u2019t hateful, awful people. The way she acted was not ok, not reflective of her genuine feelings toward you, not about you, and not under your influence.  \u201cit\u2019s so worrisome that she is so troubled by things that she\u2019s acting that way. I know she would never want to hurt me. Maybe it\u2019s time for a counselor\u201d.  Say the same to her if prompted. Be humble- everyone has a strong feeling wash over them without invitation, causing them to overreact or under react dramatically at least once in life.
