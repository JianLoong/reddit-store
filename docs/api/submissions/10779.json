My stepfathers parents both passed not too long after they got married.  Abby has always hated going over to my grandparents, and she\u2019s not always nice to them. She has no desire for them to have any type of a relationship.   \n  Abby and I were super close growing up. But something changed after high school.  I left for college and she stayed home, then dropped out of community college to pursue another opportunity, but it fell through. \n\nWhen I came home for Thanksgiving break I could tell things were off between us. She\u2019d blow me off and wouldn\u2019t talk to me.  Then the same thing happened over Christmas break. I\u2019ve sent texts and calls all read but none responded to. I then reached out to my mom to see if she knew anything, and she said she figured it was jealousy, so i gave her space. \nHer birthday is right around the first of the year. So that day I sent her flowers, ordered her food on doordash, and sent her a corny text message. I didn\u2019t do any of it for her to \u201cpraise\u201d me, but I did expect a text back. But I got nothing. \n\nFast forward three weeks to my birthday, I flew home so my family and I could have dinner together. Abby opted not to come. At dinner my grandmas gave me a diamond necklace that was a family heirloom. She wore this necklace everyday and had promised me since I was a little girl that one day it would be mine.\n\nAbby was in the living room when we all walked in from dinner, immediately she saw I had the necklace on. This is when all hell broke loose. \nShe jumped up from the couch and got about 3 inches from my face screaming that I knew she loved that necklace. And that she had begged for it to be left to her. So I snapped back and said it was a family heirloom and that it has always been mine. \n\nShe then said I implied she wasn\u2019t family and how I was a self centered bitch. I told her she didn\u2019t want to start with me. And she said since the necklace is supposed to be given to the first granddaughter we should sell it and split the money so it\u2019s fair. At this point I had enough, and I told her no and that she just wanted the necklace for the money and she didn\u2019t care or couldn\u2019t begin to appreciate the history behind the necklace. And that she didn\u2019t even love my grandparents, and that they were just money signs to her. Abby then stormed up stairs packed a bag and left. \n\nShe\u2019s now not returning anyone\u2019s calls and says she will come home after I agree to split it with her or give her the necklace. My mom and stepfather think I took it too far and that I was a jerk. And I should just split the necklace with her to end this nonsense.

Your stepsister was way out of bounds with her demand and behaving ridiculously. Mum and dad better tell her to stop this nonsense. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n\nYou know who took it too far?

Your mom and step dad, and anyone else supporting her ridiculous demand.\n\n\nThis was a family heirloom from your grandmother, who not only is your blood relative, but who has been in your life and you in hers since the day you were born, so regardless of who is older or who is blood, YOU ARE THE FIRST GRANDDAUGHTER.  \n\n\nAbby wanted no relationship with them, didn't see them as grandparents, BUT she expected to inherit from them.   The fact is, this isnt about the necklace, this is just her excuse to attack you and make her to be the victim.  Why?  Because she has been cutting you off and treating you like dirt, because she is jealous of you because of her own life choices. Your getting everything SHE WANTS AND ITS NOT FAIR!\n\n\nLet me guess, she didn't like that she couldn't afford to go to or couldn't get into better schools?  Is that what she is jealous of?  Or was it that she expected you to not go off to college and do what she did?  Or did she just make the choice to stay back and then drop out for no good reason, and she now resents you for making better choices and is projecting onto you?\n\n\nI think she came at you thinking you would just take it off and give it to her, she knows you have been trying to connect with her, what she didn't expect was for you to defend yourself and tell her the truth, this is a family heirloom and it was always meant to be yours.  She is still part of the family, and you weren't saying she wasn't, but it would be like you demanding a family heirloom from her dad's mother, it's different.

Tell your parents that they need to see the situation for what it was, that it's not your fault her feelings were hurt, that she didn't care about your feelings for all this time and she didn't care about confronting you and starting this.

I dont know many black people who can say they\u2019ve received such a thing. I live in a country where black people could only start building up their wealth and livelihoods in 1994.
