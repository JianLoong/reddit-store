My stepfathers parents both passed not too long after they got married.  Abby has always hated going over to my grandparents, and she\u2019s not always nice to them. She has no desire for them to have any type of a relationship.   \n  Abby and I were super close growing up. But something changed after high school.  I left for college and she stayed home, then dropped out of community college to pursue another opportunity, but it fell through. \n\nWhen I came home for Thanksgiving break I could tell things were off between us. She\u2019d blow me off and wouldn\u2019t talk to me.  Then the same thing happened over Christmas break. I\u2019ve sent texts and calls all read but none responded to. I then reached out to my mom to see if she knew anything, and she said she figured it was jealousy, so i gave her space. \nHer birthday is right around the first of the year. So that day I sent her flowers, ordered her food on doordash, and sent her a corny text message. I didn\u2019t do any of it for her to \u201cpraise\u201d me, but I did expect a text back. But I got nothing. \n\nFast forward three weeks to my birthday, I flew home so my family and I could have dinner together. Abby opted not to come. At dinner my grandmas gave me a diamond necklace that was a family heirloom. She wore this necklace everyday and had promised me since I was a little girl that one day it would be mine.\n\nAbby was in the living room when we all walked in from dinner, immediately she saw I had the necklace on. This is when all hell broke loose. \nShe jumped up from the couch and got about 3 inches from my face screaming that I knew she loved that necklace. And that she had begged for it to be left to her. So I snapped back and said it was a family heirloom and that it has always been mine. \n\nShe then said I implied she wasn\u2019t family and how I was a self centered bitch. I told her she didn\u2019t want to start with me. And she said since the necklace is supposed to be given to the first granddaughter we should sell it and split the money so it\u2019s fair. At this point I had enough, and I told her no and that she just wanted the necklace for the money and she didn\u2019t care or couldn\u2019t begin to appreciate the history behind the necklace. And that she didn\u2019t even love my grandparents, and that they were just money signs to her. Abby then stormed up stairs packed a bag and left. \n\nShe\u2019s now not returning anyone\u2019s calls and says she will come home after I agree to split it with her or give her the necklace. My mom and stepfather think I took it too far and that I was a jerk. And I should just split the necklace with her to end this nonsense.

Watch out.  She'll steal it.", "NTA. Your grandmother gave it to you, not Abby. You're not obligated to sell a family heirloom given to you as a gift. It's outrageous that she would even ask.", "NTA. She doesn't get to be rude to your grandma, and then demanding family heirloom after not wanting to have any kind of relationship with her. She herself clearly doesn't see your grandma as her family, and now she is accusing you of implying she is not family.  \nTo be honest, she sounds to be extremely entitled person.  \nPlease, make sure she doesn't get her hands on that necklace.", "Sounds to me like this is not the first time your stepsister has been difficult given the fact your mom/step dad aren\u2019t handling her behaviour themselves.\n\nGet a safety deposit box for the necklace.

Obviously something is going on with her, could be jealousy or shame or something more that you arn't being told, idk, but none of it makes any of this your fault OR responsibility. Your grandma literally gave you the necklace, even if it wasn't a family heirloom it is still her choice. Don't sell or share it, and keep that thing very safe and far away from Abby AND your parents for the time being just to be on the safe side because they should not be advocating you have joint custody over a peice of jewelry because she's throwing a massive tantrum.", "\"You know i loved that necklace, so we should sell it\"\n\nThats completely logical\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAbby wins top prize, and your parents are a close second for even entertaining the idea you should split the necklace just to keep the peace.

She never wanted to have a relationship with her grandparents and now when the necklace comes into the picture she suddenly is interested ? \n\nAnd don't sell it or split it ! It's a family heirloom and you realise it's importance and that's why you are cherishing it. Meanwhile she seems to be wanting the money/ just jealous that you have it. \n\nAlso be careful.. if she can go to the extent of not coming home wanting the necklace ..i believe she can do something further...just saying.", "NTA. Your step sister is an entitled piece of work. Get a safety deposit box at a bank and lock that baby up. She's dangerous and she will try to spite you. I'd be careful wearing it around her, she may try to ruin it.", "NTA, your Grandmother passed on a sentimental necklace to you, unfortunately she\u2019s your step sister and is no way entitled to anything your Grandmother gives you. I\u2019d be hiding the necklace, and telling your parents If it\u2019s about the money they should be happy to give Abby some!", "NTA - It was a gift to you from your own grandmother.  She has her own grandparents to leave her things (which I don't think she would be sharing with you), and apparently didnt want a relationship with your extended family.", "Nta and nope.\n\n\nNever bring that necklace near to her.", "Nope, that necklace is yours period.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give her s***. She can not come home then and shame on your mother and stepfather for siding with her.", "Get that necklace somewhere safe. You can not trust your mom not to take it and either give it to your SS or sell it. She treated your maternal grandparents like shit. If she had treated them well, while she still wouldn't have been entitled to a family heirloom, she might have received something. NTA, that would be your stepsister and your mom & stepdad for siding with her. Everything you said about her was true. She has no claim to the necklace.", "NTA.

Do not let go of that necklace otherwise you'll regret it. Remember it came from the heart of someone precious to you.", "NTA.\n\nHeirlooms seem to cause quite a few conflicts.\n\nSelling it will destroy the heirloom. That would be the dumbest thing to do.\n\nGuard the thing well, so it doesn't dissappear.\n\nIf its really to be split (only your grandmother can decide that) then I guess you could buy her share of the necklace... but that's giving in to her tantrum.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So she is treating you like crap for some time now, doesn't talk to you and doesn't even say a word when you send something over for her birthday, yet when you receive a present from YOUR grandma she demands at least half of it and your mom and stepdad are on her side?\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with your stepsister and even the rest of your family? Your stepsister was way out of bounds with her demand and behaving ridiculously. Mum and dad better tell her to stop this nonsense. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n\nYou know who took it too far? ABBY!\n\n\nYou know who is being an entitled jealous toddler? ABBY!\n\n\nYou know who is enabling Abby's behavior? Your mom and step dad, and anyone else supporting her ridiculous demand.\n\n\nThis was a family heirloom from your grandmother, who not only is your blood relative, but who has been in your life and you in hers since the day you were born, so regardless of who is older or who is blood, YOU ARE THE FIRST GRANDDAUGHTER.  \n\n\nAbby wanted no relationship with them, didn't see them as grandparents, BUT she expected to inherit from them.   The fact is, this isnt about the necklace, this is just her excuse to attack you and make her to be the victim.  Why?  Because she has been cutting you off and treating you like dirt, because she is jealous of you because of her own life choices. Your getting everything SHE WANTS AND ITS NOT FAIR!\n\n\nLet me guess, she didn't like that she couldn't afford to go to or couldn't get into better schools?  Is that what she is jealous of?  Or was it that she expected you to not go off to college and do what she did?  Or did she just make the choice to stay back and then drop out for no good reason, and she now resents you for making better choices and is projecting onto you?\n\n\nI think she came at you thinking you would just take it off and give it to her, she knows you have been trying to connect with her, what she didn't expect was for you to defend yourself and tell her the truth, this is a family heirloom and it was always meant to be yours.  She is still part of the family, and you weren't saying she wasn't, but it would be like you demanding a family heirloom from her dad's mother, it's different.  Not to mention, even if she was close with your grandmother, your grandmother promised it to you.\n\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter.  IT WAS NEVER HER NECKLACE TO DEMAND!!\n\n\nSHE CHOSE TO CONFRONT YOU!!\n\n\nTHIS ISNT ABOUT HER WANTING THE NECKLACE. IT'S ABOUT HER NOT WANTING YOU TO HAVE IT, WHICH IS WHY SHE WANTS TO SELL IT!\n\n\nSo let her have her tantrum while you travel back to school WITH THE NECKLACE (or put it in a safety deposit box, cause if your mom holds it, it will go missing).   Tell your parents that they need to see the situation for what it was, that it's not your fault her feelings were hurt, that she didn't care about your feelings for all this time and she didn't care about confronting you and starting this.  That she isnt entitled to treat you like this or to demand anything.\n\n\nPlease don't sell it, if you do it won't solve her issues and it would make you TA if you did.", "NTA and I dont think you should continue to think of her as a sister. She isn't acting like she thinks of you as family and it sounds abit like she might me into some stuff that other might not approve of with the way she is distancing and only caring about monetary value of your family's sentimental pieces. (Drugs, sounds like drugs) dont trust her and yay keep the necklace with your person when at your parents or put it in a safety deposit box along with any other valuables you wouldn't want her stealing. Abby is in the wrong and your mom and step dad want to keep the peace by pretending everything is fine and its not fine. Sisters don't ignore each other like that. Not even a thank you or a hey Im busy is complete bullsheet.", "The way your parents are reacting to this unreasonable request by your stepsister could explain how at 20, she's still acting like a 5-year-old. Have they always given in to her tantrums? There is absolutely no reason you should have to split a GIFT with her. NTA and maybe give yourself some space from your parents and stepsister. Take steps to ensure the necklace is safe and documented as yours. Enjoy the gift and memories, and live your life. If they bring it up, shut it down and let them know you are done talking about it.", "NTA Keep the necklace safe, away from your mother especially. She's not on your side.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s acting like a spoiled brat. Absolutely do not give her that necklace nor sell it. Keep it someone where safe in case she or someone else tries to take it from you. And stop begging for her attention. If she doesn\u2019t want to talk, fine. Continue to live your life. And be firm with your mom and her husband and let them know that what they are saying is not ok and you don\u2019t appreciate how they\u2019re taking her side when they see how she\u2019s been treating you.", "I was thinking the same thing. \n\nNTA and your mom needs to quit trying to placate her husband and stepdaughter and step up and do the right thing. Tell your grandma they are trying to demand you sell the necklace. I am sure she would love her daughter is trying to force you to sell a treasured family heirloom to make her new family happy.", "This is a fact I came here to state, Abby seems too spoiled, with 0 prospects of any future, probably why she's so desperate for the cash...", "I'd go as far as saying you're obligated to not sell a family heirloom", "Yea her parents are 100% enabling.\n\n\n\nShe hates OP cause she GETS EVERYTHING ABBY WANTS!", "I find it funny that she had no close relationship with the grandmother, yet said she had already asked for it to be left to her.\n\n\nLike did she ask the grandmother she had a distant relationship with for her diamonds?  Or was this a case of her telling/demanding to OPs mom that she wanted it.  I bet anything OP doesn't realize that Abby always knew it would be OPs, and that she and Abby were not as close as she thought.", "But why would she even buy her stepsister\u2019s share on the necklace when she literally has no share in it. She has zero claim, zero entitlement, zero anything to the necklace and gets zero out of it. Sounds like pure jealousy.", "> only her grandmother can decide that\n\nThat's why that phrase is in my comment.\n\nAs soon as the grandmother decides she has a share in it, she has a share in it...\n\nNot that that would be a good thing though."]}
