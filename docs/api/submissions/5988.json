We both live together in Malaysia and have for the past few years. I've spent christmas with her family in Malaysia 3 years in a row. This year, we traveled to the US to visit my family for Christmas. Our plan was for me to stay until mid January since I hadn't seen my family since Pre-covid times, and for her to go back on the 28th so she didn't need to take too much time off work.\n\nI paid for our flights with credit card points which required me to book two one way trips for each of us. I booked us in Business class both ways. My girlfriend had never flown at all before and was excited for her first flights to be in Business class.\n\nUnfortunately, she complained about how it wasn't very nice almost every step of the way back (It was 26 hours of flight time). She complained that the bed wasn't comfortable. She said the food was terrible. She complained that the lounges were too busy. She even complained that the privacy partition and door at her seat on the plane were pointless since they weren't high enough and people could see over them. She also said the wine selection wasn't extensive enough.\n\nI told her it was still infinitely better than Economy class and she said \"I doubt that. I actually wouldn't mind flying back in Economy since Business was so shit\". I tried to show her how cramped economy is and how little privacy she'd have, but she said \"Business didn't have any privacy either. Seriously, save your points and just get me an economy ticket back\". So, I went ahead and downgraded her flight back ti Malaysia to save the 85k points difference since she really didn't like Business class anyway.\n\nWhile she was en route home she texted me from the plane saying \"I can't believe you'd let me fly like all the way back to Malaysia like this. This is awful\". I reminded her that she said business class was also awful, and she said she wouldn't mind flying back economy, but she's still pissed and convinced I'm an asshole for changing the flight. \n\nAITA for changing her flight when I knew she'd hate economy class? She's convinced that I am, but I think that's a bit unfair as she explicitly told me she wanted me to change her flight to economy and she ignored my recommendation to look at what that might be like before I changed it.", "created_utc": 1672381940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zytb6f/aita_for_downgrading_my_girlfriends_flight_from/", "score": 731, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds exhausting and I\u2019m not sure there is any way out for you other than calling it off with her and finding someone else who would be grateful to have such opportunities. \n\nGood luck!", "She sounds awful.", "Sounds like she would\u2019ve been miserable in business class, miserable in first class, and miserable in coach. NTA", "Business class is first on long haul flights.", "To be honest, I 'd have flown us to the states in economy and back in business but I have Multiple Sclerosis and flying in economy would actually knock me on my ass for weeks after lol. I didn't want to be an asshole and have her sat in economy while I was up in Biz so I just booked us both in biz. I figured she'd pop back and take a look at the economy section and be happy she was in biz but no such luck lol.", "Oh I actually didn't fly with her. I hung back in the states with my family a bit longer, which we had planned from the beginning. If I had been flying back at the same time as her I'd not have downgraded her tbh because I can't really fly economy on long flights (I have multiple sclerosis and not being able to lay down and/or put my feet up would cause a really bad flare up) and I wouldn't have felt right having her in the back while I was up front lol.", "Her primary seat was a window seat, but the flight was undersold so the flight attendants made up the middle seats for us to sleep in so we could sleep together (the middle seats have a partition between them that goes down so they can form a double bed).", "[removed]", "She never said economy would be more comfortable, she said she thought that they weren\u2019t that different. And the idea that the more expensive version must be better is silly \u2014 the world is full of upgrades that are definitely not worth their monetary value", " Is that really what you want from a partner?", "Meh, I've done premium economy that was actually worse than economy. Leather seats that were less comfortable (plus couldn't put down the armrests and lie across a row), and fancy real cutlery/glasses which might theoretically be nicer but in such a cramped space it's just a pain.", "THat's how it is when a relationship is based on financial transactions:", "Is there anything positive about her as a person that explains why you're still with her?", "OP she doesn't appreciate all the nice things you do for her. Dump her", "She sounds ungrateful as hell. NTA Do you really want this to be every event in the future?", "Some people just feel the need to be negative about good experiences to demonstrate their supposed sophistication (film critics are high up on that list). I'd challenge your girlfriend on that attitude pattern, if she brings up the downgrade again. NTA.", "Sounds like my ex", "Cathay is pretty great, even economy! I got upgraded by Cathay to premium economy once (the joys of being a sole traveller with a pretty high status in an alliance), and O.M.G.! Game changer! Qatar's business class must be amazing! PS - NTA, obviously.", "So first off, whoever said business food sucks has not tried EVAS, Air Canada, or Turkish when it was amazing like a decade or so ago. The food I had on EVAS business was better than a lot of upscale restaurants I've been to. \n\nTwo, OP, you seem oddly ok with recognizing the overall lack of gratitude and effort from your gf. Even if I don't like something my partner got me, I always make a point of saying thank you and acknowledging the effort/forethought that went into the action/present/experience/ whatever you want to call it. Because that should be recognized. Because he didn't need to be kind and go out of his way to think of my comfort or what I might like. \n\nI'm not saying this as a criticism, it's your relationship, do what you want. I know that if I were in your place, I'd feel at the very least continually disheartened. At the worst, like I'd never be good enough. \n\nAgain, if this isn't a problem in your eyes, then it's not a problem. I do think it's worth a ponder though to make sure that's actually the case. \n\nEither way,  NTA.", "Sounds amazing. My one long distance flight was UK to Australia return with my sister and my almost 2 year old niece - who didn't have her own seat as she was under 2.

Good lord she doesn\u2019t realize how good she had it. \n\nMy dad was a flight engineer, so growing up I knew nothing but first class/business class. Always spent time in airports in the lounge and usually boarded the plane with the crew and would play a bit in the cockpit (Pre 9/11). Only time I would be in economy would be on ferry flights, and that only because it would be fun having an entire 747 to ourselves. After he passed away those perks were gone and I realized at that point just how good I had it. So yeah, i think an economy experience as her first ever flight may have been better in hindsight.\n\nI\u2019m still shaking my head at her saying Qatar business the basically the same as economy, lmao", "Eh?", "If her first time flying is as an adult, I'm not surprised she found it horrible. We're all conditioned to accept it. Flying is a bit inhumane. You were kind to ease her into it with business class. But she got what she asked for.

Better to knock it down a few pegs by finding something to criticise.

They were my first business class flight actually and I raved about the food for weeks to my friends and family to the point they all told me to chill about it lol. \n\nThis was such a kind and tactful comment I'm actually shook haha. Thanks for taking the time and for kindly nudging me towards taking a step back to evaluate things. \n\nTo be honest, I think I've just gotten so used to her complaining over basically everything over the past few years it doesn't even really register to me anymore. The only reason I made this post is because she was pissed at me for the downgrade and decided she wouldn't talk to me for a few weeks, didn't even occur to me the complaining itself was problematic.", "That's a bot who stole part of one of the OPs comments and posted it in a random spot. Hence why it makes zero sense.", "Let's be real. How hot is she? And is she even half your age? There is a reason you are with her and it isn't attitude. So it must be sex.", "Caring for a loved one with a condition like that can be a big deal. I wish you luck, OP. I hope you can better communicate with her on this, have a chat about both of your expectations or something. You can figure out where her head is at better than the Internet probably.

Just swipe on tinder theres plenty of nice girls dont wear yourself down with her complains.", "It looks amazing and I\u2019m loving the course names.", "Thank you. I am sick to death of all the misuse of that word, especially on this sub.", "My work is mostly in the Middle East and Africa so I haven't had the chance to try out a lot of the East Asian ones, have definitely heard great things about Singapore.", "Qantas is also excellent though, to be fair lol.", "A few weeks?! That's extreme", "Lol thanks for kindly correcting me re EVA! I kept looking at it and thinking that wasn't the right name, but it's 545 AM and I'm not a morning person. \n\nAnd of course! It's always so so so difficult to see all aspects of a situation when you're in the midst of it, especially when it comes to romantic relationships. But apparently that's what internet strangers are for! \n\nThere are things we all get used to, because people aren't great and the world is kind of a nightmare, but it's sad that we've gotten used to it and accepted it. Like basically anything related to woman's rights or healthcare in the US. Or those of us who love Chicago but accepted that it's super crime ridden despite absurdly high taxes that should be more than enough to implement short/ long term solutions. But that 1) doesn't mean we should normalize these things and 2) makes it even more important to surround ourselves with people who we love and trust and who will support us in kind. \n\nAlso, how long did she decide she's not taking to you? There's a huge difference between I'm too angry to talk about this/ the time isn't right/ I want us to be in person vs I'm punishing you by not talking to you (especially over something I asked you to do).", "That sounds miserable :/ her constant complaining. Wonder how long youll be able to live with that.", "Thank you, I thought it looked like a bot but couldn\u2019t find the original comment", "haha \"weeks\" was definitely a bit hyperbolic. I just talked about it a bit too much to the point I was getting ribbed by my fam and friends about it lol.", "They meant a few weeks if her not talking to you, not about your food orgasm.", "Think they meant the silent treatment!", "Oof hahaha. I'm dumb, please pardon me. That makes a lot more sense.", "I honestly don't see you as dumb, just very inclined towards kindness and generosity. You assumed the comment about a few weeks was about your gushing about the food because you automatically disconnected from the negativity of her using the silent treatment on you. \n\nThere is no shame in being kind, or generous, or a caregiver. If anything, maintaining that type of positivity in this world is tough as hell, and it should be respected. \n\nBut it does lead to people like us (I'm a caregiver as well) being taken advantage of, so we have to be very aware of who we interact with, and have relationships with. \n\nThe advice I had gotten once (from someone that I no longer consider a friend, but it *was* solid advice) was to sometimes look at how you are being treated, and think \"Ok, what would (insert name of the harshest friend you have here) do in response to this? Would they be happy/sad/furious?\". And it worked. Not saying that I changed to a clone of the harsh friend, but that it forced me to think from a different perspective and see if I truly was being treated the way that I should be.", "Lol. Seems you're a little blind to how abnormal her behaviour is :("]}
