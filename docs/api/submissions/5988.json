We both live together in Malaysia and have for the past few years. I've spent christmas with her family in Malaysia 3 years in a row. This year, we traveled to the US to visit my family for Christmas. Our plan was for me to stay until mid January since I hadn't seen my family since Pre-covid times, and for her to go back on the 28th so she didn't need to take too much time off work.\n\nI paid for our flights with credit card points which required me to book two one way trips for each of us. I booked us in Business class both ways. My girlfriend had never flown at all before and was excited for her first flights to be in Business class.\n\nUnfortunately, she complained about how it wasn't very nice almost every step of the way back (It was 26 hours of flight time). She complained that the bed wasn't comfortable. She said the food was terrible. She complained that the lounges were too busy. She even complained that the privacy partition and door at her seat on the plane were pointless since they weren't high enough and people could see over them. She also said the wine selection wasn't extensive enough.\n\nI told her it was still infinitely better than Economy class and she said \"I doubt that. I actually wouldn't mind flying back in Economy since Business was so shit\". I tried to show her how cramped economy is and how little privacy she'd have, but she said \"Business didn't have any privacy either. Seriously, save your points and just get me an economy ticket back\". So, I went ahead and downgraded her flight back ti Malaysia to save the 85k points difference since she really didn't like Business class anyway.\n\nWhile she was en route home she texted me from the plane saying \"I can't believe you'd let me fly like all the way back to Malaysia like this. This is awful\". I reminded her that she said business class was also awful, and she said she wouldn't mind flying back economy, but she's still pissed and convinced I'm an asshole for changing the flight. \n\nAITA for changing her flight when I knew she'd hate economy class? She's convinced that I am, but I think that's a bit unfair as she explicitly told me she wanted me to change her flight to economy and she ignored my recommendation to look at what that might be like before I changed it.", "created_utc": 1672381940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zytb6f/aita_for_downgrading_my_girlfriends_flight_from/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I kind of knew she would hate economy, but I decided to downgrade her anyway since she repeatedly told me to. I can see why she would be upset about that, but at the same time she refused to walk into the economy class cabin or look at pictures/videos of what it would be like before telling me to downgrade her so I think she's more to blame here than me. She's actually refusing to speak to me until I come back to Malaysia (In 2 weeks) over this.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
