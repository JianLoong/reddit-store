This year, we traveled to the US to visit my family for Christmas. Our plan was for me to stay until mid January since I hadn't seen my family since Pre-covid times, and for her to go back on the 28th so she didn't need to take too much time off work.\n\nI paid for our flights with credit card points which required me to book two one way trips for each of us. I booked us in Business class both ways. My girlfriend had never flown at all before and was excited for her first flights to be in Business class.\n\nUnfortunately, she complained about how it wasn't very nice almost every step of the way back (It was 26 hours of flight time). She complained that the bed wasn't comfortable. She said the food was terrible. She complained that the lounges were too busy. She even complained that the privacy partition and door at her seat on the plane were pointless since they weren't high enough and people could see over them. She also said the wine selection wasn't extensive enough.\n\nI told her it was still infinitely better than Economy class and she said \"I doubt that. I actually wouldn't mind flying back in Economy since Business was so shit\". I tried to show her how cramped economy is and how little privacy she'd have, but she said \"Business didn't have any privacy either. Seriously, save your points and just get me an economy ticket back\". So, I went ahead and downgraded her flight back ti Malaysia to save the 85k points difference since she really didn't like Business class anyway.\n\nWhile she was en route home she texted me from the plane saying \"I can't believe you'd let me fly like all the way back to Malaysia like this. This is awful\". I reminded her that she said business class was also awful, and she said she wouldn't mind flying back economy, but she's still pissed and convinced I'm an asshole for changing the flight. \n\nAITA for changing her flight when I knew she'd hate economy class? She's convinced that I am, but I think that's a bit unfair as she explicitly told me she wanted me to change her flight to economy and she ignored my recommendation to look at what that might be like before I changed it.", "created_utc": 1672381940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zytb6f/aita_for_downgrading_my_girlfriends_flight_from/", "score": 1516, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you need to have a sit down converted with her about this if you guys want kids because this kind of attitude can be actively damaging to them and that's just not fair. Is her mother like this as well?", "Miserable on a private jet too I bet", "I can't stop laughing at the thought of bitching about long haul flights in business class *in general*, much less on Qatar Airways.  \n\nCathay Pacific has some of the widest/roomiest economy class seats, too, so her trip back was arguably more comfortable than it would have been on many other carriers.  \n\nHer only potential saving grace here is that it was her first flight ever, but given some of your other comments she sounds like an ungrateful pampered princess who will never be happy with anything you give her.  \n\nShe fucked around and found out.", "That varies by airline and route, although it is the direction the industry is going.", "I read bed, partition, door, wine selection! WTH sounds awesome.", ">  And the idea that the more expensive version must be better is silly \u2014 the world is full of upgrades that are definitely not worth their monetary value\n\nThese are two completely different concepts.  I don't think it's silly to assume the higher priced version of a product offering (by the same company) is better, because that's almost always how it works.  The second half of your statement is true, but it doesn't negate the first part. Yes, there are many upgrades that aren't worth their value, but that doesn't mean the upgraded version isn't better than the base model.  This is \"diminishing returns,\" where the value you get for the money becomes less and less the more you spend.\n\nAn example is electric guitars, where you can get a playable electric guitar for $200, but you'd have to spend more like $500 to get to the next tier of quality. Doubling that gets you a better guitar, but by that time you're spending 5 times the cost of the entry-level guitar.  The upgrades aren't necessarily worth their monetary value, but the upgraded product is definitely better than the base model.", "I've worked in spas and salons for years. Can confirm.", "Wild guess: She's younger and she's attractive. Those are her positive qualities and OP puts up with all the garbage because he feels he has to spoil her to keep her around. The end game is to stay with her until she's no longer hot or becomes so annoying that he needs to find a different young attractive woman to entice into a relationship with tons of gifts and fancy dinners.", "Amen! Louder for the people in the back!", "I got Gold digger vibes too as I was reading this..", "food may have been good a decade ago but that\u2019s a decade ago.\n\nfood on business class is mediocre at best and terrible most of the time.", "Honestly, I think it would've been better to fly economy for the first time, to temper expectations lol. Maybe a shorter flight though; 26 hours on a plane sucks no matter what class you fly in.", "Yeah who told this woman that flying was enjoyable? I thought we had all just accepted that suffering was part of traveling useless you\u2019re ultra rich.", "Sure does look like you stole a portion of the comment made by u/TravellingReallife hours ago \ud83d\ude21", "Imagine having to suffer through a 26 hour flight with someone so annoying, just because they're hot.", "110% this is the case. Malaysia is a very popular for expatriates to retire. The USD goes a long long way in Malaysia, and the cost of living is much cheaper.

Please OP, this woman sounds like a spoiled, energy vampiring brat and you are clearly a lovely human who deserves better.", "Yep. I was able to snag a \"premium economy\" (not even Business class) upgrade for my flight to New Zealand with my wife, and we had economy (but three seats to ourselves) on the way back. \n\nThe flight there was not comfortable really, but in comparison to the \"sky couch\" we had to sleep on for the flight back, it was the best thing ever. This was from two adults who have flown domestically multiple times before, so I can definitely see where she was coming from based on the price difference and a skewed frame of reference.", "Everything I've heard about Asian air line companies is how luxurious they are. I always mentally tack on for a plane and kind of assume that a lot of the amenities are only first class.

You have no ages, no details on the age gaps, NOTHING, yet to project a sexist narrative based on I don\u2019t know \u201cmen dumb and buy sex\u201d narrative. What exactly is this based on? Why are you being sexist out of nowhere?\n\nBonus points for implying 50% of the population is just dating for young attractive female spouses.\n\nYou literally managed to turn a post with no age information, no relationship dynamics, nothing into a \u201cOh *men*\u201d comment.

Do they look forward to spending time with her? Does she bring joy to him? \n\nIt could be that her complaining and negging is just a small part of their relationship and is just an annoyingly bad trait but not a dealbreaker.", "Seriously, you don't have to fly to Malaysia to find a partner who understands chronic illness.
