I would never leave my food in public or expect seats to be saved in a busy place like an airport. She\u2019s delusional.", "NTA. You don't leave a piece of food and assume nobody will take the seat. Of course it's going to look like trash somebody left. There is no chope culture in the airport. What she should have done was ask someone if they could watch their seat.", "NTA. You can't abandon an open yogurt in the middle of an airport and give it to your children more than 20 minutes later.", "It depends. Iranian yogurts are big no-no.

I\u2019m hoping this is her having tired mom brain because it\u2019s that weird. \n\n- Anything left unattended in a public space is fair game to a trip to the lost and found or (in this case being food) the trash. If she cared about this yogurt so much she wouldn\u2019t have purposely left it there. \n- Belongings aren\u2019t supposed to be left unattended in an airport regardless. \n- With how germy an airport and society in general is I don\u2019t know who in their right mind would leave food completely unattended and still want to eat it, let alone give it to a young child.\n\nEven if this is some special allergy friendly yogurt she needs to be prepared with other options for her kids/backup yogurt if her plan of keeping the kids full is this reliant on yogurt she PURPOSELY left on the seat lol", "Clearly the half eaten bagel on the chair meant I was returning", "NTA. You made the natural, logical conclusion that a left behind disposal item was abandoned trash. That mom hopefully learned a lesson about saving seats with trash, but it's doubtful given her reaction.", "NTA. Trust your wife.  \nWhat kind of a \\*$\\*$&% would leave food in a public spot as a \"placeholder\" and even more, what kind of a \\*$\\*$&% would give a child food that had been left open and unguarded in a public place? That's really scary.   \nIf she was so worried about keeping the kids \"full\" she could have easily picked up something at one of the many, many places available after clearing TSA.", "NTA.\n\nBut you should make it up to the mom by buying her children lots and lots of candy, so they won't be tired on the trip.", "Loose trash is not a seat-saver.

The correct response to the frazzled mom is \"here are your seats, sorry we threw your container.\" \n\n2.  I'm guessing the mom never had to clear up an abandoned 'spit cup' left in a public   \nplace.  \n\n3. The mom could have left a note on the seats saying \"I had to take my children to   \nthe restroom, we would like to sit here when we get back\".  But never trust that   \nopened  food or drink would be safe to consume.", "NTA\n\nThey were gone and you sat there for 15 or more minutes.  Sorry Mom, but you don't leave a half-eaten yogurt to show you are coming back.  I'd have thought it was trash as well.", "NTA. That mother is unfortunately an idiot. I feel bad for those kids.", "Lol NTA. What are you, a mind reader? And who the hell leaves a half-eaten yoghurt to indicate a seat is taken? Next time I'll just leave one M&M because obviously the conclusion is that I will come back and reclaim my seat. \n\nI love how people always claim others \"ruined their trip\" because they themselves messed up. Find a random half-eaten yoghurt in your seat - obviously toss it. She didn't notice for 20mins. Hardly your problem. Also, the kid will survive without that precious yoghurt. Or she can go buy another one.", "Exhausted parents, that's who."]}
