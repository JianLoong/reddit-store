He carried them in and out for me. Because he knows they're heavy, and knows I risk injuring myself trying to carry them myself. He did it willingly and carefully, because he knows how important my collection is and has encouraged the growth of it. He also has his own collection, although not as huge as mine (his primary collection is video games, which I'd argue made for just as heavy boxes transporting them as what my books did), which made him want to make sure to treat mine with care because he knows I treat his with the same treatment. That's the way to do things, not just go \"It's your junk, you take care of it\" because that just shows disrespect towards your partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to apologize to your girlfriend for not helping and for disparaging both her and her collection, and stop acting as though the books are these terrible things that you wish weren't in your home.", "If this is how you treat her, you're moving in together ..why????

Honestly this level of selfishness (sitting stubbornly in the car to prove a point while she lugged her possessions up the stairs alone) is a major red flag to me. In what other ways are you devaluing her? If you are unwilling to put value in the things she finds important, then maybe you should reassess your relationship. If I were speaking to her instead of you I would tell her to think long and hard about whether this is a one off, or just another thing in a string of selfish behaviours on your behalf. \n\nYou also mention her not \u201cbeing disabled\u201d.

If they had met later in life, sure. But he was an adult going for a minor.", "Nope", "European here. No it isn't.", "Stop the cap that\u2019s frowned upon in most countries", "Yea I\u2019m in Europe and this isn\u2019t normal.", "You've been together 8 years and you won't help her carry her things because you don't approve of... reading?", "That does NOT make it any better. Were you waiting for her to \"become legal\"? She's still a teenager for goodness sake get a grip on your life dude.", "Bold of you to assume there will still be an anniversary.", "So fucking gross. What is wrong with you?", "Waiting around until she was legal (but still a teenager) honestly does not make this any better.", "Gross, you sound like my ex that I started dating right after I turned 18, and he was 21. AH ended up r@ping me during a frat party. I didn't drink because I wanted to make sure I didn't get myself into a bad situation.  It didn't matter. He was drunk and decided my opinion or feelings didn't matter and took away my virginity that night. Said it was fine because we would get married, and then it wouldn't matter.  I wouldn't be surprised if you did the same to your girlfriend. Hopefully, she realizes what a horrible and uncaring person you are and dumps your nasty ass.", "This response...makes it worst", "I still can\u2019t comprehend how some people can be so oblivious, YTA", "Yta. You are mean spirited. Even friends would have helped each other let alone a boy friend who is supposed to love her. I\u2019m sure this is one of many examples of you showing you don\u2019t especially care for her. I hope she finally thinks \u2018I deserve better than this\u2019 and leaves.", "Your math doesn't add up \n\nIf your anniversary is next week then she was still 17, because you said her birthday was only a couple of weeks before you started dating, hence she just turned 26 \n\n26-9 = 17", "Not necessarily but it definitely is when one person is 21 and the other 17 lol", "Yeah that's a worry. God I hope she leaves him soon, imagine 8 years with this idiot", "No, come on, it's not always on the guys to do all the physical labour. This is the 21st century.\n\nBut refusing to help is an absolute AH move. And would have been equally AHish with reversed genders.", "He had his Pride and now has to deal with her Prejudice", "gaston would never pass up the opportunity to carry something", "Yes, I wish she did that , and then he would have realized that he is the a jerk for acting like a teenager.", "In one of his comments he claims they started dating ~a few weeks after she turned 18~ (yeah sure) so he must\u2019ve been 21 or 22.", "How is that creepy? She would have been 17 and he would have been 21", "If this is how OP treats someone they\u2019re supposed to have loved for 9 years, I\u2019m sure there are a thousand more glaring red flags that should\u2019ve been a cue to leave a long time ago. But hey, that\u2019s probably why he fished her out of fresh-out-of-high-school pond at 17, eh? Nothing for her to compare his shite behavior to I\u2019m sure.", "Wouldn't it just be fantastic if there's a hottie neighbour who offers to help her with the books?", "I'm fucking terrible at math, but that was the first thing that jumped out to me too.", "Fully developed brain are reached around 25+ years old. So people under 25 don\u2019t have fully developed brain that includes OP at the age he was dating her. So if both have undeveloped brain I suppose that\u2019s not a problem anymore, right? Or people should start dating from 25yo?", "Yes the brain stops developing at 25. BUT the ability to consent to relationships and contracts is developing and completing before 25. (A 16 y/o is able to consent in relationships (per law/acceptance in society), as a 18 y/o is able to consent in buying a house.) The ability to consent doesn\u2018t start at 25, it starts a lot earlier. Plus if a relationship is problematic or not is far more dependent on a predatory personality than a age cap. A 17 y/o can manipulate, like the 21 y/o.", "I'm sorry you went through that.", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.", "An idiot who calls books \u201cjunk\u201d lol", "True! Calling junk to books? Hoping she stops her \u201caddiction\u201d? What an asshole.", "Nooooo oooooone helps like Gaston\ncarries shelfs like Gaston\nTakes your book boxes up to the flat like Gaston!", "Only if he didn't know it was actually books in the boxes. \ud83e\udd23", "Let's be real here.  The reason why OP won't carry the boxes is because he can't.  He said it himself that it was too heavy to carry up the flight of stairs.  He is worse than Gaston.  And weak too.", "I started buying yarn \ud83d\ude06", "You know what they say when you assume right?", "Better yet a hottie who offers to help and also is a lover of books.", "He was much further along than her. The thing is, people should stay close to their age. Especially when they're still young. And we all know what a 21 old is after with a 17 (or barely 18) year old. It's very obvious from OP's post that he doesn't particularly care for her. \n\nYou know what 17 year olds also have less of? Experience. They don't really know yet what's ok in a relationship and what's a red flag, or potentially even dangerous. I was a 17 year old girl once too, and looking back, I'm horrified at the amount of adult men trying to prey on me, and on my peers. I've seen what happens.", "I agree it\u2019s fine in this specific case but a 16 year old with a 32 year old (as an extreme example) is never fine no matter what the law says. And arguing that it\u2019s even ok in countries where the law gives a lower age because those people are too dumb to know the age is low? That\u2019s the worst argument I\u2019ve ever heard. It makes no sense and actually made me laugh a little bit.", "It\u2019s hilarious that I get downvoted for a 6 year age gap. I wasn\u2019t a child and he wasn\u2019t my first boyfriend. I was finished high school and had been working for 6 months by that stage. Didn\u2019t get married until I was 20.", "I'd rather date a rock\n\n(I own over 500 books)", "\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nAlthough, Gaston would at least have carried the boxes without complaining about them being heavy because it\u2019s a \u2018manly man\u2019 thing", "Oh this is a good idea that I will use", "I laughed at this. Brilliant.", "I could hear this! Thank you!", "I have a way too large yarn stash \ud83e\udee0 haha", "I don\u2019t agree with extreme age gaps either. That is so icky.", "No one carries boxes of books like Gaston!", "Yeah, I heard his voice :)", "I went from living in my family's large 5 bedroom farm house to a tiny 1 bedroom apartment with my now husband... we don't currently have the room for my books and it sucks.", "That does suck!! I live in an apartment too so I know the storage struggle. I recently decluttered all my books so I only kept my favourites (it\u2019s still a way too big pile hah) but I took them into work and everyone there has been so thrilled to have a new library of books to enjoy. I get reviews often on who liked what so it\u2019s nice having a discussion about them \ud83d\ude04", "I currently work for Amazon, so doing that wouldn't go over either.", "How embarrassing!! I just commented to your earlier post going on about an Amazon account and Kindle Unlimited LOL"]}
