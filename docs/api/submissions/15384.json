He carried them in and out for me. Because he knows they're heavy, and knows I risk injuring myself trying to carry them myself. He did it willingly and carefully, because he knows how important my collection is and has encouraged the growth of it. He also has his own collection, although not as huge as mine (his primary collection is video games, which I'd argue made for just as heavy boxes transporting them as what my books did), which made him want to make sure to treat mine with care because he knows I treat his with the same treatment. That's the way to do things, not just go \"It's your junk, you take care of it\" because that just shows disrespect towards your partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to apologize to your girlfriend for not helping and for disparaging both her and her collection, and stop acting as though the books are these terrible things that you wish weren't in your home.", "If this is how you treat her, you're moving in together ..why????

Honestly this level of selfishness (sitting stubbornly in the car to prove a point while she lugged her possessions up the stairs alone) is a major red flag to me. In what other ways are you devaluing her? If you are unwilling to put value in the things she finds important, then maybe you should reassess your relationship. If I were speaking to her instead of you I would tell her to think long and hard about whether this is a one off, or just another thing in a string of selfish behaviours on your behalf. \n\nYou also mention her not \u201cbeing disabled\u201d.

I cut down on buying books\u2026 and started buying way too many dolls.", "I mean isn\u2019t he right? Reading books might make her smarter and who wants a smart woman?", "Well, as someone who used to own a ton of books but sadly has not been able to keep them over the years, they are way easier to take downstairs than this dipshit. Considering how dense he is.", "Gross can't believe I missed that.", "Yeah I was also here like wait she was 17 and he was old enough to legally drink when this started.", "Hope she gets you some books about what makes a relationship work for your last dating anniversary.", "Did you read your second paragraph before posting? YTA individually for each and every sentence in the second paragraph. Seven times the AH!", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry I waited until she was barely legal to date her it\u2019s not creepy at all!!\u201d\u201d\u201d", "Oh, so you were waiting for her to turn 18, now weren\u2019t you? Yeah, no worries, indeed!", "Still gross.", "if you guys don\u2019t break up that is!", "So you're a creep and a jerk. Congrats.", "Oh, how respectful of you to wait until she was legal. Totally not skeevy at all  /s", "\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e", "you groomed a minor, gross AF", "Did you know her before you officially started dating?", "Oh these few weeks make you so much less of a creep", "Then YTA. You couldn\u2019t be bothered to get off your ass to help carry boxes so she could move in with you. \n\nI hope your GF understands that she doesn\u2019t actually rank above laziness in your book, and moves right back out.", "She should dump you post haste", "So just like a mental disability", "Mentally disabled? Emotionally disabled?", "I was 17 and my partner was 22. So what? Been together 35 years. Married for 32. Don\u2019t see a problem with age gaps. Maturity gap on the other hand. She is much more mature than OP.", "Better still, one of those fancy ones that can \"climb stairs\". You can hire them from moving companies most of the time.", "apparently he waited until she was 18 according to him.", "Well now that he puts it this way\u2026 good looking out by OP not enabling his GF\u2019s literacy skills \ud83d\udc80", "In my last move,  packed and unpacked about 45 book boxes. Only about half were medical books.", "No. I have faced a similar issue with an ex. Used to feel left out if I read a book before bed.", "It's unfortunate she didn't bring the five boxes back down, then call her mom and say \"I'm sorry mom, you were right he is a selfish a-hole, can I come home.\"  No way this is the first time he's behaved this way and he's only going to get worse when they're under the same roof.", "Haha, even Gaston would have carried the books though!", "Yep, I stopped buying as many books a few years ago, and then I started buying plants. Now I have an addiction to both\u2026", "Omg this cracked me up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "I know this guy is a real piece of work.", "OP\u2019s thoughts were once she\u2019s 18 she can legally carry her own boxes", "That what I said as long as it legal you are fine , even if I don't like when the legal age go under 14 thankfully most people that live in those country doesn't know it's 14 and think it's more", "\u201cIt\u2019s not right for a woman to read! Soon she starts getting *ideas* and *thinking*!\u201d\n\nYTA, Gaston", "Wow, that's a impressive! I don't have so many, but what helped me last time I moved, was packing them in suitcases. It was easier to pack and to move them", "Yeah, ten boxes is...not really a lot. A lot to have to carry at once, and a *ton* when you know you have an able-bodied person who is purportedly your partner who's just sitting there smugly with his feet up, but I think my husband and I had something like thirty or forty when we moved, and that's \\*after\\* I lost most of the books I owned in an Evil Landlord Event.", "I had four of those big Tub style containers of books when I last moved. They were so heavy. My friends/fam still helped me move them. Deciding how to arrange my books on my bookshelves was so satisfying. By category and comics and ones at the front I have next in line to read. It's so fun.", "lmao - i was gonna say 10 boxes is nothing to frame this as some kind of addictive / hoarding behavior. \n\nI bet he expects her to just confirm to his lifestyle so any material sign of her existence is crap in the way of his living space - but how nice he's letting her move in after 9 years!", "OMG you're right! This guy is actually a Disney villain!", "Literally the only thing I could think of as I read this entire post lol", "Gaston would have at least carried the boxes", "Yes, I'm a proud bookwhore. I love them and will never give them up. If a romantic interest ever spoke to me this way about my books, those would be the last words he ever said to me.", "Yes, whenever I moved between college and home, the best books got the suitcases, the rest of the books got plastic bins, the clothes got garbage bags.", "And you know what? Gaston might be a villain, but he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to carry some boxes up the stairs. This guy is possibly worse!"]}
