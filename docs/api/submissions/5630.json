I bought (paid for myself) the ingredients last time we went grocery shopping.  \n\nSo yesterday I made 3 pizzas. So we each had toppings we like and there'd be leftovers.  \n\nI admit I didn't make the dough for the crust,  but the stuff I bought was more expensive/higher quality of the premade options and it still needed to be rolled out and everything.\n\nSo I made the pizzas,  my mom made a salad and some garlic bread.  \n\nMy aunt came over and we had dinner.  My aunt was taking her pieces of pizza and scraping the toppings off and eating it.  I asked what she was doing and she said she seen crustless pizza advertised and wanted to try it. I asked what she was going to do with the crust and she said \"throw it out probably,  unless one of you guys wants it\". My mom and I didn't.  So she threw it out. \n\nI was kinda annoyed and said \"I wouldn't  have wasted time making your crust and would have just heated up sauce cheese and your toppings for you if I'd known you were  going to throw it out\". \n\nShe said \"no, this is better that would have been like soup, this way I don't get full as fast\". \n\nMy mom said \"some people eat things there own way\". \n\nI said \"yea, but it's nice to know before making it for them\". \n\nMy aunt said \"well I don't normally eat pizza like this, but I wanted to try it. It's good and I can eat more this way\". \n\nI just said whatever and tried to ignore it.   But I was annoyed the rest of the time she was here. \n\nWhen my aunt left I told my mom I'm never cooking for her again because I wasted time and money on her crust just for her to throw it out. \n\nMy mom said \"you can't make people eat things the way you want them to just because you cooked it, some people just eat things differently. Nothing to get mad over \".\n\nI said \"but she doesn't do that normally,  she just randomly decided to \"try it\". I'm not wasting my time and money on someone that does that besides it was kinda rude\". \n\nMy mom said I was being weird and to get over it. \n\nI'm not mad anymore,  but I know there will be a time in the future that I'm asked to cook.

It would be one thing if it was one slice or so, but saying she can eat more this way implies she ate a fair amount of slices. And probably threw out a whole pizza\u2019s worth of crust. Even though pizza dough is cheap to make, that doesn\u2019t justify her actions. I think completely refusing to make her stuff might be a bit far but you should make it very clear it\u2019s one thing to eat things her own way. It\u2019s another to throw out something you worked hard on AND THEN TAKE MORE", "NTA. Though I suggest you take the middle ground . Next time your aunt visits, just go buy some frozen pizza and don't waste any effort/money on better ingredients. You'll still be contributing.", "NTA what a waste, esp that you made it yourself. Not just a waste of food but money and effort and lack of appreciation too.  I once made these desserts that were like frosting on top of graham crackers for a party, a girl ate basically all of them by scraping the frosting off and throwing the graham crackers away. I still think about it lol.", "NTA What she did was rude and thoughtless. She shouldn't be doing that with food someone else put effort into making. Taking more slices of pizza to make up for the fact that her \"crustless\" pizza was less filling was rude too.\n\nI'd tell your mother that you won't be spending any of your own money or making any special efforts for your aunt when she comes over for dinner for a while. If behavior like that becomes the norm for her it may be permanent.\n\nTell your mother that surely the lesson she'd like you take away from the experience is how it feels when people thoughtlessly waste the food you pay for and put effort into cooking, so you don't do it to others, not that you should accept it as normal behavior.", "NTA.  Completely agree that yes, people do eat differently, but she could've done it on her own dime.  That was really rude of her.", "NTA. That's kind of rude to do when you are a guest at someone else's house and someone wasted their time cooking for you. If your mother is fine with it she can make her food and see it go to waste.", "NTA - Your aunt was rude to throw out food that you paid for and made for her.", "NTA.  Your aunt was basically throwing away your hard earned money by only eating the toppings.  It's behaviour I'd expect to see in a very small child not a grown-ass woman.", "NTA she meant that she could waste it and only eat the best bits because she didn't pay for it. Its wasteful and gross tbh.", "I'm saying NTA because the food waste????", "NTA.  If she wanted to try a new wasteful way of eating pizza, she should have done it with one she bought or made herself.  That was bad behavior and I don't blame you for not wanting to cook for her again.", "Is your aunt perhaps on a diet?  And maybe does not want to share that with everyone just yet?  Did she eat the garlic bread?\n  \n  \nI ask because when I did keto, this is how I would eat pizza if it was the only thing available.  People tend to shit on you for dieting so I would sometimes say I just preferred it like that rather than go into a whole thing about dieting.", "NTA", "NAH. \n\n>My mom said I was being weird and to get over it. \n\nMom is right.  Actually your aunt is weird too. Drop it.", "If your aunt so desperately wanted to try it, why couldn't she have wasted her own money on her own food in her own home instead of wasting yours?!", "ESH. Your aunt for not letting you know of a change in her dietary preferences, and you for being a grouchy host. Let people enjoy their food how they want to.", "YTA.  you're talking about this crust like you saved it from a crackhouse and raised it as your own until the age of 18.  your aunt didn't see you roll out the crust on your own, or whatever makes you think it's extra important special crust so she has no idea it means this much to you since you paid an extra $1.50 for it and all.\n\never eaten a cake with too much icing, and scraped some of the icing off?  did anyone get mad at you for it?", "YTA.\n\nYour mom is right. Sure, food waste is a frustrating. But it was just her trying something out. You are being weirdly controlling and taking this too personally", "Yep. Sorry.  You're young but YTA. Your mom is right, and you don't get to dictate how other people eat", "You don't have to cook for anyone for any reason. But YTA for judging how people eat. Don't question their eating habits; accept what they are saying.\n\nYou're not the food police.", "NAH \n\nMountains out of molehills.  I promise you there will be real things to be upset about over the course of your life.  This won't even make the list.  Just don't make pizza again if it bothers you.", "YTA\nYou can\u2019t control how people eat.  Sorry you spent more money then usual on this dish.  Did YOU enjoy it?  Regardless, you learned a lesson.  Don\u2019t buy more expensive ingredients if this aunt is eating with you.  Then it won\u2019t matter as much.", "YWBTA - you know how many pizza chefs have to watch piles of their lovingly mixed and fermented batches of pizza dough go in the garbage because people just want to stuff themselves with the toppings portion and not eat the crust? She probably didn't like your dough and was being polite about it in an awkward way, get over yourself!", "NTA.  It's rude to eat like your aunt did.  If she can't eat crust, she should let you know so you can make her something different.  You shouldn't have to watch her murder your hard work.", "Nta", "It\u2019s not about people eating how they want or about you wasting a inconsequential insignificant amount of money that went into the crust. It\u2019s about your aunt being a disgusting fucking slob doing something that can be expected from a 5 year old.\n\nFood preferences are not the same as ripping apart food, eating bits messy bits of it, and leaving a mess behind.  That\u2019s gross and childish.", "NTA , I bet she would not have done it if the cook had been an adult , like a coworker .", "YTA.  She ate your food, just not the crust.  There are many reasons I have seen people scrape the toppings off and just eat those.  My husband did it for a long time because he was following a low carb diet.  When you are younger, it feels like a really big deal to spend your own money to cook for your family.  I understand being frustrated because you feel like it was wasted money.  In the scope of things, it's really not that much money for the portion she ate.  People have different preferences, and she still ate what you offered.  Just not the way you wanted her to.  She enjoyed your food from the sounds of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Serving grilled vegetables with melted cheese is not the same. it was a nice thing you did cooking for others, but you can\u2019t control how your cooking is received; what you can do is decide not to make pizza for her again (or, if you do, to provide a very cheap base).", "NTA..\nBut I rarely eat the crust.", "NTA, but your aunt is very rude, lacks basic manners, and has a quite weird relationship with food.
