Asking to meet them to understand their needs is a basic ask. If he\u2019s wealthy, can afford it, and won\u2019t fly them out I\u2019d be extremely concerned.

Getting anybody a green card is a process that takes a year and runs about $2000.  That's assuming that your husband is a US citizen.  If not, well, it's harder.\n\nBut he's over there, and you're over here, and you can tell him to behave or you won't have anything to do with him.  Make sure that your husband stands with you.", "Nta\n\nIf he's wealthy why would he have a problem immigrating on his own?", "NTA- Your father in-law is not entitled to a green card from you and your husband simply because he thinks he deserves it. It is a lengthy and extensive process that requires proof and demonstration of various things. Him not being willing to bring the family over to meet is odd, as that is a very small thing to ask for, all things considered. If he is wealthy as described, doing this to obtain the life he wants shouldn\u2019t be that difficult.", "NTA - Has his Da actually looked at that process for himself? It\u2019s a long, drawn out, expensive process. He can\u2019t just expect you guys to do it for him, and no offence here but he sounds like the type of FIL i wouldn\u2019t want living anywhere near me!!", "NTA, we have enough AHs in the US already.

One being living in the States. Two he will need to hire a lawyer.

Have you looked at the green card process?  It's really long and quite expensive.", "I\u2019m curious about the supposed wealth.  With international sanctions against Russia, he might not be as wealthy as he claims anymore.  And even if he is, getting money out ain\u2019t easy because of banking sanctions.  Unless, of course, you can launder through established American accounts like a family members.  And he\u2019s not the one facing jail time for wire fraud and money laundering if caught.  The account owner will be for sure.  \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for refusing to join that circus.  A friend recently went through it all with his wife (and this was before the attack on Ukraine).  Took a couple years and an immigration lawyer and a lot of headaches before she could get residency.  And that was after the marriage (not mail order - they had met while she was on a student visa).  There\u2019s also a lot of responsibility on behalf of the sponsor.  I would suggest an hour consultation with an immigration lawyer to learn what you would have to do and be responsible for and then you can make an informed decision.", "Umm...

I'm not sure how you are meant to figure this out (or if he even has a right to citizenship... ???)", "Have you told your husband to handle his family?", "Info: what does your husband say? Is he a US citizen?", "Do not bring these people over. Ever wonder why they want it so bad?

But you do not have a family relationship with him that matters for immigration law purposes. \n2) Assuming your husband is a citizen and filed for his father, his petition would NOT include FILs minor children. Realistically, your FIL would need to go through a long process to get his green card, enter the United States without his kids, and then FIL would file petitions for his children.\n3) Your husband would absolutely need to sign an affidavit of support guaranteeing that he will provide for your FIL. That obligation ends after 10 years, if FIL accumulates enough years of work, or if FIL becomes a citizen.\n4) If FIL files petitions for his children, he would then need to file his own affidavit of support demonstrating that he can support his kids. If he can't do that, he would need a joint sponsor. \n\nNTA. But also, stop saying that you'll consider it if he comes to visit, because it sounds like your mind is made up, and visiting the US can actually become much more difficult if you have family members who could file a petition for you.", "NTA tell him to stay in Putin land and shove it up his you know where", "If he is in Russia and Belarus  mostly then is he Ukrainian? Because both those countries are at war or supporting the war with Ukraine. Would he even get in to the US based on that alone ??", "NTA... No need to reward belligerence no matter where they are coming from. AHs are AHs", "NTA - honestly he sounds like bad news. You don\u2019t really do much in sponsoring him - that\u2019s up to your husband as he can sponsor his parents assuming he is a citizen.\n\nI would  refuse to have anything to do with it.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for Russians to get to the U.S. because they have to get a visa to a country where they can do an interview.", "NTA - I mean, Ukrainian with businesses in Russia and Belarus... the shitstorm and stress from just putting those 3 words in the same sentence, and family, and probably so much other shit.  I wouldn't touch the Greencard thing and have your name tied to some hot potato until you knew exactly what you were getting yourself into, and with who.\n\nSeems over the top reaction, and is your husband so spineless to let his dad treat you both like dogshit??  That's not a good sign of things to come... I know you don't marry the family, you marry \"into\" it, so sorta stuck with them, but if they are having a severe impact on your mental health and your husband ain't doing shit about it... it does not bode well, at all.", "NTA\nI'd seriously consider calling it quits with my husband if his father was that boldfaced. Does your FIL believe that you owe it to him to get him a green card? Those things take a lot of time, does he know and understand that? Does your husband understand that? Why doesn't he explain it to his hard headed father? Discussion is needed before anything can even be started and if he doesn't want to do that, he doesn't want it, simple.", "NTA..and why the hell would anyone want to live here.

I agree and will probably block them from contacting us for a while. He has never been decent towards me now that I think of it", "I\u2019d also add that FIL would typically have to interview at the American Embassy in the country of his passport, which is the Ukraine, and it does not seem like he intends to return back to the Ukraine any time soon. \n\nAs an alternative to applying for the green card, which many have pointed out can take years to get approved since FIL is not a minor child of, or the spouse of a U.S. Citizen/green card holder, Ukrainians can temporarily stay in the U.S. for two years according to the link below, but it is unlikely that OP would get FIL to travel to U.S. prior to starting this immigration process in order for her to meet his family in person. \n\nI agree that OP\u2019s husband, who is a U.S. citizen and immediate relative of FIL can agree to sponsor either for the temporary visa (2 years) or green card (10 years) if he wishes to, and should also help facilitate getting an immigration attorney and also have them find out which embassy FIL can interview at since FIL won\u2019t be returning to the Ukraine any time soon. \n\nAgreeing to be a financial sponsor (which is different from petitioning for an eligible relative to get a green card) means that OP\u2019s husband has enough income on his own to financially care for FIL and his family if needed, and that the U.S. government has recourse to sue OP\u2019s husband if FIL (or his family) gets any government assistance for the next 10 years (or 2 years if they do the temp visa). If FIL has the funds, he should cover the costs of all of the filing fees, government documents, medical exams, police reports, affidavits, photos, courier fees, attorneys fees etc. FIL will have to do the heavy lifting of getting the necessary documentation ready to submit with his application. \n\nFIL should also consider immigrating to Canada if he is adamant about leaving Europe sooner. \n\nOP has no standing to petition for FIL or his family for a green card because she is not an eligible relative, but she could be a financial sponsor. \n\nImmigration law can be complex and so that is why it would be best for a competent attorney (preferably Russian-speaking) to consult with FIL instead of OP saying generally that the process can be started once OP meets FIL and the family. \n\nhttps://www.uscis.gov/ukraine", "As a Ukrainian myself I can understand the desperation to get the F out of Russia\u2026 but if he is already free to travel between Russia and Italy and has money I don\u2019t understand why he needs the green card for the US specifically when moving the family to another part of Western Europe would be easier and fundamentally a better quality of life than the US\u2026 something is not right here. I would totally support you in separating from your husband if he can\u2019t keep his family\u2019s ridiculous demands in check. This is just sketchy as shit.", "He may be Ukranian, but he lives in Belarus and Russia. Makes me wonder if he's more of a Ukranian or more pro-Russia. The behavior is cause for concern.
