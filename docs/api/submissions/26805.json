Asking to meet them to understand their needs is a basic ask. If he\u2019s wealthy, can afford it, and won\u2019t fly them out I\u2019d be extremely concerned. His stonewalling is really out of character for someone who genuinely wants to come to the states. \n\nThis feels odd and off. Protect yourself OP.", "If he\u2019s toxic from halfway across the world, imagine what they\u2019d be like if they moved closer to you.", "NTA. \u201cHe\u2019s a wealthy business owner in Belarus and Russia\u201d. Not to stereotype him, but I have a feeling he\u2019s used to getting what he wants when he wants it. He thinks he can get a green card by yelling and abusing you. \n\nFrom my point of view, this is your husband\u2019s problem. If he wants his dad to get a green card, let him deal with it. I would prefer this rude, entitled man to stay far, far away.", "NTA. I don't think you want to be legally tied to someone that aggressive who treats you badly and won't agree to the most basic requirement of meeting the family members.", "NTA, but you FIL certainly is, and a dumbass too, for thinking that the corruption he's used to exists in the US as well.  Getting anybody a green card is a process that takes a year and runs about $2000.  That's assuming that your husband is a US citizen.  If not, well, it's harder.\n\nBut he's over there, and you're over here, and you can tell him to behave or you won't have anything to do with him.  Make sure that your husband stands with you.", "Nta\n\nIf he's wealthy why would he have a problem immigrating on his own?", "NTA- Your father in-law is not entitled to a green card from you and your husband simply because he thinks he deserves it. It is a lengthy and extensive process that requires proof and demonstration of various things. Him not being willing to bring the family over to meet is odd, as that is a very small thing to ask for, all things considered. If he is wealthy as described, doing this to obtain the life he wants shouldn\u2019t be that difficult.", "NTA - Has his Da actually looked at that process for himself? It\u2019s a long, drawn out, expensive process. He can\u2019t just expect you guys to do it for him, and no offence here but he sounds like the type of FIL i wouldn\u2019t want living anywhere near me!!", "NTA, we have enough AHs in the US already.  Maybe send a few to Russia.", "NTA,\n\nYour husband needs to sack up and tell his Dad to chill out.", "Info: how does your husband respond when Daddy throws a tantrum?", "NTA, the guy needs to stay where he is.", "NTA... seriously, don't give in, because if Ukrainian is living part-time in Russia and he is \"wealthy business owner in Belarus and Russia\", that's very suspicious (bad people thrive in those countries) and not really someone I would want to have anything to do, especially with how he demands you do things for him... what will he want after that?", "NTA \n\nUmm they are requirements to obtain a green card in the US. One being living in the States. Two he will need to hire a lawyer. They don\u2019t hand these out like candy nor it\u2019s entirely up to you.", "I have blocked them on all communications unless they agree to meet up in person and this is also why he's so mad", "NTA.  Have you looked at the green card process?  It's really long and quite expensive.", "I\u2019m curious about the supposed wealth.  With international sanctions against Russia, he might not be as wealthy as he claims anymore.  And even if he is, getting money out ain\u2019t easy because of banking sanctions.  Unless, of course, you can launder through established American accounts like a family members.  And he\u2019s not the one facing jail time for wire fraud and money laundering if caught.  The account owner will be for sure.  \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for refusing to join that circus.  A friend recently went through it all with his wife (and this was before the attack on Ukraine).  Took a couple years and an immigration lawyer and a lot of headaches before she could get residency.  And that was after the marriage (not mail order - they had met while she was on a student visa).  There\u2019s also a lot of responsibility on behalf of the sponsor.  I would suggest an hour consultation with an immigration lawyer to learn what you would have to do and be responsible for and then you can make an informed decision.", "Umm... NTA but I also don't think this is the right forum.\n\nTell him to get a lawyer, and you will comply with any requests for documents. I'm not sure how you are meant to figure this out (or if he even has a right to citizenship... ???)", "Have you told your husband to handle his family?", "Info: what does your husband say? Is he a US citizen?", "Do not bring these people over. Ever wonder why they want it so bad? If they want citizenship, they can try through proper channels.", "Okay, so just a few points about immigration law:\n\n1) You cannot file a petition for your FIL even if you wanted to - your husband could, assuming he is a US citizen. But you do not have a family relationship with him that matters for immigration law purposes. \n2) Assuming your husband is a citizen and filed for his father, his petition would NOT include FILs minor children. Realistically, your FIL would need to go through a long process to get his green card, enter the United States without his kids, and then FIL would file petitions for his children.\n3) Your husband would absolutely need to sign an affidavit of support guaranteeing that he will provide for your FIL. That obligation ends after 10 years, if FIL accumulates enough years of work, or if FIL becomes a citizen.\n4) If FIL files petitions for his children, he would then need to file his own affidavit of support demonstrating that he can support his kids. If he can't do that, he would need a joint sponsor. \n\nNTA. But also, stop saying that you'll consider it if he comes to visit, because it sounds like your mind is made up, and visiting the US can actually become much more difficult if you have family members who could file a petition for you.", "NTA tell him to stay in Putin land and shove it up his you know where", "If he is in Russia and Belarus  mostly then is he Ukrainian? Because both those countries are at war or supporting the war with Ukraine. Would he even get in to the US based on that alone ??", "NTA... No need to reward belligerence no matter where they are coming from. AHs are AHs", "NTA - honestly he sounds like bad news. You don\u2019t really do much in sponsoring him - that\u2019s up to your husband as he can sponsor his parents assuming he is a citizen.\n\nI would  refuse to have anything to do with it.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for Russians to get to the U.S. because they have to get a visa to a country where they can do an interview.", "NTA - I mean, Ukrainian with businesses in Russia and Belarus... the shitstorm and stress from just putting those 3 words in the same sentence, and family, and probably so much other shit.  I wouldn't touch the Greencard thing and have your name tied to some hot potato until you knew exactly what you were getting yourself into, and with who.\n\nSeems over the top reaction, and is your husband so spineless to let his dad treat you both like dogshit??  That's not a good sign of things to come... I know you don't marry the family, you marry \"into\" it, so sorta stuck with them, but if they are having a severe impact on your mental health and your husband ain't doing shit about it... it does not bode well, at all.", "NTA\nI'd seriously consider calling it quits with my husband if his father was that boldfaced. Does your FIL believe that you owe it to him to get him a green card? Those things take a lot of time, does he know and understand that? Does your husband understand that? Why doesn't he explain it to his hard headed father? Discussion is needed before anything can even be started and if he doesn't want to do that, he doesn't want it, simple.", "NTA..and why the hell would anyone want to live here.  If I had the money, I\u2019d be getting the hell out!", "NTA.  If he wants citizenship so bad, he can start the ball rolling himself.  Does he think you can just snap your fingers and suddenly all the paperwork, red rape, and work will be squared away?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
