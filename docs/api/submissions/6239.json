This lunch was planned well in advance and so was the menu.\n\nImportant background info is that I recently had a surgery, that prohibits me from eating specific foods. My mum knows this, and we even visited the doctor and got advice on what we could make for me to eat instead. We agreed on what we were going to make, and that was it (or so I thought).\n\nYesterday, I was preparing dinner, and my mum asked what I was having tomorrow, and I reminded her of what we had agreed. She replied that she can't make that food only for me specifically, she'd have to make enough for everyone, which would be too much effort, and unnecessary since we were already having 5 other main dishes. I reminded her that I cannot eat any of the dishes so it ISN'T unnecessary, and that we could just make enough for me (realistically it would take 15-20 minutes to make a single serving and we already had all the ingredients on hand, we just had to thaw them).\n\nI reminded her our \"guests\" were literally my brothers, grandpa and my brother's in-laws which are literally family. I offered to make them myself but she dismissed me, said she was going to \"figure it out\", and left the room.\n\nToday, I was in the kitchen making breakfast, when she comes in and asked me what I was going to have for lunch. I looked at her, and asked what she was talking about. She said that she hadn't prepared anything that I can have, nor did she thaw out any chicken or fish for me. I'm really struggling with food right now (and not being able to eat any of my favourite foods), and having all those smells in the kitchen, knowing I had nothing to eat for our new year family lunch (it's a yearly tradition) really triggered me. I started crying and left the room, and she just rolled her eyes at me.\n\nMy brother and SIL tried to console me, and we tried to look for places we could order some take out, but nothing was open. I ended up boiling two eggs, and tried to sit at the table while everyone was eating. My grandfather (didn't know about the situation), and asked me \"Why are you just eating eggs? That's not a proper lunch for new years!\". That triggered me again, and I replied that I didn't want to just eat eggs, but my mum didn't care enough to make sure I had something I could eat. Apparently 20 minutes of effort were too much, but going to 4 different supermarkets to find a specific brand of ingredient was not.\n\nWhen they left, I asked my mum why she didn't prepare something for me, or at least let me know so I could prepare something for myself. She just went off on me saying that I embarrassed her in front our in laws, and that I should be ashamed for making people think that she's a bad mother.\n\nMy brothers, SIL and my friends are all on my side, but now she's crying and saying I ruined new year's for her, and I can't help but feel guilty.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672602541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100rnip/aita_for_making_a_scene_on_new_years/", "score": 281, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Considering she had so much to cook for a special occasion, and you are not convalescing, you are old enough to prepare your own food. You have it even if there was no special occasion.\nEnglish isn\u2019t my native language, though.", "You knew the day before, why didn't YOU get something out to defrost?", "Thank you for clarifying! I was afraid I explained it badly and confused people! But yes!", "YTA. Mom was making 5 courses, there was no space in the kitchen for OP to do her own thing. She should have ordered in or picked up food in advance.", "Morning of mom says she did not make anything for them. OP could have made something(there are hours between lunch and breakfast) but decided to just boil eggs. Because mommy should have made something for them?", ">Yesterday, I was preparing dinner, and my mum asked what I was having tomorrow, and I reminded her of what we had agreed. She replied that she can't make that food only for me specifically, she'd have to make enough for everyone, which would be too much effort\n\n\nShe told you point blank that she was not making stuffed grape leaves just for you and you did nothing.", "No. The night before you were told:\n\n>She replied that she can't make that food only for me specifically, she'd have to make enough for everyone, which would be too much effort.\n\nYou ignored her and insisted that she could make it just for you. You ignore her NO. She said no. You argued and would not drop it,  she said she would figure something out to get you out of her face. Bad communication on her part, but Y are still TA.", ":( sorry this happened to you. NTA and maybe make your own food from now on. It\u2019ll be better for you to gain a little independence from your mum and not have her hold anything over you", "There are so many other dishes that could have worked out for *everyone*. That spread almost seems like it was made to *not* accommodate you. It's nothing but fried fat aside from maybe the chicken. Why?\n\nNTA - Breaking the agreement was shitty. Knowing your dietary needs and serving that is like a slap on the face. But the end result is backstabbing. It would have taken NO time or effort at all to just also have a salad or something. Then at least you would have had something other than a few boiled eggs. \n\nOn another note, bit off topic, holy shit, yall need some sides. Making *all* entrees is, as a guest, disappointing. Sides are also an easy way to give guest variety. Roast some brussel sprouts, whole potatoes with some self serve toppings, at least one soup, sauteed mushrooms with some wine. These things are easy to add on to any dinner party because you don't really need to pay them much mind while cooking your main dish(s). The salad you could even do the night before.", "Thank you!", "Thank you! I honestly hope we can have a civil conversation when things have calmed down!", "Thank you for this comment! It's been really hard trying to adjust with these restrictions.\n\nI don't mind cooking for her, I love cooking, but I just hate that this had to happen on new years.", "I literally had the same thought (about internalised misogyny)! \n\nThank you!", "I think you misunderstood me. It was agreed upon earlier (at the doctor's office), that she would make a specific dish I could have. Then, the night before the lunch, our conversation ended with her saying she would make me a meal I could have. The morning of the lunch (2 hours before the guests would arrive), she told me she had nothing prepared and nothing I could cook with (everything was frozen/not thawed). If there were ingredients I could use to make something I would, but there weren't any.", "She told me she was going to do it? I explain in my post that she told me that she'd make something in our \"night before\" conversation.", "Nothing was available. I tried ordering in, but where I live most places are closed new years day.\n\nI would've picked up food in advance had I known. I was literally told 2 hours prior to our family members arriving. As I said above, I offered to make food for myself.", "2 hours. Should've made that clearer in the post. 2 hours between when the conversation happened and people arriving.", "you keep replying this but like I said, she literally said she'd take care of it before ending the conversation!", "Are you adding details to corroborate your point of view? \n\nI said I could make it myself. She said no, because SHE would figure it out. \n\nLike I said, SHE said she was going to make something, and INSISTED I didn't have to. \n\nI was not insisting on anything, other than having a meal at the table.", "Thanks, I usually do! I cook for both of us almost daily. Today was an exception because I was told there was going to be something I could have!", "That's what upsets me the most!\n\nThis could've been avoided so easily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, yes I agree! I guess the rice and potatoes can count as sides?", "That is always hard to achieve. There's a book about being the child in a relationship (I forget the name) but often the actual children need to be the \"adult\" person and bridge the gap. I personally struggle with this because I get very emotional when confronting my parents about things I disagree with, but some people handle it better.\n\nThe idea is to hold a calm and reasoned conversation about the emotions, the difficulties and the reasons things fell down. And then work on understanding one another and trying to prevent it happening again. Upshot is sometimes even though you're the daughter, you need to be the adult and take charge if you want peace", "Now I understand. Thanks a lot for explaining.", "No...this conversation was continued from the night before. \n\nOP said:\n\n>Yesterday, I was preparing dinner, and my mum asked what I was having tomorrow, and I reminded her of what we had agreed. She replied that she can't make that food only for me specifically, she'd have to make enough for everyone, which would be too much effort\n\n\nRight there OPs mom flat out said she was not going to make stuffed grape leaves just for OP.", "> Also, yes I agree! I guess the rice and potatoes can count as sides?\n\nYea, but, you have 4 entrees and only two sides?\n\nI do a lot of dinner parties myself. I've cooked professionally since 2009. You're making it harder on yourself than it needs to be. How many guest did you have? Lets assume 20. Personally I'd do 2 entrees max. Everything else sides, salads and soup. Soup and salad are easy prep in advance items. You can buy gluten free stocks pre-made [and fix them up pretty easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whtbrb_--Hc). For you I'd take some veggies, whatever you like (broccoli, yellow onion, carrot, celery, squash, tomatoes are good options) salt pepper them (whatever oil you can have, if any. If none thats fine too) roast them in the oven the night before. Take them out, throw them in stock, blend, chill, reheat the day of. All the actual cooking was done day before, so you can focus on your main dish(s). Salad is the same. Get a bag or two of spring-mix, chop some veg you'd like (broccoli, carrot, celery, red onion) and some other toppings like bacon, croutons and cheese, buy a (or a few) pre-made dressings. Store in fridge separately and bring back out the day of. All you have to do is take them out or reheat in the case of the soup. \n\nAnd the best part is, most of this stuff can be apart of other things. Like the bacon and cheese for the salad can also go with the baked potato and soup. So you can buy bulk which saves money. And, imo, it seems like you're offering SOOO much more. If you really get into it start buying whole chickens (also saves money typically) and use the bones to make your own stock from scratch. You can freeze it no problem.\n\nOh, and another benefit, because you didn't just have a bunch of fat, people will probably feel better after they eat and will remember the party more fondly. I hate leaving a dinner party and feeling like shit because of the food.", "I've been in therapy for a long time, trying to learn how to communicate with her, since she's not a great communicator. Thank you for your suggestions.", ">4games\n\nyou are taking this out of context. If you continue reading, I said that:\n\n\"and unnecessary since we were already having 5 other main dishes. I reminded her that I cannot eat any of the dishes so it ISN'T unnecessary, and that we could just make enough for me (realistically it would take 15-20 minutes to make a single serving and we already had all the ingredients on hand, we just had to thaw them).  \nI reminded her our \"guests\" were literally my brothers, grandpa and my brother's in-laws which are literally family. I offered to make them myself but she dismissed me, said she was going to \"figure it out\", and left the room.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you actually finished reading - she said **she** was going to **\"figure it out\",** and left the room.\n\nShe didn't say YOU figure it out.
