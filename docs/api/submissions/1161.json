{"id": 1161, "submission_id": "ym0u9d", "title": "AITA for telling my sister about her boyfriend mistreating her dog?", "selftext": "I will try to summarize this as compactly as I can... but it will unavoidably be long.\n\nI had been renting with my sister for a month and a half while in between places (getting ready to move across country again for school). She had offered that I stay with them and pay a little bit each month (like 200 bucks) to help with the mortgage. So herself and her boyfriend of 2 ish years and I were sharing the same living space. Her boyfriend has anger issues (not ad-hominem. He is aware, reluctantly acknowledges it, and has tried therapy etc.) and he rarely speaks to me. We have gotten along but he ignores me in conversations with others, does not engage when I try to chit chat and so on. My sister and I are very close siblings and get along very well, always have. We have never had a fight like this.\n\nThey have two dogs- his, which is about 4 years old, and their new puppy who is less than a year old. His dog is very nervous, will not let people pet her, cries and whimpers constantly and is otherwise a depressed dog. Family and friends know this as well. I am really not a dog person, not fond of them at all, would say I dislike them personally. Not my thing. But I often dog-sit for my sister when she is working or otherwise needs me to watch them (which is usually once a day for an hour minimum, 6 hours max on some days).  I've come to be somewhat fond of them. \n\n \nLast week I was sitting on the couch in our living room early in the morning quietly having a cup of tea and reading a book. They were both sleeping, but he had come out to let the puppy outside. They crate train her at night and let her out in the morning when they wake up. Sometimes when they sleep later, they will let her out in the A.M and put her back in for a while so they can sleep in.\n\nAs he brought the pup in by her collar, he walked towards the crate and dragged her forcefully (think, rolling a heavy bowling ball with EXTREME force) across the floor about 6 or 7 feet, and slammed her little body into a book case, all silently, and then proceeded to put her in the cage in the same manner.\n\nI quickly realized he did not see me there. The way the living room is configured makes it tough to see if someone is on the couch. Shocked by what I had seen (blatant, explicit, intentional animal ab*se), I exclaimed perfunctorily \"what the f***???\". He looked at me, clearly caught off guard, said nothing and walked back to their room. As he walked away, still shocked, I said \"That was highly uncalled for.\" To which he still did not reply.\n\nAt this point, my whole body was trembling, I felt like I was in fight or flight mode. My face was flushed because my blood pressure was so high, I felt hot. Not knowing how to proceed, I immediately texted my mother and told her what happened and asked what I should do. She said I should tell my sister when she woke. My sister was sleeping still through all of this. I couldn't sit for any amount of time with this, so I texted her and told her what happened. \n\nLet me reiterate - this was clearly deliberate. The dog was quiet, behaved, and this had not been warranted in the slightest way. He grabbed that dog, dragged her hard and slammed her little innocent body into that bookcase for some sadistic gratification. I will never unsee it. It was by far, and I've seen some horrid things, the most horrifying thing I have witnessed to date. \n\nMy sister immediately texted back and told me that I was lying, that he had done no such thing, and that he is now threatening to k*l himself because I have brought back or triggered his \"PTSD trauma\" from an ex girlfriend saying he was ab*sive. Threatened to k*l himself, yes. \n\nI will add that I recognize that people have different standards of discipline for their dogs, and that depends on the owner. However, I see how they treat their dogs every single day and for almost a year now- I know what they consider a sensible amount of force/discipline. Let me say that compared to their normal, everyday treatment of their pets- this incident completely surpassed their limits as dog owners, especially those of my sister. Totally out of character, wildly out of their norm. I know that if she had witnessed this, she would have lost her mind.\n\nShe then resorted to comparing this situation to a relationship of mine where I had experienced physical abuse. She used an insult that followed the lines of \"when your ex bashed your head into a wall...\", the purpose of which I am still clueless to. To me this seemed as if she did not want to believe it, and took unnecessary anger out on me. I should also add that prior to this, while in my room or otherwise behind a closed door while he and I were home alone, I have overheard him uttering insults (screaming, shouting) at the puppy specifically (e.g. \"you stupid little f*cking b*tch, f*ck off I hope you d*e\"...and so on. As if she were a person.) I've mentioned this to my sister before and she didn't seem to care.\n\nAll in all, after she berated me over text for a bit, we essentially just didn't speak for a full day- and the next morning she said we were going to have a group conversation about it all. I told her I had nothing kind to add and that I didn't think it was a good idea. She ignored my request and brought him out, and they proceeded to team up on me and accuse me of being a liar. He teetered between claiming that it never happened, that he was rough with her (and feels bad) but it wasn't how I described it, that her paw slipped by accident, that he didn't answer me when it happened because he was \"upset with himself\" for accidentally hurting the dog. Just all over the place. \n\nMy sister stayed pretty silent compared to him through this, essentially allowing him to take whatever means necessary to discredit the accuser (me). He called me some very nasty things and I'm sickened that she did nothing about it. During his tirade against me, he also threatens to call the cops (my eyebrows were stuck to the ceiling). They have kicked me out and I have not spoken to her since. I'm hurt and cannot bear to look at my sister as anything other than ignorant to this serious situation. He is the perpetrator, but by omission- she is not providing her dog proper care. \n\nI am sad for a few reasons, namely: \n\n1. I have turned into the bad guy for letting my sister know that this happened\n2. My relationship with her feels unsalvageable  \n3. The dogs safety\n4. My sisters safety\n\nIf he does these things to a dog when he thinks he is alone, why should I expect he would treat his girlfriend differently? Considering how violently he speaks to her in front of myself and others, it terrifies me to think of what happens when they are alone. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667572944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym0u9d/aita_for_telling_my_sister_about_her_boyfriend/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
