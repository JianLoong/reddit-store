Your phrasing. I heard a parent say that to their kid recently.  Exactly that.

That guy said the EXACT same thing. \"You will deal with it or I will and no one will like it.\" \n\nDo you guys all know each other?\n\nOr is this some kind of lizard brain thing? Like you're so emotionally stunted you think threatening children in public is effective/ good? In replies you seem proud.  It's amazing.  You're proud of such an obvious failure?

I don't get all these YTA. They weren't supervising a group of children under their care. They were allowing them to run around a store putting, them, customers and products in danger. What if one of those kids had knocked someone down or run face first into a cart? You did control your kid when you saw what he was doing. Everyone jumping on the part of handle my son or I will and no one will like it, is BS. There are many meanings in that. The kid gets grounded, you report the teachers, you complain to the store manager and get them tossed out. You weren't taking down to them. You were pointing out the fact that they weren't doing their job.", "MTA, You say your son knows how to act in a store. Well he's not practicing what he supposedly knows. Sure the teachers should have had better control of the students but, your son needs a refresher on how to act. Be a parent not a buddy.", "Oof. Never ask redditors parenting questions. NTA but you can\u2019t expect teachers to do much when it comes to discipline - they don\u2019t have a lot of tools at their disposal when it comes to giving out consequences for bad behavior. I hope your son learned a lesson about not following the pack when everyone else is behaving like maniacs.", "You do realize you just threatened your son in front of his teachers right? You do know they are mandatory reporters right?\n\nYTA", "Nta. Your kid was running around a grocery store unsupervised. He could\u2019ve been hurt, kidnapped or got in big trouble. The fact that you were able to just go in there and grab a child is alarming in itself. Imagine if you weren\u2019t his parent\u2026Those teachers were being negligent. If you\u2019re going to take kids on what seems like an unauthorized field trip, the very least you can do is keep track of them.", "Nta.  Yeah, pull your kid out of that group.  They're encouraging bad habits by not correcting him and letting him earn a bad reputation in the neighborhood.  I'd complain to the school and ask the store manager to do the same.\n\nEveryone seems to be reacting to your last line like a threat.  Please clarify how.  If you mean grounding him and calling the principal and other parents I have no problem with it.\n\nAlso, I agree that after school groups, teachers and babysitters need to be able to discipline and control the kids in their care.  Yes the kids behaviour is a reflection on the parent, but if the teacher is ignoring bad behaviour they're just as at fault.", "NTA.
