It's how they grow and learn, it's absolutely natural. Your role as parent/educator is to set clear boundaries that both guide your child and secure them emotionally ( establishing boundaries is a direct and clear way to show your kids that you care for them and love them), eventhough they hate it at times, in the long run they feel secured by it.\n\nClearly they know where the boundaries are with dad, but also know that the \"teachers\" are lax or simply don't care enough to put a stop to their behaviour.\n\nAlso, what about liability?

A 10 yr old should know better! Control your kids!  But let the dad try to hold the people in charge of his child accountable for their behavior and all of a sudden he is \"having an epic meltdown\" and his kid is \"scared into behaving\"\n\nCan't win on the internet.", "I worked at a grocery store in HS, kids his age would run around pretty regularly a decade ago. This isn\u2019t weird behavior.", "I\u2019m thinking that dad implied: I\u2019ll be reporting the teachers and this whole situation, I\u2019ll be removing my son from the program and he\u2019ll be grounded, and if other parents ask, I\u2019ll let them know the situation. \n\nIt\u2019s an inconvenience for the teachers to need to explain to admin what happened. Kid won\u2019t like being grounded and away from program with his friends, and the teachers also might have to answer to other people as well. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And can we talk about how OP grabbed his son and wouldn\u2019t let him go and marched him up to the teachers, who apparently didn\u2019t know he was the kid\u2019s dad? A random dude grabbing a student and not letting go is very disturbing. The fact that he was the dad makes it legal, but not less disturbing.", "How exactly do you monitor every child in a grocery store?  Do you have cameras in every aisle?\n\nAnd I'll put in twice as much effort as the average parent, how about that?", "See?  The teacher must always be on and must raise the child for you.", "Nope, I had parents who talked like that. He was implying he'd beat the shit out of his kid.", "If you can\u2019t monitor your class on outings like these teachers then do not go on outings.  Keep them within the school walls so that more eyes are on them and can help you do your job.", "Also you\u2019re being paid by the parents to preform a job function you admit you can\u2019t do.  So why are you trying to justify your inability to do it?  You\u2019re with the kids more than their parents get to be in most cases and for parents to know you can\u2019t do the job and aren\u2019t willing to do it either but you\u2019ll lay blame at their feet means you should quit now so someone more qualified can do it", "If students are under your care you have a responsibility to keep them behaving and safe to the best of you ability. You sound like one of those teachers that just don't give a fuck."]}
