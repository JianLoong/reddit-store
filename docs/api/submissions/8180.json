If you were that concerned about your nephew, you would have called CPS when these incidents occurred. Do you have any idea how incredibly underpaid and overworked CPS workers are?

I clearly get that you are very angry and feel used and discarded. If you don't want to hear from her anymore, block your sister on your phone, email, and socials. I know \"therapy!\" is a default answer here, but you seem to be hurting a lot, and what you are doing right now doesn't seem to be making things better for you.\n\nI have no idea who is the asshole here - too much missing INFO.

For someone so concerned for the baby you did just as poor of a job being around the baby and doing nothing to ensure their safety. Let alone as I said in another comment, it only took 21 credits for me to graduate highschool back in 2011. I doubt the education system changed THAT much in 10 years. You can't miss 19 credits in one year for someone who is essentially only pregnant for 10 months. You got mad because your sister cut you off from the baby.

Being given monster is nothing compared to the atrocities that await in foster care. AT ALL. You shoul look for alternate ways to help!

Not disputing that at all. I don't think that is OK at all.\n\nBut SA and physical abuse and often lack of necessary resources are a lot more common in the system. The foster system is a war zone and calling CPS will just put a kid in more danger\n\nIf OP was really worried they would educate on exactly that. Try to find another family member to take the child. Address the monster/other bad substances given to the kid when it happens, not when they are mad. Sharing Stories like your friends, getting facts to educate his shitty sister (btw thats awful for your friend). CPS isn't going to do anything about that aspect of it anyways.", "You literally said giving a kid monster is nothing compared to the atrocities that happen in foster care when monster will literally kill or permanently disable a baby, it's basically literal poison even for adults to the point where it's illegal in some countries, in what world is that not minimizing it", "calling CPS should have happened instantly when the child was in danger, not belated out of spite because you now got into a fight. Were you going to ignore the child endangerment if she hadn't done that to you? \n\nYTA for that", "ESH- You both clearly have longstanding issues that are now going to affect a child.

I\u2019d actually suggest being a bit more insistent when it comes to calling because everything you listen could have ended very tragically.
