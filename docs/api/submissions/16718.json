And it's free money stop complaining\n\nEdit: you are not entitled to his money, that's a better argument then my original argument. But he still decided $2000 is what he can afford and what he's willing to give you.", "He offered to let you borrow $2000 and you yelled at him? YTA you don\u2019t get to act like an entitled brat just because. Just because he can afford it, doesn\u2019t make you entitled to \u201cborrow\u201d it. Also what does his legal status have to do with the post??", "I'm going  esh: u wanted to get a loan and he talked you out of it.  Your instinct was to borrow an amount that would buy an appropriate car for your work needs.\n\nHe said not to.do that and get a shitty car that would've cost you more in the long term with no savings for repairs!\n\nHe should have either left you get the loan or offered enough to cover the difference - his way left you fucked\nBut its his money,once he said don't do that get a shitty car you shouldve said I'm getting the loan.", "YTA. You\u2019re not even married. He offered you 2k to help\u2026you yelled at him", "YTA. Just because he has it doesn't mean you are entitled to it.", "YTA. He owes you nothing and you are being entitled and manipulative. If he's as good with money as you say he'll probably be smart enough to get the fuck away from you ASAP.", "NAH because we need more INFO.\n\nI read your comment that you've been together three years. I think this is a moment where you need to have real conversation. Where does he (and you) see your relationship in the future? How do you plan to manage financials going forward?\n\nEveryone here saying Y T A for being upset by the amount. They're not getting to the route of the problem.", "YTA \u2026. So you want him to hand over more money so you don\u2019t have to use yours\u2026 \n\nThe roles aren\u2019t reversed and he has no right to loan you any money..", "Shit that's only $1000 less than OP was already planning on getting a loan on, *and it's a free $2000!*\n\nIf OP runs into an emergency after the fact before she can build up savings, she can take the loan out then. Money is fungible.", "No, she thinks its OK because she would give him the money in the same situation! Except she isn't in that situation, because she doesn't have the money.  \n\n\nShe feels entitled to his money because she's his girlfriend.", ">You weren't even originally considering a loan from him - you were going to get a personal loan\n\nNews flash - she didn't plan to get a personal loan\n\nshe just thought that if she told her bf she needed to take out a loan then he'd offer the money. It only partially worked and she's pissed. \n\nYTA", "She never ever had any intention of taking out a full loan. That was just her opening to tell her boyfriend the woe is me story and get him to offer to buy her a car. What she is really mad about is the fact that he didn't. That is why the fact he was even willing to kindly lend her over two thousand dollars was a \"slap in the face\" because her plan didn't work. He didn't offer to buy her a car!", "> to ask a dime more is just being greedy.\n\nShe didn't even ask. She just yelled at him and berated him for not knowing the amount he \"should\" have loaned her.", "Uhm, yeah, that reason is very clearly spelled out: OP is an immigrant busting her ass working two labor intensive jobs to better her situation who had a stroke of bad luck where her means for performing said jobs malfunctioned. That's the reason. \n\nWhat kind of comment even is this???", "I'm glad it wasn't just me who looked at that 100k, some of it apparently in stocks, and said \"Uhm, that is a very nice start at his age but not enough to be reckless with \" with housing costs being what they are & the inflation in the cost of consumer goods, 100k just isn't what it was even a decade ago...and depending on how he has organized it,  he may not be able to touch much of it without serious penalties from both the financial institution & the IRS (if they are in the US, which is my assumption). Some of that money may be locked up tight until he's 62.", "What a weird reading of the situation. It seems boyfriend has made smart financial decisions, and understands adding loan payments to an already struggling budget is going to make things tougher. He advised against it, because he thought it was a bad idea, and offered to loan her money. How does any of this comes across as trying to hold her back?", "been together 3 years", "You don\u2019t think she\u2019s an asshole for yelling at someone about money that she wasn\u2019t entitled to in the first place lol?", "How is the boyfriend an asshole? Because he didn't offer up more money? Doesn't matter if they've been together 10 days or 10 years, it's his money and she's not entitled to it.", "He\u2019s not an asshole for having money lol. She\u2019s not entitled to his money.", "How is he an asshole here? He offered her 2k and suggested she using the 3k she had so she wouldn't be under a loan. Which in the long run is the best financial decision to make in this situation.", "I find it laughable the people who say \u201cthey would give there money in a heart beat\u201d when they literally have no money to give.\nIt\u2019s the same as those people who lecture people about adopting children but have never opened there home to a child in need themselves.", ">Except she isn't in that situation, because she doesn't have the money.\n\nI think we all feel pretty confident she will never be in that situation.  Her BF should rest assured that the roles will never be reversed.", "This.\n\nShe tried to manipulate her BF and when he didn't play, she yelled at him.", "Yep.", "Yeah not the best word choice on my part. Should have maybe used \u201cdemand\u201d instead of ask.", "I doubt she would even pay him back.....given how she doesnt save much", "Still doesn't mean she's entitled to his money. He made an offer and he's smarter than she is in regards to money, so she should take his advice. Her situation is not her boyfriend's fault. She's broke and she needs to figure out what to do within her means.", "There's a lot that immigrants have to do to get ahead. A crap ton. Nobody is discounting that. Yes OP is working her ass off but that doesn't mean she can get angry at her BF for not buying a car or giving her  more money for a car. A stroke of bad luck isn't a go ahead for taking advantage of people or being angry that the help they were offered isn't enough. Many immigrants have successfully gone through life without thinking they were entitled to someone else's money.", "&#x200B;\n\n>What kind of comment even is this???\n\nexactly! what kind of comment even is this!", "You could be together for a decade and it wouldn't make you entitled to his money.", "He told her not to get a loan and instead offered her a private loan for $2K.  No further info or guidance.  Since he seems financially savvy, it would have been better if he had sat down with her and helped her review options and give her knowledge to make a good decision.", "Unless she\u2019s illegal she has just as much chance to earn/save the money up as anyone else.  He is under no obligation to give her thousands of dollars.  She\u2019s a girlfriend not a wife.", "Yeah that would've been great if she didn't lash out when he offered the 2k.", "He should have had the convo first before making any offers."]}
