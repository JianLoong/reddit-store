I (25M) have been married to Grace for almost 4 years and the issues with Joy started a couple of years ago but I ignored it until I felt like it was messing with my head. So I decided to tell Grace about this and so the conflict has started. But to give the full picture I need to give some background.\n\nI'm an affair baby. I was conceived the day my aunt passed away. My parents, her husband and her sister, always claimed it was a one time thing and happened in a moment of madness when they were both at their lowest point knowing their wife and sister was dying. That didn't change the fallout of what happened. The whole family found out about it. My half siblings/cousins were repulsed but even more when I came along. My maternal grandparents had a lot of mixed emotions but ultimately decided not to be in my life because my half siblings said they would lose them if they were in my life. My paternal grandparents made the same choice when posed with the same ultimatum. \n\nBoth my parents were present in my life growing up but they weren't together. My half siblings were all grown by the time I was 7 so they weren't in my life for long. But the years I was around them did a lot of psychological harm. I suffered from low self-esteem most of my life and I isolated myself as a way to not have more people hate me, and out of disgust for myself. My parents were frustrated by my actions. A few times they asked if it was my way of punishing them. They didn't understand and today we're very low contact.\n\nGrace knows about my background and my ILs do as well, including Joy. This is why I struggle with Joy. She knows but she has this habit of bringing up how important it is to have a good birth story when I'm around but Grace and the rest of my ILs are not. She has never said anything too extreme so I always dismissed it myself as me being sensitive due to my past and never said a thing. But then a couple of months ago we were at my ILs for Joy's birthday. Joy was chatting to some family friends and neighbors of my ILs and directly asked me to share my birth story with everyone. The whole thing caught me off guard and upset me. I felt like I was being called out and so I excused myself and started to isolate like I had in the past. Grace noticed and approached me to find out what was wrong. I knew Joy had been way more direct and cruel in her actions this time so I told Grace.\n\nGrace confronted Joy after the party ended and the two argued. Then the rest of my ILs found out. Ever since Joy has been pissed at me for snitching and telling on her like a child. She holds a very strong grudge against me for her family being unhappy with her. This makes her furious and she has claimed I handled it like a boy instead of a man.

That doesn't seem like a normal conversation topic to me. Honestly, it feels like she has a very unhealthy obsession with your circumstances and it's causing you harm. She deserves the blowback she's receiving.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nHow dare Joy think it\u2019s ok to share such a personal experience of yours\u2026.It\u2019s YOUR story to tell NOT hers and if she thinks it\u2019s an appropriate dinner party story she obviously likes to create drama AND has issues\n\nI\u2019d be going low contact with her and from now on you know not to trust Joy with anything", "NTA. Oh she can hand it out but she doesn't like taking it does she? What a witch. You need a comeback OP. \"Oh no, that's so dull. Instead why don't you tell us all how you grew up to be a witch? I'm sure everyone would like that. At least for my story I didn't have a choice, it just happened, you made a choice to be nasty\"", "You did the EXACT, PRECISE thing you should have done. Joy is your wife\u2019s sister, and your wife SHOULD BE taking the lead in situations like this. I\u2019d say the same if the opposite were true.\n\nEveryone I know is well aware that I don\u2019t keep secrets from my wife. Thus, they know that if they tell me something, then they can rest assured that my wife knows about it, too.\n\nAs for Joy\u2019s fascination with your birth story, that\u2019s just friggin weird at best, and malevolent at worst. \n\nNTA 1000%", "NTA. \n\n1. Joy is maliciously cruel. She knows what hurts you and she presses that button whenever she can get away with it.\n\n2. Snitching culture is designed to protect wrongdoers and is immoral and diversionary. You handled it like a man by disclosing her hidden awful behavior, which subjected her to the family shaming she richly deserves. Not sure what flavor her toxic idea of masculinity was, but what did she want? For you to hit her? For you to tell her to fuck off in front of acquaintances at a social gathering? \n\n3. You can ignore her and her diversionary grudge; it\u2019s simply a pivot in how she bullies you. Or you can counterattack every time she brings it up. Remind her that a woman with the viciousness of a bullying child has zero credibility as to what makes a man and that she is a stranger to maturity and integrity and needs to work on herself.\n\n4. Your history is a pretty strong indictment against the unfortunately all too common redditors who feel it\u2019s okay for siblings to dehumanize and ostracize affair babies.", "Nta", "NTA! Joy's obsession with birth stories seems a bit... odd? And asking you to share yours in front of a bunch of people is rude and inconsiderate, especially since she knows why this is something you wouldn't want to do.", "NTA - SIL is just mad that she can't publically bully and shame you without consequences anymore", "NTA - Joy is acting like a totally abusive a$$\n\n\"claimed I handled it like a boy instead of a man.\"\n\nThe pot calling the kettle black!!!  \n\nShe kept stirring the $hit pot, you just handed her the spoon and make her take a taste!!!", "NTA.

Your SIL knew that and still did it anyway. Also your wife is your partner. You can\u2019t \u201csnitch\u201d to your life partner. You are supposed to tell her things and having her handle her own sister is probably the best way to get it handled without causing extra harm and trauma to yourself. I\u2019m sorry but glad your wife had your back.", "NTA. This is extremely weird of her, and inappropriate. She\u2019s decided that you\u2019re an easy target, and she\u2019s pissed that you don\u2019t agree.", "NTA. Joy is bullying you and is treating you as badly as your siblings did, for something that is in no way your fault. She owes you an apology and I hope your wife continues to take your side in this because the behavior of her sister is totally unacceptable and cruel.", "That's what Grace said. When we talked about it she said it felt very deliberate and cruel. That if Joy was pregnant and thinking of birth stories because she wanted to give her own kid one, you could say it's related to that. But Joy has no kids and isn't pregnant. She doesn't bring this stuff up in typical conversations with her family. So it's aimed at me in a very obvious way.", "This \u2026 Joy is an AH.", "Grace said the same thing. She understood why I decided not to tell her before. She knows I struggle with my self esteem and whether something is trauma related or an actual genuine thing that is off. But she has reassured me I can always tell her and she can help me even if it is just something related to my trauma. I'm glad Grace has my back. Sometimes I struggle to have my own back so having a wife who is this compassionate and supportive is a lifesaver.", "Did you and Joy get along before she learned about your story? I'm wondering if she's always disliked you or if she has some sort of hangup about affairs and is punishing you for your parents' actions.", "I feel like we did. But I also feel like outside of this we get along pretty well. I'm not the greatest judge of this kind of thing because of my history though.", "Try not to stress about it. You're not responsible for the poor behavior of others. Joy has to deal with the consequences. You did the right thing by telling your wife and I'm glad she's on your side."]}
