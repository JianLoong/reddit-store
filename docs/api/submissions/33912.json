She owes you an apology and I hope your wife continues to take your side in this because the behavior of her sister is totally unacceptable and cruel.", "That's what Grace said. When we talked about it she said it felt very deliberate and cruel. That if Joy was pregnant and thinking of birth stories because she wanted to give her own kid one, you could say it's related to that. But Joy has no kids and isn't pregnant. She doesn't bring this stuff up in typical conversations with her family. So it's aimed at me in a very obvious way.", "This \u2026 Joy is an AH.", "Grace said the same thing.

That is some BS narrative she is trying to get you to believe.  You didn't tell on her like a child.  A child intentionally tries to hurt the other person by getting them in trouble with someone that is an authority figure.

And you were strong enough and smart enough to realize your wife is an ally and had your back.  So it backfired on Joy.\n\nBut Joy isn't willing to hang her head and beg for forgiveness for her wretchedness.  Instead she gets angry at you and expects you to handle it like a child would but tells you the cover story that you should have handled it like a man.  You did handle it like a man.  You didn't cause a scene, didn't get aggressive, didn't humiliate her in the moment, you disengaged so you could respond rather than react.  Anger is a secondary emotion, and it is covering the true feelings Joy cannot face about the situation.  \n\nI think a few sessions of counseling would help you work through these feelings of abandonment, and the triggers you still experience.

Best to go NC with SIL.", "NTA\nJoy is evil.", "A \"birth story\" isn't a thing. NTA but you should have told your wife sooner! You're not snitching, you're letting your wife deal with her c-box of a sister and now Joy is facing the actual consequences for being such and rhymes with runt.", "NTA.  This is absolutely horrifying!  Your \"birth story\" is completely irrelevant to Joy (and the rest of the universe, btw) and she should mind her own business.  How on Earth did she think gossiping about you to the neighbors was justifiable?  I am so sorry this happened to you!\n\nNo one has any right to judge you for what your parents did.  You were meant to exist for a reason, just like the rest of us.  Welcome, fellow human!", "NTA - Joy sure as heck is - but I'm confused...\n\nMy understanding of a \"birth story\" is it centers on the Mom's experience of pregnancy/labor/delivery.\n\nIs that a regional thing? Do other places / cultures instead center the birth story on the \\*child's memory\\* of being born? 'Cuz that sounds incredibly strange, let alone improbable.", "NTA. Always thought when people talked about birth story they meant the actual gross and horrifying aspects of Labor and Delivery that I'm forced to listen to every baby shower I attend. What your sister-in-law did was a needlessly cruel thing.", "What the f is a birth story??? Is this a cultural thing? If not then yes Joy is TAH. Either way you are NTA.", "Wife and sister are named \u201cGrace\u201d and \u201cJoy\u201d? Let me guess, conservative Christians?", "NTA - Joy went out of her way to embarrass you and got caught on it.", "NTA one bit.\n\nJoy is malicious & cruel. To do that to you in a social situation incredibly so.\n\nYou didn't snitch. You told your wife what has been happening & what your sister's been doing. It sounds like Grace is well named; she has your back & rightly so.\n\nYou've had to deal with a lot of s**t in your life, none of it your fault. You seem a pretty good example of a courageous man to me,  so ignore Joy's meaningless comment about boys.\n\nHer family are upset with her behavior & rightly so. That's none of your doing either.", "Grace by name but not by nature.  She should fuck off.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe knows she was wrong.", "NTA. What a bizarre, horrible woman. I don\u2019t know what her problem is, but this is definitely *her* problem. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You confided in your wife and you let her deal with her own family. Perfectly normal and acceptable response. She\u2019s mad that she\u2019s having to deal with the negative consequences of her shitty behavior, so she\u2019s trying to shift some of the blame for the situation on to you. It seems pretty clear that her constantly bringing it up was a deliberate attempt to embarrass or upset you, and so is this idea that you didn\u2019t handle it \u201clike a man.\u201d", "The only AH here is Joy. Why the heck would you need to tell a story like that to anyone? What business is of theirs?  Joy is pissed because she fed up and is getting called out for it.", "NTA. She knows she was overstepping, that\u2019s why she only did it when your wife wasn\u2019t around. This is what bullies do. Then they get mad if you fire back, or tell someone. Ignore her. The only one who should be upset is you. And maybe your wife on your behalf.", "\"OP, tell your birth story\"\n\n\"My mother and father spend an intimate moment together. Nine months later she had contractions, and after a lot of pushing, I popped up into the world straight out of her vagina. And now I'm sitting here talking about it because for some weird reason you're obsessed with me coming out of my mom's vagina.\"\n\nNTA", "Yeah, birth stories aren't really a thing like that. The only time I've ever encountered \"birth stories\" being a thing is in a new mother's group where everyone was talking about how their experience giving birth to their child went.", "Yup- and if she dares to bring it up again, change the story every time. Pick a story from a random, ridiculous sit-com, \u2018cause no one ever gives birth on TV unless they\u2019re trapped in an elevator, or on a plane that\u2019s been hijacked or there\u2019s 7 feet of snow outside or something.", "You hit every available nail on the head. Thank you.\n\nI would advise OP to go NC with Joy: not low contact, no contact. Write Joy a diplomatic snail-mail letter explaining her cruelty and your refusal to be bullied. End it with an important promise: \u201cThis is the last time I will communicate with you, ever.\u201d\nDo repeat this process for any other family members who are too dense to see the obvious. \n\nFinally, once they\u2019re gone, live well: it\u2019s the best possible revenge.", "Which is sad,  as the child had no choice in what their parents did.", "I don't get this birth story bs\n\nI mean my sibling gets the weighed 6 lbs 9 oz story(mum said if she'd stuck to that she'd not had sibling).  I don't recall any sort of birth story for me.", "I\u2019ve never been part of a discussion where people talked about their own births. I think she\u2019s doing this intentionally to be hurtful.", "People use fake names on this sub dawg, I wouldn't read too far in to it.", "\"Straight outta Vagina\"", "Yeah, but in that case it says something to OP\u2019s mindset, and thus the community that they exist within. I\u2019m guessing judgmental religious folk, because that\u2019s exactly who concerns themselves with the provenance and circumstance of someone\u2019s conception.", "NTA and above is key, Joy only did this when her family was NOT around. It's pretty obvious this was some kind of passive aggressive dig at OP that she did not want the rest of her family to see.", "If that were true, why is SIL the only one of them who actually cares? Doesn't scream super religious judgemental to me when it's just her making socially inept digs at OP. I have a SIL who is the exact type of person to say shit like this and find nothing wrong with it and she is not religious at all.", "NTA.\n\nI think you need to ask why your sister-in-law is so eager for everyone to know your birth story about a man having an affair with his sister-in-law.\n\nFreud would have a field day.", "NTA. Sounds like SIL is jealous.", "If the truth about your actions makes people angry with you, the problem is your actions. She was well aware of what she was doing. She's just pissed she got caught.", "NTA - Tell Joy you are going NC with her until she apologizes and you see a difference in her. Hold that line.  She is the AH and you will be better off without talking to her again.", "NTA\nYou communicated with your partner. Positive reinforcement for communicating with your partner. That is something an adult in a relationship does. Joy got consequences for being intentionally mean repeatedly.   Also, demanding someone tell their \u201cbirth story\u201d at a gathering people is a strange thing EVER to do, even if she didn\u2019t know how complex your background was. That she knew and wanted you to perform it for people would make me think she enjoys torturing people. All the better to out her.", ">she has this habit of bringing up how important it is to have a good birth story\n\nSuch would imply that people have control over the circumstances of their births. That is about the dumbest shit I have heard in my life, and I have heard a LOT of dumb shit.\n\nDefinitely NTA. Joy was quite mis-named, though. If she didn\u2019t want the family mad at her she shouldn\u2019t have been such an oozing taint.", "NTA joy has some serious issues going on. A good birth story? What the hell does that even mean? She needs some serious mental health help.", "Joy wants to pick up where OP's siblings/cousins left off and put him through that childhood pain again. Hence the \"like a child\" and \"boy\" comments... However, OP's wife and other in-laws seem to totally back OP, which is fantastic to know. That's a far cry from OP's original family. NTA.", "NTA.\nJoy is definitely an unhappy, bullying AH.\nGlad Grace and the rest of the family put her in her place.", "NTA. She's mad you finally grew a backbone and stood up to her and let others know about her petty bullying.", "This is absolutely perfect.", "I was wondering the same thing. I have never in my life been asked that or heard of anyone who has. I would probably have just answered \u201cmy mom pushed me out her vagina.\u201d", "\"Joy, dear, if your sister /my wife was dying, I still wouldn't even blow out a load on your ugly face. Now piss off\"...", "Joy wants to \\*be\\* that sister-in-law.", "You certainly can't fix people, but I just want to reinforce that people who treat children badly because of what their parents did are behaving repulsively. \n\nI literally do not care what reason - treating little you badly was sick, and every time I see people excuse it I see red.", "I\u2019m really glad your wife supported you. Her sister is the AH.", "Kudos to you both OP.  Wishing you many, many happy and wonderful years together!!!\n\nNTA.", "Your wife is great, as are the rest of your ILs for letting Joy have it for her malicious, bullying behaviour. As for Joy, if she is ever again in a position to complain to you about setting her family against her, tell her that if what she was doing was so innocent and harmless, why would telling others about her behaviour constitute \"snitching\", or be problematic?", "Wow. Your paternal family sucks. I'm sorry you had to deal with that."]}
