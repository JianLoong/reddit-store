My half siblings were all grown by the time I was 7 so they weren't in my life for long. But the years I was around them did a lot of psychological harm.

This is why I struggle with Joy. She knows but she has this habit of bringing up how important it is to have a good birth story when I'm around but Grace and the rest of my ILs are not. She has never said anything too extreme so I always dismissed it myself as me being sensitive due to my past and never said a thing. But then a couple of months ago we were at my ILs for Joy's birthday. Joy was chatting to some family friends and neighbors of my ILs and directly asked me to share my birth story with everyone. The whole thing caught me off guard and upset me. I felt like I was being called out and so I excused myself and started to isolate like I had in the past. Grace noticed and approached me to find out what was wrong. I knew Joy had been way more direct and cruel in her actions this time so I told Grace.\n\nGrace confronted Joy after the party ended and the two argued. Then the rest of my ILs found out.

You can ignore her and her diversionary grudge; it\u2019s simply a pivot in how she bullies you. Or you can counterattack every time she brings it up.

Your SIL knew that and still did it anyway. Also your wife is your partner. You can\u2019t \u201csnitch\u201d to your life partner.

I\u2019m sorry but glad your wife had your back.", "NTA. This is extremely weird of her, and inappropriate. She\u2019s decided that you\u2019re an easy target, and she\u2019s pissed that you don\u2019t agree.", "NTA. Joy is bullying you and is treating you as badly as your siblings did, for something that is in no way your fault. She owes you an apology and I hope your wife continues to take your side in this because the behavior of her sister is totally unacceptable and cruel.", "That's what Grace said. When we talked about it she said it felt very deliberate and cruel. That if Joy was pregnant and thinking of birth stories because she wanted to give her own kid one, you could say it's related to that. But Joy has no kids and isn't pregnant. She doesn't bring this stuff up in typical conversations with her family. So it's aimed at me in a very obvious way.", "This \u2026 Joy is an AH.", "Grace said the same thing. She understood why I decided not to tell her before. She knows I struggle with my self esteem and whether something is trauma related or an actual genuine thing that is off. But she has reassured me I can always tell her and she can help me even if it is just something related to my trauma. I'm glad Grace has my back. Sometimes I struggle to have my own back so having a wife who is this compassionate and supportive is a lifesaver.", "Did you and Joy get along before she learned about your story? I'm wondering if she's always disliked you or if she has some sort of hangup about affairs and is punishing you for your parents' actions.", "I feel like we did. But I also feel like outside of this we get along pretty well. I'm not the greatest judge of this kind of thing because of my history though.", "Try not to stress about it. You're not responsible for the poor behavior of others. Joy has to deal with the consequences. You did the right thing by telling your wife and I'm glad she's on your side.", "NTA\n\nJoy sounds like a psychopath. This is really twisted behaviour and you should avoid contact with Joy in the future. If you are both at family events then make sure you are never alone with her or in any conversation with her and others.\n\nNormally, an apology would be expected, but in this case, I would not believe it .", "NTA. What has happened is Joy is a bitch who is overstepping every boundary and trying to humiliate you. Then she got call out and naturally people are pissed at her and she is trying to gaslight you to say you are the problem...like your whole life because that's what you have been led to believe.\n\nYou are not the problem honey. Never have been. Next time she pulls a stunt like this come up with a plausible but fake birth story. Like i dunno mmm your named after a reporter who came to do a piece on a maternity ward they took your picture and youre in the paper parents didn't know what to call you so picked reporters name.\n\nYou were born in a car repair shop because your mum went into labour whilst she was waiting for her car to be emergency repaired and by the time paramedics got there you mum was too far into labour to be moved and so she gave birth to you there.\n\nI dunno a random story.

You picked well when it comes to spouses. I hope her love goes a ways toward healing your childhood demons.", "NTA. You don\u2019t control the circumstances of your birth. And for her to try and embarrass you over it is disgusting. Good on your wife for sticking up for you! \n\nI would advise not speaking with Joy again.

Actually, the first time she said anything would have gotten a smack down and after that I'd have told spouse and every other time (strike 3) after that I'd had snarkily referred to it in front of people so they knew she had an issue with it. Is is snitching when you do a full blown shout out to everyone? \"What did I mean by that? Oh, just that Joy's obsessed with how I came into existence. She brings it up pretty much every time I see her. Maybe that means if wife dies she thinks I'll bang her. Kind of macabre waiting around for that Joy, dear. Not gonna happen either.\"", "NTA.\n\nIf you don't want people to know you behaved badly, don't behave badly. It's as simple as that. Joy was intentionally trying to embarrass you. Others found out about her actions. She now needs to accept the outcome of her actions and, ideally, should apologize to you for her behavior in this one incident as well as in the past.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, you did handle it like a man.

She is not a good person. \n\nI guarantee this is not the first time her family has dealt with her cruel & malicious behavior.", "NTA - You had an issue with someone in your wife's family and you spoke with your wife so she could deal with it. Joy is just a cruel bully who needs to be taken down a peg or two. I can't imagine someone seriously asking for a birth story it is absurd and it was only being done to be cruel.", "NTA.  That is some BS narrative she is trying to get you to believe.  You didn't tell on her like a child.  A child intentionally tries to hurt the other person by getting them in trouble with someone that is an authority figure.  This isn't what you did.  \n\nWhat you did is try to get the pain you were feeling to stop.  You explained to your partner why your behavior changed, \\*which is what you are supposed to do!!!\\*.   Joy put you in this situation to humiliate you, to make you feel less than everyone else.  She likes the power it gives her. She felt it was her birthday so she could get away with it.  And you were strong enough and smart enough to realize your wife is an ally and had your back.  So it backfired on Joy.\n\nBut Joy isn't willing to hang her head and beg for forgiveness for her wretchedness.  Instead she gets angry at you and expects you to handle it like a child would but tells you the cover story that you should have handled it like a man.  You did handle it like a man.  You didn't cause a scene, didn't get aggressive, didn't humiliate her in the moment, you disengaged so you could respond rather than react.  Anger is a secondary emotion, and it is covering the true feelings Joy cannot face about the situation.  \n\nI think a few sessions of counseling would help you work through these feelings of abandonment, and the triggers you still experience.   You did well here.  Don't let her twist your mind.  She is not your friend.", "NTA.
