Sam passed him the salt instead, my mom asked if anything was wrong, and I said that nothing was wrong. Josh then asked me to pass the potatoes, and I ignored him again.

Oh well, probably just the wind.\u201d Josh smacked his palms on the table and stormed off. \n\nSam was full on cackling, my dad was confused as hell, and my mom gave me a death glare before going off to talk to Josh.

It's too much trouble to monitor your brother's rudeness and bigotry, so they say, Just be the doormat, dear, because your feelings don't matter.\n\nBut you weren't the doormat. You paid him back. You did great!", "Right? Like, let's review. OP ignoring her brother for one night at dinner: Unacceptable. Immediate lecture from mom.\n\nBrother making graphic sexual jokes about his sister for what sounds like days to weeks: Unworthy of parental intervention, just ignore him and he'll stop.", "The only people in this family I respect are OP and Sam, and I\u2019m a mom in my 50s.\n\nMom & dad should never accept the 13 yos behavior. Were they raised by rabid wolves?!", "Exactly. Mom sucks at her job.\n\nNTA.", "Yep \"I didn't hear anything, must be the wind\" is like, first day of older sibling 101. It's what you say and do when you're bored and wanna annoy someone a little. The fact that even got a reaction is wild, but especially so when their reaction to biphobia is \"ignore it\"", "Sorry but being a bigot is NOT part of normal  teenage development. Get out of here with that.", "I've done what OP did just because of boredom. Like, it's not a big deal at all. If it wasn't for the ridiculous double standards and biphobia, it'd make me laugh that OP's actions are treated like such a big deal", "Sam is the 13yo. It\u2019s Josh(15) who\u2019s the issue", "Some folks on here have an itchy trigger finger for the nuke button in any given situation. For marriage problems it's divorce, for anything involving kids it's CPS. Don't take it too seriously. Some people are just overdramatic.\n\nMind you, there are stories that get posted here where one of those responses is definitely warranted.", "Yes, and Sam is awesome.", "Josh is bullying him for his sexuality. And the parents don't care because they're homophobes too.", "Yeah bi people aren't really oppressed /s My God the biphobes are out in force in this thread.", "NTA. \n\nAnd Sam sounds like a fun kid!!", "nta", "While yes, I suppose you could have handled it differently, that was (imho) still legendary, just as your brother said.

Ask your parents which is worse. \n\nYou told your mom your brother was being inapprotriate and she told you to handle it. So you did. Next time she could actually do something to disipline her misbehaving, and insulting, child. \n\nNTA", "NTA in the least. You know what parent gives the \"ignore them and they'll stop\" advice? Parents who ignore their children's emotional needs.\n\nI learned very early when my mom said \"if you ignore them they'll go away\" what she actually meant was \"I don't care about your feelings, please go away\".

And instead of parenting the situation, your mother has decided boys will be boys. What else are you supposed to do?", "Why is it ok for your brother to be gross but not for you to ignore him?\n\nIn light of the golden child being supported by your parents it might be a better tactic to respond to Josh's \"jokes\" with \"It's very creepy that you are so interested in my sexuality. Your own sister.\" \n\nNTA", "\"She said that if I had a problem with her advice, I should have gone to her\"\n\nYou went to her already and her advice was to ignore him.

You may tolerate Josh or you may just meet your parents when he isn't around.  You are red flagged this for your parents now.  In the years to come if they are upset because you don't have a relationship with Josh, it was their choice.  \n\nWhen somebody works to extinguish any affection you have for them, they cannot then wonder in the years to come, why you don't care about them", "You are a legend OP \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nNTA", "NTA sorry your parents are such utter garbage at their jobs that Josh can act like an absolutely disgusting asshole and make \"jokes\" and get away with it but if you choose to not speak to him over it YOU get in trouble? nah fuck that shit your parents are failing so hard and just showing you and sam who their golden child is", "She can't complain about an issue she doesn't want to address herself you're nta \n\nYou are however as your brother said an absolute legend", "Soo she can\u2019t talk to josh about his behaviour, but as soon as you retaliate and he throws a whole ass pissbaby tantrum she\u2019s off to coddle his fee fees and telling you how unacceptable you\u2019re being.\n\nNTA.\n\nAsk her why josh is her favourite?", "Well played.  Next, record his gross insults and play them at dinner.  NTA", "NTA\n\nIf it was unwarranted sure but you had cause and the \"suggested\" resolution was rubbish. Yes this raised it in a ugly manner but rather that than something else and maybe your brother will learn some manners.", "She *can* be bothered though; she\u2019s up OP\u2019s ass in a flash.

You just take it and don't bother me\" \n\nNotice that that bit about it not being a big deal did not extend to OP ignoring the brother for a few minutes .\n\nEither she favourites her sons, or she favourites Josh. This shit is just terrible parenting.", "Bold of you to assume the parents will really do anything about it. I feel like a guidance counselor or something is probably a better person to talk to. Maybe a mandated reporter who might scare them straight.", "Sounds like brother is the golden child", "Damn straight, Sam said it best. Siblings know! And witnessing one sibling getting under the skin of another when you know good and well they deserve it is classic family table time drama! OP is NTA, she tried the other ways then followed her dear mothers advice, it worked like a charm and gave Sam a giggle.
