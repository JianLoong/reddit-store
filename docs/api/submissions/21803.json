That\u2019s been her favorite line throughout my childhood; I wasn\u2019t surprised. I decided to take her advice in the pettiest (and probably AHish) way possible. \n\nThe next time I saw my brother was at dinner, and he asked me to pass the salt. I did nothing. Sam passed him the salt instead, my mom asked if anything was wrong, and I said that nothing was wrong. Josh then asked me to pass the potatoes, and I ignored him again. My mom passed him the potatoes and asked me more directly why I was ignoring Josh, and I said \u201cwho?\u201d \n\nAt this point, Sam started crack up and Josh was getting red in the face. My mom responded \u201cyour brother Josh, honey are you ok?\u201d I then said \u201cmy one and only brother is named Sam, who are you talking about?\u201d Josh got fed up and interjected with \u201c[my name], are you going crazy? I\u2019m right here!\u201d At that point, I couldn\u2019t keep a straight face anymore and I, while cracking up, said \u201cDid you guys hear something? I could have sworn I heard a voice. Oh well, probably just the wind.\u201d Josh smacked his palms on the table and stormed off. \n\nSam was full on cackling, my dad was confused as hell, and my mom gave me a death glare before going off to talk to Josh. My dad asked what was going on, and I explained. He sighed and called me immature, and Sam called me a legend and went back to eating his food. \n\nLater that night, my mom told me that what I did was unacceptable. She said that if I had a problem with her advice, I should have gone to her instead of taking it out on Josh. My dad agreed with her.
