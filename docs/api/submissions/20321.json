In fact, you might venture into AH territory if you did force him to go back to that abusive environment. Nate can make his own choices. You didn't hide anything from him. The parents just don't like that they have to live with the consequences of their actions.  Abusive people having completely miraculous self revelations are pretty rare, so Nate has to protect himself.  His dad is still coming from a place of selfishness, not from a realization that he was completely wrong.\n\nA person who can be mean to a stranger...fine, not a good person. But anyone who could throw away their own child is a special kind of evil. A person who can accept and home and love that child when there was no obligation is truly an incredible person.", "If Nate wants to reconcile he'll do it at his own time and pace, and I think it is best that nobody interferes with his  decision.", "NTA and I'm glad you gave him a safe place . Could have ended really bad for him otherwise. It's up to him if he wants to reconcile or not.", "Ultimately, it is Nate's decision, which is what you're telling him. You might encourage him to do \"baby steps\" w/them if he chooses. \n\nStart with meeting/having them for dinner with you & your wife present. If that goes well, Nate might meet w/them on his own.

Do his parents have a way to communicate with Nate or is all communication through you? Do you have legal custody of him? \n\nThis is hard to judge. On the one hand you may be respecting what Nate wants and he may not be ready to reconcile. On the other, it does almost sound like you like having Nate around so, why put in the effort to facilitate any reconciliation.", "NAH, you did the right thing, you were the messager and nothing more", "for what you did for Nate - NTA -  HOWEVER, you are now venturing into AH territory.  do you have legal custody of Nate?  its obviously you love him and are helping him, but at the end of the day, you are not his parents.  i suggest getting a family therapist to help work through this.  it sounds like Nate's parents are doing a great deal of work to repair the attitudes that led to the damage, and it is now your job to help reconcile the family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We \"reconciled\" when we announced our wedding but I must admit I never felt the same about them again - going back to Northern Ireland to see them for a weekend once a year was the extent of my filial duty.

You are protecting a kid from emotional abuse. Simple as that. Its their responsibility to make it up to him, not yours.

In fact the complete opposite of an AH.  The father kicked him out at age 13 and mom went along with it.  Who cares if they're all unicorns and rainbows now.  Where were they the last three years of his life while you were paying his way and being a good parent to him.  Hope dad's afraid he will die and go to hell for this, and wants to appease whatever deity he believes in.  Guaranteed dad is not nearly as ok with his son as he is pretending to be.  Nate will never forget what they did, and if they think they will all just go back to the same relationship they used to have, they are delusional.  His dad is trash, but his mom is almost worse for staying with a homophobic prick who would throw away a 13 year old child.", "NTA, I don\u2019t even need to explain it, everyone else has.

They should take comfort in the fact that they know their child is safe and alive despite their failures as parents because they could be facing the cancer diagnosis not knowing what happened.", "I just thought that, how do you steal someone they threw away like they were literal trash \n\nSo what dad's sick, he will have to find another way into heaven then forcing his child he threw away 3yrs ago to move back in", "They threw away a literal child. What would have happened to that kid had OP and his family not been there as a safety net? Bad things happen to children left to fend for themselves. Of course, their son doesn't want a reconciliation. Why would he? His parents may or may not be sincerely sorry for what they did but they did it without a second thought.

As Nate's legal guardian, it is OP's job to make sure he feel safe, loved, wanted and heard. The parents do not get to bully their way back into Nate's life just because they feel guilty 3 years later AFTER finding out the \"father\" might have cancer.", "They actually have every reason to believe that Nate is no longer safe, emotionally or physically, in his parents\u2019 home. And very little reason to believe that\u2019s changed. The parents expressing *tentative* interest in *possibly* letting their son move back in is not good enough. Not to mention they\u2019ve been strangers to him for *three years*, and he is now plenty old enough to decide for himself if he wants to know them again.\n\nHe\u2019s safe, cared for, and loved where he is.

Basically you paper over the cracks and pretend that everything is fine without ever apologizing or making amends.", "hugs", "The dad just doesn't want to be thought of as THAT asshole who went to his grave with his son still estranged from him lol", "I don\u2019t even think they want to reconcile. I would bet my next paycheck that they want Nate to move back in so they can try and \u201cfix\u201d him before his dad passes away. His dad probably sees this as his last chance to."]}
