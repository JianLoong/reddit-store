Even if his dad was genuinely remorseful (his attitude doesn't seem to be tho), Nate's relationship with his parents will never be the same.", "NTA for protecting a child you love - but for Nates sake, he needs to speak with his parents before its too late.  They made the strides to find acceptance, and he needs to hear that or he will always feel that rejection.  Talk to him more about doing this for HIM!  If he can have a relationship with his Dad and Mom before anything tragic happens, it might make all the difference in the world.   Maybe he needs to do this in a controlled setting first - with a therapist, counselor - some third party that can also protect Nate.", "NTA. Kids aren't toys that can be put down and picked up again at a parent's convenience. Nate's parents kicked him out for being gay. While it's great that they're trying to be more accepting, the damage to their relationship with him is done. The pain they inflicted on their own child doesn't just go away because they've become accepting.\n\nI sincerely hope that one day Nate is able to reconcile with his parents but that doesn't happen overnight. It may never happen and if it does it has to be because he wants to reconcile. Forgiveness has to be freely given by those we hurt. It cannot be demanded. And while Nate could forgive his parents, they're still not entitled to a relationship with him. Forgiveness and reconciliation aren't the same thing. He can forgive them and never want to see them again.\n\nStill, neither should be expected or demanded. If my parents turned their backs on me there would be no going back.", "NTA.

You can have a conversation to make sure he feels safe in whatever that decision is but it's his choice and he should be forced into anything he doesn't want.", "NTA.If they are serious about reconciliation they should first sincerely apologize to their son with no excuses. Then they should ask him to attend family therapy with them. They need to start slow like go out for lunch together to get to know their son again.

They didn\u2019t want their kid. They handed their kid over to you. That kid has no obligation to give a second chance to parents who didn\u2019t want him. And you are under no obligation to \u201cmake\u201d him.\n\nNate has every right to go no contact with his parents.", "As someone who didn't go to my mom when she died and doesn't regret it, I think you should have a thoughtful conversation with Nate. 100% NTA for not forcing him, and I'm not encouraging you to pressure him. But I think if you haven't, you should make it clear that you'll support him in whatever he wants to do and that you wouldn't see to as a betrayal or weakness or anything like that. Closure with my mom came from me and a therapist, not anything she was willing to say or do, but if I'd cut her off when I was 16 I would have second guessed and guilt tripped myself. That doesn't mean that Nate is the same as me, but he needs you - the competent parents in his life - to tell him that contact doesn't have to mean forgiveness, that giving his parents the 'win' they want doesn't mean that he is 'losing', and that he can change his mind or redefine his boundaries whenever he wants.\n\nI think him moving back in is a terrible idea, but starting with emails/letters (something that slows down communication and allows for rereading/editing) might be a good idea. My sister had me pre-reading her emails from our mom for awhile, to make sure that they weren't filled with anything unforgivable.\n\nI know that it's counter intuitive to say that contact with terrible people can be a good idea and I am the *last* person to say that you owe someone something because *family* or that maintaining a blood relationship is worth abuse. I just don't want Nate to wonder as an adult if he made an inpulsive decision out of anger.", "Not just three years ago, it was when he was 13. That is child abandonment. The kid was just lucky that OPs family were there for him. \nThat kid will most likely be dealing with that for the rest of his life, but now his dad has got sick it's time to play happy families.", "I agree. He needs to get his independence legalized before they can rescind the guardianship. I'm pretty certain it's illegal to kick out a 13-year-old. His parents could've been charged with neglect of a child. And their actions certainly won't look good in court when he requests the courts permanently sever that tie.", "Let's say Nate's real dad (OP) did discourage reconciliation with the worthless bio-dad. I say that's a good parenting move, likely to spare Nate future hurt from people who have shown who they are by reprehensible actions (Nate could have DIED due to their extreme negligence).", "And if dad doesn't have cancer, will they kick him out again?", "NTA - thank you so much for what you\u2019ve done for Nate. You\u2019ve given him a parents love and support when his own bio-parents threw him aside. I say \u201cbio-parents\u201d because it is clear that you and your wife have become his Real parents.\n\nThis is Absolutely Nate\u2019s decision and his alone. Continue to support him in whatever he decides to do and don\u2019t push him one way or another on this. If he wants to communicate with them and explain his POV he can write them a letter that you can deliver on his behalf. If he does decide to talk to his bio-parents, offer to be there with him. \n\nBut honestly, his parents can basically get fucked: they made their homophobic little bed and now his bio-dad gets to die in it.", "NTA.  Nate seems more than capable of making his own choices.  Why on earth would he be willing to go back to the \"home\" that refused to accept his orientation?  His parents punted him.

You can coerce them into pretending to, but that\u2019s not reconciliation", "NTA but Nate\u2019s parents sure are. It\u2019s good that his mother was trying but they\u2019ve done some serious damage to the relationship and that\u2019s on them. OP seems like a real gem, we need more of this!", "NTA, they threw a teenager to the streets, wich is a crime I might add, and years after they are ready to have a relationship? They lost that right the day they kicked him out, what if your family weren't there or weren't able to house him? Not the parents appear to be as selfish now as then, they may have a right to start a relationship,talking bumy phone or maybe meeting slowly progressing, but expecting a parent relationship after what they did? They don't deserve that.", "NTA at all. You put the child first, as you should.\nYour family has stepped up big time and now he's doing better than ever.\n\nIf the dad says you 'stole' his child again, I'd be pointing out that you can't steal what someone has chosen to *throw away*.", "NTA. They threw him out. They don\u2019t get to force him back home. If I were him I\u2019d be worried it was a lie and the second I went back to their house they\u2019d ship me off to some pray away the gay camp or something. If they can\u2019t understand why he\u2019d be reluctant and are getting mad at you about it, I doubt they\u2019ve really done the work on themselves to become good parents and decent people.", "NTA, but is my math correct because 3 years ago would make Nate 13...they kicked their 13 year old out?! My God, that's so hurtful and disgusting. Who does that? Sorry but that is traumatic and abusive, and now they're reaping the consequences of their actions. I hope Nate finds closure with whatever he decides to do, but it's a long road to forgiveness at this point. They fucked up big time and only have themselves to blame.", "Also, their plan is to force a teenager to move back in and watch his (dirtbag) father suffer through cancer and possibly die a slow, painful, horrific death. Their goal is literally just to traumatize this kid again, but in a more drawn out way this time. \n\nIf Nate isn't in therapy, he needs to be. OP, die on this hill. Nate is a human being, not a game or toy that can be dropped for several years and only picked back up when you feel like it. These people don't care about his health, his wellbeing, or him as a whole human being with emotions and needs equal to their own. Protect him.", "Exactly. I really hope they don\u2019t attempt to guilt trip Nate into returning or even having a relationship with them that he doesn\u2019t want, due to their previous disgusting actions. Having an abusive parent become ill is an extremely confusing thing to deal with and I\u2019m glad OP is more than willing to support him", "\"You are not the parents\"\n\nWe found the parents' rights advocate.  Cool. \n\nThey threw away a kid.   For no good reason.   Barring a court order, the decision to return to bio parents home should not be encouraged.   Who knows if it's genuine?   \n\n*is now your job to help reconcile the family*\n\nYeah, no.   Family doesn't make you homes when you're 13 just because yiu like boys."]}
