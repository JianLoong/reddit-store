His father wants to blame everyone except for himself.", "NTA you\u2019re a good person", "NTA. So far from it. In fact, you might venture into AH territory if you did force him to go back to that abusive environment. Nate can make his own choices. You didn't hide anything from him. The parents just don't like that they have to live with the consequences of their actions.  Abusive people having completely miraculous self revelations are pretty rare, so Nate has to protect himself.  His dad is still coming from a place of selfishness, not from a realization that he was completely wrong.\n\nA person who can be mean to a stranger...fine, not a good person. But anyone who could throw away their own child is a special kind of evil. A person who can accept and home and love that child when there was no obligation is truly an incredible person.", "If Nate wants to reconcile he'll do it at his own time and pace, and I think it is best that nobody interferes with his  decision.", "NTA and I'm glad you gave him a safe place . Could have ended really bad for him otherwise. It's up to him if he wants to reconcile or not.", "Ultimately, it is Nate's decision, which is what you're telling him. You might encourage him to do \"baby steps\" w/them if he chooses. \n\nStart with meeting/having them for dinner with you & your wife present. If that goes well, Nate might meet w/them on his own. (And if they *don't* go well, he knows he's part of your family; he can go LC/NC with them at any point)\n\nEmphasize that this doesn't mean he has to MOVE back home! But\\~ if he wants to have a relationship w/them AND live with you, that is possible.", "These names & the situation sound familiar. Have you ever posted about Nate before? Your post history says your account was created today, so maybe you had another account. \n\nNTA. It sounds like the only reason they want to reconcile is because the dad has a terminal illness.", "INFO: It's hard to tell the tone of your conversation with Nate. If you didn't try to sway him in one direction or the other, then NTA, but I have a sneaking suspicion that you may have discouraged him and are leaving that part out of your post...\n\nPoint being, reconciling or not should be Nate's decision.", "NTA, ultimately it should be Nates decision and between him and his parents. However, your motives are selfish, and I think if his parents have changed it would be wrong not to at least encourage it", "Info - what conversations did you have with Nate? Do his parents have a way to communicate with Nate or is all communication through you? Do you have legal custody of him? \n\nThis is hard to judge. On the one hand you may be respecting what Nate wants and he may not be ready to reconcile. On the other, it does almost sound like you like having Nate around so, why put in the effort to facilitate any reconciliation.", "NAH, you did the right thing, you were the messager and nothing more", "for what you did for Nate - NTA -  HOWEVER, you are now venturing into AH territory.  do you have legal custody of Nate?  its obviously you love him and are helping him, but at the end of the day, you are not his parents.  i suggest getting a family therapist to help work through this.  it sounds like Nate's parents are doing a great deal of work to repair the attitudes that led to the damage, and it is now your job to help reconcile the family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We \"reconciled\" when we announced our wedding but I must admit I never felt the same about them again - going back to Northern Ireland to see them for a weekend once a year was the extent of my filial duty.
