This event was more than a wedding, and it seems it was also significantly a family reunion, that your parents had a major role in orchestrating.

You mom is absolutely incorrect and is no where near a good point unless you got specific approval before the wedding and included the then bride and groom in the pregnancy revelation in some way.

Also, announcing to non-close family members as you described is perfectly acceptable method through social media or send texts, cards in mail or whatever else is out there to do so.", "NTA for not upstaging your brother at his wedding. Your brother and SIL both thanked you for that; that's enough to tell you that you did the right thing.\n\nAlso, your mom is nuts: if you're not going to see these guests again \"for years\" they're obviously not people you're extremely close to emotionally, and they don't need to be told in person.", "NTA - telephones, email, video calls, social media, and postal mail are all things that can share the news.

If so, the best interests of your brother/SIL is greater than those of just your mom.\n\nBe careful with your mom going forward.  If she can discard the best interests of your brother/SIL, she might be an overbearing GM.

You didnt want to ruin your siblings event and steal the spotlight. \n\nYou can tell people youre pregnant over social media. Other than a congratulations theres not much they can do until after Baby arrives. A wedding is an event people participate in.

I bet they have a *phone*, too, and they probably receive cards and letters, and may *even* be on social media!\n\nOut of towners can be updated on your happy news -after the wedding. Good for you for not stealing the spotlight.\n\nYour mom is the problem here. Your brother and his wife-*the people that got married*-are glad you kept your news to yourselves. \n\nAnd good for you for not telling your mom in the down low because it sounds like she can be difficult.\n\nTake this as a lesson that you can never please everybody. But you can try to do the right thing. NTA", "NTA. You would have been had you announced that at their wedding. Most people don\u2019t go around physically to every person they\u2019re going to tell they\u2019re pregnant. Would you even be questioning this if your mother wasn\u2019t being ridiculous?", "NTA. You did the right thing - your family can share your good news remotely, it's miles better than overshadowing the wedding.  Which it would have done. \n\nIs your mom mad that family didn't get to share your news with you, or with her? Does she feel she missed out somehow?", "NTA\n \nYou did the right thing. I think your mom is probably upset because she didn't get the attention SHE wanted from family through your pregnancy announcement.", "NTA. It would have been rude and tacky to announce the pregnancy at someone else\u2019s wedding.", "NTA.\n\nAnnouncing a pregnancy or an engagement at someone else's wedding is classic overshadowing asshole behavior.  Your mother is thinking about extended family over your brother and his bride's wishes.\n\nYes it would have been nice to tell the others but it is very common to wait until the 2nd trimester, which you have just gotten to.  They will understand that you announced when you felt it was time to announce.", "NTA - your relatives were there to celebrate your brother\u2019s wedding.

If your mother is like mine she may be unaware of technology, but zoom, teams, email, text, WhatsApp, and any number of similar tools are just perfect for announcements! And congrats!", "NTA - and your mom is honestly a little biased here thinking people care that much about your pregnancy outside you immediate family. Sure let your Ma send photos when baby is born - but I never heard of announcing pregnancy to every relative far and wide", "NTA\n\nNo disrespect and I know you ve had a hard time, but it's a pregnancy. An every day miracle with emphasis on everyday.\n\nAlso it is still very early in the pregnant to be making a widespread announcement.", "NTA. You honestly would've been TA if you'd made an announcement about the pregnancy at the wedding. \n\n12 weeks along isn't that far. It's not far enough to feel the baby kick or anything, and not everyone is even comfortable with letting people feel that. I'm not sure what telling them in person vs on the phone or online would accomplish right now. It's not like they can even perceive the baby yet! \n\nBest wishes to you, and I hope this pregnancy is smooth and safe.", "NTA", "NTA You handled it the right way. You can send everyone an announcement like many cultures do via mail or online. Sounds like mom was thinking of herself more than the bride and groom.", "You did the right thing by NOT overshadowing your brother and sil's day with your news.  That would have been the AH thing to do and you didn't so NTA  congratulations.  You're mom is being a bit of a biotch here but she'll get over it.", "NTA. If you had announced it at the wedding, there is a good chance that you would still have upset family because it would have taken attention off of the bride and groom and put it on you. I think this would have been a lose/lose situation either way, and you chose the route that upset the least amount of people. Added to the fact that it is 100% your choice who to announce your pregnancy to and when. \n\nCongratulations, and I genuinely hope that all of your family learns how to support you the best that ALL of them can, without judging your decisions in this new stage of life!", "NTA", "NTA Your Mom is being selfish and hurting her relationship with her brand new DIL! Every Bride deserves her day! You and your wife showed her love and compassion and likely have started a special bond with her. Those relatives that likely won't return to Texas for years, if ever, didn't miss getting to see the baby...only getting to express good wishes. Congratulations to you and your wife!", "Some facts:\n\nYou didn't upstage your brother's wedding, so kudos to you\n\nYou're twelve weeks, there is nothing to see yet!\n\nHad you made the announcement your mum would have gotten a lot of the attention from her far-away family for becoming a grandma soon. \n\nYou do the math.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If telling the out of town family is soooooo important, does nobody have access to social media? Does nobody have postage stamps to send cards announcing?  I applaud your decision not to announce it at the wedding. I see so many AITA posts from people whose siblings have taken that path and \"ruined our special day\". Emphatically NTA. You owe nothing to people that you don't see for years at a time.", "NTA, there's Facebook, email, letters, or postcards to let them all know. Announcing a pregnancy at someone else's wedding is a big no no and attention seeky mum needs to get back in her lane", "NTA. You can  tell them remotely and announcing a pregnancy at a wedding is generally considered poor taste. Also 12 weeks is still early, do you even want to tell the whole extended out of town family yet? You don't have to", "NTA\nBless her heart.", " *My dad, brother, and sister-in-law were happy for us and my mom was upset.*\r  \n\r  \n*Not because we are expecting. Because we did not tell all the out of town family. We won't see most of them again for years. The only reason some were able to attend the wedding was because my dad has a billion air miles.*\r  \n\r  \n*So my mom said that we should have let everyone know. So they could be part of our good news. My brother thanked me for not overshadowing his wedding. My sister-in-law called me last night to thank me because she does not want to start shit with my mom. I didn't think it was the right thing to do but my mom makes a good point. Some of the guests won't be back in Texas for years.*\n\nAnd?\n\nIs this the 1800's where if you moved away from the village, you were never seen again and nobody could reach you? Does your mother know that telephones and computers, not to mention the post office exist?  How is telling someone in person rather than by email or text or face time different? If you will never see these people again for years (do they live in some remote village?), what difference does it make how you tell them if chances are slim to none that they will ever see your child in person?", "NTA. You were correct to avoid upstaging the newlyweds.", "NTA It would have been inappropriate to make an announcement at your brother's wedding. There are other ways to make an announcement to your family you're both expecting.", "No, your mother does not make a good point. If you only meet these people once every few years, you either aren't close to them, so there is no reason for them to be part of the announcement, or you maintain a close connection through calls and social media, so they will be part of your news digitally. This is an very odd thing for her to be upset about.", "First of all, congratulations. \n\nAside from immediate family or people you're very, very close to, most people don't mind if you announce your pregnancy over text, email or social media. Announcing it during your brother's wedding would have been very tacky and impolite. And it would have resulted in a lot of negative feedback. Your mom is wrong.\n\nJust make a cute Facebook and IG post and move on. NTA.", "> Some of the guests won't be back in Texas for years.\n\nSo why would telling them matter? Your kid will be their own person by the time these people ever see you guys again, so why would telling them matter?", "NTA A wedding celebration is the one day the bride and groom are the center of attention! The party is about two families welcoming each other\u2019s family into their family.\n\nYour baby announcement should be on a different date at a different setting like a luncheon for your family and your wife\u2019s family. You and your wife could be the stars of the baby announcement luncheon. If you go to a ballet do you jump out of your seat and dance with the prima ballerina? No, because you are not the star of the performance. No one should ever steal the show from the bride and groom at their wedding!", "NTA.\n\nSo what.\n\nWhat century is your mother living in? Surely Texas has email and FaceTime. The news will be just as impactful.\n\nEnjoy a healthy pregnancy and your new baby!", "NTA and your (awesome!) news is YOUR news to share as a couple, however and whenever you decide. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s excited but your mom simply does not get to lay any emotional claim upon your personal experience here, but just be supportive and follow your lead. No more toe-stepping, grandma! \n\nCongrats!!", "Do really distant family even need to know? Especially people u only see once in a blue moon", "Nta", "NTA. it was your brother's day, his and his wife. your instincts were correct. Did the guests tell you EVERY LITTLE THING they are doing/ of course not. it was your brother and SIL. 'nough said. your mom is wrong.", "NTA. It was your brother and SIL\u2019s wedding, and you did the right thing by prioritizing their feelings. Realistically, these relatives aren\u2019t going to be a huge part of your child\u2019s life and a phone call or email is a totally appropriate form of communication for letting them know.", "INFO\n\n> they could be part of our good news.\n\n*Part* of the news?\n\nWhat is that even supposed to mean?", "NTA - your gesture was kind and thoughtful, and your brother and SIL appreciated it, which was the goal. Your relatives will understand why you waited, and will be just as happy for your good news no matter how they hear it.", "Nta. They can share in your good news via message and when baby arrives. If you had announced at wedding you would have ruined the day for your brother and his wife.", "Usually this sub is full of \u201caita for revealing my pregnancy at my blah blah blah\u2019s wedding\u201d, so fair play to you and your partner for waiting until afterwards!!! NTA", "I think your mum might need a reality check mate, there are several more ways of telling family than at your brothers wedding.\n\nI'd have a long chat with her about proper behaviour if I were you, because she obviously doesn't know what it means.\n\nNTA.", "Your mom wanted to be part being the center of attention. That's all this is. You did the right thing. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, your mom has heard of a couple recent inventions, right? If not she might need to be updated on a couple: The Internet, The Telephone, International Post being the most relevant, because assumedly your international family has access to at least one. (Shitty sarcasm to one side, it sounds like she's just sour she didn't get a chance to flaunt being a soon-to-be grandmother in person)", "NTA", "NTA, send them all an e-mail saying that you didn't want to overshadow the happy couple but have some great news to share....", "NTA, we live in the 21st century. We have phone, emails, text messages even FaceTime! You can tell them more in person then before. They live in Texas but they aren\u2019t your immediate family. Your brother only gets married hopefully once and there is never a reason to outshine someone during their special time that is the truly the only day that is all about them. You did a good job of not outshining your brother and his wife!", "NTA just call and tell them ? happiness for good news wont decrease, sure, they could have celebrated together, but more importantly, the brothers wedding would be overshadowed.", "Nope. You were right and your brother and his wife were thankful. Obviously if your wife had been far enough along to be showing this might have had to be handled differently, but that\u2019s something you could\u2019ve discussed early on had that been the case.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s true, it probably would\u2019ve over shadowed their wedding.\n\nBut also, 12 weeks (congratulations btw!!) is awesome but it\u2019s bordering the 1st trimester. Given that you\u2019ve been trying for a long time, and this is early on, it would be totally fair for you to not be READY to share the pregnancy till later on with external family you know?\n\nYour mom is being selfish. She\u2019s mad because SHE wanted to share her excitement with the rest of the family. That alone tells me, SHE would\u2019ve caused and allowed it to over shadow their wedding.\n\nSo yea I would shut that down. Don\u2019t drag your brother and his wife into it though. Don\u2019t bring up their gratitude. Just stay firm. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to overshadow the wedding\u201d. And personally whether that was your prerogative OR not, I would add in \u201cfrankly we don\u2019t want so many people knowing this early on. We told you because we wanted you to know. Don\u2019t squander that kindness. We will tell everyone else when we are ready and comfortable to make that announcement.\u201d It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a big deal that it won\u2019t be in person. Most chances to tell extended family like that in person are not possible in the first. And others congratulatory events should not be used to make that happen.\n\nBut also, I\u2019m getting mad mom sharing vibes. That\u2019s not her right to share it. It\u2019s yours. Hope she doesn\u2019t break the announcement before you..", "Your mom does NOT make a good point.\n\nShe is only thinking of herself and how many people would have congratulated HER for having an upcoming grandchild.\n\nIT DEFINITLY would have pissed your brother and SIL off big time!", "Nta. Your brother and sis in law thanked you for not doing it. Who cares if they won\u2019t hear the news in person. What were they gonna do. Be happy and say congrats. They can do that on the phone. You did the right thing. The mother of the groom is always the dramatic one. Good thing she didn\u2019t know or she would have ruined the wedding.", "NTA These people don\u2019t have FaceTime, Zoom or any other way to connect? You were correct to keep the news to yourself. What AH would upstage a wedding? Not you because you\u2019re a good brother. Furthermore, your future child is nobody else\u2019s business. You are allowed privacy. You get to tell people when you want to. Or not. This baby (congratulations!) is your baby.", "Oh, I forgot if you are in Texas there are no post offices, telegrams, telephones, cell towers, computers, internet or social media.  WTH?  You absolutely did the right thing by not overshadowing the new couple.  Send everyone a message and congrats on the future.  Tell Mom you did it because you actually love your brother and SIL.  You are NTA.  Your dad, brother and SIL are good eggs.  Your mom is the cracked egg in the carton and an ahole.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou did the right thing!", "NTA \n\nGuests weren\u2019t going to stay to see future newborn. You did the right thing. \n\nMom is unhinged. It\u2019s not about \u201cyour good news\u201d for her, it\u2019s about her missed opportunity to bask in the \u2018Grandmom Spotlight\u2019.", "NTA. The telephone/FaceTime exist.", "NTA. Your mom is making your special news all about herself and her feelings. I'm willing to bet that this isn't the first time she's done something like that. You did the right thing by not overshadowing your brother's wedding.", "I would only understand the mom's point of view if the child had been born but not brought to the wedding. Yes of course they would have loved the opportunity to meet the new addition, but it's completely unnecessary to hear about a pregnancy in person.", "This.\n\nOP, you did the right thing! NTA.", "You don't know any of this with certainty!  They may still be communicating via telegram and smoke signals for all you know", "I've heard rumors that postal services are still in operation in countries like Denmark, Uruguay, and Australia, so a short, handwritten announcement  might possibly still arrive prior to the birth.", "I feel like his mom is upset she missed out on the extra layer of congratulations from these folks regarding her kids. Now it's like she didn't have anything to do with it!", "Wanna bet op is mom's favorite child?", "Yeah, I don't get it. If it were 1620 or something, and the Mayflower had just left with all her family, and she would never again see them until the afterlife or even be assured of a letter making it back across the ocean maybe, then I can understand. But today?", "seriously. \"you won't see some of those extremely extended family members for years!\"\n\nok, sounds like they don't need to know OP is expecting then. they can find out through social media, if they really have to be informed about this development.", "the mother wanted to boast about being a grandmother. now, she can't do it so she doesn't get all the attention she would've gotten at the wedding..", "And this mom is acting like social media doesn\u2019t exist", "This was refreshing in the midst of all the \u201cAITA for announcing my pregnancy at my sinling\u2019s/best friend\u2019s wedding?!\u201d posts. Good for you, OP. NTA and congrats!", "Seriously. It's not like baby was ready to meet anybody at the wedding!", "I live in Uruguay; can confirm. We even have this newfangled thing called the internet these days! Can you believe it?!", "That was my thought too. A double down on attention from all the relatives. \"Look, we are at my one son's huge wedding, and my other son is expecting! How blessed am I!\" Mom needs to chill out.", "I feel like mom wanted to be able to show off to her relatives, talk about being a grandmother and having both of your kids be settled. Some weird boomer flex like that.", " \n\nEspecially people you only see a blue moon once"]}
