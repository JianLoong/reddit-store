Further, it's somewhat obvious that it would be rude to announce a pregnancy at a wedding, and the sense of intentionally overshadowing the event.\n\nYour mom has a valid perspective too, and she is not an asshole for having it. This event was more than a wedding, and it seems it was also significantly a family reunion, that your parents had a major role in orchestrating.

You mom is absolutely incorrect and is no where near a good point unless you got specific approval before the wedding and included the then bride and groom in the pregnancy revelation in some way.

Also, announcing to non-close family members as you described is perfectly acceptable method through social media or send texts, cards in mail or whatever else is out there to do so.", "NTA for not upstaging your brother at his wedding. Your brother and SIL both thanked you for that; that's enough to tell you that you did the right thing.\n\nAlso, your mom is nuts: if you're not going to see these guests again \"for years\" they're obviously not people you're extremely close to emotionally, and they don't need to be told in person.", "NTA - telephones, email, video calls, social media, and postal mail are all things that can share the news.

Mom sounds like she wanted more than Mother of the Groom attention - maybe she wanted to be given grandma attention and congrats.  If so, the best interests of your brother/SIL is greater than those of just your mom.\n\nBe careful with your mom going forward.  If she can discard the best interests of your brother/SIL, she might be an overbearing GM.

You didnt want to ruin your siblings event and steal the spotlight. \n\nYou can tell people youre pregnant over social media. Other than a congratulations theres not much they can do until after Baby arrives. A wedding is an event people participate in. A pregnancy is kind of a one-wonan show until after delivery.", "Ya know what? The out of town guests *have email*. I bet they have a *phone*, too, and they probably receive cards and letters, and may *even* be on social media!\n\nOut of towners can be updated on your happy news -after the wedding. Good for you for not stealing the spotlight.\n\nYour mom is the problem here. Your brother and his wife-*the people that got married*-are glad you kept your news to yourselves. \n\nAnd good for you for not telling your mom in the down low because it sounds like she can be difficult.\n\nTake this as a lesson that you can never please everybody. But you can try to do the right thing. NTA", "NTA. You would have been had you announced that at their wedding. Most people don\u2019t go around physically to every person they\u2019re going to tell they\u2019re pregnant. Would you even be questioning this if your mother wasn\u2019t being ridiculous?", "NTA. You did the right thing - your family can share your good news remotely, it's miles better than overshadowing the wedding.  Which it would have done. \n\nIs your mom mad that family didn't get to share your news with you, or with her? Does she feel she missed out somehow?", "NTA\n \nYou did the right thing. I think your mom is probably upset because she didn't get the attention SHE wanted from family through your pregnancy announcement.", "NTA. It would have been rude and tacky to announce the pregnancy at someone else\u2019s wedding.", "NTA.\n\nAnnouncing a pregnancy or an engagement at someone else's wedding is classic overshadowing asshole behavior.  Your mother is thinking about extended family over your brother and his bride's wishes.\n\nYes it would have been nice to tell the others but it is very common to wait until the 2nd trimester, which you have just gotten to.  They will understand that you announced when you felt it was time to announce.", "NTA - your relatives were there to celebrate your brother\u2019s wedding.

It's just a pregnancy announcement and it would have taken attention away from your brother and his wife.  \n\nNTA.\n\nIt's weird that your mom is unhappy about this which makes me wonder about her true motives about wanting you to have disrupted the wedding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you had announced it at the wedding, there is a good chance that you would still have upset family because it would have taken attention off of the bride and groom and put it on you. I think this would have been a lose/lose situation either way, and you chose the route that upset the least amount of people. Added to the fact that it is 100% your choice who to announce your pregnancy to and when. \n\nCongratulations, and I genuinely hope that all of your family learns how to support you the best that ALL of them can, without judging your decisions in this new stage of life!", "NTA", "NTA Your Mom is being selfish and hurting her relationship with her brand new DIL!
