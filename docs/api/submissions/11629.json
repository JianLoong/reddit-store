Unsuccessfully unfortunately. Until now. We are on week 12 and all is good so far. \n\nI was my brother's best man and my wife did the video they played at the reception. She does that sort of thing as a hobby because she is an A/V need from back in the day. \n\nMy brother and his wife, had lunch with our parents and my wife and I yesterday. \n\nWe told them that we were expecting and it didn't go as we expected.  My dad, brother, and sister-in-law were happy for us and my mom was upset.  \n\nNot because we are expecting.  Because we did not tell all the out of town family. We won't see most of them again for years. The only reason some were able to attend the wedding was because my dad has a billion air miles. \n\nSo my mom said that we should have let everyone know. So they could be part of our good news. My brother thanked me for not overshadowing his wedding. My sister-in-law called me last night to thank me because she does not want to start shit with my mom.  \n\nI didn't think it was the right thing to do but my mom makes a good point.

Everyone they weren\u2019t T A but they were because they could\u2019ve waited for literally any other day. Thank you for not ruining the wedding by stealing the spot light you are a good brother. NTA", "NTA.  You shouldn't announce any other major news at someone's wedding.  If you had, you would be the TA.  It's not like you can't announce it online or even have a Zoom call now.  Your mother is being unreasonable.", "NTA. You did the right thing by making the announcement \"in private\". As compared to at your brother's wedding. To do otherwise is to grab the spotlight from the bride & groom, which is a seriously shitty move. Out of idle curiosity, does your mom dislike your sis-in-law? Because it almost sounds like she would have preferred to overshadow your brother & sis in-laws wedding with a baby announcement. Especially when I saw the line \"My sister-in-law called me last night to thank me because she does not want to start shit with my mom.\"", "If you had announced it you'd be here asking if you were an AH because your SIL and brother were mad at you. You made the right choice. NAH.", "NTA. Your mom is wrong. You absolutely made the right choice. You would have taken attention away from the couple on their wedding day.  It made me happy to read that you guys are expecting after some heartbreak. Good luck.", ">My brother thanked me for not overshadowing his wedding. My sister-in-law called me last night to thank me because she does not want to start shit with my mom.\n\nThat's all that matters. It was your brother and now sister-in-law's day and they appreciated your choice. \n\nNTA.", "Nta. You did the respectful thing to your brother and waited until after his wedding.", "NTA you did the right thing by not making his wedding all about your announcement.", "You don\u2019t have to be in front of somebody to tell them you\u2019re pregnant.\n\nNTA. These people would be going home regardless, so unless they\u2019re waiting around 9months to see this baby, which I doubt, then what else does she expect you to do? \n\nMake a Facebook post. Done. Everyone knows lol.", ">I didn't think it was the right thing to do but my mom makes a good point. Some of the guests won't be back in Texas for years.\n\nWho cares? A pregnancy announcement isn\u2019t that big a deal unless it\u2019s your very close family or very close friend. Those uncles and cousins aren\u2019t missing out on one of life\u2019s great experiences or anything.   \n\n\nNTA. Not just for letting your brother and sister-in-law be the center of attention for their wedding but also because no one gets to dictate when you want to share your news.", "NTA\n\nThe bride and groom are happy with how you conducted yourselves at their wedding. It\u2019s also common courtesy not to \u201csteal the spotlight\u201d from the bride. You did well.", "They'll hear it through the grape vine! NTA to the 5th power (at least \ud83d\ude01)", "NTA \n\nYour out of town family can learn the news via call, text, social media, or however else you chose and celebrate you and your wife that way and maybe they'll get together later for a baby shower. You did the right thing letting your brother and his wife have the day to themselves for their love to be celebrated.", "NAH. It's your family's pregnancy, and your decision when that news should be shared. Further, it's somewhat obvious that it would be rude to announce a pregnancy at a wedding, and the sense of intentionally overshadowing the event.\n\nYour mom has a valid perspective too, and she is not an asshole for having it. This event was more than a wedding, and it seems it was also significantly a family reunion, that your parents had a major role in orchestrating. It is something you could have *asked* your brother and SIL's permission if it was something *they would want*.\n\nBut you certainly weren't obligated to do this. Therefore, NAH.", "NTA.  You mom is absolutely incorrect and is no where near a good point unless you got specific approval before the wedding and included the then bride and groom in the pregnancy revelation in some way.  Take the compliments from your brother and sister in law as proof that keeping it to yourself was the correct route to take.  Also, announcing to non-close family members as you described is perfectly acceptable method through social media or send texts, cards in mail or whatever else is out there to do so.", "NTA for not upstaging your brother at his wedding. Your brother and SIL both thanked you for that; that's enough to tell you that you did the right thing.\n\nAlso, your mom is nuts: if you're not going to see these guests again \"for years\" they're obviously not people you're extremely close to emotionally, and they don't need to be told in person.", "NTA - telephones, email, video calls, social media, and postal mail are all things that can share the news. You did the right thing by now sharing the news at your brothers wedding. No idea why your mom is so bent out of shape.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is completely wrong. Has she never heard of email or social media or video calls? Do you cut contact the moment they are out of sight?\n\nThe only difference between telling them in person and telling them via video is that they can't hug you! You did the right thing! Do not let your mother second guess yourself.", "NTA.  It was the right decision not to hijack the wedding.", "NTA.. If there was no wedding all these people would have found out via email, social media, phone call or whatever type of communication you would have with them. You did right by not upstaging your brother and his wife..", "So NTA. You don\u2019t announce an engagement or a baby at someone else\u2019s wedding or reception EXCEPT if the bride and groom want you to.\n\nYou read the Bride and Groom correctly. They wanred their big say for everyone to focus on them\u2026and that\u2019s what you let them do.", "NTA You did the right thing in holding back the good news. That day was your brother's and his new wife's day. Congratulations to you & your wife and to your brother & his wife.", "NTA, it would\u2019ve been a massive AH move to tell everyone at the wedding. That was your brother\u2019s and SIL\u2019s event, and it wasn\u2019t yours to hijack. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in your mother\u2018s head but her idea is absurd. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not like that\u2019s news that needs to be told in person to people you rarely see. You did it everything right. \n\nCongrats on the pregnancy *and *on being a good brother!", "NTA. You followed etiquette. And honestly, they're family, I get that, but if these are people you go years without seeing... how important is it for them to know about your baby in person?", "NTA\n\nYou were correct to not upstage the wedding. The out of town relatives can be informed via email, phone, video call, etc. This is what would have happened had there not been a wedding at about the right time for you to tell people, and it is fine for it to be done that way.", "Not only are you NTA, but you did EXACTLY what you should do under the circumstances - keep your news until after so the attention can be on the bride and groom on their special day. Your mom is way off base.", "Woah... an aita post where a person *didn't* share pregnancy news at someone's wedding. Honestly this is refreshing and you are 1000% NTA! You did the right thing and your brother and new sil even said as much. Your mom needs to get over it. Well done op. NTA", "NTA.\n\nWill this be the first grandbaby?  Mom sounds like she wanted more than Mother of the Groom attention - maybe she wanted to be given grandma attention and congrats.  If so, the best interests of your brother/SIL is greater than those of just your mom.\n\nBe careful with your mom going forward.  If she can discard the best interests of your brother/SIL, she might be an overbearing GM.  Keep an eye on her and make sure you and your wife have some boundaries discussed and agreed upon before in case she does start to overstep.\n\nApologies if your mom is a wonderful mom and just got carried away.  The next few months will be very telling.  Keep your eyes wide open.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother and sister in law were thankful that you didn\u2019t and that\u2019s what matters. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to tell extended family in person, social media, email, texts, phone calls are all options.", "NTA Your mom can have the joy of calling the out of town guests and sharing the good news. I bet she\u2019s closer to them than you are anyway.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is wrong. Put it behind you and mom on as in 5 months this little difference of opinion won't matter.", "NTA. You didnt want to ruin your siblings event and steal the spotlight. \n\nYou can tell people youre pregnant over social media. Other than a congratulations theres not much they can do until after Baby arrives. A wedding is an event people participate in. A pregnancy is kind of a one-wonan show until after delivery.", "Ya know what? The out of town guests *have email*. I bet they have a *phone*, too, and they probably receive cards and letters, and may *even* be on social media!\n\nOut of towners can be updated on your happy news -after the wedding. Good for you for not stealing the spotlight.\n\nYour mom is the problem here. Your brother and his wife-*the people that got married*-are glad you kept your news to yourselves. \n\nAnd good for you for not telling your mom in the down low because it sounds like she can be difficult.\n\nTake this as a lesson that you can never please everybody. But you can try to do the right thing. NTA", "NTA. You would have been had you announced that at their wedding. Most people don\u2019t go around physically to every person they\u2019re going to tell they\u2019re pregnant. Would you even be questioning this if your mother wasn\u2019t being ridiculous?", "NTA. You did the right thing - your family can share your good news remotely, it's miles better than overshadowing the wedding.  Which it would have done. \n\nIs your mom mad that family didn't get to share your news with you, or with her? Does she feel she missed out somehow?", "NTA\n \nYou did the right thing. I think your mom is probably upset because she didn't get the attention SHE wanted from family through your pregnancy announcement.", "NTA. It would have been rude and tacky to announce the pregnancy at someone else\u2019s wedding.", "NTA.\n\nAnnouncing a pregnancy or an engagement at someone else's wedding is classic overshadowing asshole behavior.  Your mother is thinking about extended family over your brother and his bride's wishes.\n\nYes it would have been nice to tell the others but it is very common to wait until the 2nd trimester, which you have just gotten to.  They will understand that you announced when you felt it was time to announce.", "NTA - your relatives were there to celebrate your brother\u2019s wedding. Sharing your (wonderful!!) news at the wedding would have been AH behavior. Those people who love you will also be happy for you from a distance! If they have to be right in front of you in order to share in the joy, then probably not great family anyhow. \n\nI am not at all sure why your mother would be focused on extended family rather than the joyous news of an impending grandchild, but hopefully she wakes up soon! Congrats!\ud83c\udf89", "I disagree about your mom making a good point.  It's just a pregnancy announcement and it would have taken attention away from your brother and his wife.  \n\nNTA.\n\nIt's weird that your mom is unhappy about this which makes me wonder about her true motives about wanting you to have disrupted the wedding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
