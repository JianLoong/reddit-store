Weird take.", "Yup", "Why is that the correct thing? Like i said, it only negatively affects the kids. From how stupid and shitty the mom sounds i cant imagine they have very good lives.

And he might have been held liable. She put him at risk and she doesn't seem to care about it. Boohoo, poor mom, but like, she knowingly committed fraud and she did it intentionally against him. And she's doubling down by demanding he not get on with his life (and it's been years at this point) and keep a house/not sell/delay sale so her kids, not his, can keep committing fraud.\n\nThis woman isn't doing herself or her kids any favors.

Don't waste time saying something along the lines of we should fund the bad schools more, if that was going to happen it would have already and few towns have funding to throw around like that on their own. What, in this moment, under their control, are towns (rich or otherwise) supposed to do?", "Unfortunately, that is a risk she actively chose to take. What exactly are you expecting OP to do in this situation? They've been separated for years. They're not his children. His house is already on the market and they're already established to move locations. \n\nIt doesn't sound like OP has any intent to report the situation as it currently stands, only to continue with their rightful plan of moving.

What she's demanding is not realistic, even more so with today's housing market and cost of living. \n\nI do hope the children get to stay in their current school, but they not involved at all.

Deny having any knowledge or being involved in any way bc 10/10 chance if that crazy ass woman goes down she will do her very best to drag OP into it and bring him down with her somehow. 7 On top of point#6 even in the best case scenario with the least amount of drama involved, OP gains literally nothing and those children get fucked over for no reason.

There's also the likelihood of a family buying that house and having kids and then it would crop up then. You're defending the actions of someone in the wrong with a bunch of what ifisms and 'but he could have'. Sure. He COULD have, but she's an ex, they aren't his kids, and he's not obligated to hold himself in a position of legal liability because she's criminally minded. It's not morally correct to 'do nothing'. Didn't you ever watch Boondock Saints? (that's a tongue in cheek reference, but the reference there is that a good man doesn't stand idly by while evil is happening. Is this evil? No, but she's morally and legally in the wrong and he's trying to do his civil and legal best and 'just do nothing' is a shit way of looking at the world.)\n\nHe's reporting them because he's legally obligated to do once he realizes his address/identity is being used fraudulently.

Third, i dunno if you know this but people can live life by different moral codes. what you believe to he moral is not always going to be what i believe to be moral.

I just think your stance of 'do nothing' is bullshit and you're trying to put some kind of onus on the guy who had a dipshit ex who has felonious intent.

Your opinion is clearly skewed and not jiving with the majority rule opinion, which is 'screw that noise, call her out'. \n\nThink about perspectives all you want, but the fact is that you're advocating an idea that isn't going over well and there's a reason for it. Because it's screwing an innocent person over when he did nothing wrong. And there's too many vengeful people here, myself included in a petty way, to want her to just get off with having done something so shitty and shady without some kind of payback. She fucked up. He did not. He got his dick all the way out of crazy town and she still drove by to fuck his life up. And now she's trying to tell him to 'hold off on selling the house so my kids can go to school'. That's where people are giving you shit, because 'do nothing' doesn't apply here.", "YTA you re cold hearted.", "NTA. Your ex had no right to use your address like this without even telling you.

That's something at the very minimum that requires the cooperation of the poor dupe who's being used!", "NTA\n\nOk, i dont know how it works where you are. But where i live, you are listed on the electoral register, with your address. This is used for tax purposes along with it being used as evidence as previous adresses and such. \nI suggest if there are any official records like this, you request they be checked, to see if she has listed herself living at your address. It would need removing. You can explain the situation. But this will back you up in terms of issues with tax, fraud accusations, even potential legal ramifications. If shes taken out credit policies against your address it can fall back on you as the owner of the property etc\nYou need to have a good look into records, maybe ask a solicitor to see if they can advise any departments that need to be notified in order to cover your back. How you can check records and get updates. \n\nBut none of this is your fault. Shes taken advantage of the situation", "NTA, she pulled a cockamamie scheme that blew up in her face, and her kids get to suffer as a result.", "NTA\n\nSince they are not your children, you owe her no favors.", "NTA but surely she won\u2019t have her kids removed. Here in Aus you need to be in the area to get into the school, but once you\u2019re in the school, they don\u2019t remove you for then moving out of the area.", "NTA she is committing fraud..and is using you to do it without you even knowing.\n\nYou shouldn't have to put your life on hold for an ex bc they want to continue committing fraud smh her story is sad but it's not your problem", "NTA these aren't your kids you have no obligation to \"care\" for them. She needs to take care of her own problems. Her not telling you that she's using your address is definitely not legal im sure.", "NTA. The entitlement and audacity of your ex is astounding.", "NTA   None of this is...as you say...your problem.", "NTA. But the school doesn\u2019t care. My daughter continued to go to our old high school after we moved. We finally changed the address and they didn\u2019t care. \n\nIt\u2019s not illegal. The school won\u2019t kick them out.", "NTA.", "Not your kids, not your problem. NTA.", "A few years ago I looked for per student spending in Detroit public schools and in my city with relatively good schools. It was something around 14K in Detroit versus 9K in our city.", "This \ud83d\udcaf", "I'm pretty sure that Big Bird said that.", "That's my concern someone finding out and they try to go after him when he was completely clueless", ">Why are you married and talking to another woman with which you have no children?\n\nWhy is it a problem that a married man talks to another woman in general?", "Actually in our school district,  they care a lot. You need to provide two addressed pieces of mail to enroll and if there is any suspicion you're not in the correct district they will investigate and then expel the child/ren almost immediately. It's considered fraud.", "How so? They aren\u2019t his kids.", "Maybe you don't have to judge her for doing something potentially illegal, but I judge her for getting OP involved without even letting him know and then getting angry when he doesn't want to be part of fraud.\n\nIf it was just her, sure, I wouldn't care and if she used someone's address with their permission I wouldn't give a shit... but what she did was absolutely immoral and messed up.\n\nBig NTA for OP and ex is 100% being an ass.", "Like I said,  I'm not sure about the laws where OP is, but  she could be in legal trouble when they find out she is trying to send her children to a school district she doesn't live in. It's fraud. You can not just send your kids to any old school that you want. And if she gets in trouble, then she could say he allowed her to do it. He could be complicit in fraud as well.", "It is only considered fraud,  in some states, and not all.", "Hell no! He has ZERO responsibility to belatedly prop up her lies! If she really was so concerned she should have asked him to be a part of this instead of doing it without his knowledge then trying to guilt him into not living his life to uphold her deception. How ridiculous that anyone would try to further this guilt trip, even on this sub!", "Which came first the chicken or the egg?", ">raising 3 kids by themselves\n\nIs a poor life decision for sure.\n\nAnd OP NTA, of course.", "That already happens. It's called Robinhood.", "This is not actually a complicated question for someone who has even a middle-school level grasp of how evolution works.", "Wonder why no one seems to be holding absent dads accountable for their life choices. Oh wait, I know why. Women have actual parenting expectations placed on them, men can just leave and no one bats an eye.", "Not having more kids when you can't support the ones you already have shouldn't be complicated to anyone with a middle-school level grasp of math either.\n\nHence the poor life decisions.", "Yes, because birth control never fails, abortions are easy to get, and celibacy is a totally reasonable expectation. /s"]}
